t5_2qh2p,EvilWooster,1314853794,"The Word of God  Lyrics and melody © 1994 by Catherine Faber  From desert cliff and mountaintop we trace the wide design, Strike-slip fault and overthrust and syn and anticline. . . We gaze upon creation where erosion makes it known, And count the countless aeons in the banding of the stone. Odd, long-vanished creatures and their tracks &amp; shells are found; Where truth has left its sketches on the slate below the ground. The patient stone can speak, if we but listen when it talks. Humans wrote the Bible; God wrote the rocks.  There are those who name the stars, who watch the sky by night, Seeking out the darkest place, to better see the light. Long ago, when torture broke the remnant of his will, Galileo recanted, but the Earth is moving still. High above the mountaintops, where only distance bars, The truth has left its footprints in the dust between the stars. We may watch and study or may shudder and deny, Humans wrote the Bible; God wrote the sky.  By stem and root and branch we trace, by feather, fang and fur, How the living things that are descend from things that were. The moss, the kelp, the zebrafish, the very mice and flies, These tiny, humble, wordless things---how shall they tell us lies? We are kin to beasts; no other answer can we bring. The truth has left its fingerprints on every living thing. Remember, should you have to choose between them in the strife, Humans wrote the Bible; God wrote life.  And we who listen to the stars, or walk the dusty grade, Or break the very atoms down to see how they are made, Or study cells, or living things, seek truth with open hand. The profoundest act of worship is to try to understand. Deep in flower and in flesh, in star and soil and seed, The truth has left its living word for anyone to read. So turn and look where best you think the story is unfurled. Humans wrote the Bible; God wrote the world.  This song was inspired when a friend of mine complained to me about a run-in with some Creationists, and asked ""what can you say to such people?"" The first words that popped out of my mouth were ""humans wrote the bible. God wrote the rocks.""

t5_2r4b9,bird0026,1314895395,"Testosterone won't change bone structure like magic, but bones are in a constant process of changing, growing, and reforming. After a time on testosterone your facial features will (most likely) change a great deal into a much more masculine shape. I've been on T for about 5 months and I've already had a LOT of changes in my face. Given time, being on T will change your facial structure.  As for shoulders, the best thing I can imagine would be to just work out. If you lift weights, swim, or even run, you'll gain a lot of muscle mass. Guys naturally have more muscle mass than girls....so being on T will make developing muscle easier. It won't magically give you muscles and bigger shoulders, but it will help in the process of gaining them.  Plus, working out is good for you...and is infinitely cheaper than surgery.  As for hips, you can't change the major bone structure of that just by being on T or working out.... But I do know there is a surgery  called Body Masculinization. Here is a quote about it: ""ManSculpture ® Body Masculinization is commonly performed at the same time as FTM Top Surgery ®. This consists of shaping the body to a more ""masculine"" form with the use of Power Assisted Liposuction techniques.

His business partner got a 64 gig model with all the options.  They've been going back and forth on the phone as they try them out.   The biggest complaint my boss has is the lack of 3G connectivity.  All the release info stated they would have ""Bluetooth®, WiFi and 3G connectivity"" so my boss expected to be able to pop the SIM from his other tablet into it and get going.  Not the case however, the sim card pops right in but the tablet doesn't see it.  Apparently there is some confusion on this, several vendors had 2 different part numbers for each of the 3 models at release but the 3G doesn't seem to work on any of them (verifiably does not work on the ones my boss and his business partner got their hands on).  [Lenovo community forums](http://forums.lenovo.com/t5/ThinkPad-slate-tablets/3G-upgradable/td-p/515331) seem to indicate that the 3G-capable model won't ship until October, but they certainly didn't make that clear initially.   Other than that, after it gets online and runs updates it's pretty slick (it was running a little slow until updates completed, had my boss ready to send it back).  Like others are saying the handwriting recognition is pretty amazing, very accurate and snappy with an intuitive interface (circle text for context menus, scribble over text to erase, just what I figured out playing with it for a few minutes).  The general OS interface is nice but I'm not sure if this is specific to lenovo as this was the first time I got my hands on a Honeycomb tablet.   Overall it feels very solid and has some very good features, but apparently it'll be worth it to wait for the October release if you need the 3G capability.",®

I *have not* read that article, but I see some problems:  * When you calculate trajectories in GR when the moving particle itself has neglible effect on the field, you basically calculate [geodesics](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Geodesics), there are no 'anti geodesics' the antiparticles should move the same. Not really a problem with the idea though, and perhaps the news article just didn't read the paper properly.  * There is the symmetry 0=D\_μ G_μν = D\_μ (k T\_μν) on the stress tensor to follow, if you have two 'stress tensors' k1 D\_μ T1\_μν + k2 D\_μ T2\_μν=0 Actually this is an interesting quality that we expect, although if you can't make ends meet for like e_bar+e↔γ+γ , that'd make the thing rather more uninteresting..

In an email to the Tribune, attorney Michael Carin said school officials at Carver Primary School on the Far South Side authorized the on-campus security guard in March 2010 to discipline some first-graders who were being disruptive.  Giving details not disclosed in the lawsuit filed Monday in Cook County Circuit Court, Carin said the school's security officer removed the students from class and held them in another office on campus where there were no other adults present. Carin said the students were handcuffed for hours and told that ""they were going to prison and would never see their parents again.""  ""There appears to be no reason for an officer to isolate 6- and 7-year-old children, place them in handcuffs and threaten them for hours during a school day, or any other day,"" Carin wrote.  Carin said the Chicago Board of Education had ignored attempts to resolve this case outside the courtroom.  ""Unfortunately, we had to file a lawsuit because the Chicago Board of Education ignored my client on the day of the imprisonment and every day thereafter,"" Carin wrote. ""We hope the Chicago Board of Education acknowledges its responsibility and resolves the matter quickly.""  In the complaint, the boy's mother, LaShanda Smith, describes the guard's action as ""reckless"" and said her son suffered injuries both ""permanent"" and ""personal"" during the incident. Smith, who is seeking more than $100,000 in damages, accuses the officer of acting ""in conscious disregard"" of her son's safety.  CPS, along with the Board of Education, are defendants in the case. Neither the security officer nor school administrators are named as defendants.  CPS spokeswoman Becky Carroll said again Tuesday that school officials have not yet seen the complaint and need to review it before commenting. Calls to Carver Primary School were not returned.  jhood@tribune.com  Copyright © 2011, Chicago Tribune ",©

In August 2010, part of the Petermann Glacier about four times the size of Manhattan island broke off , prompting a hearing in Congress.  Researcher Alun Hubbard, of the Centre for Glaciology at Aberystwyth University, U.K., told msnbc.com by phone that another section, about twice the size of Manhattan, appeared close to breaking off. In 2009, scientists installed GPS masts on the glacier to track its movement.  But when they returned in July this year, they found the ice had been melting so quickly — at an unexpected 16-and-a-half feet in two years — that some of the masts stuck into the glacier were no longer in position.  Hubbard, who has been working with Jason Box, of Ohio State University, and others, said in a statement issued by the Byrd Polar Research Center that scientists were still trying to work out how fast the glacier was moving and the effect on the ice sheet feeding the glacier.   **'Really weird' **  But he said he was taken aback by the difference between 2009 and 2011 when he visited the glacier in late July.  ""Although I knew what to expect in terms of ice loss from satellite imagery, I was still completely unprepared for the gob-smacking scale of the break-up, which rendered me speechless,"" he said in the statement. ""I'm very familiar with the glacier. It's very hard to sort of envisage something so big not being there ... to come back and basically see an ice shelf has disappeared, which is 20 kilometers across (about 12 miles) ... I was speechless and started laughing because I couldn't sort of believe it,"" Hubbard added, speaking to msnbc.com.  ""It was really weird when the helicopter first came over,"" he added.  Hubbard told msnbc.com that he had gone to the glacier to recover instruments used to monitor the glacier and time-lapse photographs.  ""What I saw there is this ice shelf is riddled with rifts and cracks. You can see another big rift another 10 to 15 kilometers (6 to 9 miles) back into"" the glacier, he said. Hubbard said the large rift, which the researchers have dubbed ""The Big Kahuna,"" was getting bigger. He was cautious about predicting when it would create a new vast ice island, but said it could happen ""maybe next year, something like that.""  **'Abnormally warm'**   He said while sea glacier's ""calving"" of ice bergs was a natural process, they were witnessing something out of the ordinary.  ""The break-off last year is bigger than anything seen for at least 150 years,"" Hubbard said.  ""This region (northern Greenland) is experiencing temperatures which are abnormally warm ... I think the far northwest of Greenland is seeing a kind of new regime of climate,"" he added.  The Humbolt Glacier, the widest in the northern hemisphere, is also retreating, Hubbard said. He said he was not a climate scientist, but said the pattern of ice melting in the area was ""a definite consequence of climate change and global warming.""   Writing in the Annals of Glaciology journal, published on Aug. 22, the researchers said Greenland's glaciers had collectively lost 592.6 square miles of ice between 2000 and 2010.   The August 2010 ""calving"" event saw the creation of an ice island of 112 square miles, causing the Petermann Glacier to retreat by about 8 miles.   The island contained enough water to keep the Delaware or Hudson rivers flowing for two years or to provide the entire U.S. with tap water for 120 days, Andreas Muenchow, professor of ocean science and engineering at the University of Delaware, said at the time.  The Byrd center statement, which summarized the journal report, said while this loss of ice was ""extreme compared with others ... it is part of a larger pattern of ice area loss concentrated in north Greenland.""   Twice as many glaciers are retreating as the number that are advancing, and the area of ice lost was nine times the amount gained, the researchers found.   **'Harbinger of many changes'**   At the Congressional hearing in August 2010, the then chairman of the Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming, Rep. Edward Markey, said the melting of the Greenland ice sheet was ""but one harbinger of the many changes to come.""  ""Scientists, skeptical by both nature and training, always urge a dose of caution when looking at any one event as evidence of climate change,"" he said in his opening statement. ""This level of professional skepticism is what makes the overwhelming scientific consensus that climate change is real and caused by man all the more powerful.""  Markey listed extreme weather events, such as a record-breaking heatwave and drought in Russia, extreme floods in Asia, record-breaking temperatures on the Eastern Seaboard of the United States and ""mega storms and floods"" in many parts of the country.  ""Take a step back from these individual pieces and we see a mosaic that could not be clearer. Our world is becoming less hospitable with every passing year,"" he added.  © 2011 msnbc.com Reprints ",©
t5_2r9vp,ShowPig,1314948988,"If you still have him- my family has rehabilitated countless wild animals (including baby squirrels) and I thought I would put in my two cents.  I'm going to be upfront with you, he might not make it. He's pretty young (he looks about 5-6 weeks old) and with the bleeding from his nose/mouth area he likely have internal bleeding. He could have fallen or been attacked by another animal. The best you can do is make him comfortable tonight and do a few things that could potentially save his life, if he hasn't been injured too badly.  [Here's a website that tells you how to keep him warm without hurting him](http://www.squirrelworld.com/ifounda.html), which is important since he's so young he won't be able to maintain his temperature as well. There is also a lot more info on this website so I would give it a read.  For now though, set him up so he's being kept warm. In the meantime keep him covered, maybe in a towel, loose enough he isn't being squished.   ""Very important to keep the baby warm.  This means an outside source of heat.  Putting the baby in a cardboard box with just a towel is a sure way to kill the baby.  If the body temperature drops and is low for any period of time, the organs start to shut down, then death. Ideal temperature for source of heat is 98.5 degrees.  Allow for the baby to cuddle up to heat source, giving room to back off if he/she gets too hot."" Don't try to feed him until he is warm again.  Get a washcloth and wet it with warm water (not hot, test it on the inside of your arm first.) Wipe the blood off of his face because if it blocks his nose he could have trouble breathing.  He is also at an age where dehydration can be fatal very quickly. The website puts it better than I can- ""Use a 1c.c. syringe (without the needle) by mouth.  To rehydrate, use Pedialyte® or if nothing else Gatorade®.  Warm a small amount to luke-warm temperature.  The amount per feeding will vary according to age of baby.  A good starting point is 1/10th of a 1c.c. per week of age every hour for 12 hours. 12 hours is usually long enough to rehydrate the baby squirrel.  This also allows the baby to get used to the syringe and if he/she aspirates anything into the lungs, it will be absorbed with less chance of developing pnumonia.  Go very slowly until he/she gets used to the taste and the syringe.  If you have stuff bubble out the nose or he/she snorts through the nose, you are going too fast or the baby is having problems swallowing.  Take your time.""  Put him in a quiet, dark place, where he won't be bothered. He's probably pretty stressed out and small animals can die of stress- I've seen it happen before and you don't want to. Don't pick him up or move him around more than you have to. Baby squirrels at this age aren't aggressive and probably won't bite in self defense but always be cautious. He could also have broken bones so be very mindful and delicate with him when you move him.  This guy might not be a good candidate for survival so don't be too hard on yourself if he dies. They're really vulnerable at this stage in their life because they're old enough to wander out of their nests but they can't fend for themselves so they do things like fall out of trees onto concrete or get picked up by predators. If nothing else you can assure he dies in his sleep in a warm nest instead of being hit by a car or dying of exposure.  Just make him comfortable and warm and try to get some fluids in him. The hardest part is the first night. Good luck and there needs to be more people like you in this world.  ",®

t5_2qh1i,Elliptical_Tangent,1314978181,"1. The short answer is this is a really large country, and it manifests in 2 ways: * If we are paid well, it's often in a city far away from our place of birth.  Couple that with our lowest-in-the-developed-world vacation time, and we wind up using vacation to see family at holidays. * The country is so big, and there's so much to see that many people die without having seen most of it.  Add in that traveling to see family eats up about half of our vacation, it's more rewarding to just go see the Grand Canyon than take a trip to Europe (or any other country) for a week.  2.  I don't think this is true.  I'd need an example contrasting behavior in other countries to understand the question properly.  We're very self-deprecating, but maybe you mean our attitudes towards our country?  In that, we are not so self-deprecating, it's true.  Why? I'm not sure I can say, but I'd suspect it has to do with the mythology surrounding our involvement in WWI and WWII.  3.  To be clear, the majority in prison is white just like outside prison, but the ratio of minority/black to white is higher in prisons than outside.  It's big business.  If we spent the money to educate everyone properly, our crime rate would go down, but that would be money put into the government.  Instead, we leave whole segments of society, the poor, without any options save crime.  Then we spend billions on private security and private prisons to house these people.  That money goes to corporations.  Ultimately, the problems the United States have, including prison populations, boils down to being the most wealthy country on the planet.  We have so much money concentrated at the Federal level that everyone's spending money in legal bribes to get a piece of the action.  So the people suffer.  4.  It's a good question.  I could answer by saying if your sister is a whore, you might get angry and tell your friends what a whore she is, but then if your friends call her a whore, you yell at your friends.  It's also difficult to take criticism from other countries because few of them understand the amount of corruption that our wealth and power bring.  It fees a little like if a rich person looks at a poor person and says, ""Why don't you dress better?""  There's often a lack of understanding involved in the criticism.  5. You know, that's much more complicated than the question suggests.  We dislike elitism intensely in this country.  Many of us also dislike hearing people call the USA the best country in the world.  However, patriotism is the opiate of the disenfranchised masses.  Fully half of the population live below our incredibly low standard of poverty.

t5_2qh1i,epiclogin,1314991975,"The fixes to the USA that I would suggest are:  - Strengthen the dollar versus other foreign currencies through sound economic principles. This hopefully will bring more jobs to the USA.  - Reduce the size and influence of our Federal Government, while lowering taxes. This returns money back to the states and to the people.  - People talk all about the tax code with flat tax and the FairTax™, but those are lofty goals that will never happen in one fell swoop. This needs to take place in phases, instead. First, start reducing the variety of deductions while at the same time flattening (sort of -- not too drastic initially) the tax rate percentages. In the second phase, start a policy of taking tax revenue surpluses and applying them to the deficit. Third, begin the trajectory to the FairTax™.  - Stop brainwashing our kids in our schools on national patriotism and the American Dream. Instead, encourage the Socratic Method of teaching for these principles, encouraging them to think about what the gain is from these ideals, and whether they exist at all currently, and what can be done in our country in order to return to these ideals if they think they don't exist.  - Continue strict laws on illegal immigration, while reducing red tape (where reasonable) for legal immigration processes.  - Cut military spending by half and bring more of our troops home.  - Our infrastructure is falling apart. No wonder businesses from other countries don't want to build plants here. Our states need to return to balanced budgets with sound economic policies until we have the money to rebuild our infrastructure again, and without federal handouts. By shrinking the size of our Federal Govt and lowering federal taxes, our states can balance their budgets better and can move towards balancing their budgets first, and then rebuilding our infrastructure second.  - A national, non-religious, private organization (not a union-type organization) needs to be created that encourages businesses to get together quarterly to work on solving problems in communities. I see local baseball fields for children that are funded by businesses which then put up signs to advertise there. So, it's an example of something with a cost and a benefit as well. We need to continue and broaden this. Meanwhile, on another front, we have those who like meeting together in their religious organizations to help a community, and I want to encourage that as well too.  - Encourage more right-to-work legislation to limit the power of unions which cripple our country.  - Encourage more competition for phone and cable service in order to break up the regional monopolies. The goal here being to try and give more people a chance to have cheaper service and to get online with more bandwidth -- a vital thing for teleworkers, because teleworking and freelancing is going to be the wave of the future for a long time to come. Less and less people will work in a regular office as fuel costs and other national financial issues are worked out.  - Defund and repeal Obamacare. Yes we need sensible healthcare reform, and it starts with tort reform. The Heritage Foundation has made excellent suggestions for healthcare reform that need to be experimented with slowly. They do not mandate healthcare but do work towards making it more affordable. And if we can't defund and repeal Obamacare, then we simply isolate it to an opt-in. If you opt-in, then all funding for it is paid by your tax dollars. Those who do not opt-in do not receive it and their tax dollars are not spent to fund it. The entire operation is isolated and funded entirely by those taxpayers who opt-in, with no borrowing permitted from any other budget -- it must be self-contained, or it must raise rates as necessary with its opt-in taxpayers. And if we opt-in, it must not involve businesses whatsoever -- it must be controlled by monthly or quarterly billing to the taxpayers who opt-in for it.  - Bring back non-marijuana hemp production. Allow our farmers to process this lucrative crop.  - We are losing the drug war and we can't afford to fill our prisons with Class A drug offenders anymore. Therefore, we need to legalize Class A drugs as a two-year study to see if this reduces drug-related crime yet stabilizes drug-related car accidents and drug-related workplace accidents. If this study works, then vote to renew it for 10 years and continue studying it. And then continue renewing it until it becomes a fact of life. As well, when this legislation is in place, permit marijuana farming only by state-approved and state-inspected farmers, and only while the federal legislation is intact during this study.  - Add a middle school and high school class called Global Cultures, and it's goal is to prepare students to interact with others in a global economy, whether it's understanding how Indian speakers sound and some of things that might often offend them (discussions on gambling or eating beef come to mind), or knowing that there's a lot of bribery in Russian and Chinese business transactions unfortunately. Perhaps that might be going overboard, but somehow we've got to bring the children to the reality that we're a global economy, and the headquarters of a company will often be in another country in the future, not here, and many of your coworkers will often be in another country that we communicate with over Skype or email.",™

t5_6,editor_ijaet,1315052901,"Due to their reliability, performance and rapid prototyping, programmable logic devices overcome the use of ASICs in the digital system design. However, the similar solution for analog signals was not so easy to find. But the evolutionary trend in Very Large Scale Integrated (VLSI) circuits technologies fuelled by fierce industrial competition to reduce integrated circuits (ICs) cost and time to market has led to design the Field-Programmable Analog Array (FPAA) which is the analog equivalent of the Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). In fact, the use of FPAAs reduces the complexity of analog design, decreases the time to market and allows products to be easily updated and improved outside the manufacturing environment. Thus, the reconfigurable feature of FPAAs enables real time updating of analog functions within the system using the Configurable Analog Blocks (CABs) system and appropriate software. In this paper, an interesting analog phase shift detection circuit based on FPAA architecture is presented. In fact, the phase shift detection circuit will distinguish a faulty circuit from a faulty-free one by controlling the phase shift between their corresponding outputs.  The system is practically designed and simulated by using the AN221E04 board which is an Anadigm product. The Circuit validation was carried out using the AnadigmDesigner®2 software.",®

What linked many of them together, including Aylward, was their association with the giant US income protection company UnumProvident, represented at the conference by John LoCascio. The goal was the transformation of the welfare system. The cultural meaning of illness would be redefined; growing numbers of claimants would be declared capable of work and 'motivated' into jobs. A new work ethic would transform IB recipients into entrepreneurs helping themselves out of poverty and into self-reliance. Five years later these goals would take a tangible form in New Labour's 2006 Welfare Reform Bill.’…….     …..‘In the 1980s Unum - along with the two other major life and accident insurance companies, Provident and Paul Revere - had been doing well from providing 'own occupation' income protection schemes for mainly upper income professionals. Insurance against loss of earnings caused by accident or sickness was seen as a lucrative market with strong growth potential. Profit for insurance companies mainly lies in the revenue generated by investing the monthly insurance premiums, and interest rates were high so the companies enjoyed high levels of profitability; they monopolised the sector by sharing a similar disability income policy that offered liberal terms.    Two factors threatened future profits however. The first was falling interest rates, and the second was the growth in new kinds of 'subjective illnesses', for which diagnostic tests were disputable. The old industrial injuries were giving way to illnesses with no clear biological markers - Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (ME) or Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS), Fibromyalgia, Chronic Pain, Multiple Sclerosis, Lyme Disease. In the early 1990s the new kinds of claims began to rise just as interest rates fell: profits were threatened. Unum's 1995 'Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Management Plan' sounded the alarm: 'Unum stands to lose millions if we do not move quickly to address this increasing problem'.4    ‘It was actually Provident [UNUM] that was quickest off the mark, introducing an aggressive system of 'claims management' that would become the industry norm. It could not influence interest rates, but it could reduce the number of successful claims it paid out. Its Independent Medical Examination (IME) was skewed in favour of the company through the work undertaken by its claims adjusters and in-house doctors.     Illnesses were characterised as 'self-reported' and so thrown into question. Only 'objective' test results were accepted. Some disabling conditions were labelled as 'psychological', which made them ineligible for insurance cover beyond 24 months. Doctors were pressured to use the 'subjective nature' of 'mental' and 'nervous' claims to the company's advantage.   Specific illnesses were targeted in order to discredit the legitimacy of claims.     The industry drew on the work of two of the Woodstock conference [‘Malingering and Illness Deception’] participants, Professor Simon Wessely of King's College and Professor Michael Sharpe of Edinburgh University [PACE Trial CBT/GET Researcher] , in an attempt to reclassify ME/CFS as a psychiatric disorder.  Success would allow payouts to be restricted to the 24 month limit for psychological claims and save millions of dollars. By 1997 Provident had restructured its organisation to focus on disability income insurance as its main business. It acquired Paul Revere, and then in 1999 merged with Unum under the name UnumProvident.……'  ",©

t5_2qh8y,LockAndCode,1315239709,"I was going to mention that one too, but got sidetracked:  The Air Force needs new camo so they approach Tiger Stripe Products, creators of the original Vietnam tiger stripe camouflage, to develop a new pattern. The initial blue and green color palette requested by the Pentagon asshats baffles both Tiger Stripe and the Air Force community in general. When critics point out that it's utterly **useless** as camouflage, the asshats backpedal and claim that the Air Force doesn't engage in direct combat, so it's really not necessary for it to work. That prompts RED HORSE, FAC, and AFSOC personnel to declare them thus fools, and *demand* a usable camouflage. Asshats retreat and withdraw the stupid blue stripe camo.  While considering alternates, AF brass looks at the Army's new mostly-gray UCP and says ""yeah! we want some of that!"" and goes on to request the existing Tiger Stripe™ blue pattern they commissioned in 2002 with the Army's gray digital bullshit and creates initial ABU pattern. The new ABU is approved based on a bunch of nonsense arguments including 1) the Army uses those colors so they must be good camo, 2) we can use Army MOLLE gear because the colors match. However, rather than actually redesigning the uniform to use modern materials and improved utility like the Army did with the ACU, they simply added extra pen pockets to the old heavy-weight BDU pattern and called it a day. The end result was a uniform that stains easily, is hot as fuck, still bunches and binds in all the places the BDU did, and most important **doesn't work as camouflage**.  Best of all, now that the Army is slowly edging away from the UCP/ACU boondoggle and towards the more sensible MultiCam, there's a very real possibility that the Air Force will end up having to special order UCP/ABU color MOLLE gear because the Army isn't using it anymore.  [This is a good timeline](http://www.tigerstripeproducts.com/airforcetiger.htm#Development of ABU Pattern) of the AF ABU development by the Tiger Stripe Products people, explaining how it all went down and ending with a heartfelt apology letter about how they *tried* to get the Air Force into an awesome, usable uniform, but how the Air Force chairborne asshats simply wouldn't listen.",™

t5_2cneq,Not_Joking,1315250010,"I did not read this article.  Only the title.  The title alone begs me to talk to you.  Begin with 300,000 people.  Sounds like a lot of people.  I wouldn't want to be alone catering for that many.  Also sounds like not so many people.  Hospitality industry site CatererSearch.com estimates Burger King has roughly 340,000 employees worldwide.  Even with the full staff of Burger King behind you, you cannot stand just around Washington DC and expect to Have It Your Way®.  What about the extrapolated Isreal to United States figure, 12.9 millon people?  Well that's a bigger number.  Not as large, mind you, as the 24.5 million people reported to have been watching *Friends* on September 27th, 2001, but large enough.  I'm asked to imagine about 13 million people going to Washington DC marching for change.  But is that a real parallel?  I've got Google Maps set to 50mi scale on [Israel](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=google+maps+israel&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=31.28794,35.804443&amp;spn=4.280558,9.316406&amp;gl=us&amp;t=h&amp;z=7&amp;vpsrc=6) and [New Hampshire](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=google+maps+united+states&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=43.882057,-71.268311&amp;spn=3.792703,9.689941&amp;gl=us&amp;t=h&amp;z=7&amp;vpsrc=6).  They look about the same size to me.    Now, I'm from NH and I know that there's a difference between me going to an event 3 hours away, way up in Berlin, NH, and my going to an event, say, in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Namely, I could go to a march in NH as long as I can afford about $75 for gas and tolls, and get a day off from work.  I cannot afford to go to New Mexico, a solid 38 hour drive away.  For myself, and too many other Americans, this trip would mean missing rent or mortgage payments, probably losing their job.  A 13 million person march on Washington is an incongruous analogy.   Never mind that, let's say that number of people, 13 million, do go to Washington and shuffle about protesting for change.  Since they are coming from all over the US the average travel expense is going to have to be *at least* $200 per person.  So 13 million people collectively spend $2.6 billion dollars to protest.  Before you say that I'm missing the point, wouldn't a 13 Million person march have a tremendous effect on government policy, I'll answer you now.  Yes, yes it would.  As a strictly practical matter, if 13 million people actually decided to go to a protest in Washington right now, we would experience an immediate and unmistakeable shift in policy.  Highways around the country would be blocked by tanks.  The eastern seaboard radiating out from the capital would be a network of roadblocks and outposts.  Nationally, air travel would be restricted, almost curtailed.   In roadblocks and home invasions the people on a list of potential terrorists would summarily and without civility be detained indefinitely with no right to stand accused.  All major cities would be under curfew.  The shock of this to the American people would be completely pacified by the American business-as-usual media.  In fact, things will look bringt right away, because those pesky unemployment numbers are quickly remedied hiring more homeland security forces.  More buying power!  Main street America on it's way to recovery!  If 13 million people march on Washington, we push for the endgame.  We lose.  Let's overlook that.  A huge protest on Washington.  13 Million peaceful people with signs and talking points.  Cacophony.  A few coherent themes.  In a protest, the protestors aren't really looking for the attention of the government.  The government is aware, they just don't care.  The protestors are looking to get the attention of the public, to directly appeal to their countrymen, and earn their support.  13 Million people voting won't elect them a President, and a president alone is a weak gambit to play opposting an entrenched corpocracy.  They want public support.  Too bad.  They can't have it.  You are still reading.   You are ahead of the curve.  Most people get their reality from mainstream media.  If it's not on TV, it didn't happen.  If it is, then that's exactly how it happenned.  No if's ands or buts.  We cannot reach these people by having a march.    And involve them we must.  We have to have at least their vote, if we want to maintain a democracy.  And we do.  But instead of a big march, let's take our 13 million protestors and 2.6 billion dollars and build a sociological juggernaut, our own well funded real-world corporate ""person"" with tens of thousands of employees and one dedicated purpose;  To identify what's wrong for so many people and then do it right.  Notice that the goal is not to ask anyone else to change what they are doing.  It's to identify our problems, and step in to make changes. Let's not make a gigantic futile gesture.  Let's take over.",®

These are based entirely on the results of our global academic survey unlike the more sophisticated approach taken to derive the QS World University Rankings® by Subject  at the bottom of this page someone asks this:  &gt;How does QS choose which university to include in the ranking? If a university wants to be assessed, what are the steps to be done?  and receives this response:  &gt; It very much depends on which particular ranking you are referring to. The subject rankings are based on a survey of academics and employers and citations per paper. Qualifying institutions have to be producing a threshold level of research in the discipline and offer programs therein. The first and most important step is to make sure you are listed. For this you can write to Baerbel Eckelmann on baerbel@qs.com – she will check your records and make sure you have access to our data system QS Core. Regardless of whther you feature in our rankings, every university is entitled to a profile on our website. THis will enable you to supply a range of data about your institution and we can assess the best next steps from there.  so there you go. i'm still in the dark as to who carries out the global survey and how reputation, for example, is assessed. i hope someone at a prestigious non uk/us university can offer some insight.",®

t5_2qpp6,physicsnick,1315353091,"A cloaked warp prism wouldn't really be a big deal. He certainly won't warp units in if you have a handful of Zerglings sitting under it or they'll die before they finish. Un-deploying is risky as well because it could be shot down once visible. This gives you plenty of time to finish your Lair and get an Overseer.  I don't think the cloaking would be too useful for harass after getting that first warp-in off. I think it would be useful mostly just for keeping them hidden about the map.  I agree that there's a lack of clarity with distance-based cooldowns. Blizzard seem resigned to floating numbers on the battlefield, such as [showing minerals returned when cancelling a building](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDTKXEHb9v4&amp;t=5m7s); how about a clock icon that floats up from a unit being warped in with the number of seconds the associated Warp Gate will cooldown?

t5_2rbms,raynejarre,1315375231,"Sure! It can be a bit hard to explain, but lets break it down a bit. To start out, you have two ""Heavy"" Desktop environments, two ""Light"" desktop environments (There are more, but lets just stick with the major ones), and then a vast majority of Window Managers. Also, I recommend looking at the ArchWiki. Even if you are not using Archlinux, it is by far one of the better linux Wiki's out there, and most of the information fits across distributions (For example, the [Desktop Environment](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Desktop_Environment) document)  When we talk about a desktop, we generally think of a Desktop Environment. A Desktop Environment contains several applications, which when combined, make a full desktop suite. Of these, Gnome and KDE are the most popular, probably followed by XFCE, then LXDE, and then quite a few others (Such as myself, or the crunchbang distribution) who decide to mix-and-match to make something of their own.  [Gnome](http://www.gnome.org/)- ""GNOME is an international community dedicated to making great software that anyone can use, no matter what language they speak or their technical or physical abilities."" Gnome is what came in Ubuntu pre-11.04, and was quite popular for quite a long time. It contained the gnome-panel, which allowed you to add panel applets, used the Metacity window manager, the Nautilus file manager, Gnome-terminal for a terminal emulator. It aimed to be simple and intuitive, while maintaining customization. Recently, it updated to version 3, which has split the community slightly. Several people criticize Gnome 3 for being less customizable. In my personal experience, I don't entirely think this is true, but it is at a very new state, so many features are not yet implemented. In the newer version of gnome, panel apps can be found in the form of gnome-shell-extentions, which are similar to the panel applets from gnome 2, but a bit more flexible. I honestly think that in time, Gnome 3 will be better. However, I feel it currently lacks a bit of polish. Some will disagree with me  [KDE](http://www.kde.org/)- ""The KDE® Community is an international technology team dedicated to creating a free and user-friendly computing experience, offering an advanced graphical desktop, a wide variety of applications for communication, work, education and entertainment and a platform to easily build new applications upon. We have a strong focus on finding innovative solutions to old and new problems, creating a vibrant atmosphere open for experimentation."" - KDE Attempts, much like gnome, to create something that is open, flexible and easy to use. It has a strong following as well (Though, much like gnome, had a lot of community dischord with the move from KDE3 to KDE4). KDE has strengths in that it has a lot of applications that come internal to KDE, which provides a lot of continuity between the applications, however, KDE is often criticized for the QT+ framework it runs on, as it adds additional bloat for some users (For example, with KDE, you will need the QT runtime for the KDE applications, and will likely run into the GTK runtime if you needed a GTK application, such as GIMP, LibreOffice, etc.) This makes some edge away from KDE.  You can find a good comparison between KDE and Gnome [Here](http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/kdegnome)  [XFCE](http://www.xfce.org/)- ""Xfce is a lightweight desktop environment for UNIX-like operating systems. It aims to be fast and low on system resources, while still being visually appealing and user friendly."" - For a long time, XFCE was the lower-end computer's Desktop Environment of choice. It is light on resources, and quite snappy because of it. In addition, XFCE is Stable, both in the fact that it has few bugs, and in the fact that it hasn't really changed a whole lot over the years (Unlike how gnome recently decided to revamp itself). It runs off GTK, like gnome, and is favored by quite a few people. Some people however feel it is harder to customize it to the extent of Gnome. You can decide for yourself, there is a ton of screenshots [here](http://www.xfce.org/about/screenshots) and [here](https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=84840)  [LXDE](http://lxde.org/)- ""The ""Lightweight X11 Desktop Environment"" is an extremely fast-performing and energy-saving desktop environment"" - LXDE aims to be lightweight, and modular. It uses the Openbox window manager, and has several internally developed applications for various things (Such as the lxterminal terminal emulator, and lxappearance to change GTK themes). Because of its modular nature, it allows you to pick alternatives a bit easier. However, it is also a bit harder for people who are not interested in tweaking to pick up, especially things like the application menu.  As for [Window Managers](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Window_managers), there is a ton of options. Basically, a window manager does just that. It manages your windows. Nothing more, nothing less. It allows your to resize windows, provides that little close button, allows your to move them, and thats it. Generally, window managers are used as alternatives for the window manager that already exists in a desktop environment (For example: Metacity is the default gnome Window Manager, however several people replace it with Compiz. This is what gives you the pretty window effects and such). There are a few different types of window managers as well - Tiling, Stacking, and Dynamic. Stacking is what you are likely used to, Tiling will automatically tile your windows ([here](http://gigamlol.deviantart.com/art/AwesomeWM-Desktop-27-01-75753423) is an example of a tiling window manager (Awesome) with 3 windows), they take some getting used to. And dynamic window managers, which do both.  Generally, unless you like tweaking a lot of things, or enjoy reading and learning a lot, you probably would want to stick with a Desktop Environment, as they are much quicker to set up to a working state. Sorry much for the wall of text, and hopefully this was useful to you. Everyones ideal desktop is a bit hard to pin down, as everyone has a different thought on what looks nice, and what is functional to them. Personally, I often can't make up my mind and switch through several. I tend to enjoy the lighter desktops more (I usually either run the Awesome window manager, Openbox+Tint2(Known as the ""Crunchbang"" configuration), LXDE, or XFCE. This is because I use linux on my Netbook, and I like it being very snappy. At any rate, let me know if you want any more info. I will be happy to provide it :)  (P.S.: Also, check out [This](http://linux-news.org/?p=2413) link. It is another overview of the various Desktop Environments.)",®

Is it just a bunch of Eastern cultural cruft, a whole lot of mumbo-jumbo polluting the heart of Zen (false positive)  or is it a useful transitionary post-zazen vehicle, practising harmonising with others as a way to  take the attention/sincerity you practice during laboratory conditions a bit closer into the real world (true positive)?  I don't know myself – IANAZM – but I think that this sort of framework  good be a useful guide for thinking about the nature of Zen practice.  Personally, I feel more at home in a traditionalist group, not for because I think it preserves some sort of orthodox truth but because I largely sense that millennia of (slow! ongoing!) evolution is a safer route, that the benefits of fending off a lot of newfangled negatives outweigh the risks of missing out on some good stuff or of accreting some useless cultural garbage.  I certainly don't expect you to think the same way! :-)  Anyway, my experience as a sort of long-term newbie is that our lot tend to de-emphasise the intellectual.  This is not to say that they are anti-intellectual (there's a lot of Zen literature being read and thought about) just that what they are after cannot be grasped purely intellectually, so the claim goes.  It's great to read books – here have some more – but my current IANAZM understanding is that if you  want to know what it's about, you have to practice.  Also with my group, the notion of being one's own teacher is probably slightly frowned upon.  A teacher is useful to crush some of those false positives you may conjure for yourself, Zen being so easy to misconstrue, so easy to think you've ""got"".  They also tend not to ""teach"", mostly sit, mostly dedicate themselves to making sure people are sitting with a good healthy posture and ever striving, always making their best effort in ceremonies and stuff.  There's a sort of sincerity to this that I find very appealing.  But, I don't want to push you one way or the other, just sharing my experience. Good luck!  I can rattle off some books if you want.  (Oh yeah, and I don't think folks in our group are very keen on Alan Watts)",™

The passive definition-theorem-proof style lecture probably won't work (since it doesn't work all that well in first year mathematics courses, the listener must already know that what they're listening to is interesting), so be sure to include many questions of the class of where to go next, collective examples, and follow up exercises: both ones requiring proof and ones requiring a computation (if possible, if not some comprehension checking true/false). Mark the exercises, this will probably be the students' first exposure to proof so be gentle. Find a few more common misconceptions (if you don't find any, good job, you have won maths education; that or your exercises were too easy for the class) and bring them up with the class (anonymously) and see if they can figure out why they're not strong enough statements to be proof.  Have goals for their understanding, set them high but ranging.

t5_2qh1i,PlatonicTroglodyte,1315421324,"I think most of us answering here are Athiests or Agnostics, but for clarification, I, too, am an Athiest.  My answer to the creation conundrum is a belief in the overwhelming force of balance. I wouldn’t say that I consider “Balance” to be a supernatural force, but merely a fundamental order that relates all things. While there is no evidence I find convincing for the existence of a higher power, I do see an abundance of evidence that all things eventually work out an equilibrium. From the Hindu concept of karma to the Daoist concept of yin yang, from Hegelian Dialectics to Newton’s third law, we humans have noticed an inherent desire in all things to reach a state of equilibrium with nature. These things have been noticed and widely accepted in religion, science, and philosophy, implying a widespread, albeit often subconscious, belief in such a system.  Now, how do I fit balance in the creation of the universe? Well it’s a bit too complicated for me to fit into words but I’ll see how well I can do with the sparknotes. Most of the people who have an issue around the Big Bang Theory are troubled with the ‘ignition’ part. Who or what started it? For me, I use suns as a model similar to this. For those of you who have never taken a course in Astronomy, suns are supported by a delicate balance (of course ☺) between gravitational pull and thermal pressure. The suns enormous mass naturally pulls in its own outer gases through gravity, but as it does so, the sun becomes more dense and the molecules heat up, and the resulting thermal pressure causes the gases to push away from the core. If we accept the unfathomable temperatures of the Big Bang, and that the rate of the universe’s expansion is slowing and objects are cooling, it is somewhat conceivable that all objects will eventually cool off enough to lose their outward momentum from intense thermal pressure and begin falling back into the universal center of gravity at the location of the last big bang. Once that happens and all matter again shoved into an incomprehensible dot, the molecules superheat and explode all over again, thus restarting the process.   There is no reason to suggest that we are in the first explosion nor the last. We forget that time is a human institution created to help facilitate our understanding, but sometimes, when you think about it, your mind can slip into a state where you can see everything as always happening constantly, and are not left to struggle with the impossible riddles of what came first and what comes next.

Strong expression of EGFR is common in lung cancer, and the EGFR gene is somatically mutated in a subset of tumors [55] and [56]. Thus, blockade of EGF, the ligand of EGFR, could affect tumor development. A human recombinant EGF-based vaccine has been developed (CIMAvax®), which is administered together with an immunoadjuvant [57], [58] and [59]. In a phase II study, 80 patients with stage IIIB or IV NSCLC who had completed first-line chemotherapy were randomized to receive best supportive care (BSC) or EGF vaccine therapy [58]. Each vaccine dose contained 50 μg equivalents of EGF and patients received the vaccine on days 1, 7, 14, 28 and monthly thereafter. Serum EGF concentrations were reduced in 64.3% of patients who received the vaccine, confirming that vaccination had provoked an immune-mediated decrease in circulating EGF. There was also a non-significant trend towards increased survival for vaccinated patients (n = 37) versus controls (n = 37), with median survival times of 6.47 and 5.33 months, respectively (p = 0.098). A clinically meaningful difference in survival was observed in vaccinated patients ≤60 years (n = 22) versus controls (n = 28), with median survivals of 11.57 and 5.33 months, respectively (p = 0.0124). No difference in survival was observed between vaccinated patients (n = 15) and controls (n = 9) aged &gt;60 years (p = 0.4382). Currently this vaccine is licensed in Cuba for use in adult patients with stage IIIB/IV NSCLC and approved for clinical trial development in the US. In addition a phase II/III trial is ongoing in Malaysia to assess the safety, immunogenicity and efficacy of the vaccine in patients with stage IIIB or IV NSCLC after conventional first-line chemotherapy [60]. The primary endpoint is overall survival.",®

t5_2shke,omegazero,1315499715,"**TL;DR: Probably can't make money with robotics.** &gt;""Does anyone recommend any books that describe how previous robotics startups formed and became rich?""  Name one major robotics corporation other than iRobot and Willow Garage that deal exclusively with robotics. Most are just research companies that professors started and they are NOT rich. They just get to play with interesting hardware.  iRobot? They built a platform that was hackable for hobbyists and provided a very real, consumer, function (vacuuming) as well as landing some government contracts early on. Willow Garage? [Look at their team](http://www.willowgarage.com/pages/about-us/leadership-team). They ALL have previous experience doing ridiculous things. TL;DR: Every one on that page has worked at highly respected places, e.g. Google, Yahoo, IBM, Stanford AI Lab. Robotics were NOT their first endeavor. [Here's a timeline of iRobot's history](http://www.irobot.com/sp.cfm?pageid=203). ""iRobot wins DARPA contract to build a tactical mobile robot, leading to development of iRobot PackBot®."" That's where real money is if you don't go consumer-level. It has to be government. No one else really wants robots yet.  One does not ""fall"" into robotics. It's not easy, and without any idea of how to program microcontrollers, move memory, bit twiddle, etc you're way out of your depth and breadth. You might be able to do all the physics calculations and kinematic models, but that's half the problem: there are just models. Most of that stuff doesn't work the same way in the real world, and finding CS-specific solutions (as it's usually hardware or software problems - e.g. precision of floating points) is difficult without previous knowledge.  I don't mean to overly discourage you, but the field is lean and new. The people doing research in it have years upon years of experience developing at major companies and universities. You can get into it, but to make a product that will make money -- I mean, you're dealing with entire teams of top-tier developers and engineers. You know your PhD advisor? Imagine an entire team of that person. Then have those people work on a single project.  Now, if you just want to mess around with robots and do some interesting research, that's a different thing entirely. If the goal isn't profit, sure, there are a lot of open problems. But as for getting rich with robots - best of luck.  I suggest learning C/C++ first, be able to solve a bunch of problems on Project Euler (and I recommend this because a lot of robotics problems are computationally hard, but if you can develop an efficient algorithm it eliminates the problem), and buy [Intro To Algorithms by Cormen](http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-Thomas-H-Cormen/dp/0262033844).

t5_2qlqh,justinkramp,1315540727,"I work for Sprint and am a Product Ambassador for the Photon. Started using it a month or so ago. While I ♥ my Nexus S 4G and loathed giving it up for the Photon, I'm pleasantly surprised with how well the Photon performs.   There were some initial reports of slow 4G speeds, which I have experienced--slower than my Epic 4G or Nexus S 4G--but that should be taken care of in a patch.   As for display, I do notice vertical lines when the screen is powered off, but when it is on, the display is perfectly suitable. I don't think it is as rich as my Nexus S, but no real complaints. I find myself wishing it was brighter outdoors, but that could be the brightness settings I'm using.  Kickstand is great. :) Use it a lot. The camera button is handy but it takes a good 8 seconds for the camera app to load after launching via the button or the app shortcut.  Uhm..otherwise issues I've seen reported are intermittent random muting during phone calls (fixed in the last MR/software patch), random issues with 3G connections failing to reestablish after dropping a 4G connection (I've seen this a couple of times; flipping airplane mode on/off fixes it) and I've had one random power cycle. Otherwise, feels like a solid device and delivers a full day (~10 hours) of solid use.  It does have motoBLUR but I don't mind it. Some of the widgets are pretty handy like the social networking and photo cards.  edit: In terms of build quality, I really like the weight and feel of this device. The back cover is a soft-touch plastic that feels slightly rubberized, and the back cover snaps on tightly. I like it; but it is a more industrial feel. The Nexus S is super sleek and slim, which I prefer; this is a bit more manly.",♥

t5_2sml9,limetom,1315554261,"Why should they care?  English spelling is completely out of touch with linguistic reality. If you ask many English speakers how many vowels there are in English, the would likely tell you five: a e i o u. But, if you define a vowel as a minimally contrastive unit as linguists do, most English speakers have anywhere from 13 (like many speakers in Los Angeles) to 16 (like many speakers in New York City or New Orleans' Lower Ninth Ward).   For example, we spell ""their,"" ""there,"" and ""they're"" different, and they mean different things, but they are pronounced exactly the same. Conversely, ""sow"" (a female pig) and ""sow"" (to plant seeds) are spelled the same, but they mean entirely different things and are pronounced differently.  Further, what punishment is there? In academic or business writing, one is socially obliged to write ""correctly."" Note that writing really is quite distinct from speech in English. You will almost never hear an English speaker use ""whom"" out loud, but in writing some might use it. But in a casual setting--on Facebook, while text messaging, etc.--these social pressures do not exist aside from people who decry the slow decline of ""proper"" langauge--which has been going on at latest since people started writing.  But I think you're missing an important point: these are quite often *creative* uses of language. Here's some examples of real, anonymous Facebook posts:  &gt;‎!!!!! That place is so good!  That's a lot of exclamation points. But they're being used for a reason: to express excitement in a way that cannot usually be expressed in writing.   &gt; ♥ transitivity/intransitivity  This is from a linguistics grad student friend. They're using the resources available to express something in an intentionally cute way. You can express ""cuteness"" in spoken/signed language with body language and other extra-linguistic things, but in writing, you have to do something like this.  &gt;ummm... TENGO QUE BAILAR!!!! 踊りたーい！！！ I need to dance!!! ...yea.  Multilingual creativity here. The Spanish is all caps and has lots of exclamation points. The Japanese has a 「ー」 (a *choon*) where it doesn't belong and exclamation points. Same with the English. (I think this person's Facebook style matches their speech; it is endearing.)  Your value judgements and assumptions about what ""correct"" usage should be is making you miss interesting things that are going on.",♥

t5_2qpp6,Zarent,1315571545,"Why is it an issue that Zerg no longer has an instant way to -demolish- the Protoss deathball in a direct confrontation? In the current patch, Infestor/Broodlord has absolutely no answer from the Toss arsenal - the only reliable way to win against it is never engaging it in a straight fight, which kind of goes against the entire theme of both races. I know, I know, in BW the races sorted themselves out, but it's still incredibly frustrating to think about that way.  Roach/Hydra/Corruptor was doing -pretty- poorly versus the deathball before the infestor buff, but the fungal change is still big after the buff and nerf. It should help, at any rate.  Secondly, there's nothing in this patch that stopped the other two main uses of infestors - Stopping harassment and harassing like a motherfucker. Still, two fungals decimates an entire worker line. Still, one fungal makes it so that a harassment force is stuck in place and can't get out. Still - and this is very, very important, because it hasn't been nerfed at all - Infested Terrans are FREE units that can take down a nexus in a few seconds.  This -is- a large change for PvZ, but overall, it's just Blizzard attempting to reset the balance of the overall matchup which was broken. Zerg already has an incredibly high number of ways to very effectively harass Protoss (Infestor hitsquad, ling runbys, +2 baneling drops) while P can't do much in return (Mass blink stalkers is somewhat viable against late game Infestor/Broodlord but other than that, -maybe- warp prism Zealot harass?). The gameplay style of Z will change so that their swarm can't butt heads with our Big Strong™ in a straight fight while ALSO being able to beat the crap out of us economically and map control wise.   The only issue with this change is yeah, ZvT, Thor rushes are going to be phenominally bullshit. Fungals still help killing the SCVs so Infestors are still worthwhile, but it's another All-In that T gets this patch, which I'm always uncomfortable with.",™

Below I state some of the many REASONS for said re-hearing, plus all of my evidence the attorney general chicaneriesly forwarded to the Bar Association Grievance Committee for prosecution of felon gangster mafiotic negroidic the BLACK Frank Gulotta, a Gangster Judge, therefore unprosecutable. The blackish menial negroidic-in-apperance-and-demeanour felon vicious parroting puppet ex-district attorney Nassau County with NO private law experience, DETESTED by all factions, in spite of this SOLELY because of his many year secret gangsterization and crucifixion of ME, this negroidic low mafiotic deadly BLACK Frank Gulotta was then IMMEDIATELY and UNPRECEDENTEDLY and REPEATEDLY rapidly promoted in spite of TREMENDOUS opposition to the present position of second highest state judgeship SOLELY through Gangster Computer God manipulation!  As additional evidence; during the last week of my within mentioned month-long worse-than-a-farce nazi court criminal trial in Nassau County court 1958 were dwarfed at felon-gangster Parroting Puppet rectum-lapper sodomous judge William Solomons ball-of-fat felon slut wife. She, AS PLANNED, sat in the front row, repeatedly stripping her over clothes and completely pulling up her dress and slip and pulling aside her old-fashioned pink BLOOMERS in order to display her ANUS, her CUNT. She repeatedly gesticulated and whispered: ""I’ll give it to you to suck! FINISH HIM!"" Her husband dwarfed, the felon Gangster parroting puppet rectum-lapper judge William Solomon, flush-faced in repeated open sodomistic display stuck out his TONGUE, WIGGLING IT, chuckling to her! You hangmanrope Gangster felon Parroting Puppet scum-on-top playboys can watch my Frankenstein eyesight television PLAYBACK of this felonious lowly sodomistic display by the felon sodomous judge William Solomon and his lowly felon-slut wife during my trial in Nassau County Court.  After my worse-than-nazi-court criminal conviction and CRUCIFIXION, for years in poverty I suffered hopeless, jobless character-assassination and isolation in this low deadly niggertown. I was the repeat target-victim of this Gangster Government’s gangsterization and undetectable extermination attempts to Shut Me Up Forever With My Secrets. Then, in December 14:th 1965, I attempted to escape this worse mongrel Gangster Communist-country to return to the Slovenic-Polish land of my forefathers. Instead, in a Gangster-staged Parroting Puppet DEADLY CONSPIRACY, I was flown from Kennedy New York Airport AT NIGHT to a small, distant S:t Lawrence River estuary snowbound, small airport under the guise that I was in Warzaw, Poland. Immediately many many things proved this to me, including the two big white asbestos-shingled hangars with the large ""Brand-F Airways"" —signs on their sidewalls, in addition to the many blurted statements I solicited from the many CIA deadly GANGSTERS, the assassins of ME, the many many Parroting Puppets all around me. I DEMANDED an immediate flight back to Kennedy New York Airport, instead I was held captive ALL NIGHT, later in CHAINS. I refused both; all food and requests that I’d go to sleep. Then CIA GANGSTERS, pretending to be Polish police with NO identification BEAT ME BLOODILY! Later, while ""my"" return-trip 707 Boeing jet airliner was being serviced for ""my"" return trip, I quickly walked into the airplane and saw a CIA GANGSTER with a small electric hairdryer-type blower pumping DEADLY POISON NERVE-GAS SMOKE into SECRET COMPARTMENTS under the ashtrays in the arms of the chairs where later *I* was ordered to sit in the airplane full of CIA UNDERLINGS, ""passengers"", my assassins, who GIGGLED as they watched me dragged in chains by the airplane by the Gangster CIA Police Gangsters! These deadly Gangster CIA passengers, they PRESSED THE FRONTAL PANEL OF THE ASH TRAYS IN THE SEAT ARMS to release the DEADLY POISON NERVE GAS SMOKE! Indubitably, all of the others deadly CIA underling GANGSTERS upon this staged-return flight, they ALL had taken the TOP-SECRET POISON NERVE GAS ANTIDOTE PILL™, immuning them from the deadly poison nerve gas smoke! Deadly poison nerve gas smoke was sprayed at me from CIGARS, CIGARETTES and even from BALL-POINT PENS also from the WIG of a woman sitting next to me, even the Swiss cheese-type ice cubes were evaporating into poison nerve gas smoke in all of the ""free"" drinks! I got up and went to the rear of the airplane by the rear exit door with the large push-up handle; my Frankenstein Brain-Thoughts Broadcasting Radio disclosed my intentions IMMEDIATELY; the loud speaker screamed that the flight was over and that our airplane was already preparing to land at Kennedy New York Airport.  You hangmanrope sneak Gangster playboy scum-on-top KNOW these facts are true, not only from taking part in such undetectable exterminations, but also you chicaneries demented felon Parroting Puppet Gangsters can WATCH my Frankenstein Eyesight Televison playback of all these horrible terrifying deadly events!  When I returned home, Joseph I Dec, my only brother and deadly felon-murderer and assassin-spy agent against me for this Gangster Government, he beat me repeatedly, CURSING me that I was not exterminated by all of the poison nerve gas smoke and that I did the IMPOSSIBLE in that I kept awake for THREE DAYS and refused ALL FOOD, in order to prevent my SNEAK EXTERMINATION! In accordance with the completely Gangster Computer God concocted-and-manipulated statutory law, one of your Gangster Courts’ requisite duties is to AUTOMATICALLY re-hear my said appeal case because it has been brought to your attention, you hangmanrope Gangsters, that my ENTIRE LIFE was destroyed by you co-conspirators through the Gangster Government’s purgered and fabricated criminal conviction of me in order to fulfil the demands of your Communist God, the Worldwide Mad Deadly Gangster Computer God. You deadly Parroting Puppet felon Gangsters already know that I have been and AM an INNOCENT primary victim and target for DESTRUCTION and EXTERMINATION because I am a MENACE to your Gangster Computer God, and that I am worse than defenceless without the Gangster Protection and Control of the Gangster Frankenstein Earphone Radio. I stand ALONE against you demented deadly Gangster Parroting Puppets, namely this worse Gangster Communist Computer God controlled Gangster Government! Before I’m exterminated by you hangmanrope underlings, I DEMAND A REPLY!  October 21:st, 1976  Francis E Dec, esquire  ADDENDUM: I personally filed my maximum-conviction appeal brief in 1961 with the chief clerk of the US Supreme Court, Washington DC. The chief clerk, he knew me! He sneeringly grabbed my thick, strong homemade appeal brief and then he attempted to rip it up, in desperation the chief clerk of the US Supreme Court ripped of the cover of my appeal brief! Miracously, I stopped him without a deadly scene to me. Then, filing my ripped-appeal brief, the felon and another co-conspirator with the nine hangmanrope Gangster Judges, the chief clerk in cowardly fear in staccato speech and gesticulation, he confessed to me; ""Mr. Dec, everyone is in on this one against you, even the attorney general."" Namely Bobby Kennedy, younger than his very-young-brother Jack Kennedy, Kennedy then-president. The Kennedy Playboys little fat Bobby was a felon lowest chicanerious UNTOUCHABLE Parroting Puppet Gangster against WORSE-than-defenceless Mr. Francis E Dec, esquire!

t5_2qh1i,KaeXIII,1315594299,"This one time a few years back I was at a local mall in my area, just coming out of a Sears. This white trash looking gentleman (with the t-shirt-a-la-hundred-holes, extra grease, side of beer belly) starts talking to his equally annoying looking girlfriend, right at the bottom of the escalators. Me and some stranger were trying to get passed him, so the stranger in front of me said ""excuse me"", which is usually followed by a silent acknowledgement and stepping aside. He instead gave a classy ""fuck off"".  We're both riding the escalator up behind him (which gave us the privilege of smelling his glorious shit-musk vacuum) and when he got to the top, he just takes a step and then turns around, taking up 3/4's of the exiting space. When the stranger ahead of me inevitably finished his  ride all of 2 seconds later, he knew he was going to need to get by this ass hat, so again says ""Excus-"", but then gets cut off by the arm in his face, as Dr. Trash lays into him for even contemplating using manners in his presence. This guy flies backwards down the escalator, and I tried to stop him by transforming my vaguely muscular yet pudge-padded body into a safety net of flesh and sears fashion. There is an issue here however, in that the safety net is attached to and is riding the escalator upwards, so in about 2 more seconds both my SearsNet™ and Decked-in-the-kisser are on our way up to meet Señor Haymaker for tea. Blood tea.  When the three of us meet at the top it's a garbled mess of anger and rage from the trashy fellow who I guess took it personally that our escalator kept bringing us back up. He pulls the guy and tosses him to the floor rather violently, and I step off to the side before I tumble back down the Staircase of Infinity. The jolly looking barbarian grabs the other guy by the shoulder of his shirt, and then out of nowhere three security guards and one of their off-duty buddies grab each guy and drag them away. This is the part of the story where I tell you the stranger was black, so of course they began to apprehend both the Trailer King, and the stranger noire. I jump in and let the security guys know that the stranger had absolutely nothing to do with the altercation, just that he happened to be the best option to rage out on for the guy at the time, which they hesitantly accepted and let the guy go.  Then I went to get some New York Fries (drenched in gravy, cheese and green onions w/ bacon bits). It really hit the spot, but it made me a little too full.",™

I would have gone on to not invade any countries at all, but rather to use the immense global goodwill shown to the US directly after 911 to investigate, determine who did it, capture them with international assistance and put them on trial as *criminals*, instead of treating them as enemies.   I would have sent them to different Supermaxes around the USA for life and made certain that they could not contact the outside world with their propaganda. Instead of being treated as heroes that were tortured and illegally jailed at Guátanamo they would have been treated as what they were: criminals and nothing more.  - It would have cost maybe $500 Million dollars, which something less than one onehundreth a precent of what we have spent to date on the GWT™.   - It would have produced no blowback.   - It would have been a model for the international treatment of the criminals that kill people for political or religious purposes.    - It would have given the USA a justified place as the moral leader of the world",™

t5_2qlqq,nylee23,1315598484,"What you said before about being on ESPN all the time for fantasy news because Yahoo! experts aren't experts is exactly this.  Just because you don't like Yahoo's format or lack of video (personally I find video annoying) does not mean the advice they give is bad (which is exactly what you implied).  And regarding the low percentages, this is taken from that ranking site's FAQ:  &gt;What is PAY™ (Prediction Accuracy Yield)? PAY™ is our yardstick for measuring accuracy. It shows how much benefit the expert’s predictions provided on meaningful lineup decisions. Our system turns each expert’s cheat sheets into thousands of individual “who should I start/draft” recommendations. We then score whether the expert’s picks were correct and how beneficial the advice was, based on the net fantasy points obtained by choosing the right player. A 100% PAY™ means the expert selected the right player for every meaningful predicition. A “meaningful” prediction is one that is not unanimous among our experts. We do this so that we’re scoring advice that you realistically might seek out (not obvious advice like starting Chris Johnson over Donald Brown). This is why PAY™ percentages tend to be lower than what some people would expect.  &gt;Accurate football prognostication is hard. Just ask the billion dollar sports gambling industry if it’s easy to predict winners. In that industry, a 60% win rate is God-like. The experts we track spend a considerable amount of time researching, analyzing and keeping up with the latest news (a lot more time than I can spend!), so we believe they deserve a little more credit than they’re normally given. A small edge is all you need. You’ll notice that the PAY spreads between experts is not large. In fact, we suspect these numbers will grow closer over time as we collect more data. Using Poker as an analogy, the top players in the world have a small statistical advantage over average players but that small advantage yields them great returns. How many times have you lost your matchups over just a couple fantasy points? One more correct decision can be the difference between making or not making the playoffs!",™

If you suspect he's ingesting anything bad, regardless of where it came from, take care of him first. Different poisons do vastly varied things to animals, and some can slowly kill after just one good sized helping. We had a cat that got some lily in her one time and died more than 24 hours later. They might even be able to tell you what it was if you take a sample of poo/vomit and that could help narrow down the hunt.  As far as confirming your suspicions, if they won't talk to you then a hidden camera is your best bet. But before you do, slip a note under their door that you've SIGNED AND COPIED that states quite clearly that their son is not permitted to feed your dogs, ever, and by letting him do so they're aware that the police will be involved. For all they know, your dog has severe health problems. They should know their boundaries as neighbors whether innocent or guilty. And also, even if you do catch them on camera but still somehow can't prove it's anything other than innocent child's play, you can at least call the cops with a simple, ""Neighbors are giving my dog food after I told them not to, and now he's ill."" If you happen to get a pet loving cop, chances are you'll benefit from trying even if you don't have concrete proof of straight up poison.

t5_2qmg3,TrollyG-Yo,1315813356,"Okay, we'll break this down word by word for you in our ESPN Joke Review©.  So what was the original statement we're all discussing here?    &gt;HEY CHIEFS FANS, HALEY'S ALREADY COMPLAINING ABOUT THE SCORE BEING RUN UP THIS SUNDAY.  So why is this funny?  1) It's referencing Haley's past complaints when opponents have ""run up the score.""    After a bad loss to the Broncos last year he got snippy on the field with McDaniels.  This year against the Ravens, in pre-season, he similarly complained once again.  A lot of people at this time thought he was a little fucking nuts, because there's no such thing as running up scores in pre-season, it's all about practicing.  So this part is funny because it's referencing the past in order to make predictions about the future.  It's not as funny as the other parts, because this is more the ""set up"" to the joke.    2) It would mean the Bills would blow out the Chiefs.  Now, I wouldn't be surprised if these teams evenly split picks.  Half the (non-fan) people thought the Bills would win, the other half Chiefs.  But **no one** would have predicted the final score.  I'm sure most people thought it would be 17-24 or 21-10 or something.  This part is funny because of all the teams you think would blow-out Chiefs, *the Bills would not be one of them.*  3) Finally, it would also mean that Haley knew, four days in advance, that his team was going to lose, and lose badly.  And not just lose badly, but lose badly **to the Bills**.  I'm pretty sure most coaches expect their team to win.  Or if they're a realist they at least expect a close game.  This part is funny because it makes it seem like Haley is expecting to lose which is a juxtaposition of a typical coach's thoughts.    So in summation:  Aw fuck it I'm getting bored of this now.  I just thought it was funny that I predicted a blow-out is all.",©

Although you cannot argue against the conclusion that in their axiomatic system, the sentence ""God exists"" is a theorem, the justification of the axioms themselves is not a logical task.)  However, you can use your intuition ""it's so clear and obvious"" to argue that no modal system where ◻ is taken as the operator of proof should accept the schema ¬◻p → ◻¬p as a theorem. ",◻

t5_2qh68,chrunchy,1315851015,"It seems kinda coincidental that they forgot Canada on two separate occasions - first where there was ""no greater friend than Mexico"" and then where there was ""no greater ally than Britain.""  And - I'm not sure - but weren't those two separate speeches from the one they're talking about?  No, I don't think that they ""just forgot"" the one time, it's more like they ""just forgot"" for a full eight years.  The Britian comment, that's kinda understandable because they were sucking up to Tony Blair to get them into Iraq, and Blair was loving every second of it.  But the Mexico comment... it's as if GWB's staff had no concept of a northern border, and GWB himself could not see any error on their behalf.  It's descriptive of the willful ignorance to look at facts clearly and make decisions based on those facts, something that would make itself evident only in the final years of GWB's presidency with the economic collapse. Apparently, you can ignore a booming economy for six years before it crashes. If he had not gone into Iraq, had not cut taxes and had not started an unfunded prescription drug program, and had not allowed deregulated banks we would be in a much different place than we are today. Unfortunately, being a republican president with a republican controlled senate and congress, he was under immense pressure from his own party to play ball, and he wasn't the right man to defy his party. So the question is - was it the party or the man who is responsible for the trash legacy of the GWB presidency?  And - this is a really important point - what lessons can other governments take from the GWB era? I personally worry that the Harper Government™ is more than willing to neglect the lessons presented to us. From their ""unreported crime"" statistics, to the neutering of StatsCan, the ""not really Canadians"" that are stuck in foreign prisons, the G8/20 no-oversight slush fund spending, and the new crime and copyright legislation I can see that their style of governance is not fact-based but power-wielding and agenda-based politics, instead of serving the best interests of Canadians.

t5_2fwo,pbkobold,1315872023,"There's a reason that every other implementation of list comprehensions flattens the results. If you don't flatten the results then list comprehensions lose their compositionality. If you have two separate list manipulations that are expressed as reasonably complex comprehensions and you try to compose them in coffeescript, the second will barf because it's not expecting nested lists... and you then have to manually flatten the list yourself. In Haskell and Python, this Just Works™.  The second thing is that the mapcat (i.e. flatten) implementation is strictly more powerful than map comprehensions. Python comprehensions can be made to behave like coffeescript, but not vice versa.  If you really want to see this for yourself, learn enough haskell to start to play with monads—then implement the list monad yourself. Without the flattening, list comprehensions are not monadic. Being monadic yields huge benefits in terms of cleanly composing a solution to a problem—even in languages like python where there are no explicit monads.",™

t5_2qh2p,nnoo_way,1315904045,"&gt; Argument *ad populum*.  Incorrect application.  Fungible things like language *do* depend on consensus.  It's not like saying ""the Earth is flat because people believe it is""; it's like saying ""the word for this object is *rock*.""  &gt; how a single statement could, objectively, evince fallacious reasoning on the part of the speaker   I reason that you are not a human at all, but a tree frog who has learned to type.  &gt; I don't know how it could be any clearer.  You are VERY clear, that's not the issue.  The issue is that your personal definition of a particular concept differs from the prevailing definition of that concept.  The RationalWiki page *explicitly cites* the exact usage at hand in its explanation.  What you are talking about is closer to Moving The Goalposts, because for you, the triggering action is *changing* standards.  NTS is specifically about avoiding negative association through employing a rhetorical device.  This might be easier to see if we construct an example that meets your criteria but not NTS:  ""If something has property X, then I include it in group Y.""  ""This has property X.""  ""I don't count that because it also has property Z.  It must have property X *but not* property Z.""  NTS:  ""No *true* human being could do what Hitler did.  Hitler wasn't a human being, he was a monster.""  It is apparent to everyone that Hitler was, in fact, human; but the NTS tries to avoid taint by using something to exclude a member which does NOT in fact conflict with group membership.  Unlike the following example:  ""No TRUE Christian is an atheist.""  (Not a NTS because the criteria is actually correct, as we understand it.)  Now what you seem to be saying is that someone could have some wacky definition of Muslim that would make the OP's statement not a NTS; now the statement isn't *wrong*, because the claimant is using a different definition from the start.  In order for this to apply, you're assuming that the OP was NOT talking about Muslims as everyone else understands them, but was instead talking about a personal definition which for all we know meant a *Jain*.    In that case, then YES, it wouldn't be a NTS, BUT -- here's the catch -- even if the statement were preceded by what you designated as the necessary and sufficient clause to complete a NTS, it STILL wouldn't be a NTS!  Because ANY of the words he used could be secretly redefined to mean something else.  Maybe ""Muslim"" means ""nebula"" and ""peace"" means SKITTLES® and who knows what else.  You'd have to nail down *every* definition of *every* term if you want to avoid possibly miscategorizing ANY individual's statements.  Once again, this falls into the domain of semantics.  If we are going to use language in such a way as to be able to communicate with one another, then we are assuming usage under prevailing definitions.  And in that case, the OP is using a NTS.  Otherwise the OP is talking nonsense like a jive turkey. ",®

t5_2qh1f,Chroko,1315916276,"Let's summarize your argument, shall we:  1. Windows is shit, because I have a locked-down desktop that I cannot fix and it requires daily reboots. 2. Windows is shit, because I had this laptop and it wasn't very good. 3. Windows is shit, because it can spawn processes that don't get killed when the parent exits. 4. OSX is ❤ MAGICAL ❤ and never has any problems!  Now let's go over those one-by-one:  1. If your work computer is unstable and your IT department won't fix it, they aren't very good. If you've got a leviathan app that just destroys your system - it's the application's fault, not Windows. There are badly-behaved applications that do this on all operating systems, including OSX. (Just try editing a big project in Final Cut Pro without occasionally needing to restart OSX.) 2. It's possible that the hardware retailer preloaded a bunch of stuff that you don't want/need - hence recommending a couple of apps to clean up the system (and as I've also pointed out in this thread, there are uninstallers and cleaners for Mac, so Windows is not unique.) Either way, it didn't sound like you really cared enough to try and fix your Windows machine. 3. This isn't a problem specific to Windows (which is why I said you were making shit up) - and there are badly-behaved applications on all systems. iTunes is one of them. mds/mdsworker is another legendarily buggy OSX background process. 4.

t5_2qhx4,peetee32,1315917025,"i drink one of these a day: http://www.coolgearinc.com/hydration3.html EZ-Freeze® Water bottle 75oz Big Freeze  there is a frozen insert that you put on the inside that is supposed to keep it cold...doesn't really work as well as i'd like.  if i cram it with ice then put the insert in it does keep icy longer.  its not insulated so it sweats like crazy, so i actually wrap one of those neoprene 'fat burning' bands aruond it like a giant koozie.  helps keep it cold and control the sweat.  i also have two of these: http://www.coolgearinc.com/hydration3.html EZ-Freeze® Water bottle 32oz Switchback  the insert in these block the water flow too much, so i don't use them.  i use the frozen inserts to keep my lunch bag cold though.  i have no complaints about the switchback.  its your basic pull top, squeeze and drink bottle.  they have been holding up very well.  use it 2-3xs a week at the gym.  the store i work at sells these types of bottles for $3-$4, which is why i bought them.  also have this narrow mouth nalgene: http://tinyurl.com/3v8bw2k the only thing i don't like is its a little TOO narrow to fit my ice cubes in.  i have to sort of smash the cubes with my hand to get some of them to fit...and i dont' always feel up to that task at 4:45am when im trying to leave for the gym.  if the mouth was a little wider, id probably buy a few more of these  FINALLY, we have several of these: http://tinyurl.com/43h749v which sadly, are not holding up very well, even though they are my favorite.  the cons are: the rubber gasket that seals he top when closed fell out on one, another one the top broke so it doesn't latch without the metal clip, and another one i dropped from about hip height onto concrete and it cracked to bottle.  the good part is i contacted thermos and they are going to send me some new parts to fix up the broken bottles.    but, if the thing isn't broken, these are awesome to use.  the top clicks down and seals the top.  a push putton flips the top back to reveal a perfect sized drink spout, then you just flip the top back and click it shut.  there is a metal clip that you can put on to keep it locked tight for travel.  the top unscrews for easy ice/water filling.  and it has a little loop for a caribiner.  so theres my water bottle review.

If whatever it comes up as looks the same as what libcaca has, then libcaca is doing the mapping correctly (cp437 0x01-&gt;Unicode codepoint 0x263A), but you don't like the particular Unicode font's approach to portraying that particular character.  You want a different font for your terminal, rather than a different terminal emulator; changing it to a font that looked like whatever the text mode on the graphics card that you once used had would give *you* the same effect, but not anyone else who ran your program in a terminal with different font settings.  Or you could do what you suggested above and go with SDL and write your own terminal layer and run as a graphical program -- Dwarf Fortress took this approach -- and *ensure* the look of the thing, but then you lose telnetability.  You can't, unfortunately, take a stock telnet connection and force the user at the other end to have a font that forces a particular appearance of a happy face, regardless of whether you're using utf-8 or cp437 encodings.  The character in each encoding just says ""gimme a happy face"", not ""gimme a happy face that looks like X, pixel-for-pixel"".  That's the font's job.  Hmm...well, maybe you could if you were using xterm...it [does support emulating some old graphical terminals](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/File:W3m-wikipedia.png), so as long as the telnet user is using a terminal type that supports graphics, you could push pixel-level graphics over the line.

Moving on....  ------  The Core: Stupidest fucking movie premise ever conceived by writers who were trying to be serious. The Earth's crust...it does not work that way, let alone the core itself.  2012: Neutrinos do not work that way. It's the same problem as The Core for bad writers trying to be serious while not knowing a damn thing about the subject they're writing about.  Pretty Woman: Because that situation is clearly going to end well.  Signs. The Sixth Sense. The Village... You know what? Let's just say that Shyamalam is one of the worst movie directors in history.  ---------  Pretty much any science fiction movie that involves space combat at less than 10,000 kilometers (especially close-quarters dogfighting). Star Wars, Star Trek (to an extent, if they multiplied their stated distances by a couple hundred/thousand, it would pass muster but....), Starship Troopers, etc.  Also, any science fiction movie that involves taking over a hostile planet or defending Earth from hostile aliens. There are billions upon billions of galaxies with billions upon billions of stars with billions upon billions of planets, PICK A DIFFERENT ONE, particularly one without an angry indigenous population. Starship Troopers is pretty horrifyingly bad for this: ""So, we're going to attack the 'home planet' of the Angry Bug Creatures™ with a ground invasion force...all the while ignoring that the entire 'Angry Bug Creature™ spore meteors' situation probably means they have THOUSANDS of worlds available to them already."" Similarly, humanity has developed to the point of interstellar travel...yet only lives on Earth and a handful of military outposts. *Riiiiiight.* (Yes, I am aware the movies are a bastardization of Heinlein's books but still...)

If an animation or cinematic shown during the start-up sequence runs longer than 20 seconds, it must be skippable using the START button or natural input.         For SONY  (applies to PS3 - disc, harddrive, patches and aditional content) &gt;[R181]  The title does not display blank, suspended, or unresponsive screens for longer than 15 seconds. Explanation: − A ""blank screen"" is a state in which there are no visual/audio cues to indicate that there is a game in progress. − A ""suspended screen"" is a screen in which the displayed image does not change. − An ""unresponsive screen"" is a state in which there is no response to user operation. This does not include demonstrations, or movies and conversation scenes that are included as part of the game's narrative. Loading screens defined in R180 are also not included in the definition of an unresponsive screen. − This requirement excludes situations in which the disc drive or internal HDD is malfunctioning, or the disc is soiled or damaged. If a blank, suspended, or unresponsive screen is shown for a long time for these reasons, this is not considered to be a violation of this requirement. − If a blank, suspended, or unresponsive screen will be shown over 15 seconds and may cause the user to think that a hang occurred, contact SCE via the PlayStation®3 Developer Network website (https://ps3.scedev.net/) for possible acceleration tips.

Thirty two of the total death reports have been confirmed and 36 remain unconfirmed due to no identifiable patient information in the report such as a name and contact information to confirm the report. A death report is confirmed (verified) after a medical doctor reviews the report and any associated records. **In the 32 reports confirmed, there was no unusual pattern or clustering to the deaths that would suggest that they were caused by the vaccine and some reports indicated a cause of death unrelated to vaccination.**  So no, there have been no documented cases. &gt;it's only proven to be effective for 5 years - so giving it to someone long before they're likely to become sexually active is rather pointless.  Have you even bothered to look into how this immunization works?  It is given to girls at this age because that is when HPV provokes the strongest immune response.  It is when it works best and it's most effective when girls are statistically most likely to become sexually active.",®

What about if they tried to implement THIS nutty idea:  &gt; A senior government official with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has expressed great interest in a so-called safety bracelet that would serve as a stun device, similar to that of a police Taser®. According to this promotional video found at the Lamperd Less Lethal, Inc. website, the bracelet would be worn by all airline passengers (video also shown below). &gt; &gt;This bracelet would: &gt; &gt;• Take the place of an airline boarding pass &gt; &gt;• Contain personal information about the traveler &gt; &gt;• Be able to monitor the whereabouts of each passenger and his/her luggage &gt; &gt;• **Shock the wearer on command, completely immobilizing him/her for several minutes** &gt;  &gt;The Electronic ID Bracelet, as it’s referred to, would be worn by every traveler “until they disembark the flight at their destination.”  Yes, you read that correctly.

t5_2qh63,adelie42,1316029204,"&gt;Just learn to temper your expectations with respect to the system Paul has to work in.  As I have kind of mentioned elsewhere, given that he has been very consistent in his message for a long time, I don't think there is a lot of need to argue over ""interpretation"" of what he means. By contrast, I was a long time Obama supporter, but it didn't take long to realize that, as you seem to be saying to, many people take what he says very differently.  If Paul were to be elected, it could only be because enough people agree with him with a low margin for misunderstanding for what he means by what he says (of course, baring understanding of the subjects by such individuals). The differences he may try to make could be difficult and frustrating, but I don't think ""confusing"" would come so much into play. My faith in Obama waned as it seems everything he says / proposes is goal oriented and not approach oriented. I understand that ""that's just politics"", and it very well could be ""that's never going to change"", but I had hoped (or deluded myself into believing) that was the kind of Change™ we were meant to believe in.  In short, if it is possible, I think Paul's use of words with specific meaning that can't just be twisted into whatever people want to hear will be necessary IF that kind of change is going to come. If that isn't what people want, he won't be elected. I also see it as a reason why so many see him as ""un-electable"". If he were elected, I would see it as a signal, but not one to read into too much, but couldn't hurt to hope~~(TM)~~.",™

You make her chase you, because the excitement of having to work over a guy is more exciting and interesting to her than a guy throwing himself at her feet.  What often happens is that the Nice Guy™ mistakes being ""nice"" with being quiet, shy, timid, and non-confrontational. You can be a nice person and still be sociable, fun, confident, and assertive.  You can also be a nice person and have a spine.  No girl worth your time wants to spend time with someone who they can walk all over.  Be careful though, because there are girls who will tease you and *maybe* put out on the rare occasion so you can drive her around everywhere, bail her out when she's in trouble, and buy her stuff that she or her boyfriend can't afford.   With that being said, I know a lot of girls who are attracted to guys who *are* complete douchebags.  It's not because they're douchebags, but rather because they exemplify the other qualities that the girl is searching for in a partner. What often happens with those guys is that they score the girl for a night, a weekend, or maybe even a few months, but they struggle to maintain long and fruitful relationships because they have personal issues that eventually come to the forefront.  So at the end of the day, if you see a girl that catches your eye, just talk to her.  Make sure you've got something interesting to say and that you can carry a conversation.  If she's not doing her part to converse and comes across as frosty or rude, just leave her be.  If she drops the ""my boyfriend bla bla bla"" or ""my husband bla bla bla"" you can either find an exit strategy or just be friendly and finish the conversation. ",™

t5_2qh1i,putonasmile,1316047277,"From the other side’s perspective…… Personally, I don’t find your girlfriend’s request to be uncommon or unnecessary.  Firstly, and most importantly, because it is a VERY STRONG religious motivation.  Secondly, it’s reassuring for a girl to know that your relationship is NOT built off of physical lust, but rather true attraction to the heart and soul.  If you are getting this worked up over the fact that you can’t have sex with the girl you ‘love’, then maybe your relationship was previously built solely off of sex.  In my humble opinion, that in itself would be a good motivation to re-prioritize the reasons why you love her.   Also, be careful not to be sidetracked by the comment attacks on your gf right now.  Just because she is convicted in her religious beliefs does not prove she will be ‘crazy’ and ‘emotionally unstable’ in your future.  I also practice abstinence in my relationship (2+ years now, with a non-religious man- if he loves you, he loves YOU) and I don’t think that in any way impacts my personality or sanity….    Also, on a sidenote: depending on how old and mature you both are, there is no reason why a year of dating ISNT enough to understand that this is the girl you want to marry.  I know plenty of extremely successful couples who have gotten engaged after just a few months ☺   oh, and FYI comments I agree with is that you should NOT fake yourself, so if you can’t handle conflicting belief systems- THEN it is a very good reason in this situation to walk away.

We'll let you know when the leaderboard is updated. In the meantime, we revised our [summary page](http://www.fantasypros.com/2011-fantasypros-forum-challenge/) for this contest so you can get a feel for what the scoring will be changing to. The explanation there is pretty detailed so for those who don't want to dive that deep I think the main takeaways are right up front:   &gt;* Every member’s vote counts. The more people (% wise) that pick the right player, the higher the score of the group. * We are measuring each group’s ability to create an optimal ""lineup"" (given the match-ups). A 100% PAY™ is a perfect score and means that every single member of a group picked the correct player. * The relative importance of each decision is baked into the scoring. We look at the spread in fantasy points for each set of players in a match-up. Match-ups with larger point spreads are deemed to be more important decisions given the opportunity cost of making the wrong choice. Those predictions, therefore, carry more weight.  ",™

Time	 Sunday at 10:00pm - September 19 at 2:00am  Location	 Re-Bar  Created By	 Flammable Sundays, Sunshine Jones, Peter Evans  More Info	 Sunshine Jones is one half of the legendary house music duo Dubtribe Sound System. Formed in the warehouse movement of San Francisco, the tour de force began releasing music in the early 90s. Dubtribe's first single, Mother Earth, was frequently quoted as being a major influence of The Chemical Brothers and many other breakbeat producers of the 1990s. Since that time, Dubtribe Sound System has released six albums, including the critically acclaimed Bryant Street (Imperial DUB, 1999) and Baggage (Defected Records, 2003).  Post-Dubtribe, Sunshine hasn't skipped a beat. He's been writing and recording music and vocals non-stop, including his highly acclaimed King Street debut titled Seven Tracks in Seven Days. Sunshine performs live every week on his program Sunday Soul, which attracts thousands of listeners to his 90hz.org internet radio community. In addition to his passion for sharing music, Sunshine is a poet, author, lover, father, and graphic designer.  Several Dubtribe jams have been anthems here on the Flammable dance-floor thorough out the years, but the most seminal and emotive of them all has to be the timeless masterpiece ""Do It Now""... It will be a treat... and a sentimental journey for many of us to witness it performed live by Sunshine on this important evening.  We hope you can make it! :) ♥ Flammable Crew.  http://sundaysoul.com/ http://sunshine-jones.com/ http://www.kingstreetsounds.com/sunshinejones/ http://www.discogs.com/artist/Sunshine+Jones http://90hz.org/",♥
t5_2qh03,Neo991lb,1316112589,"&gt; Seriously, why do more people not use projectors instead of TVs?  Right now I have an 80"" 16:9 screen. To get this image, you have to have at least 8 or so feet from the projector to the screen, even more as it goes up (example: I'm moving, replacing the screen with about a 130"" or so screen, maybe a little bigger- I need at least 14 feet from projector to screen, not everyone has this). Besides that, you'll usually need VERY good light control to get an image that isn't washed out, especially with lower-end (meaning &lt; $2000) projectors. This isn't a problem at all with TVs, except for maybe glare issues. On top of THAT, you need to mount your projector (perfectly level) to the ceiling, mount your screen to the wall, set everything up.. It's just a much bigger hassle than buying a TV, much more effort and thought is put into it and it takes a bit more know-how.  Plus, with this system you'll want a sound system (5.1 setup at least), since the projector's speakers, if they even have any, are NOT going to cut it. People just don't have the room and the perfect circumstances to justify using a projector based system.  You can either game with a TV (sound system optional), or a projector, in which case you need:  * Projector (mounted perfectly level at the right distance from the screen) * A light controlled room that is at least a 12-14 foot long, which many people don't have\* * Screen, or wall painted white (preferably with special screen-paint) * Sound system, at least 5.1 * An HDMI cable run from your inputs or receiver to the projector, which could be a 35+ foot run of HDMI cable (cheap with Monoprice™ but unless you run it in the wall, it's ugly)  \* ALSO, projector based entertainment systems are a bit gaudy, are pretty out of place in the living room as they are kinda tacky in a common area, in my opinion. I would shy away from it personally, so you also probably want a dedicated theater room, which not many people have in their house and definitely not in their apartment. I guess you could use a spare bedroom but it would probably need to be at least 12 feet long, most people's bedrooms besides the master are like 10 or 11 feet, not 12+.",™

Sure, some people may be hysterics, but the tested sufferer was able to detect 90 % of the time that the RF was present, and when it was not, and that is scientifically significant. I want to read any paper they wrote on the results, though, and it needs to be repeated by different testing parties in order to confirm reliability.

Several of our early statesmen were willing to deal with a more conciliatory Britain (primarily in trade). Furthermore, there were a quite a few disagreements that happened between the United States and France.    Some examples:   *After the American Revolution, Washington promoted a policy of neutrality while we regrouped and rebuilt. A [French ambassador](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen_Genet) risked that neutrality by raising an army of American mercenaries and taking them raiding.    *As our support in France originated with the upper class, we didn't immediately side with the French revolutionaries. This perceived betrayal resulted in the counter-insult of the [XYZ Affair.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XYZ_Affair)  *While the Louisiana Purchase added a tremendous amount of territory, Napoleon [couldn't make use of it anyway](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lousiana_Purchase#Negotiation). He likely would have also known that New Orleans and the Mississippi had become critical to the United States, and that Jefferson was willing to go to war for both.  *While we decried European imperialism, we insisted that we had [sole claim to the Americas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monroe_doctrine).

Canon Dr. Bill Prentice, director of Community Ministry for the Anglican diocese of Ottawa, said: ""We forget our history.""  &gt;He pointed out that the the empire, autobahns, and many labour programs in Germany ere founded by Nazi institutions.  &gt;© Copyright (c) The Nuremberg Citizen  To be more constructive, the idea that we shouldn't get hung up on the horrors of something because of the good things that came with is an abominable suggestion.",©

t5_2cneq,nnoo_way,1316214374,"&gt; It is ruling with consent of the majority  Where is the proof that this is the ""right"" way to do things?  It sounds like an axiomatic assumption.  It seems to me that the ""right"" way can *only* be determined, to whatever imperfect degree, by looking at *consequences*.  For example, if 51% vote for a policy that causes X amount of net harm, while 49% vote for a policy that causes 1/2 X amount of harm.  To give a real example, the OFFICIAL disenfranchisement of African-Americans until relatively recently.  Democracy can't be said to ""work"" if you keep having to keep it in line by overruling the popular vote on KEY issues repeatedly.  Rights for black people?  No way.  Rights for gay people?  No way.  Rights for workers?  Women?  The poor?  The middle-class?  Individuals?  And once you start overruling for GOOD, you've set the precedent, and they start overruling for BAD purposes...    ""Medical Marijuana!  We all voted!!  80% of people want it legalized!""  Government:  No.   &gt; You are deliberately misunderstanding me.  Not at all.  I am trying to understand what seems to be a mismatch between popular sentiment (""yay Democracy!"", everyone is taught to love it) and how things work in practice.  Just look at a Normal Distribution (bell curve) of the populace on whatever metric: Intelligence; or Critical Thinking skills ; Compassion ; or what-have you.  Then consider where you have to be on the curve to AVOID the *manufacturing of consent* by corporate media and society.  If you cut it right down the middle, HALF the people are below average.  They only need to get ONE GUY on the other side of the line and they have a majority.  &gt; Your solution is what?  I believe I mentioned that in my very first response.

I guess that you are talking about ionophores:  &gt;Ionophores are feed additives used in cattle to increase feed efficiency and rate of gain. Ionophores when used as a part of feeding management can be an excellent way not only to increase production of animals, but also be a very effective way to make cattle more valuable from a cost of input standpoint. Some examples of ionophores are: monensin (Rumenson ®), lasalocid (Bovatec®), and laidlomycin (Cattlyst ®).   BTW - Ionophores were originally developed as coccidiostats for poultry. A coccidiostat is an antiprotozoal agent that acts upon Coccidia parasites.

t5_2qhn3,Billy_Reuben,1316218329,"From your link:  &gt; Of the total number of VAERS reports following Gardasil®, 92% were considered to be non-serious, and 8% were considered serious. The vast majority (92%) of the adverse events reports following Gardasil®  vaccination have included fainting, pain, and swelling at the injection site (the arm), headache, nausea, and fever. Syncope (fainting) is common after injections and vaccinations, especially in adolescents.  That was out of 35 *million* vaccines given.  Also, you're 100% wrong in saying:  &gt;1-2 out of every 100,000 people get Guillian -Barr Syndrome from this vax.  It's actually explained in the link you provided for me:  &gt;Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) has been reported after vaccination with Gardasil® . GBS is a rare neurologic disorder that causes muscle weakness. It occurs in 1-2 out of every 100,000 people in their teens. A number of infections have been associated with GBS. There has been no indication that Gardasil® increases the rate of GBS above the rate expected in the general population, whether or not they were vaccinated.  Here's some more facts about cervical cancer, from this more comprehensive review article:  http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/253513-overview#a0156  Among them:  &gt;The American Cancer Society estimated that in the United States in 2010, 12,200 new cases of cervical cancer would be diagnosed.[5] In addition, more than 50,000 cases of carcinoma in situ are diagnosed each year. Internationally, 500,000 new cases are diagnosed each year. Unlike the United States, where the annual incidence is 6.8 cases or less per 100,000 women, rates in parts of South America and Africa range as high as 52.8 cases per 100,000 women.  That is important, because of the treatments to cure *carcinoma in situ* such as LEEP, cone, and multiple revisions, can lead to cervical insufficiency and the inability to carry an infant to term without severe difficulty and further intervention. That's what happened to my sister after her boyfriend cheated on her when he went to college.  Your rates of death is also misleading, because it lets you completely ignore the *morbidity* of HPV associated carcinoma and cancer.",®

t5_2qh1i,PrincessSparkleslut,1316240692,"This is totally normal. As LordDavethe7th said - it's the grieving process. It could potentially take a very long time. Or not.   As a yoga teacher, and therefore someone who professionally teaches people how to deal with stress and emotions... I'll say this: Let the feelings come. Don't judge yourself for them. Just accept them. Sit with them a bit so they can be processed. If it becomes too much give yourself a little hug (or get one from someone else) and move on for a bit. Just remember to breathe in long deep breaths. Making your exhales longer than your inhales calms the nervous system and therefore has a relaxing effect.  As someone who has been through the grieving process... let me say that some days are just going to be fucking hard. You have to allow yourself to grieve so it's a good thing that you are, but try to also remember/focus on the good memories enough that the sad ones aren't all you have going on. Sudden death can cause a complicated grieving process. Therefore it can be a little harder and last a little longer than usual. Keep in mind that it will get better... but it won't happen overnight. Talk to someone about it - friends, family, or a professional. Even if it doesn't feel like it - it can help to mull it over out loud. Just as you helped others - allow yourself to be helped too. But for someone to help you - they have to know you're hurting, so don't keep it a secret.  Grieve as long as it takes. Lots of Hugs ♥",♥

t5_2qh2p,brettalan,1316280305,"CONTINUED:  Figure 3. A molecule will take multiple paths in the double-slit experiment. Later in the book, Hawking describes how Einstein’s theories imply the unification of space and time. When the universe was small enough for quantum theory to apply, it was also massive enough for relativity to apply. Under these extreme conditions, space-time is warped so much that “time behaves like another dimension of space”. People often ask, “What came before the Big Bang?” It appears that there may not have been a “before”. At the very beginning, time did not exist as we know it. Human experience does not apply to the very early universe. Our usual perceptions aren’t consistent with the reality of such extreme circumstances. Hawking makes a comparison that makes the concept easier to understand. Asking what came before the Big Bang is like asking what is south of the South Pole. There is nothing south of the South Pole because there no south at this point. Likewise, there is no before the Big Bang, because there is no time before it. Now the part about quantum theory begins to apply to the Big Bang. Recall that at a quantum level, a particle will take all possible paths, only choosing one when it is observed. Applying this logic to the early, tiny universe began in every possible way. This would mean that an infinite number of universes exist. This is called the multiverse concept. Different universes would have different physical laws. This would explain why our universe formed the way it did. It would be one of an infinite number. Of course, we live in a universe hospitable to life. We would never have evolved otherwise.	 Dr. Krauss has presented his own thoughts on why the universe came to be. In a lecture he gave, he discussed the formation of the universe and why it is here. [5] Krauss tells how he tried to find the shape of the universe, so he could know how it might end. When we look at how the universe ends, we also learn about its beginning. Everything depends heavily on the shape of the universe. There are three possibilities. If there is enough mass in the universe, space-time will curve into itself, closing the universe (This would eventually cause the universe to collapse back into itself). If there is less mass then the critical amount, the universe is open (And ends by tearing itself apart, because of Dark Energy). Krauss’s hypothesis is that the universe must be flat, because if so, the negative energy causes by gravity will be exactly equal in magnitude to the positive energy (of the matter and energy) in the universe. This would make the total amount of energy in the universe zero. This would mean that if you were to add up everything that exists in our universe, you would get nothing. A flat universe is the only one that can come from nothing. If the universe is indeed flat, its existence makes perfect sense.    Firgure 4. Possible shapes of the universe.Ω represents the ratio of actual mass to the amount it would take to make the universe flat. How does Krauss’s hypothesis stand up against scientific testing? Well, it turns out, quite well. He describes how it appears that gravity in galaxies is much stronger than it should be. Scientists have inferred that some mysterious matter causes this gravitational effect. It is called “dark matter”. If you add all the dark matter and the kind of matter we are familiar with together, you’ll get a value that is about 30% of what it would take for the universe to be flat. At first, one might think Krauss was wrong, but it turns out, there is something else that needs to be taken into account. While, conventional logic tells us the universe’s rate of expansion should be slowing down due to the force of gravity, it’s actually speeding up. The force causing this acceleration has been dubbed “dark energy”. Dark matter and dark energy are very mysterious. Quite frankly, scientists have no idea what they really are, and yet they make up about 95% of the known universe. Despite the mystery of these things, they have been measured. If you take the amount of dark energy that would account for the universe’s accelerating expansion and add it to the matter (dark and otherwise), you’ll get just the right amount of total energy to make the universe flat. 	 There is even more evidence for a flat universe. Krauss also describes how the universe’s geometric has actually been measured directly. By placing a large triangle on the surface of the earth, we can measure its geometry. Because the earth is a curved surface, the angles of the triangle will be enlarged, and add up to more than 180°. This same principle works with the three dimensional universe. Recall how the cosmic microwave background radiation is full of nonconformities, or “lumps”. In a closed universe, the light from these galaxies would have been distorted in such a way that the lumps would look bigger then they do. In an open universe, the lumps would look smaller. The size of these lumps is consistent with Krauss’s hypothesis. The universe is flat. 	An age old philosophical question is, “Why is there something rather than nothing?” Dr. Krauss attempts to give an answer based on physics in this lecture. Early on, he shows an animation of the empty space inside a proton. It shows how “virtual particles” seem to come in and out of existence. As I’ve said earlier, quantum physics is really weird. These quantum fluctuations occur where there is “nothing” as we understand it. “Nothing” is inherently unstable. Given that the total of everything in the universe is essentially nothing, it actually makes sense that “something” can come from “nothing”. With quantum fluctuations, it is unavoidable. Given nothing, you get a universe. 	Yet another model of the universe is the Cyclic model. It seems similar to an idea of an oscillating universe, which now seems unlikely, since the universe is probably flat and space-time will not curve back into itself. In the Steinhart-Turok model, dark energy accelerates the universe’s expansion for trillions of years, until other factors far beyond the scope of this paper (having to do with M-theory) bring the acceleration to a halt, followed by a universal collapse. After this, there will be a moment of stability, followed by another Big Bang. The mathematics behind this model would explain dark energy, according to the physicists behind the theory. With the cyclic model, there is no beginning of time. The universe is eternal and goes through endless cycles. [8] There are of course, problems with this theory. It relies heavily on M-theory, which is not well understood. 	Since this beginning of the last century, science has learned much about the universe we live in. We now understand that it began, at least in its current form, around 13.7 billion years ago, and has been expanding ever since. There is a consensus that this happened and a good explanation, with an abundance of supporting evidence, of how it happened. What may be much more intriguing, is why it happened. Many scientists think it was unavoidable, but for different reasons. Proponents of M-theory would say that it had to have happened because string theory causes all possible universes to form. Others believe that it was inevitable because “nothing” is physically unstable and must produce a flat universe, such as ours. While Hawking believes that time itself began to exist at the moment of the Big Bang, so there is no “before”, Steinhardt and Turok think that the universe goes through cycles lasting trillions of years, but it ultimately infinite in age. Many people still want to know exactly how and why the universe exists. Unfortunately, there are many conflicting ideas. Perhaps in the next few generations, a unifying theory that perfectly explains this issue will be developed. The answer to the questions posed today may seem obvious to the people of the future, but as of April 19, 2011, no one can be completely sure. Despite how much has been learned, the unknown is still vastly greater than the known. For the time being, the origin of the universe remains shrouded in controversy and mystery. References  1.

t5_2qil9,zenprowler,1316456900,"First off, ship spinning. The ability to see your current ship within the station hangar. This was removed when we released Captain‘s Quarters, as we felt the perspective from your own bridge overlooking the ship was enough. As it turns out, it didn‘t allow you to look at the ship from all angles, it requires far more GPU and CPU power than simply rendering a ship and a hangar and, importantly, we didn‘t retain UI functionality such as drag-dropping a ship onto your hangar to activate it or double-clicking on the ship to open its cargo. We know that it‘s annoying as hell logging into a station on a craptop trying to sort out some market orders and feel it slowly roasting your lap while it renders your pencil skirt-wearing Caldari commander lady. We are addressing this now.  The original UI functionality is scheduled to be retained. Rather than a checkbox in the escape menu, you will simply be able to board and unboard your ship, toggling between Captain‘s Quarters and Ship Spinning mode. Your client will remember your last choice, so if you left your station while boarded, you will be boarded the next time you find yourself in a station and vice versa. Expect it on the test server soon™.  Second, while introducing the new turret graphics, we decided to experiment with using rendered views of each turret to replace the icons that you see in the fitting screen, HUD, market and on active targets. It turned out that the new turret models, while heavily detailed and cool, didn‘t lend themselves well to being drawn in an area just a few pixels wide and tall. Usability suffered. It was hard to distinguish between turret types. As a result, we will be reverting the change so that turret icons use the original custom drawn icons, rather than 3d renders of the turrets themselves. You will still be able to get the 3d preview of the turret, to celebrate their uberness while reading their stats.  Third, we‘ve made a number of improvements on the skin shader and on shading within the Captain‘s Quarters in general.:      * Fixed the incorrect specular behavior     * Fixed shader texture gamma issues     * Implemented a new specular glossiness model     * The specular reflection is tinted by the color of the light     * Added diffuse and specular fresnel     * Added specular light from indirect light (spherical harmonics)     * Calibrated the BRDF presets to the ones in character creator ",™

The more familiar ones attribute changes of climate to Olympian forces that range from geological upheavals and dust-belching volcanoes to long-term variations in the radiation of the sun and eccentricities in the orbit of the earth. Only the so-called carbon dioxide theory takes account of the possibility that human activities may have some effect on climate. This theory suggests that in the present century man is unwittingly raising the temperature of the earth by his industrial and agricultural activities.  When you talk about Climate Change™, you're talking about the political framing of the scientific debate. If you're going to do that, you need to read up on how [Frank Luntz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Luntz#Global_warming), an communications advisor to the Bush administration, recommended that the language be changed so as to make the issue appear less severe.

Damn near a 5th of Jim Beam white label (alot for a 15 year old)... Pass out, wake up at 7am in my own shower, flooding out. My brother/parents tell me the story goes a little something like this.  After getting more than slightly inebriated I decided I wanted to go home. In my glorious childhood wisdom I decided I was too drunk to drive home with my learners permit so I borrowed (stole while he was asleep) my friends GRANDMOTHERS bike that was straight out of the 1950's.  I then proceeded on my 6 mile journey... I make it 3 miles to the middle of my one stoplight town before the only cop in town(which I give spare ribs to at the end of the night when closing up where I work) stops me, notices how completely and utterly screwed up I am. He puts me in the back of the car and takes me home, with the bike in the trunk. He wakes my mom up and tells her what I was up to and leaves. I then proceed to get naked and run around the house screaming at my brother(3 years older than me, 18). Brother has enough. Hits me once and lays my ass out... When I come to seconds later I decide I didn't want any of that shit and hopped in the shower to 'sober' up. They went to sleep.  Now... back to the main point.... I wake up sitting indian style in the tub with my head over the edge on my arms, unfortunately the heal of my foot was plugging the drain and water was pouring over the side. I JUMPED UP. water went down because my body was no longer in it so I let out a very stupid sigh of relief. After I got out and toweled off I realized there was about a quarter inch of water in the bathroom (tiled) floor. I knocked all the towels into the floor and grunted something else stupid... ""atleast its not much, the carpet probably soaked up alittle right outside the bathroom""....  Now I've got a towel around me and I'm ready to start my journey again. As I take my first step outside of the bathroom the gravity of the situation started weighing on me. *Squish*... StupidBRO™ then says to himself ""Ok thats bad, hopefully it didn't go far..."" So I kept walking. Atleast a quarter inch of water was soaked through the entire floor in my house. Luckily there was is no basement in that house. Water was actively dripping through the carpet out of the front door over 30 feet from the bathroom.  And thats how my parents claimed flood damage and got new hardwood floors and I obtained the limp I still have today. Also. That was the last time I ever drank whiskey! Sadly, it wasn't the last time I got inebriated though.  TL/DR; I sit down with the shower running drunk and flooded the house.",™

The IP address of the library will be embedded in the e-mail headers, and anyone with a decent amount of computer skills could look at the message source and see it.  ♦ DO NOT send an e-mail from the library's wifi, as they frequently keep logs which can be subpoenaed, unless you know how to forge your MAC address (this is trivial to do in Linux, more difficult with Windows, reply to this post if you want to know how).  ♦ DO use the wifi at a coffee shop or somewhere where you are confident they do not keep logs.  ♦ For extra security, DO use a proxy server in a country which won't respond to a subpoena; register the e-mail account and send the e-mail with the proxy server.  DO NOT use a connection that could be traced back to you to connect to the account.  ♦ DO delete all of your browser history after you do this (this is obvious, but some people aren't tech savvy).  If you want to be extra paranoid, you can use a bootable flash drive which won't save anything.   Any other questions you have you can PM me or reply to this post.

If they have had a long term quantifiable impact on the debate it sounds like it might be worth understanding better.  &gt;carbon dioxide theory takes account of the possibility that human activities may have some effect on climate.  ""some effect"" seems like a silly question as it purposes a null hypothesis that if disproven would mean effectively nothing. No action can be said with certainty to have no impact on anything. There is no known form of energy production that that has no impact on the climate. The better question is the significance, as a component of a complex adaptive system, of proof of we are critically disturbing a questionably sensitive environment. Once we put value on electricity, something the production of is going to importantly be impacted by any legislation, the science becomes a component of an economic question because it is all a comparison of value and risk.  I strongly believe that everything being the same, maximizing CO2 output proportionally to consumption of fossil fuels is ideal and would be in everybody's best interest. As a trade off it could arguably be more important than maximizing cal/mol of fuel consumption if pollutant / unit of productive output is minimized. For example, Motorcycles get very high mileage but are the worst polluters on a measure of pollution / unit of power (weight moved). I see a desperate need for the acceptance of the (possibly arguable) fact that CO2 is not a pollutant in most every significant way that matters. If there was still a debate after that, I would be much more interested in the debate.  &gt;When you talk about Climate Change™, you're talking about the political framing of the scientific debate.  Yes, a dirty window neither of us can deny we are stuck with having to look at everything through.  &gt;recommended that the language be changed so as to make the issue appear less severe.  hypothetically reasonable, but you have convinced me that it could be worth reading and understanding as an element of the debate. There is a big difference between changing language and, say, numbers.",™

t5_6,mason55,1316548646,"For the inevitable take down:   Yoga mat for sale. Used once at lunch hour class in December 2009. Usage timeline as follows:   11:45a Register for hot yoga class. Infinite wisdom tells me to commit to 5 class package and purchase a yoga mat. I pay $89.74. Money well spent, I smugly confirm to myself.   11:55a Open door to yoga room. A gush of hot dry air rushes through and past me. It smells of breath, sweat and hot. Take spot on floor in back of room next to cute blonde. We will date.   11:57a I feel the need to be as near to naked as possible. This is a problem because of the hot blonde to my left and our pending courtship. She will not be pleased to learn that I need to lose 30 pounds before I propose to her.   11:58a The shirt and sweats have to come off. I throw caution to the wind and decide to rely on my wit and conditioning to overcome any weight issues my fiancÃ©e may take issue with. This will take a lot of wit and conditioning.   11:59a Begin small talk with my bride to be. She pretends to ignore me but I know how she can be. I allow her to concentrate and stare straight ahead and continue to pretend that I don't exist. As we finish sharing our special moment, I am suddenly aware of a sweat moustache that has formed below my nose. This must be from the all the whispering between us.   12:00p Instructor enters the room and ascends her special podium at the front of the room. She is a slight, agitated Chinese woman. She introduces me to the class and everyone turns around to greet me just as I decide to aggressively adjust my penis and testes packed in my Under Armor. My bride is notably unfazed.   12:02p Since I do have experience with Hot Yoga (4 sessions just 5 short years ago) I fully consider that I may be so outstanding and skilled that my instructor may call me out and ask me to guide the class. My wife will look on with a sparkle in her eye. We will make love after class.   12:10p It is now up to 95 degrees in the room. We have been practicing deep breathing exercises for the last 8 minutes. This would not be a problem if we were all breathing actual, you know, oxygen. Instead, we are breathing each other's body odor, expelled carbon dioxide and other unmentionables. (Don't worry, I'll mention them later.)   12:26p It is now 100 degrees and I take notice of the humidity, which is hovering at about 90%. I feel the familiar adorning stare of my bride and decide to look back at her. She appears to be nauseated. I then realize that I forgot to brush my teeth prior to attending this class. We bond.   12:33p It is now 110 degrees and 95% humidity. I am now balancing on one leg with the other leg crossed over the other. My arms are intertwined and I am squatting. The last time I was in this position was 44 years ago in the womb, but I'm in this for the long haul. My wife looks slightly weathered dripping sweat and her eyeliner is streaming down her face. Well, ""for better or worse"" is what we committed to so we press on.   12:40p The overweight Hispanic man two spots over has sweat running down his legs. At least I think its sweat. He is holding every position and has not had a sip of water since we walked in. He is making me look bad and I hate him.   12:44p I consider that if anyone in this room farted that we would all certainly perish.  12:52p It is now 140 degrees and 100% humidity. I am covered from head to toe in sweat. There is not a square millimeter on my body that is not slippery and sweaty. I am so slimy that I feel like a sea lion or a maybe sea eel. Not even a bear trap could hold me. The sweat is stinging my eyeballs and I can no longer see.   12:55p This room stinks of asparagus, cloves, tuna and tacos. There is no food in the room. I realize that this is an amalgamation of the body odors of 30 people in a 140 degree room for the last 55 minutes. Seriously, enough with the asparagus, ok?   1:01p 140 degrees and 130% humidity. Look, bitch, I need my space here so don't get all pissy with me if I accidentally sprayed you with sweat as I flipped over. Seriously, is that where this relationship is going? Get over yourself. We need counseling and she needs to be medicated. Stat!  1:09p 150 degrees and cloudy. And hot. I can no longer move my limbs on my own. I have given up on attempting any of the commands this Chinese chick is yelling out at us. I will lay sedentary until the aid unit arrives. I will buy this building and then have it destroyed.  I lose consciousness.   1:15p I have a headache and my wife is being a selfish bitch. I can't really breathe. All I can think about is holding a cup worth of hot sand in my mouth. I cannot remember what an ice cube is and cannot remember what snow looks like. I consider that my only escape might be a crab walk across 15 bodies and then out of the room. I am paralyzed, and may never walk again so the whole crab walk thing is pretty much out.   1:17p I cannot move at all and cannot reach my water. Is breathing voluntary or involuntary? If it's voluntary, I am screwed. I stopped participating in the class 20 minutes ago. Hey, lady! I paid for this frickin class, ok?! You work for me! Stop yelling at everyone and just tell us a story or something. It's like juice and cracker time, ok?   1:20p It is now 165 degrees and moisture is dripping from the ceiling. The towel that I am laying on is no longer providing any wicking or drying properties. It is actually placing additional sweat on me as I touch it. My towel reeks. I cannot identify the smell but no way can it be from me. Did someone spray some stank on my towel or something?   1:30p Torture session is over. I wish hateful things upon the instructor. She graciously allows us to stay and 'cool down' in the room. It is 175 degrees. Who cools down in 175 degrees? A Komodo Dragon? My wife has left the room. Probably to throw up.   1:34p My opportunity to escape has arrived. I roll over to my stomach and press up to my knees. It is warmer as I rise up from ground level - probably by 15 degrees. So let's conservatively say it's 190. I muster my final energy and slowly rise. One foot in front of the other. One foot in front of the other. Towards the door. Towards the door.   1:37p The temperature in the lobby is 72 degrees. Both nipples stiffen to diamond strength and my penis begins to retract into my abdomen from the 100 degree temp swing. I can once again breathe though so I am pleased. I spot my future ex wife in the lobby. We had such a good thing going but I know that no measure of counseling will be able to unravel the day's turmoil and mental scaring.   1:47p Arrive at Emerald City Smoothie and proceed to order a 32 oz beverage. 402 calories, 0 fat and 14 grams of protein -- effectively negating any caloric burn or benefit from the last 90 minutes. I finish it in 3 minutes and spend the next 2 hours writing this memoir.   3:47p Create Craigslist ad while burning final 2 grams of protein from Smoothie and before the ""shakes"" consume my body.   4:29p Note to self - check car for missing wet yoga towel in am.

Anyone who wants the full details of how this scoring works (in addition to examples) can check out the scoring section of our [contest summary page](http://www.fantasypros.com/2011-fantasypros-forum-challenge/).

A 100% PAY™ is a perfect score and means that every single member of the group picked the correct players. * The relative importance of each decision is baked into the scoring. We look at the spread in fantasy points for each set of players in a match-up. Match-ups with larger point spreads are deemed to be more important decisions given the opportunity cost of making the wrong choice. Those predictions, therefore, carry more weight.  &gt;One other note from last week is that we scrubbed out the Knowshon Moreno vs. Joseph Addai match-up since Moreno was inactive for the game. We feel that's the fairest way to handle this match-up since we want to avoid the ""will he or won't he play"" guessing game that arises from injuries. We'll definitely do our best to try to avoid selecting match-ups where a player could be inactive in the future. If that does happen, though, we'll always scrub the match-up.  ",™

The great thing about shotguns is that they can use a wide variety of ammunition and, if you know what you are doing, can serve a number of uses. I would suggest a load out of birdshot shells for small game hunting (for emergency survival), slugs for bear protection, and some flare rounds for being spotted.   So the gun you already have could serve your needs fine if you are willing to spend 30-40 dollars on the right ammo.    &gt; 12 GAUGE HIGH ALTITUDE RED FLARE  &gt; THESE FLARES WILL RISE TO AN ALTITUDE OF WELL OVER 300 FEET WHEN FIRED AT A 70 DEGREE ANGLE, IN WHICH A SINGLE STAR IS RELEASED AND WILL BURN FOR APPROXIMATELY SIX TO SEVEN SECONDS.

No I won't wish you luck when I'm trying to beat you, no I'm not going to tell you to have fun while playing a game. I get BM'd more often than not by people who gl hf me when I don't reply.

Your boss isn't always going to tell you ""Wow great job on that power point!"" while you get high fives from your co-workers at the office.  Also it's not like everyone who is ""BM"" in sc2 has never played a game with a bad community. Yeah we get it, ""You should play X game then come talk to me about BM."" Most of us have, doesn't mean when we play SC2 we think ""Oh golly this community is so much nicer than X game's community, lets be nice to everyone! ♥♥♥"". Also like someone else said, people need to stop thinking they deserve a gl hf or a gg every game. Just because you beat me or I beat meant the game was good. I played a zerg yesterday who fucked up a drone split vs some hellions and quit. I didn't message him after like ""NO GG!?!? MANNER FAGGOT!"" because it wasn't a good game and he knew it, he fucked up and it was an easy win. Happens to me when I fuck up, I just quit and don't say gg because it wasn't a good game.  For me saying gl hf doesn't mean shit because I don't mean anything when I say it. Like really? Good luck, have fun? Good game is more understandable and is the only thing I mean when I say it out of the two because I only say it when it was a good game. Most of the time I'm here to beat you, not wish you fun and luck and hope you have a great time while you play.

The folks who send out the talking points to the punditocracy are perfectly aware of the ""real"" definition of socialism in economics or political science.  They just don't care. They know it is a useful word for stirring up the masses.  Epithets like commie, red, pinko, etc are still around and still used regularly by folks like Glenn Beck, but they don't carry quite the punch anymore among the general public due to the demise of the Soviet Union and the capitalist drive in China.   Socialism is Communism Lite™ and is that much more frightening to these folks because it is softer, more insidious, more tempting, more appealing, and more lasting and permanent than Communism ever was.  Somewhere deep in their subconscious they have a dim understanding that the United States and all other Western countries stopped being purely capitalist (if they ever were) nearly a century ago, but they view their efforts as holding the line, or even attempting a heroic global rollback in the vein of Reagan and the Soviets.    The fact that Obama is the most centrist or even right-leaning Democratic President in many decades is irrelevant.  ""Socialism"" is a useful smear against any Democrat, and Obama's blackness is probably predisposing *ahem* certain people to accept the Socialist label on Obama. And once you believe he's a socialist, everything he touches is tainted.

t5_6,grumblichu,1316719089,"Text of the article:   &gt;GENEVA (AP) -- A fundamental pillar of physics - that nothing can go faster than the speed of light - appears to be smashed by an oddball subatomic particle that has apparently made a giant end run around Albert Einstein's theories.  &gt;Scientists at the world's largest physics lab said Thursday they have clocked neutrinos traveling faster than light. That's something that according to Einstein's 1905 special theory of relativity - the famous E (equals) mc2 equation - just doesn't happen.  &gt;""The feeling that most people have is this can't be right, this can't be real,"" said James Gillies, a spokesman for the European Organization for Nuclear Research, or CERN, outside the Swiss city of Geneva.  &gt;Gillies told The Associated Press that the readings have so astounded researchers that they are asking others to independently verify the measurements before claiming an actual discovery.  &gt;""They are inviting the broader physics community to look at what they've done and really scrutinize it in great detail, and ideally for someone elsewhere in the world to repeat the measurements,"" he said Thursday.  &gt;Scientists at the competing Fermilab in Chicago have promised to start such work immediately.  &gt;""It's a shock,"" said Fermilab head theoretician Stephen Parke, who was not part of the research in Geneva. ""It's going to cause us problems, no doubt about that - if it's true.""  &gt;The Chicago team had similar faster-than-light results in 2007, but those came with a giant margin of error that undercut its scientific significance.  &gt;Outside scientists expressed skepticism at CERN's claim that the neutrinos - one of the strangest well-known particles in physics - were observed smashing past the cosmic speed barrier of 186,282 miles per second (299,792 kilometers per second).  &gt;University of Maryland physics department chairman Drew Baden called it ""a flying carpet,"" something that was too fantastic to be believable.  &gt;CERN says a neutrino beam fired from a particle accelerator near Geneva to a lab 454 miles (730 kilometers) away in Italy traveled 60 nanoseconds faster than the speed of light. Scientists calculated the margin of error at just 10 nanoseconds, making the difference statistically significant. But given the enormous implications of the find, they still spent months checking and rechecking their results to make sure there was no flaws in the experiment.  &gt;""We have not found any instrumental effect that could explain the result of the measurement,"" said Antonio Ereditato, a physicist at the University of Bern, Switzerland, who was involved in the experiment known as OPERA.  &gt;The CERN researchers are now looking to the United States and Japan to confirm the results.  &gt;A similar neutrino experiment at Fermilab near Chicago would be capable of running the tests, said Stavros Katsanevas, the deputy director of France's National Institute for Nuclear and Particle Physics Research. The institute collaborated with Italy's Gran Sasso National Laboratory for the experiment at CERN.  &gt; Katsanevas said help could also come from the T2K experiment in Japan, though that is currently on hold after the country's devastating March 11 earthquake and tsunami.  &gt; Scientists agree if the results are confirmed, that it would force a fundamental rethink of the laws of nature.  &gt;Einstein's special relativity theory that says energy equals mass times the speed of light squared underlies ""pretty much everything in modern physics,"" said John Ellis, a theoretical physicist at CERN who was not involved in the experiment. ""It has worked perfectly up until now.""  &gt; He cautioned that the neutrino researchers would have to explain why similar results weren't detected before, such as when an exploding star - or supernova - was observed in 1987.  &gt; ""This would be such a sensational discovery if it were true that one has to treat it extremely carefully,"" said Ellis.  &gt; © 2011 The Associated Press.",©

t5_2qyt6,Sylocat,1316820161,"Let me preface this by saying that I am not one of those r/atheism types who views all religion as an absolute negative and thinks that any vocal rejection of it is a good thing. And I'm not just saying that to curry favor with the more open-minded (I personally am a secular Buddhist, and yes there is such a thing).  That said, I would be more inclined to pass judgment on independent films for ""unfair"" treatment of Christianity, if mainstream media were not consistently portraying Christianity as the bee's knees. Yes, there are exceptions, but whenever there is an agnostic character struggling with their faith in a mainstream movie, they can be relied upon to have rediscovered their Jesus-obsession by the end. Even fully-atheistic characters will usually find Jesus (and they never convert to any other religion). Half of the mainstream science fiction movies and TV shows jump at the chance to portray science and scientific thought as evil, and fall back on the ""We Must Not Tamper In God's Domain™"" crutch to appease the anti-intellectual strain of the audience.  The skeptic is never right in horror movies. Scientific hubris is the cause of the apocalypse. [ME AM PLAY GODS](http://dresdencodak.com/2009/09/22/caveman-science-fiction/).  *Doctor Who*, for all its examples of some of the most ridiculous pseudoscientific technobabble imaginable, is one of the only science fiction TV shows that is actually designed as an expression of the enlightenment and the triumph of the intellect, rather than an anti-science screed and a full endorsement of the ""Guns, guts and God"" approach to all problems.  Again, I'm not denigrating Christianity, it's great for some people. But I'm having a hard time sympathizing if they think they're getting persecuted by independent film.",™

t5_2rd6n,celoyd,1316830445,"It would be my pleasure!  Here’s a quick and easy way of getting cool images out of MODIS. There are a lot of other ways if you get into it, but this one should serve you well for now.  As an example, let’s say we’re looking for a good satellite photo of a large, rugged but fairly cultivated island.  Start on [the LANCE subset directory](http://lance.nasa.gov/imagery/rapid-response/subsets/). A *subset* is just a chunk of geography as seen by MODIS, presented with a consistent projection and indexed over time. A given point on the earth might be covered by different subsets with different purposes – one agency might have it in a subset to study logging, another in a subset to track air pollution, another in a subset that looks for flooding, and so on.  Let’s look in Africa. Click Africa under Places and [this page](http://lance-modis.eosdis.nasa.gov/imagery/subsets/?area=af) will open in a new window. Every red square here is a clickable subset. The background image of Africa is *not* exactly what we’ll see; it’s an idealized, cloudless composite. Let’s have a look at Madagascar, the large island to the southeast of the continent. This happens to be covered by “FAS Subsets”, the upper right overview map.  When you click the red box around Madagascar, you’ll see [this](http://lance-modis.eosdis.nasa.gov/imagery/subsets/?subset=Madagascar.2011266): a matrix of different observations made by the two satellites that make up MODIS. The leftmost column is the one with visibile light, and of those two the top one (from the Terra satellite) is the only one with complete data. (Incomplete data is white. It can be incomplete because of the way the satellites’ orbits worked out, because there was a reception problem, or – when you’re looking at today’s page – because the satellite hasn’t been overhead yet.)  So let’s click that upper left picture. [Ta-da!](http://lance-modis.eosdis.nasa.gov/imagery/subsets/?subset=Madagascar.2011266.terra.1km)  Two things to note:  1. You can zoom in and out with the “View alternate pixel size” links. The default is that 1 pixel = 1000 m, or one kilometer. At 2 km, the image is half as wide, at 500 m it’s twice as wide, and so on.  2. The simplest way to download the image is to click directly on it. It took me a while to figure this out….  So if you want oodles of rugged island texture, you can click “250m” and get – don’t click this if your computer is low on memory, because it’s a 21 megapixel image – [this](http://lance-modis.eosdis.nasa.gov/imagery/subsets/?subset=Madagascar.2011266.terra.250m). Phew!  Now, there’s a potential problem here: clouds. We could go back to the matrix of images taken of that subset that day, then click the “prev” button until we spot a nice clear image. Or we could de a web search for the dry season in Madagascar and type a date in that range into the Data field. (I recall some subsets have a great calendar view with thumbnails for entire months on one page, but frankly I forget where to find that. Keep an eye out!)  If you want to try another approach, we can go back to [the LANCE subset directory](http://lance.nasa.gov/imagery/rapid-response/subsets/) and pick one of the Projects. As an example, let’s go with the last one, the miscellaneous “Other Subsets”. This gives us [a map of the world with subsets distributed at what looks like random](http://lance-modis.eosdis.nasa.gov/imagery/subsets/?project=other). You can choose any one of those and get a subset view just like we saw for Madagascar. For example, [here’s the British Isles](http://lance-modis.eosdis.nasa.gov/imagery/subsets/?subset=United_Kingdom_Ireland.2011266): looks pretty cloudy today.  There’s a lot more to get into, but I hope that’s enough to get you started. If you have any questions, please ask.  I ♥ MODIS.",♥

t5_2qh13,Vulpyne,1316985083,"&gt; Then why did you refer to the whole of the world population? Are you implying that everybody is suffering?  You initially said that bullfights are a drop in the ocean of cattle suffering.   * Suffering generated by aggregate bullfights ↔ All cattle suffering  * Death caused by me killing homeless person ↔ All human life  Just because something is a small piece of an aggregate doesn't mean it cannot be judged or opposed if it's considered negative, or that actions which remove the negative are not to be considered positive and worthwhile.  Hopefully my response makes more sense to you now.  Now you could have said ""The suffering from bullfights is fairly small compared to that caused by the factory farm industry. We should focus our energies on eliminating the latter before the former."" although I may still have disagreed. Did you read the link I supplied in my last response?  &gt; As has often been pointed out, banning bullfighting altogether wouldn't just remove the suffering of the bullfights themselves but also result in the eradication of the bullfighting bull breeds, as they wouldn't have a purpose any more. [...]  Are you equating not breeding members of a species with killing individuals of the species that already exist? If so, I don't think that is a defensible argument.   &gt; Well, I disagree. That's just a recipe for a tyranny of the majority, who can make heavy-handed, intolerant laws as they know they won't have to suffer the consequences. There's a reason why equality before the law is considered a fundamental principle of Western democracies.  Uniform application of harm prevention should obviously be the goal. As I said before, I will accept some hypocrisy if I believe it is a net gain. I guess we'll just have to disagree on this point - at least for the most general case.",↔

Big McGee Lake was an awesome place to camp at.. though I didn't do any fishing there were some people doing that, as i looked on enviously.  There was also a Mule Pack station right at the trail head, if you want to go that route here is the website.  [http://www.mcgeecreekpackstation.com/](http://www.mcgeecreekpackstation.com/)   ----------------------------- Red Slate Mountain September 17-19, 2010 As advertised:  Friday - Sunday, Sept. 17 - 19   WTC, SPS, Long Beach I: Red Slate Mountain (13,123').  Enjoy a late summer weekend in this colorful, high-elevation setting.  Friday morning hike 7.5 miles 2500' gain up McGee Creek through aspens, pines and meadows to the beautiful red rock mountains of upper McGee Creek Canyon. We'll camp alongside Big McGee Lake at 10,500' elevation. Sat. morning hike to McGee Pass, climb Red Slate Mountain (Class 2, approx. 2700' gain, 6 miles roundtrip), and return to camp for happy hour. Sunday morning hike out. Total mileage approx. 25 miles roundtrip, 5200' gain, moderate pace. $5 permit fee payable to Ldr. E-mail both leaders with experience and conditioning.   WTC Students: Remember to bring your class card for the leaders to sign if you need this trip to graduate!  USGS Quad: Benton Range Weather Link: http://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?lat=37.488207821449535&amp;lon=-118.84048461914062&amp;site=rev&amp;smap=1&amp;unit=0&amp;lg=en&amp;FcstType=text Advance Information: http://www.summitpost.org/mountain/rock/150597/red-slate-mountain.html We'll be climbing via the southeast slope, or possibly the ridge.  Directions to Trailhead: Turn left from US 395 on McGee Creek Road (north of Bishop near Crowley Lake) and follow it to the trailhead parking area at the end of the road, past the pack station.  The road turns to packed gravel about a mile from the end. Map to Trailhead: http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;hl=en&amp;msa=0&amp;ll=37.550702,-118.812504&amp;spn=0.021707,0.045018&amp;z=15&amp;msid=102860879910653752742.00048efd8b7f30d0817cf  (Copy and paste to your browser's address bar if the link gets split by your e-mail program!)  Proper food Storage:  Bear canisters are recommended but not required on this trail by the US Forest Service, but they are required by the leaders for this trip. Bear bagging is not an effective method for keeping bears away from your food, and we are not willing to chance inviting bears or other wildlife into our campsite.  Clean food, trash, and scented items out of your car before you leave it at the trailhead.  Put coolers or water bottles out of sight in your trunk or cargo area.  More information: http://www.fs.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsinternet/!ut/p/c4/04_SB8K8xLLM9MSSzPy8xBz9CP0os3gDfxMDT8MwRydLA1cj72DTUE8TAwjQL8h2VAQAMtzFUw!!/?ss=110504&amp;navtype=BROWSEBYSUBJECT&amp;cid=FSBDEV3_003846&amp;navid=150100000000000&amp;pnavid=150000000000000&amp;position=SubFeature*&amp;ttype=detailfull&amp;pname=Inyo%2520National%2520Forest-%2520Outdoor%2520Safety%2520&amp;%2520Ethics  Altitiude Acclimatization: Our campsite is over 10,000 feet, and you may have problems hiking up to that altitude, especially coming from sea level. If you have to leave the trip early because of altitude sickness, we won't be able to sign your class card.  So, come up as early as you can on Thursday and camp or lodge near the trailhead between 7500-9000 feet to give yourself time to adjust.  Pat and I will be spending the night at the McGee Creek Campground, not far from the trailhead (sites are first come, first served).  There are other campgrounds and lodges in the area if you prefer more creature comforts.  Consider Tom's Place or McGee Creek Lodge.  Bishop will not cut it; it's too low in elevation to do you any good.  See your doctor for an Rx for acetazolamide (Diamox®) if you know you may have difficulty.  Also, we will hike in at a very moderate pace.  This isn't a race, and it will help you adjust to the higher altitude.  Remember to hydrate well before the trip and stay that way during.  We'll be happy to stop for split breaks as often as necessary!  Recent altitude experience will also do you a lot of good, so get up to one of our local 10K+ peaks next weekend if you haven't been on a high altitude trip in the last couple of weeks.  Carpooling:  I am supplying a participant list to help you arrange carpools - see attachment.   If you can't open it, let me know.  Legal Notes: In the interests of facilitating the logistics of some outings, it is customary that participants make carpooling arrangements.The Sierra Club does not have insurance for carpooling arrangements and assumes no liability for them. Carpooling, ride sharing, or anything similar is strictly a private arrangement among the participants. Participants assume the risks associated with this travel.    All participants on Sierra Club outings are required to sign a standard liability waiver. If you would like to read the Liability Waiver before you choose to participate on an outing, please go to: http://angeles.sierraclub.org/LTC/transfers/SignInWaiver.pdf or contact the Outings Department at (415) 977-5528 for a printed version.  CST 2087766-40. Registration as a seller of travel does not constitute approval by the State of California.  Fun:  We'll do a garbage bag salad on Friday night and a Happy Hour on Saturday after our peak climb.  I'll send details in a separate message.  Thank you for reading this far!

Here are a few different translations of Romans 16:17 essentially saying to avoid people who are trying to sway you from your faith.  New International Version (©1984) I urge you, brothers, to watch out for those who cause divisions and put obstacles in your way that are contrary to the teaching you have learned. Keep away from them. New Living Translation (©2007) And now I make one more appeal, my dear brothers and sisters. Watch out for people who cause divisions and upset people's faith by teaching things contrary to what you have been taught. Stay away from them.  English Standard Version (©2001) I appeal to you, brothers, to watch out for those who cause divisions and create obstacles contrary to the doctrine that you have been taught; avoid them.  Weather you believe it or not Jesus did not teach hate. The rest of the Bible is up for discussion in my opinion which is why I take everything said with a grain of salt.

t5_2qh2p,GuitarGuru2001,1317068682,"Ex-christian here, checking in.  There are always two things to balance when weighing any translation: the literal-ness and the interpretation. Certain biblical passages and mannerisms make absolutely no sense in today's language.  That said if you want the word for word translation while maintaining the original structure of the hebrew language, go for the English Standard Version (ESV) or New American Standard Version (what most seminaries recommend).  If you want a good readable translation that waters down juussstt a bit, go for the Holman Christian Standard Version.  FCA's official bibles are Holman translations, and so if you didn't mind, you could probably get one for free from your local FCA.  the New International Version is probably the worst translation ever, barring using the king james in a modern sense.  Any pastor who's worth their weight in spit is going to dissuade you from using it. It is rife with [errors](http://www.mountainretreatorg.net/articles/niv.html) and is absolutely awful.  Sad thing is its one of the most widely used platforms, and I learned about my former faith using it.  tl;dr I'd recommend Holman or NASB for your purposes. Stay clear of NIV, it omits tons of good stuff.  EDIT: thought i'd throw out a comparison of three versions.  Hebrews 11:11 is a key verse about sara giving birth in her old age:  New International Version (©1984) By faith Abraham, even though he was past age--and Sarah herself was barren--was enabled to become a father because he considered him faithful who had made the promise.  English Standard Version (©2001) By faith Sarah herself received power to conceive, even when she was past the age, since she considered him faithful who had promised.  Holman Christian Standard Bible By faith even Sarah herself, when she was barren, received power to conceive offspring, even though she was past the age, since she considered that the One who had promised was faithful.  Note the Holman is in between the two extremes, making it an easier read but maintaining the original emphases",©

t5_6,nickyj6,1317076170,"Are you thinking about starting or adding to your food storage but aren’t sure what’s available?  Follow these guidelines to avoid any costly mistakes.  1. How does the food taste?   Yes, if you’re hungry enough just about anything tastes good, especially in an emergency.  Why settle for cardboard?  Both Wise Foods™ and Daily Bread™ products provide an assortment of great-tasting, gourmet entrees, breakfasts and beverages that your family will love to eat!  The entrees consist of both freeze-dried and dehydrated ingredients to insure the best taste, texture and nutritional value.    2. How long can the food be stored before I have to throw it out?  Most canned and dry food from the grocery store is only good for two years at the most, requiring frequent replacement of the items. Wise Foods™ and Daily Bread™ have an extended shelf life of up to 25 years.    3. How much space is my food storage going to take?  I have limited room. Wise Foods™ meals are packaged in Mylar pouches and then incased in durable plastic containers with handles. Wise Foods™ are light-weight and condensed.  A one-year supply of food for an adult with 1,080 meals weighs less than 60 pounds and comes in nine stackable and easy-to-move grab-and-go plastic containers.  Daily Bread™ is packaged in #10 cans, which are then shipped in boxes with four cans per box.  A one-year supply for one adult will fit in a space measuring 44 inches high by 130 inches long and 13 inches deep. The boxes are stackable.  Is the food time-consuming or difficult to cook?  Both brands couldn’t be simpler to prepare. Just add water and wait 10 to 12 minutes.  You don’t even need to heat the water unless you want to.  Although, we think it tastes better when you do.  What could be easier?  5. How much money is food storage going to cost?  Wise Foods™ and Daily Bread™ products are offered at great prices with entrees as low as $1.50 per serving when ordering multi-serving packages.  There are many options for the size of your order, ranging from an entree for just two people up to a 12-month supply that will feed four adults.  Because the products have a 25 year shelf life, you won’t need to rotate and replace the products for many years, making them even more economical and saving you money.    We hope you never need to rely on your emergency food storage.  However, when a disaster occurs, make certain that you and your loved ones are ready.   To order these and other emergency preparedness products, please visit us at www.survivalsupplies4u.com. ",™

t5_2qh2p,fromkentucky,1317132312,"&gt;I have never been able to answer this question myself so I have a hard time ruling anything out  Except for this option:  &gt;isn't it illogical to think that our universe created itself with no guidance.  You've obviously ruled that one out.   &gt;no one can answer these types of questions without taking leaps of faith.   You're absolutely correct. You know what a ""divine creator"" is? An answer. Not only that, but it's a leap of faith that stems from an anthropomorphized worldview, where causality is absolute and everything that doesn't occur in nature is ""built"" by us. Except for nature. So... being the narrow-minded, psychologically-projecting simpletons we are, we just *assumed* that there was another Creator who started this whole thing, giving no thought to the complexity of that Creator's description, abilities, origins or age, but still somehow claiming knowledge of His/Her intentions.   Then we started thinking. Slowly we began to realize that maybe there are some logical issues with this story... A few, ""intellectual obstacles"" if you will. Thus began apologetics.   And you're really gonna sit there and tell me that inventing all of this without any supporting evidence suggesting that such a being is even capable of existing without violating nearly every aspect of this universe's nature and operation, is *less irrational* than simply recognizing what the evidence has been showing us all along: a Creator wasn't necessary.  &gt;what it suggests is that we know what we know and we know nothing more than that.   You're right, but we *can* infer from that knowledge, and test to see if those inferences are true, gaining more knowledge. Even knowing that our guess is wrong, is knowledge. That's how science works. So far, every single experiment to test numerous aspects of nature has shown ""Divine Guidance"" to be simply unnecessary. It's not that There Is No God™ it's just that it may be time we recognize that God is a man made idea that has failed to be a necessary part of every explanation science has uncovered.   It only exists in churches and places that science has yet to reach, and even in the latter, it only gains a foothold when we equate doubt and ignorance with possibility and plausibility:  &gt;there is no evidence for the questions that no atheist or scientist can answer: how was universe?  &gt;I have never been able to answer this question myself so I have a hard time ruling anything out  It's time we stop making excuses and backing ourselves into intellectual corners like ""science can't answer this question"" and be honest about the *rest* of that statement, which is ""so it's okay to believe this is true."" And if anyone challenges it, you just accuse them of not being open minded, when the truth is, you are the one with the mind that's closed to any threats to this last vestige of your spirituality.   &gt;if it was a Big Bang, how were those materials provided?  I hope you do at least realize that God is not an answer to this question. If not, here's why:   Even if there was a Divine Artificer, which we may call God, *that still doesn't explain where the matter and energy came from.* However, you've now introduced yet another thing whose existence must be explained. If God just made all of the stuff to build the universe, then it still came from nothing. So what we're actually left with is this:  Either  A) The Universe spontaneously erupted from a singularity whose origin is unknown.  or   B) An all-powerful being popped into existence of His own accord and made the Universe from nothing by a method for which there is no explanation and no other recorded instance bearing any resemblance to such a magical event and simultaneously made himself entirely undetectable, except to people experiencing what looks very similar to hallucinations and delusions.   A or B? Which one of those sounds more rational to you?  Before you decide, here's a few things to consider about our universe:  Even empty space, what we think of as ""nothing,"" has measurable mass.   Time is a property *of this universe*, meaning it did not exist before our universe. There was no *time* for God to exist, decide to initiate Creation and say, ""Let there be light.""   Gravity separated from the primordial superforce on its own, initiating the division of the other forces. This is an intrinsic property of gravity.   Particles pop in and out of existence continually on the quantum level. They literally appear randomly, from nothing, and then disappear too, without cause.   From Neutrality, a dichotomy may form: 0 = (-1) + (+1)  It didn't come from Nothingness, my friend. Have you ever considered that Nothingness may not even be possible?

t5_2qhon,Cheeseho12,1317173970,"When creating comics no filing of copyright is needed.  Under current law an 'original creation' is automatically copyrighted upon its creation in a 'fixed medium' (as soon as you write or draw it). Registering a copyright is generally only done as a precursor to legal action, or in anticipation of legal action.  As long as your comic has a publication date and a one line notice of copyright (ex: RedditDude#1 © September 2011 by Steve Jobs) you're cool.    Now, if your book sells 100,000 copies, then you might want to look into copyrighting it, but seeing as most indie comics sell somewhere around of 5,000 (that's if you're published by a studio, if you're doing it yourself, look forward to sales south of 500), you're most likely fine.    Even if someone steals your idea (which in a decade of publishing I've never seen happen beyond the occasional t-shirt, and the Emily the Strange weirdness) the plus to you is you're covered, the drawback is the qualification for what counts as 'original' is pretty low, there is a test where you have to find five distinct similarities before you can go forward with any sort of legal action, and then you have to have the money to follow through with it.",©

If we are talking a month or even 2 that's not so bad, but if it's what I remember of 5-6 months, that still is ar too long. Anyone who preorders still has an advantage for simply buying a game before it's out. Isn't there also Map Exclusive content?   I just looked it up and infact preorder people do infact get maps other people cannot get until much later.  ""In addition to the launch day exclusive weapons, the Physical Warfare Pack also includes the Battlefield 3 Back to Karkand digital expansion pack. Players can wage all-out war on four of the most celebrated maps from Battlefield 2, including Strike at Karkand, Gulf of Oman and the Sharqi Peninsula, all stunningly re-created using the power of Frostbite™ 2.""  That is my opinion is fucking bullshit. So if I don't preorder I'm fucked out of some maps for a few months. Join a server with the maps running and when ever they come up I get booted. With no way of getting them until they are released via waiting. That IMO is bull shit. I shouldn't be punished by not being able to play the full game simply because I don't want to pay for something before it's released.  All in all I am still boycotting this game, and I hope many of us still are.",™

t5_2qlqk,Elliptical_Tangent,1317222413,"&gt;See the difference between us is that you, for reasons that are unfathomable to me, seem to fear the nation. I fear my neighbors, I fear my state capitol. I see salvation from the petty bigotries and stupidity of my neighbors in the national government.  Please understand I don't fear any government level, and you had already made it perfectly clear to me that you fear your local and State governments.  My objection to Federal control of my life is that I'm one voice in 300+ million whereas if my local government had primary control of my life, I'd be one in 1,100.  If my State had control, I'd be one in ~1.5 million.  &gt;The hated minority group of one subsection of the nation is not so hated in other subsections.  Is this why we got DOMA?  I don't think your idea here holds water, sorry.  Did you know that Mississippi's blacks constitute 37% of the population?  And &gt; 30% in Georgia.  Whites in both States are &lt; 60%.  Now, the only way whites (who I'm assuming are the ones you think hate blacks) can pass laws against black people in those States is if an overwhelming majority of the white population are hateful racists, and motivated enough to go to the polls while blacks (and other minority groups) stay home.  And how long do those laws stand before pressure from interest groups get going?  How long is someone willing to go to the polls and vote racist policy in when they're shown to be hateful racists?  &gt;&gt; When did forcing people to do what you think is right become a progressive value?  &gt;That looks a lot like telling me that protecting rights is ""forcing people to do what you think is right"".  Only when you're forcing people to do something they don't want to do.  Your assumption, based on your underlying fears about your neighbors, is that Bad Things™ will happen if the Fed isn't in control, but that doesn't make it true.  Is the Federal government protecting our rights as equals under the law when they pass DOMA?  Think about your underlying assumptions.  &gt;Yes. Exactly. You understand perfectly. I see the national government and the real Constitution as the only defense I have against my state government and it's theocratic and tyrannical aims. Slavery is an excellent example.  Well, then I don't know why I'm bothering.  I can't talk to your fear, only your mind.  &gt;No. Because that's so completely false I don't even know where to begin. Where, exactly, do you think the civil rights movement started? Do you think Martin Luther King jr was from New York?  Precisely.  And Dr. King made changes.  What's your point?  If anything it supports my proposition that these unjust laws won't stand because people will mobilize to overturn them.  Anyhow, I'm sorry you're so upset by this.

t5_2qio8,Clbull,1317226959,"I got buffed, but nowhere near enough.  Holy is the only decent Paladin spec and it still feels lackluster compared to the utility of other healing classes like Druids, Priests or Shamans. Apart from two instant heals (one that is weak and generates holy power and the other that is a holy power dump), three variations of single target heal for different situations and a shit AoE heal, Holy has no utility.  Druids get to shower their targets with HoTs, Priests get to shield loads and mana drain in PvP, hard-countering any other healer and Shamans get a variety of multi target heals (like Healing Rain, Chain Heal etc)  What do Paladins get? The ability to heal a second predetermined target for a crap amount with Beacon of Light. That's right, just that.  And then look at Prot. At first it was decent until the Word of Glory nerf came in, making one of their major mitigation talents near worthless. Now it's the worst class in terms of threat and doesn't really make up for it in terms of mitigation.  And finally, Retribution. People claim the spec's damage is unreal but that's only if you go in all cooldowns blazing and don't get shut down by a stun or a slow or a snare or any other form of CC.  Meanwhile, Warriors at high gear levels are hitting [above the equivalent of a Templar's Verdict (That is usually on an indirect 9 second cooldown based on how long it takes to generate the HP for it) *every fucking second*.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoqpI1TsI3A) *(in this video, look at Swifty's damage when he executes this ""one shot macro"" in Arenas, not the absurd 300k crits he does using buffs disallowed in a normal Arena/Rated BG setting.)*  If there's a better case against buffing the Paladin class, please show me it.  With an item level 359 weapon and PvP gear, TV will at best hit 15 - 16k crits on high Resileinced targets.  Furthermore, they're not only like Warriors but with a fraction of the damage dealing potential, but they have none of the utility. A warrior has charge, a warrior has intercept, a warrior has heroic leap, a warrior has colossus smash, a warrior has intercept, a warrior has Hamstring, a warrior has enraged regeneration, a warrior has victory rush, a warrior has intimidating shout.  A Paladin has none of those things. All they have is a 6 second stun (Warriors already have two talent-trained 5 second equivalents called Throwdown in Arms and Concussion Blow in Prot), an Incapacitate, and an Interrupt.  And before you argue that Paladins have Long Arm of the Law to let them get into range of their targets, note that it gets negated by something as measly as a slow. In order to utilise the full effect, often you'll need to spam Cleanse, greatly draining your Mana pool or use Hand of Freedom.  Now, show me a YouTube video of a Ret Paladin doing warrior equivalent crits every fucking GCD in PvP and I will shut the fuck up and retreat back into my hole, but in the meantime, I am here arguing about why my class is cannon fodder for everything else and has the simplicity and actual potential of a Fisher Price My First World of Warcraft Class™",™

This is absolutely true. I made a leap there. It would probably be fairer to say that the contradiction of situations in the post allows people to guess that ""something might be up"". But at that point it's so general that it loses any useful meaning. I think I'm coming around to your viewpoint on the matter.  &gt; Whether you are wrong or I am wrong, the fact of the matter is, your still defending the act of making newcomers potentially feel unwelcome.    Here is where I really must protest. Quite the contrary, I'm not defending the act of making newcomers potentially feel unwelcome. I'm saying that that is not what people are doing. They aren't trying to potentially make newcomers unwelcome.    I would say that they're acting in a normal fashion within a pre-existing social structure and that, generally speaking, the community acts in a healthy way to help nurture and inform new members. There are always outliers, but I believe they are just that: outliers.    My concern with your statement is that if we even pay lip service to the idea of being concerned about _potentially_ insulting, offending, or hurting someone's feelings in a way that may be considered unwelcome then we run the risk of removing some of the remaining constructive conversation that /r/starcraft generates.    Take our conversation right here. If I was more guarded with my words for fear of insulting you, or if you hadn't been willing to chastise what you felt was a wrong doing, we would never have reached this point of mutual understanding.    I'd rather see people less guarded about what they say (within reason) than have people watching their words and worrying about making newcomers uncomfortable.    Being new in any community is always uncomfortable. Especially since every community (especially on the internet) has its fair share of very vocal jerks. As a new member you just need to remember that if you're at the point where you're running into the jerks, you're at the point where you're learning and growing your understanding of the community. At the very least you'll learn if it's worth learning how to deal with a particular community's jerks in order to join the community.    All that said, I can't discount your personal bad experience with trolls, bigots, and grammar nazi. I just hope the frequency with which you have to deal with them wanes. :)    Best wishes, and we ♥ you too! Don't forget it!",♥

In this case, Nvidia is trying to sell their product so I've decided to give them a free pass instead of unleashing my Ultra Gamer Rage Attack™. Such an attack would surely change the minds of millions, and without warning turn the entire technology industry on it's head, thus leaving Silicon Valley (and the like) scrambling to implement the golden ideas they've had the honor of receiving from me. Instead, what I'm going to do is say this...:  ** *apples and oranges.* **  That's right, apples and deliciously orange oranges. One is apple, and the other, not apple. One is sometimes green, and the other, ehhh..., I mean it is sometimes a little green as well but you get my point. You don't see people going around sharing their love for oranges and hatred of apples because they know that when they get done venting, they have maybe a .24% chance of changing that person's opinion.  Some people prefer consoles. Some people prefer PC's. Some people own both, and some own none. Some people own a console but want a PC, and some people own a PC, but find they often want to play on a console. Some people love their PC because they can surf the web after they game, and some people hate you because Microsoft gave them a microphone with their x-box and they just want you to know you're a fag. Whatever you want/love/hate/own you should appreciate the fact that this is one of many things that makes you unique. And in my personal opinion, if everyone wanted and loved and hated and owned the same things, life would be a bit boring, wouldn't you agree?  PS catsvalvebacon",™

I own a original xbox running xbmc, its really a great machine, but it is easily outclassed by any Intel Atom/Ion HTPC.   **Xbox limitations and rules to follow when replacing the hard drive:**   •A 7200rpm harddrive won't give any speed improvements over a 5400rpm, and the 5400rpm runs cooler and quieter.   •Neither do you get a speed increase out of more harddrive cache so save money and get one with less.   •Up to 2TB (2048GB) in size. Upgrading your harddrive will also speedup Xbox loading and boot-up times.   -Note: XBMC only supports F: and G: partitions for harddrives and 512GB per partition! If you want to install a harddrive larger than 137GB then you need a LBA48 compatible Xbox 'hacked' BIOS.   •If a partition is larger than 256GB, the harddrive needs to be formatted with 32k clusters, use XBpartitioner 1.1 or later.XBpartitioner 1.1 or later is used to partition extra partitions such as F: and G: (not the default C:, E:, X:, Y: and Z:)   •Largest partition supported by a LBA48 BIOS and 32k clusters is 512GB, so 512GB+ need G: partition.   **In regards to USB Mass Storage devices:**  •The following are known XBMC (and Xbox) limitations (if you are a programmer then help us overcome the XBMC limitations*):   •Only ""read-only"" support for FAT12/FAT16/FAT32 (so write support is limited to FATX)*   •Maximum 4GB in 'device'/'drive' size (ie. the size of the whole flash-storage or harddrive)*   **And [here](http://www.xbmc4xbox.org/wiki/index.php?title=XBMC_Features_and_Supported_Formats/Codecs) is a list of all the supported media content.**  *In general, XBMC running on a standard Xbox cannot play native HD format videos, but can upscale standard definition or lower format video to HD resolutions.*   **The XBox's 733Mhz Intel Pentium-III CPU, is too slow to play native HD video (Microsoft® and DivX® recommends a 2.4 Ghz PC + 384MB RAM for 720p MPEG-4 playback!). This means that you might only get maybe 10-20fps (frames per second) displayed, which will appear jerky and un-viewable.**  -On a standard XBox the following HD formats are supported:   •480i/480p/576i/576p output at 480p (Not Scaled).   •480i/480p/576i/576p output at 720p (Upscaled).   •480i/480p/576i/576p output at 1080i (Upscaled).   **-The following video resolutions are NOT supported, at any output resolution:**   •720p   •1080i   This is the site where I copy pasta'd all this info from, [xbmc4xbox.org wiki](http://www.xbmc4xbox.org/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page). Just beware what the limitations are, I'm not trying to convince you not to use the xbox, jus want to make sure you know what to expect. I dont know about the Wii though, I'd imagine it would have a few similar limitations on HD content.",®

t5_2cneq,jaeldi,1317303453,"Your use of percentages in #2 makes you look foolish to me.   ""The top 1% of earners are paying 38% of all income taxes"". To summarize, the wealthy pay more taxes. Isn't that because they are earning more money? Yes it is. So big fat ""DUH!"" on your #2.   Does the tax code already tax higher incomes at a higher percentage? Yes it does. Is that fair? meh, not really, but fair is a relative word. It's a democracy, the majority decides what is fair. The majority is not in that 1%, so too bad for them. Personally I would like to see a flat rate tax across all citizens, but even that system will have wealthy tax attorneys arguing that ""my client's crazy big pile of money they received this year is not 'income' and therefore shouldn't be taxed"" just like they do now. And lower income people can't afford those kind of services to protect their income from taxation. Lower income people will never make enough money to make it worth the tax attorney's trouble to pursue them as a client.  The business world has similar unbalanced tax policies. Currently small businesses can't compete with larger ""mega"" corps because Juan's Lawn Care of Dallas, who is successful and makes $200,000 profit a year can't afford a tax attorney to help him move that profit to Bermuda, call it international profit, and then not pay any tax in the US on that profit like Bank of America, Citigroup, At&amp;t, and Exxon can. That's not fair. That's not free market. There is a loop hole in a law creating this situation that is interfering with the free market in favor of wealthier companies.   Tax incentives are subsidies. All government subsidies, IMO, should go away. They always skew the real value of business holdings giving someone somewhere an unfair advantage. These tax policies are not free market. They are screwing the system up by allowing larger groups to stay large and keeping small groups small and not as wealthy. True conservatives, who believe less government is better, would be against tax incentives for anyone.   Plus I think your ideas on technology show inexperience. Jumps in technology can't help everyone all at once. A new technology often puts an old one out of business, so in the long game its a wash. You are saying the same thing about technology and economics that people were saying in '98 before it all washed away in 2000. That kind of thinking is 'get rich quick' and it never lasts, it creates extreme peaks and valleys.   With the current tax code, Juan's Lawn Care will never be able to amass that tipping point amount of wealth to become JUANCORP© on his own. Larger corps that make more money and don't pass as much tax will always out pace him. Now he could do what Zuckerberg did and find some investors to give him a mountain of money before he even made any profit, but that's a hard sell on a landscaping business. There is only one Mark Zuckerberg, there are tens of thousands of small business owners like Juan. It sounds like you are saying ""everyone should just do what that one guy who was in the right place at the right time did"".   What I'm saying is the current tax code is indeed flawed. Loopholes that allow people and businesses to pay less or no taxes should be removed, the definition of income should be simplified to tax all income levels more fairly (according to the democratic majority's opinion), and all incentives should be eliminated also for all income levels.",©

t5_2qhk3,Alanna,1317318560,"&gt;I have no interest in arguing the specifics of this article with you.   You said it wasn't misandric.  I went through and pointed out every misandric statement.  But, that's fine, a line by line debate does get tedious.  &gt;Schools are not criminal courts, nor do they have the power to imprison anyone; they are not required to base their administrative penalties on the standards of criminal law. Students can lose their scholarships is they cheat and/or plagiarise too; schools are not obliged to hold the equivalent of a criminal trial before tossing out cheaters.  Cheating is a matter of academic honesty.  It is the school's primary function to educate the students.  If they are cheating, they are not being educated in their subject, just in cheating.  Also, cheating is not (usually) against any laws, just against the college rules.  It's a little different than taking an already criminal act and completely disregarding if or any criminal investigation by actual authorities (theoretically) trained and knowledgeable in how to do so.    I am also not familiar with the standard of proof required to take action against a student for academic dishonesty.  Does it use the ""reasonable doubt,"" or just ""preponderance of evidence?""  &gt;Pick any active MR website you know of -- aside from 3 I will acknowledge are not completely overrun with misogyny -- and I will find some blatant misogyny on it that is supported by others or that goes unchallenged.

Would you like me to relate the appallingly misandric shit that passes for feminist discourse over at [Shakesville](http://shakespearessister.blogspot.com/), [Pandagon](http://pandagon.net/), [Justice for Women](http://www.justiceforwomen.org.uk/about-us/), [Feminism 101](http://finallyfeminism101.wordpress.com/), and [Eve Bit First](http://evebitfirst.wordpress.com/)?  Here's [one right on par](http://evebitfirst.wordpress.com/2010/10/07/a-rant/) with your ""explicit women-hating"" above:  &gt;Dear men:  &gt;Die.  &gt;No, seriously. This is a rant, and it’s about you, personally. You, personally, are a shit, because statistics indicate there is an almost 100% certainty that you have either committed a rape, or wanted to commit a rape, or knowingly assisted or defended someone who committed a rape, or mocked a woman who was raped. And no, I’m not dropping links to tell you what you should damn well already know.  She goes onto graphically wish horrible, painful, gory, nasty death on pretty much every man on earth.

The one famous for commenting on the *exoneration* of the Duke lacrosse team with, ""Can’t a few white boys sexually assault a black woman anymore without people getting all wound up about it?

From the comments of her latest post, [""Actually, science really doesn’t say that women who have sex are worthless""](http://pandagon.net/index.php/site/comments/actually_science_really_doesnt_say_that_women_who_have_sex_are_worthless):  &gt;Researchers?

Because I don’t need a man for myself and my offspring to survive, it turns the tables and now men are the ones that have to “compete” for me, rather than me “competing” for them...And that’s scary for Nice Guys because suddenly they have to care about what I want and maybe admit to themselves that the world doesn’t revolve around them.  It would be far easier for them to just go back to a time when they could buy a wife from her father, rather than actually being a decent human being that a woman might actually want to be with.  &gt;Seriously, slow dudes, if women were less “slutty,” you’d have less chance of getting laid. That’s not what you claim to want.  &gt;I’ve long held that Nice Guys™ would be much happier if they’d just learn to accept futility.  Some people simply can’t be attractive (in any sense of the word), or at least appeal to such a small niche that they’re unlikely to meet anyone in it, and all of this whiny pseudo-science and internet trolling won’t change that.  &gt;The question these guys want to ask more than anything is, “If women like sex so much, why aren’t they having it with me?” They just can’t bring themselves to say it outright, because that opens the door to the endless despair they’ve locked away.  ...And I think I've reached my limit.  Part of the problem is that after decades of second-wave man hatred and fathers/husbands portrayed like Homer Simpson, we take misandry so for granted that you don't even notice it anymore.  My husband had to point out to me how *painfully* misandric many commercials are, and almost all commercials on during the day (to play to stay at home moms)",™

t5_2qh2p,BatsArentBugs,1317320052,"It's a non-profit.   When going door-to-door, in the rare case that someone takes a book/magazine, official policy is to mention that ""this"" campaign/work of going door-to-door is made possible by donations. The most likely scenario here is that the person gives nothing or a dollar. I saw a guy give a $50 donation for a leather cover JW Bible.  However, the majority of donations come from JWs in the local congregations. There are boxes in the Kingdom Hall (what JWs call their church) and you drop in whatever you can donate. These boxes aren't passed around like a collection plate - they're glued to the walls on the sides or in the back of the building (the lobby-ish area). The money is gathered after the meeting is over and two JWs have to count it, sign a receipt, then send it to Watchtower Headquarters.   Most donations are small - $1, $5, $10. The most I've seen at once was a check for $500. There are two meetings a week. I'd say the donation total after each meeting is in the range of $0-150. That's only for one congregation. Some Kingdom Halls have more than one congregation. I'm not going to do the math, but you can see how it adds up.   Bethel is what the JW Headquarters in New York is called. There is a Bethel for each country in which JWs have a presence.  The main headquarters is in New York, though. Bethel is staffed by JW volunteers. They live there and get free meals. I believe each volunteer (at NY Bethel) gets $50 a month, regardless of position or duties.  Every couple of months, there's an article in the Watchtower suggesting that JWs can help out financially with stocks, an inheritance, etc.  Some dude on a ex-JW forum told a story that he left the JWs, and his mom didn't leave him an inheritance. Instead, she gave it to the JWs.  These are some of the ways that I know they keep costs down and profits up.   The official picture is ""Oh, we're small and the only True Christians™ doing God's work and we couldn't survive without your donations and barely break even."" Being poor was good enough for Jesus, but not them, apparently. Bullshit. Fuck the Governing Body.",™

t5_2qjxn,AISim,1317334954,"Here is the section about it from the letter if you want to know. &gt;Jamie was a dean of music in a university, who had surreptitiously been meeting with other faculty members for sÃ©ances which he said regularly produced levitation of objects. He and his wife were visiting his sister who was an aunt of one of our group, so we arranged a couple evenings together, at his sister's home. We interlocked our hands on the surface of an 18lb. wicker table, and hardly had the lights been turned off before the table rose toward the ceiling causing us to stand and the shorter ones to stand on tip toe. JL was our photographer; but the flash caught the top of the table and Jamie's body had cast a huge shadow where we didn't want it. We planned the next try carefully; I was to leave the table after it rose, and insert a flash bulb in a remote flash unit, I would then reenter the group and count out the oscillations of the table, with even numbers when the bottom of the table would show , and when I started counting Jamie was to sit down and pull back from the area. JL was to take the picture on some even count. It worked, except that Jamie held his hands protectively in front of his face and the pictures showed on table leg almost as if he hadn't yet let go of it, and in my reaching over the others I had let my thumb fall below the edge of the table. As evidence it seemed clear that he and I might have been supporting the table. The table then turned up on edge, and landed softly upside down between Jamie and the camera, and there was no picture to show that. Many much more glamorous incidents have been reported by others, but remember that I'm telling only my personal experiences, and this, with other phenomena not photographed or outlined here makes me classify this as most probably true levitation. (We had other controls that night that eliminated Jamie as a willful manipulator, and it had gone on for some time when I was not even touching the table.) Look at the picture!",©

IAMA Senior BoA Client Service Specialist, and for the benefit of my fellow redditors, I'm going to post a few points from our general-issue talking points regarding this change.  (Off the record, I will say that I'm not happy about the new fee, but it's very likely that most banks will be instating something similar in the coming year or so.)  **Why are we charging customers for using their debit cards?**  * The economics of offering a debit card have changed with recent regulations.   * Like many other banks across the industry, we are choosing to charge a fee so we can continue to provide a payment vehicle that offers convenience, control, security and utility.   * Bank of America will begin charging a $5 debit card purchase monthly fee in early 2012. Customers have told us they want us to be clear and fair about fees, and introducing a debit card purchase monthly fee is consistent with our decision to move away from penalty fees and toward charging fees for services customers choose to use.   * A number of our competitors are assessing or testing debit fees  **What is the debit card purchase monthly fee?**  * The debit card purchase monthly fee is charged when making PIN or signature-based point of sale purchases in-store, by phone or online. The fee will be triggered by the first debit card purchase within a statement cycle and will appear on the customer’s bank statement the following month.  * Electronic and recurring payments/ACH transactions made using the debit card number will trigger the new fee. Recurring payments made using a checking account number will not trigger the new fee.  * If a customer does not use his or her debit card for purchases in a given statement cycle, they will not be charged a debit card purchase monthly fee for that statement cycle.  * Customers will only pay the $5 fee once per statement cycle, regardless of how many debit card purchases they make or how many debit cards they have linked to their account in a given statement cycle.   **Will all customers or account types be charged a debit card purchase monthly fee?**  * No, the debit fee will apply only to consumer products (not small business) and will not apply to all account types.  * The following consumer account types will not be subject to the fee:  o Platinum PrivilegesTM customers, where available  o Bank of America Premium accounts, where available  o Advantage (Model); Prima® (CA): Preferred (NE)  o Merrill Lynch Wealth Management® clients with qualifying balances  o U.S. Trust® clients  o Campus Edge®  **How will existing customers learn about the new debit card purchase monthly fee?**  * Existing customers will learn about the new debit card purchase monthly fee through communications beginning in early 2012. Impacted customers will receive notice in writing at least 30 days before the new fee goes into effect for their account.   Also of note: ""Some of our competitors have announced their intent to charge or test debit fees: such as Wells Fargo, Chase, SunTrust, BB&amp;T and Regions.""  On behalf of all of the decent human beings who work here, I sincerely apologize for your trouble, redditor BOA clients.  Hopefully this at least helps clarify what's going on.
