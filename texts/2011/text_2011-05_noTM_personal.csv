t5_2qm4e,Deckardz,1304302896,"((*My message was too long so I'm breaking it down into two comments*))  **I *cured* my own allergies, myself and no longer get huge allergy attacks or need to constantly take antihistamines.**   I used to get what seemed equivalent to the flu or a bad cold each pollen season, with runny eyes, headaches, feeling woozy, sinus infections from all the mucus, etc...     Since I started ""curing"" myself, I now have no or very minimal responses during allergy season.  Once in a while I might need to take a Zyrtec for 2 or 3 days, but that's about it - and with 2 allergy seasons per year, this means only once every few years this happens.     I've heard about local honey, too.. but: yes, **there is a theory and it worked for me.  It's called [The Bucket Theory](http://www.dustfree.com/allergys.htm)**.     When I first came upon this theory I immediately thought of another analogy that seems to make more sense than that of our immune systems being a bucket overflowing when ""full"": an animal trapped in a corner©.  *(what the heck, I might want to write about this one day)   Our bodies get to a point where they're like an animal trapped in a corner, surrounded by potential enemy combatants to the point where they're feeling so threatened that discernation is bypassed and our bodies basically ""say"" to antigens: ""one more of you come near me and I'm going to lash out at you with full force"" ..and so benign pollen comes along and fills up our mucus membranes and our immune system goes bezerk on it.       Of course, if our immune system were stronger, it might be more relaxed against this, just as a big athletic guy would feel comfortable around more potential combatants than a small scrawny guy might.  That's where I think *exercising* our immune system might come in and that is the relationship between people who were raised in or spent a long time in very clean environments having more allergies than those who grew up exposed to more of the environment (""eating some dirt"" from time to time).  Of course, chemicals could also be responsible.    If a cat was just chillin in a corner (SureIllDrawThat, where are you?) and it saw a rat it might have fun playing with it for a while and maybe kill it.     If it saw 4 it might kill them, then relax.     If it saw 10 it might get nervous thinking that one of them might be able to bite it while it was going after others, but wait to see if they were a threat before attacking (discerning whether they are bad or not).     If it saw 30 rats and it was cornered, it might try to keep them back by lashing out full-force at any that came near, in hopes that it would scare the others away and keep them at bay .     So, with one or even a few, the cat can just chill and take out the rats if it wants, but when there are a lot, it doesn't even have the luxury of evaluating whether each individual rat is hostile or hungry and might want to attack.  It must assume they're all hostile because the cat realizes that A. they can overwhelm the cat in numbers so it must terrorize them, and B. they can out-sustain the cat by continuing to come at it until the cat is too exhausted to continue defending itself.     That's my own interpretation that I think it actually more accurate than the bucket theory, and based on this, it makes sense to eliminate all toxins to our body because our immune system and cleansing system (I forgot the correct word for this - liver, kidneys, etc...) all together can become overwhelmed.     The steps I took are in the comment to this comment because the whole thing I typed was too long (*I got the message ""this is too long (max: 10000)""*).  ",3209,479,0,0,1,1,©

(for reference, here are the recommended specs for EVE from the official website)  &gt;CPU: Intel Pentium® or AMD dual core @ 2 Ghz or greater which supports SSE2  &gt;RAM: 2 GB  &gt;HD space: 6gig Free Space  &gt;Network: ADSL connection or faster  &gt;Video: 256 MB Shader Model 3.0 Graphics cards such as GeForce 8 class card or higher, ATi 3000 series or higher and Similar chips from other manufacturers.  Now I can't honestly offer much input. I've run EVE on my desktop from a dual@3.2 and an  Nvidia 8800GT, to my current rig: quad@3.3 and an AMD 6870. I was always able to get consistent fps on high settings, if I recall correctly. Though this was from Trinity~Apocrypha, and reportedly some people have been getting ever-increasing FPS issues with patch after patch. I've also never been in a gigantic # ship battle, so I don't have much experience to speak of for there.  This response ended up longer longer than I intended... Hope I was able to help in some fashion.",12232,908,0,0,1,1,®

t5_6,kelana67,1304658517,"The fate of glyphosate in the environment is also not as benign as once thought. It's true that glyphosate either binds to soil or is broken down quickly by microbes. Glyphosate binds to any positively charged ion in the soil, with the consequence of making many nutrients (such as iron and manganese) less available to plants. Also, glyphosate stays in the soil bound to particles for a long time and can be released later by normal agricultural practices like phosphorus fertilization. ""It's not uncommon to find one to three pounds of glyphosate per acre in agricultural soils in the Midwest,"" says Huber, noting that this represents one to three times the typical amount of glyphosate applied to a field in a year.  Huber says these facts about glyphosate are very well known scientifically but rarely cited. When asked why, he replied that it would be harder for a company to get glyphosate approved for widespread use if it were known that the product could increase the severity of diseases on normal crop plants as well as the weeds it was intended to kill. Here in the U.S., many academic journals are not even interested in publishing studies that suggest this about glyphosate; a large number of the studies Huber cites were published in the European Journal of Agronomy.  If Huber's claims are true, then it follows that there must be problems with disease in crops where glyphosate is used. Huber's second letter verifies this, saying, ""we are experiencing a large number of problems in production agriculture in the U.S. that appear to be intensified and sometimes directly related to genetically engineered (GMO) crops, and/or the products they were engineered to tolerate -- especially those related to glyphosate (the active chemical in Roundup® herbicide and generic versions of this herbicide).""  He continues, saying, ""We have witnessed a deterioration in the plant health of corn, soybean, wheat and other crops recently with unexplained epidemics of sudden death syndrome of soybean (SDS), Goss' wilt of corn, and take-all of small grain crops the last two years. At the same time, there has been an increasing frequency of previously unexplained animal (cattle, pig, horse, poultry) infertility and [miscarriages]. These situations are threatening the economic viability of both crop and animal producers.""   ",-3,7,0,0,1,1,®

t5_2qh1f,thoomfish,1304911719,"Since you mentioned keyboard shortcuts, here's another thing I like about OS X over Windows and Linux: OS X has 3 modifier keys that all do drastically different things. The Command key is for issuing commands, the Option key modifies the result of a command (including regular keystrokes, allowing easy entry of common alternate glyphs like é and ©), and the Control key is mostly used for UNIX-y stuff (like the system-wide Emacs keybindings in text fields).  In most Linux desktop environments, you only really have the Control key doing anything useful, with Alt being occasionally useful, and the Windows key largely vestigal (though Unity in Ubuntu Natty is changes that. I like their use of the Windows key quite a lot). These mappings stumble over themselves in Terminal use, because you expect Ctrl-C to copy, but instead it sends an interrupt signal to the currently running program -- in that one app you need to use Ctrl-Shift-C instead.  Windows spreads out things between the Control and Alt keys pretty evenly (and with no particular pattern that I've been able to discern in my decades of Windows use). Most commands are done with the Control key, but some are done with Alt, like Alt-F4 and Alt-D, just to fuck with you. The Windows key is useful occasionally, but more often annoying, since accidentally tapping it steals the keyboard focus and requires you to take action to get back to where you were.

t5_2cneq,KobeGriffin,1304972932,"Really nice response; thank you.  Where to begin… ☺  One very difficult problem which arises when discussing socialism, and specifically the Marxist brand, is we very quickly run out of parallels to the real world. In fact, the closet thing to socialism, as Marx understood it, which exists in the world today are the democratic socialist states, and those are clearly not the classless utopias which he envisioned.  Marx envisioned socialism as a transition period from capitalism to communism in which members of the working class control the means of production such that they provide for the needs of themselves and the outstanding members of the state (young, weak, sick etc.).  This is a society in which different skill sets, interests, and occupations exist, but from which the social class divisions which have arisen (naturally, Marx would even admit) Nowhere in the world has such a system ever existed.   Because of this, it becomes difficult to talk about what things would look like under this system (arguably, this is because the logical progression of history has not reached the stage where humans can comprehend such a system, because if we could, it would be implemented), and so it is difficult to find the proper terminology to describe just what a pure socialism would look like in terms we can recognize. Thus, I used the term “state” and the Greek “demos” to get across the point that socialism does not require that the state be in control as I initially stated, but that in Marxist socialism there is such a revolutionary change that the state is recognizable. This has lead to much confusion, which I think is unneeded   Specifically, Your problem seems to be on the basis of an equivocation of the terms ""state"" and ""demos"". Then you say stuff like this:  &gt;So, socialism only requires economic planning by the demos, but because anarchy is anti-state, it is also anti-socialist?  First, yes, anarchy is anti-state, but it is not anti-Marxist state, but anti-oligarchical, anti-monarchical, anti-capitalist *et al* state. Anti-traditional state. Because of this link, it is also not necessarily anti-socialist but really only anti-state in a way close to how a Marxist is anti-capitalist: they both a redefinition of social mores (any self-respecting anarchist would be anti-social democracy for instance). In this way, socialists and anarchists both want revolution, it is just different in what they want to impose. To properly quote me, and make the comparison obviously ridiculous, you should have replaced state with demos in both the places where I used it:  'So, socialism only requires economic planning by the demos, but because anarchy is anti-demos, it is also anti-socialist?'  Of course, it is not the case that anarchy is anti-demos (it is not anti-""people of the state"" directly, only opposed to their oppression as members of the *polis*). By that statement, I meant to imply that anarchists are anti-organized compulsory collective action when it is called the state, and so anti-socialist state as it is understood in the modern sense. Surely, such a thing can only be called a state, and thus where it exists an anarchist would reject it.   &gt;If we go by a definition in which it's possible for there to be an alternative to central planning, then syndicalism, or certain forms of market socialism, or certain types of social anarchy (or most likely, more than one of the above) would not qualify as centrally planned.  Did you mean not qualify as socialism? Actually, those organizations would qualify even for a strict Marxist. Marx didn't care as much about the particulars of the organization, so long as their function allowed the people to work for themselves. He could have stood a state, he just didn’t think it would look anything like what the anarchists rebel against.  My definition was that :  &gt;Socialism is an economic system in which the means of production and distribution of goods are centrally controlled by the state.  This you called discombobulated or wrong, both of which are much too strong. In fact, this was not the strict Marxist definition which I alluded to in this post, but is much closer to the modern accepted “government hooks everybody up model” especially regarding the distribution of goods. When you say that I am wrong or close to it are you denying that a state controlled economy is an essential element of many socialist theories?  You also wrote of my definition in a previous post  &gt;One that I don't know of a single socialist who ascribes to.  Which I would say is very surprising: not a single socialist you know thinks of vesting the state with control of the economy as essential to their goals? This is certainly part of the zeitgeist (“Obama is a socialist because he nationalized GM!”), and the actions of socialist states (Venezuelan oil first comes to mind). Are you suggesting that I made this definition up? I assure you, I am not that good.  The funny thing about this dialogue is that I just don’t seem much of a difference  Between your definition and mine.  Here is your definition:  &gt;...socialism [is] an economic system in which the means of production and distribution of goods are democratically controlled  Here is mine:   &gt;Socialism is an economic system in which the means of production and distribution of goods are centrally controlled by the state.  Then I later said:  &gt;As I have said consistently: socialism requires only economic planning by the demos. This can happen with any level of organization, and so long as it is collective, it is socialist.  Which seems to be literally your position.  I chose to use demos interchangeably with state a few times simply because the Marxist state is much further from our modern conception of state, and much closer to a group of dudes working at a factory with no boss.  It seems like you are flaming me. What gives?  ",14123,71,0,0,1,1,☺

t5_2fwo,anvsdt,1305062798,"&gt; I'd indent how your editor would but with any implied parens removed.  The point is, it's more the pain of indenting it properly than matching the parens. If I have an expression `* x y\n\t+ z w` that means `(* x y (+ z w))`, and then I want `+ z w` on the same line of `* x y`, I'll also have to remember to put the parens. Then they *would* become annoying. Much like the automatic semicolon insertion in JS, it seems useful, but causes more problems than it solves.  &gt; If your example was a little saner, I'd try it. (Not that I'm in the habit of working in pure lambda calculus(?))  Well, yes, it was *a little* too much. It was the first thing short and complex enough I could find. Sorry about that.  &gt; And you still have that tree structure, it's just defined by indentation as well as some parens. You just edit with enter/tab/backspace instead of ""("" / "")"".  I have code indented like a tree, not a tree.  &gt; The former, that's where you pasted it,  I actually meant `(* x x (+ 4 ...))`. I know *precisely* what some code will mean when I paste it between parentheses. There it is ambiguous. It can mean three different things, the editor cannot always guess how I meant to paste it. The fact is, the implicit closing parens are all after the dedents, so the code is more like:      (define (f x)        (* x x      | )) ; or ) | ) ; or )) |  Where | is the cursor. The problem *does* exist, else no one would ever complain about Python code being a pain to paste.  &gt; if you want the latter indent before you paste. Just like you'd need to specify by exact position if you had parens.  That's error-prone. I can see the parens (I actually don't, since I just move to the end of the list using, again, some structural editing mode to get), but I can't see indents/dedents.  &gt; So delete sqrt and insert it before let, you could easily have the editor maintain the indentation automatically on the rest of the block:  That's a trivial transformation's trivial case. It quickly gets more complex. (p.s. your `let` doesn't work; p.p.s. you still need parens around the whole `let`)  Also, the editor should add/remove parens accordingly to make the code mean what it is meant to mean. That's a needless complication for me, you would care more about the parens now than before. Yes, it would be easier to read for non-Lisp people, but it would be harder to write.  &gt; (Unless you mean with macros, in which case, the underlying structure is the same so any macro will work fine regardless of syntax.)  I'm talking about editing and fancy source code transformation, they are equivalent to S-expressions. (if you look at them as syntactic sugar for them, like `'expr ↔ (quote expr)`, else it would break `code=data` and you'd need a special indentation-sensitive data structure)  Also, again, opinions.",7743,122,0,0,1,1,↔

Modern termite treatments are now so effective that significant damage is rarely an issue. Repair bonds are written so as to exclude previous damage and conditions caused by the homeowner; and were created when the most effective chemical (Dursban), had a very short half life. ""Repair Bonds"" always state that ""live termites"" must be present. Even if the treatment was defective, the chance of finding live termites, after the inspector of your company has been there, is almost nil. There is very little chance that you will receive damage with a Termidor® treatment, and less of a chance that the money you spend on a repair bond will pay off, if you do.  Long time bar and restaurant employee. There is a good chance that one or more of the following has taken place: The liquor in your drink has fruit flies in it, the fruit is old, not washed before being cut, not cut on a sanitary surface, and may have rolled around on the cooler floor before making its way to your drink. The straw from your drink has been touched by the filthy hands of bartenders and servers umpteen times. Roaches have likely walked on your glass and straw. The ice in your drink was probably left overnight, and may have been used to store bottles of beer, wine and liquor before arriving in your glass. In the state where I live (Florida) health inspectors never seem to darken the door of bars, so all bets are off when it comes to cleanliness and food safety.  Bar Auditor: If you are smart and dishonest, you can work as a bartender and make major money stealing under the nose of the bar owner. Even bars with cameras and standard ""inventory systems"" do not have the ability to catch the real pros. The only truly effective system employs auditors who use bar code scanners, scientific scales, and compare usage to sales. If your bar begins using a service with this system, move on to a different bar that doesn't have it. Most bar owners have no clue how to determine who is stealing.   ",50693,6466,0,0,1,0,®

t5_2qq9h,mutus,1305491818,"[15 seconds of Googling led me to this blog post from a year ago... ](http://scienceblogs.com/terrasig/2010/05/dichloroacetate_dca_brain_canc.php)  &gt; DCA has been around for a long time and has been used in people with inherited diseases of mitochondrial metabolism. In 2007, a group at the University of Alberta led by cardiologist Evangelos Michelakis demonstrated that very high doses of DCA can slow the progression of human tumor cells grown in immunocompromised rats. The response to this story was unbelievable with internet marketers popping up to sell the simple chemical and conspiracy theorists saying that because DCA was cheap and not patentable, no drug company would ever develop it, it was being kept a secret, and so. In truth, the work was in very, very early stages. &gt;  &gt; This didn't stop hopeful patients from seeking out DCA sellers even though DCA can be contaminated with other related substances that are far more toxic. And in the most egregious case among these DCA purveyors, an Edmonton man who purported to sell DCA online was recently arrested in Phoenix and pleaded guilty to five cases of wire fraud - not because he was selling DCA but rather a white powder comprised of some combination of sucrose, lactose, dextran, and starch. &gt;  &gt; Yes. Not even the unproven DCA. Fake DCA. &gt;  &gt; The best coverage of the DCA story was put forth by my blogging colleague, Orac at Respectful Insolence, who wrote over 20 posts on issues associated with the previous study and the internet marketing of DCA. At the bottom of [this post](http://scienceblogs.com/terrasig/2007/10/dichloroacetate_dca_phase_ii_t.php) where we wrote about this trial beginning, there is a list of links to Orac's posts as well as eight or nine of our own. &gt;  &gt; This week, the Michelakis group has published [a follow-up paper](http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/2/31/31ra34.abstract) in Science Translational Research that includes laboratory experiments with cell lines isolated from cancer of 49 volunteers and a phase I trial of DCA in five patients with advanced glioblastoma who were also receiving a standard anticancer drug temozolomide ([Temodar®](http://www.temodar.com/temodar/index.html)) and radiation therapy.... &gt;  &gt; ... &gt;  &gt; Since I cannot yet access the paper, I wish to direct you to [a superb and approachable review](http://scienceblog.cancerresearchuk.org/2010/05/12/potential-cancer-drug-dca-tested-in-early-trials/) of the latest findings written by Dr Kat Arney at the Cancer Research UK blog, Science Update. The four closing paragraphs of her article include modified verbiage that Cancer Research UK has been using in patient information content about DCA since 2007: &gt;  &gt; &gt; It is clear that DCA is an intriguing drug - one of many currently being investigated by scientists around the world. It will be interesting to see the results of more extensive lab-based experiments and larger clinical trials of DCA. And cancer cell metabolism is certainly a productive area of research that we're actively funding. &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; **The fact that DCA is off-patent is no barrier to its development as a treatment for cancer. For example, Cancer Research UK has secured a licence for an off-patent drug called fenretinide, which could be used to treat rare childhood cancers. And there is certainly no ""conspiracy"" by pharmaceutical companies to prevent research into DCA - there is just not enough evidence at the moment to support its widespread use to treat patients.** &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; While these results are intriguing, it is unlikely that this one compound represents ""the cure"" for cancer - and it is also unlikely that DCA is the ""wonder drug"" that the headlines portray. Cancer is a complex and multi-faceted disease, and it can be caused by a range of different faults within the cell. It is unlikely that any single drug could ever treat all forms of the disease. &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; There are many promising new treatments for cancer currently in development, funded by organisations across the globe - including Cancer Research UK. If anything, these new results show why research is so important in bringing safe and effective treatments to people with cancer - they don't provide definitive answers, but they support further investigations which may yield benefits for patients in the future. &gt; &gt; Pharmaceutical chemist Dr Derek Lowe who blogs at In The Pipeline also has [a nice post](http://pipeline.corante.com/archives/2010/05/14/dca_and_cancer_more_results.php) on his perspective.",6605,1037,0,0,1,1,®

t5_2qhx4,texmo,1305509647,"At the same time, it is highly probable that sprinting-evoked, systemic AMPk activation simultaneously curtails an individual’s natural genetic propensity for fat-storage as well. This is because, in response to the rapid ATP-depletion prompted by those repeated, maximal-intensity bouts of anaerobic expenditure, AMPk also works to curtail Acyl-coenzyme A: diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT1) activity and glucose uptake into adipocytes. This saves ATP for energy repletion rather than having it be ""misallocated"" to synthesize new triacylglycerol (TAG) in your adipocytes (21, 22, 23). I desperately want to write something witty here, but—to be perfectly honest—the above dynamic still strikes me as so miraculous that it generally tends to leave me at a loss for words whenever I go back and re-conceptualize it. But, trust me, it’s ""pretty good"" to have this going on, which just goes to show how potent a physique-shaping force sprinting can be when it comes to furthering your bodybuilding goals.  Unfortunately, due to space constraints, that’s going to have to do it for this installment of sprinting examined ""Avant-style."" In next issue’s Part II, I’ll be returning to take a look at sprint technique and methodology, different strategies for incorporating sprint-work into your lifting split, and also harkening on emerging aesthetic trends in the realm of contemporary bonsai-gardening. Or maybe I’ll just throw in a few supplement recommendations. I don’t know; I’m still a little undecided on that last part. But until then, I’m off to the races, off with the hope that you’ll all soon follow. Cheers all.    References Cited:  1.

t5_2qh03,Kerafyrm,1305647811,"&gt; BioWare releases another misogynistic jaunt into the Mary Sue world of 'the witcher.' There is hardly anything of substance to recommend this train wreck to a discerning connoisseur of RPGs. Every element of its design can be described as 'embarassingly awkward.' Animation, art direction, dialogue, writing, combat. It's a list of sad mediocrities as long as your arm. The fact of the setting and characters being a shameless copy of Michael **** classic Elric of MelnibonÃ© series aside, the game itself behaves like a confused child. Does it want to be a brawler with peripheral RPG elements? Or an action RPG with brawler combat? In either situation the designers have failed to deliver on both satisfying combat or a compelling story that ever rises above the juvenile. You certainly won't find it making shallow sex simulators based on plagiarized fantasy novels.…  This is how reviews would sound like if BioWare developed Witcher 2, even if the game were exactly the same.",60267,19187,0,0,1,1,©

[Feline Diabetes.com](http://www.felinediabetes.com/) was a huge help. After reading up on it I was sure we could reverse Dude's condition. We immediately changed his diet to grain-free wet food only. Blue Wilderness wet is perfectly acceptable for that. Maybe your kitty will eat that since he had the Blue dry before. That's what I was feeding Dude when he got diabetes. (I don't blame the food, he is huge and slightly overweight.) We tried the BW wet but he won't eat it, so we went with Wellness grain-free wet. The other things you said about diet were spot-on, especially the ""treats"" of human food. Those MUST stop forever right now. That's not to say he can't have *any* treats. Just stick with grain-free ones. Now you might be thinking, ""How and where will I find grain-free cat treats?"" There are some brands out there, but not very many...until you look in the dog food section. That can be a huge help. Just because the package has a dog on it instead of a cat doesn't mean your cat can't eat them. You have to look for treats that are soft enough for a cat to chew and if they are bigger than you want, cut or break them up. Stay away from treats that are the consistency of semi-moist cat food. Those have a lot of sugar in them. I stick with single-ingredient freeze dried meat treats. I give my cats [these,](http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.jsp?productId=4406466) [these,](http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.jsp?productId=3678515) [these,](http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.jsp?productId=11147080) [these,](http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.jsp?productId=4280382) [and these.](http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2751598)  Now, for food. I already mentioned the Wellness wet. Merrick is another good brand for this too but the Duder doesn't really like it. You're probably better off steering clear of the prescription food. Look at the ingredients in them and compare it to BW, Wellness or Merrick and you can easily see which is the better quality food!   ➡➡➡➡➡**HUGELY IMPORTANT THING!!!**  Get a glucose monitor and test your cat at home. You *can* use a regular glucose monitor for humans, but you *MUST* first take it to the vet's office with you and check your meter against theirs to see by how many points your reading differs from theirs with the same blood sample. There is a slight difference in the reading you will get with one made for humans and one made for pets, but if you know what the variance is you can get along fine with the $20 human glucose monitor instead of the $100 pet one.  I know this is a huge long post, but there's a lot to learn and quickly so you take the best care of your cat. Just remember there is hope here...I know you must have been freaked out to hear ""diabetes"", but is absolutely IS true that if it is caught early enough it can be reversed with diet and glucose monitoring. I did all of these things with Dude.  You wanna know how long he had to take insulin before we were sure that he went into remission with the diet changes?  TWO WEEKS!

t5_2qtp5,majeric,1305844844," Sometimes ya have to call a spade a spade. It amazes me to the degree by which you are arguing against something when the cold hard facts are staring you in the face.  You're engaging in rationalization. Not reason. You're coming from the perspective that ""discrimination against women is no longer a problem"" and there for there MUST be some other explanation for it. So you're working hard to show that it isn't discrimination. You're trying to reverse engineer an argument.  But you're not backing up your view. You're not giving me facts. You're not showing me how statistics can be skewed in this context (Your argument about race is just uncomfortable).   I understand the nature of sample size. I have taking university level statistics. That's why we have margins of error. Are you really suggesting that the margin of error in this context is in the 10s of %? The study was about 4379 roles in movies. That's not a small sample size. Sure I an accept that there's a skew in the focus of the 100 or so movies but that unto itself is demonstration of bias. I just simply have to show that the top 100 movies each year for the past 50 years have a heavy male bias. The focus of the 100 movies each year is a part of the discriminatory bias.  the following is a quote from the study:  &gt; Three separate findings support this claim. First, only 29.9% of the 4,379 speaking characters across the 100 films coded in study 1 are female. These findings are strikingly similar to the results we found examining over 15,000 speaking characters (27% are female) in 400 G, PG, PG-13, and R rated films released between 1990 and 2006 as well as 6,833 speaking characters (27.3% are female) in 150 Academy Award® Best Picture nominated films from 1977 to 2006.   Two more sets with sample sets that are much larger and span a larger time frame. The study's conclusion is supported by other findings.    The evidence is clear.  Why are you so bothered by the idea that women are still discriminated against? It's not like society transforms over night and suddenly it's equality for all. We still have work to do. There's still things that need to get better.  ",106461,24202,0,0,1,1,®

One of our single-most-trusted sources is our universities, and maybe the new york times and a few science journals, simply because of it's journalistic review and unbiased authoritative position. If you don't know the source there can be a lot of liberties taken with the material. If you know the source and they do have a bias, expect they are using it.  ie : [fhsc](http://www.sweetsurprise.com/) Do we trust this campaign? Why? They are quoting universities... We don't (or we shouldn't) trust them because of the editorial review. This is a big deal right now and it's important.  To answer your question if a university published it, I trust it more. If McDonald's publishes it, 'it is bought and paid for' because they have editorial review. They choose what is said, how, and by whom. That is the difference.

t5_2qnw8,franzlisztian,1306156054,"**TL;DR**: You can either do technical work, or learn smoke on the water.  First off, I recommend getting the book, [A Pianist's Problems](http://www.amazon.com/Pianists-Problems-William-Newman/dp/0306802694), and reading Schumann's advice for young musicians [Download](http://www.mediafire.com/?uxts1yvw191qi4b) [Online Copy](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/28219/28219-h/28219-h.htm)  There are two paths you can choose.  You can choose to go through a tough rout of technique exercises, or play progressively harder pieces.  The first path is long, arduous, and tiring.  You will not sound good to yourself or anyone around you for several months at least. This path consists of plenty of scales, octaves, and technical exercise regimes to build technique, muscle memory, and strength.    Pros: * You'll be able to play some pretty beast stuff in the end  Cons: * You'll sound pretty terrible at first.  Risks:  * Tendinitis * Roommates gutting you and/or setting your piano on fire  Recommended Repertoire: [Czerny Practical Exercises for Beginners](http://imslp.org/wiki/Practical_Exercises_for_Beginners,_Op.599_%28Czerny,_Carl%29), [Czerny's ""The Young Pianist""](http://www.8notes.com/czerny.asp)  Later on, * ""100 Progressive Studies without Octaves"" Opus 139 (Levels 3-7) At a similar level to the above. You could add this one in after you have done the first few pieces in the above. Exercise 3 starts 8th notes and exercise 9 starts 16th notes, so it goes quite a bit faster than the above books.  * ""125 Exercises for Passage-Playing"" Opus 261 (Levels 8-10) * ""30 New Studies In Technics"" Opus 849 (Level 8)  The following books are for building advanced dexterity and velocity: * ""The Preliminary School of Finger-Dexterity"" Opus 636 (Level 9) * ""The School of Velocity"" Opus 299 (Levels 8-10) * ""The Art of Finger Dexterity"" Opus 740 (Level 10)  Then, the Hanon Exercises, and later on, the Liszt technical exercises.  The second route will also be long.  You might get some short term pleasure out of it though. This consists of playing progressively harder pieces, as opposed to lengthy technique regimes.  Pros: * You won't sound like a machine  Cons: * The pieces are simply terrible, usually  Risks: * Giving up, because you can't play what you want  Recommended: Music by the Fabers, specifically their [Accelerated Piano Adventures® for the Older Beginner](http://pianoadventures.com/publications/mainLibraries/pa/accelerated.html)   Either way, getting a teacher (a RL one, not some internet teacher) is highly, highly recommended.  There are many techniques of piano that can only be taught in person.  Practice tips:  * Play everything REALLY SLOWLY at first * play each piece a bit at a time, instead of all at once * Practice does not make perfect, perfect practice makes perfect. Play it slowly enough so that you can hit every not correctly. * If you or your hands get tired, take a water break  General Suggestions for Repertoire, by Period:  Baroque:  * [Bach, anna magdalena notebook](http://imslp.org/wiki/Notebooks_for_Anna_Magdalena_Bach_%28Bach,_Johann_Sebastian%29) * [Bach Inventions](http://imslp.org/wiki/15_Inventions,_BWV_772-786_%28Bach,_Johann_Sebastian%29) Classical: * [Fur Elise](http://imslp.org/wiki/F%C3%BCr_Elise,_WoO_59_%28Beethoven,_Ludwig_van%29)  Romantic:  * [Chopin Prelude in A (Opus 28, no 7, ""The Polish Dancer"")](http://imslp.org/wiki/Preludes,_Op.28_%28Chopin,_Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric%29)  Contemporary:  [Satie Gymnopedies](http://imslp.org/wiki/3_Gymnop%C3%A9dies_%28Satie,_Erik%29)",3372,2007,0,0,1,1,®

I am truly interested in this stuff.   &gt;And to call me a dope for providing insufficient information, while you blatantly and callously ignore the fact that even one person has died, is disgusting and reprehensible.  1 person committed suicide. It's sad, and definitely a mental disease, but I can't mourn for everyone who dies on the earth. Have you ever seen the movie Happy Gilmore?

It was the only possible explanation I could come up with for your blind ignorance without outright insulting you  I like how you think, not trusting the internet or google results, but I dont' think it matters where you are.   Your theory, while just a theory, isn't entirely possible and you have seriously given me something to think about. I will see if the results vary at all from the US, because there is google.co.il or whatever, and it looks at least different.  &gt;that doesn't seem to be the explanation either based on your self-imposed censorship to information that is being shoved right in your face.  This is a peculiar thing for you to say.  My face is in it right now. I live in an Arab town. Everyone I meet and interact with here is Arab. There are Jews around but they are in cars or just stopping in and leaving.   Don't you understand how weird it is for someone who's thousands of miles away on their computer to shove information in my face? Wouldn't I be better off asking people and seeing with my own eyes?

Again, facebook is not your fight club memo book.  * And finally, that guy who is *constantly* posting obscure band's music videos on people's wall, taking credit for the band's talent and hard work. ""Hey I found these guys, you've never heard of them but I have, check them out."" Pretty much any direct wall posts are just asking for attention.

The following was provided by an AK expert gunsmith:""I recommend to all users of such a rifle to stop using commercial Sellier&amp; Bellot 7.62x54r and any other heavy ball such as the Bulgarian, Russian or German 54r. The rifle is not designed to EFFECTIVELY handle such rounds and almost everyone having problems that I have seen and fixed in the shop were due to shooting this stuff. They just beat the living hell out of those bolts even with the pin relief cut-out in the rear trunion. The gun is designed to use a STANDARD military 54r with a 147-158 grn bullet. This is a safe range of the 54r standard round to go by when using this rifle. I own a PSL and have never had one problem with it. It is a joy to shoot, quite accurate and the long stroke gas system is surprisingly smooth. I have fixed a wide array of problems for many people, but I must admit that more often than not they were brought on by the operator. Trust me, I have seen some screwy things fall out of the inside of the bolt assembly which I could write pages on, some really hysterical.  Don't get me wrong, I don't want to deter anyone from enjoying their PSL. Just follow this advice, and you should be fine:  1. Use military 7.62x54r ball  2.

When you think of them like having a ""fast"" and a ""slow"" lane, this influences your driving behavior subconsciously for worse.  It is frustrating as fuck, rightly so, when there's three cars on a three-lane highway pulling a on-time-for-work-clockblock on you.

Notice here that I may not calling for a game company to always keep in house dedicated servers alive, although there is some stance to say that if you shut down a games in house dedicated servers, a patch should be pushed to allow stand alone dedicated. Keeping a multiplayer platform alive is a great way to make money, though. In the case of Blizzard, having people, even people who aren't the first sale, use battle.net is a huge boon for them. Getting people used to a specific gaming platform you fully own is fantastic for business.

t5_2qj1l,Hadouken16,1306734178,"I swear I'm not a grammar nazi, but this just recently came up in another discussion and thought it was relevant:  **Which is correct as the plural of LEGO:** 'Lego' or 'Legos'? Neither, actually. The word 'LEGO', when used as a noun, should only refer to the company that makes the product. Otherwise 'LEGO' is supposed to be used as an adjective. Thus, when referring to the pieces, neither 'lego' nor 'legos' is correct... rather one should say: 'LEGO bricks' or 'LEGO pieces' or whatever (using LEGO as an adjective -- and one should really capitalize all of the letters, and put the little 'circle-R' symbol after it (®)). This is all a matter of protecting the trademark of 'LEGO' for the company (using it otherwise degenerates the strength of the trademark). This is not to say that I use the word correctly 100% of the time... but that's the answer to the question (it's always fun/painful to read the near-flame-wars that start at slashdot.org over this topic... and generally, both sides are wrong).

t5_2r0gj,tsukiko,1306769786,"It seems that pretty much all of their points may apply to the LDS Church itself:  &gt; ""Church members should not participate in groups that:  &gt; 1) Challenge religious and moral values or advocate unwarranted confrontation with spouse or family members as a means of reaching one's potential.  Oh, so members shouldn't be confrontational with family members that aren't members or believers? Even if it is for ""reaching one's potential"" as a ""celestial family"" forever?  &gt; 2) Imitate sacred rites or ceremonies.  Oh, right. Mormons never imitate. Except when told, ""Do as I'm doing"" in all sorts of rituals that are mostly borrowed imitations themselves.  &gt; 3) Foster physical contact among participants.  Whew, I guess that cuts out that part of the Endowment ceremony then. Also baptism by immersion, priesthood blessings, ordinations, and all sorts of Churchy® things.  &gt; 4) Meet late into the evening or in the early-morning hours.  Following this would cut: 4:30am temple visits—like when we went as part of youth groups—early morning seminary, night institute classes, EFY, and all sorts of youth activities.  &gt; 5) Encourage open confession or disclosure of personal information normally discussed only in confidential settings.  Fast and testimony meeting anyone? It seems that most members spill the beans for all sorts of personal information that they would not do elsewhere. Also, don't worry about meetings with bishops. Meeting with bishops is completely confidential... until they talk to other people about it.  &gt; 6) Cause a husband and wife to be paired with other parties.""  Like Joseph Smith or others marrying women who were already married? Polygamy in general since it uses singular forms of husband and wife? Men who are sealed to more than one women? (A modern-day edge case of Polygamist practice in Mormonism.)  &gt; We strongly counsel against affiliation with any such group and warn against believing any claim of Church approval, tacit or otherwise, by any private organization offering ""experiential"" or ""empowerment"" training.   We strongly urge you that the church is a group to be warned about. We give you all these rules to follow, but you should *only* apply them to other groups. Not us, because we are good. We're good because we say so. Amen.  Edit: Added the bit about priesthood blessings, etc. under the touching point",846,1,0,0,1,1,®

t5_2qjvn,Double0zero,1306783609,"Ayeaye captain is right ‘She might no be ready to face it head on’  To me it sounds like she still has issues with what happened to her, I can relate. One way I thought I dealt with the exact same issue was ‘alone time’ it’s not dealing with it at all its just distancing your self from ever really dealing with it.   The thing about her not being able to fully commit, sounds to me just to be a sense of control, having been in a situation where you have none, to have final say on a commitment would feel somewhat comforting to her perhaps. I wouldn't see this as a problem if I were you, you are together, in a serious relationship, you are both aware. What’s the need to make things ‘official’ for everyone else?  Regarding the letter I think this is a really good way to communicate, it has worked for me. So be open and honest before giving it to her, make it her decision. Explain you have been unsure how to approach the situation and that the letter might make her sad, but I would say you want to be there with her (at least in the same house) if she wants to be alone to read it that’s fine, but be there for her for when she needs a cuddle afterwards.  The not deserving to be loved bit – tell her all the time how much you love her, when she’s doing things you love point them out. Make her blush ☺ even the silly things. If she wears make-up tell her how beautiful she is without it and how absolutely stunning she is with it on. Tell her you love her for the person she is on the inside, don’t be shy with it.. A past SO of mine did this for me – he was basically teaching me to love myself, which in the end was the best thing anyone has ever done for me.    Throwaway-o really? Why not? Maybe because helping others, generally being a nice guy rather then a dick will get you much further in life. In fact to anyone who’s said ‘she’s broken’ ‘needs to be fixed’ come on, a lot of the time people who have been through the shit, are stronger, more well rounded humans. They have seen the floors in humanity and as a result are often charitable and caring then the rest of us. And presides, this girl is in what appears to be healthy loving relationship, she cant be that broken, half the ‘healthy’ population have issues with maintaining one of those. PleaseH3lpM3 she told you about her past, this means she is dealing with it, she is 80% ‘fixed’ it may take time, time if you are there for her during the process, it wont back fire such as cheating or self destruction. Even if your relationship doesn’t work out in the long run you will have made a life long friend and she will appreciate all your doing (even if that’s just sitting, listening) for the rest of her life.

I also have problems with how birth control has been used to prevent ""undesirables"" from having children. I don't have to take my history as a morality play. I understand there have been contradictions and hypocrisies in the past just as there are today, even among people, organizations and movements I admire.   I was just acknowledging that even something I consider an active force for good in the world (birth control) can be used for ill.
