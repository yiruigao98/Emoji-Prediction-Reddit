t5_2qh2p,EvilWooster,1314853794,"The Word of God  Lyrics and melody © 1994 by Catherine Faber  From desert cliff and mountaintop we trace the wide design, Strike-slip fault and overthrust and syn and anticline. . . We gaze upon creation where erosion makes it known, And count the countless aeons in the banding of the stone. Odd, long-vanished creatures and their tracks &amp; shells are found; Where truth has left its sketches on the slate below the ground. The patient stone can speak, if we but listen when it talks. Humans wrote the Bible; God wrote the rocks.  There are those who name the stars, who watch the sky by night, Seeking out the darkest place, to better see the light. Long ago, when torture broke the remnant of his will, Galileo recanted, but the Earth is moving still. High above the mountaintops, where only distance bars, The truth has left its footprints in the dust between the stars. We may watch and study or may shudder and deny, Humans wrote the Bible; God wrote the sky.  By stem and root and branch we trace, by feather, fang and fur, How the living things that are descend from things that were. The moss, the kelp, the zebrafish, the very mice and flies, These tiny, humble, wordless things---how shall they tell us lies? We are kin to beasts; no other answer can we bring. The truth has left its fingerprints on every living thing. Remember, should you have to choose between them in the strife, Humans wrote the Bible; God wrote life.  And we who listen to the stars, or walk the dusty grade, Or break the very atoms down to see how they are made, Or study cells, or living things, seek truth with open hand. The profoundest act of worship is to try to understand. Deep in flower and in flesh, in star and soil and seed, The truth has left its living word for anyone to read. So turn and look where best you think the story is unfurled. Humans wrote the Bible; God wrote the world.  This song was inspired when a friend of mine complained to me about a run-in with some Creationists, and asked ""what can you say to such people?"" The first words that popped out of my mouth were ""humans wrote the bible. God wrote the rocks.""

After a time on testosterone your facial features will (most likely) change a great deal into a much more masculine shape. I've been on T for about 5 months and I've already had a LOT of changes in my face. Given time, being on T will change your facial structure.  As for shoulders, the best thing I can imagine would be to just work out. If you lift weights, swim, or even run, you'll gain a lot of muscle mass. Guys naturally have more muscle mass than girls....so being on T will make developing muscle easier. It won't magically give you muscles and bigger shoulders, but it will help in the process of gaining them.  Plus, working out is good for you...and is infinitely cheaper than surgery.  As for hips, you can't change the major bone structure of that just by being on T or working out.... But I do know there is a surgery  called Body Masculinization. Here is a quote about it: ""ManSculpture ® Body Masculinization is commonly performed at the same time as FTM Top Surgery ®.

His business partner got a 64 gig model with all the options.  They've been going back and forth on the phone as they try them out.   The biggest complaint my boss has is the lack of 3G connectivity.  All the release info stated they would have ""Bluetooth®, WiFi and 3G connectivity"" so my boss expected to be able to pop the SIM from his other tablet into it and get going.  Not the case however, the sim card pops right in but the tablet doesn't see it.  Apparently there is some confusion on this, several vendors had 2 different part numbers for each of the 3 models at release but the 3G doesn't seem to work on any of them (verifiably does not work on the ones my boss and his business partner got their hands on).  [Lenovo community forums](http://forums.lenovo.com/t5/ThinkPad-slate-tablets/3G-upgradable/td-p/515331) seem to indicate that the 3G-capable model won't ship until October, but they certainly didn't make that clear initially.   Other than that, after it gets online and runs updates it's pretty slick (it was running a little slow until updates completed, had my boss ready to send it back).  Like others are saying the handwriting recognition is pretty amazing, very accurate and snappy with an intuitive interface (circle text for context menus, scribble over text to erase, just what I figured out playing with it for a few minutes).  The general OS interface is nice but I'm not sure if this is specific to lenovo as this was the first time I got my hands on a Honeycomb tablet.

t5_2cneq,ArticlePaster,1314941184,"**Lawsuit accuses security guard of handcuffing first-graders for talking in class **  By Joel Hood, Tribune reporter  August 31, 2011  The attorney for a family suing Chicago Public Schools over the alleged handcuffing of a first-grader in 2010 said Tuesday that the boy was among several 6- and 7-year-olds who were detained and handcuffed for hours for talking in class.  In an email to the Tribune, attorney Michael Carin said school officials at Carver Primary School on the Far South Side authorized the on-campus security guard in March 2010 to discipline some first-graders who were being disruptive.  Giving details not disclosed in the lawsuit filed Monday in Cook County Circuit Court, Carin said the school's security officer removed the students from class and held them in another office on campus where there were no other adults present. Carin said the students were handcuffed for hours and told that ""they were going to prison and would never see their parents again.""  ""There appears to be no reason for an officer to isolate 6- and 7-year-old children, place them in handcuffs and threaten them for hours during a school day, or any other day,"" Carin wrote.  Carin said the Chicago Board of Education had ignored attempts to resolve this case outside the courtroom.

""We hope the Chicago Board of Education acknowledges its responsibility and resolves the matter quickly.""  In the complaint, the boy's mother, LaShanda Smith, describes the guard's action as ""reckless"" and said her son suffered injuries both ""permanent"" and ""personal"" during the incident. Smith, who is seeking more than $100,000 in damages, accuses the officer of acting ""in conscious disregard"" of her son's safety.  CPS, along with the Board of Education, are defendants in the case.

In August 2010, part of the Petermann Glacier about four times the size of Manhattan island broke off , prompting a hearing in Congress.  Researcher Alun Hubbard, of the Centre for Glaciology at Aberystwyth University, U.K., told msnbc.com by phone that another section, about twice the size of Manhattan, appeared close to breaking off. In 2009, scientists installed GPS masts on the glacier to track its movement.  But when they returned in July this year, they found the ice had been melting so quickly — at an unexpected 16-and-a-half feet in two years — that some of the masts stuck into the glacier were no longer in position.  Hubbard, who has been working with Jason Box, of Ohio State University, and others, said in a statement issued by the Byrd Polar Research Center that scientists were still trying to work out how fast the glacier was moving and the effect on the ice sheet feeding the glacier.   **'Really weird' **  But he said he was taken aback by the difference between 2009 and 2011 when he visited the glacier in late July.  ""Although I knew what to expect in terms of ice loss from satellite imagery, I was still completely unprepared for the gob-smacking scale of the break-up, which rendered me speechless,"" he said in the statement. ""I'm very familiar with the glacier. It's very hard to sort of envisage something so big not being there ... to come back and basically see an ice shelf has disappeared, which is 20 kilometers across (about 12 miles) ... I was speechless and started laughing because I couldn't sort of believe it,"" Hubbard added, speaking to msnbc.com.  ""It was really weird when the helicopter first came over,"" he added.  Hubbard told msnbc.com that he had gone to the glacier to recover instruments used to monitor the glacier and time-lapse photographs.  ""What I saw there is this ice shelf is riddled with rifts and cracks. You can see another big rift another 10 to 15 kilometers (6 to 9 miles) back into"" the glacier, he said. Hubbard said the large rift, which the researchers have dubbed ""The Big Kahuna,"" was getting bigger. He was cautious about predicting when it would create a new vast ice island, but said it could happen ""maybe next year, something like that.""  **'Abnormally warm'**   He said while sea glacier's ""calving"" of ice bergs was a natural process, they were witnessing something out of the ordinary.  ""The break-off last year is bigger than anything seen for at least 150 years,"" Hubbard said.  ""This region (northern Greenland) is experiencing temperatures which are abnormally warm ... I think the far northwest of Greenland is seeing a kind of new regime of climate,"" he added.  The Humbolt Glacier, the widest in the northern hemisphere, is also retreating, Hubbard said. He said he was not a climate scientist, but said the pattern of ice melting in the area was ""a definite consequence of climate change and global warming.""   Writing in the Annals of Glaciology journal, published on Aug. 22, the researchers said Greenland's glaciers had collectively lost 592.6 square miles of ice between 2000 and 2010.   The August 2010 ""calving"" event saw the creation of an ice island of 112 square miles, causing the Petermann Glacier to retreat by about 8 miles.   The island contained enough water to keep the Delaware or Hudson rivers flowing for two years or to provide the entire U.S. with tap water for 120 days, Andreas Muenchow, professor of ocean science and engineering at the University of Delaware, said at the time.  The Byrd center statement, which summarized the journal report, said while this loss of ice was ""extreme compared with others ... it is part of a larger pattern of ice area loss concentrated in north Greenland.""   Twice as many glaciers are retreating as the number that are advancing, and the area of ice lost was nine times the amount gained, the researchers found.   **'Harbinger of many changes'**   At the Congressional hearing in August 2010, the then chairman of the Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming, Rep. Edward Markey, said the melting of the Greenland ice sheet was ""but one harbinger of the many changes to come.""  ""Scientists, skeptical by both nature and training, always urge a dose of caution when looking at any one event as evidence of climate change,"" he said in his opening statement. ""This level of professional skepticism is what makes the overwhelming scientific consensus that climate change is real and caused by man all the more powerful.""  Markey listed extreme weather events, such as a record-breaking heatwave and drought in Russia, extreme floods in Asia, record-breaking temperatures on the Eastern Seaboard of the United States and ""mega storms and floods"" in many parts of the country.  ""Take a step back from these individual pieces and we see a mosaic that could not be clearer. Our world is becoming less hospitable with every passing year,"" he added.  © 2011 msnbc.com Reprints ",175,1,0,0,1,1,©
t5_2r9vp,ShowPig,1314948988,"If you still have him- my family has rehabilitated countless wild animals (including baby squirrels) and I thought I would put in my two cents.  I'm going to be upfront with you, he might not make it. He's pretty young (he looks about 5-6 weeks old) and with the bleeding from his nose/mouth area he likely have internal bleeding. He could have fallen or been attacked by another animal. The best you can do is make him comfortable tonight and do a few things that could potentially save his life, if he hasn't been injured too badly.  [Here's a website that tells you how to keep him warm without hurting him](http://www.squirrelworld.com/ifounda.html), which is important since he's so young he won't be able to maintain his temperature as well. There is also a lot more info on this website so I would give it a read.  For now though, set him up so he's being kept warm. In the meantime keep him covered, maybe in a towel, loose enough he isn't being squished.   ""Very important to keep the baby warm.  This means an outside source of heat.  Putting the baby in a cardboard box with just a towel is a sure way to kill the baby.  If the body temperature drops and is low for any period of time, the organs start to shut down, then death. Ideal temperature for source of heat is 98.5 degrees.  Allow for the baby to cuddle up to heat source, giving room to back off if he/she gets too hot."" Don't try to feed him until he is warm again.  Get a washcloth and wet it with warm water (not hot, test it on the inside of your arm first.) Wipe the blood off of his face because if it blocks his nose he could have trouble breathing.  He is also at an age where dehydration can be fatal very quickly. The website puts it better than I can- ""Use a 1c.c. syringe (without the needle) by mouth.  To rehydrate, use Pedialyte® or if nothing else Gatorade®.  Warm a small amount to luke-warm temperature.  The amount per feeding will vary according to age of baby.  A good starting point is 1/10th of a 1c.c. per week of age every hour for 12 hours. 12 hours is usually long enough to rehydrate the baby squirrel.  This also allows the baby to get used to the syringe and if he/she aspirates anything into the lungs, it will be absorbed with less chance of developing pnumonia.  Go very slowly until he/she gets used to the taste and the syringe.  If you have stuff bubble out the nose or he/she snorts through the nose, you are going too fast or the baby is having problems swallowing.  Take your time.""  Put him in a quiet, dark place, where he won't be bothered. He's probably pretty stressed out and small animals can die of stress- I've seen it happen before and you don't want to. Don't pick him up or move him around more than you have to. Baby squirrels at this age aren't aggressive and probably won't bite in self defense but always be cautious. He could also have broken bones so be very mindful and delicate with him when you move him.  This guy might not be a good candidate for survival so don't be too hard on yourself if he dies. They're really vulnerable at this stage in their life because they're old enough to wander out of their nests but they can't fend for themselves so they do things like fall out of trees onto concrete or get picked up by predators. If nothing else you can assure he dies in his sleep in a warm nest instead of being hit by a car or dying of exposure.  Just make him comfortable and warm and try to get some fluids in him. The hardest part is the first night. Good luck and there needs to be more people like you in this world.  ",2326,284,0,0,0,1,®

The topic was a familiar one to the insurance industry, but it was now becoming a major political issue as New Labour committed itself to reducing the 2.6 million who were claiming Incapacity Benefit (IB). Amongst the 39 participants was Malcolm Wicks, then Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Work, and Mansel Aylward, his Chief Medical Officer at the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP). Fraud - which amounts to less than 0.4 per cent of IB claims - was not the issue.     The experts and academics present were the theorists and ideologues of welfare to work. What linked many of them together, including Aylward, was their association with the giant US income protection company UnumProvident, represented at the conference by John LoCascio. The goal was the transformation of the welfare system. The cultural meaning of illness would be redefined; growing numbers of claimants would be declared capable of work and 'motivated' into jobs. A new work ethic would transform IB recipients into entrepreneurs helping themselves out of poverty and into self-reliance. Five years later these goals would take a tangible form in New Labour's 2006 Welfare Reform Bill.’…….     …..‘In the 1980s Unum - along with the two other major life and accident insurance companies, Provident and Paul Revere - had been doing well from providing 'own occupation' income protection schemes for mainly upper income professionals. Insurance against loss of earnings caused by accident or sickness was seen as a lucrative market with strong growth potential. Profit for insurance companies mainly lies in the revenue generated by investing the monthly insurance premiums, and interest rates were high so the companies enjoyed high levels of profitability; they monopolised the sector by sharing a similar disability income policy that offered liberal terms.    Two factors threatened future profits however. The first was falling interest rates, and the second was the growth in new kinds of 'subjective illnesses', for which diagnostic tests were disputable. The old industrial injuries were giving way to illnesses with no clear biological markers - Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (ME) or Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS), Fibromyalgia, Chronic Pain, Multiple Sclerosis, Lyme Disease. In the early 1990s the new kinds of claims began to rise just as interest rates fell: profits were threatened. Unum's 1995 'Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Management Plan' sounded the alarm: 'Unum stands to lose millions if we do not move quickly to address this increasing problem'.4    ‘It was actually Provident [UNUM] that was quickest off the mark, introducing an aggressive system of 'claims management' that would become the industry norm. It could not influence interest rates, but it could reduce the number of successful claims it paid out. Its Independent Medical Examination (IME) was skewed in favour of the company through the work undertaken by its claims adjusters and in-house doctors.     Illnesses were characterised as 'self-reported' and so thrown into question. Only 'objective' test results were accepted. Some disabling conditions were labelled as 'psychological', which made them ineligible for insurance cover beyond 24 months. Doctors were pressured to use the 'subjective nature' of 'mental' and 'nervous' claims to the company's advantage.   Specific illnesses were targeted in order to discredit the legitimacy of claims.     The industry drew on the work of two of the Woodstock conference [‘Malingering and Illness Deception’] participants, Professor Simon Wessely of King's College and Professor Michael Sharpe of Edinburgh University [PACE Trial CBT/GET Researcher] , in an attempt to reclassify ME/CFS as a psychiatric disorder.  Success would allow payouts to be restricted to the 24 month limit for psychological claims and save millions of dollars. By 1997 Provident had restructured its organisation to focus on disability income insurance as its main business. It acquired Paul Revere, and then in 1999 merged with Unum under the name UnumProvident.……'  ",3,1,0,0,1,1,©

t5_2cneq,Not_Joking,1315250010,"I did not read this article.  Only the title.  The title alone begs me to talk to you.  Begin with 300,000 people.  Sounds like a lot of people.  I wouldn't want to be alone catering for that many.  Also sounds like not so many people.  Hospitality industry site CatererSearch.com estimates Burger King has roughly 340,000 employees worldwide.  Even with the full staff of Burger King behind you, you cannot stand just around Washington DC and expect to Have It Your Way®.  What about the extrapolated Isreal to United States figure, 12.9 millon people?  Well that's a bigger number.  Not as large, mind you, as the 24.5 million people reported to have been watching *Friends* on September 27th, 2001, but large enough.  I'm asked to imagine about 13 million people going to Washington DC marching for change.  But is that a real parallel?  I've got Google Maps set to 50mi scale on [Israel](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=google+maps+israel&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=31.28794,35.804443&amp;spn=4.280558,9.316406&amp;gl=us&amp;t=h&amp;z=7&amp;vpsrc=6) and [New Hampshire](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=google+maps+united+states&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=43.882057,-71.268311&amp;spn=3.792703,9.689941&amp;gl=us&amp;t=h&amp;z=7&amp;vpsrc=6).  They look about the same size to me.    Now, I'm from NH and I know that there's a difference between me going to an event 3 hours away, way up in Berlin, NH, and my going to an event, say, in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Namely, I could go to a march in NH as long as I can afford about $75 for gas and tolls, and get a day off from work.  I cannot afford to go to New Mexico, a solid 38 hour drive away.  For myself, and too many other Americans, this trip would mean missing rent or mortgage payments, probably losing their job.  A 13 million person march on Washington is an incongruous analogy.   Never mind that, let's say that number of people, 13 million, do go to Washington and shuffle about protesting for change.  Since they are coming from all over the US the average travel expense is going to have to be *at least* $200 per person.  So 13 million people collectively spend $2.6 billion dollars to protest.  Before you say that I'm missing the point, wouldn't a 13 Million person march have a tremendous effect on government policy, I'll answer you now.  Yes, yes it would.  As a strictly practical matter, if 13 million people actually decided to go to a protest in Washington right now, we would experience an immediate and unmistakeable shift in policy.  Highways around the country would be blocked by tanks.  The eastern seaboard radiating out from the capital would be a network of roadblocks and outposts.  Nationally, air travel would be restricted, almost curtailed.   In roadblocks and home invasions the people on a list of potential terrorists would summarily and without civility be detained indefinitely with no right to stand accused.  All major cities would be under curfew.  The shock of this to the American people would be completely pacified by the American business-as-usual media.  In fact, things will look bringt right away, because those pesky unemployment numbers are quickly remedied hiring more homeland security forces.  More buying power!  Main street America on it's way to recovery!  If 13 million people march on Washington, we push for the endgame.  We lose.  Let's overlook that.  A huge protest on Washington.  13 Million peaceful people with signs and talking points.  Cacophony.  A few coherent themes.  In a protest, the protestors aren't really looking for the attention of the government.  The government is aware, they just don't care.  The protestors are looking to get the attention of the public, to directly appeal to their countrymen, and earn their support.  13 Million people voting won't elect them a President, and a president alone is a weak gambit to play opposting an entrenched corpocracy.  They want public support.  Too bad.  They can't have it.  You are still reading.   You are ahead of the curve.  Most people get their reality from mainstream media.  If it's not on TV, it didn't happen.  If it is, then that's exactly how it happenned.  No if's ands or buts.  We cannot reach these people by having a march.    And involve them we must.  We have to have at least their vote, if we want to maintain a democracy.  And we do.

If a university wants to be assessed, what are the steps to be done?  and receives this response:  &gt; It very much depends on which particular ranking you are referring to. The subject rankings are based on a survey of academics and employers and citations per paper. Qualifying institutions have to be producing a threshold level of research in the discipline and offer programs therein. The first and most important step is to make sure you are listed. For this you can write to Baerbel Eckelmann on baerbel@qs.com – she will check your records and make sure you have access to our data system QS Core.

t5_2rbms,raynejarre,1315375231,"Sure! It can be a bit hard to explain, but lets break it down a bit. To start out, you have two ""Heavy"" Desktop environments, two ""Light"" desktop environments (There are more, but lets just stick with the major ones), and then a vast majority of Window Managers. Also, I recommend looking at the ArchWiki. Even if you are not using Archlinux, it is by far one of the better linux Wiki's out there, and most of the information fits across distributions (For example, the [Desktop Environment](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Desktop_Environment) document)  When we talk about a desktop, we generally think of a Desktop Environment. A Desktop Environment contains several applications, which when combined, make a full desktop suite. Of these, Gnome and KDE are the most popular, probably followed by XFCE, then LXDE, and then quite a few others (Such as myself, or the crunchbang distribution) who decide to mix-and-match to make something of their own.  [Gnome](http://www.gnome.org/)- ""GNOME is an international community dedicated to making great software that anyone can use, no matter what language they speak or their technical or physical abilities."" Gnome is what came in Ubuntu pre-11.04, and was quite popular for quite a long time. It contained the gnome-panel, which allowed you to add panel applets, used the Metacity window manager, the Nautilus file manager, Gnome-terminal for a terminal emulator. It aimed to be simple and intuitive, while maintaining customization. Recently, it updated to version 3, which has split the community slightly. Several people criticize Gnome 3 for being less customizable. In my personal experience, I don't entirely think this is true, but it is at a very new state, so many features are not yet implemented. In the newer version of gnome, panel apps can be found in the form of gnome-shell-extentions, which are similar to the panel applets from gnome 2, but a bit more flexible. I honestly think that in time, Gnome 3 will be better. However, I feel it currently lacks a bit of polish. Some will disagree with me  [KDE](http://www.kde.org/)- ""The KDE® Community is an international technology team dedicated to creating a free and user-friendly computing experience, offering an advanced graphical desktop, a wide variety of applications for communication, work, education and entertainment and a platform to easily build new applications upon. We have a strong focus on finding innovative solutions to old and new problems, creating a vibrant atmosphere open for experimentation."" - KDE Attempts, much like gnome, to create something that is open, flexible and easy to use. It has a strong following as well (Though, much like gnome, had a lot of community dischord with the move from KDE3 to KDE4). KDE has strengths in that it has a lot of applications that come internal to KDE, which provides a lot of continuity between the applications, however, KDE is often criticized for the QT+ framework it runs on, as it adds additional bloat for some users (For example, with KDE, you will need the QT runtime for the KDE applications, and will likely run into the GTK runtime if you needed a GTK application, such as GIMP, LibreOffice, etc.) This makes some edge away from KDE.  You can find a good comparison between KDE and Gnome [Here](http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/kdegnome)  [XFCE](http://www.xfce.org/)- ""Xfce is a lightweight desktop environment for UNIX-like operating systems. It aims to be fast and low on system resources, while still being visually appealing and user friendly."" - For a long time, XFCE was the lower-end computer's Desktop Environment of choice. It is light on resources, and quite snappy because of it. In addition, XFCE is Stable, both in the fact that it has few bugs, and in the fact that it hasn't really changed a whole lot over the years (Unlike how gnome recently decided to revamp itself). It runs off GTK, like gnome, and is favored by quite a few people. Some people however feel it is harder to customize it to the extent of Gnome. You can decide for yourself, there is a ton of screenshots [here](http://www.xfce.org/about/screenshots) and [here](https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=84840)  [LXDE](http://lxde.org/)- ""The ""Lightweight X11 Desktop Environment"" is an extremely fast-performing and energy-saving desktop environment"" - LXDE aims to be lightweight, and modular. It uses the Openbox window manager, and has several internally developed applications for various things (Such as the lxterminal terminal emulator, and lxappearance to change GTK themes). Because of its modular nature, it allows you to pick alternatives a bit easier. However, it is also a bit harder for people who are not interested in tweaking to pick up, especially things like the application menu.  As for [Window Managers](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Window_managers), there is a ton of options. Basically, a window manager does just that. It manages your windows. Nothing more, nothing less. It allows your to resize windows, provides that little close button, allows your to move them, and thats it. Generally, window managers are used as alternatives for the window manager that already exists in a desktop environment (For example: Metacity is the default gnome Window Manager, however several people replace it with Compiz. This is what gives you the pretty window effects and such). There are a few different types of window managers as well - Tiling, Stacking, and Dynamic. Stacking is what you are likely used to, Tiling will automatically tile your windows ([here](http://gigamlol.deviantart.com/art/AwesomeWM-Desktop-27-01-75753423) is an example of a tiling window manager (Awesome) with 3 windows), they take some getting used to. And dynamic window managers, which do both.  Generally, unless you like tweaking a lot of things, or enjoy reading and learning a lot, you probably would want to stick with a Desktop Environment, as they are much quicker to set up to a working state. Sorry much for the wall of text, and hopefully this was useful to you. Everyones ideal desktop is a bit hard to pin down, as everyone has a different thought on what looks nice, and what is functional to them. Personally, I often can't make up my mind and switch through several. I tend to enjoy the lighter desktops more (I usually either run the Awesome window manager, Openbox+Tint2(Known as the ""Crunchbang"" configuration), LXDE, or XFCE. This is because I use linux on my Netbook, and I like it being very snappy. At any rate, let me know if you want any more info. I will be happy to provide it :)  (P.S.: Also, check out [This](http://linux-news.org/?p=2413) link. It is another overview of the various Desktop Environments.)",230,1,0,0,1,1,®

t5_2qh1i,PlatonicTroglodyte,1315421324,"I think most of us answering here are Athiests or Agnostics, but for clarification, I, too, am an Athiest.  My answer to the creation conundrum is a belief in the overwhelming force of balance. I wouldn’t say that I consider “Balance” to be a supernatural force, but merely a fundamental order that relates all things. While there is no evidence I find convincing for the existence of a higher power, I do see an abundance of evidence that all things eventually work out an equilibrium. From the Hindu concept of karma to the Daoist concept of yin yang, from Hegelian Dialectics to Newton’s third law, we humans have noticed an inherent desire in all things to reach a state of equilibrium with nature. These things have been noticed and widely accepted in religion, science, and philosophy, implying a widespread, albeit often subconscious, belief in such a system.  Now, how do I fit balance in the creation of the universe? Well it’s a bit too complicated for me to fit into words but I’ll see how well I can do with the sparknotes. Most of the people who have an issue around the Big Bang Theory are troubled with the ‘ignition’ part. Who or what started it? For me, I use suns as a model similar to this. For those of you who have never taken a course in Astronomy, suns are supported by a delicate balance (of course ☺) between gravitational pull and thermal pressure. The suns enormous mass naturally pulls in its own outer gases through gravity, but as it does so, the sun becomes more dense and the molecules heat up, and the resulting thermal pressure causes the gases to push away from the core. If we accept the unfathomable temperatures of the Big Bang, and that the rate of the universe’s expansion is slowing and objects are cooling, it is somewhat conceivable that all objects will eventually cool off enough to lose their outward momentum from intense thermal pressure and begin falling back into the universal center of gravity at the location of the last big bang. Once that happens and all matter again shoved into an incomprehensible dot, the molecules superheat and explode all over again, thus restarting the process.   There is no reason to suggest that we are in the first explosion nor the last. We forget that time is a human institution created to help facilitate our understanding, but sometimes, when you think about it, your mind can slip into a state where you can see everything as always happening constantly, and are not left to struggle with the impossible riddles of what came first and what comes next.

Strong expression of EGFR is common in lung cancer, and the EGFR gene is somatically mutated in a subset of tumors [55] and [56]. Thus, blockade of EGF, the ligand of EGFR, could affect tumor development. A human recombinant EGF-based vaccine has been developed (CIMAvax®), which is administered together with an immunoadjuvant [57], [58] and [59]. In a phase II study, 80 patients with stage IIIB or IV NSCLC who had completed first-line chemotherapy were randomized to receive best supportive care (BSC) or EGF vaccine therapy [58]. Each vaccine dose contained 50 μg equivalents of EGF and patients received the vaccine on days 1, 7, 14, 28 and monthly thereafter. Serum EGF concentrations were reduced in 64.3% of patients who received the vaccine, confirming that vaccination had provoked an immune-mediated decrease in circulating EGF. There was also a non-significant trend towards increased survival for vaccinated patients (n = 37) versus controls (n = 37), with median survival times of 6.47 and 5.33 months, respectively (p = 0.098). A clinically meaningful difference in survival was observed in vaccinated patients ≤60 years (n = 22) versus controls (n = 28), with median survivals of 11.57 and 5.33 months, respectively (p = 0.0124). No difference in survival was observed between vaccinated patients (n = 15) and controls (n = 9) aged &gt;60 years (p = 0.4382). Currently this vaccine is licensed in Cuba for use in adult patients with stage IIIB/IV NSCLC and approved for clinical trial development in the US. In addition a phase II/III trial is ongoing in Malaysia to assess the safety, immunogenicity and efficacy of the vaccine in patients with stage IIIB or IV NSCLC after conventional first-line chemotherapy [60]. The primary endpoint is overall survival.",620,186,0,0,1,1,®

t5_2shke,omegazero,1315499715,"**TL;DR: Probably can't make money with robotics.** &gt;""Does anyone recommend any books that describe how previous robotics startups formed and became rich?""  Name one major robotics corporation other than iRobot and Willow Garage that deal exclusively with robotics. Most are just research companies that professors started and they are NOT rich. They just get to play with interesting hardware.  iRobot? They built a platform that was hackable for hobbyists and provided a very real, consumer, function (vacuuming) as well as landing some government contracts early on. Willow Garage? [Look at their team](http://www.willowgarage.com/pages/about-us/leadership-team). They ALL have previous experience doing ridiculous things. TL;DR: Every one on that page has worked at highly respected places, e.g. Google, Yahoo, IBM, Stanford AI Lab. Robotics were NOT their first endeavor. [Here's a timeline of iRobot's history](http://www.irobot.com/sp.cfm?pageid=203). ""iRobot wins DARPA contract to build a tactical mobile robot, leading to development of iRobot PackBot®."" That's where real money is if you don't go consumer-level. It has to be government. No one else really wants robots yet.  One does not ""fall"" into robotics. It's not easy, and without any idea of how to program microcontrollers, move memory, bit twiddle, etc you're way out of your depth and breadth. You might be able to do all the physics calculations and kinematic models, but that's half the problem: there are just models. Most of that stuff doesn't work the same way in the real world, and finding CS-specific solutions (as it's usually hardware or software problems - e.g. precision of floating points) is difficult without previous knowledge.  I don't mean to overly discourage you, but the field is lean and new. The people doing research in it have years upon years of experience developing at major companies and universities. You can get into it, but to make a product that will make money -- I mean, you're dealing with entire teams of top-tier developers and engineers. You know your PhD advisor? Imagine an entire team of that person. Then have those people work on a single project.  Now, if you just want to mess around with robots and do some interesting research, that's a different thing entirely. If the goal isn't profit, sure, there are a lot of open problems. But as for getting rich with robots - best of luck.  I suggest learning C/C++ first, be able to solve a bunch of problems on Project Euler (and I recommend this because a lot of robotics problems are computationally hard, but if you can develop an efficient algorithm it eliminates the problem), and buy [Intro To Algorithms by Cormen](http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-Thomas-H-Cormen/dp/0262033844).

While I ♥ my Nexus S 4G and loathed giving it up for the Photon, I'm pleasantly surprised with how well the Photon performs.   There were some initial reports of slow 4G speeds, which I have experienced--slower than my Epic 4G or Nexus S 4G--but that should be taken care of in a patch.   As for display, I do notice vertical lines when the screen is powered off, but when it is on, the display is perfectly suitable. I don't think it is as rich as my Nexus S, but no real complaints. I find myself wishing it was brighter outdoors, but that could be the brightness settings I'm using.  Kickstand is great. :) Use it a lot. The camera button is handy but it takes a good 8 seconds for the camera app to load after launching via the button or the app shortcut.  Uhm..otherwise issues I've seen reported are intermittent random muting during phone calls (fixed in the last MR/software patch), random issues with 3G connections failing to reestablish after dropping a 4G connection (I've seen this a couple of times; flipping airplane mode on/off fixes it) and I've had one random power cycle. Otherwise, feels like a solid device and delivers a full day (~10 hours) of solid use.  It does have motoBLUR but I don't mind it. Some of the widgets are pretty handy like the social networking and photo cards.  edit: In terms of build quality, I really like the weight and feel of this device. The back cover is a soft-touch plastic that feels slightly rubberized, and the back cover snaps on tightly. I like it; but it is a more industrial feel.

t5_2sml9,limetom,1315554261,"Why should they care?  English spelling is completely out of touch with linguistic reality. If you ask many English speakers how many vowels there are in English, the would likely tell you five: a e i o u. But, if you define a vowel as a minimally contrastive unit as linguists do, most English speakers have anywhere from 13 (like many speakers in Los Angeles) to 16 (like many speakers in New York City or New Orleans' Lower Ninth Ward).   For example, we spell ""their,"" ""there,"" and ""they're"" different, and they mean different things, but they are pronounced exactly the same. Conversely, ""sow"" (a female pig) and ""sow"" (to plant seeds) are spelled the same, but they mean entirely different things and are pronounced differently.  Further, what punishment is there? In academic or business writing, one is socially obliged to write ""correctly."" Note that writing really is quite distinct from speech in English. You will almost never hear an English speaker use ""whom"" out loud, but in writing some might use it. But in a casual setting--on Facebook, while text messaging, etc.--these social pressures do not exist aside from people who decry the slow decline of ""proper"" langauge--which has been going on at latest since people started writing.  But I think you're missing an important point: these are quite often *creative* uses of language. Here's some examples of real, anonymous Facebook posts:  &gt;‎!!!!! That place is so good!  That's a lot of exclamation points. But they're being used for a reason: to express excitement in a way that cannot usually be expressed in writing.   &gt; ♥ transitivity/intransitivity  This is from a linguistics grad student friend. They're using the resources available to express something in an intentionally cute way. You can express ""cuteness"" in spoken/signed language with body language and other extra-linguistic things, but in writing, you have to do something like this.  &gt;ummm... TENGO QUE BAILAR!!!! 踊りたーい！！！ I need to dance!!! ...yea.  Multilingual creativity here. The Spanish is all caps and has lots of exclamation points. The Japanese has a 「ー」 (a *choon*) where it doesn't belong and exclamation points. Same with the English. (I think this person's Facebook style matches their speech; it is endearing.)

Different poisons do vastly varied things to animals, and some can slowly kill after just one good sized helping. We had a cat that got some lily in her one time and died more than 24 hours later. They might even be able to tell you what it was if you take a sample of poo/vomit and that could help narrow down the hunt.  As far as confirming your suspicions, if they won't talk to you then a hidden camera is your best bet. But before you do, slip a note under their door that you've SIGNED AND COPIED that states quite clearly that their son is not permitted to feed your dogs, ever, and by letting him do so they're aware that the police will be involved. For all they know, your dog has severe health problems. They should know their boundaries as neighbors whether innocent or guilty. And also, even if you do catch them on camera but still somehow can't prove it's anything other than innocent child's play, you can at least call the cops with a simple, ""Neighbors are giving my dog food after I told them not to, and now he's ill."" If you happen to get a pet loving cop, chances are you'll benefit from trying even if you don't have concrete proof of straight up poison.

t5_2qmg3,TrollyG-Yo,1315813356,"Okay, we'll break this down word by word for you in our ESPN Joke Review©.  So what was the original statement we're all discussing here?    &gt;HEY CHIEFS FANS, HALEY'S ALREADY COMPLAINING ABOUT THE SCORE BEING RUN UP THIS SUNDAY.  So why is this funny?  1) It's referencing Haley's past complaints when opponents have ""run up the score.""    After a bad loss to the Broncos last year he got snippy on the field with McDaniels.  This year against the Ravens, in pre-season, he similarly complained once again.  A lot of people at this time thought he was a little fucking nuts, because there's no such thing as running up scores in pre-season, it's all about practicing.  So this part is funny because it's referencing the past in order to make predictions about the future.  It's not as funny as the other parts, because this is more the ""set up"" to the joke.    2) It would mean the Bills would blow out the Chiefs.  Now, I wouldn't be surprised if these teams evenly split picks.  Half the (non-fan) people thought the Bills would win, the other half Chiefs.  But **no one** would have predicted the final score.  I'm sure most people thought it would be 17-24 or 21-10 or something.  This part is funny because of all the teams you think would blow-out Chiefs, *the Bills would not be one of them.*  3) Finally, it would also mean that Haley knew, four days in advance, that his team was going to lose, and lose badly.  And not just lose badly, but lose badly **to the Bills**.  I'm pretty sure most coaches expect their team to win.  Or if they're a realist they at least expect a close game.  This part is funny because it makes it seem like Haley is expecting to lose which is a juxtaposition of a typical coach's thoughts.    So in summation:  Aw fuck it I'm getting bored of this now.  I just thought it was funny that I predicted a blow-out is all.",4033,2956,0,0,1,1,©

The axioms are the one you need to justify for your problem at hand. (**edit**: It's like these logical proofs of the existence of God. They justify indeed that God exists within the axiomatic that they have built. Although you cannot argue against the conclusion that in their axiomatic system, the sentence ""God exists"" is a theorem, the justification of the axioms themselves is not a logical task.)

Bück dich befehl ich dir wende dein Antlitz ab von mir dein Gesicht ist mir egal bück dich  Ein Zweibeiner auf allen Vieren ich führe ihn spazieren im Passgang den Flur entlang ich bin enttäuscht  Jetzt kommt er rückwärts mir entgegen Honig bleibt am Strumpfband kleben ich bin enttäuscht total enttäuscht  Bück dich das Gesicht interessiert mich nicht  Der Zweibeiner hat sich gebückt in ein gutes Licht gerückt zeig ich ihm was man machen kann und ich fang zu weinen an  Der Zweifuß stammelt ein Gebet aus Angst weil es mir schlechter geht versucht sich tiefer noch zu bücken Tränen laufen hoch den Rücken  Bück dich  Bück dich befehl ich dir wende dein Antlitz ab von mir dein Gesicht ist mir egal bück dich nocheinmal  Bück dich  Unofficial Translation ©2006 Jeremy Williams.  Bend over, I command you turn your visage away from me I don't care about your face  bend over  A two-legged being on all fours I take him for a walk ambling along the corridor I am disappointed  Now he comes backwards towards me Honey stays stuck on the garter I am disappointed, totally disappointed  Bend over  your face doesn't interest me  The two-legged one has bent over  and moved into a good light I show him what you can do and I start to cry  The biped stammers a prayer because he's scared I'm feeling even worse he tries to bend over even more tears run up his back  Bend over  Bend over, I command you turn your visage away from me I don't care about your face  bend over once more  Bend over",6055,8978,0,0,1,1,©

t5_2qh2p,nnoo_way,1315904045,"&gt; Argument *ad populum*.  Incorrect application.  Fungible things like language *do* depend on consensus.  It's not like saying ""the Earth is flat because people believe it is""; it's like saying ""the word for this object is *rock*.""  &gt; how a single statement could, objectively, evince fallacious reasoning on the part of the speaker   I reason that you are not a human at all, but a tree frog who has learned to type.  &gt; I don't know how it could be any clearer.  You are VERY clear, that's not the issue.  The issue is that your personal definition of a particular concept differs from the prevailing definition of that concept.  The RationalWiki page *explicitly cites* the exact usage at hand in its explanation.  What you are talking about is closer to Moving The Goalposts, because for you, the triggering action is *changing* standards.  NTS is specifically about avoiding negative association through employing a rhetorical device.  This might be easier to see if we construct an example that meets your criteria but not NTS:  ""If something has property X, then I include it in group Y.""  ""This has property X.""  ""I don't count that because it also has property Z.  It must have property X *but not* property Z.""  NTS:  ""No *true* human being could do what Hitler did.  Hitler wasn't a human being, he was a monster.""  It is apparent to everyone that Hitler was, in fact, human; but the NTS tries to avoid taint by using something to exclude a member which does NOT in fact conflict with group membership.  Unlike the following example:  ""No TRUE Christian is an atheist.""  (Not a NTS because the criteria is actually correct, as we understand it.)  Now what you seem to be saying is that someone could have some wacky definition of Muslim that would make the OP's statement not a NTS; now the statement isn't *wrong*, because the claimant is using a different definition from the start.  In order for this to apply, you're assuming that the OP was NOT talking about Muslims as everyone else understands them, but was instead talking about a personal definition which for all we know meant a *Jain*.    In that case, then YES, it wouldn't be a NTS, BUT -- here's the catch -- even if the statement were preceded by what you designated as the necessary and sufficient clause to complete a NTS, it STILL wouldn't be a NTS!  Because ANY of the words he used could be secretly redefined to mean something else.  Maybe ""Muslim"" means ""nebula"" and ""peace"" means SKITTLES® and who knows what else.  You'd have to nail down *every* definition of *every* term if you want to avoid possibly miscategorizing ANY individual's statements.  Once again, this falls into the domain of semantics.  If we are going to use language in such a way as to be able to communicate with one another, then we are assuming usage under prevailing definitions.  And in that case, the OP is using a NTS.  Otherwise the OP is talking nonsense like a jive turkey. ",253,1,0,0,1,1,®

Windows is shit, because I had this laptop and it wasn't very good. 3. Windows is shit, because it can spawn processes that don't get killed when the parent exits. 4. OSX is ❤ MAGICAL ❤ and never has any problems!  Now let's go over those one-by-one:  1. If your work computer is unstable and your IT department won't fix it, they aren't very good. If you've got a leviathan app that just destroys your system - it's the application's fault, not Windows. There are badly-behaved applications that do this on all operating systems, including OSX. (Just try editing a big project in Final Cut Pro without occasionally needing to restart OSX.) 2. It's possible that the hardware retailer preloaded a bunch of stuff that you don't want/need - hence recommending a couple of apps to clean up the system (and as I've also pointed out in this thread, there are uninstallers and cleaners for Mac, so Windows is not unique.) Either way, it didn't sound like you really cared enough to try and fix your Windows machine. 3. This isn't a problem specific to Windows (which is why I said you were making shit up) - and there are badly-behaved applications on all systems. iTunes is one of them. mds/mdsworker is another legendarily buggy OSX background process. 4.

If whatever it comes up as looks the same as what libcaca has, then libcaca is doing the mapping correctly (cp437 0x01-&gt;Unicode codepoint 0x263A), but you don't like the particular Unicode font's approach to portraying that particular character.  You want a different font for your terminal, rather than a different terminal emulator; changing it to a font that looked like whatever the text mode on the graphics card that you once used had would give *you* the same effect, but not anyone else who ran your program in a terminal with different font settings.  Or you could do what you suggested above and go with SDL and write your own terminal layer and run as a graphical program -- Dwarf Fortress took this approach -- and *ensure* the look of the thing, but then you lose telnetability.  You can't, unfortunately, take a stock telnet connection and force the user at the other end to have a font that forces a particular appearance of a happy face, regardless of whether you're using utf-8 or cp437 encodings.  The character in each encoding just says ""gimme a happy face"", not ""gimme a happy face that looks like X, pixel-for-pixel"".  That's the font's job.  Hmm...well, maybe you could if you were using xterm...it [does support emulating some old graphical terminals](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/File:W3m-wikipedia.png), so as long as the telnet user is using a terminal type that supports graphics, you could push pixel-level graphics over the line.  However, few virtual terminals other than xterm support that, and I assume that that's not what you want.",83908,1274,0,0,1,1,☺

If an animation or cinematic shown during the start-up sequence runs longer than 20 seconds, it must be skippable using the START button or natural input.         For SONY  (applies to PS3 - disc, harddrive, patches and aditional content) &gt;[R181]  The title does not display blank, suspended, or unresponsive screens for longer than 15 seconds. Explanation: − A ""blank screen"" is a state in which there are no visual/audio cues to indicate that there is a game in progress. − A ""suspended screen"" is a screen in which the displayed image does not change. − An ""unresponsive screen"" is a state in which there is no response to user operation. This does not include demonstrations, or movies and conversation scenes that are included as part of the game's narrative. Loading screens defined in R180 are also not included in the definition of an unresponsive screen. − This requirement excludes situations in which the disc drive or internal HDD is malfunctioning, or the disc is soiled or damaged. If a blank, suspended, or unresponsive screen is shown for a long time for these reasons, this is not considered to be a violation of this requirement. − If a blank, suspended, or unresponsive screen will be shown over 15 seconds and may cause the user to think that a hang occurred, contact SCE via the PlayStation®3 Developer Network website (https://ps3.scedev.net/) for possible acceleration tips.

t5_2qh1i,putonasmile,1316047277,"From the other side’s perspective…… Personally, I don’t find your girlfriend’s request to be uncommon or unnecessary.  Firstly, and most importantly, because it is a VERY STRONG religious motivation.  Secondly, it’s reassuring for a girl to know that your relationship is NOT built off of physical lust, but rather true attraction to the heart and soul.  If you are getting this worked up over the fact that you can’t have sex with the girl you ‘love’, then maybe your relationship was previously built solely off of sex.  In my humble opinion, that in itself would be a good motivation to re-prioritize the reasons why you love her.   Also, be careful not to be sidetracked by the comment attacks on your gf right now.  Just because she is convicted in her religious beliefs does not prove she will be ‘crazy’ and ‘emotionally unstable’ in your future.  I also practice abstinence in my relationship (2+ years now, with a non-religious man- if he loves you, he loves YOU) and I don’t think that in any way impacts my personality or sanity….    Also, on a sidenote: depending on how old and mature you both are, there is no reason why a year of dating ISNT enough to understand that this is the girl you want to marry.  I know plenty of extremely successful couples who have gotten engaged after just a few months ☺   oh, and FYI comments I agree with is that you should NOT fake yourself, so if you can’t handle conflicting belief systems- THEN it is a very good reason in this situation to walk away.

Several of our early statesmen were willing to deal with a more conciliatory Britain (primarily in trade). Furthermore, there were a quite a few disagreements that happened between the United States and France.    Some examples:   *After the American Revolution, Washington promoted a policy of neutrality while we regrouped and rebuilt. A [French ambassador](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen_Genet) risked that neutrality by raising an army of American mercenaries and taking them raiding.    *As our support in France originated with the upper class, we didn't immediately side with the French revolutionaries. This perceived betrayal resulted in the counter-insult of the [XYZ Affair.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XYZ_Affair)  *While the Louisiana Purchase added a tremendous amount of territory, Napoleon [couldn't make use of it anyway](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lousiana_Purchase#Negotiation). He likely would have also known that New Orleans and the Mississippi had become critical to the United States, and that Jefferson was willing to go to war for both.  *While we decried European imperialism, we insisted that we had [sole claim to the Americas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monroe_doctrine).

The vast majority (92%) of the adverse events reports following Gardasil®  vaccination have included fainting, pain, and swelling at the injection site (the arm), headache, nausea, and fever. Syncope (fainting) is common after injections and vaccinations, especially in adolescents.  That was out of 35 *million* vaccines given.  Also, you're 100% wrong in saying:  &gt;1-2 out of every 100,000 people get Guillian -Barr Syndrome from this vax.  It's actually explained in the link you provided for me:  &gt;Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) has been reported after vaccination with Gardasil® . GBS is a rare neurologic disorder that causes muscle weakness. It occurs in 1-2 out of every 100,000 people in their teens. A number of infections have been associated with GBS. There has been no indication that Gardasil® increases the rate of GBS above the rate expected in the general population, whether or not they were vaccinated.  Here's some more facts about cervical cancer, from this more comprehensive review article:  http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/253513-overview#a0156  Among them:  &gt;The American Cancer Society estimated that in the United States in 2010, 12,200 new cases of cervical cancer would be diagnosed.[5] In addition, more than 50,000 cases of carcinoma in situ are diagnosed each year. Internationally, 500,000 new cases are diagnosed each year. Unlike the United States, where the annual incidence is 6.8 cases or less per 100,000 women, rates in parts of South America and Africa range as high as 52.8 cases per 100,000 women.  That is important, because of the treatments to cure *carcinoma in situ* such as LEEP, cone, and multiple revisions, can lead to cervical insufficiency and the inability to carry an infant to term without severe difficulty and further intervention. That's what happened to my sister after her boyfriend cheated on her when he went to college.

t5_2qh2p,brettalan,1316280305,"CONTINUED:  Figure 3. A molecule will take multiple paths in the double-slit experiment. Later in the book, Hawking describes how Einstein’s theories imply the unification of space and time. When the universe was small enough for quantum theory to apply, it was also massive enough for relativity to apply. Under these extreme conditions, space-time is warped so much that “time behaves like another dimension of space”. People often ask, “What came before the Big Bang?” It appears that there may not have been a “before”. At the very beginning, time did not exist as we know it. Human experience does not apply to the very early universe. Our usual perceptions aren’t consistent with the reality of such extreme circumstances. Hawking makes a comparison that makes the concept easier to understand. Asking what came before the Big Bang is like asking what is south of the South Pole. There is nothing south of the South Pole because there no south at this point. Likewise, there is no before the Big Bang, because there is no time before it. Now the part about quantum theory begins to apply to the Big Bang. Recall that at a quantum level, a particle will take all possible paths, only choosing one when it is observed. Applying this logic to the early, tiny universe began in every possible way. This would mean that an infinite number of universes exist. This is called the multiverse concept. Different universes would have different physical laws. This would explain why our universe formed the way it did. It would be one of an infinite number. Of course, we live in a universe hospitable to life. We would never have evolved otherwise.	 Dr. Krauss has presented his own thoughts on why the universe came to be. In a lecture he gave, he discussed the formation of the universe and why it is here. [5] Krauss tells how he tried to find the shape of the universe, so he could know how it might end. When we look at how the universe ends, we also learn about its beginning. Everything depends heavily on the shape of the universe. There are three possibilities. If there is enough mass in the universe, space-time will curve into itself, closing the universe (This would eventually cause the universe to collapse back into itself). If there is less mass then the critical amount, the universe is open (And ends by tearing itself apart, because of Dark Energy). Krauss’s hypothesis is that the universe must be flat, because if so, the negative energy causes by gravity will be exactly equal in magnitude to the positive energy (of the matter and energy) in the universe. This would make the total amount of energy in the universe zero. This would mean that if you were to add up everything that exists in our universe, you would get nothing. A flat universe is the only one that can come from nothing. If the universe is indeed flat, its existence makes perfect sense.    Firgure 4. Possible shapes of the universe.Ω represents the ratio of actual mass to the amount it would take to make the universe flat. How does Krauss’s hypothesis stand up against scientific testing? Well, it turns out, quite well. He describes how it appears that gravity in galaxies is much stronger than it should be. Scientists have inferred that some mysterious matter causes this gravitational effect. It is called “dark matter”. If you add all the dark matter and the kind of matter we are familiar with together, you’ll get a value that is about 30% of what it would take for the universe to be flat. At first, one might think Krauss was wrong, but it turns out, there is something else that needs to be taken into account. While, conventional logic tells us the universe’s rate of expansion should be slowing down due to the force of gravity, it’s actually speeding up. The force causing this acceleration has been dubbed “dark energy”. Dark matter and dark energy are very mysterious. Quite frankly, scientists have no idea what they really are, and yet they make up about 95% of the known universe. Despite the mystery of these things, they have been measured. If you take the amount of dark energy that would account for the universe’s accelerating expansion and add it to the matter (dark and otherwise), you’ll get just the right amount of total energy to make the universe flat. 	 There is even more evidence for a flat universe. Krauss also describes how the universe’s geometric has actually been measured directly. By placing a large triangle on the surface of the earth, we can measure its geometry. Because the earth is a curved surface, the angles of the triangle will be enlarged, and add up to more than 180°. This same principle works with the three dimensional universe. Recall how the cosmic microwave background radiation is full of nonconformities, or “lumps”. In a closed universe, the light from these galaxies would have been distorted in such a way that the lumps would look bigger then they do. In an open universe, the lumps would look smaller. The size of these lumps is consistent with Krauss’s hypothesis. The universe is flat. 	An age old philosophical question is, “Why is there something rather than nothing?” Dr. Krauss attempts to give an answer based on physics in this lecture. Early on, he shows an animation of the empty space inside a proton. It shows how “virtual particles” seem to come in and out of existence. As I’ve said earlier, quantum physics is really weird. These quantum fluctuations occur where there is “nothing” as we understand it. “Nothing” is inherently unstable. Given that the total of everything in the universe is essentially nothing, it actually makes sense that “something” can come from “nothing”. With quantum fluctuations, it is unavoidable. Given nothing, you get a universe. 	Yet another model of the universe is the Cyclic model. It seems similar to an idea of an oscillating universe, which now seems unlikely, since the universe is probably flat and space-time will not curve back into itself. In the Steinhart-Turok model, dark energy accelerates the universe’s expansion for trillions of years, until other factors far beyond the scope of this paper (having to do with M-theory) bring the acceleration to a halt, followed by a universal collapse. After this, there will be a moment of stability, followed by another Big Bang. The mathematics behind this model would explain dark energy, according to the physicists behind the theory. With the cyclic model, there is no beginning of time. The universe is eternal and goes through endless cycles. [8] There are of course, problems with this theory. It relies heavily on M-theory, which is not well understood. 	Since this beginning of the last century, science has learned much about the universe we live in. We now understand that it began, at least in its current form, around 13.7 billion years ago, and has been expanding ever since. There is a consensus that this happened and a good explanation, with an abundance of supporting evidence, of how it happened. What may be much more intriguing, is why it happened. Many scientists think it was unavoidable, but for different reasons. Proponents of M-theory would say that it had to have happened because string theory causes all possible universes to form. Others believe that it was inevitable because “nothing” is physically unstable and must produce a flat universe, such as ours. While Hawking believes that time itself began to exist at the moment of the Big Bang, so there is no “before”, Steinhardt and Turok think that the universe goes through cycles lasting trillions of years, but it ultimately infinite in age. Many people still want to know exactly how and why the universe exists. Unfortunately, there are many conflicting ideas. Perhaps in the next few generations, a unifying theory that perfectly explains this issue will be developed. The answer to the questions posed today may seem obvious to the people of the future, but as of April 19, 2011, no one can be completely sure. Despite how much has been learned, the unknown is still vastly greater than the known. For the time being, the origin of the universe remains shrouded in controversy and mystery. References  1.

The IP address of the library will be embedded in the e-mail headers, and anyone with a decent amount of computer skills could look at the message source and see it.  ♦ DO NOT send an e-mail from the library's wifi, as they frequently keep logs which can be subpoenaed, unless you know how to forge your MAC address (this is trivial to do in Linux, more difficult with Windows, reply to this post if you want to know how).  ♦ DO use the wifi at a coffee shop or somewhere where you are confident they do not keep logs.  ♦ For extra security, DO use a proxy server in a country which won't respond to a subpoena; register the e-mail account and send the e-mail with the proxy server.  DO NOT use a connection that could be traced back to you to connect to the account.  ♦ DO delete all of your browser history after you do this (this is obvious, but some people aren't tech savvy).  If you want to be extra paranoid, you can use a bootable flash drive which won't save anything.   Any other questions you have you can PM me or reply to this post.

t5_6,mason55,1316548646,"For the inevitable take down:   Yoga mat for sale. Used once at lunch hour class in December 2009. Usage timeline as follows:   11:45a Register for hot yoga class. Infinite wisdom tells me to commit to 5 class package and purchase a yoga mat. I pay $89.74. Money well spent, I smugly confirm to myself.   11:55a Open door to yoga room. A gush of hot dry air rushes through and past me. It smells of breath, sweat and hot. Take spot on floor in back of room next to cute blonde. We will date.   11:57a I feel the need to be as near to naked as possible. This is a problem because of the hot blonde to my left and our pending courtship. She will not be pleased to learn that I need to lose 30 pounds before I propose to her.   11:58a The shirt and sweats have to come off. I throw caution to the wind and decide to rely on my wit and conditioning to overcome any weight issues my fiancÃ©e may take issue with. This will take a lot of wit and conditioning.   11:59a Begin small talk with my bride to be. She pretends to ignore me but I know how she can be. I allow her to concentrate and stare straight ahead and continue to pretend that I don't exist. As we finish sharing our special moment, I am suddenly aware of a sweat moustache that has formed below my nose. This must be from the all the whispering between us.   12:00p Instructor enters the room and ascends her special podium at the front of the room. She is a slight, agitated Chinese woman. She introduces me to the class and everyone turns around to greet me just as I decide to aggressively adjust my penis and testes packed in my Under Armor. My bride is notably unfazed.   12:02p Since I do have experience with Hot Yoga (4 sessions just 5 short years ago) I fully consider that I may be so outstanding and skilled that my instructor may call me out and ask me to guide the class. My wife will look on with a sparkle in her eye. We will make love after class.   12:10p It is now up to 95 degrees in the room. We have been practicing deep breathing exercises for the last 8 minutes. This would not be a problem if we were all breathing actual, you know, oxygen. Instead, we are breathing each other's body odor, expelled carbon dioxide and other unmentionables. (Don't worry, I'll mention them later.)   12:26p It is now 100 degrees and I take notice of the humidity, which is hovering at about 90%. I feel the familiar adorning stare of my bride and decide to look back at her. She appears to be nauseated. I then realize that I forgot to brush my teeth prior to attending this class. We bond.   12:33p It is now 110 degrees and 95% humidity. I am now balancing on one leg with the other leg crossed over the other. My arms are intertwined and I am squatting. The last time I was in this position was 44 years ago in the womb, but I'm in this for the long haul. My wife looks slightly weathered dripping sweat and her eyeliner is streaming down her face. Well, ""for better or worse"" is what we committed to so we press on.   12:40p The overweight Hispanic man two spots over has sweat running down his legs. At least I think its sweat. He is holding every position and has not had a sip of water since we walked in. He is making me look bad and I hate him.   12:44p I consider that if anyone in this room farted that we would all certainly perish.  12:52p It is now 140 degrees and 100% humidity. I am covered from head to toe in sweat. There is not a square millimeter on my body that is not slippery and sweaty. I am so slimy that I feel like a sea lion or a maybe sea eel. Not even a bear trap could hold me. The sweat is stinging my eyeballs and I can no longer see.   12:55p This room stinks of asparagus, cloves, tuna and tacos. There is no food in the room. I realize that this is an amalgamation of the body odors of 30 people in a 140 degree room for the last 55 minutes. Seriously, enough with the asparagus, ok?   1:01p 140 degrees and 130% humidity. Look, bitch, I need my space here so don't get all pissy with me if I accidentally sprayed you with sweat as I flipped over. Seriously, is that where this relationship is going? Get over yourself. We need counseling and she needs to be medicated. Stat!  1:09p 150 degrees and cloudy. And hot. I can no longer move my limbs on my own. I have given up on attempting any of the commands this Chinese chick is yelling out at us. I will lay sedentary until the aid unit arrives. I will buy this building and then have it destroyed.  I lose consciousness.   1:15p I have a headache and my wife is being a selfish bitch. I can't really breathe. All I can think about is holding a cup worth of hot sand in my mouth. I cannot remember what an ice cube is and cannot remember what snow looks like. I consider that my only escape might be a crab walk across 15 bodies and then out of the room. I am paralyzed, and may never walk again so the whole crab walk thing is pretty much out.   1:17p I cannot move at all and cannot reach my water. Is breathing voluntary or involuntary? If it's voluntary, I am screwed. I stopped participating in the class 20 minutes ago. Hey, lady! I paid for this frickin class, ok?! You work for me! Stop yelling at everyone and just tell us a story or something. It's like juice and cracker time, ok?   1:20p It is now 165 degrees and moisture is dripping from the ceiling. The towel that I am laying on is no longer providing any wicking or drying properties. It is actually placing additional sweat on me as I touch it. My towel reeks. I cannot identify the smell but no way can it be from me. Did someone spray some stank on my towel or something?   1:30p Torture session is over. I wish hateful things upon the instructor. She graciously allows us to stay and 'cool down' in the room. It is 175 degrees. Who cools down in 175 degrees? A Komodo Dragon? My wife has left the room. Probably to throw up.   1:34p My opportunity to escape has arrived. I roll over to my stomach and press up to my knees. It is warmer as I rise up from ground level - probably by 15 degrees. So let's conservatively say it's 190. I muster my final energy and slowly rise. One foot in front of the other. One foot in front of the other. Towards the door. Towards the door.   1:37p The temperature in the lobby is 72 degrees. Both nipples stiffen to diamond strength and my penis begins to retract into my abdomen from the 100 degree temp swing. I can once again breathe though so I am pleased. I spot my future ex wife in the lobby. We had such a good thing going but I know that no measure of counseling will be able to unravel the day's turmoil and mental scaring.   1:47p Arrive at Emerald City Smoothie and proceed to order a 32 oz beverage. 402 calories, 0 fat and 14 grams of protein -- effectively negating any caloric burn or benefit from the last 90 minutes. I finish it in 3 minutes and spend the next 2 hours writing this memoir.   3:47p Create Craigslist ad while burning final 2 grams of protein from Smoothie and before the ""shakes"" consume my body.   4:29p Note to self - check car for missing wet yoga towel in am.

This new feature provides an easy way to check monthly household high-speed Internet data usage at any time. Monthly data usage is the amount of data that users send, receive, download or upload each month for movies and videos, photos, web surfing, email, gaming, and other files. &gt;  &gt; Each of our packages has a specific data usage amount. The amount depends on your Cox High Speed Internet package and corresponds to the speeds provided with the package. Our speediest package provides the highest usage amount. You are currently subscribed to the Preferred Package which has a monthly data usage amount of 200 Gigabytes (GB). This is equivalent to streaming about 110 standard definition movies, or 66 high definition movies in a month*. &gt;  &gt; The vast majority of our customers do not exceed their usage amount in a month and Cox does not charge you an additional fee if you exceed it. However, if you find that you are exceeding the usage amount for your package, you should check for the following potential causes: &gt;  &gt; An unsecured wireless home network. If your wireless router does not have security enabled, others outside your home may be using your Internet service. Cox provides a free tool to test the security of your home network. The Home Network Security Check can be accessed by logging into your account via myaccount.cox.net which will place you into Internet Tools. From there, simply select the Home Network tab &gt;  &gt; A computer virus. If your computer is infected with a virus, it may be transmitting large amounts of data without your knowledge. Cox strongly advocates Internet safety and security. That's why we offer all of our High Speed Internet customers free security software that will help protect your computers.

It even comes with parental controls. &gt;  &gt; To download your copy in just a few minutes, simply visit myaccount.cox.net and select the Security Suite tab in Internet Tools. &gt;  &gt;  &gt; 	 &gt; To view your current data usage, follow these easy steps: &gt; 1.

t5_2qhc8,TermsOfContradiction,1316586101,"Cut your over under to 18.5 inches (the minimum legal length) and it will be handy and light, as well as potent enough for bears if you use slugs. An inch taken out of the stock also helps fitting smaller shooters, regular sized folks wearing gear and clothing, and making it easy to carry/pack. A sling would be appreciated while hiking as well.  In my experience Russian made over/unders are of the inexpensive variety, so I wouldn't be overly worried about mods, loss, or wear on a hike.   The great thing about shotguns is that they can use a wide variety of ammunition and, if you know what you are doing, can serve a number of uses. I would suggest a load out of birdshot shells for small game hunting (for emergency survival), slugs for bear protection, and some flare rounds for being spotted.

It is my fault for losing but the game wasn't good. Somehow though you get flamed for actually meaning the words you say. No I won't wish you luck when I'm trying to beat you, no I'm not going to tell you to have fun while playing a game. I get BM'd more often than not by people who gl hf me when I don't reply. They don't mean shit. If people really get annoyed because I won't gl hf you or gg you after a game then welcome to life I guess? Your boss isn't always going to tell you ""Wow great job on that power point!"" while you get high fives from your co-workers at the office.  Also it's not like everyone who is ""BM"" in sc2 has never played a game with a bad community. Yeah we get it, ""You should play X game then come talk to me about BM."" Most of us have, doesn't mean when we play SC2 we think ""Oh golly this community is so much nicer than X game's community, lets be nice to everyone! ♥♥♥"". Also like someone else said, people need to stop thinking they deserve a gl hf or a gg every game. Just because you beat me or I beat meant the game was good. I played a zerg yesterday who fucked up a drone split vs some hellions and quit. I didn't message him after like ""NO GG!?!? MANNER FAGGOT!"" because it wasn't a good game and he knew it, he fucked up and it was an easy win. Happens to me when I fuck up, I just quit and don't say gg because it wasn't a good game.  For me saying gl hf doesn't mean shit because I don't mean anything when I say it. Like really? Good luck, have fun? Good game is more understandable and is the only thing I mean when I say it out of the two because I only say it when it was a good game. Most of the time I'm here to beat you, not wish you fun and luck and hope you have a great time while you play.

t5_6,grumblichu,1316719089,"Text of the article:   &gt;GENEVA (AP) -- A fundamental pillar of physics - that nothing can go faster than the speed of light - appears to be smashed by an oddball subatomic particle that has apparently made a giant end run around Albert Einstein's theories.  &gt;Scientists at the world's largest physics lab said Thursday they have clocked neutrinos traveling faster than light. That's something that according to Einstein's 1905 special theory of relativity - the famous E (equals) mc2 equation - just doesn't happen.  &gt;""The feeling that most people have is this can't be right, this can't be real,"" said James Gillies, a spokesman for the European Organization for Nuclear Research, or CERN, outside the Swiss city of Geneva.  &gt;Gillies told The Associated Press that the readings have so astounded researchers that they are asking others to independently verify the measurements before claiming an actual discovery.  &gt;""They are inviting the broader physics community to look at what they've done and really scrutinize it in great detail, and ideally for someone elsewhere in the world to repeat the measurements,"" he said Thursday.  &gt;Scientists at the competing Fermilab in Chicago have promised to start such work immediately.  &gt;""It's a shock,"" said Fermilab head theoretician Stephen Parke, who was not part of the research in Geneva. ""It's going to cause us problems, no doubt about that - if it's true.""  &gt;The Chicago team had similar faster-than-light results in 2007, but those came with a giant margin of error that undercut its scientific significance.  &gt;Outside scientists expressed skepticism at CERN's claim that the neutrinos - one of the strangest well-known particles in physics - were observed smashing past the cosmic speed barrier of 186,282 miles per second (299,792 kilometers per second).  &gt;University of Maryland physics department chairman Drew Baden called it ""a flying carpet,"" something that was too fantastic to be believable.  &gt;CERN says a neutrino beam fired from a particle accelerator near Geneva to a lab 454 miles (730 kilometers) away in Italy traveled 60 nanoseconds faster than the speed of light. Scientists calculated the margin of error at just 10 nanoseconds, making the difference statistically significant. But given the enormous implications of the find, they still spent months checking and rechecking their results to make sure there was no flaws in the experiment.  &gt;""We have not found any instrumental effect that could explain the result of the measurement,"" said Antonio Ereditato, a physicist at the University of Bern, Switzerland, who was involved in the experiment known as OPERA.  &gt;The CERN researchers are now looking to the United States and Japan to confirm the results.  &gt;A similar neutrino experiment at Fermilab near Chicago would be capable of running the tests, said Stavros Katsanevas, the deputy director of France's National Institute for Nuclear and Particle Physics Research. The institute collaborated with Italy's Gran Sasso National Laboratory for the experiment at CERN.  &gt; Katsanevas said help could also come from the T2K experiment in Japan, though that is currently on hold after the country's devastating March 11 earthquake and tsunami.  &gt; Scientists agree if the results are confirmed, that it would force a fundamental rethink of the laws of nature.  &gt;Einstein's special relativity theory that says energy equals mass times the speed of light squared underlies ""pretty much everything in modern physics,"" said John Ellis, a theoretical physicist at CERN who was not involved in the experiment. ""It has worked perfectly up until now.""  &gt; He cautioned that the neutrino researchers would have to explain why similar results weren't detected before, such as when an exploding star - or supernova - was observed in 1987.  &gt; ""This would be such a sensational discovery if it were true that one has to treat it extremely carefully,"" said Ellis.  &gt; © 2011 The Associated Press.",22574,3134,0,0,1,1,©

t5_2rd6n,celoyd,1316830445,"It would be my pleasure!  Here’s a quick and easy way of getting cool images out of MODIS. There are a lot of other ways if you get into it, but this one should serve you well for now.  As an example, let’s say we’re looking for a good satellite photo of a large, rugged but fairly cultivated island.  Start on [the LANCE subset directory](http://lance.nasa.gov/imagery/rapid-response/subsets/). A *subset* is just a chunk of geography as seen by MODIS, presented with a consistent projection and indexed over time. A given point on the earth might be covered by different subsets with different purposes – one agency might have it in a subset to study logging, another in a subset to track air pollution, another in a subset that looks for flooding, and so on.  Let’s look in Africa. Click Africa under Places and [this page](http://lance-modis.eosdis.nasa.gov/imagery/subsets/?area=af) will open in a new window. Every red square here is a clickable subset. The background image of Africa is *not* exactly what we’ll see; it’s an idealized, cloudless composite. Let’s have a look at Madagascar, the large island to the southeast of the continent. This happens to be covered by “FAS Subsets”, the upper right overview map.  When you click the red box around Madagascar, you’ll see [this](http://lance-modis.eosdis.nasa.gov/imagery/subsets/?subset=Madagascar.2011266): a matrix of different observations made by the two satellites that make up MODIS. The leftmost column is the one with visibile light, and of those two the top one (from the Terra satellite) is the only one with complete data. (Incomplete data is white. It can be incomplete because of the way the satellites’ orbits worked out, because there was a reception problem, or – when you’re looking at today’s page – because the satellite hasn’t been overhead yet.)  So let’s click that upper left picture. [Ta-da!](http://lance-modis.eosdis.nasa.gov/imagery/subsets/?subset=Madagascar.2011266.terra.1km)  Two things to note:  1. You can zoom in and out with the “View alternate pixel size” links. The default is that 1 pixel = 1000 m, or one kilometer. At 2 km, the image is half as wide, at 500 m it’s twice as wide, and so on.  2. The simplest way to download the image is to click directly on it. It took me a while to figure this out….  So if you want oodles of rugged island texture, you can click “250m” and get – don’t click this if your computer is low on memory, because it’s a 21 megapixel image – [this](http://lance-modis.eosdis.nasa.gov/imagery/subsets/?subset=Madagascar.2011266.terra.250m). Phew!  Now, there’s a potential problem here: clouds. We could go back to the matrix of images taken of that subset that day, then click the “prev” button until we spot a nice clear image. Or we could de a web search for the dry season in Madagascar and type a date in that range into the Data field. (I recall some subsets have a great calendar view with thumbnails for entire months on one page, but frankly I forget where to find that. Keep an eye out!)  If you want to try another approach, we can go back to [the LANCE subset directory](http://lance.nasa.gov/imagery/rapid-response/subsets/) and pick one of the Projects. As an example, let’s go with the last one, the miscellaneous “Other Subsets”. This gives us [a map of the world with subsets distributed at what looks like random](http://lance-modis.eosdis.nasa.gov/imagery/subsets/?project=other). You can choose any one of those and get a subset view just like we saw for Madagascar. For example, [here’s the British Isles](http://lance-modis.eosdis.nasa.gov/imagery/subsets/?subset=United_Kingdom_Ireland.2011266): looks pretty cloudy today.

t5_2qh13,Vulpyne,1316985083,"&gt; Then why did you refer to the whole of the world population? Are you implying that everybody is suffering?  You initially said that bullfights are a drop in the ocean of cattle suffering.   * Suffering generated by aggregate bullfights ↔ All cattle suffering  * Death caused by me killing homeless person ↔ All human life  Just because something is a small piece of an aggregate doesn't mean it cannot be judged or opposed if it's considered negative, or that actions which remove the negative are not to be considered positive and worthwhile.  Hopefully my response makes more sense to you now.  Now you could have said ""The suffering from bullfights is fairly small compared to that caused by the factory farm industry. We should focus our energies on eliminating the latter before the former."" although I may still have disagreed. Did you read the link I supplied in my last response?  &gt; As has often been pointed out, banning bullfighting altogether wouldn't just remove the suffering of the bullfights themselves but also result in the eradication of the bullfighting bull breeds, as they wouldn't have a purpose any more. [...]  Are you equating not breeding members of a species with killing individuals of the species that already exist? If so, I don't think that is a defensible argument.   &gt; Well, I disagree. That's just a recipe for a tyranny of the majority, who can make heavy-handed, intolerant laws as they know they won't have to suffer the consequences. There's a reason why equality before the law is considered a fundamental principle of Western democracies.  Uniform application of harm prevention should obviously be the goal. As I said before, I will accept some hypocrisy if I believe it is a net gain. I guess we'll just have to disagree on this point - at least for the most general case.",63326,595,0,0,1,1,↔

Big McGee Lake was an awesome place to camp at.. though I didn't do any fishing there were some people doing that, as i looked on enviously.  There was also a Mule Pack station right at the trail head, if you want to go that route here is the website.

Enjoy a late summer weekend in this colorful, high-elevation setting.  Friday morning hike 7.5 miles 2500' gain up McGee Creek through aspens, pines and meadows to the beautiful red rock mountains of upper McGee Creek Canyon. We'll camp alongside Big McGee Lake at 10,500' elevation. Sat. morning hike to McGee Pass, climb Red Slate Mountain (Class 2, approx. 2700' gain, 6 miles roundtrip), and return to camp for happy hour. Sunday morning hike out. Total mileage approx. 25 miles roundtrip, 5200' gain, moderate pace. $5 permit fee payable to Ldr. E-mail both leaders with experience and conditioning.   WTC Students: Remember to bring your class card for the leaders to sign if you need this trip to graduate!

Directions to Trailhead: Turn left from US 395 on McGee Creek Road (north of Bishop near Crowley Lake) and follow it to the trailhead parking area at the end of the road, past the pack station.  The road turns to packed gravel about a mile from the end. Map to Trailhead: http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;hl=en&amp;msa=0&amp;ll=37.550702,-118.812504&amp;spn=0.021707,0.045018&amp;z=15&amp;msid=102860879910653752742.00048efd8b7f30d0817cf  (Copy and paste to your browser's address bar if the link gets split by your e-mail program!)  Proper food Storage:  Bear canisters are recommended but not required on this trail by the US Forest Service, but they are required by the leaders for this trip. Bear bagging is not an effective method for keeping bears away from your food, and we are not willing to chance inviting bears or other wildlife into our campsite.  Clean food, trash, and scented items out of your car before you leave it at the trailhead.  Put coolers or water bottles out of sight in your trunk or cargo area.  More information: http://www.fs.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsinternet/!ut/p/c4/04_SB8K8xLLM9MSSzPy8xBz9CP0os3gDfxMDT8MwRydLA1cj72DTUE8TAwjQL8h2VAQAMtzFUw!!/?ss=110504&amp;navtype=BROWSEBYSUBJECT&amp;cid=FSBDEV3_003846&amp;navid=150100000000000&amp;pnavid=150000000000000&amp;position=SubFeature*&amp;ttype=detailfull&amp;pname=Inyo%2520National%2520Forest-%2520Outdoor%2520Safety%2520&amp;%2520Ethics  Altitiude Acclimatization: Our campsite is over 10,000 feet, and you may have problems hiking up to that altitude, especially coming from sea level. If you have to leave the trip early because of altitude sickness, we won't be able to sign your class card.  So, come up as early as you can on Thursday and camp or lodge near the trailhead between 7500-9000 feet to give yourself time to adjust.  Pat and I will be spending the night at the McGee Creek Campground, not far from the trailhead (sites are first come, first served).  There are other campgrounds and lodges in the area if you prefer more creature comforts.  Consider Tom's Place or McGee Creek Lodge.  Bishop will not cut it; it's too low in elevation to do you any good.  See your doctor for an Rx for acetazolamide (Diamox®) if you know you may have difficulty.  Also, we will hike in at a very moderate pace.  This isn't a race, and it will help you adjust to the higher altitude.  Remember to hydrate well before the trip and stay that way during.  We'll be happy to stop for split breaks as often as necessary!  Recent altitude experience will also do you a lot of good, so get up to one of our local 10K+ peaks next weekend if you haven't been on a high altitude trip in the last couple of weeks.  Carpooling:  I am supplying a participant list to help you arrange carpools - see attachment.   If you can't open it, let me know.

Certain biblical passages and mannerisms make absolutely no sense in today's language.  That said if you want the word for word translation while maintaining the original structure of the hebrew language, go for the English Standard Version (ESV) or New American Standard Version (what most seminaries recommend).  If you want a good readable translation that waters down juussstt a bit, go for the Holman Christian Standard Version.  FCA's official bibles are Holman translations, and so if you didn't mind, you could probably get one for free from your local FCA.  the New International Version is probably the worst translation ever, barring using the king james in a modern sense.

Sad thing is its one of the most widely used platforms, and I learned about my former faith using it.  tl;dr I'd recommend Holman or NASB for your purposes. Stay clear of NIV, it omits tons of good stuff.  EDIT: thought i'd throw out a comparison of three versions.  Hebrews 11:11 is a key verse about sara giving birth in her old age:  New International Version (©1984) By faith Abraham, even though he was past age--and Sarah herself was barren--was enabled to become a father because he considered him faithful who had made the promise.  English Standard Version (©2001) By faith Sarah herself received power to conceive, even when she was past the age, since she considered him faithful who had promised.  Holman Christian Standard Bible By faith even Sarah herself, when she was barren, received power to conceive offspring, even though she was past the age, since she considered that the One who had promised was faithful.  Note the Holman is in between the two extremes, making it an easier read but maintaining the original emphases",8640,4701,0,0,1,1,©

t5_2qhon,Cheeseho12,1317173970,"When creating comics no filing of copyright is needed.  Under current law an 'original creation' is automatically copyrighted upon its creation in a 'fixed medium' (as soon as you write or draw it). Registering a copyright is generally only done as a precursor to legal action, or in anticipation of legal action.  As long as your comic has a publication date and a one line notice of copyright (ex: RedditDude#1 © September 2011 by Steve Jobs) you're cool.    Now, if your book sells 100,000 copies, then you might want to look into copyrighting it, but seeing as most indie comics sell somewhere around of 5,000 (that's if you're published by a studio, if you're doing it yourself, look forward to sales south of 500), you're most likely fine.    Even if someone steals your idea (which in a decade of publishing I've never seen happen beyond the occasional t-shirt, and the Emily the Strange weirdness) the plus to you is you're covered, the drawback is the qualification for what counts as 'original' is pretty low, there is a test where you have to find five distinct similarities before you can go forward with any sort of legal action, and then you have to have the money to follow through with it.",492,1034,0,0,0,1,©

This is absolutely true. I made a leap there. It would probably be fairer to say that the contradiction of situations in the post allows people to guess that ""something might be up"". But at that point it's so general that it loses any useful meaning. I think I'm coming around to your viewpoint on the matter.  &gt; Whether you are wrong or I am wrong, the fact of the matter is, your still defending the act of making newcomers potentially feel unwelcome.    Here is where I really must protest. Quite the contrary, I'm not defending the act of making newcomers potentially feel unwelcome. I'm saying that that is not what people are doing. They aren't trying to potentially make newcomers unwelcome.    I would say that they're acting in a normal fashion within a pre-existing social structure and that, generally speaking, the community acts in a healthy way to help nurture and inform new members. There are always outliers, but I believe they are just that: outliers.    My concern with your statement is that if we even pay lip service to the idea of being concerned about _potentially_ insulting, offending, or hurting someone's feelings in a way that may be considered unwelcome then we run the risk of removing some of the remaining constructive conversation that /r/starcraft generates.    Take our conversation right here. If I was more guarded with my words for fear of insulting you, or if you hadn't been willing to chastise what you felt was a wrong doing, we would never have reached this point of mutual understanding.    I'd rather see people less guarded about what they say (within reason) than have people watching their words and worrying about making newcomers uncomfortable.    Being new in any community is always uncomfortable. Especially since every community (especially on the internet) has its fair share of very vocal jerks. As a new member you just need to remember that if you're at the point where you're running into the jerks, you're at the point where you're learning and growing your understanding of the community. At the very least you'll learn if it's worth learning how to deal with a particular community's jerks in order to join the community.    All that said, I can't discount your personal bad experience with trolls, bigots, and grammar nazi. I just hope the frequency with which you have to deal with them wanes. :)    Best wishes, and we ♥ you too! Don't forget it!",6281,83,0,0,1,1,♥

I own a original xbox running xbmc, its really a great machine, but it is easily outclassed by any Intel Atom/Ion HTPC.   **Xbox limitations and rules to follow when replacing the hard drive:**   •A 7200rpm harddrive won't give any speed improvements over a 5400rpm, and the 5400rpm runs cooler and quieter.   •Neither do you get a speed increase out of more harddrive cache so save money and get one with less.   •Up to 2TB (2048GB) in size. Upgrading your harddrive will also speedup Xbox loading and boot-up times.   -Note: XBMC only supports F: and G: partitions for harddrives and 512GB per partition! If you want to install a harddrive larger than 137GB then you need a LBA48 compatible Xbox 'hacked' BIOS.   •If a partition is larger than 256GB, the harddrive needs to be formatted with 32k clusters, use XBpartitioner 1.1 or later.XBpartitioner 1.1 or later is used to partition extra partitions such as F: and G: (not the default C:, E:, X:, Y: and Z:)   •Largest partition supported by a LBA48 BIOS and 32k clusters is 512GB, so 512GB+ need G: partition.   **In regards to USB Mass Storage devices:**  •The following are known XBMC (and Xbox) limitations (if you are a programmer then help us overcome the XBMC limitations*):   •Only ""read-only"" support for FAT12/FAT16/FAT32 (so write support is limited to FATX)*   •Maximum 4GB in 'device'/'drive' size (ie. the size of the whole flash-storage or harddrive)*   **And [here](http://www.xbmc4xbox.org/wiki/index.php?title=XBMC_Features_and_Supported_Formats/Codecs) is a list of all the supported media content.**  *In general, XBMC running on a standard Xbox cannot play native HD format videos, but can upscale standard definition or lower format video to HD resolutions.*   **The XBox's 733Mhz Intel Pentium-III CPU, is too slow to play native HD video (Microsoft® and DivX® recommends a 2.4 Ghz PC + 384MB RAM for 720p MPEG-4 playback!). This means that you might only get maybe 10-20fps (frames per second) displayed, which will appear jerky and un-viewable.**  -On a standard XBox the following HD formats are supported:   •480i/480p/576i/576p output at 480p (Not Scaled).   •480i/480p/576i/576p output at 720p (Upscaled).   •480i/480p/576i/576p output at 1080i (Upscaled).   **-The following video resolutions are NOT supported, at any output resolution:**   •720p   •1080i   This is the site where I copy pasta'd all this info from, [xbmc4xbox.org wiki](http://www.xbmc4xbox.org/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page). Just beware what the limitations are, I'm not trying to convince you not to use the xbox, jus want to make sure you know what to expect.

t5_2cneq,jaeldi,1317303453,"Your use of percentages in #2 makes you look foolish to me.   ""The top 1% of earners are paying 38% of all income taxes"". To summarize, the wealthy pay more taxes. Isn't that because they are earning more money? Yes it is. So big fat ""DUH!"" on your #2.   Does the tax code already tax higher incomes at a higher percentage? Yes it does. Is that fair? meh, not really, but fair is a relative word. It's a democracy, the majority decides what is fair. The majority is not in that 1%, so too bad for them. Personally I would like to see a flat rate tax across all citizens, but even that system will have wealthy tax attorneys arguing that ""my client's crazy big pile of money they received this year is not 'income' and therefore shouldn't be taxed"" just like they do now. And lower income people can't afford those kind of services to protect their income from taxation. Lower income people will never make enough money to make it worth the tax attorney's trouble to pursue them as a client.  The business world has similar unbalanced tax policies. Currently small businesses can't compete with larger ""mega"" corps because Juan's Lawn Care of Dallas, who is successful and makes $200,000 profit a year can't afford a tax attorney to help him move that profit to Bermuda, call it international profit, and then not pay any tax in the US on that profit like Bank of America, Citigroup, At&amp;t, and Exxon can. That's not fair. That's not free market. There is a loop hole in a law creating this situation that is interfering with the free market in favor of wealthier companies.   Tax incentives are subsidies. All government subsidies, IMO, should go away. They always skew the real value of business holdings giving someone somewhere an unfair advantage. These tax policies are not free market. They are screwing the system up by allowing larger groups to stay large and keeping small groups small and not as wealthy. True conservatives, who believe less government is better, would be against tax incentives for anyone.   Plus I think your ideas on technology show inexperience. Jumps in technology can't help everyone all at once. A new technology often puts an old one out of business, so in the long game its a wash. You are saying the same thing about technology and economics that people were saying in '98 before it all washed away in 2000. That kind of thinking is 'get rich quick' and it never lasts, it creates extreme peaks and valleys.   With the current tax code, Juan's Lawn Care will never be able to amass that tipping point amount of wealth to become JUANCORP© on his own. Larger corps that make more money and don't pass as much tax will always out pace him. Now he could do what Zuckerberg did and find some investors to give him a mountain of money before he even made any profit, but that's a hard sell on a landscaping business. There is only one Mark Zuckerberg, there are tens of thousands of small business owners like Juan. It sounds like you are saying ""everyone should just do what that one guy who was in the right place at the right time did"".   What I'm saying is the current tax code is indeed flawed. Loopholes that allow people and businesses to pay less or no taxes should be removed, the definition of income should be simplified to tax all income levels more fairly (according to the democratic majority's opinion), and all incentives should be eliminated also for all income levels.",56323,7612,0,0,0,1,©

t5_2qjxn,AISim,1317334954,"Here is the section about it from the letter if you want to know. &gt;Jamie was a dean of music in a university, who had surreptitiously been meeting with other faculty members for sÃ©ances which he said regularly produced levitation of objects. He and his wife were visiting his sister who was an aunt of one of our group, so we arranged a couple evenings together, at his sister's home. We interlocked our hands on the surface of an 18lb. wicker table, and hardly had the lights been turned off before the table rose toward the ceiling causing us to stand and the shorter ones to stand on tip toe. JL was our photographer; but the flash caught the top of the table and Jamie's body had cast a huge shadow where we didn't want it. We planned the next try carefully; I was to leave the table after it rose, and insert a flash bulb in a remote flash unit, I would then reenter the group and count out the oscillations of the table, with even numbers when the bottom of the table would show , and when I started counting Jamie was to sit down and pull back from the area. JL was to take the picture on some even count. It worked, except that Jamie held his hands protectively in front of his face and the pictures showed on table leg almost as if he hadn't yet let go of it, and in my reaching over the others I had let my thumb fall below the edge of the table. As evidence it seemed clear that he and I might have been supporting the table. The table then turned up on edge, and landed softly upside down between Jamie and the camera, and there was no picture to show that. Many much more glamorous incidents have been reported by others, but remember that I'm telling only my personal experiences, and this, with other phenomena not photographed or outlined here makes me classify this as most probably true levitation. (We had other controls that night that eliminated Jamie as a willful manipulator, and it had gone on for some time when I was not even touching the table.) Look at the picture!",23606,14090,0,0,1,1,©

I'm only posting this because I have an inside view of the policy, and am interested in letting you, my fellow Redditors have access to the information you deserve.)  IAMA Senior BoA Client Service Specialist, and for the benefit of my fellow redditors, I'm going to post a few points from our general-issue talking points regarding this change.  (Off the record, I will say that I'm not happy about the new fee, but it's very likely that most banks will be instating something similar in the coming year or so.)  **Why are we charging customers for using their debit cards?**  * The economics of offering a debit card have changed with recent regulations.   * Like many other banks across the industry, we are choosing to charge a fee so we can continue to provide a payment vehicle that offers convenience, control, security and utility.   * Bank of America will begin charging a $5 debit card purchase monthly fee in early 2012. Customers have told us they want us to be clear and fair about fees, and introducing a debit card purchase monthly fee is consistent with our decision to move away from penalty fees and toward charging fees for services customers choose to use.   * A number of our competitors are assessing or testing debit fees  **What is the debit card purchase monthly fee?**  * The debit card purchase monthly fee is charged when making PIN or signature-based point of sale purchases in-store, by phone or online. The fee will be triggered by the first debit card purchase within a statement cycle and will appear on the customer’s bank statement the following month.  * Electronic and recurring payments/ACH transactions made using the debit card number will trigger the new fee. Recurring payments made using a checking account number will not trigger the new fee.  * If a customer does not use his or her debit card for purchases in a given statement cycle, they will not be charged a debit card purchase monthly fee for that statement cycle.  * Customers will only pay the $5 fee once per statement cycle, regardless of how many debit card purchases they make or how many debit cards they have linked to their account in a given statement cycle.   **Will all customers or account types be charged a debit card purchase monthly fee?**  * No, the debit fee will apply only to consumer products (not small business) and will not apply to all account types.  * The following consumer account types will not be subject to the fee:  o Platinum PrivilegesTM customers, where available  o Bank of America Premium accounts, where available  o Advantage (Model); Prima® (CA): Preferred (NE)  o Merrill Lynch Wealth Management® clients with qualifying balances  o U.S. Trust® clients  o Campus Edge®  **How will existing customers learn about the new debit card purchase monthly fee?**  * Existing customers will learn about the new debit card purchase monthly fee through communications beginning in early 2012. Impacted customers will receive notice in writing at least 30 days before the new fee goes into effect for their account.   Also of note: ""Some of our competitors have announced their intent to charge or test debit fees: such as Wells Fargo, Chase, SunTrust, BB&amp;T and Regions.""
