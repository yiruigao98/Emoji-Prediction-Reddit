While on a European buying trip, John E. Brooks, the grandson of our founder, observed that polo players had cleverly anchored their collars to their shirts by means of buttons, thus keeping their collars from flying into their faces during gameplay. Inspired by what he saw, he came back to Brooks and introduced the original Polo Button-Down to America that same year, thereby changing the face of menswear forever.  IMO, thats akin to a Strauss adding rivets to his dungarees.",868,323,0,0,1,1,¬Æ

Honestly i'm not sure about how viable it is for low level gaming, but wouldn't you rather fork over a little more and get something that can play on medium or higher? It's your choice at the end of the day, but in my view it's worth considering.     Either way i'd recommend one of the latest i3 or i5 sandy bridge processors (i7 is more the ¬£600 range) as you can get them cheap and they're new hardware which is more efficient, and well, better. I'm not too sure on AMD if you choose to go that route but remember it's not all about clock speeds, efficiency plays a part.    Whatever you choose to get, look up some reviews for it and look at some benchmarks for it, it should give you a good idea of whether or not it'll play what you want.  Edit: [This](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Acer-Notebook-i3-370M-Mobility-Wireless/dp/tech-data/B0045UBCSU/ref=de_a_smtd) looks like a good laptop and it's got a discrete graphics card, Benchmarks [here](http://www.notebookcheck.net/ATI-Mobility-Radeon-HD-5470.23698.0.html), as you can see it's a lot better for games and can play pretty much anything on low. **You can probably find something cheaper and better, this was just a quick search I did, feel free to look around.**  Also, I am the same person as who you replied to.",9260,2382,0,0,1,1,¬Æ

t5_2qh3p,wtf_advice,1309529326,"You should probably choose a REALTOR¬Æ. First off, the term ""REALTOR¬Æ"" is a registered collective membership mark that identifies a real estate professional who is a member of the NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS¬Æ and subscribes to its strict Code of Ethics (which in many cases goes beyond state law). In most areas, it is the REALTOR¬Æ who shares information on the homes they are marketing, through a Multiple Listing Service (MLS). Working with a REALTOR¬Æ who belongs to an MLS will give you access to the greatest number of homes.   A REALTOR¬Æ is held to an even higher standard of conduct under the NAR‚Äôs Code of Ethics. In recent years, state laws have been passed setting up various duties for different types of agents. As you start working with a REALTOR¬Æ, ask for a clear explanation of your state's current regulations, so that you will know where you stand on these important matters.   In making your decision to work with an agent, there are certain questions you should ask when evaluating a potential agent. The first question you should ask is whether the agent is a REALTOR¬Æ . You should then ask:  - Does the agent have an active real estate license in good standing? To find this information, you can check with your state‚Äôs governing agency.  - Does the agent belong to the Multiple Listing Service (MLS) and/or a reliable online home buyer‚Äôs search service? Multiple Listing Services are cooperative information networks of REALTORS¬Æ that provide descriptions of most of the houses for sale in a particular region.  - Is real estate their full-time career?  - What real estate designations does the agent hold?  - Which party is he or she representing--you or the seller? This discussion is supposed to occur early on, at ""first serious contact"" with you. The agent should discuss your state's particular definitions of agency, so you'll know where you stand.  - In exchange for your commitment, how will the agent help you accomplish your goals? Show you homes that meet your requirements and provide you with a list of the properties he or she is showing you?   If you have a realtor, this *menage a trois* will probably go very well for you.",2505,10,0,0,1,1,¬Æ

t5_2qhrv,Badvibez,1309595903," Wednesday 6/29: As the day went on and we left the resort, we climbed back in to the rental car (same seating as before) and had a good time telling funny stories, random tales, and exploits from other / this training (not including our hook-up antics of course). When we got to the airport HB10 was as friendly as normal. All 10 of us from the class that were flying back to Seattle grabbed lunch, and after lunch she asked if I wanted to play cards. We proceeded to play Egyptian war for about an hour per her request 1 v 1 while everyone else just chilled around us on other seats. At this point I was feeling good because we were interacting in the same positive/fun manner as before we hooked up.   Unfortunately we didn‚Äôt have seats next to each other on the flight, but that was fine because I slept the whole way‚Ä¶ I had gotten so little sleep the last couple nights and the limited amount I did get was terrible. Once we landed in Seattle I asked her and the gay dude if they wanted a ride back to their houses because I had drove and they had taken cabs originally. They both accepted. On the drive home I asked them if they wanted to grab dinner (I had no groceries in my house and didn‚Äôt want to do any work that night). The gay dude had plans already, but HB10 accepted. So we dropped him off and headed to her house since she lives downtown in the city. Once there, she changed and we headed out to a nice / somewhat classy joint.   During dinner our conversation was primarily focused on deeper topics such as family members, which lead to discussion about the death of her father a couple years ago, dating with age gaps, her 7 year relationship she had gotten out of a few months ago, and our future career plans etc in relation to whether we would stay with this firm or work somewhere else. Based on this conversation I felt pretty strongly that this girl isn‚Äôt just a complete slut and is extremely intelligent (you have to be to be in our line of work), has some strong morale fiber, and has worked hard in her life). We left dinner and headed back to her apartment on foot (it was about 7 blocks). On the way back we bumped into each other, put our arms around each other for a bit, and then finally relinquished.   I really wanted to reach out and hold her hand, but was unsure because I felt like she was A) Really into me and it would be ok, or B) more likely that she was kind of in to me, but wasn‚Äôt ready for a ‚Äúclinger stage 9‚Äù just because we had hooked up. That second option may make her sound like slut in this FR, but I still don‚Äôt get that vibe. I honestly think I just ran perfect game on her up to this point and it would have been hard for any non-prude girl to say no (I don‚Äôt mean that to be bragging because I am a NEWB PUA, but this time it just clicked). We got back to her place and she invited me in to watch some TV. We hopped on the couch but resided not to drink since we had done so much over the last few days. While watching TV we were side by side again (arms, legs, hips touching), but I just felt weird putting my arm around her or holding her hand because I didn‚Äôt want to send any DLV spikes. I had played hard to get and demonstrated higher value / ‚Äúout of her league‚Äù vibes all week (which had gotten me the F-close‚Ä¶). I guess I just didn‚Äôt want to abandon those tactics even if I had already decided I wanted to pursue a relationship with this girl. After a couple hours I declared I should go so I could make it to work tomorrow (time constraint). Before I left I went to use her bathroom. When I came out she was in her bedroom. I couldn‚Äôt see exactly where (Should I have walked around the corner?) so I just called out, ‚ÄúHey I am taking off‚Äù. She walked to the front door and we exchanged a long 5ish second hug. Once again, I wanted to kiss her or something. FFS ‚Äì I had F-closed it the night before, but since in the morning when I kissed her on the cheek she didn‚Äôt try to initiate more‚Ä¶ I just didn‚Äôt want to push to hard. So I left.   Thursday 6/30: She invited me through email to a get together with a couple other co-workers on Friday. I told her yes and asked a few ‚Äúhow are you doing‚Äù type questions. She responded and continued the conversation. This went back a forth a few times with her sending the last message that night (she worked super late).  Friday 7/1: Our firm had this day off, but I got screwed and had to work it along with Saturday and Monday (the 4th) since our client has a tight deadline. However, I got the clearance with my boss to leave by 3pm to go meet up with ‚Äúfriends‚Äù (HB10). Since the intern wasn‚Äôt out on the firm holiday, I had to go grab donuts for the Client‚Äôs employees. On my walk over I texted HB10 and asked if I could leave my computer at her house before we went out with the friends (he house was near where we were headed). She called me a few seconds later and said, ‚ÄúHey, so another friend of mine invited me to the Oregon Coast for the weekend so I am going to cancel our plans‚Äù.   I am thinking FFS, I already bought tickets to the event. Instead of sounding pissy though and sending DLV spikes, I said, ‚ÄúOh that‚Äôs fine, no big deal. How are you going to return your tickets?‚Äù   She replied, ‚ÄúOh you bought your tickets? I haven‚Äôt yet‚Ä¶‚Äù At this point I am thinking WTF, this was locked down last night, but now she is tweaking stuff around‚Ä¶ almost like she is trying to push me through a hoop/compliance test (THIS could have been my first big mistake by accepting her invitation). For the record, She wasn‚Äôt a complete bitch about it though because while on the phone with me she called the event on her hardline phone (with me still on the cell in the other hand) and begged them to refund my money ‚Äì which they did. Once she finished that she struck up some casual conversation as I was walking back from the donut shop. I negged her about her phone and her groggly voice from lack of sleep, but all in all we had a nice 5 minute genuine phone call. Before I hung up (and I feel like this was my second big FUCKING mistake). Finally, I said ‚Äì well since I don‚Äôt get to drive out to the lake with my friends on the 4th since I am working, do you have any recommendations for doing the 4th in Seattle (I just moved here). She threw out some general options, but then said, ‚ÄúMy friends and I might go out on another friends boat OR we might watch the fireworks from my apartments rooftop. You can PROBABLY come to those, but you should just use them as a backup plan since I don‚Äôt know if there will be room on the boat or if we will come back to my place for sure‚Äù. I blew off that statement like it was no thing, but at that point I realized that this girl had started to take the power. Between scheduling and cancelling our event on Friday and then dangling a MAYBE you can come invite for the 4th ‚Äì I feel like I lost all momentum. I need help getting it back ‚òπ   So as you can see this is a beast of a FR, that is less flashy than my other, but I wanted to get some feedback on stuff I did right/wrong, and how I move forward. I love sarging, but this girl is incredible and I would like to not fuck it up. I can usually get a #, K, or F close‚Ä¶ but always after that for girls I am actually into‚Ä¶. I have trouble converting. Sigh‚Ä¶. Thanks fellow PUAers! ",-7,1,0,0,1,1,‚òπ

t5_2qh03,Nienordir,1309650472,"One of the most overrated games of 2010. While I enjoyed the atmosphere and crazy character design, the actual gameplay has a few very frustrating flaws and 'road bumps', like..  * saving quickly, instead of having to find a suitable area, set up camp, waiting for the screen to load. (you could 'hack' a save by using a horse deed, but seriously why not place it into the menu..) * the lack of checkpoints (ride from on side of the map to the other, die and have to start on the other side again..or go through the annoying save procedure, that breaks the flow of the game). * non functional path finding (rarely did the game show the shortest route and the enviroment is to generic to find your way around).  A triple A title should be more polished than that, but the absolutely worst thing was the story. I can't recall another game that insulted my intelligence on this scale.  Marston was a cool guy and it kicks off great with a nice intro, you get shot and help on the farm, because you owe them your life, but boy does it take a nose dive after that. My theory is, Rockstar spent 2/3 of the available time on the open world and then figured out the main story only covers 5 hours, so they desperately scrambled for filler missions, but since they ran out of time they stuffed all of them onto the main story npcs.  Seriously _every_ npc does the same shit to you.. ""no dude, that's not how we roll, take it slow!"", ""yeah, I'm on it, but _first_ you gotta do me a favor.."", ""I haven't forgotten, don't push me..it needs time"". Everyone does it at least 3-4 times the marshall, the salesman, the graverobber. Oh, yeah that irish jerk, who _knows_ where the gun is, but you go to the wrong place, find it later, but then it doesn't have any bullets (of course not..why should it).  And you can't skip anything, because they're all linked to the main story. Then you get into Mexico and they do the same shit again, but it gets even worse because they only work from 11am-13pm (or whatever) and there is no way to skip time and those guys do even worse stuff to you. Finally you get into the Blackwater only to get ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• by the federal agents in the same way like every ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• npc before.  I just stopped caring about Marston, the story or anything else, it's nothing but a bad joke and probably one of the worst story&amp;mission design in the history of gaming. It wouldn't have been half that bad if they had put those missions into optional side quests or did a better job instead of having every ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• npc ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• you over in the same ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• pattern with the same ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• excuses.  Finally the ambient challenges, of course you have to do them all in order. Why would you unlock them all and give players the option to fulfill their requirements naturally while exploring the world. No, make the player backtrack through the whole world in a fixed pattern, it's not like you have to waste time between missions, because the npcs have a limited timeframe..  RDR had a lot of potential, but ruined it in every possible way. I really wanted to like it, but that was to much..",15492,345,0,0,1,1,‚ô•

t5_6,Thermodynamicist,1309888218,"I'd say it's more of a drivable aeroplane than a flying car.  Personally, I'm not especially convinced by some of the decisions taken. In particular:  &gt; The NHTSA agreed with the position‚Äîemphasized by AOPA in its comments on the exemption request‚Äîthat the Transition could enhance aviation safety by giving VFR-only pilots who are confronted with deteriorating weather the option to divert to the nearest airport and continue their travel by road. Public interest would be served by reducing VFR-into-IMC accidents, it said.  People don't rationally decide to continue VFR into IMC. They either:  * don't realise that they've crossed the invisible line from VMC into IMC until it's too late. * make a totally irrational decision to press on into IMC because they're more worried that they might be late than that they might be *the late*, because they are worried about getting into trouble for getting caught out by the weather, or because they think that they're so good that the rules don't apply to them anymore.  Neither of these constituencies will be materially affected by the slight reduction in incremental cost and inconvenience which a roadable aeroplane offers them should they make the rational decision to land and continue by road.  Furthermore, people whose go/no-go decision is impacted by this sort of thing really shouldn't hold flying licenses in the first place.  I'm afraid that, much as I'd love to live in the future and all, I don't think that this sort of machine is a good idea, especially as a LSA. Folding wings add a decidedly non-trivial element of complexity to the design, and chucking 20 hour pilots into the mix seems like asking for trouble to me.  People will rapidly start treating it like a car, neglecting pre-flight checks of airframe (in particular the flying surfaces, which are at risk of road-rash as well as hangar/garage rash), engine &amp; prop, weather &amp; NOTAMs, flying outside the weight &amp; balance limits etc., and after the Darwin awards are handed out, the only beneficiaries will be the lawyers.  The other thing which slightly worries me is that it will almost certainly have very considerable aerodynamic directional stablility on the ground, so driving it in a cross-wind might be *extremely interesting*. The lack of electronic stability control on the road is therefore a bit alarming.  Also, the submission seems to be in violation of basic mathematics:  &gt; Terrafugia stated that the Transition¬Æ will cruise in the air at approximately 105 miles per hour and maintain highway speeds on the ground, while attaining between 25 and 40 miles per gallon in flight and on the road.  Yet the brochure says it'll burn 5 gph at 93 knots, i.e. 18.6 ampg.  It's all very well to suggest that using Mogas might be better for the environment than 100LL, but what will happen when somebody accidentally puts 100LL in the tanks?  I'd also be rather interested to learn how they plan to overcome the differences in standard control for cars and aeroplanes (so that e.g. people don't apply a boot full of right rudder instead of opening the throttle). Given that Harrier pilots periodically crash due to grabbing the wrong lever, it seems inevitable that 20 hour pilots will not be immune, especially given that their driving and flying environments will be identical with the exception of these control strategy differences...  **TL;DR** I'm not sure that this is such a great idea...

The only output of the clinical trial they mention on the website appears to be a Master's thesis (PM me if you want the PDF) which shows that it did nothing quantitative although some of the participants felt better. The abstract reads: &gt;This study compared the effects of electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) to volitional exercise on the tone of the buttocks muscles, hip circumference, and perceived satisfaction with the buttocks region. Seventy-two females, ages 20 and 60 years, were randomly placed into one of three groups: control, exercise, or stimulation. The exercise group performed 3 sets of 10 quadruped hip extensions with each leg, 5 days per week, for 6 weeks. The stimulation group underwent stimulation for 30 minutes, 5 days per week, for 6 weeks using the Slendertone¬Æ Bottom Toner. Subjects were tested at baseline, 4 weeks, and 6 weeks. Muscle tone of the buttocks was measured using a Myotonometer¬Æ. Hip girth was measured using a spring-loaded tape measure and body satisfaction was determined using a series of questionnaires. Results were compared to a control group. **There were no improvements in hip circumference or muscular tone. The exercise and stimulation group had significant improvements in score on both the Shape Evaluation and Body Satisfaction Questionnaires.** When Overall Results questionnaires were summarized, 92% of subjects in the exercise group and 88% of subjects in the stimulation group felt that they had positive results following the 6-week study.   Similar techniques have been used in medical studies to improve patient recovery [1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20592480),[2](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20091621) but appear not to be entirely efficacious. There is also [this](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1724878/pdf/v038p00505.pdf) report in which someone appears to have overused a similar device and caused [rhabdomyolysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhabdomyolysis) (muscle breakdown). So I would be **very** careful using it.  Additionally, if you are obese apparently they have to [up the current density or electrode size](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=electronic%20muscle%20stimulation%20obesity) to get through thick fat layers, likely making it more uncomfortable (as fat is a great insulator).

The way I see it he was just trying to help the clan actually and things when out of control when A LOT of people started saying that this whole thing was his fault, of course, he read that and snapped, specially after trying to help karma, he already said hes sorry and yes I saw his broadcasts and tried to talk to him to calm him down and show that everything was actually ok, no reason to be upset.  Idk about you guys but I see it like we faced a clan that had no organization at all, started to gather members the day of the CW and we had our groups with different skill levels and all, and they had just a bunch of players.  May I remind you that KarmaPolice was 4-0 in group 2? he was going to all kill, he was going to defeat every single korean in our group. But looks like that was too much for Han to handle, so they sent a master player to play diamonds. That was really even, BIG PROPS TO KPO FOR WHAT HE DID AND HOW HE DID IT!  After the game against beeks I tried to ask the guys to dont count that game because he was platinum and wasnt in our group and was a missunderstanding, of course, they said no, I guess they really wanted that win huh? so much to throw a master to play because ""they didn't had no more diamonds"", too bad i started checking profiles and found 2 that havent played in group 2.  Ok I guess that win meant too much for them, the one last thing that was kinda dissapointing for me, is that i had to wait for 3 and half hours, first just watching Kpo destroying and then they playing with a master and i didnt even got the chance to play, and again, I dont feel like that was Beeks fault cause he took my place, I appreciate what you did bro and glad you were fighting for Karma, but again, I know I'm not much but I wanted to try my best against this guy.

t5_2qq65,bravado,1309979732,"I thought I'd go big for Canada Day this year with a super rare bottle of 30 Year Old Alberta Premium. It's a 100% rye (one of the last in Canada) and the 25yo expression years ago disappeared from shelves within hours.  Alberta Distillers are a bit of a legend here since they make the last 2 100% rye whiskies in Canada and have always packaged them in the cheesy 70s decanter-like bottle you see above. They are also quite notable among Canadian whisky snobs for their remarkable prices. The typical 6yo AND 10yo bottles sell for $24, while the 25yo went for 30$ and this 30yo bottle went for the ridiculous price of $50.  This is my first whisky that is older than myself, and based on the incredibly long finish (on a rye, no less!) I can see why people scour the globe for old whiskies.  I'll avoid spamming r/scotch with non-scotch whisky stuff in the future, but I couldn't help myself after trying this bottle.

t5_2qh4r,necromanser,1310038644,"**THE HERTZIAN CONSPIRACY**  ""In late 1864, James Clerk Maxwell published his epic material on electromagnetic waves. His material dealt not only with electrical and magnetic waves, but also the relativistic/ethereal psychoactive component of these waves (representing electromagnetics of the second order and above). The equations also included transformations that enabled the change from inertial frames of reference to non-inertial frames of reference. Maxwell's original equations were written in Quaternion notation, a complex mathematical system available at that time before Vector Analysis was introduced by Oliver Heaviside. Today's generalized equivalent of Quaternions is Tensors.  ""In short, Maxwell's original work gave the necessary information for gravitational propulsion and psychoactive devices. Someone somewhere recognized this, for shortly after his death, the mathematician Oliver Heaviside, the chemist Willard Gibbs, and physicist Heinrich Hertz decided to ""edit"" or ""interpret"" Maxwell's famous equations which were, in the original form, the foundations of electromagnetics and Unified Field Theory (UFT). This ""unholy trio"", especially Heaviside, disregarded the Quaternions or Scalar components of Maxwell's original equations, because they represented potentials and not fields. He thought potentials were akin to ""mysticism"", because ""everybody knows"" that fields contain mass, and mass cannot be created from apparently nothing, which is what potentials are, both literally and mathematically; they are an accumulation or reservoir of energy. Furthermore, not only did they throw away the gravitational component with the Quaternion/Scalar, but also postulated that gravitation and electromagnetism were mutually exclusive, not interdependent. That was the death blow to subsequent efforts by scientists to realize a functioning unified field theory. Because of this one act, electromagnetism was reduced from its original five dimensions to only four: X, Y, Z, and time. The element of G was removed.  ""Because of this deliberate act, twenty-two other errors exist today in electromagnetic theory. The very concepts of force, mass and charge are ill-defined, and the so-called ""static"" electrical charge has been discovered by Quantum mechanics not to be static at all, but to move rotationally by virtue of the quantum mechanical spin. Finally, adding insult to injury, the so-called ""imaginary components"" of Maxwell's original equations as well as the mutilated version of the equations have also been discarded or ignored. With this last error, the door to hyper-spacial domains was forever closed, for the present mathematics and physics of electromagnetic theory do not allow for hyper-spacial domains (domains outside of three dimensions), superluminal signals (signals that exceed the speed of light or are infinite in speed), and a unified field theory.  ""The edited version of Maxwell's work, which every physicist and engineer has had to contend with, discards electrogravitation, and avoids the unification of gravitation and electromagnetics. It also prevents the direct engineering of gravitation, space-time, time flow rates, free energy devices, and quantum changes, which is viewed by the altered equations that are vector-based as only a statistical change. The quaternion approach captures the ability to utilize electromagnetics and produce local curvature of space-time. Heaviside wrote a subset of Maxwell's equations where this capability is excluded.  ""Dr. Henry Monteith has independently discovered that Maxwell's original quaternion theory was a unified field theory. Einstein assumed, because he only had access to the altered equations, that curving space-time could only be achieved by the weak gravitational force due to mass, that the local frame would always be a Lorentz frame, which would mean that all operations would be constrained to ""conservation laws of physics"".  ""In the 1960's the Hertz (Hz) replaced Cycles Per Second. Since, then everyone thinks that all electromagnetic waves are hertzian. Only the upper portion of the spectrum before Infrared contains Hertzian waves. ELF and ULF are not; waves in biosystems and natural phenomena are not Hertzian in nature."" ¬© Valdemar Valerian.

t5_2qpp6,NeoDestiny,1310087268,"Speed's incredibly frustrating to listen to because he's very similar to Idra in the way that he delivers his message - usually wrapped up in some incredibly narcissistic package, following a really bad loss.  Anyway, here's a response, since the e-mail got made public.  -  &gt;So after watching your game earlier with a Terran that clearly knew what he was doing, dropping everywhere, making ghosts, using snipe, getting bases and stuff; I've come to the conclusion that you are just really bad. You really should take that replay and analyze it a bit because there was so much you could've done better.  Believe it or not, I understand a lot of my problems going from game to game.  I don't have to sit and analyze a replay to understand that my third being late is the reason why I'm floating 1k minerals, or that floating 1k/1k at 12 mins into the game and then losing to a push is bad.  My problems in the games Speed are referring to, however, all involve me getting put behind by some form of early harass.  I understand my problems and try to fix them from game to game.  That being said, it's impossible to completely fix a problem in between 1 game.  I really, really enjoy being able to play against someone who beats me 6 games in a row because it gives me a lot to work on and think about.  The person who 6-0ed me yesterday is going to become a new training partner, until I can do the same to her.  &gt;The first time you lost your 3rd I actually predicted in chat ""Hey watch him make infestors 20 seconds late and die to a push because he doesn't have infestors in time"", and guess what happened... Everything you did seemed (and I assume was) ""by feel"" and not by any precise timing, as such, your upgrades were later than should be, your infestors were later than should be, your expansions were later than should be.   It's important not to analyze a replay incorrectly, and to be mindful of your mistakes, but it's even more important to understand how to analyze the mistakes you're making.  If you play a game and lose after making a critical error like losing your third base, you don't even need to watch the rest of the replay.  You need to FIX LOSING YOUR THIRD.  Anything that happens after that is irrelevant.  Obviously timings/upgrades are going to be off after something game-shattering like that occurs.  &gt;Another thing that really annoys me is that you keep floating thousands upon thousands of minerals, yet you are reluctant to get extractors on your bases immediately or even try what I suggested: bases solely for gas until having base mined out. I'm sure you want to, but you either hesitate to do it, or you are not good enough to remember to, I seriously hope the former.  I've actually improved on the floating thing quite a bit recently, especially in ZvP and ZvZ.  My ZvT is still a little shaky at points because I'm jut not sure what units to make, but I still don't think I'm floating TONS of resources at all points in the game, except for when I'm in awkward situations.  &gt;I don't even try to go into other, more subtle points like gas timings, getting overlord before drone or drone before overlord, because I know you will never consider such fine things since you're all about that core play... which is why you are very INCONSISTENT.  The reason I'm inconsistent is because I don't play enough good games against good players.  I also make poor strategical decisions at certain points in games.  My mechanics are actually one of the strongest aspects of my play, so it's pretty annoying when people say ""oh, he has bad macro"" just because my third/fourth timings are so much different than other people's.  People also say things like ""Idra has sick macro!"" when in reality, he just takes thirds and drones them incredibly quickly, sometimes at a detriment to himself when it comes to surviving certain early pressure.  &gt;You keep trying to make the perfect build that works against everything and keep adding stuff making it more and more loose, and I guess that's ok, but on the other hand you do stupid shit like keeping 10 infestors under the terran army for 15 seconds and then when he scans TO CLEAR CREEP you rage at how lucky his scan was, even though it was 100% predictable, as I predicted in chat (like the priorly-mentioned late infestors). Do you want to know why it's predictable? Because you do it all the time and it is entirely avoidable. Catz has told you multiple times to not do that... but I guess I shouldn't bring Catz in the discussion since his play is sloppy as hell too. And then people whine that Zerg is underpowered and weak and shit.. pfft.  I think my infestor play is pretty sloppy sometimes.  Sometimes my micro/control are incredibly good, other times I just make poor decisions.  Sending all infestors to certain spots is necesary sometimes.  The game Speed is referencing, however, was not to clear creep, it was just an incredibly lucky scan.  The Terran even admitted it at the end of the game, he was just scanning ahead of his army before a push and caught the tail-end of 1 infestor, then a second scan revealed all 10.  I think it's reasonable to be able to expect to burrow and sneak infestors by an army with no ravens, as Terrans can't perpetually scan the ground around their army.  &gt;I am seriously not going to fucking take example from any more ""high level"" zergs since I've come to the conclusion that they all suck dick at the game, with a few exceptions. Fuck this game, fuck this meta-game, fuck all the whining and crying and raging over stupid shit when obviously the problem is with the players, not the game. I can't wait for Day9 to actually get good at the game and show people how to tighten their shit up.  Agreed, for the most part.  &gt;Right now, it's really fucking sad... remember when we used to make fun of people like Acergame and how they still won even though they were horrible, just because they were Terran? Well right now I feel like you are winning just because of infestors and it makes me emotionally confused.  I think some T's don't respond to it well, but it's also fairly difficult to respond to correctly.  I don't feel like my play is gimmicky, but I do feel that some people respond incredibly poorly to it.  &gt;You know how I always bash on Morrow how he is a stupid player and always does stupid shit and that I hate him and what not, that is totally true, but his shit is fucking tight as fuck, his macro is amazing and he wins even when he fucks up hardcore just because his fundamentals are top notch from his Terran play and shitton of practicing BUILDS and TIMINGS instead of general play. You, however, I regard as a smart player, that wins games by out-witting your opponents and doing fancy shit, but you execute everything VERY POORLY, which is why you lose against people like Pride, Fuzer and who else, because they have a one-dimensional play. You cannot outwit them, there's no way you can do that since they do the same thing regardless and they are in their little turtle shell until the end of the game. The only way to beat them is by just having perfect fundamentals up until mid-game.   I disagree with this.  I think ""average"" spectators are really quick to look at a Z who very quickly takes 3-4 bases and say ""WOW, HIS MACRO IS GOOD!""  Good macro =/= taking lots of bases and droning quickly.  My execution is very good, the only thing off in my play atm is just some strategic decisions I make, and responding to early pressures in different ways.  I don't lose to players like Pride/Fuzer because my execution is bad, I just lose to coin flip builds.  My execution vs those players is generally close to perfect because it's still in the early game and managing 2 bases perfectly isn't very difficult.  To say that ""fundamentals"" determine your ability to beat a high-risk, coin-flip build is a bit misleading, I would say.   &gt;Just imagine for a minute how glorious it would be if you used your builds, your tactics, your awesomeness at the level of precision that some other players do. You would be twice the player you are now.  My precision isn't the problem, though, it's some strategic decisions I make in the mid-game.  &gt;With a huge ""Fuck you and get better!"", &gt;Speed &gt;/rant  I love you, Speed.  ‚ô•",216166,31260,0,0,1,1,‚ô•

t5_2qm7u,Nienordir,1310126582,"That's what I hate about baseball. People like to drink a lot of beer during games (probably to much) and then there's the excitement to catch a ball, both might impair their ability to judge the risk and the ballpark owners _know_ this.  It's a fun sport that should be _fun_, yet many accidents happen every year, some even deadly like this one..completely unacceptable that spectators can get harmed like that.  The AFL is very similiar (in that probably everyone wants to catch a football), but they have proper netting near the endzones, and still the stands behind them are filled like any other place.  I don't get why baseball tradition overrides safety. One of the ballparks has a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• flagpole in centerfield. So safety nets around the outfield (in case someone drops) should be fine, even if it interferes with some plays either that or fences above the railing, same with nets that protect from line drives, can't tell that the reduced 'experience' is worth more than the life or sight of a spectator, that only wants to have a fun day, especially since most people won't even be able to react to a really fast ball. Most players on the field don't even use the coach boxes or on deck circles, because they know they're way to close to the zone that sees ridiculous line drives frequently, which brings me to the dugouts, there is no excuse why they don't have a proper netting that prevents a ball from entering them or even more actually allows someone to get killed inside them..  No, there is nothing funny about the stubborness inside baseball when it comes to safety. I wish that someone finally stands up and sues the shit out of the owners, to finally get a league wide move that improves safety to a point, where you don't risk losing your life as a guest of the ballpark.

t5_2qhbp,g3t_re4l,1310129763,"&gt;I'm mowing the lawn. Who am I trying to seduce or show off lust to?  If it's forbidden, it's forbidden, regardless of where , when or how you decide to wear it.   ------------------------------------------------------------- &gt;Exposure.  Even if they get exposed to more situations, the other factors described in relations to the physical nature of a female is still present.  -------------------------------------------------------------- &gt;Middle aged men have a 40% depression rate while women have a 25% rate. http://www.upliftprogram.com/facts_depression_men.html  That's middle aged men only compared to middle aged women, but what about the rest of the age demographic? You can't discount physical hormonal issues in females either.  ---------------------------------------------------------------- &gt;So, we live in a country that goes off of scientific fact. If a woman's natural cycle damages a woman's judgement that badly, why would we do it? Also, you failed to answer how emotions causes a woman to say yes or no to a factual question, ""Did you witness the signing of this contract?"" If you say she'll say answer out of emotions then you say that women on their periods are liars, because factual yes/no questions can't be interpreted.  It's this very scientific fact that has shown the different stresses women are experiencing due to hormonal and physical changes. But due to things such as gender equality, which has taken a forefront and in reality, has been moved away from equal rights for women, to how much of a man can we make a woman.   I didn't say woman are liars, but I did say that certain hormonal and physical attributes may cause a woman not to have paid sufficient attention to the details required to be a witness, in a broad sense.   --------------------------------------------------------------- &gt;You missed my point. My question was that: if we are giving women half the power in court because of their emotions, should we lessen the power of the other emotionally impaired people? I say no naturally.  The other emotionally impaired people will be judged based on their situation. If these emotions are deemed to be a hurdle to getting an accurate and reliable testimony, then that individual will not be used as a witness.  -------------------------------------------------------------- &gt;It's been known for centuries that Matthew wasn't written by the actual apostle. Also, the Bible hasn't changed, just the exact wording. Lastly, Christian beliefs haven't changed. The churches founded by the Apostles (The Catholic Church and the Orthodox Church) have remained true to their teachings through the centuries. Joe the Preacher and his Church is not an example to be used. It's like blaming a Sunni for doctrinal actions of a Shia.  So if Mathew wasn't written by an actual apostle, and no one knows how wrote Mathew, how does anyone accept it?   *""Also, the Bible hasn't changed, just the exact wording""* , this statement is incorrect and you know it. There are portions of the bible that have been removed, and wording has been changed in numerous places. Not only that, no one knows the correct bible because the original text is no longer there. It's also interesting that a supposed Muslim, that you claim to be, is defending the Bible not having been changed?  Look at [Mathew 18:11](http://bible.cc/matthew/18-11.htm), why does this verse not appear in the following versions ?  New International Version (¬©1984)  New Living Translation (¬©2007)  English Standard Version (¬©2001)   It is because they say it is an interpolation.  ------------------------------------------------------------ &gt;"" Those who follow the Messenger (Mohammed), the Prophet who can neither read nor write, whom they will find described in the Torah and the Gospel (which are) with them (7:157 MP). And when there cometh unto them (Jews) a Scripture (the Qur'an) from Allah, confirming that in their possession (2:89 MP)"" This is a false statement, and if God is wrong once, that means it can't be God. Also, much of the information in that book was known by the Greeks. For example, the fact that iron came from the sky.  Again, you need to know the bible in order to know the truth. [Here are the portions of the Bible that mention the Prophet Mohammed (saw).](http://www.islam101.com/religions/christianity/mBible.htm)  Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) is mentioned by name in the [Song of Solomon chapter 5 verse 16](http://hebrewoldtestament.com/B22C005.htm). The original Hebrew text is provided as well as the transliteration and if you look at this word ""MChMDYM"". This word doesn't even exist in the Hebrew language, so they not knowing that it's a name, translated it incorrectly.  ------------------------------------------------------------ &gt;How do you know it's Jesus talking about God? Jesus was saying that even before Abraham was, he existed. How do I know this? Because in the next verse the Jews were picking up rocks to stone him with.  Look at the verses I gave from Exodus.  [3:13] And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What is his name? what shall I say unto them? [3:14] And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you.  Why didn't the Isrealites ever accuse Moses of blasphemy when he gave the very same ""I AM"" to them? It's because they knew what questions they had, and it was an answer. They had asked for a name, and Moses provided it. But the translators, didn't understand this, so they translated it as ""I AM"". Look at what God tells Moses to tell the Isrealites who sent him *"" I AM hath sent me unto you""*. Think about it, they ask for a name, and God says ""I AM"", does that make sense? Did they ask what God was? NO, they asked for a name.  When Jesus gave them the very same name, the Jews didn't understand it, so they said he blasphemed, not understanding that Jesus was saying.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------- &gt;Matthew 27:46 is a reference to Psalm 22:1. You can read more here: http://bible.cc/matthew/27-46.htm  So? How does it make sense, that you claim Jesus is the ""Word"", which God says in John 1:1, *""and the Word was God""*, so who was Jesus crying out to and if Jesus was being killed, was God being killed, and who was looking after the Heavens when God wasn't there? Also, are you claiming that God committed suicide?  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- &gt;Himself. He was talking to himself basically. It's complicated. The incarnation was speaking to home base. Or, for example with the Our Father, it was an example for us.  What? seriously? Jesus was talking to himself? So supposedly, Jesus came to die on the cross for everyone's sins, sounds like suicide because according to Christians, Jesus chose to do this, but then he goes and says *"" ""Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?""--which means, ""My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?""""*.   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- &gt;This son of God is very special in the sense that this guy can forgive sins. How do you answer that? The Jews respond to him that only God can forgive sins after He just forgave sins.  Where does it say that the son of God in reference to Adam, is different to the son of God reference to Jesus? Provide proof of your claims.   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- &gt;Which is why the Greek in this case is very special. It means unique and not created. When you generate by procreation that is being created. Your whole argument is English based, reread the Greek definition.  Why don't you provide the original text in Hebrew to very that the Greek translation is correct? can't do that can you? So you're at the mercy of who every translated it with what every mistakes they made. The uniqueness is already stated by the word ""only"", and begotten is already known to be an physical animal act of the lower organs, so are you saying that Jesus is the only one God had to procreate to create? He couldn't do what he did with Adam, he needed a woman for Jesus? Seriously?  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- &gt;You still need to answer Matt. 12:8; Mark 2:28; Luke 6:5 - Jesus says that He is ""Lord of the Sabbath."" He is the Lord of God's law which means He is God. Matt. 18:20 - Jesus says where two or three are gathered in His name, there He is in the midst of them. Matt. 7:21-22; Luke 6:46 - not everyone who says to Jesus, ""Lord, Lord."" Jesus calls Himself Lord, which is God.  As for these, I will provide the responses shortly, because time didn't permit, but I will try and respond shortly.          ",10040,3161,0,0,0,1,¬©

t5_2qh2b,dmetzcher,1310246675,"Sorry, but I don't have a TL;DR for this rather long comment because you mentioned several things and I did my best to reply to them all.  You've started out with a baseless accusation:  &gt;""Ps, You're kinda breaking the reddit rules by outing my personal information on here, last time I checked that was a foul.""  Incorrect, and please don't accuse me of breaking rules here, because we both know it's not true. If you post personal information *to Reddit* and someone else references *the words you wrote yourself*, they are not ""outing"" anything. You did that yourself. Surely you can see that. You're an intelligent person. You posted your age to a comment that was easily seen on the *first* page of your comment stream when viewed by anyone, whether they were logged in or not. I broke no rule. You posted personal information. In your comment to which I'm replying, you've posted more personal information. If I were to repost it in this comment, am I breaking the rules? Not at all, because you posted this personal information yourself. In fact, if I were to post your bio from the Versaries [About Us](http://www.versariesapp.com/about.html) page, that would be well within the rules, too, because *you* told us who you are and what company you work for and that company's Web site contains personal information. In other words, it's not *private* information. It's public. I believe that the rules do not allow the posting of someone's address or telephone number (or, at least, they should not allow this, even if it can be found elsewhere online, because it can lead to real-world harassment, and that's a very bad thing), and I would never post that type of information to Reddit, even if you listed it in another comment on Reddit. Your age was relevant. Your address and phone number, for example, are not.  If you want to talk about breaking rules, *spamming is not allowed*. You've posted about your app *three* times in as many weeks. Three times. The fact that you delete threads within a day after creating them because people post comments that you dislike does not make it less of a spam issue and it rightly draws the sort of criticism that I've posted today.  &gt;""The Privacy Policy is in the app under the heading 'Privacy Policy'. I didn't write it, and I'm not in charge of it.""  This is your thesis project, right? It seems like it's a company's project. If so, and if you have at least four people involved in your company, it's at least a little misleading to call it a thesis project, even if it *is* one. I understand why you did, though. It gets people to download the app because they think they are helping out a college student by testing and commenting on the app. It's a little misleading, though. You're just starting out in the world and this would normally be overlooked and written off to a lack of experience, but the fact that you delete threads and comments because they paint your application in a negative light (and, really, the comments weren't that bad in the first thread), only to re-post new threads a week later, causes everything to be called into question. Surely you can understand this. A misunderstanding is what you've called it. Fair enough, but it was brought about by your actions.  Also, if this is *your* thesis project, why are you not responsible for the privacy policy of the app itself? You seem to be washing your hands of the privacy policy. If it's your app. It's your policy. If it's *not* your app, be honest about that from the start. This is one more reason why I, and others in the past, have questioned you.  &gt;""One thread was deleted because we found a bug, another because I posted under the wrong screen name.""  Regarding the second thread that was deleted because you posted under the wrong screen name:  1. Why didn't you re-post it under the correct name when you realized that you made this mistake? Instead, you conversed with me, posting two comments in reply to mine. Maybe you realized that you posted it under the wrong account after your second comment in reply to me. Fair enough, but you never re-posted it under the correct name. What would you assume, if someone else did this? Probably that you didn't want to re-post it because I would see it and reply again with the same comments.  2. Why did you post two replies to me, then delete BOTH of them, then delete the thread itself? Why not simply leave it, especially if you weren't going to post it again under the right screen name? Surely you can see how this makes you, your app and your company look?  Regarding the first thread that was deleted because you found a bug:  1. Why does it matter that you found a bug? There were several comments that people took the time to post about your app. If you want to build trust with community members and not give them the impression that you are simply spamming them with ads, deleting posts with their comments, twice, is not the way to go. I'm sure that you can understand that deleting the thread because you found a bug in your app, after there was a lot of discussion about it, makes you look like you are trying to hide something (especially when most of the truly *negative* comments posted to that thread had to do with privacy issues -- people were rather understanding regarding the bug that didn't allow them to get past the initial screen).  2. Reddit is not your personal advertising space where you should be posting about your app and then deleting the posts later after a conversation has been started. If you want to advertise, spend $20 and buy an ad on Reddit rather than re-posting the same link to your app over and over.  &gt;""I can't answer every question about the privacy policy, because it's not my area.""  It's your app. Make it your area. When someone asks you a question, you should probably do your best to get the answer from the person who has it so that you can answer them in plain English. You tell everyone that you are a poor college student and talk about your app as a ""thesis"" project, but you apparently have someone dedicated, at your *company* (the bottom of your Web site says ""Copyright ¬© 2011 Versaries LLC""), to legal matters. ~~Is Versaries, LLC really a company registered in one of the 50 states?~~ &lt;-- Yes, registered in Ohio.  The problem is that you have behaved in a way that makes it *very* easy to suspect that you are not, as datagrim said above, on the up and up. You post an app that is clearly owned by a registered company (if the LLC is, in fact, registered somewhere), but you talk about it as if it's yours alone. Then, you delete posts when people ask questions about privacy, of all subjects (this was what *really* brought on all the criticism by me and others in the first thread you created, and everything else was secondary and only drew more suspicion). Please don't be surprised when someone calls you on it and asks for more information. As I said in my previous comment:  &gt;""When you first wrote about your app on Reddit, I thought people were being too hard on you (some of the comments had a rather nasty tone), but when I saw that you deleted the post and then re-posted it two weeks later, and then deleted it again when I asked, nicely, about your policy and what information was stored on your servers, I became suspicious...""  Anyway, this time, maybe you shouldn't delete this thread and, if you want to post about your app for a 4th time, perhaps you should buy an ad on Reddit. The cost is very low and very reasonable.  By the way, your app looks beautiful, but I've frankly been so turned off by your actions that I haven't even used it. That's why I asked about the privacy policy in my last comment to the second thread that you deleted. I wanted to know more. When you deleted the thread, I said, ""Well, I guess that settles it."" Was I wrong to feel that way? I don't think so.  ----  *Edit: Corrected a typo or three and edited the information struck out above.*",40384,6722,0,0,0,1,¬©

t5_2qh33,andytuba,1310350029,"Nifty, thanks for the link! Here's my armchair electrical engineer's understanding of the electronic pulse thing:  When you press a key on a keyboard -- for example, ""a"" -- the keyboard transmits a code -- 64 -- via the keyboard cable to the computer's motherboard as an electrical signal, which is then interpreted as the keycode and sent through the OS/software to actually become letters/hotkeys/whatever.  The signal is also emitted as radiation from the cable, which functions as a long, flexible antenna.‚úù  Therefore, you could set up another antenna with a receiver to pick up the radiation, and decode it into the actual letters typed on the keyboard.  Think of it like a crappy radio transmitter/receiver, but with keycodes instead of FM audio signal. [meyowrawr](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/ilrus/clever/c24tcd4) actually found [some guys who did this](http://lasecwww.epfl.ch/keyboard/).  ‚úù Those cables aren't particularly well-shielded; there's very little power going through them.  You could probably ""type"" letters by waving a magnet near your keyboard cable, although I wouldn't recommend it.  EDIT: From reading the article I linked to, it looks like the EM radiation comes from the keyboard itself; so if you have a wireless keyboard with its own power source, same principle applies.

t5_2sjdn,siljak,1310550697,"I work with kids with disabilities. We have a zillion guidelines in place and all the usual helpful-minded handouts and literature from charities and organisations, all of them saying how important it is to educate and inform about the effects of bullying, and how victims of bullying should deal with it etc etc.  None of it is worth a damn to the kid in the street who is being called a feeb or a mong or a retard or a spaz every day and worse, wherever they go, whatever they do. Just like you, by the time they reach their teens they have already tried every single way in the world of trying to deal with people's prejudices and seen them all fail one by one. They already know that most of the so-called anti-bullying techniques just make things worse.  When I'm talking to kids about it privately I tend to just tell them about similar shit that happened to me along the way, give them a few jokey anecdotes and try to get them to see that however sad it may be, the simple fact is that they won't see the world's attitudes change quickly enough to help them day-to-day right now, but if they keep trying their whole lives they may make it slightly better in the long run. However...   The one thing you do have the ability to change instantly is your own attitude.You can do that in a matter of days, weeks or months. So you have to start working on finding ways to prevent the depressing, demoralising, relentlessly grinding shittiness of other people effecting you. You can't change THEM, but you CAN learn to accept the sad simple fact that a huge number of the human population are ignorant arseholes. All you can do is to learn to protect yourself from letting yourself be affected by them. Learn to gauge your self-worth by the way the people you respect see you instead. Why do you care about the opinions of ignorant fuckwits?   The tricky bit is finding out what the particular way is that will help you change your own attitude to the bullying. It depends on the individual. Some people can just compartmentalise their lives, some people increase their self-worth by achieving success in some chosen field, some people do volunteer work with disabled kids to make them feel they have at least one thing worthwhile to contribute to the world (well - it worked for me ‚ò∫).

t5_2s0sd,Mr_Nox,1310649555,"Day 32!  **Routines**   *Weights* - I have been doing starting strength on and off for years, but just started doing [Wendler's 5/3/1](http://forum.bodybuilding.com/showthread.php?t=112382761).  So far so good.  If I can stick with it long enough, I'd like to get back to where I was 5 years ago - benching 300+ lbs and squatting ~400 lbs.  *Running* - I was working with a running coach for 12 weeks this Spring.  The workouts progressively became longer and faster.  It basically came down to running 4-5x per week, with 1-2 easy or progressive runs, 1 quality workout (intervals, speed or hills) and 1 long run.  Worked wonders!    *Stretching* - I need to get better at this.  I have several stretching/foam rolling plans that I need to follow - both for flexibility and for health reasons.  *Diet* - decidedly paleo.  I have done Atkins in the past with great success (dropped from 205 to 175 lbs), but I feel it's non sustainable long term.  Keto appears to be very similar to Atkins.  Paleo, on the other hand, is very simple and more sustainable long-term due to fewer carb restrictions.  The goal is to not eat processed junk and focus more on low GI foods.   **YESTERDAY**  Started off as a decent day.  Ran in the morning, had a good lunch.  Then I made the mistake if having a drink on the way home on the commuter boat and all hell broke loose.  I went into carb craving overload, and had chocolate, chips, and other decidedly non-paleo food.  Now today I feel like crap - tired, bloated, can't concentrate.  Ack.  **TODAY**   No running today - day off.  If I find the energy, I'll make it down to the gym to do 5/3/1 day 2 weights (deadlift and military press).  If not, I'll sit here like a bloated sack of Nox. **‚ò†**  ",2901,1123,0,0,1,1,‚ò†

t5_2qhqb,Talonwhal,1310668835,"&gt; airsure tracking does not mean that it has some device in the package that can be satellite tracked or something - it just means that when it arrives at each point it is scanned - so it has been scanned at the office you gave it into and won't get scanned again until it arrives at the sorting office in Canada  You seem to be confusing this partially with ""International Signed For"". This service is only tracked a few times eg. when it leaves, when it arrives in the other country, and when it's been delivered.  Airsure, on the other hand has slightly more tracking, in 6 stages:   * Post Office¬Æ (for those items paid for and posted at the Post Office¬Æ branch)  * Local mail centre  * Royal Mail International processing centre  * Office of Exchange overseas  * Mail Centre overseas  * Delivery Office overseas  So the OP is quite right in assuming something has gone wrong, there *definitely* should have been tracking updates by now, there is absolutely no way this is being handled correctly regardless of the situation in Canada.  Being mis-sorted is a possibility but they are often caught even if they are mis-sorted initially, however it is possible that it hasn't been caught and has gone with the standard mail as suspected. Then it will end up in the backlog like everything else.  If it hasn't arrived in 25 days then you can claim for it, however unless you paid for additional compensation (up to ¬£500) then you're not likely to get much.. even then it's not exactly the $2000 you seem to have the potential for losing here. You shouldn't really send anything over the value of ¬£500 with this service, I guess.. but too late for that now, so...  It seems Royal Mail are being kinda unhelpful here, honestly - with Airsure and the way it's tracked they should deifnitely at least be admitting that they screwed up either at the Post Office or elsewhere. I'd try calling them or visiting the Post Office again armed with this knowledge regarding the tracking and see what they have to say. Unfortunately as I mentioned even if they lost it completely you won't necessarily get much of the value anyway (although sometimes they are quite generous). They may however be able to investigate and figure something out.  *Edit: Hey, I just realised you're the guy with some comments I read in the ¬£5 in plastic envelope thread - hey!

t5_2rxes,smocca,1310945965,"Watching through a games now, I'll give my thoughts as I have them:    *vs. HasuDrone on Typhon Peaks - I don't like your opening.  Everything you do can be fine but you are extremely susceptible to 1 base timing attacks.  I say this because you don't have ling speed, you don't have a third hatch (for mass lings), you only have two queens, you don't have a roach warren, and you don't have fast upgrades.  In other words, you don't really have anything going for you if he shows up with something tricky.  A well microed 4 gate will eat you alive. As will 3 gate+void ray and 3 gate blink stalkers.  Also, the Toss is feeling extremely safe because you can't threaten him at all off creep.  So he's free to get proxy pylons up, free to be greedy or whatever he wants.  So it turns out he's going for 3gate blink stalker and you are going to have to hold this will lings.  Here are some things that you did wrong(ish) which are going to reduce the number of lings you will have to hold this push:  -You have 24 drones mining your main base minerals and only 7 mining your nat (at 9:00). -You only have two hatches.  You cannot make enough lings off two hatches if you have two fully saturated bases.  You were floating enough minerals for a few minutes to easily get a third hatch down and if your drones were distributed better you should have enough. -You saw a bunch of stalkers+zealots and responded by making spines which is reasonable but then you went on getting more gas, getting lair, getting two evo chambers and you also ran away with the lings you had in front of his base.  You have to figure out immediately if he's doing a 1 base attack and if that is the case you just can't afford to be teching so much.  When he is doing a build like this, all of those resources should be going into staying alive. -You made 5 spines and then a few more later.  I like spines, but having a third hatch and third queen and MASS ling is going to be so much better.  I prefer maybe a few less spines and a lot more lings.  Despite all that, you died with 2k/1.5k banked.  So basically your opening gives your opponent this nice window where you are on ling tech (slowling tech, no roach warren, and no upgrades), you are massing drones and you don't have the production capacity to make mass ling if/when you need to.  It just leaves you extremely vulnerable to any sort of 1 base timing attack especially one with tech.  You might do okay vs. 4 gates simply because you usually have to cut drones earlier (and so two hatches+two queens is enough to make pure ling) but this is a later attack that relies on poking in, taking shield damage and then backing out.  He's going to accumulate units until you have a force that can smash his face in.  Given the size of your economy, you'd easily be able to make such a force if you had the production to match.  tl;dr start making a 3rd hatch and and probably a 3rd queen if you want to rely on lings or make an earlier roach warren. Rely less on spines (I ‚ô• spines but I don't think they are enough by themselves).     *Veto Backwater Gulch, Slag Pits and Delta Quadrant (LOL... but seriously though they are awful maps).     *vs. Jason on Shakura's - Weird build from him, he ends up going for 4gate+twilight+robo all on one base.  Your drone distribution can be better again (23 on main and 5 on nat minerals @ ~7:00).  Again your minerals start piling up for a bit since your opening takes a late gas and you're not getting any buildings or anything (3rd queen though, nice).  You see this guy has 4 gates, a twilight council and a robo all on one base (lol) and you go ahead with mass gas, 2 evos and lair tech.  1 evo and possibly the lair are good for safety but this guy is basically all-in.  You can't go ahead with your build like normal.  You are SO far ahead of this guy economically.  All you have to do is be alive in a few mins and it's going to be an easy win.  Only get tech that is necessary to hold whatever attack he may do (like if he tries to get really tricky and grab a dt shrine) and then make the units you need to stay alive.  Your mechanics are good, you're not missing injects much and you are using your larva but it's basically the same story as the other game.  You are on nothing but ling tech and don't have the production capacity to utilize your economy.  Either get a roach warren earlier or get another hatch.  Anyway, this guy's build was so awful that you easily beat it because 4gate+charge+robo+immortals off of one base just means he has like 10 units for his 10:00 timing attack.  tl;dr - Earlier roaches or an early 3rd hatch.  Less tech when you see he is doing a 1 base timing attack.    *vs. SumGai on Shakura's - You taok too much gas too early.  ZvZ especially is extremely punishing of bad macro.  When you end up with like 500 gas and nothing to spend it on that can be SO MANY DRONES.  Anyway, his macro was much worse than yours.  You just didn't have an OL positioned outside of his base to see his 17 lings move out.  As a result, those lings did way too much damage and then he followed it up with a roach/ling attack which you again missed until it was on your side of the map.  Work on that OL positioning and try to tighten up your opening so that you are only getting gas as you need it (and using the excess minerals well).   ---  GL, hope some of this helped!   edit: holy shit wall of text.  sorry lol",32790,43326,0,0,1,1,‚ô•

t5_2qhba,SkyMuffin,1311001428,"**Did you ever get closure from your brother?**  No, not yet. Or maybe not ever. I have come to realize that forgiveness is much more about forgiving yourself than the other person-- my brother no longer has power over me, and so to hinge my health and healing on him is to give up my self control. I would like to someday talk to him and to my mother honestly about this, but I don't think that any of us are ready yet. It may be years before we can.  **Did your family ever believe you or do anything about the abuse?**  I know that my mother believed me, but because she was in a tough economic/racial situation (see responses to question #6 above), she had to act as if she didn't. I don't think my brother realized fully what he was doing at the time. Because my family is so small (literally 3 people including myself), there was no way the abuse could ever happen again after it was revealed.   **Has this affected your adult relationships?**  Yes. I'll quote the response I posted in the other thread:  &gt;I have been blessed to have (so far) two partners after I fully realized what happened to me who were really open and understanding. The first came from a very sheltered, privileged background, but she was open and really cared more about me as a person, and not any outside stereotypes. It was, however, hard on our relationship because she couldn't understand my experience or why I sometimes felt unsafe/like a terrible person for ""no reason at all"". She did tell me that my blog has helped her to understand a lot. The second person (whom I am currently still with) was also abused as a child, and so we try to help each other. Her situation was much more extreme than mine, but we both deal with issues of PTSD and safety when it comes to love and sex.  &gt;My mother has read my blog-- I accidentally revealed it to her-- and now I regularly talk about it openly on my Facebook. I have not heard anything from her except one comment about how there is nothing wrong with me, she loves me very much, etc. I think that she is still trying to deal with/understand this for herself. I get the feeling that we are a bit distant currently because she does not know how to approach it. I don't know if my brother has seen my blog, but I do wonder/worry about him. I still care about him even though he hurt me, but I don't know if I am ready to talk to him yet. I think that he needs counseling/therapy but I don't know if he is doing that.  &gt;On Facebook in general, I don't generally see much response from people-- maybe because I am a bit of a recluse. I am friends with mostly women in real life, and most are very understanding. Sometimes I meet people and share this with them, and they just disappear afterwards without saying much. I think maybe it scares them, but who knows? Maybe it's just regular drifting apart.  &gt;I only have a few friends who are men, but I am close to them-- they have heard some parts of my story, but they generally don't empathize much. The most I have heard from my best friend who is a guy is that ""you are so much braver than me"", which does mean a lot. However, it is harder to talk about these things with other men in person. I have wanted to tell a professor who is a role model/mentor of mine for some time, but I don't know how to approach it.  I am generally much more cautious about the people, especially men, that I allow into my life. I am still trying to figure out how to have male role models and male friends in my life and not see them as a source of danger.  I have also struggled some with even being attracted to men at all, despite considering myself pansexual, just because the thought of a penis terrified me for awhile. I used to really loathe my own penis, too-- my first sexual partner helped me to overcome that a lot.  **How many of your present problems do you believe are partially or fully caused by your past trauma?**  When I was younger (around the time of the abuse) I had a lot of problems with Binge Eating Disorder, which is finally official in the DSM. I would have episodes of overeating, feel incredibly guilty, and gain weight. It was definitely an emotional cause/a poor coping mechanism. I don't do it as often but I have to be careful.  Around the same time, I suddenly started [pulling my hair](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trichotillomania) regularly, and eventually I had bald spots in various places (including between my legs and my armpits). The Trich mysteriously phased itself out after a year or two, although I do it sometimes.  I occasionally make impulse purchases, and I have a (somewhat) compulsive need to collect certain things, but I'm not sure how much of that is influenced by what happened. I do deal with some symptoms of PTSD (nightmares, safety issues, reaction to loud noises or people, fear of small spaces), but they don't happen all of the time, or at least not in extremes. Maybe a few times a week. Sometimes when the issue of sexual abuse comes up in public or social situations I get very claustrophobic and I suddenly feel as if everyone in the room is out to get me.   I am still struggling with having productive, safe coping skills and stress management-- usually when I am stressed, I ""shut down"" and ignore the problem(s), making it worse. This is bad for homework mostly, but I've had a lot of understanding professors.  **You are very brave to do this and I hope you can overcome any way that these awful events affect your adult life.**  Thank you. ‚ô• ",12780,21700,0,0,0,1,‚ô•

Examples of innovative segmentation models To fulfill future segmentation requirements, psychographic and behavior-based models become significant. Characteristics such as lifestyle, values, social standing, media usage, buying patterns, brand preference, product usage pattern, and the like can be used to describe customer groups. One example for a state-of-the-art segmentation model is the Sinus-Milieus¬Æ approach, which clusters homogeneous groups by shared aspirations in life, value systems and lifestyles. When individuals share similar life contexts, they are likely to be part of the same milieu. The model distinguishes several milieus and builds a quantitative conclusion through a representative sample of the given population.

It is quite common to target a small but highly watched/respected/followed group with the goal of gaining influence over those that ""follow"".

t5_2qh1i,CoyoteGriffin,1311357217,"https://rational.org/index.php?id=1  &gt;When Lois and I decided to create a better path to addiction recovery back in 1985, it seemed we could improve on what already existed ‚Äî the recovery group movement and its business arm, the addiction treatment industry. We launched a network of recovery groups based upon the idea that addiction is a psychological hangup which can be overcome through group discussions of psychology. We linked strongly with the addiction treatment industry by recruiting hundreds of professional counselors to oversee local groups.  &gt;The network spread into a thousand cities, and participants in recovery joined together in the evenings, away from their families, socializing with other local substance abusers. They kept coming back year after year in a quest for sobriety based upon emotional comfort, inner peace, self-understanding ‚Äî plus the far-off hope of eventually resuming a moderate degree of self-intoxication.   &gt;Finally it became obvious that nothing had really changed, that Rational Recovery groups based upon psychology were simply a different flavor of a ‚Äúspiritual‚Äù doctrine created long ago by and for addicted people. Group facilitators even boasted of causing ‚Äúhumanist conversions,‚Äù meaning the agenda reached far beyond defeating addiction into evangelistic atheism.  &gt;Having been seriously addicted for many years myself, I finally understood that any means of recovery devised by addicted people will necessarily preserve and extend addiction. The RR groups had merely substituted humanistic psychology for religion, and perpetuated the addict-centered approach we now call recoveryism. This piercing insight brought about the end of the Rational Recovery groups as well as severance from the addiction treatment industry.  &gt;Rational Recovery today is family centered. Our flagship, Addictive Voice Recognition Technique¬Æ (AVRT¬Æ), is based upon universal family values, and the addicted family member gets only the support which his own family sees fit to provide. Often this means no support, which is fine, because addicts are not disease victims but traitors to their families who must earn respect through prolonged abstinence.",24387,371,0,0,1,1,¬Æ

I used one of those single blade Bic razors, I think I got 12 for .99.  The stand was free because I made it http://www.instructables.com/id/Make-Your-Own-Razor-and-Shaving-Brush-Stand/#step1  The brush, bowl and soap I got from Rite Aid for $5.99 for everything (regularly 10, it would have been worth it!)  The Real Shaving Co stuff was $4, regularly 5 I think.  It's pretty awesome!  I also own C.O. Bigelow  (proraso) and it's nice, but I think after 3 passes and a preshave the eucalyptus gets to be a bit much (it can irritate skin or eyes)  Personally I love the smell of eucalyptus, and there's an addition scent in there that I'm not sure on.  Not bad in any way though.  If somebody wanted to get into this way of shaving for the cheap I would probably say RSC cream, vintage Gillete, Tweezerman brush, 10$ sample blade pack.  And then some form of aftercare.  I've got 3 products in house right now,  Gillete after shave balm, the ever popular Nivea, and the ever awesome Baxter of California after shave balm as well.  I would say if you're going to splurge on ONE thing in shaving..aftercare is it.  And the Baxter was a much larger tube than I expected for the price...so really not that expensive!  I started out my wet shaving career using the single blade bics, VDH soap, mug, and brush.  Gillete (the cheapest I own) after shave balm.  I had 0 nicks or cuts, 1 weeper that didn't have to be treated at all, and my skin was pretty much on fire.  Do keep in mind that I grew a beard for 6 weeks less than a week before so I expected my sensitive skin to be irritated.  After a week of this I stepped up to the RSC/COB soaps, and tried nivea and baxter.  They made the experience nicer, but my skin had mostly cleared up just from being used to the routine, as well as the excellent pre and post care really healing my skin!‚ô¶",164317,2598,0,0,0,1,‚ô¶

t5_2qi32,bamboozelle,1311400119,"I haven't been to a lot of the restaurants in Knoxville.  All the restaurants listed here are locally owned or chains originating in this area.  I'm all about supporting the local economy.    * Best Italian:  Naples.  They have very interesting specials, and it's one of the few places where I regularly order the specials.  Their ""classic"" Italian pasta dishes like the manicotti and cannelloni are wonderful.  I often get my roomie to order one, and I get the other, so we can mix the flavors.  Yummmmmnomnomnom.  * Best Chinese: Hong Kong House.  Their dishes are remarkably authentic, but they also have American Chinese food, and the best lao mien and pan-fried noodles.   * Best Gyro:  I know eff-all about Mediterranean cuisine, but Mediterranean Delight in Oak Ridge makes the best gyro.  It is in an old office complex, and you can barely tell it's there.  The venue is shabby, but delivers the best damn gyro I have ever eaten.  The bread was super thin and perfectly grilled, oh I just can't describe, the way it was rolled all together, the layers.  Fantastic and subtly different than other gyros, and it's for the better.  A notable second is Nero's on campus.   * Best Fine Dining:  RouXbarb on Northshore.  Their menu is seasonal and changes often.  It's wonderful.  Sit at the Chef's Table, and bring beer for the chef.  He'll take excellent care of you.  Peerless is also very nice.   * Best Mexican:  this is tough.  El Charro is a staple of Knoxville, for their 2-taco lunch special if nothing else, but is sometimes inconsistent.  I also have come to like SoccerTaco in Market Square, but not so much the Bearden location.  I've also come to be a big fan of the carne asada soft tacos at Cancun's off Cedar Bluff (and they actually have a proper bar).  * Best Pizza:  also tough.  Big Ed's Pizza is legendary in this area.  I can't even think of anyone I know that doesn't **love** Big Ed's.  Great crust, and pizza is consistently awesome every time.  Roman's in Windsor Square has been a perennial favorite of mine for close to 15 years (NY style, but not as thin as it could be).  I ‚ô• NY Pizza is decent, but the sauce/cheese/crust proportions are not my favorite, but it's good quality and very tasty.  The venue is also fun.  Dazzo's on Gay Street makes damn fine thin crust NY style pie, and it is fast becoming one of my favorites, second only to Ed's.  Can you tell I like pizza? * BBQ:  TD's makes the best Brunswick Stew I have ever eaten and I used to live in Savannah so I've had all kinds.  OMG it's so amazing.  M&amp;M Catering can work a pork butt on a smoker, for sure, but last time I went it was still take-out only.  But please don't let that stop you.   Calhoun's is a local favorite also, but I prefer their lemon grilled chicken.  They used to have a dynamite happy hour M-F with $1.85 home-brewed pints, but I haven't hung out there in a while so I don't know if that's still going on.  They do have trivia games that draw a lot of people.  * Best Steak:  Ye Old Steak House knows how to handle a cut of meat, and they cook a steak to proper temperature as ordered.  Casual venue, but the menu is all √† la carte and a wee pricey, but I'd guess it's a better value than Ruth's Chris (I have never eaten at Ruth's Chris).  I also really like The Chop House (excellent chops of beef, pork veal, and lamb).  Peerless is quite good also.   * Best Southern comfort foods:  Big Fatty's in Bearden.  Fantastic dishes, not a one of them any good for you, except for your taste buds.  * Best Casual Dining:  Pul√©o's Grille.  They make incredible white bean chicken chili, and you can almost guarantee that everyone will find things that they like.     * Others:  Restaurant Linderhof in Farragut is fun and good food if you have time to waste (their service is not terribly snappy).  There are Ethiopian joints on Sutherland and in Farragut.  My roomie has praised them both.  If you're craving Thanksgiving dinner any time of year, hit up Owen's on Kingston Pike near Pellissippi.    **TL,DR:**  RouXbarb, Hong Kong House, Pul√©o's, Big Ed's, Naples, Big Fatty's,  Ye Olde Steak House, the Chop House",7442,3677,0,0,0,1,‚ô•

Narrated by William Shatner (Star Trek's Captain Kirk) and featuring an original score performed by the Moscow Symphony Orchestra, this award-winning documentary reveals previously unreleased and classified government footage depicting in graphic detail these powerful and awesome weapons.

Director/producer Peter Kuran, traveled throughout the U.S. to uncover footage that includes bombs being suspended by balloon, exploding under the ocean, being shot from a cannon and detonated in outer space. ""Trinity and Beyond"" features extremely rare film segments from top secret government archives and startling footage of nuclear bomb tests conducted by the United States, Russia and China, including the largest atomic explosion ever detonated. ""Trinity and Beyond"" features an interview with Dr. Edward Teller a developer of nuclear weapons and one of the most controversial figures of the 20th century.

t5_2qh1i,Neo991lb,1311613074,"So I liked to do fun outdoorsy stuff in college, and got us suckered into a mountain bike race. It was like a 3 or 5 mile track and you did certain numbers of laps based on your level of experience. Looking back, the fact that I sped off and treated it as a race instead of more like a couple's adventure ride was an asshole move because I had no chance of winning. BUT I wanted to push myself, and my then-gf told me to not worry about her, so instead of doing the race together, I sped off and ""pushed"" myself.   To say that she doesn't have too too much experience with mountain bikes would be an understatement, and the whole changing gears bit completely eluded her. So after I finished the race, I went to look for her but could not find her for seemed like an eternity. As time wore on, I started to worry that something happened (there were a few spots where it was really steep and she has a history of being on the wrong side of risky stuff). Bless her heart, turns out she had it in a high (or low?) gear so it was nearly impossible to pedal unless you were going downhill, but she still finished the race despite having to walk the bike the majority of the track (steep up and downhills, very awkward to be walking a bike).   ‚ô• that woman, just celebrated 3 years of marriage a few weeks ago.

Since I'm working at Walmart¬©, I did see the pony toys, but they looked bad so I questioned my faith in ponies.

The author's thesis is that, as feminists of the 1970s achieved the goals they appropriately sought--i.e., equality in the workplace and elsewhere in society--ideologies hardened.  Young disputes the feminist belief that the personal is political; what's personal is personal, she claims, and the battle for equal rights is not an excuse for portraying men as fundamentally malevolent."" Although feminists themselves are divided regarding various issues--pornography, most visibly--they share, according to the author, ""a propensity for sweeping statements based on modest evidence.""  Young offers evidence that other basic feminist credos are mistaken: e.g., that male violence is directed primarily against women or that male privilege comes without any price (men die younger, she points out). Young, a journalist who describes herself as a ""dissident feminist,"" contends that rape is not a bias crime.  She also examines the men's movement, where men often take on the role of victim, and what she views as the confused response from political conservatives regarding gender roles.  The 12 steps to an egalitarian society include such seemingly innocuous (but, on examination, distinctly provocative) propositions as ""Take gender politics out of the war on domestic violence"" and ""In politics, stop treating women as an interest group and acting as if women's claims were more legitimate than mens.""

Some people might not have bought it anyway, some people buy it after trying, some people tell there friends spreading word of mouth which increases buzz/sales.  And yes a certain unknown amount would have paid for the game, but didn't because they got it for free.  The net impact is just too hard to figure out, but certainly doesn't get accurately represented by a simple ""downloaded without paying"" number.  It really doesn't matter anyway though, as piracy is just a fact, and as a developer it's more important to worry about the people who do buy your game, then losing sleep about those who don't.  No matter what you try you can't do much to stop the first group, and usually just end up making it harder on the second.  This debate will never end though as piracy provides a perfect scapegoat/boogeyman to account for less then expected/desired sales, especially for the PC who for obvious reasons, isn't as big of a market as the consoles. Regardless of actual reason, Piracy is just too easy of a target, hence all the focus, lipservice and DRM efforts.

The best part is, you don't have to show any of it to anyone-- you have the power over your words. No one else can take that away.  There are many growing online communities now that center around things like this, too. Pandora's Aquarium, Overcoming Sexual Abuse, Shareascare, and many Facebook and Tumblr communities. Tumblr especially has become very open and basically amazing for finding survivor blogs and writing by survivors. It is always good to know that you aren't alone.  ‚ô•",12780,21700,0,0,0,1,‚ô•

t5_2s9n5,Artemecion,1311956536,"Darker tastes... well, anime-wise, there's **Paranoia Agent**, **Serial Experiments Lain** (oh, holy shit, this one gets intense), and **Noir**, anime-wise. Noir's got lesbians in it. Like, all the lesbians. They don't actually get naked and do the things lesbians do, though.   Also check out **Darker Than Black**, that one's pretty awesome. I can't really explain too much of the plot without being a spoiler, but the basic premise is that cataclysmic events happened and there are people called 'contractors' who've been granted special abilities. It's pretty gritty, and every episode is packed full of awesome. **Black Lagoon** was mentioned down below, and that's like a less fantastical, less sci-fi-y version of DTB. Slightly less awesome, too, but then I might be biased.  If you've got any positive feelings towards 1920's gangster/mafia settings, check out **Baccano!**. The story's well written and you will not regret it. **Durarara!!** was written by the same author, and that explores teenage gangs and stuff in Ikebukuro, Japan, in a modern setting. Both of them have some supernormal elements, and that just makes things really awesome. (Durarara!! also has tons of yaoi shipping moments. Unf, Shizuo/Izaya. ‚ô•.)  Manga-wise, there's **Reiko the Zombie Shop**, but that's really more LOOK AT ME, I'M EDGY, AND I DRAW LOTS OF FUCKED-UP MURDERS. Though, you might like this oneshot -- http://brasscockroach.com/h4ll0w33n2007/manga/Amigara-Full/Amigara-0.html, the *Enigma of Amigara Fault*. That one was pretty damn creepy. The author's Junji Ito, so if you like that one-shot, look the rest of his stuff up. **Battle Royale** was mentioned somewhere, and you should check out all the versions of that.   **Higurashi no Naku Koro ni** was recommended, I saw, and that one's pretty gritty too.   Couple of anime movies: **Armitage III** (robots capable of reproduction), **Kakurenbo** (kids' game of hide and seek gone wrong)... and one other, and if I remember it, I will totally get back to you on that. **Steamboy** is less gritty, and more just a recommendation thrown in if you like steampunk stuff.  ...That got kinda long, I'm sorry.

I know they're just mean idiots, but honestly it doesn't change anything for me. Maybe it's because I have rather good hearing, but I don't get why they have so little selfcontrol that they won't shut up until you're out of range. I don't like anybody I see either, but still that's no reason to insult someone or to make fun of them.    I don't get insulted often, but those stupid bitches that start to giggle when you pass them are at least as mean (and usually you can tell that they don't laugh about a joke).    What's even worse is, that it ruins you for genuine nice people. I had ridiculously short hair for years (almost shaved), because I didn't give a fuck and was to lazy to make an appointment and sit there bored while getting a haircut, when I could just take one of those buzzing things to shave them off as soon as my hair reached annoying length. Later I listened to to much metal and my hair started to grow by 300% (true story :p).    I reached a phase were I could actually be considered good looking. Well, when you walk through the city and pass a group of japanese tourists and suddenly all the girls go giggling and 'woah cute~', then you made it. Which is quite cool, because suddenly you go _""not bad, maybe I'm really looking good..""_,    but unfortunately you fall into Frys Dilemma. You meet a group of cute girls and when one of them goes _""Hi!‚ô•""_, it totally throws you off when you realize that they're actually talking to you and by the time you processed that they already passed you (Cute girls, Y U wait to the last second until you say hi?). But like I said most of the time it's Frys Dilemma anyway _""Can't tell if cute girl is flirting or just making fun of me..""_.    It really sucks when you look back and realize that there were a couple of girls that had genuine interest in you (enough to actually talk to some random dude in the streets) and you shot them down like a quiet dumbass, because good stuff like that doesn't happen to you.._ever.._",15492,345,0,0,1,1,‚ô•
