t5_6,iltat_work,1294090484,"It makes me really sad that when people find out I'm from Texas, they assume that your beliefs are the type they assume I hold.   &gt;blind fanatic hatred of corporations.  No problem with corporations. Problem with putting billion dollar profits over the lives of millions of people. No need for one individual to make tens of millions of dollars in a single year at the expense of peoples' lives. Sad to think that such a thing actually is acceptable.  &gt;no credit given to the millions of lives saved by those very drugs you hate so much  So if I save many, it's okay to let many others die simply because I felt that the $20 million I made this year should be $30 million instead. Should I be able to sacrifice a million people for an extra $10 million for my pocket? That's the actual choice facing pharmaceutical companies' CEOs. Again, quite sad that choosing the money is not only an acceptable but lauded decision.  &gt;billions of dollars and years in r &amp; d and getting the approvals through the system  In one of my earlier sources (something I seem to be the only one providing), it actually shows their R&amp;D costs vs. sales. The average is approximately 5-7:1 in their favor. Now, assuming you have some type of investment, do you get a 500% return on your investment? Keep in mind that for some reason, you can still find these same drugs for sale in Mexico and Canada for **MUCH** cheaper prices, yet the manufacturers still sell them there. It's almost like the profit margins they get there are actually perfectly acceptable, they're just milking the American consumer for **FAR** more than that simply because they can. Damn, I should start supporting them more.  &gt;ill take the drug companies any day to assholes breaking down my door with ak-47's and wiping out all my friends.  There's nothing like fear-mongering to rally the masses. What are the odds of this actually occurring? Slim-to-none doesn't actually encompass how small a chance you have of this happening to you. Kind of like terrorism, that terrible plague that has such a large chance of killing you that [we should spend tons of money protecting ourselves from it.](http://reason.com/archives/2006/08/11/dont-be-terrorized) But hey, we all need a crazy sensationalized depiction to focus our hate on.  &gt;have you ever truly and honestly done the research and taken the time it would take to validate ludicrous claims like this?  [Oh](http://aids.about.com/od/hivmedicationfactsheets/a/affordable.htm) gosh, [you've](http://www.globalhealth.org/infectious_diseases/) got me [there.](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/01/AR2007030100173.html) One of us definitely didn't take the time to research whether this is actually an issue, and I'm betting it's not me.  &gt;or did you just repeat what you heard from michael moore?  Did he cover this stuff? I wasn't a big fan of how he acted during F9/11, so I haven't watched anything else he's done besides his old Detroit documentary that got the game-show host fired. Guess I coulda just link-jacked him instead of doing my own reading on the subject. Woulda saved me some time.  &gt;the politically correct assholes who are ruining this world  Yes, I would much rather lump entire races together based on my limited anecdotal evidence, label them as all coming from one country of origin even though many of them aren't from that country and actually have a huge hate or rivalry for that country, and then make sweeping generalizations about my newly formed version of their ""culture"" that consist of completely made up and unsupported stereotypes I arbitrarily assign to them. Those damn respectful people ruining the world.  &gt;people are different. races are different. cultures are different.  Yup, they are. That's why I actually try to know something about the people, the races, and the cultures instead of doing something foolish like lumping them all together with a racist statement like implying that an entire race is simply more violent than another entire race. It's almost like a statement like that completely violates the statement that I've now quoted. It's like you're making this shit up as you go.  &gt;you shouldn't be labeled a racist by liberal political correct assholes who use racism as an argument to divert focus from the point  You should be labeled a racist when you stereotype an entire race based on your anecdotal evidence. You've been exposed to what, 100,000 individual Hispanics in the US? You can remember, assuming your memory is world-class, 1,000 of them? There were [44 million Hispanics in the US alone in 2006.](http://www.census.gov/population/www/socdemo/hispanic/hispanic_pop_presentation.html) So you've been exposed to 0.2% of them, and you can actually remember 0.002% of them. That's what you're using to make your assessment of their culture as a whole. I'm originally from a county of approximately 50,000 people. Using your approach, you would get to describe the culture of my entire county based on meeting 1 individual from that county. That would be really stupid. Racism is stupid, and you're a perfect example of why.  &gt;guess who owns those companies?? we do!! the shareholders.  I love this argument. This is the concept that runs the US. By allowing a corporation to be publicly traded and stock to be available to buy, we will actually *want* that company to terribly overcharge for their products! We get profit on our investment that way!  The reality is that the average shareholder will receive almost nothing in return for their investment and will actually spend money on the overpriced products in the meantime, thus negating any money they would have made. The rich get richer and the poor stay poor, but hey, if we can keep the American Dream^® alive, the whole system will surely benefit me even though it didn't work for those other folks.",®

This was especially apparent in the [N64](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_64#Programming_difficulties) which 3rd parties thought was complete ass.  As far as graphics/hardware goes (and network multiplayer), Nintendo has always been behind the times as well.   Genesis beat the shit out of the NES.   Game Gear beat the shit out of the Game Boy.   Playstations versus SNES is a joke.   N64 was a stillbirth hardware wise.   Gamecube was another stillbirth.    I also think they like it this way, less work for them.  Nintendo gaming systems have been and will always be conduits for the intellectual property **they** own/licence, and games **they** develop. Everything else is cake.  They can slide on the sales they have made and are making and any new Pokemon/Mario/Zelda/Metroid/etc games they will make, and can do this for at least two years. Then all they have to do is grab a chip from Samsung (or maybe that new netbook platform ION from nvidia) that's off the self and build a custom system around that. Improving all the while the motion sensing tech.  Then all they need to do is capture the Next Big Thing© like they did with Pokemon. (As an aside they still have plenty of other IP thet they haven't really touched yet and could make games for, like Earthbound, Icarus, Geist, Fire Emblem, Star Fox, or even F-Zero.  I personally think Nintendo has never lost a console war, especially looking back on it now. People seem to love NES/SNES/N64 titles more then any other system (with a few outliers like Sonic or Final Fantasy).  But I also think that the N64 controller was one of the best ever made.",©

t5_2qmjp,michaelochurch,1294158336,"&gt; As for competitive play, that's a tough one. It is really hard to have a free-for-all game be truly good for competitive play, though possible (e.g. Poker).  Yes. Poker is person-against-crowd. Bridge is team-against-team. Chess and Go are head-to-head. Ambition is in a weird spot, being a 4-player each-for-himself game where a weak player can make it a *lot* more volatile. Good players realize that Nil is a weak strategy (it's for making low hands playable, but it only gives a mediocre round and it enables Slam) tend to go for it about 15% of the time whereas weak players are closer to 30-35%. Table position matters more in Ambition than in other trick games, and being at right of a ""Nil-aholic"" sucks; he never leads and so you're never in 4th position.   Tournament Ambition is much more person-against-crowd, because the tables are randomly assigned and table compositions and seating positions change each round. (This is done in a way so that no player is more than one round short of any player.) You're unlikely to play at the exact same table twice and, if there is a weak player, you're not at his left (or right) every hand.   Poker has a *severe* collusion problem in cash games. In the bad old days, people were killed over it, and it's still illegal (I believe) in California to play at a cash game with a sibling or spouse. This is a lot less pronounced in tournaments, where people are focused on individually winning and it's impossible to transfer chips. Also, two people who might want to collude are unlikely to end up at the same table.   For collusion in Ambition, it hasn't been a problem in the 6- to 9-person beer-and-pizza tournaments I've hosted. If the game develops an ""official"" tournament culture, there will be a need to discuss what is appropriate table talk and what's not. Although it would be a *great* problem to have, I don't look forward to having to make those decisions, since they could make the game stuffy. For example, in some Bridge tournaments, you're not allowed to talk during games *at all*. (You use cards or voice-boxes in bidding, to prevent tone-of-voice information from breaking through.)  I did fuck up once with regard to collusion. I was playing with my girlfriend and teaching 2 new players. Because they were new, and because I'd rather a close game than a trouncing, I was giving them strategic pointers as we played. One dropped the K♣ (17-point whopper) on my girlfriend to ""punish"" her with a 30+ point trick. I told her not to do this; that ""pwning"" people in this was was bad strategy. It ruined my girlfriend's Slam and it took her months to forgive me for that. I don't blame her; I was just trying to give advice but it was a shitty time to do it. I really should have let her Slam and then told the newbie why it happened after the fact.   For the record, I prefer to teach 4 new players (and sit out) over playing with 2 or 3 newbies, but I take what I can get. One new player at the table is fine, but at 2 or 3, I either trounce them (which is no fun) or I get frustrated by the volatility that their ineptitude puts into the game. Watching 4 brand-new players is fun, though. Early in the game's evolution, that made me aware of some strategies I'd never seen before.",♣

Komen for the Cure® and our effort to protect our trademarks tell only part of the story. Komen for the Cure sees protecting its trademarks, e.g., “for the Cure” as responsible stewardship of the trust and dollars that our donors invest in us.     We’ve never put “mom and pop” charities out of business and don’t intend to. Instead, we seek solutions to keep these charities working while ensuring that donors know where their dollars are actually going. Often, this involves asking other charities to continue planning their event or promotion, but to consider clarifying the name of that event or promotion at a later date.     We do this because we believe strongly that our donors should have confidence that when they see “for the Cure,” it means their dollars are being used to support the research, community outreach and advocacy programs that Komen has funded since we began in 1982. This includes the grants that paid for 600,000 screenings for low-income or uninsured women last year, the 90,000 follow-up screenings, and social and financial support to 100,000 women last year.     It's clear that Komen’s work has made a difference for women and men with breast cancer. Mortality rates from breast cancer are down 31 percent in 20 years; five-year survival rates from early stage cancers are 98 percent versus 74 percent when we started, and women are benefitting from more personalized treatments for this disease.  Eighty-four cents of every dollar we raise goes to all of these programs, earning us Charity Navigator’s highest ranking four years in a row. As a result, people trust us. That’s why we protect our name.  For those envisioning legions of attorneys storming small charities to enforce trademarks, know that we monitor Patent and Trademark Office filings and reach out to the charities involved. The amount we spend to protect our donors’ interests is far below the $1 million mentioned in one news story.     We’re grateful for our millions of supporters and hope that potential donors will take the opportunity to become familiar with Komen and understand that our funding practices and strong stewardship are efforts to protect the trust they have in Susan G. Komen for the Cure.",®

Advertising photos and illustrations are also devoid of grins, except occasionally on females. Prohibition and the depression were, apparently, Serious Business.  Then the photos from the late 40s come along, and things change. Once we're into the 50s, everyone is grinning. In advertising, too, smiles abound on everyone.  Now this might be too simple of a thesis, but the spread of smiles in pictures is simply no more than a product of post war American prosperity.

t5_6,SocialCon,1294330385,"Sarah Palin deserves an apology. When she said that the new healthcare law would lead to “death panels” deciding who gets life-saving treatment and who does not, she was roundly denounced and ridiculed.  Now we learn, courtesy of one of the ridiculers — The New York Times — that she was right. Under a new policy not included in the law for fear the administration’s real end-of-life game would be exposed, a rule issued by the recess-appointed Dr. Donald M. Berwick, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, calls for the government to pay doctors to advise patients on options for ending their lives. These could include directives to forgo aggressive treatment that could extend their lives.  This rule will inevitably lead to bureaucrats deciding who is “fit” to live and who is not. The effect this might have on public opinion, which by a solid majority opposes Obamacare, is clear from an email obtained by the Times.  It is from Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.), who sent it to people working with him on the issue. Oregon and Washington are the only states with assisted-suicide laws, a preview of what is to come at the federal level if this new regulation is allowed to stand.  Blumenauer wrote in his November email: “While we are very happy with the result, we won’t be shouting it from the rooftops because we aren’t out of the woods yet. This regulation could be modified or reversed, especially if Republican leaders try to use this small provision to perpetuate the ‘death panel’ myth.”  Ah, but it’s not a myth, and that’s where Palin nailed it. All inhumanities begin with small steps; otherwise the public might rebel against a policy that went straight to the “final solution.” All human life was once regarded as having value, because even government saw it as “endowed by our Creator.” This doctrine separates us from plants, microorganisms and animals.  Doctors once swore an oath, which reads in part: “I will not give a lethal drug to anyone if I am asked, nor will I advise such a plan; and similarly I will not give a woman a pessary to cause an abortion.” Did Dr. Berwick, a fan of rationed care and the British National Health Service, ever take that oath? If he did, it appears he no longer believes it.  Do you see where this leads? First the prohibition against abortion is removed and “doctors” now perform them. Then the assault on the infirm and elderly begins. Once the definition of human life changes, all human lives become potentially expendable if they don’t measure up to constantly “evolving” government standards.  It will all be dressed up with the best possible motives behind it and sold to the public as the ultimate benefit. The killings, uh, terminations, will take place out of sight so as not to disturb the masses who might have a few embers of a past morality still burning in their souls. People will sign documents testifying to their desire to die, and the government will see it as a means of “reducing the surplus population,” to quote Charles Dickens.  When life is seen as having ultimate value, individuals and their doctors can make decisions about treatment that are in the best interests of patients. But when government is looking to cut costs as the highest good and offers to pay doctors to tell patients during their annual visits that they can choose to end their lives rather than continue treatment, that is more than the proverbial camel’s nose under the tent. That is the next step on the way to physician-assisted suicide and, if not stopped, government-mandated euthanasia.  It can’t happen here? Based on what standard? Yes it can happen in America, and it will if the new Republican class in Congress doesn’t stop it.  [Cal Thomas is America’s most widely syndicated op-ed columnist, appearing in more than 600 national newspapers.

t5_2qh9a,Norseman2,1294410643,"Well, the first 'myth' is just flat out wrong. Let's take a look at [the Communist Manifesto](http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Manifesto_of_the_Communist_Party/Chapter_II).   &gt;In what relation do the Communists stand to the proletarians as a whole? The Communists **do not** form a separate party opposed to the other working-class parties.  &gt;They have **no interests** separate and apart from those of the proletariat as a whole.  &gt;They **do not** set up any sectarian principles of their own, by which to shape and mold the proletarian movement.  &gt;The Communists are distinguished from the other working-class parties **by this only**:  &gt;(1) In the national struggles of the proletarians of the different countries, they point out and bring to the front the common interests of **the entire proletariat, independently of all nationality**.  &gt;(2) In the various stages of development which the struggle of the working class against the bourgeoisie has to pass through, they always and everywhere represent **the interests of the movement as a whole.**  So, they formed a separate party, it is opposed to all working-class parties, the majority of its interests are separate from the proletarians, they have no shortage of sectarian principles, they do not represent the proletariat regardless of nationality, and they don't represent the interests of the movement as a whole. So far, we've got 0/6.  &gt;The immediate aim of the Communists is the same as that of all other proletarian parties: Formation of the proletariat into a class, overthrow of the bourgeois supremacy, conquest of political power by the proletariat.  Bourgeois supremacy has returned, and political power is most definitely not held by the proletariat. We're up to 0/8.  &gt;The distinguishing feature of communism is not the abolition of property generally, but the **abolition of bourgeois property**. But modern bourgeois private property is the final and most complete expression of the system of producing and appropriating products that is based on class antagonisms, on the exploitation of the many by the few.  &gt;In this sense, the theory of the Communists may be summed up in the single sentence: **Abolition of private property.**  Property here is probably better understood as capital. For example, apartments, factories, slaves, stock owned in corporations, loans, and so forth. This kind of property allows you to get money from other people simply because you have money (or property). You don't give them any work in exchange, you just take their work and let them use your money or property for a while. If you buy some stock, you get dividends (the company's profit is divided up, and distributed to the shareholders). You don't need to do any work - you just get money because you let people use your money.   This is what communists want to get rid of. Communists would want a company's profits to be divided among the workers. They would want people to stop paying rent and interest. China most definitely still has this kind of property. We're at 0/9 now, and this is the most crucial part of the definition, as the Communist Manifesto itself makes clear.  &gt;The Communists are further reproached with desiring to **abolish countries and nationality.**  We're up to 0/10.  &gt;We have seen above that the first step in the revolution by the working class is to **raise the proletariat to the position of ruling class** to **win the battle of democracy.**  The proletariat is not in charge, and there's no democracy. We're at 0/12.  &gt;Of course, in the beginning, this cannot be effected except by means of despotic inroads on the rights of property, and on the conditions of bourgeois production; by means of measures, therefore, which appear economically insufficient and untenable, but which, in the course of the movement, outstrip themselves, necessitate further inroads upon the old social order, and are unavoidable as a means of entirely revolutionizing the mode of production.  &gt;Nevertheless, in most advanced countries, the following will be pretty generally applicable.  &gt;1. Abolition of property in land and application of all rents of land to public purposes . &gt;2. A heavy progressive or graduated income tax.  &gt;3. Abolition of all rights of inheritance.  &gt;4. Confiscation of the property of all emigrants and rebels.  &gt;5. Centralization of credit in the banks of the state, by means of a national bank with state capital and an exclusive monopoly.  &gt;6. Centralization of the means of communication and transport in the hands of the state.  &gt;7. Extension of factories and instruments of production owned by the state; the bringing into cultivation of waste lands, and the improvement of the soil generally in accordance with a common plan.  &gt;8. Equal obligation of all to work. Establishment of industrial armies, especially for agriculture.  &gt;9. Combination of agriculture with manufacturing industries; gradual abolition of all the distinction between town and country by a more equable distribution of the populace over the country.  &gt;10. Free education for all children in public schools. Abolition of children's factory labor in its present form. Combination of education with industrial production, etc.  The Communist Manifesto was very clear that these policies are despotic, and they are not supposed to be used indefinitely. They are supposed to be used to get rid of capitalism, after which, they would become unnecessary.  So, let's go through them:  1. Abolition of private property: ☐ 2. Progressive income tax: ☑ 3. Abolition of inheritance rights: ☐ 4. Confiscation of the property of emigrants and rebels: ☑ 5. Exclusive nationalized banks: ☑ 6. Centralization of transport and communication: ☑ 7. Extension of state-run factories: ☑ 7. Improvement of waste land and soil development: ☐ 8. Everyone must work, establish industrial armies. ☑ 9. Agriculture and manufacturing combination, city and countryside merger: ☐ 10. Free education in public schools: ☐  Even so, while that looks like 6/11 (I counted 7 twice, for separate issues) none of these met the overarching requirement - that these policies should be used to get rid of capitalism, and should make themselves obsolete. Because of that failure to make these obsolete, and because it was not a democracy controlled by the proletariat that undertook these actions, we can't count any of it. The United States, for example, has a progressive income tax and free public education, but is definitely not communist.  Bring that back to our total and it's 6/23 for semi-communistic-things, and 0/23 for actually being Communist. Even, if it passed that test, it's still missing the most crucial part - the abolition of capitalism.",☑

Each spermatozoon can fuse with a larger female gamete or ovum, in the process of fertilization. A male cannot reproduce sexually without access to at least one ovum from a female.  &gt;**Homosexuality** is romantic and/or sexual attraction or behavior among members of the same sex or gender. As a sexual orientation, homosexuality refers to ""an enduring pattern of or disposition to experience sexual, affectional, or romantic attractions"" primarily or exclusively to people of the same sex.  &gt;OP is a male, dating another (feminine) male.

t5_2s92h,Fegenbo,1294461932,"Best Served Cold - Joe Abercrombie  From Publishers Weekly Starred Review. Abercrombie returns to the blood-drenched arena of the First Law trilogy (The Blade Itself, etc.) with this skillfully crafted and bleakly humorous sword and sorcery adventure. Duke Orso imagines that he can become king by ending the civil wars that have devastated Styria, but he errs by trying to kill his overly popular general, mercenary Monza Murcatto. Recovering from her massive injuries and mourning her murdered brother, Monza vows vengeance on Orso and half a dozen of his accomplices. Employing her own motley crew of death dealers, Monza gets her revenge, but it's neither simple nor satisfying; each target requires fresh strategy, and each death has unexpected effects. Abercrombie is both fiendishly inventive and solidly convincing, especially when sprinkling his appallingly vivid combat scenes with humor so dark that it's almost ultraviolet. (Aug.)

t5_2qh1i,casperrosewater,1294876870,"[The Sociopath Next Door](http://www.amazon.com/Sociopath-Next-Door-Martha-Stout/dp/0767915828/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1294876746&amp;sr=1-1)  From Publishers Weekly [Dr.] Stout says that as many as 4% of the population are conscienceless sociopaths who have no empathy or affectionate feelings for humans or animals. As Stout (The Myth of Sanity) explains, a sociopath is defined as someone who displays at least three of seven distinguishing characteristics, such as deceitfulness, impulsivity and a lack of remorse. Such people often have a superficial charm, which they exercise ruthlessly in order to get what they want. Stout argues that the development of sociopathy is due half to genetics and half to nongenetic influences that have not been clearly identified. The author offers three examples of such people, including Skip, the handsome, brilliant, superrich boy who enjoyed stabbing bullfrogs near his family's summer home, and Doreen, who lied about her credentials to get work at a psychiatric institute, manipulated her colleagues and, most cruelly, a patient. Dramatic as these tales are, they are composites, and while Stout is a good writer and her exploration of sociopaths can be arresting, this book occasionally appeals to readers' paranoia, as the book's title and its guidelines for dealing with sociopaths indicate.

You'll ask her if she is sure that she's outside and she will remember why you guys broke up in the first place, second guess why she's letting you come over at all, get mad, and hang up. Then you'll spend the next half hour trying to find your car, and finally drive off only to end up with several hours that you can't account for, with a vague memory of trying to steal a bottle of vodka from a closed restaurant you wandered into. During those few hazy hours you'll either spend or lose your money (who knows!?) somewhere and stumble into a gas station where you'll try and convince the attendant that its ok for you to take a pack of cigarettes and a Rockstar® without paying for them. He won't see it it the same way, but you'll try and take the stuff anyway. When you run out with the smokes, he will chase you into the parking lot and stand behind your car to keep you from leaving, but you will decide that you've still got this, drive through the grass *around* the gas station and pull a u-turn across a 4 lane thoroughfare, over a median, and then get arrested a few minutes later. I don't recommend it.  For the record though, dxm is a dissociative anesthetic, and as such it did wonders for my staying power on a number of occasions. I really really don't recommend using it outside of its suggested dosage, as it can be neurotoxic. Using it even in the 100mg range with any regularity could have negative effects on your cognition. I can vouch for higher doses having permanent negative effects. However, if you're dead set on trying this I would recommend experimenting in the 90-180mg range, but not going over 240mg, or you may start experiencing psychedelic effects. Good luck to you.",®

Your exceptionalist delusions, coupled with a blatant ignorance of how the world works, only to top it off by feeling you actually know something.  &gt; I don't want switch from politics to economics  Uhm, we're talking politics about economy here? And the way government intervention is supposedly going to affect the way your corporations do business? WTH?  &gt; I will just say that an ant is much more productive than a tiger, but who lives the freer life?  Pretty analogy; excepting that contrary to what your government-mandated indoctrination might have led you to believe, in those countries I'm talking about, and as per the definition of GPD per hour worked, people there are ""freer"" because they work less and have far superior acquisitive powers. They're also happier BTW, and live higher quality lives by any conceivable indicator and poll available. Sorry to bust your Freedom Bubble®  &gt; I would guess China would have the highest.  Are you joking, high, or just so plainly proud of your ignorance that you can't even be bothered to google it? China's population is pretty poor.  &gt; I grant it is a fine point, but these laws were enacted to protect free enterprise.  Thanks for the history lesson, but I'm not seeing anywhere the explanation as to what exactly makes those laws good (or even good back then and bad now), or how impeding huge mergers like in OP would be any significantly different. How exactly do you draw that line? Or do you just wait for Glenn Beck to tell you that? Give me some sort of logical reasoning here, because you're not making any sense.  &gt; I don't live in a Socialist country. I have a government that wants us to become socialist. It is not the first time it has been tried and it is not the last time it will fail  Now you just sound like a prophecy/conspiracy theorist. Good will trump evil in the end!  &gt; In reference to the above discussion, we allow countries like China, which have no anti-trust laws, to produce knock-off good at uber cheap prices and undercut our own businesses  If you're talking about Chine because you think that's what I meant, stop embarrassing yourself. Otherwise, ""you **allow** whomever to do whatever""? WTH do you seriously think you should have the authority to make those sorts of calls? (thankfully you don't BTW, because the real world doesn't work that way)  &gt; Sort of liberal? Isn't that like sort of pregnant?  Yes, precisely, because the political **spectrum** can be perfectly reduced to a binary value. Jeez, no wonder you're trapped in an inescapable 2-party system over there.  &gt; Actually I am completely comfortable with my views (didn't think I would know that one, did you?)  You don't seem comfortable in the sense that you continue going back and forth having completely opposite opinions on pretty similar matters without any apparent rationale behind any of it. Also, if you think cognitive dissonance is a big word... Well let's just leave it at that.   &gt; Laying aside the DSM for a moment  Who the hell brought the DSM into any of this? Oh, I see. Since you went through my comment history you realised I'm into psych, and since you've been trained to make the associations psychiatrist &gt; DSM &gt; fancy words &gt; evil, you figured ""cognitive dissonance"" was a fancy psychiatric term. Sorry to disappoint you, but no.  &gt; Prohibiting a business from doing something because it might not be in the interest of the public- bad for the free enterprise economy. Let the consumer decide. Prohibiting a business from taking an unfair advantage that would impede other businesses from competing- good for the free enterprise economy. It allows the consumer to make decisions.  Ah. Here's the much sought-after rationale. Too bad it's such bullshit, that I actually think this merger would fall under your second condition, while any decent rhetorician could argument that your railroad example fell under the first. Try again, with more concrete terms.  I do find it terribly amusing, though, how you feel the need to qualify everything with ""good"" and ""bad"" tags. Very telling indeed.  &gt; LOL. You residents, especially psychiatric residents (or whatever they are called in your country), kill me  From the sound of it, I seriously doubt you actually know any residents IRL, let alone psychiatry ones. Not that it matters at all, but then again what I do for a living shouldn't either.  &gt; I love your mentally challenging approach to argument (I use the same one), your midstream narcissism always makes you shoot yourself in the foot.  Would this ""mentally challenging approach"" you speak of be ""rational debate"", by any chance? I certainly disagree that ""you use the same one"". I don't know what you mean by narcissism, but I've yet to be shown (by you, I mean, it would certainly be narcissistic to claim I've never been successfully corrected) where I've ""shot myself in the foot"".  Let's shift the focus of this discussion to a more concrete area, shall we? Please tell me, with succinct explanations and real-world examples, why you think a purely capitalist approach (that's the term you've been looking all this time, that you've been mistaking for ""freedom"") is better than government regulation of corporations. Or if you prefer, why you think Norway or the Netherlands (actually almost all of Europe in general) are on such a path of self-destruction with their socialist tendencies.

Two recipes for you: [Creamy Chicken Tortilla Soup](http://www.ro-tel.com/recipe.jsp?action=recipe&amp;recipeid=3321&amp;view=view) - I make this with an extra can of beans added in (usually pintos) and a full can of corn instead of the 1/2 can it calls for. You could substitute Ro*Tel® Mild for the regular Ro*Tel® if you have little ones that don't want it spicy. You can also toss in a cup or two of leftover cooked rice if you have it, it's tasty and will stretch a couple more meals out of it. Or serve it over cooked rice. Either way is great. :)   **Kalua Pig**  * 3 lbs of boneless (or bone-in) pork shoulder * 1 tablespoon salt (use a good salt like Hawaiian sea salt) * 1-2 teaspoons Liquid Smoke * 1 small head of cabbage  Rub salt on the outside of the pork and put into crock pot. Drizzle liquid smoke over top. If the pork is very lean add 1/2 cup of water (most shoulder has plenty of fat in it so you wouldn't need it). When you get home from work, cut up the cabbage into medium chunks and toss it in on top of the pork. Cook for another 30-45 minutes and it's done! Serve over rice with a side of macaroni salad for the 'authentic' Hawaiian plate dinner. (P.S. a lot of recipes on the 'net say this needs *sixteen hours* of cooking but I always do mine 8-9 hours on low and it's fine).",®

t5_2qh2p,taqwa,1295332128,"&gt; You need to offer a better definition of ethical behavior, to start with.  therefore upvoted! The question of what would be universally acceptable as a definition (not likely everyone will agree on any rule book) for ethical behavior is something I and many of the respondents above have tried to skip.   If we just assume there's SOME standard of ethics for that rational being -- we don't need to know what it is -- we can still question what his motivations could be for choosing the ""ethical"" choice, even without knowing what that would be.  &gt;A purely rational being would say, ""In [a sufficient amount of] time, I will be dead and everything I might have acquired will no longer be meaningful to me. Therefore, there is no purpose in action, and no purpose in inaction, since all actions are rendered impotent by death.""  Given a longer time frame, this is everyone's situation, but I HOPE we can still be rational and go about living even though we'll die someday.   As for the purpose in action, lets just say he gets to eat that one last candy bar before he dies.  (He **LOVES** candy bars).  &gt; In fact, if we strip everything away to the barest minimum, I think we find that ethical and unethical actions are equal in terms of rational merit, since everything can be reduced to arbitrariness.  I don't think that line of thought will lead to any productive discussion.

Both expoxy and cyanoacrylates are structural adhesives, but epoxy and cyanoacrylates are not the same thing.

Ideally you want to have your unit production buildings always making another unit within seconds of it finishing, but if you're doing something micro intensive and your money creeps up, throw down some more Gateways.  It's better to have 10 Gateways and warping in 9 units per wave than 8 Gateways and warping in 8 units per wave with additional money you can't spend.  Also, more Pylons.  With 2 bases, with 8 Gateways, you can warp in 16 food worth of units every 45-ish game-time seconds, excluding tech production.  Definitely don't want to get supply blocked as you build up your army towards 200.  Also planting Pylons around the map is a good idea.  Having additional warp-in points is a good idea, but more importantly, Pylons are like Creep Tumors in that you can track enemy movement much better when you have vision damn near everywhere.  Drop Pylons at the mineral lines so you can keep tabs of when your opponent is trying to expand there.  Knowing when they expansion and to where is pretty vital information to have.  Also - Charge.  I ♥ Charge and so should you.  If you're in midgame with money hanging out and you don't have Charge, you might consider getting it!  Because then your Zealots will be so much more awesome.

Fry it till it tastes the way you want it. Aaand you're done. Almost. Any other ingredients should be prepared separately, and added to the rice at the last minute. If you continue to cook the rice, with moist ingredients in it(ie: meats, veggies) it will return to mush, because at that point, your making risotto, which is good, but not what we're aiming for.

t5_2qh6c,rocker895,1295935010,"&gt;  On the other hand, it's silly to think I can point to the day I prayed the Sinner's Prayer that made me Saved so now He owes me... as if I could coerce God :-\  Yeah, because it's not like God ever makes a [verbal covenant with anyone, right?](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2012:1-3&amp;version=NIV)  (I can provide more if you like, this is just the first of many that springs to mind.)  Actually, maybe you could enlighten us by showing us someone who did make a covenant with God, but *no words were spoken*?  As far as 'coercing God' goes, or thinking He 'owes you', if that's really the mindset someone is operating from, then they really *should* be questioning their salvation.    If, on the other hand, they know they are 'pretty messed up', as you say, perhaps they can take comfort when God says:  2 Timothy 2:12-13 (New International Version, ©2010)   12 if we endure,     we will also reign with him.  If we disown him,     he will also disown us;  13 if we are faithless,     he remains faithful,     for he cannot disown himself.  Or:  Romans 8:31-39 (New International Version, ©2010)   31 What, then, shall we say in response to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us? 32 He who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all—how will he not also, along with him, graciously give us all things? 33 Who will bring any charge against those whom God has chosen? It is God who justifies. 34 Who then is the one who condemns? No one. Christ Jesus who died—more than that, who was raised to life—is at the right hand of God and is also interceding for us. 35 Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall trouble or hardship or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword? 36 As it is written:    “For your sake we face death all day long;     we are considered as sheep to be slaughtered.”[a]   37 No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us. 38 For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons,[b] neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, 39 neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.  tl;dr:  God is faithful, even though we suck.  Really, Silouan, I would expect more from a moderator, than a theological drive-by shooting at other Christians.   ",©

t5_2r9vp,highguy420,1295995383,"The lack of cannabinoids does not ""CAUSE"" the diseases, but it doesn't treat or prevent them either.  So, since we evolved in a world where cannabis was so important we have evolved to expect it to be there.  If you take MDMA too frequently you can reduce your body's production of dopamine and seratonin.  In the same way we have evolved for the last few thousands of years to expect cannabinoids to be present in our food and medicine.  Now that it has been removed, our brains expect it to be provided by the environment and, therefore produce very little of it.  If you stopped taking acetaminophen after taking it every single day for the last year and you started getting headaches again, the lack of Tylenol® in your system didn't ""CAUSE"" the headache, it was already there, just masked.    In the same way, our lack of cannabinoids in our environment doesn't ""CAUSE"" cancer, but it does stop preventing and treating it.  So, try to think it through when you throw down the ""causation =/= correlation"" bullshit.  You actually have to take a second and think ""is this guy trying to link the two in a causal manner or is he just mentioning that the two are related?"".  Because you got it wrong this time.  Thanks for playing though, try again next time.  Also, if you do the research, as I have, you will see that the correlation isn't that great.  We have increased the number of dangerous substances and chemicals we are exposed to every day at a much greater rate than the presence of cannabinoids has decreased.  There is a trend that is shown to be in the same direction, but we would have to increase our consumption of cannabinoids at a much greater rate to combat the environmental presence of carcinogens and other sources of cancer.  The outlawing of hemp production also was very soft at first and it took years for the nation to even realize that hemp had been outlawed and that they needed tax stamps to produce it.  It took years for them to start cracking down on hemp, and decades before they started cracking down on recreational use of cannabis.  Many products used hemp and many food products used hemp seeds, and these products continued to use them imported from Mexico, Canada and every single other industrialized nation in the entire world because we were the only retarded enough to outlaw the most useful plant on earth.  Over time we have removed hemp from our raw materials as we replaced them with synthetics.  We don't have a hard cutoff date when the environmental presence of cannabinoids dropped since it is happening slowly over time.  The main point here is that we fucked up by outlawing it.  If it had not been outlawed we would have been treating and preventing cancer with it accidentally all along the way with unrelated medicines (for tooth aches, menstrual cramps, sore muscles, anxiety, etc.) and we would have known by at least 1973, if not earlier, that it was effective at treating cancerous tumor growth and could have started using it for that purpose.  The lack of cannabis in our environment is not the cause of the cancer and other diseases, but it is a factor of the high cancer and other disease rates.  If it had not been outlawed we would have less medical issues today.  If you debate that fact then you need to do some more research.",®

If you understand that division is simply a ratio, and percents are ratios and you can use language to describe the problem then you can come up with the correct formula EVEN IF YOU HAVE NEVER BEEN TAUGHT IT.   If you just memorize the rules and formulas then you don't actually gain any insight into how math works, just how to work math problems.  If you haven't learned that specific formula you are fucked.  So, just because you were taught math that way and you liked it does not mean it is a good way to learn math.  You are teaching the Wal*Mart® method for math.  If you codify the procedure so that any idiot can do it then you can hire any idiot to do the job.    What the OP asked for, and you failed to provide, is a compelling method for learning math.  They already have a job at Wal*Mart®, they want a job that they actually enjoy.  They want to understand and enjoy math, not learn some list of rules.  You can defend your method, but it is shit.  It is ineffective and alienates most people subjected to it.

So, to learn math learn something that needs math.  Don't just try to gorge yourself on mathematical concepts until you regurgitate up the right formula.

Not only does the research provide important insight into health-related problems linked to individuals with disrupted clocks - such as pilots and shift workers - it also indicates that the 24-hour circadian clock found in human cells is the same as that found in algae and dates back millions of years to early life on Earth.  Two new studies out tomorrow, 27 January, in the journal Nature from the Universities of Cambridge and Edinburgh give insight into the circadian clock which controls patterns of daily and seasonal activity, from sleep cycles to butterfly migrations.  One study, from the Institute of Metabolic Science at the University of Cambridge, has for the first time identified 24-hour rhythms in red blood cells. This is significant because circadian rhythms have always been assumed to be linked to DNA and gene activity, but - unlike most of the other cells in the body - red blood cells do not have DNA.  Akhilesh Reddy, from the University of Cambridge and lead author of the study, said: ""We know that clocks exist in all our cells; they're hard-wired into the cell. Imagine what we'd be like without a clock to guide us through our days. The cell would be in the same position if it didn't have a clock to coordinate its daily activities.  ""The implications of this for health are manifold. We already know that disrupted clocks - for example, caused by shift-work and jet-lag - are associated with metabolic disorders such as diabetes, mental health problems and even cancer. By furthering our knowledge of how the 24-hour clock in cells works, we hope that the links to these disorders - and others - will be made clearer. This will, in the longer term, lead to new therapies that we couldn't even have thought about a couple of years ago.""  For the study, the scientists, funded by the Wellcome Trust, incubated purified red blood cells from healthy volunteers in the dark and at body temperature, and sampled them at regular intervals for several days. They then examined the levels of biochemical markers - proteins called peroxiredoxins - that are produced in high levels in blood and found that they underwent a 24-hour cycle. Peroxiredoxins are found in virtually all known organisms.  A further study, by scientists working together at the Universities of Edinburgh and Cambridge, and the Observatoire Oceanologique in Banyuls, France, found a similar 24-hour cycle in marine algae, indicating that internal body clocks have always been important, even for ancient forms of life.  The researchers in this study found the rhythms by sampling the peroxiredoxins in algae at regular intervals over several days. When the algae were kept in darkness, their DNA was no longer active, but the algae kept their circadian clocks ticking without active genes. Scientists had thought that the circadian clock was driven by gene activity, but both the algae and the red blood cells kept time without it.  Andrew Millar of the University of Edinburgh's School of Biological Sciences, who led the study, said: ""This groundbreaking research shows that body clocks are ancient mechanisms that have stayed with us through a billion years of evolution. They must be far more important and sophisticated than we previously realised. More work is needed to determine how and why these clocks developed in people - and most likely all other living things on earth - and what role they play in controlling our bodies.""

But just as Spain seemed about to confront this dark chapter, Judge Garzón was forced to concede jurisdiction of the case to lower provincial courts. They are unlikely to pursue such a complex and controversial case.  Campaigners, however, refuse to give up. They are to take to court the case of Beatriz Soriano Ruiz. In 1964 she was taken from her mother while still in hospital and disappeared. Her sister, 44-year-old Mar Soriano Ruiz, says: “I hope one day to set eyes on my sister.”  http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-spain-franco-20110107,0,4809520.story Delete  Unlike Argentina, Spain has had no truth commission or trials.  In 2008, Spanish Judge Balthazar Garzon catapulted the fate of the “lost children” into the public spotlight as part of a wider investigation of human rights abuses during Franco’s 37-year dictatorship. But his efforts met with fierce resistance. Accused of violating the terms of Spain’s amnesty law, Garzon has been indicted on charges of abusing his power.  Garzon’s case has stalled, but it broke society’s unwritten pact of silence and spurred more families to come forward.  In addition to the children taken after the civil war for Franco’s brand of political cleansing, child thefts continued into the 1960s and beyond, hundreds of families say, targeting mothers who were vulnerable under the Franco regime.  The later cases also were politically tinged, but the families allege that it was crooked doctors and midwives who stole newborns from clinics, motivated by personal gain.  Blanca Guerrero is searching for her brother, Miguel Angel, who was born June 5, 1945.  Her mother, Agustina, was from a family of known Republicans but was not herself politically active. After being pressured to have her child at a Madrid clinic where she worked, she was told that her son was stillborn. But she always told her daughter that she had felt him moving. Agustina died in 2009.  The case of Guerrero’s brother is among those taken up by Mar Soriano, who is heading a campaign to trace the babies stolen in the later years of the dictatorship. Soriano is looking for her sister, Beatriz, who was born at a clinic in Madrid on Jan. 3, 1964.  “The babies were taken from poor, unprotected people,” Soriano said in a telephone interview. “It was rooted in an ‘anything goes’ culture of impunity. If you knew the right people, I believe you could just buy someone else’s newborn.”  Soriano recounted that her mother gave birth to a “chubby, beautiful and peaceful” girl. But she was discharged from the hospital without the child, who doctors claimed was ill.  Her mother continued bringing milk to the clinic until she was told that the baby had died of an ear infection. The clinic staff said, “We’ll take care of everything,” and told her that Beatriz had already been buried in a mass grave.  Soriano and fellow activists are putting pressure on Spain’s justice system. They petitioned state prosecutor Javier Zaragoza at the High Court twice last month.  But so far Zaragoza has ruled out legal action. Instead, he has suggested that the Justice Ministry set up a DNA bank.  Seekers need the authorities’ cooperation to access archives and open records that are essential to the search.  “This is not about what side you are on,” Soriano said. “Families have always lived with this terrible doubt, with this sense of loss. This is about the search for the truth.”  Healy is a special correspondent.

I wish they wouldn't install bloatware on my parents' computer all the time, but AVG seems to have a minimal impact/footprint in most cases.

The only thing it ever warns us about is OMGAWD U HAEV BAD COOKIES LOL. I haven't run an AV at home (beyond a few on demand scans - which never had any results) for like 7-years. Granted, I'm sitting behind a firewall/router, have reasonable security settings, could probably notice off behavior, and am very careful on what I download from torrent sites (i.e. user comments, trusted users, etc). I think I've actually went through like 4-5 different hardware failures and zero software related infections in the 7-years.  As you implied, AVs seem to be there for the obvious.

The lake of fire is the second death. **15 Anyone whose name was not found written in the book of life was thrown into the lake of fire.**  The damned burn in fire. Nothing you have quoted contradicts that. In fact your explanation that the ""Wages of sin are death, not hell"", contradicts the verse I quoted: Mark 9:43.   Look, I'll step through this carefully. OP says ""I burn forever for just my own sins"", you say ""the bible doesn't actually say there is a hell"", and that you just ""cease to exist"". You were the one who equated hell with a place to burn forever. To turn around and claim the place you burn forever has a different name is absurd. I have shown it is not merely ""ceasing to exist"", I've shown numerous verses where it's described as an everlasting fire. You have avoided admitting such a place exists by playing a shell game with the name of the burny place, then truncating a quote to omit a mention of the burny place. At this point I think you're simply being dishonest. OP was entirely accurate to say ""burn forever"".",©

t5_2qh1e,guysmiley00,1296344081,"&gt;Self-delusion encompasses a spectrum of behaviors. It can include things as innocuous as people thinking they are more important or intelligent than how they are viewed by others to the sort of clinically defined delusional thinking with symptoms like auditory hallucination.  Do you read your posts? All of these behaviours can quite accurately be described as ""believing untrue things"". A person suffering self-delusion may believe themselves slightly better-looking than is  objectively true, or they may believe they are Napoleon. A young man interpreting the ambiguous sounds of his disabled fiancee in a manner that suits his preconceptions falls well within that spectrum.  &gt;Unconditional acceptance is certainly not defined as taking things at face value.  Unconditional - without conditions or limitations; total.   Acceptance - belief (in) or assent (to). (Collins English Dictionary).  If that isn't what you meant by ""take at face value"", what exactly did you mean?  &gt;Potential conflict of interest. (etc.)  Oh, honey - if you're going to try to get technical, it's best to do some research first. What you've said is just gibberish. Let me help:  ""Conflict of interest: A situation in which someone who has to make a decision in an official capacity stands to profit personally from the decision."" (The American Heritage® New Dictionary of Cultural Literacy, Third Edition)  Notice that actually *taking* the decision isn't necessary. So, as a caregiver, merely being in the position of deciding whether to use her in his Idol bid is a conflict of interest, because his interest in advancing his career is in conflict with his duty to make decisions in her best interest. So, given that he is in a position that is the textbook definition of a ""conflict of interest"", and that she has suffered a severe TBI, the onus falls on him to either prove that she is legally capable of making the decision herself, or to allow an impartial party to make the decision.  &gt;I don' think you are very polite.

In some cases, the Serial-ATA (SATA) ports within the chipsets may degrade over time, potentially impacting the performance or functionality of SATA-linked devices such as hard disk drives and DVD-drives. The chipset is utilized in PCs with Intel's latest Second Generation Intel Core processors, code-named Sandy Bridge. Intel has stopped shipment of the affected support chip from its factories. Intel has corrected the design issue, and has begun manufacturing a new version of the support chip which will resolve the issue. The Sandy Bridge microprocessor is unaffected and no other products are affected by this issue.   &gt;The company expects to begin delivering the updated version of the chipset to customers in late February and expects full volume recovery in April. Intel stands behind its products and is committed to product quality. For computer makers and other Intel customers that have bought potentially affected chipsets or systems, Intel will work with its OEM partners to accept the return of the affected chipsets, and plans to support modifications or replacements needed on motherboards or systems. The systems with the affected support chips have only been shipping since January 9th and the company believes that relatively few consumers are impacted by this issue. **The only systems sold to an end customer potentially impacted are Second Generation Core i5 and Core i7 quad core based systems**. Intel believes that consumers can continue to use their systems with confidence, while working with their computer manufacturer for a permanent solution. For further information consumers should contact Intel at www.intel.com on the support page or contact their OEM manufacturer.",®
