t5_2qhad,blooit,1317492600,"I hate to be the voice of reason here, but we are a consumer-driven society, NOT a consumer-saving society.  Creditor-card holders are typically treated better than debit-card holders.  I recently applied for Chase Freedom® Visa with $250 Bonus Cash Back.  You spend $500 within the first three months and get $250.  Does this ring a bell to anybody?  At about the same time, I received coupon code to open a Chase Total Checking (TM) account for $200.  The $200 is basically interest that will be reported on Form 1099-INT.  I ended up getting both, because I read the fine print and know how to play the game.  Full disclosure:  I closed my WaMu checking account two years ago when WaMu was sold to Chase.  My median credit score is 820.  My lowest is 799.  For somebody who isn't as sophisticated, use credit cards and pay off your revolving balance at the end of the month.  You'll typically get a 30-day grace period to do so.  You'll rarely have to use your debit card or need to go to the ATM, unless you have poor credit and frequent gentlemen's clubs.  When you have an unauthorized charge, you credit card company will fight for you.  Not so with a run-of-the-mill debit card.  Last, but not least, if you carry a high credit card balance or if you have a high APR, you can generally negotiate to get your balance forgiven or rate lowered, or both.

I have the same thing you do with choking or even just when he puts his hand around my throat. I can not say no and only want to please him. Orders or commands given while in this position can not be disobeyed even after the hand is removed. However you can still initiate with out loosing your submissive role. Think about his pleasure first. Even just letting your hands wander in a kiss can give him the idea that you want him. Or if you want to be a little more forward simply telling -or begging- him to fuck you can work perfectly. Haven't tried this one yet but, coming up to him while he is sitting and initiating oral before he even gets a chance to start something.

Rinse the fish fillets and place them in a shallow glass baking dish. Drizzle olive oil over the fish and season with garlic and rosemary. Rub the seasonings into the fish. Cover and refrigerate overnight.  2. Dissolve the curing salt in the water and pour into the dish with the fish. Let it marinate for 15 minutes per half inch of thickness.  3. Meanwhile, prepare your smoker for a four hour slow burn using charcoal. The temperature should be at 150 degrees F (65 degrees C) before you get started.  4. Remove the fish from the brine and discard leftover liquid. Place each piece of fish onto a small piece of aluminum foil - just big enough to hold the fillet, and season with pepper to taste. Place them on the rack in the smoker. Sprinkle a handful of the soaked wood chips over the coals or place in a heat box. Cover and allow fish to smoke for 2 hours, adding more wood chips as needed.  5. Increase the heat in the smoker (add more charcoal) to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C) and let the fish smoke until the internal temperature of the fillets reaches 165 degrees F (72 degrees C). Remove from the smoker and let rest for 20 minutes before serving.",®

The global economy is in complete chaos. The gap between rich and poor is wider than ever, the top 1% is making a killing off the backs of all the less well off, young people are grossly indebted all because they made the choice to receive an education, the environment is suffering because of rampant capitalism... and the unheard 99% is finally so sick of being unheard that they are willing to at least try and do something about it. &gt; &gt;And yet, here we are, in prosperous Calgary where no one protests and everything is hunky dory right?

What they should do to deal with this:  1) Remove that 8 day crap on their website, hulu, and iTunes. it's not doing them any favors. 2) Send Fringe to Wednesdays and move X Factor/AI to Thursday/Friday.

t5_2qpp6,SadCritters,1317651612,"That doesn't support how a unit should get nerfed at all. . .    Are you insane?  Why do redditors always read what they -want- to read and never the actual words of what another person is saying?  That article talks about how one person using only one unit over and over and learning the ins and outs of it makes them better with that one unit, to the point that it looks insane.  But in actuality, they are weaker because of it.  IE: The first part about Bishops and how David Janowski was so obsessive over that piece that he was willing to sacrifice other pieces, including game-winning pieces, just to keep them alive.  And when they were gone, he felt as though all hope was lost.  Are you saying that they should have changed the way Bishops work?  Because clearly they aren't ""OP"".  And then in Street Fighter.   David Sirlin says that he enjoys using a character to perfect the same move over and over again.  Although it's a tactic to lock your opponent in, in a fighting game, doing the same move over and over and over won't win you the fight.  You become predictable.  The same can be said for Destiny.  He made infestors look insane.  Yes, Fungal had to be changed.  But Neural Parasite? Really? It had to drop 2 range?  There's a difference between nerfing a unit and making it useless.   I'd suggest you reread the article and see what it actually says, instead of what you THINK it says. ♥  ( PS: ""The theory is that if an opponent can’t stop a certain move, then I don’t have to bother with the sticky business of predicting what they will do next. I also don’t have to worry about them predicting what I’ll do: we all know what I’ll be doing! As long as whatever I am doing isn’t making me lose, I’m content to continue doing it and make the opponent prove that he can beat it.  I am also notoriously lacking in dexterity and “technical skill” at games. I’ve always had to make up for this with my good sense of timing (exactly when to do a move). When it comes to tournament performance, I was able to dominate the scene in a particular version of the game called Street Fighter Alpha 2. I won national tournaments, and could consistently beat any opponent in the United States, save for Valle and Choi. In other games, I have reached the upper echelons, but other players have overshadowed me.  The lesson to learn from my play style is that while it can get extremely far, obsession with a single aspect of a game just can’t go all the way. Even in my most successful showings in Alpha 2, my secret was that at the highest level of play against Valle and Choi, I had to abandon my “same move over and over” tactics in favor of using my backup characters, which I played with a much more well-rounded style. After realizing the superiority of Choi’s style, I have attempted to change my focus and “use all the buttons.”  ""  That quote from the article sums up Destiny, except in Starcraft II.  He does what he has to do to win, hoping his opponent can't counter his move. If he can't, then he wins. When his opponents catch on, he loses. He dominates on ladders and in customs but is overshadowed by other competitors.   Just because a unit seems insane in the hands of a person that has devoted all of his time to learning it, doesn't mean it's over-powered that much. ( I already agree that fungal needed changed. But Neural Parasite being nerfed so deeply, while already buffing Protoss, is a bit harder to swallow. )  Look at Seige Tanks. Grubby uses them like they are Infestors. He has a very slow, dominating mech style of play, rendering all ground attacks useless.  Should we nerf Seige Tanks too?  Or maybe we should nerf Phoenix because of the way MC made them look?  I suggest re-reading with your ""rose tinted glasses"" off, friend.  Because had you done so the first time, you'd know that the author at the end goes on to explain how it can't get you all the way by being obsessive.   A perfect example of this is Destiny's IPL showing. He got there, but his Infestor play can't beat the stronger mechanics and playstyles of other players and quickly lost.  If this were the case, in which you're saying that by using a certain style it ""proves they needed nerfed"", then I suggest we nerf the Deathball down to size; yeah? 'Since that's what almost all Protoss players use and is what wins them games? Or maybe we nerf marines to hell and back? Maybe Zerglings should be nerfed because of players like Stephano?  )  ♥ ",♥

t5_2qi6d,grunge_ryder,1317775077,"Sea Foam® is a safe and versatile additive that can be used in fuel &amp;amp; oil in 2 cycle, 4-cycle, rotary and diesel engines or added directly into the combustion chamber on 2-cycle, 4-cycle and rotary engines.  Sea Foam® is a 100% pure petroleum product, so it is as safe for seals, o-rings, sensors and other fuel system and engine components as the fuel or motor oil that runs the engine.  Sea Foam® contains NO harsh chemicals.  All three types of engines (2 &amp;amp; 4 cycle, rotary and diesel engines) suffer from the problems described below, all of which are addressed by Sea Foam®.  Old petroleum residue (gum and varnish) buildup  .  All fuels and engine oils leave behind residue deposits that accumulate over time.  In the crank case, this residue builds up around lifters and rings, preventing them from functioning properly.  In the fuel system, residue builds up in the injectors or carburetor jets, on the tops of pistons and on the backs of intake valves.  Carbon in the exhaust adheres to this residue and forms carbon deposits.  THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE RESIDUE IN YOUR CRANK CASE AND THE RESIDUE IN YOUR FUEL SYSTEM.  IT IS ALL PETROLEUM VARNISH.  Sea Foam® slowly and safely re-liquefies this varnish so contaminants and carbon deposits can be safely cleaned out of the systems as the engine is operated.  Lack of lubrication  This can occur in the fuel system as the result of dry fuel additives such as ethanol that actually remove lubrication from the engine components.  In the crank case, varnish buildup around the lifters and rings can prevent the oil from properly circulating and lubricating.  Sea Foam® contains a high-temperature penetrating, lubricating and cleaning oil that will not evaporate even in high heat areas like the combustion chamber.  It is also able to safely dissolve varnish from lifters and rings so the oil can flow and lubricate properly.  Moisture  Fuel can absorb moisture from the atmosphere - even more so with the addition of ethanol.  Crank case oil can also become easily contaminated with moisture.  Sea Foam® fully encapsulates the water molecules in the fuel and oil to prevent phase separation - rendering the absorbed moisture harmless.  By addressing these three key factors that produce premature engine wear and cause many common drivability problems, Sea Foam® can be used by professionals and do-it-yourselfers alike to safely eliminate many contamination and lubrication related performance problems and help prolong the life of an engine.  A clean, dry and well lubricated engine will run smoother and more efficiently. Not for use in Diesel Air Intake Systems.  http://www.seafoamsales.com/why-sea-foam-spray-works.html",®

You get from life the very exact thing you expect from it. By constantly reminding you of your 4everal1liness, you are creating a cognitive bias which reinforces that idea and dismisses everything in favor of the opposite. Also, you're sending out subtle (or not so subtle) signs of self-loath. People can't deal with that shit, let alone consider a social relationship with you.   Don't try too hard either. People see right through that. Don't accept just anyone as your potential friend, have standards. And when you find a potential friend, don't smother them; one free beer is enough to show them you like them, ten beers looks like an attempt at getting them unconscious.  In this lousy game of life you must act and pretend to create what you want. Act and pretend to be tony montana when walking down the street. Just imagine you're sitting on a pile of money, girls and cocaine. It's not magic so depending on your ability to act, it probably won't work right away. Just keep doing it anyway and eventually your behaviour will be based on your image of tony montana, not your self-loathing, whiney old self. I'm not saying you should be rude to people, just give them back exactly what you get from them, be it kindness or obnoxiousness. Do all the mistakes you're afraid to do. Do them many times. Nobody is keeping a tab.  After all, you've only been given this one shot at life. Why waste it on useless shit like degenerative self-consciousness? Everyone dies alone, even the social butterflies will see their friends die one by one, eventually leaving them with nothing but themselves to wither into a crack in the wall and die with.  And maybe none of what I said is related to your problem, I can't tell because I don't know you. Works for me at least... most of the time. I still have bad days when any kind of social interaction seems impossible, but now that I've learned to not give a fuck, I get over that zone pretty quickly.

That said, the 2.0T in the GTI produces more power in the Audi A4 and other VW/Audi cars, because the stock ECU is designed to produce more boost in those cars.  The engine itself is exactly the same other than the software, so it's unlikely that the added horsepower would damage it, when it's stock on an A4.

Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Toss beef cubes with flour to coat, then fry in the hot oil until browned. Place the carrots, potatoes, onion and garlic in a large slow cooker. Place the meat on top of the vegetables. Mix together the beef broth and tomato paste and pour into the slow cooker along with the beer.  2.	Cover and cook on High for 6 hours or Low for 8 hours.

No I think I 'd rather have an organic protest without a specific message, and I don't care how much that confounds and confuses the media because they are representatives of the same corporations being protested and they  are part of he problem.   The media not only will never understand the motives and try to classify it as something we've all seen before (as they're doing by classifying this as a labor movement right now), but they also somehow  think that the protestors need or want their slanted coverage when virtually the entire thing was organized without them.  I'd rather have many unfocused groups spreading 100 different messages all agreeing that things are wrong rather than 100 groups united under a labor movement spreading a labor movement message.   The latter is too much like The Tea Party®, and makes the situation entire too politically polarized from what the original intentions were.. As long as the media keeps advertising this as a leftist/socialist pro-union event then that's exactly what it's going to turn into.  &gt;Don't you think that the union members or others are sick and tired of hearing other OWS protesters not speak their exact message as well?

His perfectionism, the absolute conviction and certainty in the rightness of his opinions and – I am afraid it is true, as it is of so many leaders, Churchill and other great figures not excluded – his propensity apparently to have originated an idea that he had previously dismissed but now suddenly owned and championed, these traits must have maddened his colleagues. But the charisma, passion, delight in detail, excitement and belief in the creation of a new future – the sheer magnetic force of the man made his many faults a forgivable and almost loveable part of his mystique and greatness.  The quality I especially revered in him was his refusal to show contempt for his customers by fobbing them off with something that was “good enough”. Whether it was the packaging, the cabling, the use of screen space, the human interfaces, the colours, the flow, the feel, the graphical or textural features, everything had to be improved upon and improved upon until it was, to use the favourite phrase of the early Mac pioneers “insanely great”. It had to be so cool that you gasped. It had to feel good in the hand, look good to the eye and it had to change things. It changed things because it made users want to use the devices as they had never been used before. As I used to say of the Mac in the early days, “it makes me jump out of bed early to start work”. People may not think so but I’m as lazy as can be, and the creative, human-based implementation of technology in such a way as to encourage labour and thereby invigorate innovation and change is a remarkable achievement in so potentially dull a sector as computing.  Jobs said, when he presented the iPad to the world in 2010 that he regarded Apple as standing at the intersection of technology and the liberal arts. I pointed out that it might have been more accurate to say that Apple stood at the intersection of technology, the liberal arts and commerce. There is no doubt that as Disney’s biggest shareholder, as the boss of Pixar, the company that virtually invented computer animated cinematography, Jobs was in a unique position to bang heads together when it came to getting studio and record label bosses to consent to copyright agreements for what was to become the iTunes store, just one of the massive “game-changing” contributions he made to technology and the arts.  A control freak? Well, since “freak” is always the word used in such a context, then yes. But it was that control that won the war, freakish or not. The so-called “walled-garden” approach whereby Apple make the hardware, the software and control third party access to the APIs and architecture of each device may madden many but they are precisely what allows the devices to work so well, so cleanly, so fluently out of the box. They allow longer battery-life, less heat, more stable operating and dozens of other enormous advantages. If different companies are making the firmware, software, chips, screens, operating system, radios and cases the results will always be far less coherent and usable devices. I have nothing against Android and admire the idea of an Open Handset Alliance. I don’t want to be characterised as an incurable unthinking Apple “fanboi” – but I cannot fight the instinct that makes my hand always reach for the pocket with the iPhone in it when I have a Windows 7, a Blackberry and an Android just as available in other pockets. I have in the past set myself the task of using only an Android for two weeks, or only a Windows 7 phone or only a Blackberry and while it can be done (obviously) I am less content, more frustrated and crucially as far as I am concerned, less productive as a result. And the fact remains that it is so much easier to survive on an Android, a Windows 7 phone or a Blackberry nowadays precisely because they have all fundamentally modelled themselves on Apple criteria. They want to be smooth, graphically pleasing, they want the user to love and enjoy them. The frustratingly silly patent wars that are raging around the world between Google, Samsung, Apple and dozens of other companies would be a sad obsequy to Jobs’s colossal achievements, but with such gigantic sums of money in so huge a market at stake it is little wonder that others will do all they can to “crack” Apple. Well that is fine, I have no shares in the company. So long as the way they crack Apple is to learn from Steve Jobs that style matters, that beauty matters, that joy, simplicity, elegance, harmony, charm, wit and quality matter – well, I don’t care which company has the best stock market capitalisation.  Henry Ford didn’t invent the motor car, Rockefeller didn’t discover how to crack crude oil into petrol, Disney didn’t invent animation, the Macdonald brothers didn’t invent the hamburger, Martin Luther King didn’t invent oratory, neither Jane Austen, Tolstoy nor Flaubert invented the novel and D. W. Griffith, the Warner Brothers, Irving Thalberg and Steven Spielberg didn’t invent film-making. Steve Jobs didn’t invent computers and he didn’t invent packet switching or the mouse. But he saw that there were no limits to the power that creative combinations of technology and design could accomplish.  I once heard George Melly, on a programme about Louis Armstrong, do that dangerous thing and give his own definition of a genius. “A genius,” he said, “is someone who enters a field and works in it and when they leave it, it is different. By that token, Satchmo was a genius.” I don’t think any reasonable person could deny that Steve Jobs, by that same token, was a genius too.  I will end with a story few people know. What you probably do know is that Jobs wooed Pepsi Cola boss John Sculley to Apple in 1985. He wanted him to do to IBM the unthinkable thing that he had done to Coca Cola: beaten the brand leader into second place. He won Scully with the famous phrase, “do you want to sell fizzy sugar water for the rest of your life or do you want to change the world?” Sculley came and a few months later, astoundingly, their disagreements came to such a head that Jobs found himself fired from the company he had founded.  You probably knew that. You probably knew he went on to found his own computer company NeXt – a black cube computer that ran a UNIX operating system, revealing Jobs’s already growing conviction that the professionally popular UNIX, so suited to networking, should be the future kernel (if you’ll forgive the geeky pun) of any sensible consumer oriented operating system.  It was on a NeXt machine that the British computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee wrote the protocols, procedures and languages that added up to the World Wide Web, http, HTML, browsers, hyperlinks … in other words the way forward for the internet, the most significant computer program ever written was done on a NeXt computer. That is a feather in Steve Jobs’s cap that is not often celebrated and indeed one that he himself signally failed to know about for some time.  After having written www, Berners-Lee noticed that there was a NeXt developers conference in Paris at which Steve Jobs would be present. Tim packed up his black cube, complete with the optical disk which contained arguably the most influential and important code ever written and took a train to Paris.  It was a large and popular conference and Tim was pretty much at the end of the line of black NeXt boxes. Each developer showed Steve Jobs their new word-processor, graphic programme and utility and he slowly walked along the line, like the judge at a flower show nodding his approval or frowning his distaste. Just before he reached Tim and the world wide web at the end of row, an aide nudged Jobs and told him that they should go or he’d be in danger of missing his flight back to America. So Steve turned away and never saw the programme that Tim Berners-Lee had written which would change the world as completely as Gutenberg had in 1450. It was a meeting of the two most influential men of their time that never took place. Chatting to the newly knighted Sir Tim a few years ago he told me that he had still never actually met Steve Jobs.  Their work met however and it is through it that you are reading this. I will not be so presumptuous as to mourn the loss of Steve as a personal friend, but I will mourn his loss as a man who changed my world completely. As the great writer, wit and sage John @Hodgman (who played the pasty-faced PC in the old Apple TV commercials) wrote a few hours after Steve’s death “Everything good I have done, I have done on a Mac”.  “…and the elements  So mixed in him that Nature might stand up  And say to all the world, “this was a man!”        x Stephen  © Stephen Fry 2011",©

LEGO insists on only speaking of their product as ""LEGO bricks"" because they don't want the word to become generic, just like if you read material from the Band-Aid company, they call their products ""Band-Aid® brand adhesive strips"".  But these are legalese terms used for legal reasons — you'd sound like a corporate shill at best (and a fool at worst) if you insisted that people should say ""Band-Aid® brand adhesive strips"".  But for some reason, some LEGO people get so fixated on this branding.  I am always amazed by the small group of hardcore LEGO enthusiasts that actually get caught up trying to advance the LEGO company's futile goal of reshaping the language.  I don't blame these companies for trying, but come on — real language is much more organic and interesting than that.  Very few words maintain a constant meaning, pronunciation, or lexical category; this is one of the things that is so cool about language.",®

t5_2qhef,helveticannabis,1318183792,"I absolutely agree with this advice.   I also grew up in the church – well, half the time. My parents divorced when I was very young, after which my dad found a born-again Christian church and devoted himself to it full-time. I spent every other weekend with him: Saturdays were usually spent cleaning the fellowship hall or otherwise preparing for the next day, and all Sunday was spent in the church. At one point, when he ran into some financial trouble, we even lived in the church.   This is the chronology of my coming out story: good friends (sophomore year of high school), atheist mom and stepdad (junior year of high school), born-again Christian dad (a few months after coming out to my mom and stepdad). I was lucky in that I didn't live with my dad primarily and he was not exclusively financially supporting me. But even so, coming out to friends and select family members first really helped because I was able to almost do ""test runs"": learn potential reactions, practice answering questions that usually come up (""How long have you known?""), gain confidence, etc. By the time I came out to my dad, I had experience on my side. I think if I came out to him first, I'd be much more vulnerable and insecure, and it wouldn't have been a good experience.   **tl;dr: I agree with the above, and would suggest (if you haven't already) coming out to close friends and maybe some family members that may be more accepting.**  In any case, best of luck. Please update us on any progress you make. I admire your courage and hope everything works out in the end. ❤",❤

The LEGO company actively fights against the ""LEGOs"" pluralization because it can eventually lead to the word LEGO being untrademarkable. Sort of how like most people call them Q-Tips and Kleenex rather than cotton swab and tissue. Few more decades of that and they might *become* the words for those items, and suddenly you can't trademark it.  I hate to use another Transformer example, but Hasbro does the same thing. Transformers do not ""transform"" (at least not on according to their packaging)-- they ""convert."" Hasbro is trying to dance around the very shaky idea that you can trademark a ""real"" word like ""transformer."" It's pushing it. Of course, they own all the nonsense words like Cybertron and Megatron. And for the characters with names they can't trademark, officially on their packaging they're known as ""Autobot Ratchet"" and ""Autobot Tracks"" (jibberish mixed with real words).",®

t5_2qhx4,pbourdyk,1318343181,"Hmmmm... Got some minutes today, so let's type out some questions!   * I'm slowly developing a suspicion that I am mildly lactose intolerant (despite not being genetically predisposed to it in the slightest, pretty much every member of my family consumes a broad range of dairy products, sometimes in excess, without any adverse effects), or at the very least, my small intestine is not producing sufficient lactase.  Either way, I'd like to supplement it in small doses when I do consume excess dairy.  In my mild case, to avoid the discomfort, what dosage would you recommend and how long before/after intake should I supplement?   * The 2nd question is related to vitamin D supplementation, now that winter is looming and my hours in the sunlight are limited even further.  I'm currently taking 4-6 [Life Force® Multiple](http://www.sourcenaturals.com/products/GP1194/) (I know, should've got the men's one with no iron), as well as 1-2 Cod Liver pills daily (2500 IU vitamin A, 200 IU vitamin D).  I've read many anecdotal reports of increased energy and elevation of mood with vitamin D supplementation and I think I could benefit from it with my daily work/school stresses.  What dosage would you recommend and is [this](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002EA99HE/ref=ox_sc_act_title_2?ie=UTF8&amp;m=A4EGE1YRSP1KL) a decent deal on some D3?   * Lastly, given the above Life Force multi, could I benefit from Zinc micro addition?  My diet is clean and fairly varied, but of the common natural sources of zinc, I really only consume products from the lower half of [this table](http://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Zinc-HealthProfessional/#h3) along with beef.  In searching for zinc supplements I've found several types (gluconate, picolinate, glycinate) and it would be nice if we had a brief description of the distinction between the types, as well as, which would be more beneficial than others.

t5_6,Germainny,1318368760,"DUBLIN.- The Chester Beatty Library and Bank of America Merrill Lynch present this exciting exhibition of the art books of Henri Matisse, marking the first public display of these works in Europe. The exhibition features four of Matisse’s most artistically significant books, including the famous 'Jazz', on loan from the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Collection. On view through 25 September.  artwork: Henri Matisse - (Icarus), plate VIII of XX from the illustrated book ""Jazz"", 1947, Bank of America Merrill Lynch Collection © Succession H. MatisseBest known for his boldly coloured paintings, Matisse created a body of work that also included drawings, prints, cut-outs and sculpture, as well as costume and stage set designs. He did not begin his work with illustrated books until his late sixties, but he considered them amongst the works of which he was most proud. Matisse regarded the prints he created for these books as an extension of his drawing. The same flowing lines that characterized his oils and pencil studies carried over to the printmaking medium and related illustrations.  Two Matisse books from the Library’s own collection are also on display: Poèmes de Charles d’Orléans (1950), which is inscribed from Matisse to Sir Alfred Chester Beatty (1875-1968), and a copy of Matisse’s illustrated version of James Joyce’s Ulysses (1935), which was acquired by the Library in 2009. Beatty and Matisse knew each other and shared an interest in Persian miniatures and Japanese prints, which they both collected. Beatty visited Matisse in Nice, where they both had homes, and the inscribed book was probably given to him as a gift directly from the artist. Beatty’s wife, Edith, also knew Matisse and had two of his paintings in her personal collection.  There are a number of events organized as part of the exhibition programme, including talks, art workshops, a cooking demonstration, the Silk Worm Summer Club, films and more.  Described by the Lonely Planet as not just the best museum in Ireland, but one of the best in Europe, the Chester Beatty Library, Dublin is an art museum and library which houses the great collection of manuscripts, miniature paintings, prints, drawings, rare books and some decorative arts assembled by Sir Alfred Chester Beatty (1875-1968). The Library's exhibitions open a window on the artistic treasures of the great cultures and religions of the world. Its rich collection from countries across Asia, the Middle East, North Africa and Europe offers visitors a visual feast. Chester Beatty Library was named Irish Museum of the year in 2000 and was awarded the title European Museum of the Year in 2002.  Egyptian papyrus texts, beautifully illuminated copies of the Qur'an, the Bible, European medieval and renaissance manuscripts are among the highlights of the collection. In its diversity, the collection captures much of the richness of human creative expression from about 2700 BC to the present day. ",©

t5_2rncq,punchingsharks,1318494483,"Something relevant that I want to clear up as a Japanese(-Canadian) person: There is no such thing as ""sushi rice"". Yes, there is a type of rice which is strongly recommended if you are making (Japanese short-grain), but as I said, there is no such thing as ""sushi rice"". If you're standing in the grocery store and you see a bag of ""sushi rice"" beside a bag of short-grain, flip some tables.  To answer your question: As gregdoom stated, you must cook the rice first. After it is done, you take some rice vinegar and pour a measured amount (read the instructions) into the rice, mix it well, and let it sit for at least 10 minutes before use. I find that if you try and use it too fast, the vinegar flavour is a little overwhelming in addition to the rice not being... right. Patience. Metal bowls tend to transfer a metallic taste to the rice, so go with plastic. [The internet says vinegar actually reacts negatively to metal, which creates this taste.]  The product I personally use is [Mitsukan Rice Vinegar](http://imgur.com/bLTN1), not the Seasoned Rice Vinegar. According to the [company website](http://www.mizkan.com/Corporate/?id=392581412770), the difference between their seasoned and unseasoned rice vinegar is as follows:  &gt;Mitsukan® all natural Rice Vinegar is unsweetened with no sodium and is to be used in a variety of recipes. Mitsukan ® all natural Seasoned Rice Vinegar is lightly sweetened and lightly salted.  I'm not sure how widely this particular item is available, as I shop at the Asian supermarket in my city. I'm sure other brands will work just as well, but make sure you follow the instructions, as they can differ from bottle to bottle.   As for an FAQ, some of the ones I just found off of Google say sugar and salt should be added to the vinegar itself. I have never tried these particular methods so I can't say too much... but I can say the sushi restaurant I worked at (a highly successful hole-in-the-wall owned and operated by Japanese people) never did this. To each their own, I guess.",®

If you can't find Viuda de Sanchez, I've substituted it with a good quality Orange juice, a lime, and Pico de Gallo seasoning a good brand is Via nueva, but is won't make your drink red like Viuda de Sanchez mix will and that’s why the drink is call Vampiro (In English it translates to Vampire) because its looks red.   http://www.drinksmixer.com/drink14u9t14.html#ixzz1ag8QXFnF",®

From the book, Liquid Bread: ""Despite high levels of beer consumption in typically Mediterranean countries like Spain 4 or Italy, and despite the existence of long established breweries in certain areas, the images which are offered and reproduced in relation to such drinks are geographically typified. Good wines are assumed to be produced in Spain, France and Italy, while good beers are thought to come from central or northern Europe (Alsace, Belgium, Holland, Bavaria, Hungary, Denmark, etc.). In southern European countries, despite their own considerable and popular beer production (for beer consumption in Spain mainly hinges on local brands), the drink is sold through the evocation of a ‘Northern’ imagery. This association is exemplified by the characteristics summarised below:  Kind of beer: Pilsner, Lager, Bock, etc., all of which come from northern European regions.  Direct or indirect mention of the place of origin (if imported) or by evocation: Alsace, Denmark, Holland, etc.  Typefaces resembling those of the North: such as the traditional German Gothic ones.

The first ""girl"" proceeds to start thrusting, first leaking ejaculate, then finally ejaculating heavily on the second girl's face and neck.   She then leans back, and flips the second girl over onto her stomach, and uses her hands to spread the second girl's buttcheeks, revealing her anus. The first ""girl"" presses her penis up against the second girl's anus, leans forward, and whisper's in the second girl's ear as text appears that says ""I'm going to rape you♥"" As the first ""girl"" thrusts her penis in to the second's anus, her own anus appears to ejaculate. The second girl grimices and scratches marks into the ground. As the first ""girl"" thrusts in and out, she contines to ejaculate out of her anus. The first ""girl"" leans forward again and whispers as the text appears ""I'm going to cum!♥"" It cuts to an interior shot of the second girl's bowels, showing the penis thrusting in, then erupting in ejaculate, filling the image. It then cuts to a close up exterior shot of the penis in the anus. The seal burts and ejaculate flows out. It cuts to a waist up shot of the first ""girl"" experiencing the orgasm, and as she rubs her hands on her naked breasts they also ejaculate. It cuts to an interior shot of the second girl's body as ejaculate fills her up, after cutting to a shot of the second girl's face, the ejaculate bursts out of her mouth she seems exhasted. It cuts to another close up of the penis being removed from her anus amid a significant amount of ejaculate. It cut's to a wide view of the two girls laying on the ground, not having moved. A smile appears on the second girl's face, she rolls over, hitting the first ""girl"" and knocking her unconcious.   The scene cuts to the fist ""girl"", with arms chained above her head. As the second girl speaks, text appears saying ""My turn"". The second girl then wraps her now enormous breats around the first ""girl's"" penis, and begins using her breasts to stimulate it. As the pace increases, she forms a seal around the tip of the first ""girl's"" penis with her mouth and breasts. The seal again doesn't hold and ejaculate bursts out. The second girl has a look of satisfaction on her face. The image then cuts to the second girl standing naked, and she spreads open her vagina lips. The gif then repeats.",♥

It's not very clear, but [the blue line](http://i.imgur.com/fsaZ4.jpg) is basically just in a marine's range from the closest part of a main. Air units can move freely from the third or hide in the map's corner. [The natural](http://i.imgur.com/QTtvS.jpg) is harder to harass but the high ground blocks vision to air until they attack, so as long as you think you can safely retreat, it's possible.

I've started to switch up my home and working environments - bottles of water everywhere‼ I find them nice to look at but I don't tend to draw much *thinspiration* from pictures of my current weight or posters of my ideal weight, but little messages on post-its everywhere seem to do the trick.  I have no idea how to break the eating triggers but I plan to make myself more conscious of the thought process. I feel bad &gt; eat I hope to replace with I feel bad &gt; 20 press ups &gt; still want to eat? As I've read that others find exercise removes cravings, and also it's an extra step between the impulse and the action, so yeah, fingers crossed.  On nutrition, I love the look at some of the eating plans but I feel very overwhelmed with all the different plans one can take. I want to start losing weight my own way - less calories in, exert more effort - for now while I get used to calorie restriction and the headaches, fatigue and cravings that go with it, and also getting into the routine of training again.  I live with my partner and she can indulge all she likes and still has a near six pack (freak metabolism :)) and she is a horribly fussy eater. So while on a budget and a diet I have to plan meals to accommodate both of us (I could cook separate dishes, but that might push food costs up if things are not in bulk).  But after 10lbs my own way I'll definitely switch things up and go with an established eating plan. And I'll definitely give the Cambridge diet a good look over :) Thanks‼",‼

t5_2r05i,kalmisto,1318931657,"As tweeted by Kappische: [A summary of the Scrolls verdict in English](http://i.imgur.com/t8s3p.png)  ZeniMax Media lnc., owner of Bethesda Softworks, initiated proceedings for trademark infringement against Mojang AB. The District Court of Stockholm has now made a decision on Zenimax's claim for an interim (preliminary) injunction, which would, if granted, have prohibited Mojang at the penalty of a ﬁne from continuing use of the title SCROLLS until the case is ﬁnally settled following main proceedings. Interim injunctions in Sweden are made as part of the main proceedings, but take place within just a few (intense) weeks, usually in writing only.  As a consequence, the Court will usually have less documentation to base its decision on. The requirements for granting an interim injunction is therefore also lower as compared to a final injunction, since the intention is of obtaining quick relief against an ongoing infringement, where the trademark owner may not have time to collect sufﬁcient evidence. The requirement, which is of “probable grounds"" of infringement, is rather low.  The Court decides on whether or not trademark infringement is at hand based on an overall assessment of risk of confusion. This assessment takes into account several elements, such as how well-known the allegedly infringed trademark is on the market, similarity of the trademarks and similarity of the goods. In essence, the question is asked if the average (hypothetical) consumer would risk becoming confused between the two marks.  The Court in this decision starts by analyzing the goods at hand, ﬁnding ﬁrst that there are significant differences between the games in THE ELDER SCROLLS® series and the game SCROLLS, and that channels of distribution will be different (SCROLLS will only be sold by Mojang on its websites mojang.com and scrolls.com). Nevertheless. the Court ﬁnds that there are similarities as well - both games/series taking place in a fantasy setting, and that consumers appear to be somewhat overlapping. and that as a consequence. there is a relatively high degree of similarity of goods.  The Court then goes on to discuss the consumers of these kinds of games. ZeniMax's opinion is that it is the general public, which holds no particular awareness of differences between various titles and games. Mojang on the contrary, has argued that computer and video gamers constitute a well deﬁned (albeit large) group which is very much aware of differences between various games and titles. The Court ﬁnds mostly with Mojang. agreeing that the relevant consumers are not the general public, and that their awareness is higher than normal.  On similarity of THE ELDER SCROLLS® and SCROLLS. the Court states that there is a certain degree of similarity. However, as Mojang has argued, scrolls feature frequently in titles and as content in fantasy settings, and in particular in fantasy games. The word scrolls therefore is oonsidered to be common and therefore less distinctive and as a consequence less important. The distinctiveness of THE ELDER SCROLLS® is therefore to a great extent considered dependent on use of the trademark as a whole, meaning that the risk of confusion with SCROLLS is relatively low. The Court therefore, in its overall assessment, does not consider there to be shown probable grounds for trademark infringement.  The decision can be appealed within three weeks. The Court of Appeal will then have to grant leave to appeal in order for the decision to be tried on appeal. Otherwise the main proceedings will continue. Such usually take over a year. and may take up to two years. The decision is very good for Mojang since the Court does not oonsider SCROLLS to infringe THE ELDER SCROLLS®, even taking into account the relatively low requirement of probable grounds.  edit: typo",®

We knew that Aerowash was alkaline and that it would corrode aluminum and that it would also remove the oil from rubber parts and make them deteriorate rapidly.  Yes, there *is* oil in rubber tires and other parts.  There's probably a pint of amber colored oil in your tire which was added to the natural and synthetic rubber when your tire's tread was compounded at the factory.  According to tires engineers, this oil extends the rubber's range of dynamic elasticity...  Simple Green will wash this oil off the surface of your tires, and the oil remaining in your tires will come to the surface.  If you keep washing your tires with Simple Green, your tires will dry out and become hard, or *inelastic*.  Your link refers to Extreme Simple Green® Aircraft &amp; Precision Cleaner. This product is probably so close to the Aerowash we used in the Air Force as to be indistinguishable.  I was working as an engineering lab tech at Stainless Steel Products in Burbank about 30 years ago and we received some pneumatic ducts returned from the Persian Gulf for repairs.  They were made of titanium for lightness.  Unfortunately, whoever degreased them prior to shipping didn't get all the green alkaline cleaner out of all the hidden crevices.

Both liquors and liqueurs contain alcohol, but the terms are not interchangable.*  *Answer: This question confuses many, and with good reason. Many liquors are available in flavored forms nowadays. Both liquors and liqueurs contain alcohol, but the terms are not interchangeable.*   *In general, liqueurs are sweetened spirits with various flavors, oils, and extracts. Liqueur alcohol content can range from a low 15 percent (30 proof) to 55 percent (110 proof), so potency is not a distinguishing factor. Rum, whiskey, brandy, and other liquors can serve as a base spirit for liqueurs. Cream liqueurs have cream added, while créme liqueurs are much sweeter, likened to a potent syrup. Our ancestors referred to liqueurs as cordials, and they were often used medicinally. Grand Marnier® is a delicious example of an orange liqueur which makes a flavorful ingredient in many recipes.*  *Liquor is an alcoholic beverage made of grains or other plants which is fermented into a potent drink. Although sugar is generally used in the fermentation process, the resulting liquor is not sugary sweet. Liquors are nowadays available in flavored forms, but they are not sweet to the palate. The flavor is usually added after distilling through a steeping process, much like vinegars and oils are infused.*  Totally different things.

t5_2rz8w,StilRH,1318983460,"Well done for making this decision :) You can do it!  Advice? As eager as you are to go, start slow and go steady. It's so hard to push yourself mentally and physically to the point where you have an injury or your willpower just cracks and have a relapse in bad behaviors. Especially with the exercise, but also (and I wish people had told me this in the past) dieting - some people can go straight to vastly reduced calories, but that's not for everyone, if you have the discipline plan the occasional treat, but don't reward yourself with food.  Make some clear goals. Short, mid and long. It feels good to achieve something every now and then (shorter term goals), but you need to have your reach a bit higher than just 5lb or 10lbs lost (mid-long term goals). Have a target weight (you can always take more off once you reach your goal) but also look for other measures of progress - measurements taken with a tape measure, clothing size, fitness, energy, etc etc to help motivate you and also let you know what scales might not be able to tell you (eg. the points where muscle mass gained is equal to fat lost, you're making great progress but the scale registers zero change).  Plan how a time frame to these. Honestly - some things expand or shrink to the time allotted to them. There will be more pressure to act so you meet your deadline (and if you miss it, never mind, redraw the line and start again :)). Be reasonable and aim for a healthy rate of lose. People usually shed a lot fast when they first make some big changes to diet and exercise, then the rate of lose will level out. Usually. Let other people know what you're up to so you have accountability. It keeps you honest! I think weightloss blogs, r/loseit and social network sites for those aiming to change their weight are some of the best tools. IF you use them properly.  Be clear how you're going to lose weight. Count calories in your diet so you know what's going in and measure what exercise you do. Timing yourself on the bike is great, but get a distance too so you don't deceive yourself with peddling slower for longer and actually doing less work than you think. It's ok to not know everything at the start, and remember that the plan can change, say you discover a new sport or cooking style (stir fry is your friend :)) and you want to use that to switch it up or you discover new things. The people I've seen lose weight tend to go through different phases, so you might want to change your needs as they adjust.  Until recently I was out of work, depressed (still am :/) and eating poorly - but it can be a weight loss boon, the free time. Take a long walk after each meal and maybe do some volunteering. Not just improve your body but also make friends, boost your mood and career prospects? Being out of the house will put food out of reach and say you do something physical (we in the UK have a 'green gym' basically you do some conservation, clearing fallen trees, litter picking, managing the green areas and woodlands etc etc doesnt feel like working out but it sure is a good session!!) it could be more exercise for you.  tl,dr; research SMART targets, follow through, get out more.  Good luck‼",‼

t5_2qyn1,StilRH,1318984162,"That would honestly scale with my available resources, rate of production, ease of resupply (how many ammo stockpiles scattered close to where they're needed), the importance of having supplied archers (compared to say using that wood for making steel etc etc)  Other bolts come out in bigger batches, 30 I think? But bone bolts make 5 at a time from a single bone. To make 250 of those I would need 50 production cycles. To make 2500 of those (to give 250 bolts to 10 marksdwarves) it would take 500 cycles. **IF** I have the 500 bones to spare...  I have only recently thought about ammo, because usually i have lots of it (production on loop for hunters) before i seriously start training my archers. So this is new territory for me too. I think the first dwarf to come across the ammo will put it in his quiver, and usually everyone gets an equal share - but in a few forts I've not seen that, so some ‼science‼ is needed to see how arming and re-equipping works.",‼

t5_2qh1i,n8ls,1318994024,"Supercoil A contortion in DNA that occurs as a consequence to over- or under-twisting of the DNA helix. Supercoils can  be introduced during DNA packaging and DNA–RNA synthesis. T opoisomerases sense supercoiling and can either generate or dissipate it by changing DNA topology.  Centromere The region of a chromosome that is attached to the spindle during nuclear division.  Kinetochore A large multiprotein complex that assembles onto the centromere of the chromosome and links it to the microtubules of the mitotic spindle. The kinetochore is also a signalling centre for many of the proteins that control the progression of mitosis.  (fIG. 1c) can wrap DNA in either a right-handed helix (positive supercoils) or a left-handed helix (negative supercoils). The addition of two H2A–H2B dimers forms an octamer (fIG. 1d) with a left-handed helical  ramp that locks the DNA into a negatively super-coiled configuration20. The H2A–H2B dimers form weak 4HBs between the α2 and α3 helices of H4 and H2B. Octameric nucleosomes occur in all eukaryotes except possibly dinoflagellates, which have lost bulk histones21. Other eukaryotic histone variants (centromeric his-tone variant H3 (CenH3; also known as CENP-A in humans, chromosome segregation protein 4 (Cse4)  in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and centromere identifier (CID) in Drosophila melanogaster), H3.3, H2A.Z and H2A.X) are also of near universal occurrence, dating back to the earliest known diversifications of eukaryotic line-ages22. As in archaeal histones, these universal variants can alter the fundamental structure of the nucleosome  and its stability.  CenH3 — a right-handed wrap artist. Centromere-specific histone variants are essential for assembly of the kineto-chore23. Centromere-specific H3s inhabit diverse forms of centromeres and are rapidly evolving4. They are far less conserved than canonical H3s (see Supplementary information S2 (table)), and phylo genetic analysis  cannot rule out multiple origins for them in the H3 fam-ily22,24. The term CenH3 was therefore introduced25 to refer functionally to all centromere-specific histones whether or not they had a common origin with the first described example, mammalian CENP-A26. However, a single origin for CenH3s is parsimonious, and we regard CenH3 and CENP-A as equivalent terms. CenH3s have ~ 50–60% identity with canonical H3s in the HFD and no conservation in the N-terminal tails. They have longer, non-conserved L1s22 and usually replace Phe84 in H3 with Trp (residue numbers refer to the canonical human histones). CenH3 tails and L1s are under positive selection in some plants and animals4. Oligopeptide motifs that bind the minor groove of DNA have evolved recurrently in the  N-terminal tails of several CenH3s, including human CENP-A27. Although lacking sequence specificity, these minor groove-binding motifs prefer AT-rich DNA28, which might be relevant to binding usually AT-rich centromeres. Despite this putative compositional pref-erence, centromere specification is epigenetic and the mechanisms that maintain CenH3s at centromeres are not well understood3,4. CenH3 from the budding yeast S. cerevisiae, Cse4, can substitute for human CENP-A29, which suggests that they form equivalent nucleosome structures despite considerable sequence divergence. CenH3 nucleosomes exhibit unusual properties, however, that have made interpreting their structure difficult and controversial. They have traditionally been interpreted as octamers, but unlike canonical nucleosomes that protect ~ 150 bp of DNA from nucleases, native D. melanogaster CenH3 (CID) nucleosomes protect much less30. Measurements by atomic force microscopy show that CID nucleosomes   are only half the height of canonical nucleosomes30, sug-gesting that they are also half the volume. In addition, like some archaeal histones, CenH3 nucleosomes in D. melanogaster and yeast induce positive supercoils  in DNA, implying a right-handed wrap of DNA31, in contrast to the left-handed wrap of canonical nucleo-somes1. D. melanogaster CID nucleosomes contain one molecule each of CID, H4, H2B and H2A and are proposed to resemble half of an octameric nucleo-some30 (fIG. 1e) or a hemisome2. By contrast, the yeast Cse4 nucleosome was proposed to consist of a hexamer of two molecules each of Cse4, H4 and suppressor of chromosome missegregation 3 (Scm3), but to lack H2A and H2B32. Scm3 has homologues in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe and in mammals that are essential for CenH3 deposition4. A more recent study concluded that Scm3 is not part of the Cse4 nucleo-some because overexpressing Cse4 rescues an Scm3 deletion33. Moreover, the detection of H2A and H2B in Cse4 particles implies that either a hemisome or octameric nucleosome occupies yeast centromeres33,34. Co-immunoprecipitation of two differently tagged Cse4 molecules from yeast centromeres has been cited in support of an octameric structure33, but it is unclear whether the tags were on a single nucleosome, and a conventional octamer seems structurally incompatible with a right-handed wrap of DNA31. Either a hemisome or a (CenH3–H4)2 tetrameric nucleosome is theoreti-cally compatible with a right-handed wrap, although (CenH3–H4)2 tetramers have not been observed33,35. Either tetrameric model would require a conforma-tional change in the central 4HB. In the hemisome model, the longer L1 in CenH3 has been proposed to bring about the conformational change in the adjacent H4–H2B 4HB. The positively supercoiled tetramers are proposed to resist the mitotic condensation affect-ing adjacent negatively supercoiled H3-containing octamers, thereby providing an accessible asymmetric nucleosome surface on which to assemble kinetochore proteins and a possible topological basis for epigenetic inheritance of CenH3 at the centromere31,36.  Does H3.3 do more than replace H3? In addition to CenH3, most eukaryotes have two similar H3 family members commonly called canonical H3 and replace-ment H3.3. In most animals, H3.3 differs from H3 by just four amino acid substitutions, including residue 31 in the N-terminal tail, which is an Ala in H3 and a Ser in H3.3, and substitutions at residues 87, 89, and 90 near the beginning of α2. Similarly, in other eukaryotes, differences include Ser or Thr versus Ala at residue 31 and differences at residues 87 and 89 or 90 and some-times others — a total of 16 in the ciliate Tetrahymena thermophil a37. Whereas H3 is assembled during rep-lication in D. melanogaster, H3.3 can undergo either replication-coupled or replication-independent assem-bly. The three substitutions in α2 of D. melanogaster H3 exclude it from replication-independent assembly38. Insight into these H3.3 assembly modes first came from human HeLa cells, in which the major canoni-cal H3 (H3.1) is assembled into chromatin by the   REVIEWS  266 | APRIL 2010 | VOLUME 11  www.nature.com/reviews/molcellbio  © 20 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

t5_2qhg1,night_owl,1319022156,"&gt;There is a difference between between a brewpub or micro-brewery who make beer and then use contract brewing to meet a rising demand and just going out with a recipe, contracting with a mega-brewery to brew for you and then pretending to be a small craft brewery.  what?  Sam Adams *is* craft brewer by every definition--they don't have to pretend.  They have contracted with corporate mega-brewers.  Those two things are not mutually exclusive.  Sam Adams is not *owned* by a corporate mega-brewer, they *do business with* corporate mega-brewers.    Let me explain this in as simple as terms as possible since this doesn't seem to be sinking in.  - Boston Brewing Co started as an independent brewer, making all their own beer in-house.   - They grew fast--expanding capacity as they went and buying additional brewing facilities in Pennsylvania and Cincinnati.   &gt;A Tale of Two Breweries  &gt;Without the capital to build a world-class brewery, Jim began by brewing in a century old brewery in Pennsylvania while renovating part of the old and largely abandoned Haffenreffer Brewery in an old brewing neighborhood in Boston. The Boston Brewery opens in 1988 and remains a lure for beer pilgrims today. To date, over 300,000 have made their way to this brewing mecca in Boston. Koch proudly brews Samuel Adams Boston Lager® using the time-honored, traditional four vessel brewing process.  &gt;In the mid-1990s Jim returns to his hometown of Cincinnati to purchase the Hudepohl-Schoenling Brewery, a place where his father had apprenticed in the 1940s. In January 2005, Jim embarks on a major renovation and expansion of the Samuel Adams Brewery in Cincinnati.  &gt;In June of 2008, The Boston Beer Company took ownership of a world-class brewery with a distinguished history of brewing great beers. Located in the Lehigh Valley in Pennsylvania, the Samuel Adams Pennsylvania Brewery today employs over 200 people and produces nearly every style of Samuel Adams beers.  (from the Sam Adams website)  - They couldn't keep up with demand while dealing with renovations and planning to potentially purchase another brewing facility so they contracted out *some* of the brewing--which is the content of your 4-year-old link.  They later bought one of the breweries who was doing their contract brewing.    I don't know if they still do any contract brewing, but the info in the article you linked to is way out of date (they have actually purchased an entire brewery since that was published) anyway so none of it is even relevant to that issue anymore anyway, but it never says anywhere that Miller does all of their brewing and they don't make any of their own beer because that is not true.  Let it die man.  You can hate Sam Adams if you want and it won't bother me any--shit, I only drink Sam Adams about once every other year myself and I think their beers are all either boring or bad--but get your facts straight.

t5_2qh1s,lensman00,1319044802,"The middle class pay nowhere near 50% in taxes. I'm a median earner and pay about 27 or 28% in state, federal and other taxes in a bad year (a year with no major deductions). The state I live in (Oregon) is a somewhat high tax state according to most business interests and the Tax Foundation.  If you draw up a worst case scenario I think you can get a middle earner's total tax burden up around 40% but they really have to be making all the wrong moves in terms of their choice of where to live and work along with missing virtually all the exemptions and deductions.   Even the Tax Foundation's ""Tax Freedom Day"" analysis, which uses mean income and tax instead of median income and tax as a proxy for the middle class, puts the average tax burden at about 28%.  ""Tax Freedom Day® will arrive on April 12 this year, the 102nd day of 2011.

t5_2qhue,cannotdecide9,1319064055,"Yes there is.  It is a *family* of opamps (and comparators) from Linear Technology, called ""Over The Top"".  One example is the LT1636 [DATSHEET HERE](http://cds.linear.com/docs/Datasheet/1636fc.pdf).     &gt; Over-The-Top®: Input Common Mode Range Extends 44V Above VEE, Independent of VCC     &gt; The LT1636 has a unique input stage that operates and remains high impedance when above the positive supply. The inputs take 44V both differential and common mode, even when operating on a 3V supply. The output swings to both supplies.     ""But how do they DO that?""     &gt; The LT1636 has two input stages, NPN and PNP (see Simplified Schematic), resulting in three distinct operating regions as shown in the Input Bias Current vs Common Mode typical performance curve.     &gt; For input voltages about 0.8V or more below V+, the PNP input stage is active and the input bias current is typically –4nA. When the input voltage is about 0.5V or less from V+, the NPN input stage is operating and the input bias current is typically 10nA. Increases in temperature will cause the voltage at which operation switches from the PNP stage to the NPN stage to move towards V+. The input offset voltage of the NPN stage is untrimmed and is typically 600μV.     &gt; A Schottky diode in the collector of each NPN transistor of the NPN input stage allows the LT1636 to operate with either or both of its inputs above V+. At about 0.3V above V+ the NPN input transistor is fully saturated and the input bias current is typically 3μA at room temperature. The input offset voltage is typically 600μV when operating above V+. The LT1636 will operate with its input 44V above V– regardless of V+.     &gt; The inputs are protected against excursions as much as 22V below V – by an internal 1k resistor in series with each input and a diode from the input to the negative supply.

t5_2rd9v,bodhi30,1319065910,"Hello All :)  Thank you for the love, fellow redditors.  Ready?  Ok.  Here we go.  * 5-6 Plum Tomatoes * 1 medium onion (I like the white onion but I suppose you can use others if you prefer them.  No one will die.  People may hate your pico and call you names though) * 1 or 2 Jalapeno (pronounced jah-lap-pen-o) * cilantro * one lime * salt/pepper   SHARPEN YOUR KNIFE.  Seriously.  This recipe is fast if you have a freshly sharpened knife because tomatoes are a pain in the skin.  1. Have a shot of tequila, turn up your favourite 80’s station, and begin.  2.  Dice the onion.  Keep in mind that you want to try and make all the ingredients the same diced size. I want each ingredient sitting on my chippy in equal proportions so I dice everything the size of a black eye pea.  3.  Have a sip of your Corona/Modelo/other fine Mexican beer.  We’re Mexican today!  4.  Quarter tomatoes and scoop out the squishy insides.  Use a spoon for scooping out seeds because it’s fast.  Throw the dog a slice because he’ll eat anything.  5.  Mix while speaking to your pretend audience.  Yes, I do this.  EVERY SINGLE TIME.  It works  6.  Lastly, slice the jalapeno in half and scoop out the seeds.  Be a man and use your hands sans gloves so they burn all night.  Anything else is for weaklings.  If you’re a real bad-ass, take your contacts off.  Dice into VERY VERY tiny pieces.  7.  Squeeze the lime juice in.  Stir.    8.  Let that sit while you wash and shake the cilantro dry outside of your kitchen window so droplets of water fall on innocent stoop sitters.  9.  Sip some more beer.  10.  Dice like it's 1999.  I don't even separate it.  Just choppity chop chop!  11.  Toss in.  Stir, salt and pepper.  Taste.  And taste some more.  And maybe one more taste.  Toss in the icebox.  Begin making guacamole.  A Few Notes:  If you don't have jalapenos, skip it.  If you  I like to use two limes for squeezing into the pico because I use the juice as well and ¼ cup pico de gallo to add to the guacamole for flavor.  You can drain excess lime juice out before serving so it's not soggy.  I love lime.  That’s it.  Did I mention to sharpen your knife?!    ENJOY!  And I’d love to see your photos ☺   ",☺

t5_mouw,Shampyon,1319181243,"&gt;I thought by now folks(especially redditors) would realize the media isn't going to report on anything unless it is in one way or another beneficial to the multinational corporations that own most of the world's wealth  Which is why they cover news of drugs being tampered with and give air time to people who make baseless claims like ""My baby got autism from mercury in his vaccine!"" even though the vaccine he got didn't have mercury in it and he's not actually autistic.  &gt; HPV vaccines which the FDA admits has killed 100+ girls are great  Where did you get that figure?  &gt;As of June 22, 2011 **there have been a total 68 VAERS reports of death among those who have received Gardasil**® . There were 54 reports among females, 3 were among males, and 11 were reports of unknown gender. Thirty two of the total death reports have been confirmed and **36 remain unconfirmed due to no identifiable patient information** in the report such as a name and contact information to confirm the report. A death report is confirmed (verified) after a medical doctor reviews the report and any associated records. **In the 32 reports confirmed, there was no unusual pattern or clustering to the deaths that would suggest that they were caused by the vaccine and some reports indicated a cause of death unrelated to vaccination.**  [Source](http://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/Vaccines/HPV/gardasil.html)  &gt;Letting the government implement a world tax on carbon dioxide in the name of global warming is a great idea!  That's political policy, not scientific research.  &gt;Giving kids 60+ vaccines before they reach the age of 5 is awesome!  Given the alternative, yes.  &gt; If you do have a serious adverse reaction you have no way of getting accountability because they are legally immune.  Certain adverse reactions are covered as part of the cost/benefit. Adverse reactions that are avoidable are not.

t5_2qh1i,ax4of9,1319208908,"Ahh..so if a lot of people don't read the EULAs, they don't mean anything?   Yes, I read most user agreements online. Including the one on LinkedIn that I linked you to in another answer, but which you deemed unworthy of a reply. I have read enough user agreements that I know more or less what is going to be there in the user agreement of a website.   I love it that somehow, not reading the EULA is a valid excuse, even though at the bottom of every page of Reddit, it says ""Use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy. © 2011 reddit inc. All rights reserved."" I think the next time I buy a loaf of bread, I'll leave it till its moldy and then eat it. This way, I can sue the bread company and claim I didn't read the expiry date.   Finally, lets get to the crux of your point. You're afraid that creative people (obviously not yourself) might be at a disadvantage after posting something on reddit. Since we are ONLY talking about comments (pictures are hosted on imgur and linked from here, so it doesn't count. But I do wonder what imgur's user terms are.) we are talking about writers.   Maybe they are novel writers. Maybe they are poets. Serious ""creative"" people who are looking to get published know exactly what to look out for. There are tons of resources for aspiring writers. They are told, often explicitly, that publishing something on your blog loses you the first world rights. They are told publishing something on a forum loses you exclusive rights. Most importantly, they are told to never, ever post the entirety of their work online if they want to sell it later.   Now, maybe you are talking specifically about this James Erwin guy. Someone who did this by accident. Who was discovered by accident, because his talent shone through like a diamond in the rought. So let's talk about James Erwin. Is there going to be a lawsuit between Reddit and WB? Nope. Is there going to be a lawsuit between WB and Erwin? Unlikely. Is there going to be a lawsuit between Reddit and Erwin? Nope.   Why? How can I be sure? Firstly, Reddit owns the **license** to the words posted on the site. Erwin posted his flash fiction on Askreddit, which means reddit has the license to re-publish that flash fiction. There is, however, a problem. WB is not after those paragraphs of flash fiction. Erwin was discovered by Adam Kolbrenner, and together they pitched WB the idea of the screenplay. Who is writing the screenplay? Erwin. Is the screenplay posted on Reddit? No. Does Reddit have any rights to this screenplay? Nop. Does WB have the exclusive rights to this screenplay? Yes. Why is there a lawsuit again?  The only reason why everyone here thinks there is a lawsuit, is because you linked to a website that simply casted doubts on whether the user agreement might have an effect on deals such as this. An article that somehow still thought that Reddit was owned by Conde Nast.   You took that article, and slapped a sensationalist headline on it saying that:  &gt;In what was posted on r/cyberlaws a few hours ago, it seems there is going to be a [1] legal battle between Conde Nast and Warner Bross.  This is despite the fact that the only quote from someone associated with Reddit is the copyright agent who only provided the quotes ""interesting question"" and declined to elaborate. Despite the fact that when the article linked to Conde Nast's ""robust licensing activity"", it was an article about putting Conde Nast's magazine titles on restaurants.   You make so many groundless claims it's incredible. Its not just the make belief lawsuit part. You say   &gt;I love Reddit dearly with all my heart, it has brought a lot of happiness to a lot of users, some of that was thanks to the fact that people did not need to worry about copyrights  Really? People did not need to worry about copyrights? What gave them that idea? Here you are, implying that something which set Reddit apart from other places online was the fact that people had no copyright worries here. Which means other places had such worries, but Reddit didn't. Again, what gave you that idea? Maybe, you imagined it?   In fact, I suspect there are many things that you imagined. Maybe you imagined that you were standing up for the ""creative"" small guys against big bad corporate Reddit! Maybe you thought that this EULA was uniquely evil and it meant that Conde Nast was coming to get you! Maybe, you imagine that one day you will write a paragraph of such brilliance on reddit that publishers will be falling themselves to sign you, only to walk away when they realise they can't get exclusive rights. Maybe you imagine that publishers, instead of wanting to sign a writer who displays his talent on an internet forum to write new material that is fresh and polished, they would only want to buy the content that is posted online. Maybe you imagine that someone who is truly talented will have a flash of brilliance on reddit and yet is forever unable to repeat the feat.    You know, maybe I'm an asshole.    But after replying to you and seeing your conversations regarding this topic, I'm very sure you're an ignorant troll who is only interested in raising a ruckus and creating discontent.  ",©

t5_2qq5p,Exofusion,1319350690,"FTA:  CHANGE.  The World is in big change now...  We are changing...   The Tribes have left Ozora. Spirit is gone!  After 8 prosperous and joyful years, Daniel (the farmer of the land) decided to take the whole festival in his hand. He beleives he can do it as he owns the land and the event is big enough to carry on alone by itself. We have been trying to convince him for the last 2 months, but he did not even listen to the facts and the suggestions collected by us to improve the Festival rather than destroying it in his sudden strange mood.  We beleive that it is much more that has been born at Ozora, not just the name he registered, the ground and the big money behind it - but a lot of personal love and hard work.  Everybody who worked in the Ozora Team have added a lot of effort and enthusiasm. All the artists have added their vision, many of them for free. Everybody dancing there added his own vibration. And Love again. That is what can not be counted. And also it can not be missed...  The owner's decision was purely made on 'financial interests', although almost 99% of the income went to that 1 place. Does it sound familiar? The old money-pyramid again, and probably it's time to think of a new system.  So we go different ways... No fighting back, rather looking into the future.. making the best of the Present.   We are happy and sad in the same time. But we must follow our heart and not the greedy needs.. Different ways of thinking, different ways of life.  We have a beautiful vision with long years of experience and knowledge...  The ones who must leave 'O.Z.O.R.A':  Bubble Balazs - main-organiser Oleg - ex-organiser, music, web Edit - graphic designer Amin - Access All Areas's father figure Alpha - music &amp; stage  Peter Didjital - music &amp; stage Extradimensional Space Agency - main stage decor Martin Audio - sound system Pumpui crew - visuals, movie, before &amp; after party Viki - shops Csaba, Cuki and their nice friends - Magic Garden and workshop keepers, jugglers, builders, workers, the travel crew and many artists like Raja Ram, Simon Posford &amp; the whole Twisted Crew, Atmos, Ace Ventura, Liquid Soul, Man with no Name, Tristan, the PsyBaba family, the Ultimae Records family... and many more.  Thank you for all of your support!  We believe in you more than ever!!!  Together we can keep the Spirit of Ozora... w We can even create something better.  Our collective dream has huge energies...  Funnily enough this year the chosen sign was the 'Rise of the Phoenix', in other way 'Flight of the Garuda'... Symbols. :) Who knows? Maybe it's time to leave one stage behind...   So this is the news now.  By the internet we can stay connected, more info soon.  Thank you all !!!  Love &amp; Light  FROM OZORA CREW admin says: October 20, 2011 at 12:24 pm This is the final decision, there will be Ozora 2012 but we wont be there. Thank you for your support, we definitely looking for making a new festival, and it seems like the artist are also with us. The vision is to keep this creative community together on our own land, and build a little state in a state. We soon have updates… ♥   ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥   Ozora Festival is about the collective efforts of many and the paradise we experience is created by love and passion of all members of crew, artists, decor and party goers.   Without this, Ozora would not be same.   This festival is about love and unity, and as party goers we are saying we will not attend you're money making festival as that is not what we believe in.  This is a strong message to Daniel (THE LAND OWNER), there are many who look forward to this all year round, and much love and passion is put into this. Please re think you're plans to create Ozora on your own, Otherwise WE the Ozora people will stay in spirit and solidarity with the original crew and will attend THEIR new festival, where ever it will be ♥  Peace Love and Unity.

t5_2qstm,pentium4borg,1319384139,"I have accounts at Ally too, and I've mostly been pleased with them. You really can't beat unlimited ATM fee refunds. Their savings rates have been declining recently which I'm not a huge fan of.  I have accounts at several places (so I can use the best features of each). For the highest rates, I opened accounts at [Alliant credit union](http://alliantcreditunion.org). (Anyone can join with a $10 charitable donation, then they give you your first $5.) So far they have been really good. Similar to Ally, they support check deposit via scanner. Also, since they're part of the [shared branching](http://www.cuswirl.com) network, you can make deposits/withdrawals at any nearby credit union that's part of the network.  Credit cards are a bit different. Don't ever carry a balance, that's how the banks make the most money from credit cards. I would get a reward card and just put your normal spending on whatever card you get, that way you are getting cash back (my favorite)/miles/whatever for spending money you were going to spend anyway. Also, to get the best credit rating, don't use more than 30% of your credit limit, and wait until the statement is generated before you pay the balance (but then pay it off in full). If you pay it before the statement is generated, your usage might not be reported correctly to the credit bureaus.  &gt; I've been looking into USAA, and really seem to like there features, for example the USAA Deposit@Home® / Deposit@Mobile® seem really awesome, and it would be the answer I'm looking for. But is this feature only for people who have military ties?  Yes, anyone can sign up for checking/savings at USAA but you need to be military/related to use their smartphone check deposit.  &gt; Also, I've been looking into Schwab Bank High Yield Investor Checking, seems like it offers a lot of features Ally already provides, but I read somewhere that they also do a scan the check deposit, similar to USAA.

t5_2qm4e,DefiantDragon,1319557358,"Also: Here's their list of ingredients (and what they say about how they work):  **GPC Choline – 100 mg**  Derived from lecithin, Glyceryl Phosphoryl Choline is a phospholipid metabolite found concentrated in neuronal membranes. Unlike less expensive forms of Choline such as Choline Bitrartate, GPC choline is well absorbed and easily crosses the blood brain barrier. Once delivered it supports brain function and learning processes by directly increasing the synthesis and secretion of acetylcholine. Strong acetylcholine has been linked to memory, focus, mental drive, REM sleep states, and the prevention of mental degradation such as in Alzheimers.  **Huperzia Serrata (.5% Huperzine A) – 50 mg**  Commonly known as Northern Firmoss, Huperzia Serrata is one of the most effective natural acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. It contains the well studied alkaloid Huperzine A, which has been tested in a variety of clinical applications and shown to have positive effects on brain function. Acetylcholinesterase (ACE) is responsible for the breakdown of Acetylcholine, and so by inhibiting ACE, more acetylcholine is available to the brain. By using the full spectrum Huperzia Serrata vs. Huperzine A, you also get the benefits of Huperzine B, and other balancing elements of the whole herb.  **Vinpocetine — 5mg**  Derived from the periwinkle plant, vinpocetine helps deliver oxygen to the brain by increasing circulation and blood flow. Extensively studied in Europe, clinical investigations have found it to provide several advantages for the human brain, including memory enhancement, increased cognitive performance, improved cerebral circulation and higher mental acuity and awareness.  **AC-11 – 350mg**  AC-11® the proprietary compound licensed under agreement from Optigenex Inc, is derived from Uncaria Tomentosa, a plant indigenous to the South American rainforest. In a series of peer reviewed scientific and clinical studies conducted by third party laboratories and university medical centers, AC-11® has been shown to help the body’s natural ability to repair DNA. Optigenex Inc is the exclusive patent holder for AC-11®. US patent numbers: 6039949, 6238675 B1, 6361805 B2 Although the exact mechanisms of action are being further investigated, the scientists believe that when the body is subjected to stress affecting the integrity of the DNA, AC-11® helps activate enzymes that are instrumental in the repair processes. This goes beyond other nutritional supplement by protecting the body from damage to its fundamental building blocks: The DNA itself.  **Bacopa (20% Bacosides) — 500 mg**  Bacopa monnieri is an Ayurvedic herb found in the marshlands of India known to enhance clear thinking and support memory function. Ayurvedic masters have touted its cognitive enhancing effects for centuries as Bacopa has been served to Raj’s and peasants alike. Clinical studies show that it has strong antioxidant properties, protects mental function in those with epilepsy who take the drug phenytion, and animal models have shown unequivocally that bacopa improves learning skills.  Bacosides, the active compounds in Bacopa, play a protective role in the synaptic functions of the nerves in the hippocampus, the seat of memory. Inside the hippocampus nerve impulses are transmitted across the synapses and bacopa is believed to help prevent the degeneration that impairs memory and cognition.  **Pterostilbene — 250 mcg**  One of the hottest extracts in the field of nootropics, pterostilbene is quickly surpassing its cousin resveratrol in popularity. A natural antioxidant abundant in blueberries, anecdotal evidence suggests that this particular antioxidant is effective in eliminating free radicals that contribute to ‘mental fog’. Combined with the other antioxidants in the formula, this adds further well rounded protection and health benefits to AlphaBrain.  **Mucuna Pruriens (50% l-Dopa) — 200mg**  Mucuna pruriens, commonly known as velvet bean or cowhage is another Aryuvedic herb with a long history of traditional use for treatment of the brain. As science later discovered, mucuna is one of the few plants to contain high quantities of l-Dopa, a precursor to the neurotransmitter dopamine. L-dopa crosses the blood brain barrier and converts into dopamine, an important brain chemical involved in mood, sexuality, and movement. Mucuna pruriens also has antioxidant properties and is currently being studied in conjunction with the prevention/treatment of Parkinson’s disease.  **GABA — 300mg**  GABA or gamma-aminobutyric acid, discovered in 1950, is the most important and widespread inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain. Symptoms of unbalanced excitation in the brain includes restlessness, irritability, insomnia, and even seizures. By inhibiting excessive excitability GABA is able to induce relaxation, analgesia, and even aid in sleep. In the Alpha Brain formula, GABA plays an important role in balancing out the brain, and ensuring that the mind stays calm even as the ‘engines’ are roaring.  **Oat Straw (10:1) — 300 mg**  Oat straw is one of natures most powerful anxiolytics (anti-anxiety treatments) and has been prescribed for of a wide range of nervous conditions. It has also been shown to help with exhaustion related neurological pains and is commonly given as a natural alternative to help combat ADHD or ADD. Our formulation is extremely powerful, in a 10:1 concentration, and like Gaba, serves to make AlphaBrain the completely unique product that it is… A balanced nootropic.  **Vitamin B6 – 15 mg**  Pyridoxine (Vitamin B6) is one of the body’s busiest vitamins, involved in an estimated 101 chemical reactions. One of its primary tasks is to aid in the manufacturing of amino acids and neurotransmitters. Some of these neurotransmitters are serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine and GABA. Without Vitamin B6 many of the processes happening with the active ingredients in the formula would not be nearly as effective.",®

t5_2rfxx,Boibi,1319661277,"&gt; ♣ HOW TO FIX:  I'm going to change this for you, ok?  &gt; So in the end there is only like 3 base stats actually needed: Health(increases health), Damage(increases damage done by spells and auto-attacks), Force (increases mana and cd redux).  What you've actually described here is Bloodline Champions. Go try it out and see if you like it. I also think you would like BLC because it doesn't have anything specifying between magical and physical damage. Damage is just all damage.  &gt; Items have levels - upgrading item costs money and gives increased effect that item gives.  You either want to look at SpellShards/Codex in HoN, or you want to wait for Blizzard DotA to come out and play that. There are a couple other HoN items that do this, but I play way too many supports and casters to know about anything other than Spellshards, Codex, and Staff. /joking about stagnant HoN item builds.  &gt; About gold - last hitting is bull**** and gives nothing.  Once again, you might want to wait for Blizzard DotA. If that's not your pool of fun, try out Demigod. It has a near empty playerbase, but if you buy it and want to try it out, I'm game.   And random comments about your rant. There's a reason you're required to take specific stats if you want particular effects. It's so that you can weigh the cost effectiveness of an item in relation to your character. For example, there's no reason to buy mana on Akali, but a Sheen on her proves incredibly useful.  Dominion hasn't failed just because you don't like it. I think the meta for Dom is still in infancy and people need to be less of sticklers about how Dominion meta works.  About the chess analogy... [Steve Jackson games thinks vanilla chess is boring](http://www.sjgames.com/knightmare/). And truthfully, Knightmare chess is incredibly fun. I still love vanilla chess, but there are times when this is fun too.  Also, if you're going to make a post this long, when English isn't your first language (and if it is.... I'm so sorry...), then get someone to proofread your posts.  **TLDR** You want to be playing a different game. That's completely within your power. You don't need the devs to change this game to fit your liking, when there are so many other games out there that fit your descriptions. Go play them. I do. And I love them.",♣

t5_2qhh7,snyper7,1319684713,"I consider being able to stand up for yourself a survival skill and a basic pillar of life. Taking the “huddle and cry in the corner,” or the “run home to mommy” approaches to someone saying something mean to you isn’t a sustainable way to live in my book. Perhaps you disagree? If you can’t stand up for yourself, the only way to make it is to surround yourself with people who make no judgments, say nothing you disagree with, and make zero attempt to manipulate you in any way. If those are the people in your life, I’m sorry because they sound very boring. The LGBT community lives in a far from perfect world. Sometimes things aren’t going to go your way. You might get into a fight. And you may lose. You might get in trouble for defending yourself. I believe these are things that are important to learn to live with and accept. It’s not fair, and it sucks, but it is a reality.  In your life you will fall, you will fail, and then you will get back up. If you can’t, you won’t survive.  The reality of the world is that people are going to do say and things that you do not like. If the only thing we tell vulnerable gay kids is that “There’s a safe place somewhere,” or “It’ll get better,” they may be reassured, but they are still left very vulnerable when it hasn’t gotten better and they aren’t in a safe place. There are three approaches to dealing with this problem: Ignorital® (Simpsons reference), move to a different place with exclusively nice people, or change yourself to cope with it. I changed myself. I recognize that not everyone is me, but I still strongly believe that people only have power over you when you let them.  It’s incredibly unhealthy to rely on someone else (a teacher, a parent, a counselor) to exclusively fight your battles for you. What happens when you move to a new city? When you go to college and you can’t say “Professor! Professor! Tommy said a naughty word to me!“? There is standing up for someone by setting an example and there’s standing up for someone by doing everything for them. I’m suggesting the former. I never suggested kids should get aggressive and violent. I suggested they learn to be *assertive*. Show the bullies that making fun of you isn’t worth it.  I’m going to have to disagree with you on your point on internalizing hateful things because I’d consider every thing you listed internalization of something hateful. Hate doesn’t just come from bullies; it’s a part of our world. If your family rejects you – you’ve internalized their hate instead of saying “fuck you” and moving on. If your religion feels you’re better off dead, it sounds like you’ve internalized the teachings of the wrong religion.",®

t5_2rete,randomrealitycheck,1319715301,"First off, please link to page 1 of the story, if possible.  Initially, I was taken aback by the tone of the article, it seemed like the author was dealing with depression but there is a point to the madness which needs to be looked at. Is there anything that the OWS movement will effectively be able to change?  In of itself, I don't see any direct outcome from the protests that would oust the people from government I want to see replaced and putting in people I approve of leading to a change in the system for the better forever.  That statement is not intended to imply that nothing good will ever come from this, I do not believe that to be the case, but I believe it will be the actions that these protests trigger which will make the difference.  I see this as an issue where when you want to get the attention of the people who have money, you hit them where it actually registers as important to them, in their wallets. Specifically, actions like the push to get as many people as possible to move their accounts from the larger banks to the small, local ones will create the desired outcome if they can be done on a large enough scale.  But why just the banks? Instead, by identifying a series of high profile businesses and singling them out for attention a very narrowly defined group of wallets can be affected.  Take the Koch Brothers, as one example.  In the US, if a large enough percentage of the population simply switched from the following brands to any of their competitors thereby creating a large enough drop in these companies cash flow to get noticed, there will be attention paid.  Georgia-Pacific Products:      Angel Soft®     Brawny®     Coronet®     Dixie®     Mardi Gras®     MD Bathroom Tissue     Quilted Northern®     Soft ‘n Gentle®     Sparkle®     Vanity Fair®     Zee®  European brands:      Colhogar®     Delica®     Demak'Up®     Inversoft®     Kitten Soft®     Lotus®     Moltonel®     Nouvelle®     Okay     Tenderly®      Tutto®  In addition, if the unions would refuse to service these companies another level of pressure can be exerted.  No, this won't prevent the Koch brothers from eating or paying their bills but depending on the size and duration of this type of action it will get their attention.",®

t5_2qm4e,visutton,1319772392,"Venusian at Heart   by  Victoria Sutton © 2011   Chapter 1 	“Go! Go!” Janis69 whispers in staccato notes, as she guides each one with her rubber-gloved hand into the tunnel, which could hold either life or death for all of them.  The frightened humans, some barely clothed, some having never seen daylight, some knowing very little of the outside world are very definite about one thing, and that is they want freedom. 	“Don’t look back, just run!” Janis chides them, while giving each one of them a moment of a smile, a token of kindness that resonates with each of them, because they smile back, some worried, some elated, some confused, some tormented.  These were the human subjects of experiment 543A, just another group ordered terminated by Progenitor, the earth’s largest genetic construction company.  Janis is the laboratory director and she has to be careful.  Simply aiding and abetting the escape of human genetic experimental subjects carries the death penalty, and  Janis was the perpetrator.  She had barely gotten a traffic ticket before this had happened.   	A Progenitor guard somehow was alerted at the end of the hallway, which Janis could see from her body monitor mounted on her cleansuit, which she wore for experimentation work.  She saw him stride quickly to his monitoring station at the door, and touch the alarm pad with his index finger, sending a shrieking sound through the corridor with that unmistakable escape alert signal to everyone in the building pod.  In seconds, the place would be crawling with Progenitor specialists with monitors to track them.   The human subjects had tracking devices built into their genes, but getting underground could avoid detection.  That was the only way to escape. 	As Janis literally pushed the last human subject into the tunnel, she caught a view of the little one, for whom she felt a sudden pang of sadness.  She pushed herself back against the wall of the corridor to avoid detection of the tracking beam that flashed toward them, as the secret tunnel entrance folded up camouflaged as a freezer door, becoming a wall between the human’s captivity and their hopes of freedom.  She needed to inch her way to her own escape door before the guards arrived, who for some reason responded much too quickly, eclipsing her own plan to fade back into the building pod. 	“Good Creator!” Janis mutters to herself, as she pulls on the air locked door, that was her escape, now a deathly trap if locked.  Guards thundering into the corridor made her panic mode increase, and she took a deep breath.  One more push and pull, and this time it opens. Janis breathes an audible sigh of relief and slips back into her laboratory’s storeroom, where she would normally be at work.  The fact that she had given an order to destroy the human subjects for the afternoon, was perfectly coordinated with the morning escape.  She had done it before, but each time the odds were growing against her, as the guards adjusted to better responses to the escapes. 	“Dr. 69?” a special investigator entered her laboratory as she shut her escape door behind her. 	“Yes, this is Janis, what can I help you with?” she asked calmly. 	“There has been an escape of human subjects from your laboratory, and we need to ask you about their last holding pod, the ingress, egress from it and anyone who may have last had contact with them,” the special investigator asked as he watched for her reaction. 	“Are you sure?”  I hear the alarm, but why do you think we have human subjects escaping from my laboratory?” Janis asked as much for her own planning as for the part she was playing for time with the guard. 	“A guard caught a glimpse of motion in the corridor on his monitor, but couldn’t say much more about it.  There are 145 human subjects missing from the monitoring count.” 	“Are you certain?  How could they possibly have escaped from our secure pod?” Janis again prods to test her success with the escape. 	“We think there is an escape tunnel somewhere but we have been unable to locate it.  If there is one it is shielded from our detecting devices.” 	“I will search the ID information on each of them, and get it to you as soon as possible, “Janis said, knowing that it would be too late for them to catch them with the ID information that she could give him. 	“Thanks, Dr. 69, I will check in with you later,” the Guard said and left. 	Before Janis had a moment to breathe a sigh of relief, one that had to be undetectable from the surveillance devices in her laboratory which detected her every move, Magellan24, from the Lawyer’s Quad appeared at her door. 	“Another escape of the human subjects, Janis?”  Magellan smiled at her as he leaned against the door opening. 	“Can you believe, another one,” she said without looking up, then cast a smile toward him to punctuate her reply.  Magellan was her hiking buddy and had been her friend since high school.   When about that time, the reality that earth’s temperature had begun to increase much faster than the models had predicted with the increasing CO2 levels, and humans were affected by an unexpected increasing percentage of CO2, replacing oxygen, they both had made a high school pact.  They had both promised that they, together, would find a way to save humans and the earth.  When they both went separate ways to different graduate schools, they still kept in touch and kept their pact.  Janis had gotten her Ph.D. in Human Evolution Advancement Science and Magellan, a more traditional law degree. “They were scheduled to be terminated this afternoon,” Janis said looking down at her monitor as she scanned for ID information. 	“It is sad to think of these human subjects.  All without histories, but all wanting futures,” Magellan remarked. 	“Who would have thought that we would actually carry out our pact, and both end up in the one project that might save humans?” Janis said, “It’s just too bad that we find out that to get the job done, sacrifices have to be made, like our own ethics.  I don’t like using human subjects, but there is no other way to test human genes and expression of genes, except actually inserting them in humans.” 	“A future in the Everglades is not much of one,” Janis continued still not looking up, “but if they make their way to the Everglades, they can live freely for whatever time their destinies have allotted for them, and then they terminate.”  No harm done, I suppose,” Magellan reflects, while watching Janis’s reaction.  She doesn’t react, but somehow he knows she has something to do with the escapes.  He has known her too long.  He remembered she couldn’t even kill a cricket in high school. 	“Their lives have not been in vain, if they can help to save humanity with the genetic work that you are doing, Janis,” Magellan said half-in comfort to Janis, half to console himself, “to develop the genes to help humanity cope with the high CO2 levels and lower oxygen levels, then they have done a tremendous service.” 	“Do you want to hike Mt. Ranier later this week?” Janis wanted to change the subject. 	“Sure, let’s do it,” Magellan added, “why don’t we invite Ali51 to join us, make her feel welcome her first week at Progenitor.” 	“Sure,” Janis deadpanned, wondering why the Director had hired this new scientist for her lab without her knowing?

t5_2qm4e,idpeeinherbutt,1319779209,"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1369125/  &gt;The late medical journalist Lynn Payer addressed the issue in the early 1990s in her book Disease-Mongers: How Doctors, Drug Companies, and Insurers Are Making You Feel Sick. She wrote: “Disease-mongering—trying to convince essentially well people that they are sick, or slightly sick people that they are very ill—is big business.... Disease mongering is the most insidious of the various forms that medical advertising, so-called medical education, and information and medical diagnosis can take.” Similarly, Arthur Caplan, Professor of Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, USA, last December told the popular American TV programme 60 Minutes, “If you want to stir up worry in the public, and you've got the advertising dollars to do it, you can turn almost anything into a disease.” The focus of the 60 Minutes report was the recent emergence of a market for adult attention deficit disorder (ADD)—the traditional view was that ADD afflicted only children who would eventually outgrow it.  ...  &gt;One such example is Strattera® (atomoxetine hydrochloride), developed by Eli Lilly &amp; Co. (Indianapolis, IN, USA) and approved in November 2002 by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating ADD in children, teens and, for the first time, adults. One Lilly advertisement shows a series of photographs of an uptight-looking model, and asks in the headline: “Distracted? Disorganized? Frustrated? Modern Life or Adult ADD?” The advertisement notes that adult ADD can go undiagnosed because “its symptoms are often mistaken for a stressful life.” The commercial suggests that readers get checked out by their physician, because Strattera®, the first approved medication for adult ADD, can help “you stay focused, so you can get things done at work and at home.”",®

t5_2qh9z,eugenidesxoxo,1319782648,"(A long post coming, but titles like this one really bug me.)  This is one isolated case, and it is important to remember that, as with all medications and vaccines, that there can be negative side effects that are generally outweighed by the vast benefits for the general population. In the case of Guardasil, from the CDC website: ""As of September 15, 2011, approximately 40 million doses of Gardasil® were distributed in the U.S. and VAERS received a total of 20,096 reports of adverse events following Gardasil® vaccination."" Of the 20,000 out of 40,000,000 with some form of adverse event, 92% were considered not serious (dizziness, soreness at injection site, etc.) 8% of the adverse effects were considered serious, such as Guillain-Barre Syndrome, blood clots, and death.  Based on what the girl in the video said, I believe she had symptoms indicative of Guillain-Barre, a neurological condition that causes muscle weakness among other things. It's a sucky conditon to have no doubt, and I'm not arguing that there was not a cause/effect relationship with the vaccine. However, the probability of getting this as a result of the vaccine is miniscule. In the normal population,G-B occurs in 1-2 people out of 100,00 in their teens, and ""there has been no indication that Gardasil®increases the rate of GBS above the rate expected in the general population, whether or not they were vaccinated.""  So in conclusion, the vaccine does a lot of good, and although there will be stories like this girl's circulating, just remember that IT IS NOT THE NORM, and the chance of it happening to you is teeny-tiny.  And all my quotes are from the CDC website - http://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/vaccines/hpv/gardasil.html.",®

t5_2qm4e,visutton,1319869185,"Venusian at Heart by Victoria Sutton ©2011 Chapter 2 Georgian50, the director of the Progenitor Atmosphere Gene Project, walks into Janis’s laboratory just like he has done every other day for the last year, but today, he is not alone. “Janis, I would like to introduce to you, Ali51,” Georgian says politely. “She is going to work on the replication of the CO2 gene and see if we can’t get it into life trials, before the end of the year,” he said proudly, as if he had just found a gold nugget in a pile of dirt. “So very nice to meet you,” Janis walks toward Ali greeting her with a polite palm touch, palm facing upward.  Ali responds by placing her outstretched hand palm-to-palm with Janis, then both pulled back after a respectable few of seconds.  You could always tell a lot about a person by their handtouch, but Janis couldn’t read anything into Ali’s handtouch.   The old-fashioned handshake of the 19th Century before we knew that most bacteria and viruses were passed that way, was a lot more interesting and you could tell a lot more about a person by the grip of that greeting.  But that was long gone, and Janis had only read text about it. “I will leave you to introduce Ali to the rest of the project crew,” Georgian said and turned to leave, closing the door behind him.  She could see that he glanced back through the glass door at her, and she pretended not to notice.  Georgian was up to something, but she wasn’t sure what. Magellan walked into the laboratory, passing Georgian in the hallway, and entered the laboratory. “Magellan24,” Janis said as she saw him enter her laboratory, “Ali51.”  They met for a brief handtouch. “Ali will be working with us on the project to get the replication perfected.  Georgian has his hopes on getting this project to life trials before the end of the year.” “Optimism is important as a project leader,” Magellan says as he smiles at Ali.  It is clear her stunning beauty did not escape him. “Would you like to take a look at what we are working with?” Janis said as she directed Ali’s attention to the lab work space. “Absolutely,” Ali said, “I can’t wait to get started.” Janis takes Ali to a screen that is the wall of the room, and points to the animated replication of the chromosome with the gene they have isolated. “What does the gene do for your project?” Ali asked. “Simple.  It is taken from a plant that processes CO2 so that humans can break down the increased levels of CO2 in the atmosphere into CO2  for breathing and for metabolic functions.” Both Ali and Janis look at the unwinding, unzipping and replication of the gene on the wallscreen.   “Let’s look at a magnification of the gene and see the nucleotide base pairs,” Ali said. Janis motions the magnification sector of the wall screen and the gene’s intricate nucleotides appear on the screen. “Can you run that through the genelibrary so that we can see its matches?” “Oh, there really is no need for that.  We are long past that.  It is a gene that matches with the plant, a rare orchid at high elevation which efficiently processes CO2.” “Well, just humor me,” Ali says and smiles. Janis is starting to dislike Ali. The close-up of the nucleotides sort into A,T,C,G code and the whirl of matching at quantum speed flashes and the screen blinks. NO MATCH. “Something must be wrong,” Janis said, “they may be updating the library.  It is the orchid gene, I assure you.” “Look at the near matches,” Ali is peering at the code on the wallscreen and points with her long manicured hand using two fingers at the screen. “Several base pairs off,” Janis mumbled as she looked at the closest matches. “Was this gene engineered from one of these?” Ali asked. “No.  It is the orchid gene perfected by millions of years of evolution,” Janis said with a tone of conclusivity. “This kind of mutation would be rare indeed,” Ali said looking at Janis with piercing blue eyes. “Let’s move on to the replication bioprocessing unit,” Janis said with some disappointment in being unable to demonstrate that she was right. “We will come back to this, later?” Ali inquired. “Yes, of course,” Janis said, hoping that they never would. ******************   ",©

t5_2cneq,0rangePod,1319905686,"I think part of what's happening is that that local elected officials don't wan't to raise local taxes; not property taxes, not sales taxes, not ANY taxes. It would keep them from being reelected. So instead of raising taxes, they go to the federal government for funding.   Should federal funding be used to pay for local law enforcement? And before you answer, consider what's going on in California: FEDERAL law enforcement is raiding Medical Marijuana dispensaries, while LOCAL law enforcement leave them alone.   Federal funding for law enforcement allows the federal government to call the shots on local laws: ""If you don't follow FEDERAL drug policies, you won't get funding."" Don't believe it? Look at the legal drinking age. It used to be something that varied from state to state. And then, congress threatened to end federal highway funding for states that didn't toe the line with a drinking age of 21. Same thing with blood alcohol level; although research shows that the number of drunk-driving fatalities was not effected, congress threatened loss of federal highway funding unless states dropped the legal limit from .011 to .008.   Law enforcement should be funded on a local level. Let each state, let each city decide where they stand on the War on Drugs®. Make LOCAL government fund law enforcement, even if means raising LOCAL taxes. ",®

Is Marijuana Medicine?  The potential medicinal properties of marijuana have been the subject of substantive research and heated debate. Scientists have confirmed that the cannabis plant contains active ingredients with therapeutic potential for relieving pain, controlling nausea, stimulating appetite, and decreasing ocular pressure. Cannabinoid-based medications include synthetic compounds, such as dronabinol (Marinol®) and nabilone (Cesamet®), which are FDA approved, and a new, chemically pure mixture of plant-derived THC and cannabidiol called Sativex®, formulated as a mouth spray and approved in Canada and parts of Europe for the relief of cancer-associated pain and spasticity and neuropathic pain in multiple sclerosis.  Scientists continue to investigate the medicinal properties of THC and other cannabinoids to better evaluate and harness their ability to help patients suffering from a broad range of conditions, while avoiding the adverse effects of smoked marijuana.

Each cap usually contains 300 mgs of omega 3 fatty acids. Which is the equivalent to one portion of cod. (A portion of salmon contains 1.5g).   The importance of improving your omega 3 to 6 ratio is that omega 6 fatty acids a re precursors to arachadonic acid based inflammatory signal messengers where as omega 3 fatty acids are precursors of much less potent inflammatory and anti inflammatory signals messengers.  By keeping the intake ratio as close to 1 to 1 as possible, a persons chronic inflationary is decreased and has a subsequent decrease in inflammatory related chronic diseases including atherosclerosis etc.    look up this article: Fatty acids from fish: the anti-inflammatory potential of long-chain omega-3 fatty acids Rebecca Wall, R Paul Ross, Gerald F Fitzgerald, and Catherine Stanton Nutrition Reviews® Vol. 68(5):280–289  Regarding supplementation, the recommendation for the average person (not taking into consideration comorbidities or current medications...  drug interactions etc... ) is the following:  Multivitamin ( eg.

After hamburger is cooked, drain the fat off as needed (if there is not too much fat you can use paper towels to do this). Browning the hamburger will add more flavors.  3-4 Carrots, Peeled and Sliced 3-4 Stalks of Celery 3-4 Potatoes cut in small cubes Water as needed (just enough to cover)  Either start the carrots, celery and potatoes cooking in water in a separate pan (this speeds up the process) or once the hamburger and onion has cooked together add all of the above into the hamburger pan and cook until the vegetables are cooked.  Add:  1 can Green Beans (fresh is better if available, frozen can also be used) 1 can Corn (frozen can also be used) 1 large can Tomato Sauce (reserve about ¼ cup to mix flour or cornstarch in to Thicken soup with later) 1 heaping teaspoon Curry to taste (I prefer regular but hot curry can also be used) Beef Broth granules or cubes to taste (start slow and add more later if needed, 1 Cube or 1 teaspoon is usually for every 8 ounces or 1 cup of water used)  Mix either flour or cornstarch (about ¼-1/3 Cup) into the rest of the tomato sauce (if you have saved it) or a small amount of cold water and add to the soup once everything has been cooked and added. Bring soup to a boil for at least one minute so the flour/ cornstarch will thicken the soup and cook. Add more if it needs to be thicker.  TIPS: ♦ The curry and beef broth can be added to the vegetables when they are cooking in the water above at any point. ♦ If you add the corn, green beans and tomato sauce before the fresh vegetables are cooked they will just take longer to cook. ♦ If fresh green beans are used they should be cooked with the other fresh vegetables. ♦ If canned green beans are used take a knife and cut up the beans while they are still in the can into smaller pieces. ♦ This will make a lot of soup; you can adjust the amounts above to make less. ♦ You can also make the same basic soup with or without the curry and with lentils and/or beans instead of the hamburger. You can buy different types of beans or buy a bean mix. ♦ If you do it with lentils they cook quickly so you can just cook them with the fresh vegetables (include onion). ♦ If you do it with dried beans, rinse the beans carefully (sometimes stones get in there) and boil them in enough water to cover plus about 1 inch for 1 minute.

Thicken the soup as desired with the milk/flour or cornstarch mix above. Cook several minutes to thicken the soup and cook the starch but its better if this type of soup doesn’t boil because of the milk products.

t5_2qm4e,visutton,1320037915,"Venusian at Heart, Victoria Sutton © 2011 Chapter 3  	Magellan  watches Ali as she walks down the hallway from his office door, leaning into the doorway in a deplorable fashion, Janis thought.  Magellan was a handsome 35, and his dark hair and eyes would make anyone wonder how he had stayed unattached from a mate for so long.  But Janis knew about his short-lived marriage, which ended in acrimony, leaving Magellan distrustful of women.  Janis even felt he distrusted her sometimes and she was a long time friend. Janis shook her head and returned to her research, but something just didn’t feel right to Janis. 	“Janis,” Ali walked back in to their laboratory space, “that was truly tragic with the human subject escape, wasn’t it?” 	Janis felt the muscles in her lower back suddenly tighten, “Yes, tragic.  They were scheduled for extermination this afternoon.”  Janis didn’t look up. 	“It must be a lot of pressure on you, being responsible for the research subjects and to have them escape under your watch,” Ali said as she kept her eyes on Janis, “being among the EvoHums gives you some advantage, doesn’t it, Janis?”   Not only did Janis feel she was probing too much, but now she was throwing up her class status like she had some special privilege to make mistakes.  That was not true.  The EvoHums who had been genetically designed to accelerate human evolution to withstand the changing atmosphere certainly were the hope of earth, but it also placed high expectations on its members. 	“Sometimes things happen, and even the best plans can’t prevent mishaps,” Janis said, trying to contain her anger toward Ali.  Who was she to come into her laboratory and make such remarks?  Janis assumed that Ali was a member of the EvoHums to be hired to work in her laboratory, but it was not at all clear. 	“I heard that this is not the first time that there has been a big escape,” Ali pressed her, “some people think it is an inside job.” 	“I really doubt it,” Janis said, now thoroughly annoyed and concerned that Ali was pressing her a little too hard. 	“Are you ready to give us an update on your plan to increase the replication speed?” Janis tried to shift the focus back on Ali and her work. 	“Yes, I am anxious to show everyone on the project my plan,” Ali said, as she whirled around on her heels and went to her space.   	Janis thought that the annoying part was that Ali didn’t even try to look good.  Her long blonde hair flowed, and her legs were longer than anyone should rightfully have, Janis thought.  Ali was just a natural beauty and making no effort just didn’t seem fair to Janis. *****************   	The weekend had been much too short, Janis thought. She had ridden the bullet train to Shanghai from New York for the weekend, and walked the open walkway of the Yangtze River with her SCAU, looking for the gold fish monsters that they had genetically synthesized to survive in the polluted waters.  They were surviving just fine, and they had become quite a tourist attraction for a number of years, but were just a passing fascination on the riverwalk.   Janis wished that her friend, Magellan would be more than a friend and then he would be here with her, walking along the Yangtze, talking about their lives together. Instead, Janis had Monday morning with Magellan.  Janis and Magellan carpooled together in the mornings, since they lived in the same community quad.  Well, at least they were friends.   “This temperature makes driving more stressful than it should be,” Magellan remarked as he focused on the traffic around them. “It’s 117 degrees Fahrenheit, and it is going to be around 121 later, so we shouldn’t have to worry about the battery stalling,” Janis said. Magellan and Janis swung into the parking garage and into the solar collector space to which he was entitled because they carpooled.  Keeping their self-contained atmospheric suits on or as it was also called, SCOU the ancient moniker that had stuck, they moved into the laboratory quad.  Once inside, they were able to climb out of their SCOU apparatus in the atmospheric-controlled laboratory.  It had just the right about of oxygen for humans, with only slightly elevated CO2 levels.  They were in Generation 5X, the fifth level of increased CO2 human evolution enhancement which meant they had an inserted gene for CO2 tolerance of 5X the ambient level of 2000.  This was not keeping up with the increasing CO2 percentage of the atmosphere, but it allowed them the ability to function for short periods in the earth’s atmosphere, where their parents, Generation 4X and grandparents, Generation 3X could not.      “The gene that we have isolated and we have been inserting at conception, is one that has a very interesting pedigree,” Janis said to Magellan. 	“You mean, the part about it being from a secret data base that Ali was using?” Magellan responded. 	“Yes, that’s exactly what I mean,” Janis said, “she is acting very strange, and she should not have been accessing that database, yet Georgian said to let her do whatever she wanted to do.  Something is very strange about that, too.  Maybe you should just be cautious, Magellan.” 	“Don’t be absurd.  Do you think you might be a little jealous?” Magellan taunted Janis like he knew that he could.  They were friends. Janis ignored him, but then her face lit up. “Let’s see if we can find the classified database she used and identify the origin of this gene,” Janis said as Magellan followed her into the laboratory. Janis waves the wallscreen on, and looks into the history of Ali’s search.   “There it is,” Janis said, “it is a classified database stored on Satellite 3A, a fairly new one, and out of the clouds enough to avoid hacking.” “So what.  What’s the data base?” Magellan said. “The name of the location where the bacteria is found is here.  It is small, hard to see --- looks like, Maxwell Montes,”  Janis said, as she entered the name into a cloudsearch device. “If that’s a place, I have never heard of it.  It must be part of a mountain range – montes, means ‘mountain’ in Spanish?” “Maxwell Montes,” Janis reads from her cloudsearch, “is a mountain in the Range of mountains, approximately seven miles high, it is the highest point in the mountain range, which is covered with a layer of pyrite.” “But where is this mountain range? I have never heard of it.” “I don’t know, the screen seems to be overlapping with another one,” Janis fumbles with the cloudsearch device, going back and forth between her screens, dissolving in and out. “It is on Venus,” Janis says in a whisper looking up from her search, stunned by her discovery. ",©
t5_2qm4e,visutton,1320040066,"continuation of Chapter 3  Venusian at Heart, Victoria Sutton © 2011  “That’s impossible.  There is no life on Venus,” Magellan smiles with disbelief. “No, I am certain, it is a mountain range on Venus, and Venus is well defined for having a layer of pyrite everywhere,” Janis continued. Ali appeared wearing her usual black dress. “Ali,” Magellan turned to greet her as she entered the laboratory space, “come look at this information about the gene.  We found your database and the origin of the gene.  Did you know that the note says it is from Venus?  It is from the most extreme elevation on Venus on Montes Maxwell.” Ali looked stoic, then looked away.  Janis knew she had hit something with Ali but it was not clear exactly what that might be.   	“Let’s take a look at a topography,” Janis persisted.  Janis turned toward the wallscreen and swept her hand from left to right to open the wallscreen, opening the map. 	“That’s a topography of earth,” Magellan said, proudly.  Since he was a lawyer and not a scientist he enjoyed the occasional moment when he could point out things to the scientists that maybe they had missed. 	“Yes, we last had a look at some of the extreme environments on earth, scanning for extremophiles and genes we might be able to use,” Janis remarked, as she spread out the earth in front of her.  The wall screen flashed on the Asian region of earth. 	“Look, that’s the Mariana Trench!” Magellan was on a roll now, and couldn’t resist pointing out every feature he saw.  He was obviously trying to impress Ali with his knowledge and insights. 	“Yes, Magellan, that’s the Mariana Trench, 7 miles deep and considered to be the place where life began,” Janis patronizingly said, “and a place where we go to find extremophiles that haven’t already been harvested that could be useful for human insertion.” 	“Ali,” Janis asked, “do you know where the Montes Maxwell is located on Venus?” 	“Of course,” Ali said without hesitation, “ right here.”  She waved the wallscreen toward a focus on the topography of Venus, and a beautiful  mountain range, crescent-shaped from the sky, showed a high peak, which she identified as Montes Maxwell. 	Janis glanced at Magellan to gauge his reaction, and he was mightily impressed and not the least bit suspicious of why she knew so readily where to find the mountain on Venus.  One learns a lot about the planets in training but not typically every geographic feature.  All the blood had drained from his brain into other parts of his body, Janis thought.   This was just impossible, Janis thought.  Life doesn’t exist on Venus.  It is too hot, it is too dry and the atmosphere is mostly CO2.  Yes, it sounds good, and bacteria that could utilize CO2 would be perfect, but it doesn’t mean that bacteria exist there.   	“Ali,” Janis continued, “did this gene come from this mountain on Venus?” 	“That’s what the database says,” Ali said, not offering further insight. 	“Do you remember learning about Pangea, the beginning of earth’s continents when the one large land mass, Pangea broke apart and the continents drifted across the earth?” Ali asked. 	“Of course, I remember.  Every school child has learned that by age 3,” Janis remarked coldly.   Her impatience was beginning to show. 	“In fact, it was so obvious, the scientists missed it for years, until a school child pointed out that the continents all fit together like pieces of a puzzle into one big land mass, isn’t that right, Janis?”  Ali persisted. 	“Yes, what are you getting at?” Janis was now at her wits end with Ali. 	“Wait, I think I see it!” Magellan spoke up, interrupting the rhythm of the two women. 	Magellan rose from his seat and walked toward the wallscreen, waving his arm to shift the scene back to the earth view of the Mariana Trench. 	“Look at the shape of the Mariana Trench!  It is a crescent-shape and 7 miles deep, the deepest spot on the planet,”  Magellan then waives his arm to shift the wall screen to the topography of Venus. 	“Now look at Montes Maxwell.  In a crescent-shaped mountain range, 7 miles in elevation, one of the highest points on the planet, Venus!  Now look as I superimpose earth over Venus and the Mariana Trench over Montes Maxwell.  It is a three-dimensional puzzle that fits together, just like Pangea was a two-dimensional puzzle.  Venus was once a part of earth, and this is where they were joined before Venus broke away and entered its own orbit!”  Magellan was in awe of his own observation, and didn’t notice that Janis was shaking her head in disbelief, while Venus had folded her arms across her chest and had just a hint of a smile that might have even been considered smug. 	“Even if this three-dimensional Pangea theory is correct, it doesn’t mean that life developed on Venus like it did on earth,” Janis pointed out. 	“No, but what if life began before Venus broke off into its own orbit?” Ali asked. 	“No way it could have survived,” Janis was quick with you reply. 	“But why not?” Magellan asked.

t5_2qm4e,visutton,1320085057,"Chapter 4 Venusian at Heart by Victoria Sutton © 2011  “Yes, but do you believe that the CO2 gene is from Venus?”  Janis asked incredulously. 	“Well, why not?  Pyrite is where the first DNA arose, and that is where life began.  Venus is covered with pyrite, making it the perfect substrate for the spark needed to start to attach the nucleotides creating a DNA spine, right?”  Ali looked at Janis and then Magellan, and both returned her look with a look of disbelief, even Magellan. 	“The origins of DNA are likely from the hydrothermal vents at the bottom of the deepest parts of the ocean, like those in the Mariana Trench,” Janis said, “and the pyrite theory is just that, a theory.” 	“So is the hydrothermal vent theory, a theory,” Ali remarked, “why couldn’t both theories be correct?” 	“So both theories of the beginning of life are correct,” Janis is thinking out loud pretending to ignore Ali, “the hydrothermal vents were once next to the pyrite surface, and together they both gave rise to DNA.” 	“Yes, I think an explanation would go something like that,” Ali added. 	“Where are those biotech protesters from the last century when you need them?’ Magellan quipped, “If they only knew that inserting genes from other species into their vegetables was only the tip of the iceberg lettuce.” 	“Engineering not just cross species but interplanetary species was never contemplated by the bioethicists, and it is increasingly clear that no one wanted this secret discovery to leak,” Janis thought outloud. 	“Alien DNA is inserted in practically every child conceived in the world, since 2050,” Ali said matter-of-factly. 	“How much alien DNA does it take to make an illegal alien?” Magellan quipped. 	“It’s not a legal question, Magellan, it’s a serious bioethical question!” Janis protested Magellan’s levity. 	“It doesn’t seem to have harmed anyone,” Magellan said. 	“It has done exactly what it was intended to do, advance human evolution to cope with the rapidly rising CO2 composition of the air we breathe,” and if we were in another age, we would be wiped out like an Ice Age, but we aren’t.” 	“Even if we become something else,” Janis reflects on this discovery with some growing angst. ********************  Janis and Magellan were playing a game of Biochess, and when Janis captured Magellan’s knight with her pawn, it made a squeaking noise like its genes had programmed to do.   “Well, at least my castle didn’t squirt you!” Janis said gleefully, know the seasquirt gene was a special favorite of Magellan’s used to make the players think of water in a moat around a castle when it was captured in Biochess. “I am not jealous,” Janis protested, “I am just saying you should be skeptical about her motivations.  Her hiring, her protection by Georgian and her behavior outside of laboratory protocol are all troublesome and as far as I am concerned, they need an explanation before I feel comfortable that she is on our team.” “What do you mean?” Magellan retorted, “she has not done anything but help with the gene replication project, and has made great strides I might add.  Her finding that the gene originated from Venus is pretty spectacular.  No wonder it was classified.” “Exactly.  How did she even know to access that classified database if she didn’t already know something about it.”  Janis captured Magellan’s Queen, with a pawn which let out its squeak. “I don’t know, but I do know that we are going to hike Mt. Ranier this weekend,” Magellan smiled a devilish smile. “We were going to hike Mt. Ranier this weekend!” Janis couldn’t help but reply with some shock and disappointment in her friend.  After all, they had been hiking buddies for a couple of years, and sure there was something between them, but nothing romantic.  Just solid friendship, and maybe Janis thought about going further with their relationship but it just didn’t seem to click with Magellan. “Oh, gosh, sorry Janis,” Magellan looked slightly sorry, “I forgot that we had plans to hike this weekend.  So let’s take a rain check?” “Checkmate,” Janis swallowed her disappointment, and her pawn squeaked. *****************  By afternoon, Magellan and Ali have still not returned from their long lunch at the other end of the quad, and Janis is getting concerned.  Maybe she is a little jealous she surmises, but more importantly, Magellan is not thinking with his brain, and she is probably not good for him. 	Ali and Magellan stroll into the laboratory, and Janis looks up to see them go off to their offices with a lingering extended arm touch, before the goodbye.  It is clear that this has been a productive lunch for Magellan. 	“Oh, Magellan,” Janis calls out to him, and he turns around at the sound of his name, “do you have a minute?” “No, I am late getting back from lunch, so I have to run.  How about later?” Magellan says as he walks backward as he is talking to Janis. 	“Yeah, later is fine,” Janis says with a sigh.  Yes, it is clear that Magellan is not thinking with his brain. 	An hour rolls by, and Magellan appears in the laboratory space doorway, clearly looking for Ali. 	“She’s out, Magellan,” Janis says without prompting, “she’s in the conception room for the next hour or so.” 	“Who?” Magellan asks innocently. 	“So do you have a minute now?” Janis ignores his feigned ignorance of his purpose in lurking in the doorway. 	“So what’s going on with you and Ali?” Janis asks. 	“Oh nothing, other than we are planning our hike to Mt. Ranier.” 	“So where are you going on Mt. Ranier?” 	“Ali wants to go to the very top of the volcano crater’s edge,” Magellan said. 	“That sounds dangerous enough,” Janis continued, “ it is time for Mt. Ranier to explode again, you know.” 	“Really?  Of course I know that!  She thought it would be exciting to do something a little dangerous on our first outing, and I thought that sounded intriguing.” 	“She certainly likes to live life dangerously.” 	“Well it is no surprise.  And she told me that she could never marry or plan a future with me,” Magellan reflected. 	“What do you mean?” 	“She told me in confidence that she has a terminator gene, inserted at conception, because of some paperwork screw-up at the conception center,” Magellan said. 	“Did you ask her if she sued them?” 	“No, I was just sad to hear that she knew she would die so young,” Magellan concluded. 	“You are a lawyer, and you had no interest in this insane malpractice case?” Janis asked with astonishment. 	“To be honest with you, talking about a malpractice case was the furthest thing from my mind,” Magellan said, “I felt so deeply sorry for her, knowing that she had only a short time to live and she knows it.  But she seems to be making the best of her time by having as much fun as possible!” 	“Yeah, it sounds like it, and I am sure you won’t take advantage of that?” Janis asked with a sly smile. 	“Janis, you know me better than that.  I am a gentleman to the core, and feel only the need to protect her, now.” 	“I am sure that is exactly what she wanted.” 	“Janis, I am in complete control, and don’t think otherwise.” ",©

By writing on reddit you are collaborating with the enemy!  But seriously, to say that ""Corporate America"" is to blame is a joke, everything you own is the product of a corporation. What you should be complaining against is the people who **break the law** with the aims of making money. One is criminal, the other is semantics. If you want to sound like an intelligent person you should actually pinpoint the problem as opposed to waving your dick around saying that ""Corporate America"" is to blame. ",©
