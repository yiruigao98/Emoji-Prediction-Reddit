TLDR; compression shirts are worth the money.    layers are great, if you're going to use makeup for facial hair, make sure it's a close shade to your hair (though maybe just a bit darker).   **last, but probably the most important:** carry yourself with confidence.  head tilted up a bit, shoulders back, don't slouch and long, sure strides.  have fun and be safe !  ♥ (:",♥

t5_6,flip69,1293939123,"&gt;Yes that's correct but the when he was breaking the rules people did not think of him as a good artist.  No, people didn't think his work was of value at the time. [The Salon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salon_%28Paris%29) may have allowed him to exhibit at the secondary show.    But not at the main one, that was reserved for traditional mainstream works (because they had formalized and codified ""art"" thereby halting any progression outside of their official rulebook) for receiving a stamp of approval. Anyway... we won't ever know because (I can't remember if he) never submitted anything to them before his death.   What we do know is that the common people around him didn't see his work as genius. But they still kept his paintings on their walls until VG works were seen as being extra-valuable.  &gt;Anyone can be an artist even if they are crappy artist, their still artist.  Then the word is without meaning, if it can apply to anyone. I think that this has much to do with the poor education of the public and devaluing of ""art"". sorry but this doesn't work for me.  It's like saying that I'm an engineer or a pharmacist because I play with legos™ or because I gave my friend an aspirin.  We know it's not true because there are things that one has to show, a demonstrable ability and knowledge of in order to receive such a title. Just saying so, doesn't make reality. I don't see where this justifies calling the pencil sketch ""art"". it's not. it's an illustration at best... even a first year art student should call this simply ""an image"" and nothing else.

Keep in mind that for some reason, you can still find these same drugs for sale in Mexico and Canada for **MUCH** cheaper prices, yet the manufacturers still sell them there. It's almost like the profit margins they get there are actually perfectly acceptable, they're just milking the American consumer for **FAR** more than that simply because they can. Damn, I should start supporting them more.  &gt;ill take the drug companies any day to assholes breaking down my door with ak-47's and wiping out all my friends.

Those damn respectful people ruining the world.  &gt;people are different. races are different. cultures are different.  Yup, they are. That's why I actually try to know something about the people, the races, and the cultures instead of doing something foolish like lumping them all together with a racist statement like implying that an entire race is simply more violent than another entire race.

Part 3: In the Spotlight: Articles of Special Interest Part 4: Featured Columns Part 5: Sharing and Forwarding Tools Part 6: Other Intelligence Part 7: TNNWC Suite of Services Part 8: TNNWC Selected Service Providers    A Note From the Founder...    Attracting Money in 2011  by Adam J. Kovitz   A new year is upon us and with it, a new hope for continued success with our emerging enterprises. Depending upon who you read, the outlook is positive for job growth, and therefore, economic growth this year. For us entrepreneurs, we have to do our parts as well to spur on a sluggish economy - after all, at the heart of a healthy economy are fruitful enterprises who can provide jobs and increased profit.  Of course, to make money, we have to have money. But unless we have lots of wealthy friends or family members who want to bank roll us or a sizable 401K we can ""dip into"", we have to find it wherever we can. And while banks may be starting to lend more and other corporate wallets are starting to loosen up, we have to properly prepare ourselves to look our best for potential investors.  So what are investors looking for?  Here's a hint: They are looking for the same things they always look for, aside from being in a hot market at the right time or just having a great idea:  Demonstrated revenues: Nothing attracts money like money, and if you're showing a regular monthly revenue stream and can demonstrate what that stream would look like with a healthy infusion of capital, you have yourself a winning combination.  Being frugal: Investors love a healthy looking company or website that looks like a million dollars, even if you paid next to nothing and are holding it together with duct tape. Minding your expenses shows others not only that you appreciate the value of money but that you're resourceful (innovative and/or influential) as well.  Knowing your s&amp;%t: Having demonstrated knowledge in a field (for example: starting an online company when the founders have direct experience in web development, architecture and design) puts investors at ease that you're not reinventing yourself because you couldn't find a job and are passing the experience off as an ""entrepreneurial startup"".  Demonstrating a clear return on investment: Too many CEO wannabees confuse crowdfunding with investment. Yes...startups can get initial funding from friends, family and their immediate network by showing your company as a cause, but bigger investment sources don't care about anything but the bottom line. By showing investors their ROI (i.e., how much money do I get back, when do I get it back and how do you know?) you're on the road to entrepreneurial heaven.  Having a winning team: Sometimes having a great idea is just not enough, and often being the idea person does not necessarily qualify one to run a company, let alone manage a team. Not good with finance, programming or marketing? Sure you can learn on the job, but why do that when you can find real professionals with real experience to provide the rocket fuel to take your company to the stars.   So, in 2011, make it your business to position your emerging enterprise for capital. Take the steps now to be an attractive force for investors - the world is counting on you.

t5_2qmjp,michaelochurch,1294158336,"&gt; As for competitive play, that's a tough one. It is really hard to have a free-for-all game be truly good for competitive play, though possible (e.g. Poker).  Yes. Poker is person-against-crowd. Bridge is team-against-team. Chess and Go are head-to-head. Ambition is in a weird spot, being a 4-player each-for-himself game where a weak player can make it a *lot* more volatile. Good players realize that Nil is a weak strategy (it's for making low hands playable, but it only gives a mediocre round and it enables Slam) tend to go for it about 15% of the time whereas weak players are closer to 30-35%. Table position matters more in Ambition than in other trick games, and being at right of a ""Nil-aholic"" sucks; he never leads and so you're never in 4th position.   Tournament Ambition is much more person-against-crowd, because the tables are randomly assigned and table compositions and seating positions change each round. (This is done in a way so that no player is more than one round short of any player.) You're unlikely to play at the exact same table twice and, if there is a weak player, you're not at his left (or right) every hand.   Poker has a *severe* collusion problem in cash games. In the bad old days, people were killed over it, and it's still illegal (I believe) in California to play at a cash game with a sibling or spouse. This is a lot less pronounced in tournaments, where people are focused on individually winning and it's impossible to transfer chips. Also, two people who might want to collude are unlikely to end up at the same table.   For collusion in Ambition, it hasn't been a problem in the 6- to 9-person beer-and-pizza tournaments I've hosted. If the game develops an ""official"" tournament culture, there will be a need to discuss what is appropriate table talk and what's not. Although it would be a *great* problem to have, I don't look forward to having to make those decisions, since they could make the game stuffy. For example, in some Bridge tournaments, you're not allowed to talk during games *at all*. (You use cards or voice-boxes in bidding, to prevent tone-of-voice information from breaking through.)  I did fuck up once with regard to collusion. I was playing with my girlfriend and teaching 2 new players. Because they were new, and because I'd rather a close game than a trouncing, I was giving them strategic pointers as we played. One dropped the K♣ (17-point whopper) on my girlfriend to ""punish"" her with a 30+ point trick. I told her not to do this; that ""pwning"" people in this was was bad strategy. It ruined my girlfriend's Slam and it took her months to forgive me for that. I don't blame her; I was just trying to give advice but it was a shitty time to do it. I really should have let her Slam and then told the newbie why it happened after the fact.   For the record, I prefer to teach 4 new players (and sit out) over playing with 2 or 3 newbies, but I take what I can get. One new player at the table is fine, but at 2 or 3, I either trounce them (which is no fun) or I get frustrated by the volatility that their ineptitude puts into the game. Watching 4 brand-new players is fun, though. Early in the game's evolution, that made me aware of some strategies I'd never seen before.",♣
t5_2qlqh,VincentLaguardiaGa,1294161576,"I would advise you to research the NEON extended instruction set that is used on the Hummingbird and not available on the Snapdragon. Then return to admit that your entire argument is wrong.  Nevermind...I'll save you the trouble:  *** __CPU__  *NEON technology is a __128 bit SIMD__ (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) architecture extension for the ARM Cortex™-A series processors, designed to provide flexible and powerful acceleration for consumer multimedia applications, delivering a significantly enhanced user experience.*  [source](http://www.arm.com/products/processors/technologies/neon.php)  Hummingbird has it, Snapdragon does not. NEON instruction set optimizations were added in the 2.2 release of Android, which is why people with Galaxy S devices have seen such a dramatic speed improvement, when updating to a 2.2 ROM.  *ARM Advanced SIMD (a.k.a. NEON) instruction support - The NEON instruction set extension can be used to perform scalar computations on integers and floating points. __However, it is an optional CPU feature and will not be supported by all Android ARMv7-A based devices.__ The NDK includes a tiny library named ""cpufeatures"" that can be used by native code to test at runtime the features supported by the device's target CPU.*  [source](http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2010/05/android-22-and-developers-goodies.html)  Also, because of this extended instruction set, the Hummingbird does not use VFP instructions, therefore they need not be pipelined:  *NEON technology is cleanly architected and works seamlessly with its own independent pipeline and register file.*  The NEON instruction set, is the main reason why, the Galaxy platform was selected as the next generation developer phone and not a MT4G based device.  *** __GPU__  &gt; the hummingbird's gpu is bottlenecked by the bus speed.  The Hummingbird's bus supports a 1.6 Gbps transfer rate, capable of drawing 90 million triangles per second. This is because 128k of the 512k of the total system RAM is Samsung's [OneDRAM](http://www.samsung.com/global/business/semiconductor/products/fusionmemory/Products_OneDRAM.html). Which, and I quote, ""when OneDRAM is used in the system, memory transfer speed improves by a factor of five""  What GPU bus bottleneck are you referring to? There isn't one, the Snapdragon is not even worthy of being compared to the Hummingbird, in the realm of graphics...please stop.  *** __RAM__  Ok, it has more RAM. However, more RAM is only better if it improves performance, in this case, it does not. (see previous reference to OneDRAM)  *** All of the other stuff is basically personal preference and does not need to be addressed.  So, in conclusion, you're wrong...the Hummingbird is the best chipset available and the ""heavily modified"" Snapdragon still falls short in performance because of the absence of the NEON instruction set.  EDIT: corrected GPU transfer rate to 1.6Gbps, previously I had an incorrect 12.6GBps. Number is 1.6 and unit is ""bits"" not ""bytes"" per second.",™

I checked your posts by controversial filter and your top one (militant agnostic) is pretty funny and true... But the one about the islamic center I disagree on. If you've read the qu'ran and seen opinion polls of the views of the muslim population then you'd know that it's not just terrorists that give islam a bad reputation. If an atheist organisation had a book as hateful as the qu'ran, had as extremely intolerant views and were linked to consistent violent acts against those whose only crime was not submitting to their authority then I doubt they'd be allowed to have schools and community centers. Islam gets a free pass just because it's old and established.  And don't give me the Christianity is just as bad malarkey. When have the majority of christians supported the death penalty for homosexuals and apostates? Just look at the least peaceful countries on earth, most are islamic and of the most peaceful none are islamic. It's not a coincidence. Iran has given the death penalty to thousands of people whose only crime was being born homosexual. If the fact that 68% of muslims polled in the liberal UK want similar laws doesn't frighten you then you're quite frankly an ignorant and horrible person. In the UK muslims commit 13 times more hate crimes against homosexuals than the average population. If we don't do everything we can to peacefully retard it's progress then we are failing the future generations who will have to live in a very scary world indeed. And that is their goal, to take over the world, ""to fight until all is for Allah"". The longest serving muslim leader said europe would be taken over within 30 years.  To call the people that hate islam intolerant is ludicrous, it's a really cowardly and disgusting attitude that you must respect every view. I do not have any respect for people that want me to spend eternity being tortured. It really pisses me off that muslims can have the most extroardinarily intolerant views, they could barely be more intolerant, and yet you respect them and instead you're calling the atheists intolerant for seeing it for what it is. You are complicit with the daily torture most gay people in islamic societies face. And yet you think you're the one being more reasonable and peaceful! Tolerance of intolerance is cowardice.

I would point you to the case of Alfred Steven who shut down most VX^© modules on the east coast a few years ago in his quest for the division 3 record.

t5_2qhk3,ExpendableOne,1294205631,"&gt;""If someone follows you home, assume the best about them.""  I didn't say ""assume the best""(kind of a strawman), I said don't assume the absolute worse and don't reinforce a destructive label towards that person under that pretence. Odds are he is very likely simply someone who's walking in the same direction as you are(though there could be other possibilities besides ""creepy rapist is following me!""; what if, for example, you saw a girl that looked drunk or drugged out of her mind, would you not consider walking in the same direction to makes sure she doesn't just end up dead in a ditch).   &gt;Women do not have to assume the best about men.  Assuming a guy isn't going to rape a woman because he's looking at here, isn't really assuming the best of him, or of men, either. Again, though, what I said is that they shouldn't assume the absolute worse either(though, in this particular case, would it really even be that bad to assume the best? goodness forbid...).    &gt;You are asking women to judge men by their intentions, but people can't read minds, so instead we have to judge each other by our actions.   What actions? In this context, not only has he as taken none but you are actually judging him on completely unfounded, and harmful, misconceptions/biases. Do you really think every single threat to women will just be male or make themselves that obvious by staring in the first place? And, no, your right, a woman couldn't really read a man's mind(though, for these so called experts on non-verbal cues; you wouldn't think it would be that hard) but that doesn't mean those men aren't worth trying to figure out either.    &gt;If a woman feels threatened by someone staring at her, it's not her fault, it's his.  No, that is her reaction, based on her irrational fears and stereotypes. If I felt threatened by a woman for walking her dog or for getting into her car; would it be my fault or hers? Would you consider me justified, especially if I felt threatened in the intensity that a woman would typically for a man in this context?  &gt;""You should let me touch you, even if you don't want me to, because I have to reinforce my social position.""  That isn't even close to what I said... though, your interpretation once again reinforces this point of ""he's only creepy because he's not unattractive"". Men are getting countless mixed signals, on one hand you have women calling you a pussy if you're not forward enough(which usually ends up with the guy alone; because in all likelihood that girl would have never even made a move even if she was interested), on the other you have women calling you creepy if you're too forward(though, despite the risk of being labelled a creep; still has a significantly better chance of success).  &gt;You do not have the right to insert yourself into someone else's life, and you certainly don't have the right to do it in a physical way, just because someone out there ""expects"" it.  First of all, this isn't just ""someone out there""; its a social doctrine for a reason. Secondly, everyone insert themselves into other people lives, in physical or non-physical means, every single day; that is how people meet one another and interact. You do not have the right to control who these people interact with, or attempt to interact with; much less in a public space. Also, just because someone tries to interact with you, or ""insert themselves into your life""(which, is a repulsively narcissistic and misanthropic way to put, by the way), doesn't really mean you are perfectly vindicated in reacting in this manner either(which is both inconsiderate and, contrary to this ""creeper's"" behaviour does actual harm to someone).   &gt;People in MensRights and TwoXC complain about the same negative gender stereotypes.   Not quite, twoXC is only complains about the negative gender stereotypes that negatively affect them. The ""nice guy™"", ""creep"", ""pervert"" negative stereotypes, and many others, are still consistently up-voted there.  &gt;Instead of trying to fit in to a harmful gender role, wait and look for someone who doesn't want you to fit that role.  That is the exact opposite of what you are arguing for here. You are basically saying anyone who is, in any way, introverted, insecure or lacking social skills should be anything but themselves least they be labelled creeps; and that people, or women especially, should in no way try to refrain from using such negative stereotypes and harmful labels against them.   &gt; Do I feel comfortable when someone follows me, or stares at me, or touches my arm during a conversation, or tells me about their social/emotional problems at first meeting?   If this is how you react to these situations; you really weren't that empathetic in the first place either.  &gt;Why would I expect a girl to respond differently in the same situation?  Being uncomfortable is completely different than being justified in using a label like ""creep"" on someone. I might not feel comfortable giving my grand-parents a hug; that doesn't mean it would be right for me to label them as ""creeps"" and/or ""rapists"" when they try though.  It's also a little bit different when that negative reaction stems entirely from gender biases, sexism, double-standards and/or prejudice/disdain towards the ""unattractive"".",™

As outlined by the report, organizations must deal with nine major challenges associated with the current MDM paradigm:  1. ""The Big Bang"" - unrealistic project scope and time to complete implementation; 2. Manual processes and professional services requirement; 3. Data discovery and gaining visibility into data elements; 4. Complex planning and management; 5. Requirement to transform to MDM model; 6. Painful to achieve synchronization; 7. Cloud architecture and integrating data that does not reside in the data center; 8. Scalability is difficult; 9. Complex maintenance once project is completed.  An alternate approach, called Virtual Master Data Management™ (VMDM), addresses each of these challenges and enables organizations to improve their return on investment, reduce time to implementation and risk of project failure. VMDM brings visibility and enterprise-wide control that simplifies maintenance and enhances compliance and audit. At any level, this new paradigm provides full visibility, from one console, into the state of all aspects of transforms, metadata, metrics on data integration flow and metrics on data integration server performance.

t5_2qh61,Titan777,1294285690,"I emailed them bitching them out, and this was their reply: Hello,  Thank you for your email. Recent news articles about Susan G. Komen for the Cure® and our effort to protect our trademarks tell only part of the story. Komen for the Cure sees protecting its trademarks, e.g., “for the Cure” as responsible stewardship of the trust and dollars that our donors invest in us.     We’ve never put “mom and pop” charities out of business and don’t intend to. Instead, we seek solutions to keep these charities working while ensuring that donors know where their dollars are actually going. Often, this involves asking other charities to continue planning their event or promotion, but to consider clarifying the name of that event or promotion at a later date.     We do this because we believe strongly that our donors should have confidence that when they see “for the Cure,” it means their dollars are being used to support the research, community outreach and advocacy programs that Komen has funded since we began in 1982. This includes the grants that paid for 600,000 screenings for low-income or uninsured women last year, the 90,000 follow-up screenings, and social and financial support to 100,000 women last year.     It's clear that Komen’s work has made a difference for women and men with breast cancer. Mortality rates from breast cancer are down 31 percent in 20 years; five-year survival rates from early stage cancers are 98 percent versus 74 percent when we started, and women are benefitting from more personalized treatments for this disease.  Eighty-four cents of every dollar we raise goes to all of these programs, earning us Charity Navigator’s highest ranking four years in a row. As a result, people trust us. That’s why we protect our name.  For those envisioning legions of attorneys storming small charities to enforce trademarks, know that we monitor Patent and Trademark Office filings and reach out to the charities involved. The amount we spend to protect our donors’ interests is far below the $1 million mentioned in one news story.     We’re grateful for our millions of supporters and hope that potential donors will take the opportunity to become familiar with Komen and understand that our funding practices and strong stewardship are efforts to protect the trust they have in Susan G. Komen for the Cure.",®

I just did a couple of quick google image searches for some photos from the 20 to the 50s. Apart from party shots and euphoric family moments, there's not a lot of smiles being passed around. Advertising photos and illustrations are also devoid of grins, except occasionally on females. Prohibition and the depression were, apparently, Serious Business.  Then the photos from the late 40s come along, and things change. Once we're into the 50s, everyone is grinning. In advertising, too, smiles abound on everyone.  Now this might be too simple of a thesis, but the spread of smiles in pictures is simply no more than a product of post war American prosperity. Without sounding too cliche, it *was* a time of endless hope and possibility, and the American Dream® was within reach for many more citizens than in previous decades. I think that with some good research and a bit of sociological mumbo jumbo (as well as ignoring the cold war and whatever was going on in Europe at the time), a case could be made that it all comes down to postwar euphoria as the turning point of a collective mindset that made us want to smile in pictures.",®

t5_6,the_IRF,1294314742," TUESDAY, JANUARY 04, 2011 BLUE THING #5: Featured Company of the Week      John Hobbs and Oasis Global: A great example of “Teamwork Makes The Dream Work”  With 12 years background as the CEO for of a sporting goods company, John R Hobbs had the inspiration of a new and unique product, a balanced water bottle he now has branded as Water Waits. Realizing that the sporting goods industry is a 60 billion dollar industry he is targeting over 83 million runners and walkers (just in the continental US) with his flagship product with expectations of going global within the year. His new sporting goods company: Oasis Global, Inc.  John Hobbs  What makes his product unique is that Water Waits is a balanced 19 oz. water bottle that envelopes the hand so the runner/walker doesn’t need to hold it in the conventional manner. With one bottle in each hand the runner/walker stays evenly balanced. As the runner/walker gets thirsty he/she just hits the thumb trigger to drink from the convenient spout. Staying hydrated while running/walking is very important to one’s health.    John admits that he has had to learn some very difficult lessons as he built his business. In his first attempt to grow his company he tried to do most all of the company development by himself. In his own efforts he “crashed and burned”!  John had joined CEO Space in his early stages of progress. He learned how to build a team. He learned how to sequence his processes. He learned all the needed essentials. He even assembled all that he needed to produce his product. That didn’t stop him from believing that he could do it all himself.  When he was just starting and had limited funds he needed to do everything himself. From his background along with previous mindsets, John was positioned for a hard lesson. He couldn’t grow a successful business of the size he had envisioned by himself.  It wasn’t until he began to grow that he came to the realization that he needed to practice what he had been taught. By continuously returning to the forum he learned that he needed to clear out the old viruses, the old mindsets and develop a new approach. Once he recognized that he could no longer do it by himself he set out to build a new company structure; one that was based on teamwork with other capable individuals fulfilling their specified positions.  Once he began to assemble his team, he saw a major transformation of his company. This transformation included the improvement of his brand identity. He came to realize that the way he had originally branded his company he had actually created a resistance in his market to the purchasing of his product. Originally he had branded his company as Athlete’s Oasis. It looked good but his target audience was not the athlete as much as it was the beginner runner/walker, often baby boomers. They do not consider themselves athletes by any stretch of the mind. This was his first lesson in appropriately branding his product for his target audience.  Now, within the structure of his business he has a chief financial officer (CFO) who can in minutes accomplish what John would take hours to do. She has taken businesses from zero to businesses worth hundreds of millions of dollars. His VP of sales has worked for a Fortune 10 company. He has taken a complete line from scratch to 2.5 billion in two years. This man knows the ropes, he knows the industry, and he knows who to contact to make things happen, to get the job done. The person he had hired for supply chain logistics also has a background of knowing what it takes and right people to contact to get the job done.  John has studied the types of products his target audience already buys. He has structured his new company with these products in mind as he develops over the next couple of years. As he brings on the new products with his private label he knows that it will bring greater value to the company. He believes his chafing cream will set the standard for such creams. His clothing line is being designed by Zhanna Kens (CEO Space grad) who is renowned for her evening wear, Latin dance wear, and custom made dresses for championship ice skaters.  Zhanna Kens  With his new team in place, John is aggressively moving his business forward. He believes that he will have everything in place by the end of the year. His team has assisted him in understanding that each line can be brought in with a minimal investment. They have also assisted him in acquiring the needed investors for the capital as needed.

t5_6,SocialCon,1294330385,"Sarah Palin deserves an apology. When she said that the new healthcare law would lead to “death panels” deciding who gets life-saving treatment and who does not, she was roundly denounced and ridiculed.  Now we learn, courtesy of one of the ridiculers — The New York Times — that she was right. Under a new policy not included in the law for fear the administration’s real end-of-life game would be exposed, a rule issued by the recess-appointed Dr. Donald M. Berwick, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, calls for the government to pay doctors to advise patients on options for ending their lives. These could include directives to forgo aggressive treatment that could extend their lives.  This rule will inevitably lead to bureaucrats deciding who is “fit” to live and who is not. The effect this might have on public opinion, which by a solid majority opposes Obamacare, is clear from an email obtained by the Times.  It is from Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.), who sent it to people working with him on the issue. Oregon and Washington are the only states with assisted-suicide laws, a preview of what is to come at the federal level if this new regulation is allowed to stand.  Blumenauer wrote in his November email: “While we are very happy with the result, we won’t be shouting it from the rooftops because we aren’t out of the woods yet. This regulation could be modified or reversed, especially if Republican leaders try to use this small provision to perpetuate the ‘death panel’ myth.”  Ah, but it’s not a myth, and that’s where Palin nailed it. All inhumanities begin with small steps; otherwise the public might rebel against a policy that went straight to the “final solution.” All human life was once regarded as having value, because even government saw it as “endowed by our Creator.” This doctrine separates us from plants, microorganisms and animals.  Doctors once swore an oath, which reads in part: “I will not give a lethal drug to anyone if I am asked, nor will I advise such a plan; and similarly I will not give a woman a pessary to cause an abortion.” Did Dr. Berwick, a fan of rationed care and the British National Health Service, ever take that oath? If he did, it appears he no longer believes it.  Do you see where this leads? First the prohibition against abortion is removed and “doctors” now perform them. Then the assault on the infirm and elderly begins. Once the definition of human life changes, all human lives become potentially expendable if they don’t measure up to constantly “evolving” government standards.  It will all be dressed up with the best possible motives behind it and sold to the public as the ultimate benefit. The killings, uh, terminations, will take place out of sight so as not to disturb the masses who might have a few embers of a past morality still burning in their souls. People will sign documents testifying to their desire to die, and the government will see it as a means of “reducing the surplus population,” to quote Charles Dickens.  When life is seen as having ultimate value, individuals and their doctors can make decisions about treatment that are in the best interests of patients. But when government is looking to cut costs as the highest good and offers to pay doctors to tell patients during their annual visits that they can choose to end their lives rather than continue treatment, that is more than the proverbial camel’s nose under the tent. That is the next step on the way to physician-assisted suicide and, if not stopped, government-mandated euthanasia.  It can’t happen here? Based on what standard? Yes it can happen in America, and it will if the new Republican class in Congress doesn’t stop it.  [Cal Thomas is America’s most widely syndicated op-ed columnist, appearing in more than 600 national newspapers.

t5_6,cammieshao,1294374723,"(Toronto) — GreenCell Technologies is proud to announce the introduction and launch of HydroCell™, a product critical to an integrated Hydrogen Enrichment System designed to increase fuel efficiencies in diesel trucks, and eventually in all diesel engines. GreenCell has developed a new approach to the anode-cathode arrangement to increase hydrogen output and decrease fuel consumption overall.  HydroCell™ was designed by engineers to operate below the vehicles intake air pressure, thereby eliminating the risk as a result of gas leakage. GreenCell Tek GT5 also designed and specified all key component specifications to exceed requirements, due to the extreme nature of this environment. This has resulted in a cost effective and reliable product, which truly makes Green Technology affordable within the transportation industry, specifically offering costs savings for logistics managers and fleet owners. GreenCell uses circuits employing the latest multiphase switch-mode topology to gain efficiencies of up to 96% and merged them with state of the art sensors and rugged controls to ensure the Hydrogen-enabled system is safe and reliable. Over a fleet-wide test conducted recently over the past three months, Class 8 vehicles were equipped with the innovative GreenCell Hydrogen Enrichment System, drawing power from the vehicles electrical system and generating enough hydrogen throughout the entire RPM range to enhance combustion.  The HydroCell™ is an electrolysis-based on-demand Hydrogen generator designed specifically for the transport industry. The product draws a small amount of power from the vehicles electrical system and uses it to produce Hydrogen gas from a water-based solution. The HydroCell™ directs the produced Hydrogen gas to the intake of the vehicles engine where it acts as a catalyst during the normal combustion cycle. This creates more power and fewer emissions, burning only the existing fuel in the cylinder, resulting simply in less fuel being required to operate the vehicle. Greencell Technologies Inc., Greencell Tek GT5. GreenCell Tek is a Canadian company dedicated to designing and bringing to market, technology-based products for the alternative energy marketplace. Listed on the Frankfurt Exchange: GT5  For further information, contact the GreenCell Technologies Inc. head office in Canada, through email, which can be sent to: Investors@greencelltek.com ",™

t5_2qh9a,Norseman2,1294410643,"Well, the first 'myth' is just flat out wrong. Let's take a look at [the Communist Manifesto](http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Manifesto_of_the_Communist_Party/Chapter_II).   &gt;In what relation do the Communists stand to the proletarians as a whole? The Communists **do not** form a separate party opposed to the other working-class parties.  &gt;They have **no interests** separate and apart from those of the proletariat as a whole.  &gt;They **do not** set up any sectarian principles of their own, by which to shape and mold the proletarian movement.  &gt;The Communists are distinguished from the other working-class parties **by this only**:  &gt;(1) In the national struggles of the proletarians of the different countries, they point out and bring to the front the common interests of **the entire proletariat, independently of all nationality**.  &gt;(2) In the various stages of development which the struggle of the working class against the bourgeoisie has to pass through, they always and everywhere represent **the interests of the movement as a whole.**  So, they formed a separate party, it is opposed to all working-class parties, the majority of its interests are separate from the proletarians, they have no shortage of sectarian principles, they do not represent the proletariat regardless of nationality, and they don't represent the interests of the movement as a whole. So far, we've got 0/6.  &gt;The immediate aim of the Communists is the same as that of all other proletarian parties: Formation of the proletariat into a class, overthrow of the bourgeois supremacy, conquest of political power by the proletariat.  Bourgeois supremacy has returned, and political power is most definitely not held by the proletariat. We're up to 0/8.  &gt;The distinguishing feature of communism is not the abolition of property generally, but the **abolition of bourgeois property**. But modern bourgeois private property is the final and most complete expression of the system of producing and appropriating products that is based on class antagonisms, on the exploitation of the many by the few.  &gt;In this sense, the theory of the Communists may be summed up in the single sentence: **Abolition of private property.**  Property here is probably better understood as capital. For example, apartments, factories, slaves, stock owned in corporations, loans, and so forth. This kind of property allows you to get money from other people simply because you have money (or property). You don't give them any work in exchange, you just take their work and let them use your money or property for a while. If you buy some stock, you get dividends (the company's profit is divided up, and distributed to the shareholders). You don't need to do any work - you just get money because you let people use your money.   This is what communists want to get rid of. Communists would want a company's profits to be divided among the workers. They would want people to stop paying rent and interest. China most definitely still has this kind of property. We're at 0/9 now, and this is the most crucial part of the definition, as the Communist Manifesto itself makes clear.  &gt;The Communists are further reproached with desiring to **abolish countries and nationality.**  We're up to 0/10.  &gt;We have seen above that the first step in the revolution by the working class is to **raise the proletariat to the position of ruling class** to **win the battle of democracy.**  The proletariat is not in charge, and there's no democracy. We're at 0/12.  &gt;Of course, in the beginning, this cannot be effected except by means of despotic inroads on the rights of property, and on the conditions of bourgeois production; by means of measures, therefore, which appear economically insufficient and untenable, but which, in the course of the movement, outstrip themselves, necessitate further inroads upon the old social order, and are unavoidable as a means of entirely revolutionizing the mode of production.  &gt;Nevertheless, in most advanced countries, the following will be pretty generally applicable.  &gt;1. Abolition of property in land and application of all rents of land to public purposes . &gt;2. A heavy progressive or graduated income tax.  &gt;3. Abolition of all rights of inheritance.  &gt;4. Confiscation of the property of all emigrants and rebels.  &gt;5. Centralization of credit in the banks of the state, by means of a national bank with state capital and an exclusive monopoly.  &gt;6. Centralization of the means of communication and transport in the hands of the state.  &gt;7. Extension of factories and instruments of production owned by the state; the bringing into cultivation of waste lands, and the improvement of the soil generally in accordance with a common plan.  &gt;8. Equal obligation of all to work. Establishment of industrial armies, especially for agriculture.  &gt;9. Combination of agriculture with manufacturing industries; gradual abolition of all the distinction between town and country by a more equable distribution of the populace over the country.  &gt;10. Free education for all children in public schools. Abolition of children's factory labor in its present form. Combination of education with industrial production, etc.  The Communist Manifesto was very clear that these policies are despotic, and they are not supposed to be used indefinitely. They are supposed to be used to get rid of capitalism, after which, they would become unnecessary.  So, let's go through them:  1. Abolition of private property: ☐ 2. Progressive income tax: ☑ 3. Abolition of inheritance rights: ☐ 4. Confiscation of the property of emigrants and rebels: ☑ 5. Exclusive nationalized banks: ☑ 6. Centralization of transport and communication: ☑ 7. Extension of state-run factories: ☑ 7. Improvement of waste land and soil development: ☐ 8. Everyone must work, establish industrial armies. ☑ 9. Agriculture and manufacturing combination, city and countryside merger: ☐ 10. Free education in public schools: ☐  Even so, while that looks like 6/11 (I counted 7 twice, for separate issues) none of these met the overarching requirement - that these policies should be used to get rid of capitalism, and should make themselves obsolete. Because of that failure to make these obsolete, and because it was not a democracy controlled by the proletariat that undertook these actions, we can't count any of it. The United States, for example, has a progressive income tax and free public education, but is definitely not communist.  Bring that back to our total and it's 6/23 for semi-communistic-things, and 0/23 for actually being Communist. Even, if it passed that test, it's still missing the most crucial part - the abolition of capitalism.",☑

Abercrombie returns to the blood-drenched arena of the First Law trilogy (The Blade Itself, etc.) with this skillfully crafted and bleakly humorous sword and sorcery adventure. Duke Orso imagines that he can become king by ending the civil wars that have devastated Styria, but he errs by trying to kill his overly popular general, mercenary Monza Murcatto. Recovering from her massive injuries and mourning her murdered brother, Monza vows vengeance on Orso and half a dozen of his accomplices. Employing her own motley crew of death dealers, Monza gets her revenge, but it's neither simple nor satisfying; each target requires fresh strategy, and each death has unexpected effects. Abercrombie is both fiendishly inventive and solidly convincing, especially when sprinkling his appallingly vivid combat scenes with humor so dark that it's almost ultraviolet. (Aug.)

This is some of the best information available. Read it, think about it, and then PUT IT TO WORK.   TNNWC™ Proudly Presents...  This Week’s Article by Tom Guckin Divisional President &amp; CSE, Specialized Financing &amp; Credit Enhancement    The good news is, Caterpillar Company has hired 15,000 new workers in the past year. Great for the economy, right?  Not so fast. The jobs are in northern Germany and of no help to the US economy at all.  Banks are getting “smarter” A recent newspaper article said that banks are remaking themselves into people machines, opening new branches and putting lenders, investment brokers and customer service people out front so that they can sit belly to belly with people like you and me and “get to know us”.  Smarter? After 26 years as a banker, it dawns on me that “belly to belly” is how business used to be done. But CHANGE is GOOD. So...  Need a loan? Need money? Don’t talk to your banker!  Got a great idea? Well, too bad!  Here is a secret…money is available for your good idea. Just NOT from your bank.  Venture Capital is making a comeback. Investment banks are re-entering the fray. Receivables financing, even for a single customer is readily available on the street. Private investors are looking to make money for themselves by investing in you.  You may have to wander off the beaten (and I do mean “beaten”) paths of traditional financing, but the rewards can be well worth it.  Of course, if time is of the essence (and I have yet to meet the successful emerging enterprise where it isn’t) or if financing alternatives is not your strong-suit, follow us TNNWC.com, become a free member, and let us assist in finding you the capital that your business needs.

t5_2qh3p,GSpotAssassin,1294551364,"&gt; When I mentioned her dirty talk the week leading up to our first night having sex, she said she never said those things.  It is shit like this, women. Shit like this that makes us all think you're all a little crazy. But I blame society's unsolvable expectation that women be both angels and whores.  &gt; I told her that I couldnt help being turned on, but it wasn't like I was asking her to have a threesome or anything, and that she just had to get over it  You were 100% right here. Sorry, ladies, that's just how the thing is rigged.  &gt; She just claimed that it made her feel jealous (she is not the jealous type, has not ever given me a problem talking to women, etc.)  Jealousy is a funny ingredient. You know when I had the best sex with a certain ex? After we went to a party, after we had both flirted with other people. It's the very risk that someone else can, would, or might get you off, that breeds the bit of insecurity that causes your SO to try that extra mile to satisfy you. And this is actually why I think sex tends to die in some marriages- neither partner gives the other an opportunity to be flirted with/appreciated/mock-courted by members of the opposite sex, which would both fill their egos and self-esteem and also make them seem sexier and more desirable.  I once gave my coat to a very pretty woman at a bar once who complained about being cold, and she put it over her shoulders. Then, her husband showed up. Oops. Shook hands with him, all good. *But I knew he must have banged the **shit** out of her that night.* And that made me smile for being on the Man Team™.",™

t5_2qh1i,deeweromekoms,1294789274,"So I'm chillin in my apartment with this chick friend of mine, who I've hooked up with on a couple occasions over the previous months and FINALLY after a few drinks, we ended up in the bedroom and clothes started coming off. She had mentioned earlier in the night that she's a squirter, and since A) that's a huge turn on to me and B) I also excel at eating pussy, I dove into her cooter like a thirsty rottweiler drinking out of a toilet bowl.  After a few minutes of my patented Tongue Jive©, she came like a epileptic with a fire hose. It was pretty hot, and I'm a generous guy, so I decided I'd go back for seconds. This time I really went to town with my mouth and fingers and made her scream. Once again, she shot a healthy stream of girl juice right down my esophagus, but this time something tasted... wrong. I mean, I thought the first time seemed a little waxy or something, but now I have CHUNKS IN MY MOUTH???!?!  I turned on the light to the grim discovery that the two of us, my bed, the wall, the lamp, and speckled across the whole fucking room was BLOOD. Like as if I had just slaughtered a pig with a chainsaw. Apparently the bitch was unknowingly just starting her monthly friend and I just SWALLOWED HALF A PINT OF CHUNKY PERIOD BLOOD.  So while I'm in the bathroom throwing up, she decides to turn on the radio to ease the tention, I suppose. It was tuned to the local rock station, and go figure, what else would would be playing right then, but...  ""~Sheeeeeee's my cherry pie~""",©

t5_6,zheejan,1294828713,"GreenCell Technologies Inc. is pleased to announce the successful development and forthcoming release of a new product to complement its HydroCell™ unit.  Based on recent feedback from long-haul truckers, the GreenCell research team has now designed a wireless status indicator that will be manufactured and sold as a package in tandem with its popular Hydrogen Enrichment System.  The innovative device simply plugs into the cigarette lighter on the dashboard and instantly indicates the current status of the HydroCell™ and its present operating condition. The driver will instantly be aware if the HydroCell™ is in need of water and can rectify the condition which will minimize downtime.   The HydroCell™ requires the addition of water every 40 – 50 hours of operation and will shut down and not generate Hydrogen if allowed to run dry. This device will ensure maximum fuel savings by eliminating downtime due to lack of water.  HydroCell™ has exceeded expectations and is typically doubling hydrogen output and increasing fuel efficiencies for transportation companies and independent drivers alike.  Hydrogen, as a fuel, is emission free and the only by-product of combustion is water.  It is the most abundant element in the universe and is the fuel of choice for the Space Shuttle’s main engine.   To assure continued fuel savings, the HydroCell™ is always tested for performance, efficiency, reliability and hydrogen output on numerous vehicles, to enhance its core design and help refine the product specifications for engineers.  In addition to recent discoveries, GreenCell is also conducting extensive lab tests to establish the most efficient electrolyte mixture and the optimal Anode to Cathode distance for maximum hydrogen production.  These tests will lead to new modifications to increase hydrogen output, boost fuel efficiency overall and reduce manufacturing costs.   The HydroCell™ is an electrolysis-based on-demand Hydrogen generator designed specifically for the transport industry. The product draws a small amount of power from the vehicles electrical system and uses it to produce Hydrogen gas from a water-based solution. The HydroCell™ directs the produced Hydrogen gas to the intake of the vehicles engine where it acts as a catalyst during the normal combustion cycle. This creates more power and fewer emissions, burning only the existing fuel in the cylinder, resulting simply in less fuel being required to operate the vehicle.  GreenCell Technologies Inc. is a Canadian company, dedicated to designing and bringing to market technology-based products for the transportation and energy industries.",™

As Stout (The Myth of Sanity) explains, a sociopath is defined as someone who displays at least three of seven distinguishing characteristics, such as deceitfulness, impulsivity and a lack of remorse. Such people often have a superficial charm, which they exercise ruthlessly in order to get what they want. Stout argues that the development of sociopathy is due half to genetics and half to nongenetic influences that have not been clearly identified. The author offers three examples of such people, including Skip, the handsome, brilliant, superrich boy who enjoyed stabbing bullfrogs near his family's summer home, and Doreen, who lied about her credentials to get work at a psychiatric institute, manipulated her colleagues and, most cruelly, a patient. Dramatic as these tales are, they are composites, and while Stout is a good writer and her exploration of sociopaths can be arresting, this book occasionally appeals to readers' paranoia, as the book's title and its guidelines for dealing with sociopaths indicate.

GreenCell Technologies Inc. is pleased to announce the successful development and forthcoming release of a new product to complement its HydroCell™ unit.  Based on recent feedback from long-haul truckers, the GreenCell research team has now designed a wireless status ind  Thus a double benefit is obtained from a virtuous circle: keeping CO2 from entering the atmosphere, and producing renewable products that will reduce the need for fossil fuels.  The GNUL bio-processors contain specially-selected species of micro-algae, suspended in water and nutrients; this provides for optimal growth. Fresh, salt, artesian or recycled water can be used in the process, as can poor quality water. A stream of gas is drawn from the exhaust stack by a blower and passed through the bioreactor where the algae, illuminated by synthetic sunlight, consume the CO2 component by photosynthesis.  Algae can also break down nitrogen and sulphur-oxide pollutants. To achieve this, the greater portion of the algae is periodically drawn off and put through a ‘dewatering’ process; this concentrates the algae so as to finally yield a solid algal cake, suitable for oil extraction and other processing. Most of the water (95%) is returned to the bio-processor. The entire process has a very low energy requirement.  8 Unique Advantages of GreenCell’s Technology      * A full-size plant built around a five layer stack of Bellows GNULs is expected to be capable of capturing 5 tonnes of CO2 per square metre of floor area each year.     * The GreenCell GNULs use a two-stage process to maximise input and output: the first stage creates “sporadic water” in the Bellows GNULs and the second stage grows mature algae cells in the FlatPak GNULs.     * A GreenCell GNUL plant, as a fully closed system, can operate continuously 24/7, unaffected by environmental conditions outside the plant.     * The system used by GreenCell does not require prior scrubbing of nitrogen oxides from the input emissions.     * The inexpensive nature of the materials used, the small land footprint, and the valuable by-products produced, mean that the installation of a GreenCell GNUL plant could be expected to pay for itself within a few years.     * The carbon capture efficiency of the closed system is continuously and accurately measurable by gas content at the input and output points of the plant.     * The GNUL lighting system can be tailored to individual algae species requirements.  In extreme environments, the GNUL system can be moved underground, unlike open carbon capture systems.  About the GNUL  The World now realises what the Earth has been trying to say for some time…. It is running out of breath and now is the time to act, before it is too late. The GreenCell GNUL bio-processor - which can be built into the infrastructure that creates our greenhouse gases - turns our worst problem into our greatest asset. The GNUL replicates lungs that breathe in CO2 and other polluting elements and breathes out sweet oxygen, cleans water for re-use and turns bio-waste into useful by-products. It’s what nature has been doing since life on earth began. A low-energy natural process with measurable results. Now we can all be part of a solution, instead of the problem. ",™

You'll ask her if she is sure that she's outside and she will remember why you guys broke up in the first place, second guess why she's letting you come over at all, get mad, and hang up. Then you'll spend the next half hour trying to find your car, and finally drive off only to end up with several hours that you can't account for, with a vague memory of trying to steal a bottle of vodka from a closed restaurant you wandered into. During those few hazy hours you'll either spend or lose your money (who knows!?) somewhere and stumble into a gas station where you'll try and convince the attendant that its ok for you to take a pack of cigarettes and a Rockstar® without paying for them. He won't see it it the same way, but you'll try and take the stuff anyway. When you run out with the smokes, he will chase you into the parking lot and stand behind your car to keep you from leaving, but you will decide that you've still got this, drive through the grass *around* the gas station and pull a u-turn across a 4 lane thoroughfare, over a median, and then get arrested a few minutes later. I don't recommend it.  For the record though, dxm is a dissociative anesthetic, and as such it did wonders for my staying power on a number of occasions. I really really don't recommend using it outside of its suggested dosage, as it can be neurotoxic. Using it even in the 100mg range with any regularity could have negative effects on your cognition. I can vouch for higher doses having permanent negative effects. However, if you're dead set on trying this I would recommend experimenting in the 90-180mg range, but not going over 240mg, or you may start experiencing psychedelic effects. Good luck to you.",®

t5_2qhlh,ropers,1295015920,"There are basically two types of German WWII documentaries:   Bona fide WWII documentaries, and thinly disguised Nazi porn.   The former are generally quite good, even though a lot of Germans (and some documentaries) still try to resurrect or hang on to the myth that there had been a distinction between ""good German soldiers"" who were ""only doing their job"" and ""didn't participate in and/or know about any war crimes"" on the one hand and *Teh Evil Nazi War Criminals™* on the other hand. That's horse puckey, basically. Save for some very rare and very few acts of conscience here and there, there wasn't really any such distinction. But apart from that, the bona fide documentaries are generally quite good, and generally --insofar as they were produced by Germans for German audiences-- appropriately self-critical.  The latter though do everything they can to include weapons porn that will satisfy gun nuts (a group that strongly overlaps with the German (far) right) and *especially* point out how German military figure such-and-such served in WWII, how many allied troops they managed to kill, etc, etc. -- it's pretty obvious if you watch these (and I've recently bought one of these by mistake) that they really pander to an audience that will cheer every German military achievement and every Allied soldier killed. The thing is, there are laws in Germany against pro-Nazi speech, and pro-Nazi propaganda (and those actually override German freedom of speech legislation, which isn't as strong as in the US), so the makers of such ""documentaries"" can't just go out and make things plain. They essentially only just skirt the thin blue line, while still churning out a product that (neo-)Nazis will like. If it says on the cover that this is a legal factual information program under law such-and-such, that's a dead give-away. Kinda like unsolicited commercial emails that include the sentence, ""This email isn't spam because blah, bla, bla..."" The useful information content of these is generally thin, however they're often stuffed with weapons statistics to an extent that would seem pointless -- unless you remember that the audience is looking for tallies that will show German kills (of Allied troops) and German military tech to come out ahead. I guess if you're a student of WWII historical weapons, you can still extract some useful info from even these, but caveat emptor.

t5_2qh61,TheIcelander,1295025462,"&gt;I understand where you're coming from. That said, even though I'm not a parent (or anywhere near having a child), I feel like I would do the same thing if someone attacked my kid. That's my kid. It's my responsibility to keep him safe. If anyone just attacked him, I feel like I would immediately intervene, and likely violently.  I was at the grocery store with my girls when a woman, totally innocently, stepped between me and the shopping cart to get something off the shelf. Not knowing what she was doing I immediately saw red.  I was able to control myself, but now I know how mother bears feel. If that woman had laid a hand on my kids I probably could have killed her without knowing what I was doing.  EDIT: I'm getting downvoted, so I'll reiterate that this was a completely instinctual response. Frankly it frightened me, and I don't want to feel like that again. I'm not trying to be an Internet Tough Guy™, just trying to explain how it feels when someone fucks with my kid.",™
t5_6,priegog,1295026341,"&gt; Those are not rights. The Constitution is there to prevent the government from deciding what is ""right"" for its citizens. It lets the citizens do that.

Your exceptionalist delusions, coupled with a blatant ignorance of how the world works, only to top it off by feeling you actually know something.  &gt; I don't want switch from politics to economics  Uhm, we're talking politics about economy here? And the way government intervention is supposedly going to affect the way your corporations do business? WTH?  &gt; I will just say that an ant is much more productive than a tiger, but who lives the freer life?  Pretty analogy; excepting that contrary to what your government-mandated indoctrination might have led you to believe, in those countries I'm talking about, and as per the definition of GPD per hour worked, people there are ""freer"" because they work less and have far superior acquisitive powers. They're also happier BTW, and live higher quality lives by any conceivable indicator and poll available. Sorry to bust your Freedom Bubble®  &gt; I would guess China would have the highest.  Are you joking, high, or just so plainly proud of your ignorance that you can't even be bothered to google it? China's population is pretty poor.  &gt; I grant it is a fine point, but these laws were enacted to protect free enterprise.  Thanks for the history lesson, but I'm not seeing anywhere the explanation as to what exactly makes those laws good (or even good back then and bad now), or how impeding huge mergers like in OP would be any significantly different. How exactly do you draw that line? Or do you just wait for Glenn Beck to tell you that? Give me some sort of logical reasoning here, because you're not making any sense.  &gt; I don't live in a Socialist country. I have a government that wants us to become socialist. It is not the first time it has been tried and it is not the last time it will fail  Now you just sound like a prophecy/conspiracy theorist. Good will trump evil in the end!  &gt; In reference to the above discussion, we allow countries like China, which have no anti-trust laws, to produce knock-off good at uber cheap prices and undercut our own businesses  If you're talking about Chine because you think that's what I meant, stop embarrassing yourself. Otherwise, ""you **allow** whomever to do whatever""? WTH do you seriously think you should have the authority to make those sorts of calls? (thankfully you don't BTW, because the real world doesn't work that way)  &gt; Sort of liberal? Isn't that like sort of pregnant?  Yes, precisely, because the political **spectrum** can be perfectly reduced to a binary value. Jeez, no wonder you're trapped in an inescapable 2-party system over there.  &gt; Actually I am completely comfortable with my views (didn't think I would know that one, did you?)  You don't seem comfortable in the sense that you continue going back and forth having completely opposite opinions on pretty similar matters without any apparent rationale behind any of it. Also, if you think cognitive dissonance is a big word... Well let's just leave it at that.   &gt; Laying aside the DSM for a moment  Who the hell brought the DSM into any of this? Oh, I see. Since you went through my comment history you realised I'm into psych, and since you've been trained to make the associations psychiatrist &gt; DSM &gt; fancy words &gt; evil, you figured ""cognitive dissonance"" was a fancy psychiatric term. Sorry to disappoint you, but no.  &gt; Prohibiting a business from doing something because it might not be in the interest of the public- bad for the free enterprise economy. Let the consumer decide. Prohibiting a business from taking an unfair advantage that would impede other businesses from competing- good for the free enterprise economy. It allows the consumer to make decisions.  Ah. Here's the much sought-after rationale. Too bad it's such bullshit, that I actually think this merger would fall under your second condition, while any decent rhetorician could argument that your railroad example fell under the first. Try again, with more concrete terms.  I do find it terribly amusing, though, how you feel the need to qualify everything with ""good"" and ""bad"" tags. Very telling indeed.  &gt; LOL. You residents, especially psychiatric residents (or whatever they are called in your country), kill me  From the sound of it, I seriously doubt you actually know any residents IRL, let alone psychiatry ones. Not that it matters at all, but then again what I do for a living shouldn't either.  &gt; I love your mentally challenging approach to argument (I use the same one), your midstream narcissism always makes you shoot yourself in the foot.  Would this ""mentally challenging approach"" you speak of be ""rational debate"", by any chance? I certainly disagree that ""you use the same one"". I don't know what you mean by narcissism, but I've yet to be shown (by you, I mean, it would certainly be narcissistic to claim I've never been successfully corrected) where I've ""shot myself in the foot"".  Let's shift the focus of this discussion to a more concrete area, shall we? Please tell me, with succinct explanations and real-world examples, why you think a purely capitalist approach (that's the term you've been looking all this time, that you've been mistaking for ""freedom"") is better than government regulation of corporations.

No, it's not.  Again, you missed the point.  You see, you can be rewarded for hard work and or intelligence.  Some people didn't have to work hard at all to become wealthy.  They simply had an idea that others liked.  They may not have had to work 120 hours a week to become successful.  They may have never lifted a damn finger.  &gt;In fact the system simply cannot allow hundreds of millions of Fried chicken proprietors that are as successful and wealthy as Col. Sanders. Sanders.

Gibbs free energy, though, is the quantity that determines spontaneity in constant pressure processes. Because chemistry is usually done in open containers, it's usually the relevant quantity to check if you want to know whether a reaction will be spontaneous. We usually write it as H-TS, where H is enthalpy, T is temp., S is entropy. H is basically U (total energy) plus a term (pressure*volume) that accounts for the fact that in constant-pressure processes where the volume changes, the atmosphere does work on the system. Think of it as the energy at constant pressure.   I'm realizing that I'm getting derailed. The point here is that outside of our nice little atmosphere, you'd want to think about the quantity U-TS, known as A, the Helmholtz free energy. If that's less than zero, the process is spontaneous. In star formation from a uniform gas cloud, U decreases and S does as well; evidently, in the conditions under which it occured, the decrease in U was greater in magnitude than the decrease in S times the temperature.

When you get home from work, cut up the cabbage into medium chunks and toss it in on top of the pork. Cook for another 30-45 minutes and it's done!

t5_2cneq,bptst1,1295266083,"&gt;Great stuff, so what's the lesson you learned here today, sunshine? In the future don't keep proclaiming wildly that people who object to wage slavery are lazy or don't want to contribute to society. It only makes you look even more repulsive. There are many many ways to contribute to society. Just because someone else doesn't want to do what you want them to do doesn't mean they're lazy or that they don't want to contribute to society. That's just downright childish. Seriously, grow the fuck up.  No, people who object to wage slavery and every alternative where the resources they desire are not provided to them by society are lazy.  &gt;You should really stop projecting your shortcomings onto other people. It doesn't make your pathetic arguments any stronger.  I am financially successful, and continue to work towards financial independence.  I am in the process of buying a home that I want and can comfortably afford.  I'm not the one sitting at home, waiting for society to provide me with what I want.  &gt;Again, I know you have a chronic tendency to just make up stuff up but you must realize that it doesn't make your appalling arguments any stronger. What I have been arguing for is to make the means of life and production accessible to all so that the individual can work towards his/her betterment without having to submit and serve some fat unscrupulous capitalist pig. I am arguing for genuine autonomy and liberty. Just because you're a clueless, lazy capitalist zealot who likes everything served on a plate doesn't mean that's what everyone else wants. Self-reliance and independence as I conceive of it doesn't mean being ""entitled to have whatever you want provided by others"". Back during the civil rights movement, people like who would have argued that blacks and minorities should simply accept their station because that's just the way it is™ and to stop complaining. Its exactly the same moral bankruptcy. You worship the status quo and think anybody who is more critical must be a lazy freerider. Please, for your sake, take your head out of your rectum and learn to think more critically.  You are arguing for the right to get what you want for free.  You want property and other resources purchased or created by others to be confiscated and given to you just because you want it (since your basic needs are already being met at this time, even though you won't say how), and you haven't bothered to think beyond that.  Any suggestions on how you could obtain independence within the existing economic system or comments on how others will be treated in your system (where basically everyone who is not you suffers or sees no benefit) is met with hostility, because in your ideal system, your wants and needs are met by society, regardless of whether it is better for society as a whole.  If you wanted to abolish property rights, I wouldn't agree with you, but I'd understand what you are trying to achieve.  However, you just want to limit the property rights of those who have what you want (so it can be given to you), and can't be bothered to consider what happens when the same theories are applied to those with less than you (which is a significant number of people), because you don't care if those theories are applied to others.  You also managed to break new economic ground by claiming that workers are entitled to both a wage and ownership of the product they create (this system would benefit you as well, if you ever managed to find someone who would employ you, since you will never be in a position to offer employment to anyone else).  You just want more for you, and the current system doesn't hand you enough to satisfy you, so you have dreamt up this philosophy based around the idea of having what you want provided to you.  &gt;Also your grasp of political philosophy is appalling and I highly suggest you do some more reading (a lot more reading) before trying to correct others on the subject. You didn't even know that Libertarianism was first used in a political context by anarcho-communists (and is still synonymous with it outside the US) and you hilariously tried to attack me for my usage of it only to have it blow up in your face. Heck, you even cited a wikipedia entry, which if you even bothered to read it, stated exactly that. Thanks for the lulz there.  I know how what libertarianism meant when the term was coined (the first use in the 1700s was political, despite what you claim), that it was claimed by leftists during the industrial revolution, and is now defined differently by a number of different political groups.  I read the Wikipedia entry, though I did learn this already in college.   I find it quite funny that you used the label libertarian as an insult earlier in our conversation, but are now claiming to be one.

t5_2cneq,bptst1,1295270191,"&gt;There is no reasonable alternative when the means of life are monopolized by the capitalist elite in the region. That's the point, you clueless cretin. Oh, wait... you genuinely want us to believe that going out in the wilderness and poking stuff with a stick is a reasonable option for the working class.  Sure there are.  You don't like them, because they would require self-reliance, work, and competency in several areas, but that doesn't mean that they don't exist.  If you were forced to take care of yourself, you'd sit around waiting for a savior until you died, while most people would actually manage to improve their condition.  &gt;What do you mean ""get what you want for free""? That assumes that the capitalist elite rightfully hold a monopoly over the means of life and that I should serve or recompense them to gain access. Did you not even read my explanation about the ontological nature of property? You keep on thinking that private property is some objective fact and that I must agree with current property claims. Private property is just a claim and an assertion, nothing more. I am breaking no law of nature by simply disagreeing with the property claims of the rich. Repeat after me.,, property is an abstraction.  This entire discussion started with your belief that the land and property of others should be confiscated and handed to you, because you don't feel like you have enough currently.  You believe that the property of others is an abstraction, not all property, because you want some for yourself.  You believe in your right to the property that you want, that's all.  &gt;You've obviously been born into wealth and haven't worked a day in your life. Don't lie now. That's why you're so petrified by my arguments. You're scared that if people stop respecting your claim to your inherited wealth you're going to have to get off the internet, off your fat ass and do some productive work for a change. Tough, I say. People shouldn't have to slave away while you're living the easy life writing shitty defenses of your inherited privileges on the internets.  Incorrect.  I have inherited nothing (because anyone who would give anything to me is still alive), and don't even own any land right now, though that will probably change very soon.  I am heading to work shortly, but I know at least one person who isn't slaving away today (you).  I'll be out providing a service that is in demand and allows me to provide for myself, my family, and others, while you sit around and wait for your desires to be met by others.  &gt;You don't even believe that a person is entitled to fruits of his/her labor so this is just the height of irony. You're now contradicting yourself in almost every sentence.  A person is entitled to the fruits of their labor.  The fruits are either:  * the physical product of the labor (which they can then go out and sell or use)   or   * the money given to them for the time needed to produce that product (essentially, they have sold that product in advance for a predetermined price)  not both.    The fact that you can't even grasp this simple concept explains a lot.  &gt;I've already addressed this imbecilic rationalization of capitalist depravity. Repeating your debunked talking points over and over again doesn't make it any more cogent. Here:I am arguing for genuine autonomy and liberty. Just because you're a clueless, lazy capitalist zealot who likes everything served on a plate doesn't mean that's what everyone else wants. Self-reliance and independence as I conceive of it doesn't mean being ""entitled to have whatever you want provided by others"". Back during the civil rights movement, people like who would have argued that blacks and minorities should simply accept their station because that's just the way it is™ and to stop complaining. Its exactly the same moral bankruptcy. You worship the status quo and think anybody who is more critical must be a lazy freerider. Please, for your sake, take your head out of your rectum and learn to think more critically.  I don't think that the status quo is perfect, or that every decision made by society now or in the past was the right one.  I also don't think that anything should be handed to me, though I feel like there should be a better safety net for those who are unable to care for themselves.    However, your theories are all based about one central goal: More for Argandea for free.  That's not a particularly enlightened or noble agenda.  &gt;You just can't bear to be proved wrong, can you? The proof is right in front of us, in black and white, that you were talking out of your ass but you still moronically keep on insisting that you were correct. No, its first usage was to denote a metaphysical position on the nature of free will in the free-will/determinism debate not a political one at all, you liar... In short, stop talking out of your ass, bptst1, and learn to concede when you're wrong.  Sorry, I'm right.  Hint #1: The person who invented the term was a political writer, who created it while writing one of his essays on political theory.  Hint#2: The people behind the American and French revolution were motivated by the idea of free will (that your fate was not determined at birth, like people assumed for centuries before).  It was a radical idea at the time.    Both of those issues sound suspiciously like politics to me.  I realize that understanding my point would require you to do something besides regurgitate Wikipedia entries and either apply some critical thought or actually discuss the topic with someone more knowledgeable about the topic, neither of which you are capable of doing, so maybe I'll go correct Wikipedia right now, and then you'll agree with me.   &gt;Look homes, I gave you a chance but this is just turning into a royal waste of my time. You are almost clueless on this subject but you laughably keep on insisting that I've got it all wrong. You cite wikipedia entries without even bothering to read the contents. You launch into daft ad hominems when your ill-thought position gets even slightly challenged. You think anyone who isn't a witless apologist of depraved capitalism like you and wants a change to the status quo must be a lazy leech on society. Relatedly, you think anyone who doesn't wish to do what you want them to do must not want to contribute to society. You seriously believe that going out in the wilderness and poking stuff with a stick is a feasible alternative for the working classes to wage labor. You think justifications that amount to ""its just the way it is, accept it fool"" or ""society says so, bitch"" are sound moral justifications for depraved capitalism. You think private property is some inviolable law of nature that we must all blindly accept. At this point, I've got to ask... WTF are you smoking? You started of very reasonable and civil but you got progressively more juvenile and unhinged as the discussion went on. As I said earlier, that's a real pity. I'll do both of us a favor and this discussion here. Feel free to have the last word, I know you want it.  That's a lot of babbling without any point.  You're a selfish hypocrite who follows one philosophy, which is as much resources as you want for you for free, provided by those with more at the moment, and no concern for those with less.  Also, you're too foolish and short-sighted to even understand the faults in your theories.",™

t5_6,the_IRF,1295326080,"A Note From the Founder...  http://www.thenationalnetworker.com/TNNW.shtml#chairman  The Great Divide (or ""Of Business and Fish"")  by Adam J. Kovitz   The other day, I had the pleasure of speaking with the former Global Head of Operations Consulting of a well-known International Organization over the phone - man to man. I wasn't exactly sure how this conversation would go as it was the clash of two worlds: one of us had experience working with Fortune 100 companies and solving their major problems...the other was me. Don't get me wrong...I've solved many business problems, but those of small to mid-size enterprises (or ""SME's as he called them) - how could I possibly get this person to understand the trials and tribulations of the ""little people"".  This gentleman admitted to me that Fortune 100 companies had their own way of getting funding that was totally different from that of SMEs and that large business really doesn't understand what SMEs go through. I proceeded to tell him about the entrepreneurial spirit and what drives most that I have known; the desire to want to work for one's self, the freedom of not being a number in a large megalithic corporation, and the potential for making large amounts of money (and, perhaps history as well). I also described the downside as well - working weekends, staying up nights wondering how to put food on the family's table, feeling small, alone and oft times, misunderstood.  I asked him why he left the ""Ivory Tower"" of such a well-established company. He responded that it was for many of the reasons I had stated - mainly, to be his own boss. I told him that I could relate - I've always had a hard time taking direction from someone for whom I had little to no respect. We had achieved a common ground!  He asked why I do what I do with TNNWC and I responded to him that I respect the fact that he swam with the ""big fish"" of the sea, but I prefer the ""smaller fish"". The reason why is that in a healthy ecosystem, big fish survive be eating smaller ones.  But here's the problem...  Due to an unhealthy ecosystem, the smaller fish are threatened and need help to survive and few have come forward as steward to help; although some have claimed to help, there are little results to back up their rhetoric. The smaller fish need a champion and a place where they can congregate and grow. I told him that TNNWC was on a mission to play the role of steward to such fish. The allegory helped, and we decided to continue our conversation at another time as we were both subject to time constraints.  While I certainly look forward to speaking with him again - he may have some contacts that would prove helpful to the TNNWC cause (and vice versa), I believe that we both walked away from the conversation with the following in mind: the more we can encourage such conversation across the divide between large companies and SMEs, the sooner we can change the international business landscape such that we can foster growth, innovation and job creation.

If you can catch the thief, you can get your candy bar back NOW and possibly dissuade other thieves from trying to get the rest of your candy stash.    The world stands as witness that societies (whether religiously- or non-religiously themed) have found impetus to attempt to establish institutions of social, this-worldly justice.  As for your other comment,  &gt; believers are sheep, and the rulers manipulate them ruthlessly.  I would point out that rulers 'manipulate' anyone they rule equally, whether or not those people believe in God, ghosts, FSM, Nationalism or whatever else.

t5_2qh2p,taqwa,1295332128,"&gt; You need to offer a better definition of ethical behavior, to start with.  therefore upvoted! The question of what would be universally acceptable as a definition (not likely everyone will agree on any rule book) for ethical behavior is something I and many of the respondents above have tried to skip.   If we just assume there's SOME standard of ethics for that rational being -- we don't need to know what it is -- we can still question what his motivations could be for choosing the ""ethical"" choice, even without knowing what that would be.  &gt;A purely rational being would say, ""In [a sufficient amount of] time, I will be dead and everything I might have acquired will no longer be meaningful to me. Therefore, there is no purpose in action, and no purpose in inaction, since all actions are rendered impotent by death.""  Given a longer time frame, this is everyone's situation, but I HOPE we can still be rational and go about living even though we'll die someday.   As for the purpose in action, lets just say he gets to eat that one last candy bar before he dies.  (He **LOVES** candy bars).  &gt; In fact, if we strip everything away to the barest minimum, I think we find that ethical and unethical actions are equal in terms of rational merit, since everything can be reduced to arbitrariness.  I don't think that line of thought will lead to any productive discussion. If you're interested, it would go with this: http://➡.ws/mrl  But remember we're not here to define what is ethical, only what rational motivations could cause one to choose it. ",➡

t5_6,hillpeaky,1295419694,"Toronto - With GravSep™ on site, Eldora will use a combination of physical separation processes to extract a concentrate from the first selected mill tailings site in Kirkland Lake, Canada. This concentrate will contain the majority of the recoverable metallic values in these former tailings, as well as the majority of the minerals responsible for the adverse environmental consequences of the original tailings disposal.  The proprietary process includes the preparation of a recirculating water pond, whereby final tailing separation from pulping water will provide recirculating water for pulping fresh feed, thus no continuous use of fresh water is required. After pulping the excavated feed and pumping the pulp through the physical separation process, Eldora anticipates ultimately discharging a tailing material in a form suitable for environmental rehabilitation of the site.  Eldora Gold anticipates, based on initial testing, that the auspicious debut (1/2 tonne per hour) of GravSep™ will result in not only the recovery of valued minerals, but also the rehabilitation of former tailings sites. Given the assembly of its portable equipment, Eldora intends to provide a dual benefit from the operation of GravSep™ units: by marketing the resultant concentrate into suitable channels and also providing a low-energy green solution to mining communities.  The GravSep™ is designed to be scalable, and is suited for small deposits less than 300,000 tonnes that cannot support permanent high capital cost equipment installations. The anticipated advantages for Eldora's proprietary environmentally-friendly physical separation processing, which can be tailored to each specific deposit, now include potential for successful treatment and rehabilitation for many smaller size deposits using simple to maintain and operate equipment, as well as chemical-free processing. Pumping is the single major energy input, and it extracts and recovers valuable mineral concentrates which also have significant deleterious environmental effects when left in-situ.  From an environmental standpoint, tailings have always been an unwanted byproduct of mining. These tailings are left in piles and potentially leach environmentally-destructive materials into the surrounding soil and groundwater. Processing tailings thus also reduces the negative environmental impact of remaining minerals from the original mining process. ",™

t5_2qhk3,daravinne,1295476204,"Many of the things on this list can be done by women too.  Presenting yourself as a classy, refined individual isn't exactly a gendered thing, and makes other people perceive you as a quality person whether you're a man or woman.  1. Good manners - I hope this is a no brainer for everyone, male and female.  I know social rules vary place to place but there are a core set of baseline actions that are pretty much universal and skillful application thereof will ensure that you don't look like a dumbass regardless of the situation.  Being well mannered always shows you in a positive light.  2. Be on time - Or be communicative if you're not.  As a woman, allowing someone I am about to go out with, that I am hitherto unfamiliar with, to come to my house while I'm in the process of getting ready is kind of weird.  We meet at a place, whereupon I am already ready since I'm out in the first place.  (My experience is a tiny bit skewed as a public-transportation-taking city dweller, so YMMV, but I would be uncomfortable having someone pick me up from my house before getting to know them. This is not based off of any sort of fear, but more of a familiarity thing.  If it's a first date, you're probably not my friend yet.)  3.  Compliment your date - Compliments are fine but be genuine, for fuck's sake. Don't make shit up.  If you can't come up with anything nice to say, don't say anything at all.  If there's anything I hate it's disingenuous compliments, and I can tell when you're being Smoove and when you're actually giving me positive feedback on something.  Hell, it's okay if you don't compliment me at all because we're having a serious conversation about astronomy or something else we're both into.  I do enjoy genuine, thoughtful compliments, and conversely, if I find occasion to give you a genuine, thoughtful compliment in the manner that I like to receive I will do so.  4.  Opening doors - Holy christ are we still banging our heads against the wall about this one?  Opening doors is polite for everyone.  EVERYONE.  I just opened a door today for a couple of people carrying a ton of lunch bags.  They thanked me and smiled.  This is how it should be. If you open a door for me to walk through, I appreciate this.    If I open a door I will hold it for you as well.  The sun will shine and the world will turn.  5. Pulling the chair out - This is another YMMV one.  For me its awkward in such a way where I will probably trip over the chair or you while attempting to sit down, though I will not get offended if you do it. Some girls probably eat it up.  Some girls probably hate it.  Use common sense, but if someone makes a big deal over it they're probably the kind to get hung up over stupid shit anyway.  6. Ask questions about your date - Conversation 101, kids. You're GETTING TO KNOW SOMEONE.  Ask about them, but step 2 is to talk about yourself in a way that makes you two relate more closely or draws similarities.  Don't talk too much, and give the other person hooks to talk about themselves comfortably and show themselves to be a conversationalist.  For me in particular I'm not so much into talking about myself all the time but I'd rather find something we're both into and talk about that.  Use Common Sense™.  7.  Paying for her meal - I don't go anywhere without being prepared to cover my share of everything.  If I can't afford my half of the event I don't go.  I will always offer to pay for my half, and by offer I mean I will take the check and see what I owe and take money out, unless said check is removed from my hands.  I try to avoid being treated unless I know the person better, for social safety reasons- as much as guys don't want to be dinner-whored, I don't want to be ""I paid for your food, now blow me""-ed.  This is kind of outside the ""date"" arena but myself and friends who I go to dinner with (mixed gender) tend to have a rotating check-pick-up thing depending who is broke and who's got bling at the time.  I allow people I'm friends with or familiar with to pay for me (if it's appropriate!) because I trust them, and there will always be an occasion in the future where I will be picking up the check for someone else because we don't want someone to be excluded because they are between jobs or just paid their rent.  If you can't pay it back, pay it forward.  8. Offer your arm - Eh. YMMV.  Taking someone's arm makes me overly aware of the fact that our strides aren't lining up and someone's bouncing a little more than usual.  It's not offensive, just distracting. that's just me though.  Other physical touch actions can be substituted if you have some common sense (™).    The gist of all this is basically that politeness is, can, and should be applied by both genders as a default baseline, but there's also a lot of wiggle room for details depending on people's personal preferences and situations.  There's also lots of dumb cunts and slimy douchenozzles and entitled bitches/assholes, but you the individual can always at any time choose to NOT BE ONE OF THEM, and also to NOT PUT UP WITH IT FROM OTHER PEOPLE.    &gt;If you're going to be a courteous, decent human being, do it because you want to communicate your confidence and your control of yourself in any given social situation, not because you feel the need to manipulate, appease, or control others, or get something out of the situation.

""Epoxy adhesives are a major part of the class of adhesives called ""structural adhesives"" or ""engineering adhesives"" (that includes polyurethane, acrylic, cyanoacrylate, and other chemistries.)""  Let me translate. There is a class of adhesives called structural or engineering adhesives. Cyanoacrylates are one kind of structural adhesive, epoxies are another kind of structural adhesives. Both expoxy and cyanoacrylates are structural adhesives, but epoxy and cyanoacrylates are not the same thing.  I am sorry that you call this splitting hairs, but this is a technical forum and this thread is about making fun of others who screwed up technical issues. And you got a technical issue wrong. So accept it and move on.    [Epoxy or polyepoxide is a thermosetting polymer formed from reaction of an epoxide ""resin"" with polyamine ""hardener"".](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoxy#Adhesives)  [Cyanoacrylate is the generic name for cyanoacrylate based fast-acting adhesives such as methyl 2-cyanoacrylate, ethyl-2-cyanoacrylate (commonly sold under trade names like SuperGlue and Krazy Glue), and n-butyl cyanoacrylate (used in the veterinary glues Vetbond and LiquiVet and skin glues like Xoin, Indermil, LiquiBand® and Histoacryl).](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanoacrylate)",®

t5_2qh2s,Niqulaz,1295513237,"There was a piece I read online quite a while ago where Daniel Erickson, one of the developers for The Old Republic, presented some great thoughts on the Sith, and how they developed Sith culture and backstory for the TOR. I can't find it any more, because that article is now getting drowned out by zillions of blogs where authors are creaming their pants over the idea of the Sith warrior class.   The essential of that piece, was how they had approached the Sith, and how they tried to create a something that portrays how the Sith may have been right, and how the Jedi are little better than a emotionless Nazi regime who committed genocide in an attempt to wipe them all out.  I really wish I was able to track that down again, because it provided some great hooks for creating a form of evil that was less two-dimensional than a sheet of paper. It did however essentially deal with how dogma dictates too many odd things about the Jedi, and how they are brainwashed from a young age, and told to never love, never give into their emotions, never let emotions dictate any action, and how all natural emotions are ""paths that lead to the dark side"". And someone like that claims to be The Good Guys™?  One thing worth considering, when it comes to the corruption and the fall of a paladin, is the church dogma, and (at least in previous editions) how a paladin is not only good, but also lawful.   A paladin is, after all, the embodiment of benevolence **and** duty, where the duty is largely defined by his god and his church. A paladin of Lathander, for instance, will have more emphasis on the good part, rather than the lawful part, and his task is to bring light into the dark places. A paladin of Helm, on the other hand, is more bound by duty to law than to good. Read up on Helm, and you will realize that his church is of the kind that has requisition forms for anything and everything.   And the easiest way of getting to a paladin, is to put him in a situation where good and law wont fall in line, and he will have to make a choice between following the orders of for instance a lawful neutral authority, as he should be duty-bound to do, or doing The Right Thing™ which is based more on the idea of benevolence than something established in law.",™

Ideally you want to have your unit production buildings always making another unit within seconds of it finishing, but if you're doing something micro intensive and your money creeps up, throw down some more Gateways.  It's better to have 10 Gateways and warping in 9 units per wave than 8 Gateways and warping in 8 units per wave with additional money you can't spend.  Also, more Pylons.  With 2 bases, with 8 Gateways, you can warp in 16 food worth of units every 45-ish game-time seconds, excluding tech production.  Definitely don't want to get supply blocked as you build up your army towards 200.  Also planting Pylons around the map is a good idea.  Having additional warp-in points is a good idea, but more importantly, Pylons are like Creep Tumors in that you can track enemy movement much better when you have vision damn near everywhere.  Drop Pylons at the mineral lines so you can keep tabs of when your opponent is trying to expand there.  Knowing when they expansion and to where is pretty vital information to have.  Also - Charge.

Sadly this is probably the best, most correct answer. For all we know, such characters were pitched or entire scripts were written covering such thing, but ultimately there are people in suits writing checks to have these shows made so that they can sell advertising.  This has of course always been the case to some extent with TV, and movies, and music, but it unfortunately seems the 'science' of mass-market optimizing by Teh Suitz™ is more influential than ever before.  Or maybe the people steering Trek had lost their spine or just didn't have the vision that Gene had (insert Rick Berman quip here), but who knows.

[ ] Suicide bombers are killing Israeli citizens and collective punishment  will put a stop to this eventually.  [x] The IDF are showing remarkable restraint; They have the power to  nuke the entire region but choose not to.  [ ] It is the fault of the Palestinians that they don't rebuild infrastructure  fast enough after we bomb it.  [ ] Arafat walked out on camp David, proving that 100% of Palestinians  want war, not peace.  [ ] The Jews are God's chosen people™ and this is the land that was  promised to us by a book.  [ ] It is not a genocide until hundreds of thousands of Palestinians are  killed and we aren't even close to that yet.  [ ] 100% of Palestinians are terrorists.  [ ] The Arabs drove the Jews from their homeland thousands of years ago  so it is about time for some payback.  [ ] Israel has killed fewer people than Iran or Iraq which means we are a  peaceful state.  [ ] Carpet bombing an entire country is a perfectly rational response to  the kidnapping of a soldier.  [ ] It's not a concentration camp, it's a safety wall!        [](/troll)  Therefore, your claim of [Criticism against Israel] is false and we should continue to send money and military support to Israel.

Fry it till it tastes the way you want it. Aaand you're done. Almost. Any other ingredients should be prepared separately, and added to the rice at the last minute. If you continue to cook the rice, with moist ingredients in it(ie: meats, veggies) it will return to mush, because at that point, your making risotto, which is good, but not what we're aiming for. And last but not least. Go buy some toasted sesame oil. I use Kadoya®. I can't stress the sesame oil enough. Add it last as well because it has a relatively low smoke point.

Actually, maybe you could enlighten us by showing us someone who did make a covenant with God, but *no words were spoken*?  As far as 'coercing God' goes, or thinking He 'owes you', if that's really the mindset someone is operating from, then they really *should* be questioning their salvation.    If, on the other hand, they know they are 'pretty messed up', as you say, perhaps they can take comfort when God says:  2 Timothy 2:12-13 (New International Version, ©2010)   12 if we endure,     we will also reign with him.  If we disown him,     he will also disown us;  13 if we are faithless,     he remains faithful,     for he cannot disown himself.  Or:  Romans 8:31-39 (New International Version, ©2010)   31 What, then, shall we say in response to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us? 32 He who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all—how will he not also, along with him, graciously give us all things? 33 Who will bring any charge against those whom God has chosen? It is God who justifies. 34 Who then is the one who condemns? No one. Christ Jesus who died—more than that, who was raised to life—is at the right hand of God and is also interceding for us. 35 Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall trouble or hardship or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword? 36 As it is written:    “For your sake we face death all day long;     we are considered as sheep to be slaughtered.”[a]   37 No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us. 38 For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons,[b] neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, 39 neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.  tl;dr:  God is faithful, even though we suck.

t5_2r9vp,highguy420,1295995383,"The lack of cannabinoids does not ""CAUSE"" the diseases, but it doesn't treat or prevent them either.  So, since we evolved in a world where cannabis was so important we have evolved to expect it to be there.  If you take MDMA too frequently you can reduce your body's production of dopamine and seratonin.  In the same way we have evolved for the last few thousands of years to expect cannabinoids to be present in our food and medicine.  Now that it has been removed, our brains expect it to be provided by the environment and, therefore produce very little of it.  If you stopped taking acetaminophen after taking it every single day for the last year and you started getting headaches again, the lack of Tylenol® in your system didn't ""CAUSE"" the headache, it was already there, just masked.    In the same way, our lack of cannabinoids in our environment doesn't ""CAUSE"" cancer, but it does stop preventing and treating it.  So, try to think it through when you throw down the ""causation =/= correlation"" bullshit.  You actually have to take a second and think ""is this guy trying to link the two in a causal manner or is he just mentioning that the two are related?"".  Because you got it wrong this time.  Thanks for playing though, try again next time.  Also, if you do the research, as I have, you will see that the correlation isn't that great.  We have increased the number of dangerous substances and chemicals we are exposed to every day at a much greater rate than the presence of cannabinoids has decreased.  There is a trend that is shown to be in the same direction, but we would have to increase our consumption of cannabinoids at a much greater rate to combat the environmental presence of carcinogens and other sources of cancer.  The outlawing of hemp production also was very soft at first and it took years for the nation to even realize that hemp had been outlawed and that they needed tax stamps to produce it.  It took years for them to start cracking down on hemp, and decades before they started cracking down on recreational use of cannabis.  Many products used hemp and many food products used hemp seeds, and these products continued to use them imported from Mexico, Canada and every single other industrialized nation in the entire world because we were the only retarded enough to outlaw the most useful plant on earth.  Over time we have removed hemp from our raw materials as we replaced them with synthetics.  We don't have a hard cutoff date when the environmental presence of cannabinoids dropped since it is happening slowly over time.  The main point here is that we fucked up by outlawing it.  If it had not been outlawed we would have been treating and preventing cancer with it accidentally all along the way with unrelated medicines (for tooth aches, menstrual cramps, sore muscles, anxiety, etc.) and we would have known by at least 1973, if not earlier, that it was effective at treating cancerous tumor growth and could have started using it for that purpose.  The lack of cannabis in our environment is not the cause of the cancer and other diseases, but it is a factor of the high cancer and other disease rates.  If it had not been outlawed we would have less medical issues today.  If you debate that fact then you need to do some more research.",®

Even when people get that aspect of it right, they often think of it as an *event,* like a thing that happened at a particular moment. That's not it either.  The Big Bang was a period of metric expansion of spacetime. It began, and then all densities in the universe decreased, and as they decreased it became possible for matter to form, which eventually led to galaxies and stars and hedgehogs.  Since the metric expansion of spacetime is *still happening now* — albeit at a much slower rate than it happened during the Really Interesting Time™ — defining an end-point for the Big Bang is entirely arbitrary. Sometimes it's thought to have ended when quarks formed. Sometimes it's thought not to have ended for 300,000 more years, when matter and electromagnetic radiation decoupled.

Martin and Demorro also include facts that were not included in the CNW study: The Prius is partly driven by a battery which contains nickel. The nickel is mined and smelted at a plant in Sudbury, Ontario. This plant has caused so much environmental damage to the surrounding environment that NASA has used the â€˜dead zoneâ€™ around the plant to test moon rovers. The area around the plant is devoid of any life for miles.**  &gt;**The plant is the source of all the nickel found in a Prius battery and Toyota purchases 1,000 tons annually. Dubbed the Superstack, the plague-factory has spread sulfur dioxide across northern Ontario, becoming every environmentalists nightmare.**  &gt;Boy, the use of nickel in an automobile must be unique to the Prius and a substantial amount of that Sudbury plants production.  &gt;Uh, not exactly. This plant puts out 95,000 tons of nickel annually. So the 1,000 tons of nickel that Toyota puts into its batteries accounts for about 1.1% of the annual output and should account for the same percentage of annual pollution.  &gt;This is hardly a surprise as nickel is used in many products including many parts used in automobiles: spark plugs and various alloys (especially stainless steel).

Not only does the research provide important insight into health-related problems linked to individuals with disrupted clocks - such as pilots and shift workers - it also indicates that the 24-hour circadian clock found in human cells is the same as that found in algae and dates back millions of years to early life on Earth.  Two new studies out tomorrow, 27 January, in the journal Nature from the Universities of Cambridge and Edinburgh give insight into the circadian clock which controls patterns of daily and seasonal activity, from sleep cycles to butterfly migrations.  One study, from the Institute of Metabolic Science at the University of Cambridge, has for the first time identified 24-hour rhythms in red blood cells. This is significant because circadian rhythms have always been assumed to be linked to DNA and gene activity, but - unlike most of the other cells in the body - red blood cells do not have DNA.  Akhilesh Reddy, from the University of Cambridge and lead author of the study, said: ""We know that clocks exist in all our cells; they're hard-wired into the cell. Imagine what we'd be like without a clock to guide us through our days. The cell would be in the same position if it didn't have a clock to coordinate its daily activities.  ""The implications of this for health are manifold. We already know that disrupted clocks - for example, caused by shift-work and jet-lag - are associated with metabolic disorders such as diabetes, mental health problems and even cancer. By furthering our knowledge of how the 24-hour clock in cells works, we hope that the links to these disorders - and others - will be made clearer. This will, in the longer term, lead to new therapies that we couldn't even have thought about a couple of years ago.""  For the study, the scientists, funded by the Wellcome Trust, incubated purified red blood cells from healthy volunteers in the dark and at body temperature, and sampled them at regular intervals for several days. They then examined the levels of biochemical markers - proteins called peroxiredoxins - that are produced in high levels in blood and found that they underwent a 24-hour cycle. Peroxiredoxins are found in virtually all known organisms.  A further study, by scientists working together at the Universities of Edinburgh and Cambridge, and the Observatoire Oceanologique in Banyuls, France, found a similar 24-hour cycle in marine algae, indicating that internal body clocks have always been important, even for ancient forms of life.  The researchers in this study found the rhythms by sampling the peroxiredoxins in algae at regular intervals over several days. When the algae were kept in darkness, their DNA was no longer active, but the algae kept their circadian clocks ticking without active genes. Scientists had thought that the circadian clock was driven by gene activity, but both the algae and the red blood cells kept time without it.  Andrew Millar of the University of Edinburgh's School of Biological Sciences, who led the study, said: ""This groundbreaking research shows that body clocks are ancient mechanisms that have stayed with us through a billion years of evolution. They must be far more important and sophisticated than we previously realised. More work is needed to determine how and why these clocks developed in people - and most likely all other living things on earth - and what role they play in controlling our bodies.""

But just as Spain seemed about to confront this dark chapter, Judge Garzón was forced to concede jurisdiction of the case to lower provincial courts. They are unlikely to pursue such a complex and controversial case.  Campaigners, however, refuse to give up. They are to take to court the case of Beatriz Soriano Ruiz. In 1964 she was taken from her mother while still in hospital and disappeared. Her sister, 44-year-old Mar Soriano Ruiz, says: “I hope one day to set eyes on my sister.”  http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-spain-franco-20110107,0,4809520.story Delete  Unlike Argentina, Spain has had no truth commission or trials.  In 2008, Spanish Judge Balthazar Garzon catapulted the fate of the “lost children” into the public spotlight as part of a wider investigation of human rights abuses during Franco’s 37-year dictatorship. But his efforts met with fierce resistance. Accused of violating the terms of Spain’s amnesty law, Garzon has been indicted on charges of abusing his power.  Garzon’s case has stalled, but it broke society’s unwritten pact of silence and spurred more families to come forward.  In addition to the children taken after the civil war for Franco’s brand of political cleansing, child thefts continued into the 1960s and beyond, hundreds of families say, targeting mothers who were vulnerable under the Franco regime.  The later cases also were politically tinged, but the families allege that it was crooked doctors and midwives who stole newborns from clinics, motivated by personal gain.  Blanca Guerrero is searching for her brother, Miguel Angel, who was born June 5, 1945.  Her mother, Agustina, was from a family of known Republicans but was not herself politically active. After being pressured to have her child at a Madrid clinic where she worked, she was told that her son was stillborn. But she always told her daughter that she had felt him moving. Agustina died in 2009.  The case of Guerrero’s brother is among those taken up by Mar Soriano, who is heading a campaign to trace the babies stolen in the later years of the dictatorship. Soriano is looking for her sister, Beatriz, who was born at a clinic in Madrid on Jan. 3, 1964.  “The babies were taken from poor, unprotected people,” Soriano said in a telephone interview. “It was rooted in an ‘anything goes’ culture of impunity. If you knew the right people, I believe you could just buy someone else’s newborn.”  Soriano recounted that her mother gave birth to a “chubby, beautiful and peaceful” girl. But she was discharged from the hospital without the child, who doctors claimed was ill.  Her mother continued bringing milk to the clinic until she was told that the baby had died of an ear infection. The clinic staff said, “We’ll take care of everything,” and told her that Beatriz had already been buried in a mass grave.  Soriano and fellow activists are putting pressure on Spain’s justice system. They petitioned state prosecutor Javier Zaragoza at the High Court twice last month.  But so far Zaragoza has ruled out legal action. Instead, he has suggested that the Justice Ministry set up a DNA bank.  Seekers need the authorities’ cooperation to access archives and open records that are essential to the search.  “This is not about what side you are on,” Soriano said. “Families have always lived with this terrible doubt, with this sense of loss. This is about the search for the truth.”  Healy is a special correspondent.

I'd lean towards [Heritage](http://www.houghtonmifflinbooks.com/ahd/) as being a more reliable source. Furthermore, words are based on their merits, ergo sometimes a dictionary can be wrong (i.e. stupid). Now, if I'm blatantly misspelling a word like ""reciept"" then there is no dispute there. For better or worse, words evolve. For example, if you talked to somebody 100's of years ago, they would think ""thou"" and ""you"" had specific connotations. Now, you has inherited both the singular and plural forms.   If somebody typed out the word ""syke"" or ""psych"", I would not only understand them but also think they are a moron either way.

I recognize a lot of people have quick jobs they need to complete within days, so I need to let you know right away what my workload is * this email will ask a bunch of quick questions if your introductory email didn't cover the basics * within 3 days (sooner if your project is really urgent and I have the ability) I'll call you and we'll have a 15-30 minute chat about what you need * within a week of your first email you'll have my notes on the project, a quick 30-minute draft of how I feel the project will go, and an estimated quote (including timelines) * as soon as you give me the green light by sending a retainer, I'm your web guy!

t5_2qh1e,guysmiley00,1296344081,"&gt;Self-delusion encompasses a spectrum of behaviors. It can include things as innocuous as people thinking they are more important or intelligent than how they are viewed by others to the sort of clinically defined delusional thinking with symptoms like auditory hallucination.  Do you read your posts? All of these behaviours can quite accurately be described as ""believing untrue things"". A person suffering self-delusion may believe themselves slightly better-looking than is  objectively true, or they may believe they are Napoleon. A young man interpreting the ambiguous sounds of his disabled fiancee in a manner that suits his preconceptions falls well within that spectrum.  &gt;Unconditional acceptance is certainly not defined as taking things at face value.  Unconditional - without conditions or limitations; total.   Acceptance - belief (in) or assent (to). (Collins English Dictionary).  If that isn't what you meant by ""take at face value"", what exactly did you mean?  &gt;Potential conflict of interest. (etc.)  Oh, honey - if you're going to try to get technical, it's best to do some research first. What you've said is just gibberish.

(The American Heritage® New Dictionary of Cultural Literacy, Third Edition)  Notice that actually *taking* the decision isn't necessary. So, as a caregiver, merely being in the position of deciding whether to use her in his Idol bid is a conflict of interest, because his interest in advancing his career is in conflict with his duty to make decisions in her best interest. So, given that he is in a position that is the textbook definition of a ""conflict of interest"", and that she has suffered a severe TBI, the onus falls on him to either prove that she is legally capable of making the decision herself, or to allow an impartial party to make the decision.  &gt;I don' think you are very polite.

However large portion of the feedback those guys are getting now are networking issues and performance. I'll skip the netcode problems.  The game is reported to perform badly even on high end computers. My question is: Can most of the bad performance be blamed on lack of optimization/poor coding or is the high spec barrier directly caused by using the XNA?

In some cases, the Serial-ATA (SATA) ports within the chipsets may degrade over time, potentially impacting the performance or functionality of SATA-linked devices such as hard disk drives and DVD-drives. The chipset is utilized in PCs with Intel's latest Second Generation Intel Core processors, code-named Sandy Bridge. Intel has stopped shipment of the affected support chip from its factories. Intel has corrected the design issue, and has begun manufacturing a new version of the support chip which will resolve the issue. The Sandy Bridge microprocessor is unaffected and no other products are affected by this issue.   &gt;The company expects to begin delivering the updated version of the chipset to customers in late February and expects full volume recovery in April. Intel stands behind its products and is committed to product quality. For computer makers and other Intel customers that have bought potentially affected chipsets or systems, Intel will work with its OEM partners to accept the return of the affected chipsets, and plans to support modifications or replacements needed on motherboards or systems. The systems with the affected support chips have only been shipping since January 9th and the company believes that relatively few consumers are impacted by this issue. **The only systems sold to an end customer potentially impacted are Second Generation Core i5 and Core i7 quad core based systems**. Intel believes that consumers can continue to use their systems with confidence, while working with their computer manufacturer for a permanent solution. For further information consumers should contact Intel at www.intel.com on the support page or contact their OEM manufacturer.",®

Domain name seizures also constitute a government taking, which, again, without procedural due process, is unconstitutional. 3. the definition of ""infringing"" is nebulous, at best; what a sneaker manufacturer is willing to call an infringing counterfeit many would argue is simply a replacement, down-market good and, importantly to assume that A. the © owner's claim -&gt; B. constitutes infringement -&gt; C. constitutes illegality -&gt; D. enough to substantiate a seizure without any legal process is just a profoundly naive stance.

t5_2qmg3,smacksaw,1296500028,"Here's my take on the story:  Cowboys sign the Flowmaster to a big money deal and guarantee him a bunch of money up front, even though he is a machine. A penalty machine, a tripping machine, a cheapshot machine, you name it. They rewarded this dude for poor play, and then rather than rehabilitate him, they cast him off like so much garbage.  Flowmaster ends up on the fringes of NFL free agency. The Steelers, a team who normally doesn't sign guys off the street - especially if they have ""issues"" goes ahead and pretty much gives him the $4m a year he's looking for. Even though nobody else was really interested.  He ends up not even playing LT, but RT. And instead of leading the league in penalties, he's quite well-behaved. Look at the link and scroll down. 6 penalies, 4 accepted and 2 declined. A total of 35 yards and only two of these penalties were drive killers.  Yes, folks. Flozell Adams. So I guess he got on board with the Steeler Way™ or whatever you want to call it.  Now he's going to Dallas to play in the Superbowl there after Dallas told him to take a hike. Is that an indictment on the Cowboys and how bereft of a team spirit or philosophy they are? Does it mean Flozell realises he's out of options and needs to get his shit together? I don't know. But someone in the media ought to find out and quit talking about team photos and whatnot.  EDIT: Hey, Packer fan. Why don't one of you figure out something interesting to say about how AJ Hawk went from the bench/special teams to salvaging his career as a starter and becoming a formidable player on defense.",™
