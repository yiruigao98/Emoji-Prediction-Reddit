t5_2qhnf,sup3,1312163294,"I think you're approaching this wrong.  It seems like maybe you're trying to redefine yourself, like you want to convert and start calling yourself a Buddhist.  Doing this wont provide you with any direct benefit, it's inherently something you do for your own ego, something Buddhism outright rejects.  While commitment, and especially effort are important within Buddhism, this commitment and effort have to be applied correctly.  Buddhism is meant to be practiced and with enough practice you will see for yourself the benefits of a spiritual life.  You'll know when maybe you should start calling yourself a Buddhist.  With enough practice you may even see the benefit of taking an extra leap of faith and jumping a bit deeper into the philosophy.  I've found that Buddhism has layers and with more and more understanding certain parts of Buddhism which previously didn't make sense will start making more sense.  Many concepts in Buddhism are difficult to explain using language* and have to be experienced directly, giving you different insight than you had previously.  As for your question about reincarnation, consider the buddhist principle of anatta, or non-self.  When you ask the question, ""what happens to me when I die"" you're making the error of implying the existence of a self.  While buddhism offers some kind of an answer to many of the question about life, the universe, and everything™, with enough understanding you'll realize that some of these question inherently don't make a whole lot of sense within the Buddhist mindset.  *wikipedia the word ineffable, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ineffability",™

t5_2cneq,liberalis,1312187662,"THis is a re-paste of a comment from that article:  [ http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/capital-weather-gang/post/heat-wave-2011-stunning-national-statistics/2011/07/24/gIQAJ1FcYI_blog.html   If you're inclined to think that Rush might have some facts on his side, read the whole article. Or, if you want more ammo to fight against his ridiculous assertions, read the article too.    The heat wave that affected at least 200 million people in the United States during the past week and a half has finally subsided, but not before shattering or tying thousands of records. The geographic extent of the heat wave was highly unusual, with temperatures of 100 degrees Fahrenheit or greater and heat indices much higher than that stretching from Texas to North Dakota, and eastward all the way to Maine.    This one will long be remembered for its widespread scope, high humidity levels, and dangerously warm nighttime low temperatures that remained above 80 F in many locations.    Nationally, 1,966 daily high maximum temperature records have been broken or tied so far this month (through July 23). Sixty-six of those records were all-time maximum temperature records.More impressive, however, are the figures for highest minimum temperature records. Because of the extremely high humidity levels during this heat wave, a whopping 4,376 record highest minimum temperature records were broken or tied through July 23. Of those minimum temperature records, 158 were all-time records.    In many ways, this heat wave exemplified the type of extreme heat events that climate science studies show are becoming more common in many parts of the world, likely due at least in part to manmade emissions of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide. Studies of specific extreme heat events, such as the deadly 2003 European heat wave and last summerâ€™s heat wave and wildfires in Russia, have demonstrated that they were also associated with unusually large, intense high-pressure systems.   In most states on the East Coast, their temperature records go back forever - it is something to break a record high or an all time record high or a record minimum low after all these years of recording temps! ]  Media matters should have done enough research to refute Rushes claim. A google search will give you  some of the record highs recorded on the first page. Not so hard to do.  ",™

Of course that would not have flown in the US because it's all about private Enterprises etc.  Other option: They should have mandated that the banks are being broken down to size and cap the size of a bank at a specific size, I am thinking both leverage ratio as well as total number of assets.  Not to mention, breaking off investment banks from traditional ones.

t5_2qqlo,Moffel,1312223732,"How about this study, for instance? http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022437582900160  'Anonymous random digit dialing telephone surveys of nearly 6000 16–19 year old respondents were conducted in Massachusetts and Upstate New York in 1979–1981. These surveys explored frequency of driving after using marijuana, driving after drinking, respondent accident involvement in the year prior to the interview, and a variety of other respondent characteristics. Frequency of driving after using marijuana and after drinking were each associated with greater accident involvement. To isolate the accident risk of driving after marijuana use, respondents who drove after drinking were excluded from a logistic regression analysis. This analysis also controlled for the distance respondents drove and several respondent demographic characteristics. Compared to respondents who did not drive after marijuana use, teenageers who drove after smoking marijuana on at least 6 occasions per month were 2.4 times more likely to be involved in traffic accidents. Those who drove after marijuana use on at least 15 occasions per month were 2.9 times more likely to have an accident.'  Or this one, from the producers of medicinal marijuana?  http://www.nhtsa.gov/People/injury/research/job185drugs/cannabis.htm  'The drug manufacturer suggests that patients receiving treatment with Marinol® should be specifically warned not to drive until it is established that they are able to tolerate the drug and perform such tasks safely. Epidemiology data from road traffic arrests and fatalities indicate that after alcohol, marijuana is the most frequently detected psychoactive substance among driving populations. Marijuana has been shown to impair performance on driving simulator tasks and on open and closed driving courses for up to approximately 3 hours. Decreased car handling performance, increased reaction times, impaired time and distance estimation, inability to maintain headway, lateral travel, subjective sleepiness, motor incoordination, and impaired sustained vigilance have all been reported. Some drivers may actually be able to improve performance for brief periods by overcompensating for self-perceived impairment. The greater the demands placed on the driver, however, the more critical the likely impairment. Marijuana may particularly impair monotonous and prolonged driving. Decision times to evaluate situations and determine appropriate responses increase. Mixing alcohol and marijuana may dramatically produce effects greater than either drug on its own.'

On three separate occasions, each subject consumed two brownies which contained 1.6 g of marijuana plant material. Placebo marijuana plant material (0% THC) was mixed with marijuana plant material (2.8% THC) so that each subject ingested equivalent marijuana plant material of 0, 1, and 2 marijuana cigarettes (2.8% THC). Subjects scored significantly higher on behavioral measures after consumption of brownies containing THC than with placebo; however, the effects were slow to appear and variable. Peak effects occurred 2.5 to 3.5 h after dosing. Modest changes in pulse and blood pressure also were noted. Urinalyses by EMIT® d.a.u. assay and Abuscreen® RIA for cannabinoids and GC/MS assay for THCCOOH indicated that substantial amounts of marijuana-related metabolites were excreted over a period of 3 to 14 days.

t5_2qi0a,PragMalice,1312298808,"Well... to be honest, it just depends on the university.  There are many programs out there that don't really distinguish between Computer Science (theory) and Software Engineering (application) and will allow students to choose their coursework to favor one or the other.  In such programs, students that lean toward the Software Engineering side of things are going to develop baseline skills and knowledge useful in the workplace in terms of the software development process and coding best practices.  That said, they'll also likely be missing out on many of the theory courses that would be sought after in the games industry (Advanced Computer Graphics, Advanced Artificial Intelligence, Advanced Algorithms and Analysis, etc...) as well as their supporting advanced Math courses that aren't strictly needed to effectively study Software Engineering.  For an effective degree that targets game development, you really almost need a trifecta of CS, SE, and perhaps a minor in some kind of arts degree that specifically targets digital media.  The other way to look at it is to consider getting a bachelors degree in either CS or SE and then follow up getting a masters degree in the other and take as many electives in digital media (and their prerequisites) as you can muster.  @OP: Since you know that you want to target yourself for the games industry, you need to consider what is going to make you as marketable as possible for that industry and invest in the preparation to get there.  Since you're asking the advice it's obvious that you're open to do what it takes.  If you don't think your BI™ is taking you far enough to really make you competitively marketable (it honestly sounds dubious), don't be afraid to switch majors even this late in the game.  It's sure to cost you, but you're still young and you've got plenty of time to slave away for your student loan costs.  From the sounds of it, much of your coursework might still be applicable towards an SE degree (or a CS degree that's effectively an SE degree).  If the SE degree is indeed a separate degree at your school and you don't fancy grad school, perhaps consider switching to a double major of CS and SE.  Hell, you might even consider doing all that in addition to your current BI™.  It's sure to take time, but it will give you a feather in your hat that differentiates you from most of your entry-level competition.  Lastly, as many others have already mentioned, start doing part-time ""indie"" development of your own outside of your classwork to build up a small portfolio of games/programs you can point to that demonstrates your competence in what you study.  They don't have to be particularly flashy or ground-breaking or anything... just something that illustrates that you didn't barely scrape through your education as well as a passion for writing code.  That said, you don't *have* to do all that just to get a job in the games industry, but it never hurts to differentiate yourself given how competitive those job openings can be.  And if the games industry doesn't work out, you're still covered (and differentiated) for finding some other programming work in another industry.",™

Además la Administración para el Control de Drogas de Estados Unidos (DEA, por sus siglas en inglés) dio aviso en años pasados a los principales líderes del Cártel de Sinaloa de operativos policiales en su contra para que pudieran huir, afirmó Zambada Niebla.   Como parte de una solicitud para desechar el proceso criminal que enfrenta ante la Corte Federal del Distrito Norte de Illinois, el hijo de Ismael ""El Mayo"" Zambada afirmó que Washington dio inmunidad a los capos contra cualquier proceso criminal en EU.  ""El Vicentillo"", quien está preso en Chicago luego de ser extraditado en 2010, afirma que el acuerdo se concretó antes de 2004 a través de Humberto Loya-Castro, abogado del Cártel e informante de EU, y que le fue refrendado personalmente por agentes estadounidenses en una reunión en 2009.   ""En algún momento anterior a 2004, y siguiendo a lo largo del periodo cubierto por esta acusación, el Gobierno de Estados Unidos entró a un acuerdo con Loya y el liderazgo del Cártel de Sinaloa, incluidos 'El Mayo' y 'El Chapo'"", asegura el testimonio presentado el pasado viernes por la defensa.  ""Bajo el acuerdo, el Cártel de Sinaloa, a través de Loya, iba a proveer al Gobierno de Estados Unidos información acopiada por 'El Mayo', 'El Chapo' y otros, contra organizaciones rivales de tráfico de drogas mexicanas"", agrega.  Informante desde 1998 para la Administración para el Control de Drogas (DEA, por sus siglas en inglés), Loya Castro fue descrito por la defensa como un confidente de los líderes del Cártel de Sinaloa y a quien, cumpliendo el acuerdo, se le habría desechado un proceso criminal que enfrentó en 2008 en California.   ""Como reciprocidad, el Gobierno de Estados Unidos acordó: desechar el proceso del caso pendiente contra Loya, no interferir con sus actividades tráfico de drogas (de Loya) ni aquellas del Cártel de Sinaloa, a no procesar activamente a (Loya), ni al 'El Chapo', ni al 'El Mayo' ni el liderazgo del Cártel de Sinaloa y a no arrestarlos"", agrega.   Vicente Zambada Niebla, quien tiene mañana miércoles una cita ante la Corte, aseguró que la inmunidad le fue ratificada personalmente por agentes de la DEA durante una reunión en el hotel Sheraton del DF en marzo de 2009, horas antes de ser arrestado por el Gobierno de México.   Las reuniones con la DEA  Según un testimonio escrito (moción) presentado ante la Corte federal, ""El Vicentillo"" afirmó que agentes de la DEA le reiteraron verbalmente dicha inmunidad en una reunión en un hotel del Distrito Federal horas antes de ser arrestado por el Ejército mexicano y la PGR la madrugada del 18 de marzo de 2009.   ""Siguiendo el acuerdo (con EU), Loya acordó que el señor Zambada Niebla se encontrara con agentes del Gobierno de Estados Unidos en el hotel Sheraton de la Ciudad de México en marzo de 2009"", agrega la defensa en otra moción que asegura que contaba con la venia de agentes de EU.  ""Ésta (reunión tenía) el fin de presentar al señor Zambada Niebla a los agentes y con el propósito de continuar proveyendo personalmente de información a la DEA y al Gobierno de Estados Unidos y ya no a través de Loya"", agrega la moción de la defensa que describe la reunión en el DF.   De acuerdo con los documentos, Zambada acudió a dicha reunión bajo gran riesgo físico para él y en ella estuvieron presentes un supuesto agente de la DEA de nombre ""Manny"" -con el que Loya trabajaba- así como otro agente llamado ""David"" quienes le confirmaron el acuerdo de inmunidad.   ""En la reunión (del Sheraton) quedó claro que el acuerdo existente con Estados Unidos -que cubría a Loya y el acusado y por el que el acusado estaba bajo inmunidad de sus acciones- estaba vigente y continuaría"", agrega la defensa encabezada por los abogados George Santangelo y Ed Panzer.   ""Al acusado le fue dicho específicamente que recibiría inmunidad no sólo a partir del acuerdo anterior con Loya, sino por un acuerdo con él personalmente y aprobado a los más altos niveles del Gobierno (de EU)"", agrega la defensa, asegurando que los agentes agradecieron a Zambada Niebla por datos.  ""Al señor Zambada Niebla se le dijo (en la reunión) que una acusación basada en Washington, DC, sería desechada y que estaría inmune de cualquier proceso"", asegura otra moción de la defensa, recordando que ""El Vicentillo"" tenía ya una acusación previa a la que afronta actualmente.  ""Hubo evidencia que en el hotel, el señor Zambada Niebla aceptó el acuerdo y que de ahí en adelante el señor Zambada Niebla proveería de más datos sobre cárteles de droga rivales. Al señor Zambada Niebla le fue dicho por los agentes del Gobierno que estaban satisfechos con la información que les proveería y que haría arreglos para volverlo a ver"", añade.  Dentro de los documentos presentados por la defensa, Zambada Niebla asegura que hay muchos antecedentes de que la DEA se basa en acuerdos de colaboración con informantes dentro del narcotráfico para datos de criminales por lo que el caso del Cártel de Sinaloa no sería la excepción.   Los 'pitazos'  Ante la Corte federal del Distrito Norte de Illinois, la defensa de ""El Vicentillo"" afirmó que tiene pruebas que la DEA tuvo comunicación indirecta con Ismael ""El Mayo"" Zambada y con Joaquín ""El Chapo"" Guzmán como muestra de que EU le otorgó inmunidad el liderazgo del Cártel.   De acuerdo con la moción legal de ""El Vicentillo"", la DEA informó a ""El Chapo"" y ""El Mayo"" de operativos en su contra a través del abogado Humberto Loya Castro.  ""La defensa tiene evidencia que de tiempo en tiempo, el liderazgo del Cártel de Sinaloa fue informado por agentes de la DEA, a través de Loya, si agentes del Gobierno de Estados Unidos y/o autoridades mexicanas realizaban investigaciones cerca de los territorios que son hogar de los líderes del Cártel"", apunta el documento sin citar casos.  ""(Esto) para que los líderes del Cártel tomaran acciones apropiadas para evadir a los investigadores aún cuando el Gobierno de Estados Unidos mantenía acusaciones, solicitudes de extradición y recompensas por la aprehensión de 'El Mayo', 'El Chapo' y otros supuestos líderes así como por el señor Zambada Niebla"", añade el documento.  De acuerdo con el documento presentado por la defensa ante la Corte, tanto los miembros del Cártel como la DEA sabían que el abogado Loya Castro servía como correo entre ellos y que la propia agencia de EU -junto a otras- lo habían vuelto informante desde 1998.  Piden retomar 'Rápido y Furioso'  La defensa de Vicente ""El Vicentillo"" Zambada pidió a una Corte federal considerar incluir datos del operativo ""Rápido y Furioso"" -por el que Estados Unidos habría permitido el tráfico vigilado de armas a México- como pruebas de que EU mantenía un pacto de inmunidad con el Cártel de Sinaloa.  ""Las solicitudes de Zambada Niebla están enfocadas en obtener información gubernamental para determinar si líderes y/o miembros del Cártel de Sinaloa estuvieron entre los individuos que recibieron armas (de Rápido y Furioso)"", asegura la solicitud incluir datos del operativo como prueba.

On the surface, it appears to be quite a clever correlation.  Yet if you dig deeper and discover the outcome of the battle, it doesn’t make sense why they would be so proud to bear the name Trojan® as the most effective protection against invasions.  The female was deceptively wooed by the man. She left her spermicide in the medicine cabinet because he had assured her that is was safe. He slid his condom into her vagina. Once safely inside, his tampered condom broke and flooded her with his sperm. The sperm leader then swam up the perilous Phallopyan Tower and captured the enchanted Egg Princess.  The Trojans failed.  Troy got knocked up.  I could understand, if they sold diaphragms with prefabricated holes marketed towards women who wanted to ensnare men into marriage through pregnancy.

This letter will definitely come to you as a huge surprise, but I implore you to take the time to go through it carefully as the decision you make will go off a long way to determine the future and continued existence of the entire members of my people.  Please allow me to introduce myself. My name is Rt. Hon. Sir. Anomander Purake, the lord of High House Dark, former head of state and commander in chief of the armed forces of the federal republic of Moon's Spawn who escaped its destruction in 1164th year of Burn's Sleep.  My ordeal started immediately after my domain's utter destruction during Battle of Black Coral, in 1164th year of Burn's Sleep and the subsequent scattering of my people and take-over of government of Coral by the new administration of Malazan Empire. The present Malazan government is determined to portray all the good work of my people in a bad light and have gone as far as confiscating all my late kingdom's assets, properties, freezing our accounts both within and outside Coral. As I am writing this letter to you, my sole ally, Caladan Brood, is undergoing questioning with the government. All these measures taken by past/present government is just to gain international recognition.  I and the entire members of my people have been held incommunicado since the destruction of Moon's Spawn, hence I seek your indulgence to assist us in securing these funds. We are not allowed to see or discuss with anybody. Few occasions I have tired traveling abroad through alternative means all failed.  It is in view of this I have mandated Dr Kruppe, who has been assisting the family to run around on so many issues to act on behalf of the family concerning the substance of this letter. He has the full power of attorney to execute this transaction with you.  My late domain had/has Eighty Million UVT (⬆80,000,000.00) specially preserved and well packed in trunk boxes of which only I knew about. It is packed in such a way to forestall just anybody having access to it. It is this sum that I seek your assistance to get out of Coral as soon as possible before the present civilian government finds out about it and confiscate it just like they have done to all my peoples' assets.  I implore you to please give consideration to my predicament and help a widow in need.  May Mother Dark show you mercy as you do so?  Your faithfully,  Rt. Hon. Sir.

Look on the package for the ingredients next time.  I used to work in an emulsifier/stabilizer/sweetener plant, and we used one 10# box of pure sucralose to sweeten 2400# of ice cream.  It's really strong stuff.  One time, I dipped the tip of my pinky into the sucralose and licked it; I about threw up because of how sweet is is.  ""In addition, the bags and packets of Splenda commercially available are not pure sucralose.  They also contain bulking agents.  All artificial sweeteners use bulking agents.  Do you know what they use?  Sugar.  Dextrose, sucrose, and maltodextrin.  (Maltodextrin is corn syrup solids composed primarily from fructose and glucose in a starch form.)   All sweetener packets are at least 96 percent sugar.  Splenda is 99% sugar.  The packets are labelled calorie free as a result of manipulating a loophole in the food labeling laws.  The product can be described as sugar free if a serving contains less than 5 grams of sugar, and calorie free if a serving is less than 5 calories.  So they set the serving size on bags at .5 grams  and the packets contain a serving of 1 gram.  A one gram packet contains 4 calories.   This can be confirmed on the manufacturer’s website in the FAQ section:  “Like many no and low calorie sweeteners, each serving of SPLENDA® No Calorie Sweetener contains a very small amount of common food ingredients, e.g., dextrose and/or maltodextrin, for volume. Because the amount of these ingredients is so small, SPLENDA® No Calorie Sweetener still has an insignificant calorie value per serving and meets FDA’s standards for “no calorie” sweeteners. “  http://jstevens.wordpress.com/2008/02/20/how-sucralose-aka-splenda-is-made-and-why-you-want-to-avoid-it/",®

De las verduras , en la cocina romana , la alcachofa es la mÃ¡s emblemÃ¡tica pero tambiÃ©n se encuentran platos de verduras rellenas como los calabacines , pimientos verdes y las berenjenas . La pasta se come en todas sus variedades , aderezada con tomate , ajo , huevo etc . Lo mÃ¡s sofisticado son los rigattoni alla pajata , acompaÃ±ados de mollejas de ternera . Entre las carnes , el plato estrella es los saltimboca a la romana , pequeÃ±os filetes de ternera cubiertos de una loncha de jamÃ³n y una hoja de salvia . TambiÃ©n el cordero tiene gran importancia . Roma es un paraÃ­so para los amantes de casquerÃ­a que es muy tÃ­pica del barrio de Trastevere . Las especialidades son la trippa a la trasteverina (como los callos) la milza in umido (bazo de vaca estofado) y la pagliata (asadura de ternera con tomate) . Sin embargo , hay poco pescado en la cocina romana . Los restaurantes tienen la obligaciÃ³n de especificar si el pescado  que sirven es congelado o fresco .

One sexually promiscuous woman lowers the sexual value of *all* the women in her group/cohort/community. It's basic evolutionary psychology.   Genetically, we're all cavemen and women. And the cavewoman part of female genes wants to find a man who will (a) impregnate her and (b) stick around long enough provide resources to support their children because pregnancy, birth, lactation, and childrearing require tons of energy.   But a woman who provides sex without also demanding a long-term investment from the man lowers the incentive for *all* men to commit to sexual partners. In contrast, men aren't threatened by a promiscuous man (provided the promiscuous man doesn't have sex with his *his* wife).    It's a double standard rooted deeply in our biology.

t5_2qknj,plumbob,1312485842,"Hey man, I need to disclose that I own a company that makes and sells Arduino boards. But here is my advice:  One of the toughest limiting factors with experimenting with boards is soldering surface mount components, so if you go with a kit, look to see how much of it is through-hole versus surface mount. Some kits even allow you to easily remove the Atmega chip, which means you can easily swap it out if you fry it accidentally. So, I'd definitely look for a through hole kit starting out. Plus, it will really give you a good feel of everything involved with making the board work.  Secondly, if you want to tinker a lot, get a dedicated FTDI breakout board. This is handy if you ever want to try something OTHER than an Arduino board (like LaunchPad®) and you want a common interface library to build your software off of it.   Finally, don't blow everything on the Arduino board itself. The sensors and motors are the most fun part! I recently built a low powered radar that could detect motion behind walls off a $10 Arduino board and a 9V battery. You don't need a lot of components to interface with with the ADC. ",®

t5_2qh0u,JasonMaggini,1312599692,"&gt;You also made quite a jump there from saying everyone is flawed to everyone is evil. Christianity doesn't teach that humanity is evil, merely flawed.  Semantics. Either way, if you don't subscribe to The Truth™ or follow All The Rules™ you're threatened with being thrown on the Cosmic Campfire for all eternity for even minor transgressions. Even if you're an otherwise good person.   &gt;Most religions do say there was a paradise, but most say also there will be one again   Yeah, after you're dead. Nice way to hedge your bets. Can't get any dissatisfied customers looking for refunds that way.  &gt;and encourage people to be better.  For the sake of a mythical afterlife, often at the cost of squandering the real one they actually get.   &gt;The reality is that heaven on eart[h] is impossible  With that attitude, of course it is. And religion is going to perpetuate that, otherwise, who's going to follow it? If you convince people the only true happiness is after they're dead, why should they bother? Better to try for paradise than give up and hope for some magic palace in the sky.  &gt;What is your motivation for being good? If there is no ""reward"" in heaven, what do you propose is a good motivation? The warm fuzzy feeling of helping others? The wealth and the good life or adoration of others by the lucky few? And what is the point of trying any of that if we just disappear to dust anyways when we're gone? Sounds like (and definitely manifests as) a recipe for hedonism which leads to a lot of misery.  I'm good with that. What's wrong with doing good for the sake of it? Just because you need incentive or threat of punishment to be good means everyone thinks like that. You do good, it hopefully inspires good in others. No supernatural hocus-pocus or superstitious chicanery necessary. And if you believe life is finite, you want to make the best of it, it's all the more precious. I find it sad you think so little of people to assume they would all go on a mad murder spree at the drop of a hat.  As Carl Sagan said:  &gt;For me, it is far better to grasp the Universe as it really is than to persist in delusion, however satisfying and reassuring.  Knowing that things are temporary doesn't dissuade me from trying to do good. Some people just don't need threats or rewards to do it.  &gt;I don't hear many Christians these days saying the gay community is filled with ""lesser people.""   You're new to this ""Internet"" thing, then.   &gt;Christianity (read: New Testament/Jesus) doesn't teach that anyone is less of a person for their sins because everyone sins. And in the case of homosexuality, the only way to stop sinning is to change a core aspect of your being, otherwise it's the Eternal BBQ for you. The New Testament isn't as warm and fuzzy as people think it is. Took the NT to really run with the idea of eternal damnation.   &gt;Old Testament laws are either specific incidences made to teach a lesson, or laws specifically geared towards believing Jewish people, not all of humanity.  Of course that doesn't stop people from cherry-picking whatever's convenient from the Old fire-and-brimstone Testament, either. Leviticus, usually.  &gt;You may know more about astronomy or math than a sheep herder in Africa 6000 years ago, but does that make you more wise? Does that mean they knew nothing? Does that mean that the poetry in the Bible is any less beautiful or the life lessons it teaches are any less valid?  What's your definition of ""wise"" exactly? I'm sure they were better sheep herders, sure. Did they come up with a couple of good ideas? Maybe. But morally? If they're going strictly by the bible, I'd stay clear of 'em. I can give you a laundry list of ridiculous outdated ""life lessons"" the bible pushes (concubines, treatment of slaves, genocide, etc. Even in the New Testament).   Plus the Abrahamic religions especially are inherently anti-intellectual, which I find abhorrent.  And as far as the fence analogy goes, the purpose is pretty clear: control. Keep people focused on the differences, so they don't realize that everyone is inherently the same. Distraction.  &gt;Does that mean that the poetry in the Bible is any less beautiful or the life lessons it teaches are any less valid?   As literature, it has its merits. As a basis for everyday life, not so much. Frankly I find it way too violent and misogynistic for my tastes. A few nice passages, but far *too* few IMO.   &gt;The Bible is not just a vessel for tradition, although tradition exists for a reason. The defense of tradition is a core principle of modern conservatism (which I happen to agree with).  Again, not all traditions are good. Often (and sometimes especially) the ones you happen to agree with. I personally don't find the unquestioning herd mentality of ""because that's how it's always been!"" very appealing. Stick with the traditions that don't degrade people.    &gt;if you get so offended because someone disagrees with your behavior, you probably need to grow up and accept who you are and what you do.  Be sure to remember your own words the next time you get your knickers in a twist because someone doesn't think your particular religion is the right way to go.   And again, you've avoided the original issue: **why are people disagreeing with an inherent human quality, if not because of some artificially manufactured ""sin""?** The problem usually isn't with the person being called the ""sinner,"" it's the self-righteous person making the accusation. Whether or not the person can take the accusation well is *completely irrelevant*. ",™

And all of sudden an American soldier who was sitting over a Bradley got a silent sniper bullet in his head and killed instantaneously, and his comrades didn't notice that until they stopped in corner and he fell down to the ground.  The ugly part starts here: an angry machine gunner opens fire from his Humvee mounted M2 and screaming: ""screw all of you!!!"".  Luckily nobody from civilians got hurt AFAIK.  And the sniper used a Russian muffled rifle called VSS Vintorez, and the only user back then was probably the presidential secret services (or special guards).

t5_2qh1i,elohim_algebra,1312682551,"&gt;I'm not interested in getting laid, I'm interested in finding a peer who I can share mutual respect with.  I suggest you focus on getting laid, at least initially and at least in terms of your mindset. Here's why:   Getting laid (or getting in touch with your sexual side) will do more than anything else to boost your confidence with women. You'll walk differently. You'll talk differently. You'll radiate a different energy, and women will react to that energy. In a way, women often can't respect you as a Man® unless you want to fuck them. You send off a ""just friends"" vibe that is not attractive. If you want a girlfriend, you'll need to send a sexual vibe that makes her pelvis twitch.    Some of the seduction community stuff *is* sleazy. But (a) you don't have to use it all and (b) most girls want to be seduced or lured, and the seduction community stuff is generally useful at teaching tricks that women actually respond to. Think of it as a buffet: take what you want, leave the remainder.   For example, the ""three second rule"" is *very* helpful and non-scummy. It simply states that if you're interested in a girl, you talk to her within three seconds of meeting/seeing her. If you wait, you'll second guess yourself, try to build up courage, think of the right thing to say, etc. But if you quickly start talking, before you get into ""paralysis by analysis"" mode, you'll do a lot better.   If there's a seduction group in Portland, they'd probably be willing to give you some pointers on how to speak, what to say, awareness of your body language, etc. Think of it as fantasy camp training for when you meet someone you like.   Of course, sex is not all you want from her if you're looking for a serious relationship. In fact, some studies indicate that postponing sex by at least a few months leads to better long-term relationships for men (see Jack Kammer's free e-book ""If Men Have All The Power, How Come Women Make All The Rules?) But sex is a big part of a serious relationship, and you need to be okay with your sexual desires.   Have you ever seen *Legends of the Fall*? There's a funny scene where brothers Tristan (Brad Pitt) and Samuel (Henry Thomas) are discussing Samuel's girlfriend:   Tristan: Samuel, God bless you. You are good at everything you try to do. I'm sure it'll be the same with fucking. Samuel: Tristan, really. We're talking about my future wife. Tristan: Oh, you're not gonna fuck her? Samuel: No! Tristan: No? Samuel: No! I'm planning to be with her. Tristan: I recommend fucking.   Girls want to fuck, too, and they prefer guys who want to fuck. And they watch that movie repeatedly because they want to fuck Brad Pitt (or Aiden Quinn), not Henry Thomas.   You didn't mention any sexual abuse or other trauma in your life that might result in difficulty with the opposite sex. So my guess is that you just need more practice. Make a habit of talking to ALL women whenever you have a chance. Don't wait until you see some cute girl. It might be good to make a homework assignment out of it. Go to the mall, walk into every other store, talk to a female clerk or salesperson, no matter if she's old, young, fat, skinny, whatever (leave your wallet in the car so you're not pressured into buying anything). Ask for recommendations about whatever she's selling. Ask her to explain the differences between Product X and Z. Make small talk. You'll gradually get better at it, and earn more confidence.   Good luck. ",®

After pulping the excavated feed and pumping the pulp through the physical separation process, Eldora anticipates ultimately discharging a tailing material in a form suitable for environmental rehabilitation of the site. Eldora Gold anticipates, based on initial testing, that the auspicious debut (1/2 tonne per hour) of GravSep™ will result in not only the recovery of valued minerals, but also the rehabilitation of former tailings sites. Given the assembly of its portable equipment, Eldora intends to provide a dual benefit from the operation of GravSep™ units: by marketing the resultant concentrate into suitable channels and also providing a low-energy green solution to mining communities. The GravSep™ is designed to be scalable, and is suited for small deposits less than 300,000 tonnes that cannot support permanent high capital cost equipment installations. The anticipated advantages for Eldora’s proprietary environmentally-friendly physical separation processing, which can be tailored to each specific deposit, now include potential for successful treatment and rehabilitation for many smaller size deposits using simple to maintain and operate equipment, as well as chemical-free processing. Pumping is the single major energy input, and it extracts and recovers valuable mineral concentrates which also have significant deleterious environmental effects when left in-situ. ",™
t5_2qh13,mvlazysusan,1312714222,"&gt;More than 99 percent of both natural and depleted uranium consists of the isotope U-238. One gram of pure U-238 has a specific activity of 12.4 kBq, which means there are 12,400 atomic transformations every second, each of which releases an energetic alpha particle. Uranium 238 has a half life of 4.51 E+9 (or 4.51 times 10 to the 9thpower, equivalent to 4,510,000,000 years).  &gt;Each atomic transformation produces another radioactive chemical: first, uranium 238 produces thorium 234, (which has a half life of 24.1 days), then the thorium 234 decays to protactinium 234 (which has a half life of 6.75 hours), and then protactinium decays to uranium 234 (which has a half life of 2.47E+5 or 247,000 years). The first two decay radioisotopes together with the U 238 count for almost all of the radioactivity in the depleted uranium.   http://www.ccnr.org/du_hague.html    &gt;DU munitions are classified by a United Nations resolution as illegal weapons of mass destruction.

He told nuclear scientists in Paris last year that tens of thousands of sick British and American soldiers are now dying from radiation they encountered during Gulf War I. He found that 62 percent of sick vets tested have uranium isotopes in their organs, bones, brains and urine. Laboratories in Switzerland and Finland corroborated his findings.

t5_2qh63,Elliptical_Tangent,1312769257,"&gt;No, that's the entire freaking point. Figuring out how to do more with less, or with less loss. I think I've discovered another crucial distinction in how we're thinking. You seem to believe that we'll never expand past earth, whereas I'm perfectly willing to drain this rock dry to get our species' eggs into a few more baskets.  We don't have energy enough to leave the planet in like 20 years.  Dismantling the shuttle program isn't a good sign we're getting there before that time.  Also, I'd just like to say that an ideology that only works when we learn to do things currently impossible might not be the most pragmatic.  Instead, it might make more sense to refocus on the problems at hand and solve them with materials we have access to.  Otherwise it's like a junkie dropping his last dime on a hit and saying, ""I'll find money for rent tomorrow.""  This is what I mean when I talk about dangerous ideas — that is exactly what capitalist grow-the-pie thinking amounts to.  &gt;Facepalm. I was giving you an example of how value (meaning perceived value, since I apparently have to reiterate) can be increased, even when there are absolutely no new resources to obtain.  And I told you that it's the only way it makes sense.  I obviously understood where you were going, but it only makes sense in narrowly defined situations that have little to do with the reality underlying the trivial bullshit of, ""What flavor gum should I get?""  Since I also, apparently, have to reiterate.  I'll finish this reply, you've been honest in your debate, but it's really about ideology.  You believe this shit, and I know it's as real as the gods on Mt. Olympus.  &gt;Oooooh, a B+ in Econ 101. I effectively tested out of that the first day of AP Econ in highschool - that doesn't mean I knew shit about economics.  Don't blow your track record of honest debate, chief.  I said that I understood the concepts, not that I was a PhD in econ.  &gt;Resources are the starting point, but what you do with them matters too. The value of resources can be increased, or decreased, and you can improve the total value by figuring out a way to increase the effective value of a resource more than your prior processes. And ""global carrying capacity"" is a buzzword hallmark of neo-Malthusians. We didn't all starve to death in the 19th century, and there's no necessary reason we have to this century, even if our numbers continue to expand. And bluntly, this solar system can support ten trillion humans.   Yes, using resource x to extend the use of resource y does make the resource y situation less dire, but it doesn't expand it infinitely.  And most importantly, the processes that make these things possible are dependent on cheap energy.  Which is running out.  You were an econ-related major, maybe, but I was a biology-related major.  Economics is a philosophy that describes reality for you, but coming from a bio background I know that it describes a Barbie™ version of reality.  When we destroy topsoil with combine tractor farming, it takes 10,000 years to regenerate one inch.  Using fertilizers (not to mention pesticides) not only poisons groundwater, limiting human carrying capacity, but also relies on fossil fuels... which are running out.  So right there we've identified the effect of ""value"" on the system.  We had a resource, fossil fuels, from that we created gasoline, and then combines rise from that.  Combines are too large to farm land efficiently in anything other than topology-ignoring straight lines which result in increased erosion.  We also created petrochemical fertilizers.  In the process of adding this value, we wrecked the topsoil, the groundwater, and the air quality.  But capitalism rules all these things as being external to the equation because it's only concerned with how much money Barbie™ is making.",™

As for studying maths, the report hits the nail on the head with what should be taught: like english, maths should be broken up into two subjects: Arithmetic (or *Real World Maths™*) and Pure Maths.   *Real World Maths™* should be made up of mastering in-your-head calculations; working out change, calculating sale-price deductions, working out and understanding the relevancy of MPG/fuel economy, understanding National Insurance and Income tax. Other units of study that wouldn't necessarily fall under arithmetic would be the ingrained use of ICT in budgeting and other projections.  Pure Maths should consist of thing that we traditionally can't see a instant real-world application for, for example trigonometry and calculus. In these subjects, the old-school method of rote learning should be thrown out and a more integrated style of learning through understanding should be adopted. For example, today children 'learn' that exponential functions often have more than one solution (or 'X=___"") by mindlessly following the FOIL bracket expansion rule. Rather than mindlessly punishing children into busy-work, in pure subjects I see computers being used to teach understanding of problems through programming: get the child to write programs in Python that calculate roots and derivatives from first principles, then quiz them on non-intuitive problems that may require a range of maths tool to solve.

Written and Edited by John R. Hernandez, Jr.  All source quotes have no editing except where emphasis used  What I love the most about those that leave such kind words on my htt://www.newdawnwordpress.com webpage is that many are being sincere and most are actually website owners who honestly took a look or two and found my site and information helpful to them enough to admit to me and to all of us in their own words. My blessing and thanks for all of those who have stood up and helped another fellow website owner receive the accolades from his fellow writers and producers as they feel merit’s it. My special and long overdue thanks to wordpress.com still the best on the internet by far over all the pothers!     From free jsp web hosting on “Poetry I LOVE and My Views and Comments”   “I enjoy your writing style really enjoying this internet site.”    From Katerine Bloedel on “Comments; Values and Morals; and whatever else they don’t want us to know!”   “Great post, but I’m having some problems subscribing to your RSS Feed, anyway l love reading your post.”  REPLY TO RSS FEED PROBLEMS; Hi Katerine, I did check out the feeds and it worked out fine. Sorry you had trouble with it. Try again another time and see what happens and then let me know. Maybe we can figure something out to fix the issue. Anyway, thanks for your sweet and kind words about the site. Sometimes, some people don’t realize what it takes to publish books and write these stories. And when few people show up and leave comments; it makes for example, the 20 hours I spent on Sunday the 7th of August, 2011 putting that day’s page together -with so many problems from wordpress- humbling. But then, when I come by and see comments like yours and all the rest; it makes 2011 worth the while. I am glad that you and everyone else enjoys the stories and I am hoping one day -soon- all of you will unearth the treasure of beautiful poetry found in my book. “In the Birth of a New Dawn”.

Hernandez, Jr. (c) 2011                                  From my new book “Beyond the Dawn”  Together the rain ceases, the sweltering moments of despair fade, the countless moments of hopelessness seem distant; once again. Even these waves once restless and foreboding seem nimble and faint before your smile.

Boehner, an Ohio Republican, said in a statement.” If I remember correctly it was and has been the Republican’s voracious appetite for control of energy resources at whatever means along with it’s global warmongering and it’s questionable relationship with defense contracting and spending; not necessarily because of any overall US policy or interest in pursuing major profits in these areas but as a result of a global energy consortium of conglomerates that wish to take hold and have taken hold of much of this previous decades global oil and gas research and exploration projects-at whatever length.

t5_2qh2b,gerbs,1312868196,"When you sign your two year agreement to get a fancy phone, it says that using your phones data connection in any way other than by direct use of your phone blah blah blah, is a breach of contract.  They can take action against you for breaching contract.  Also, since you broke the terms of the contract, they can choose to cancel it at any time, or charge you, based on what the contract says.  If the contract says that breaching contract results in fees totaling the remaining value of the contract (Lets say you have 13 months left on a 2 year agreement), then they can take you to court and say, this person owes us for the rest of the value of contract because they did things that weren't agreed upon in the contract.  It's all in your 2-year agreement.  No one reads those things, but if your contract says that you can't do those things, then you can't do those things.  If your phone contract says that you can't wear socks with sandals, then sorry, your toes are going to be cold at the beach.  You can probably bring it before a judge and get your contract voided in that case, but that would also mean you would lose phone service.

My only issue with the device as advertised is: ""An initial ToneRite® treatment of 72-144 hours is recommended."" It's just not an option for me.  Also, it seemed that it was advertised on the website not just for new instruments, but also to keep much older instruments sounding great.  In that regard, some free solutions/ideas:  To keep a violin sounding great, Carl Flesh (violin pedagogue of note) recommends cleaning the rosin off of strings everyday and keeping dust out of the body.  ""If used constantly, especially in hot concert halls, one's instrument may develop a 'tired' lackluster quality. In such case it is advisable to reduce the pressure of the strings for a 24 hour period, by tuning them down by and octave or so.  The instrument seems to 'breathe' more freely after that and reward the player with a renewed 'freshness' of tone."" - Art of Violin Playing, book 1",®

t5_2sokd,unndunn,1312912086,"So ""LED, LCD and Plasma"" refer to three (or more accurately, 2.5--more on this in a bit) technologies for displaying pictures on a TV screen.  First, let's talk about the key differences in the technologies and how they work, because it's important to understand this when evaluating the pros and cons of each tech.  **Plasma TVs** work by having lots of tiny gas/plasma bubbles that light up when an electric current is passed through them. This is the same way flourescent lightbulbs work. Tiny color filters in front of each plasma bubble decide what color the bubble will light up as, and three bubbles (one each for red, green and blue) make up a pixel.  **LCD TVs** work by shining a light through lots of LCDs (liquid-crystal displays); when the LCD gets an electric current, it blocks the light passing through it--the more current, the more light it will block. This is how digital calculators work. Colored filters in front of each LCD determine the color of light coming through the LCD, and three\* LCDs (one for red, green and blue\*) make up a pixel. The light source for an LCD TV is called the backlight. \* Sharp Quattron™ TVs add a fourth LCD colored yellow.  This next part comes courtesy of [dakta](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/jdm4u/eli5_lcd_vs_led_vs_plasma/c2bctrq)  &gt; Most\* **Rear Projection TVs** work by shining a very bright light through LCDs, much like an LCD TV. However, instead of the LCDs making up the visible area of the screen, the light is shined very brightly through a small LCD display and then lands on the back of the visible screen. It's basically, as the name implies, like having a digital projector behind the screen.  &gt; \* This applies only to LCD rear projection TVs, which are currently the most common. Other kinds include DLP and CRT rear projection.  **What about LED?** A normal LCD TV basically uses a flourescent lightbulb as a backlight. An *LED* TV replaces the flourescent lightbulb with an array of LED lights (the same kind of light used in newer traffic signals.) Edge-lit LEDs put the LED lights on the sides of the display shining in towards it, whereas backlit LED TVs place the LED lights behind the display shining out towards the viewer (through the display.)  In all other respects, LCD and LED are identical. The only difference is the backlight.  **So lets review (TL:DR):** Plasma TVs work by sending electricity through little plasma bubbles, making them light up, while LCD TVs pass a light through an LCD element, which will block the light if you send electricity to it. LED TVs are just LCD TVs with an LED backlight instead of a flourescent backlight. LCD-RPTVs work by shining a light through a tiny LCD array, and the result is blown up through a series of mirrors and lenses to hit the display screen.",™

So a friend of mine I hadn't seen in a while invited me out to dinner on the May 24th weekend (Guy to my right), and I met the douchebag in purple (Guy on my left, of course). For the first maybe five minutes of conversation, he seemed alright. I can't remember what he did, something vaguely technical, so I told him I'm a tech and I fix computers as my job. It's pretty sweet.  Anyways, then his pitcher of beer comes. I can't really recall whether he turned into this horrid sex-joke spouting neanderthal when this event occurred or if he was already was one, but I remember that the rest of the meal, he wouldn't leave me alone. A friend insisted on snapping lots of photos of us sitting around the table, so he'd lean in and put his hand on mine a couple times. He'd touch my hair, he'd say I smelled nice, he wouldn't shut up about my looks. I tried communicating to people that I was uncomfortable, but no such luck. They were busy having a blast with all the sex jokes and innuendos going around. (Disclaimer: Normally I'd be okay with this, but I was stuck sitting next to a guy *desperately* trying to get into my panties.) At one point during the 'conversation' he proudly declared he was in his ""horny forties"" or something like that. I'm 23.  All the while I also tried the cowardly ""I have another man so back off"" tact: I was texting on my phone most of dinner and kept talking about a guy I was seriously interested in (Boyfriend now ♥). I'd text him things like ""What should I get? Steak or crab?"" to keep the messages incoming and my fingers busy. Any time I looked up from my phone it was to talk about him or something he'd said. Guy was *completely oblivious* to my rampant acts of puppy love and trying to make myself sound unavailable. In hindsight, I should've been a lot more direct.  Finally, I look at the time and OH LOOK IT'S LATE, I have to catch a bus ""before they stop running."" My friends know I live in the middle of nowhere and without a car it's hard to get around. What they're not clear on is that the last bus on a weekend starts it's route at 11pm. It was only eight o'clock or something. I've *had* it with this guy though and I have to bail *immediately*. He asks me for my number and I make up some excuse like ""I don't answer my phone"" or something along those lines. He'd asked me at one point if he could add me to Facebook and did it on his phone immediately, I went home and rejected/blocked him.  I was pretty rude to my friends throughout dinner, but I've talked to them since about how much that guy was bothering me and they seem to understand. Feels bad though :(  **TL;DR:** Horny guy in his forties tries to pick me up at a dinner with friends.",♥

t5_2qio8,vannevar,1312921591,"&gt;Why is your main your main?  I actually have two mains. My flair obviously clues you in that one is a death knight; the other is a paladin. Both are blood elves (for RP reasons: my DK actually used to *be* my paladin character, who was not at all a nice lady, and ended up dead, Scourged, and be-runebladed, so I recustomized my paladin into another female belf who is the polar opposite, personality-wise, and have had no reason to go Tauren, though the paladin was human for a few months. Big mistake). The DK is PVE Blood, with a never-used Frost offspec I may drop for a PVP spec (I understand Blood PVP is a Thing™ and would like to know more about it). The Paladin is Holy/Prot, but I mostly heal on her.  The paladin was rolled at 12:01 PST on Burning Crusade launch day and has been my main ever since. Before her I had a troll rogue who never saw level 40. She was my first 70, first 80 and my first 85. She raided BC content through Black Temple; I quit before Sunwell was fully unlocked and came back in 3.2. She did become a ten-man Kingslayer about a year ago — a little belated, but I still accomplished the goal I set out for her. She is the character on whom I do the most five-man content.  The death knight was rolled around 3.2 as a product of roleplay. She was Frost, and I got her to level 72 before the RP around her petered out. I quickly lost interest in the character after that, stripped her bare, vendored everything worth anything, and deleted her. A few months later, a friend proposed something else that would require me to play a DK, so I had the GMs restore her with the intent of giving her a sex change, but the plot was scrapped. Shortly after that, my boyfriend suggested I play her with his orc warlock; he blacksmithed me together a new set of armor and weapons and kitted me out with necklaces, rings, and bags. I PVPed most of the way to 80 when I wasn't tanking, and discovered that after almost a year's worth of tweaking I actually really enjoyed DK Frost tanking, and raising hell with him in Wintergrasp. The change to Blood infuriated me, but I liked the character too much to shelve it, and now she's my favorite tank on the Citadel. She is the character on whom I raid presently.   &gt;Do you play each of the three main styles of play? (tank, heals, dps)  Yes — in addition to my DK tank and pally tank/heals, I also play a hunter and an enhancement shaman. My prot warrior is next up to go to 85, but after him will be my first caster — a shadow priest.  &gt;Which do you love? Which do you hate?  I love my DK. I love everything *about* my DK. I like tanking, I like PVPing, I like standing on the ramp in the Molten front and dropping DnD and letting all the mobs come at me, bro, and knocking out my daily kill quests in about two minutes.  I really hated my hunter when I was leveling her during Wrath, and resolved that she would probably only get leveled through doing Archaeology, but I did have to get her to 75 once I started making money off Inscription — you can't train Cata-level tradeskills below that point, and nothing was behind the phasewall for scribes and Alchemists, so I didn't have to worry about 84. But in playing her against after the focus change (and switching from BM to marks) I discovered I actually really *like* playing my hunter, and she's been the one I've been doing the most non-raid stuff on lately.  I don't hate any class enough to not play it, but I can't really get into my rogue (I haven't played her since 2.3 and have no idea wtf to do, plus she's Alliance now). I've never played a Mage past 20 or so, but have plans to do so with a friend Soon™. I am not really enthusiastic about my demonology warlock, who recently hit 40.  Of course, I wasn't razzed about shaman either until I rolled my goblin, who was third to 85.  &gt;WTF is up with Ferals? I mean, honestly, I'm a rogue and they even offend me.  Pass. =P The only person I really know who plays Feral is a bear druid and he likes to complain he doesn't have my DK's shiny toys.  &gt;Most fun you've had levelling?  My boyfriend and I often level in pairs, with occasional RP when we're bored of questing, sitting in a dungeon queue, or think our characters would feel very strongly about an event. We rolled a goblin shaman and goblin mage together on the day of launch, and their experience (with such high points as the Lost Isles, Azshara, Stonetalon, and most of the other greatest hits of Cataclysm) has been silly and fun. It even made Vashj'ir bearable. Many Ferengi jokes and many hundreds of puns were made (his character is named Bruce Springsteam, and is nicknamed ""The Boss,"" so you can imagine the level of seriousness involved here).  &gt;Favouritest starting zone?  Tough call. I actually really liked the new Troll 1-5 experience on my druid, where you got the little questing buddy with the voice acting and all.   Lost Isles was very fun — I support any starting zone where you commit insurance fraud — and I actually really enjoyed Gilneas the second time I did it. The first was at 12:01, and there was actually a *line* for Grandma's cat at one point, so you can imagine what a clusterfuck things like rescuing the children on the farm was (there was no line for that).",™

t5_2snuc,EsquilaxHortensis,1312944320,"&gt; As much as I'm intrigued by a Quaker who's read Nick Bostrom  Hah, been a while since I heard that name. Stross and Vinge were the real influences that turned me on to the harder stuff, like Bostrom.   But it shouldn't be all that intriguing; there are two published sci-fi authors that I know of in our meeting (congregation). In general, actually, Quakers tend to be pretty well-read.  &gt; To argue that it's no indication is logically equivalent to arguing that if the first electron microscopes found little ""© YHVH 4,000BC"" tags on every human cell, that would be zero evidence that our universe is not naturally occurring.  I disagree. It would be absurd to suggest that such a thing came about naturally. On the other hand, a natural-appearing universe could easily come about artificially, and this is indeed what we might expect if our creator(s) are in a reality like our own, especially if the ur-reality arose naturally.",©

t5_2sljg,three_dee,1312991887,"&gt;The IWC, unsurprisingly, extends beyond this group. For the best part of the last three years, the hatred towards the man was unexplained and unintelligent,   But at the time, John Cena was extremely popular.  That's why he was a smark/IWC target of ridicule.  It just so happens that at the time, they were right.  Now, he's stale, worn out and extremely unpopular, including with the ""marks"" -- so smarky opinion does a 180 because they like being counterculture, and all of a sudden they decide he's a solid, underrated worker.  &gt;Here's a recent example. the WWE hadn't returned to australia for over a year when I went to see the show in Melbourne at the start of July. When we arrived, my 7yo cousin spent $125AUD buying the full Cena regalia - Shirt, Headbands and armbands, hat - he had everything. When we went inside, you could conservatively estimate that at least 15% of the audience were wearing Cena shirts. At $50 a pop and with 10,000 people in attendance, that man printed them a cool $75,000 just for showing up.  And now, to give this some context: if the WWE spent the last 6 years promoting someone else ad nauseam the way they have promoted John Cena, do you really think your 7 year old cousin WOULDN'T be buying the shirts and armbands of whoever filled that void?  Kids are the easiest merch target.  I don't mean that disparagingly against your cousin; that's just how kids are.  I used to make my mother buy me Transformers as soon as I saw the ads.  Then, I grew up.  John Cena sells merch to kids, and young women; everyone else (70% of the audience) hates him.  Compare that to guys like HBK, Austin, the nWo, DX, etc.; or even Randy Savage and Roddy Piper -- guys who are STILL selling merch to 30+ year olds, even though they haven't stepped in a ring to wrestle a match in 10 years.  Honestly, how can you tell me that a guy who is INSTANTLY booed, when he isn't even in the ring, just when his name is mentioned by someone else, is at the apex of the business in selling merchandise?  Are all those people booing him wearing purple armbands?  Are you really telling me that someone who is ACTUALLY over with the audience WOULDN'T sell more merchandise than someone who is so fiercely hated by wrestling fans?  How can you possibly make that argument?  Even WWE isn't trying to make that argument anymore.  They realize they lost touch with the audience by promoting The John Cena Show™ and are taking preliminary steps to refresh things, some good, some questionable, but all a reaction to John Cena's staleness.  The guys who actually drive the business are charismatic and beloved by the entire audience.  Cena is a marketing gimmick being eaten up by kids.  Even the WWE understands this (though belatedly) and to their credit (better late than never) they are working this phoniness into a hot angle.",™

t5_2r99c,sickpharaoh,1312994734,"&gt; I don't think there is any reason to demonize anything that gives a person a warm, fuzzy feeling inside, as long as it does not lead to negative outcomes, such as wars or genocides, etc.  I think the effect of nationalistic/patriotic beliefs on the discourse and on rhetoric is just as important as any violent manifestations. You pretty much nodded to that with this statement:  &gt; Or even negative behaviors such as ""patriotic bias,"" where you tend to believe things your country says to you over other sources of information.  Take a look at how patriotism is used to pander to certain demographics, not just by the self-proclaimed True American™ GOP (although they rely on it even more, and take it to a new level with both defensive and offensive No True Scotsman accusations), but by any of the prolific Democrats as well. We are constantly told, in lieu of an real plan of action or an articulate position, that America is and always will be #1, AAA, whichever is fitting in the context in which they're speaking. It excuses them from their failings because they cook up some slogan or pep-talk to try and make everyone feel warm and fuzzy, and because patriotism is so ingrained in the average American, say, someone who has never left the country or extensively studied other cultures, it usually works.  The biggest problem I have with patriotism in the US, though, is that it is so inexorably tied religious belief, usually Christian religious belief. It's not that Christians don't have the right to be so, but I do take offense to ""under god"" being in the pledge. It was not historically there. It was added as counter-propaganda, and it worked. Almost everyone I've met in my life did not know that god was added to our pledge and money in the last century. Most believed it had always been there and strongly resisted my claim until I proved it to them. Some of them *still* didn't believe it.",™

Thank you for sharing, it means a lot to me that someone out there is 'with' me. ♥e-hugs♥  I want to ask you a few questions :)   :  how vivid is your memory of these events?  You describe them in detail, but I am wondering how much of this detail is just words to you.  The reason I ask, is that my ""event"" is a very weak memory, I sometimes doubt my own memory.    have you ever had a feeling or sensation trigger the memory of your abuse?  as I said before I have a very poor memory of the event and a certain sensation can trigger that memory.  So I just wanted to know if you have the same thing.  I have similar psychological and social issues that you have, which seem to be typical of someone who was sexually abused.  Anyways I am just rambling thank you for posting this, it really hit me hard.

The first dog I ever got on my own, Dylan, was also an APBT/AST mix. He was incredible. he learned any command we decided to teach him in about 15 minutes. He constantly watched over my partner and I an protected us without intimidating or threatening anyone. He was calm, he was playful, he was cuddly, he was graceful... we were spoiled.  3. Dylan was one of eight dogs killed in a single week in a small town where we lived in Louisiana. We still don't know who was doing it or why, but my heart was irreparably broken and I'll never, ever get over the loss of him.  4. I'm 27. I own two rats, two cats (and am fostering a third), and Fresh, my APBT mix (and am fostering a three-month old Australian Shepherd/APBT mix). I live in a gorgeous house in New Orleans with a big yard and awesome neighbors and live comfortably enough to spoil Fresh for life. Fresh came from a litter of twelve in the Ninth Ward of New Orleans. He spent his life before we got him chained in a backyard with his littermates. He bears quite a few scars as he's the runt of the litter and couldn't quite stand up to his siblings' rough-housing. **Now, let me ask you: If I didn't own Fresh, who do you think would?** Where would he be now?  I have lived with several other dogs between Dylan and Fresh: blue heeler, australian shepherd, border collie, a couple black labs, a rat terrier, a pomchi, and a Catahoula Leopard Dog. Not one single dog reminded me of Dylan (The Best Dog Evar™) or made me feel the same way or want another permanent dog... until Fresh came along. Virtually the same temperament, intelligence, energy level, interests... totally consistent.

As long as you pay attention to the nutrition information and don't pig out, it's not like their food is more ""dense"" in its unhealthiness.  I can't remember the specific name, but one guy ate McDonald's for some months while excercising and became quite fit. You can read dozens of stories about examples of people doing this on the web.  So it's not that McDonald's is inherently unhealthy, it's that the types of food they serve are unhealthy whether the come from McDonald's or are home-cooked. Hence, when McD's serves a healthy item like salad or a parfait, it's not going to magically be unhealthy just because it comes from McD's.  Yes, I do like McDonald's and eat there several times a week on average when I don't have much time at lunch. And yet, I run cross country and have a 12-second 100m time when sprinting.

t5_2rh95,CrimsonQueso,1313111244,"The Coward  The room was cold. Sterile. Its walls were blank. The only feature was a solitary bench in the center. The citizen sat down. Upon sitting, an exuberant voice greeted him.  “Welcome to the longevity panel! We have reviewed your application for a youth grant and would like to begin the interview process! Are you ready to begin?”  “Shoot.”  “In one thousand words or less, please tell me a story that you believe best represents your character. Please remember that you are being monitored by Veritas™ monitoring systems and we will be able to detect any direct lying.”  The man sat laid down on the bench.  “When I was twenty two, before meth was discovered, I visited China. Kind of ironic that they’re having the most success with these population controls now, but I guess they’ve got the most experience.  I was from the first world, America, so I was just lucky to be born with so much more opportunity. I was basically blessed compared to everyone, it was apparent, from my skin color to my height. It felt good. I’d draw looks from the small places that weren’t used to foreigners, but that was enough to make feel like a minor celebrity.   Anyway, I was taking the subway back one day. I had just come back from Lujiazui after visiting the aquarium and the pearl tower, which, by the way, has a beautiful skyline at the night; I’d encourage you to at least Google image it when you get the chance.   So this homeless guy comes into our subway car. I know he’s not supposed to be soliciting us on the subway, I’ve seen beggars get kicked out of the subway, but he somehow managed to sneak by. He starts playing his broken-ass Chinese guitar or something. It sounded terrible.  No one was paying this guy, but he sat there, content with his mad strumming. There was a young couple sitting across from us. The guy gives a ‘I might as well’ look, and tosses the man two RMB. At the time, the RMB was worth around twenty cents. It was change I wouldn’t pick up if I dropped it. So he gives this guy two RMB and his girl is impressed or whatever. Everyone around him starts giving this old guy change. I give him fifteen RMB, because I’m a minor celebrity, right? He makes a tidy profit off of it and leaves.  It was at this moment I had realized what happened. I’m kinda slow, but I realized the reason we weren’t giving this old coot money. It’s because we were afraid. It wasn’t the social norm at the time. As stupid as it is, we’re afraid of getting ostracized for helping the poor when no one else is. From then on, I decided to play the white knight. I’d break the norm and bring money to the beggars. And let me tell you, the beggars in America had nothing on the beggars in the third world. They had people with deformities spouting blessings upon anyone who gives even a tenth of an RMB. Anyway, a couple days later, I’m taking the subway back from a visit to People’s square and I get seated. Two or three stops away from where I get off and I hear the rattling of coins. I see in the distance, two or three cars over, a young woman, younger than I was at the time, carrying a crying infant. She was shaking her begging cup left and right and moving slowly through and no one is paying a goddamn cent. Or RMB. Whatever. Anyway, I figure when she gets to my car, I’d be the shining knight and give her one hundred RMB. She’s kissing people’s feet and groveling and people are just embarrassed for her. But they’re too afraid, or too callous. I don’t know.   What a tough life. When I was her age, I was probably worried about the next time I’d be able to get drunk and party, but her entire life was ruined. There’s no way a homeless eighteen year old can support an infant. She’s plucked into this depressing ordeal, doomed to a life of poverty and struggle. She’s groveling and on the verge of crying, it’s the most depressing thing I’ve ever seen and I was there at the last time the sun ever touched the earth’s natural surface.  The subway starts heading to my stop and I come across a painful realization: This girl won’t get to me before I get off the train. I think about the different things I could do. I could give the money to someone next to me and tell them to give it to that beggar, or I could walk up to her and give her a hundred, in front of everyone.  I sat there, paralyzed. I was too afraid.  I got off of the train without doing anything. I hated myself. No matter how I rationalized it, I was a coward. I knew that any beliefs I could hold, ranging from the idea of blaming her for her poverty to being selfish (why should I give her my hard earned money?) was just a lie to hide behind. It was clearly my cowardice that caused me to stop. I wished I was evil and enjoyed the fact that she would suffer; at least I wouldn’t be a coward.”",™
t5_2rh95,CrimsonQueso,1313111355,"The Strong  It was just a room. If there were no people, no society, would it have meaning? Would it still be a room? This room had a purpose. Many had been in this room, begging for their lives. The citizen sat down.  Upon sitting, a strong voice greeted him.  “Welcome to the longevity panel. We have reviewed your application for a youth grant and would like to begin the interview process. Are you ready to begin?”  “Eat a dick.”  “In one thousand words or less, please tell me how you add value to society. Please remember that you are being monitored by Veritas™ monitoring systems and we will be able to detect any direct lying.” The man sat upright. He crossed his legs and started talking.  “This system is stupid. Go fuck yourselves! You think you have the power to play God? The power to pick who lives and who dies cleanly? I’m here because you faggots need me. Even with all this bullshit protecting the weak, society still must acknowledge its strong. I’m stronger than any of you hiding behind that camera, masturbating over your power. You know why?  I kill people. I accept all the responsibilities of playing God. You need me. You can’t kill under society’s leash. You can only let die. That’s stupid. You need the strong like me to cull the masses.  In a way, I am the incarnation of you that is not a faggot.  I kill the parasites. I kill the cancer that infects the body.  I kill rapists, I kill slavers, I kill killers. I exterminate vampires.  Imagine if meth was a suppository. Then vampires wouldn’t exist; they’d be shit-eaters. Now I like to think myself as an unbiased culler. I will stalk and kill anyone that’s hurting our society. But vampires, they’re the worst. I will drop that pedophile rapist and start hunting down a vampire if it means I have one less of those batfuckers.  At the time I was working with a guy named Jack. Jack’s sister had been killed by vampires a few months back, and he’d been out for revenge ever since. He never ended up getting his revenge, as far as he knew, but I’d say it was likely as we’d killed so many.  Jack was a funny guy. Killing people as a hobby tends to alienate a lot of people, so I’d tell you that this was probably the most fun I’d had in a while. One time, we were trailing this vampire into a nightclub and he starts talking to this girl. She looks like the kind that’s interested in dark, mysterious, violent men. So what does Jack do? He orders fucking milk, from the bar, and chugs a gallon of it. He then proceeds to run up to this chick, and vomits all over her.  Vomit’s flying everywhere and she’s caked in liquidy tacos. She slips and falls into the vomit and starts crying. She starts gasping and hiccupping and midway through, she starts vomiting, adding what looked like Chinese food to the now multicultural stew. Jack probably saved her life. We ended up killing the leader of the vampire gangs a while later. I impaled a spike right up his ass. That kind of death is slow, painful, and ironic. It sent a message to all of them. Jack and I lost touch after that though. He wasn’t interested in killing anything else.  A couple of years later I tracked down another vampire. He had an interesting MO. he’d administer an anesthetic to his victims before killing them.  I finally tracked him to his apartment when I saw Jack there. He must’ve been tracking the vampire as well. I couldn’t wait to share stories. Elation overtook me until that painful realization. Jack was killing these people and drinking their blood. I could see it in his eyes. He told me that he was denied an extension, that the frustration turned into a frantic urge to live. I fought Jack right there. It hurt me so much. He was the closest thing I’ll ever have to someone understanding me.   I cried after. Imagine me, a vicious, bloodthirsty culler, crying. But see? Would you have the unswerving devotion to kill your friends? You're not like me.” ",™

t5_2r368,ropers,1313261539,"The way GIMP's version numbering works is that they use even version numbers for stable releases and odd version numbers for development versions. ([This is moderately common practice for Linux/Freenix software in general. Not everybody does it that way, but I think the Linux kernel does it too.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_versioning#Odd-numbered_versions_for_development_releases))   (EDIT: Odd and even here refers to the minor version number. It breaks down like this: 2.7.3 --&gt; 2=major version number, 7=minor number, 3=release number. The odd minor version number designates it as unstable.)  If you are following the unstable/development branch, then you are already on the (potentially buggy) bleeding edge and you're already using 2.7.something, and you already have single window mode available. What they're saying is that they're going to release the next actual stable version *Real Soon Now™*, and that's going to be 2.8.0.   Version 2.7.3 is likely going to be one of the last unstable/development versions (if not the last) before the 2.8.0 release. Version 2.7.3 will probably not differ all that much from the upcoming version 2.8.0. That said, it is your choice whether you want to jump the gun and install the soon-to-be-out (in the next few days, probably) 2.7.3 rather than wait for the upcoming 2.8.0 (later this year or early next year). Use a potentially still somewhat buggy development version or keep using your old stable 2.6.x version that doesn't have single window mode until the proper 2.8.0 comes out later. Your choice.  Clear as mud?  PS: When they say, ""This feature is one of the most important changes for GIMP 2.8"" they are referring to single window mode, and as I said, single window mode is already available in the 2.7.x development branch.   The earlier sentence, ""For instance, GIMP now saves when it is in single-window mode and starts the next time in the correct mode."" refers to what has just been worked on on the bleeding edge, and that feature is going to be both in 2.7.3 (if it isn't already in 2.7.2 now) and in 2.8.0 when it comes out.",™

t5_2rnve,keptin,1313346739,"Consumer white-LED monitors aren't anything too special, but professional RGB-LED monitors are freaking amazing, albeit they're $3000+.  The biggest things LED-backlit monitors have going for them is a superior dynamic contrast, power savings and a more steady brightness performance over the years.  They do have their drawbacks though, as cheap consumer LED models often have a narrower color gamut, especially for reds.  -Dynamic contrast (DC) means the monitor can lower its backlight brightness when there's a dark image on the screen and raise it when there's a bright image.  This creates a wider range of lights to darks.  LEDs have a wider range of brightness, where as CCFLs can only dim to a point before they begin to ""sputter"".  Unfortunately, there's no standard by which to rate DC, so that's where you get these silly numbers like ""DC: 10,000,00""...numbers that differ widely from one manufacturer to another.  When dynamic contrast is turned off, the monitor uses only the LCD to manage the change in tone of an image through crystal rotation (see How LCDs work) with no change in the backlight.  -Traditional backlighting using cold cathode fluorescent bulbs (CCFLs) has a few drawbacks.  It takes a warm-up period (often 20-30mins) for them to be color accurate, which doesn't affect the normal consumer, but is something professionals have to consider.  CCFL brightness also drops overtime and their voltage has to be increased to compensate...eventually they'll dim to unusable levels (as the brightness setting can only be cranked so high), but it won't occur before the display is obsolete.  They're also more power hungry and produce more heat.     Until RGB-LEDs become affordable, higher quality consumer monitors will use CCFLs as they produce a wider range  of colors...they look better to the *trained* eye.  Most people don't notice a difference in color range, contrast or even PPI/resolution and any changes to the backlighting (CCFL or LED) will make little to no difference to them.  More than anything, LED backlighting is a marketing feature to sell displays.  CCFL models should capitalize on their relatively unheard of acronym with giant rainbow graphics and ""CCFL BrilliantCOLOR™"" all over their boxes.  ",™

In many circumstances (not all, as is sometimes rumored), emergency responders are required to treat everything marked with a biohazard sign as a potential biohazard. If you work at a science lab and decorate the break room with biohazard tape for Halloween, and there’s an emergency and firefighters show up, they’re unlikely to have a sense of humor about it.

t5_2ra72,DoubleAcesHigh,1313355549,"*beams* That just made me grin and do that little ""eeeeeee!"" noise. :) I'm glad it made you feel better. It drove me batshit when I heard the ""you'll do fine!"" In my head I kept saying, ""Yeah, YOU think I'll do fine because YOU'RE not the one up for the test, not to mention you know NOTHING about nursing nor how the damn test works!!! ARG!""   After you get to the test center and the nervous breakdown begins, try and shake it off by imagining yourself as one of very few people able to do it (since not many other professions have such a test, it's true!). Hold your head high and force out a superiority feeling. I kept telling myself, ""Well, the time has come. If I cannot complete this task now, then in 45 days (the length of time they put between retests) I will do it again. This is not the end of my life nor my career. Others have failed, retaken it several times and become great nurses. Fuck it, this is nothing compared to my first semester of clinicals."" (and my college is the only college that does one-on-one preceptorships for ALL 4 damn semesters!) Worked for me, but everyone is different.   And don't forget to be doing *at least* 100 questions a day. I also went to Barnes and Noble and got [Saunders Comprehensive Review for the NCLEX-RN® Examination](http://www.amazon.com/Saunders-Comprehensive-NCLEX-RN%C2%AE-Examination-Nclex-Rn/dp/1437708250) The book was pretty good at recapping everything we needed, but the disc was friggin' awesome when it comes to practice questions. Practice closing your eyes and envisioning a patient in whatever environment the question suggests and you being in the room with them. That helped a lot during the test for me.   Oh hell, do something I completely forgot to do. Do everything you can to memorize things similar drugs have in their generic name like ACE inhibitors (-pril) antiarrhythmics (-ide, -mine) beta-blockers (-olol) cholesterol lowering (-statin) anticoagulant (-in) and so on. I'm TERRIBLE at cardiac drugs and had to [look it up](http://www.vaughns-1-pagers.com/medicine/prescription-heart-drugs.htm#antiarrhythmics) just now to type those things!!! Scares the living hell out of me.   To be honest, I didn't take the NCLEX until July 21st! I graduated in May. There are several areas where I want to end up, those being the ED, OR, or the behavioral health unit (an RN on the BH unit when I was doing my clinicals said, ""it takes a crazy nurse to work with crazy patients!"" so I'd fit in well). I found out through the quick results thing 2 days later I had passed, and saw my license number online at nursys.com on the 28th, later that day my license was in the mail. Heh, as you know, one has to sign the license. Well, I practiced my signature to make sure it wasn't crappy. A few signatures later I was ok with how it looked and went to sign it. Damn thing looks like a 4th grader that just learned cursive! AND I forgot to put RN-BSN before I did the self laminating thing.   I started sending out my resume the 1st, and have gotten a few hits. I found an ad on Craigslist for Mollen Immunizations posted on the 1st so I applied. I had a phone interview the next day, and what was funny about it is I was still in the twilight of sleep! The call woke me up but not enough to make me jump out of bed. I remember the lady asking if I had trouble managing an immunization clinic by myself, if I had trouble with using partial vials, and that's about it. Of course I answered no to those questions. The only other thing I remember is her saying ""congrats, welcome to the team!"" When I finally woke up I was worrying over what the hell I had agreed to, but they sent an email with the job details and instructions for filling out paperwork for HR. It pays $22/hr, but that's pretty good for mundane work (sitting in one area for however many hours and giving shots/shot education). I'm kind of excited about it. I was part of the flu clinics on campus for 2 years and I did 8hrs in the H1N1 clinic last year.   ICU scares me because there's fifty billion things that can go wrong at once. Which brings me to another fear, the cardiac/stroke floor. I had another interview where I was supposed to interview for entry-level inpatient surgical center, but they pulled the bait and switch on me using the latter position to snag people for the former position, since not many people would apply to it. I tried to be as enthusiastic as I could be, but honestly, if they want to hire me, I'd go into v-fib (heh, I have ""benign"" PVCs so it could happen!). Granted, they give a shitload of training and I'd have a mentor for up to 20 weeks, but I'd much rather be in the ED where there's a lot of other people to back me up plus doctors there constantly. And I'd have a lot less patients with heart problems.    Hooooooooooooly shit. I didn't realize how long this post was getting. I wrote a friggin' book!",®

Simply, those who are patient are not going to make posts complaining about key distribution methodologies. Stated differently, you're mostly going to read complaints and negativity.  Closed betas are an interesting animal. Some people tend towards wanting a beta key just to make the claim that he or she had access before the general public.

I would like to offer you an idea that I'm not sure many people have caught. The vast majority of people who are upset that they haven't received a beta key implicitly hold the idea that they actually have a chance of getting into the beta.  Unlike, say, Diablo 3.

The portable app must continue to work (settings and preferences maintained, language selection maintained) as the drive letter changes as the device is moved between computers.

As people have mentioned before small things will throw off build orders (even things like walling/building placement) and real games have situations like hatch block/contain/6p/proxygate/rax ect ect ect that will throw a build order out of the window.  For just learning a build order, though, I don't think you guys could have made it any easier or better than this short of adding that sexy voice to YABOT ~♥  Finally, I know this is probably me being more uptight than I probably should be, but I feel this could be considered an ""unfair advantage"" in online play.  It's no different than a sticky note with chicken scrawl on it, but it's still an advantage for some players.  Thankfully it's not even close to as bad as that one coaching program someone made (the one that watched keypresses to see if you were looking at the minimap, macroing, ect).  Overall I'd have to say kudos for making some of the best build order videos I've seen in a long time.  The idea is pretty novel and a great tool for practice at the least.  Thanks! :D",♥

With NHL®12’s soundtrack we’re looking to continue this trend through a mix of classic songs and new hits.  “The true NHL experience is about intense skill, hard hits, and fast action,” says Steve Schnur, Worldwide Executive of Music and Marketing for EA.  “For this year’s edition, we’ve created a crunching mix of classic arena anthems from artists like Judas Priest and Billy Idol, killer recent tunes from bands such as Dropkick Murphys and Against Me!, and heavy tracks from emerging acts like Middle Class Rut and Manchester Orchestra. We’re also launching all-new songs from upcoming albums by Anthrax and BUSH. The true sound of the upcoming NHL season is the soundtrack of EA’s NHL ’12.”  Here’s the full list of tracks that will be on NHL®12 in alphabetical order by artist (album in brackets):  Against! Me – Occult Enemies (Russian Spies/Occult Enemies)  Anthrax – I’m Alive (Worship Music)  Beady Eye – Standing on the Edge of the Noise (Different Gear, Still Speeding)  Billy Idol – Mony Mony (The Very Best of Billy Idol)  Black Tide – That Fire (Post Mortem)  Blackguard – Farewell (Firefight)  Bush – Sound of Winter (The Sea of Memories)  Death Letters – I Wish I could Steal a Sunset (Post-Historic)  Dropkick Murphys – Hang ‘em High (Going out in Style)  ELO – Don’t Bring Me Down (Mr. Blue Sky: The Very Best of ELO)  Judas Priest – You’ve Got Another Thing Comin’ (Screaming for Vengeance)  Manchester Orchestra – April Fool (Simple Math)  Middle Class Rut – Busy Being Born (No Name No Color)  Murderdolls – Whatever you got, I’m Against It (Women and Children Last)",®

The latter has been on my wishlist for awhile. It looks like it does a good job keeping green wood from checking and splitting at all while drying, but it also imparts a kind of pale, plastic look to everything. Once you've seen it enough, it's very obvious when you're seeing it anywhere. I still want to give it a whirl.  For me, when it comes to dealing with splits, I use Anchorseal on the ends of logs immediately after cutting them, which I do manually with a crosscut saw. I also kind of rely on numbers. I tend to overdo it, bringing home an entire tree worth of wood when I find one fallen around where I live in LA. I've done that probably 6 times now, so I have a lot of wood around my tiny suburban home. In the large piles I'm always bound to find some wood that held up.  Other than that, it comes down to species, and proper handling. You have to set things up for wood to dry properly, and some are next to impossible to keep from checking heavily, like European olive. I cut a fresh round from a log of that and immediately tightened a band clamp around it as tight as I could get it. The next day it had ballooned sideways into a dome, with heavy splitting all over. Even Anchorseal doesn't really help. For those, the best thing I've found to do is immediately cut it up into smaller sizes, and try to get the pith (center) out of there, as checks radiate out from the pith. Seal the ends immediately - every minutes counts - and put them somewhere dry and calm. Many will still split, but some will make it through. I have a bunch of blanks of that stuff in bottle stopper size, some a little larger, that are nice and dry now and check-free, or almost. I also have a bunch of pieces checked so heavily they're unusable. However, you can also get creative and use a vacuum and/or pressure system to drive resin through all the split areas. You can get creative with the colors, and when it hardens, you can turn some pretty cool things - pens, bottle stoppers, tool handles, etc.  As for the eucalyptus, there are [over 730 species](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Eucalyptus_species), and quite a variety of properties to the wood. From what I've seen, it's beautiful, solid stuff. There was one species I brought home, though, which felt made of rubber. The limb could bend tremendously, like it was a big rubber pole. In fact, the limbs fell from the tree because they bent over from too much weight and kind of 'peeled' off the tree. That is definitely one of the weak species. Others are crazy hard. Some I have feel like oak, or even harder.  As for what I did with them, I moved them onto the back cement patio, and there they've sat for too long now. I call it ""drying time."" Really I'm just working up the energy to resaw them by hand with my 3' crosscutting saw :)",™

If it's from life or takes two days then it would be more like $500-600. That may seem like a lot, but I work long days so after expenses it works out at about $16 an hour, which is about the average wage where I live, and of course there are also some days when I don't have any commissions.  But I have painter friends who charge a bit less and others who charge a lot more. It's one of those things where your market value depends a lot on what people are prepared to pay for your time, and that isn't always determined by the quality of your work. A lot of painters who aren't technically very good at all can charge a hell of a lot for their stuff just because they (or their gallery) is good at marketing, whilst if you look around for a while you can usually find at least a couple of people who are really talented but are broke and so can be persuaded to work for peanuts.

t5_2qh1i,robertbieber,1313996111,"You're right, *you* don't need to pay taxes to keep the poor starving.  Unfortunately for them, *the poor* do depend on those taxes and government programs.  For those of us who are (relatively, at least) wealthy, charity is a choice we can make on a whim.  ""Oh, I think today I'll let some of the homeless on Burn Street have a meal.  Only the ones who don't do drugs, though, I wouldn't want to enable their bad habits.  And maybe tomorrow I'll drop off some canned food for the women's shelter.""  For the people on the other end, charity isn't a whimsical choice you make every now and then, it's a matter of life and death.  You can't build a healthy society on the notion that the poor will have food and shelter and medical attention *if and when someone decides to give it to them*.  In reality, you have to eat when you're hungry, not when some kind, rich soul deigns to deliver a bowl of soup to you.  What the poor need is consistent, reliable, guaranteed aid through official channels that they can depend on when they need it.  This is especially true for the particularly ""undesirable"" members of our society.  If you're a good, honest man down on his luck struggling to get back on his feet The Right Way™, everyone wants to give you a hand up.  In reality, on the other hand, that's just not how life on the street works for most people.  When you're hopelessly addicted to cocaine and all the rich charitable folk just want to turn their noses up at you and quip about how their charity would be ""wasted"" on you, then what are you supposed to do?  I think people forget that drug addicts have to eat too.",™
t5_2sfmf,sheasie,1314005584,"Anything that prevents businesses from exploiting natural resources will prevent jobs -- in the short term.  It's that simple.    In the long term, it really depends on how good the social planning mechanisms are... with sound social planning, and EPA will preserve natural resources that result in a better quality of life; therefor, greater overall job stability (which minimizes rescissions and massive layoffs).  On the other hand if your social planning mechanisms are as poor as they were under the Bush Administration, no amount of EPA will help long term.  **Bottom Line:**  Yes.  The EPA is a job killer.  ** *Big Fucking Deal.*  Robots are job killers** (how many auto-workers have been put of work due to robots on the assembly line.  Are you suggesting that we ban robots?)  Minimum wages employment regulations are job killers.  (Think of how many children we could employ if only it were legal to hire 12 year olds -- and not have to insure them against on-the-job accidents!!  Wow!!  We could end the unemployment problem overnight of only there were no employment regulations!!)  People need to stop focusing on jobs as the measure of national value.  That's not the issue.  It's (still) the economy, stupid -- which is a much ""broader playing"" field.    **We need to leverage technology  in our favor... and grow the job market... not by enabling more exploitation and less oversight... but by investing in new technologies, like solar, stemcells and quantum mechanics**.  Instead, we subsidize old ones like Oil Wars, Prozak™ and Creationism ???  For Example:  Iraq &amp; Afg. has cost USD1.5 Trillion (conservatively).  Had we invested ** *HALF* ** of that cash (USD 750,000,000,000.00) in this technology, for example:  http://www.gizmag.com/enviromission-solar-tower-arizona-clean-energy-renewable/19287/  ...we could have built 1000 of them.  ** *Each one* ** powers 150,000 households (for 80 years - for free).  1000 ""power tubes"" x 150,000 households = enough to power 150 million households -- for 80 years -- for free.  (there are 140 million housing units in the US.)    Yes.. that's right folks... for HALF (very conservatively) of the cost of the invasion of Iraq and Afg., **we could have built enough power tubes to power every single housing unit in the US for 80 years *FOR FREE!!!!!!!* **  Can you imagine how much money Americans would save?  How much they would spend on buying more shit... and how many jobs that entire process would have created??  Instead, we are funding a multi-Trillion dollar stimulus of the Iraqi economy?

t5_2cneq,Dereleased,1314127032,"That it is ridiculous to have the goddamn police running around shutting down a child's lemonade stand on the grounds that they did not obtain the proper permits.  A child saving up money to do something childlike, say, going to the fair, does not have $430+ in capital to invest in the permits for a lemonade stand before having actually bought the goddamn lemonade to sell.  Remember reading about the revolutionary war?  Some random stuff  * [The *Stamp Act of 1765*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stamp_Act_1765) * [The *Sugar Act* of 1733](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugar_Act) * [The *Boston Tea Party*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Tea_Party)  Are we going to start seeing police show up to shut down your garage sale (and possibly arrest you) because you didn't get a retail sales permit, are not paying minimum wage to any neighbors who might help you, or because technically your home is zoned as residential and not commercial?  There's a point where we have to sit down and recognize that this has gotten out of hand.  It is not unreasonable to have some sort of official permits and licensure for those who operate permanent ventures - restaurants, retail stores, and so on.  However, to seize the ability of private individuals to do private business on small scales such as this is ludicrous.    That being said, I realize the difficulty of coding something like this into law.  Maybe you write something into the code that puts some arbitrary limit on it, something that's easy to avoid at a lemonade stand or garage sale but hard to avoid in a non-failing business, e.g. $10,000 gross annual sales.  At that kind of volume it becomes the government's interest to perform its duty of protecting me from everybody else and everybody else from me.  I make a particularly good stir fry, and many of my friends enjoy it.  Sometimes I will make a deal where they pay me, say, $50 for time and materials to make up a batch that serves 10 people.  Should I obtain a city permit to do this?  What if I make it in one city and then deliver it to another (e.g., I live in Tampa but maybe I make one and bring it to my hometown of Jacksonville), in which city should I obtain the permit?  Both?  What steps are either of these municipalities then responsible for if things go badly?  You could carry this to logical extremes, but it makes no sense to do so -- when was the last time a lemonade stand was the vector for a major strain of foodborne illness?  Even then, is it the responsibility of the lemonade producer or the lemon producer?  At what point is it actually just enough?  Thinking this way is certainly not be abandoning my liberal viewpoints - how could wanting Johnny-down-the-street from having an equal chance with Minute Maid™ (a.k.a. Coca Cola) be any less true to such ideals?  I bring this up because I have seen it pointed out, with this event in particular, that it is a ""libertarian"" issue and not a progressive one.

t5_2qqom,rusty075,1314144365,"Andrew Skurka; Outdor Educator, general backcountry expert, on food storage:   &gt;**Sleeping with you food.** In areas with a low risk of bear incidents, and/or an area where no other food-protection technique is available (e.g. a tree-less alpine area), I often sleep with my food. If a bear were to enter my campsite, I at least have a ""fighting chance"" to protect my food. Black bears can often be scared off by throwing rocks and sticks at them. Grizzly bears are more likely to get angry and attack, so it's best to avoid this technique in grizzly habitat.          **Put your food in a tree.  If you can't put it in a tree, put it in an approved bear canister if you're in bear country. If you're not in bear country, keep your food where the animals can't get to it.  That *is* accepted outdoor etiquette and campcraft. **  Thanks for the Outdoor Educator™ explanation on why we shouldn't let animals get to your food...I don't think anyone was suggesting that.  Your food in a Ursack is no safer from a rodent than it is inside your tent.  I've seen mice chew right through them. You're giving them unfettered access to it for hours. If you leave your food outside where a rodent can attempt to get at it for hours, be it in an Ursack or in the hollow or a tree, you are teaching the animal to associate humans with the *possibility* of food, which is as bad as actually feeding them.  Keep your food with you, and A) their fear of you as a predator will discourage them from going after it, and B) your proximity will quickly stop any attempts.    I've hung my food from trees hundreds of nights, and had only the rare occasional incident of something trying to get into it.  I've kept my food in my tent or hammock with me maybe dozens of nights, and haven't seen any increase in the curiosity of the woodland creatures.           ",™
t5_2qqom,yy633013,1314145245,"I appreciate your rebuttal however I would love to see evidence of a rodent getting into an Ursack when the evidence of bear accessing them is slim, though has happened in defective models.   Also: &gt; I often sleep with my food. If a bear were to enter my campsite, I at least have a ""fighting chance"" to protect my food. Black bears can often be scared off by throwing rocks and sticks at them. Grizzly bears are more likely to get angry and attack, so it's best to avoid this technique in grizzly habitat  This is poor advice and I don't care what appeal to ethos or logos you use to validate his point. Anyone that says they would fight a bear off or attempt to do so in order to protect their food is, in my book, unfit to lead outdoor expeditions or teach courses. Regardless of what type of bear it is, you don't want to exacerbate the situation by keeping your food in close proximity to you.   If you want to keep doing it then by all means go ahead, unless I'm leading a trip you're on, I can't do anything to stop you. But when, not if, you do encounter a critter don't plead ignorance but rather remember this post.

t5_2qqjc,ropers,1314212791,"&gt; This is actually already happening in a way. Every manufacturer is designing their own proprietary 'signature' methods so that their devices can detect when they are connected to their chargers (and can draw as much current as they are designed to handle) or when they're connected to something else they see as a standard usb port (where they only draw up to 500mA of current).  Though similar, that sort of amounts to the opposite of what I tried to suggest: I tried to envisage a way for all chargers to be compatible with all devices while still allowing gadgets to draw power to their liking. What you describe sort of goes into the opposite direction, because it seems to be facilitating a *stronger* vendor lock-in, with third party chargers ending up not being fully compatible. It appears autosensing and/or handshaking between chargers can be used for both good and evil™.  &gt; There are some charging controller integrated circuits that try to implement more than one of these proprietary methods, essentially making this into a poorly planned ad hoc standard.  That's a bit more encouraging, but the problems of course are the propriatariness of and the ad-hoc-ness.",™

I didn't pay for the game, it was free with my gfx card. After asking several times for support, every suggestion was to download it again.   In my country, we pay for data. I'm on the cheapest plan there is, and after 5 attempts (8-10gb each time), I'd been charged over $50 for data.  The problems included the game not playing properly and crashing. I was told to buy a sound card as it was my motherboard's onboard sound being incompatible. It's an ASUS P7-P55DE, no cheapy.   Also, the game wouldn't stop downloading once it hit the end of the completion bar. I was told this was updates, but the bar said 100%, and it would go two gigs over that, sometimes three or four... never the same amount.  Also, the game would disappear from the account for weeks at a time, then reappear, then disappear...   When Origin came out, it asked me to re-register for the game from the beginning. Initially, it was a 45 minute process using game-cards, registering for accounts, and copying codes from emails they sent for verification- I think 3 accounts and 5 verification codes in all- and that was before I could start downloading the game.

(Disclosure: I'm andalusian) And about the separatists, well, as a supporter of True Democracy ®, so it'd be pretty cynical to want something other than a referendum. Let the Catalans vote. They want to ""leave""? So be it. Basque Country? Let 'em do whatever they want to do, heck. Personally, I'd find it a pity, just because I like them. But if that's really what they want, well they should be able to do it. If every Spaniard would think this way, I don't think there would be any ""problem"" to begin with.   And no, the nationalists [wouldn't lose any power](http://graficos.lainformacion.com/politica/elecciones-nacionales/como-quedaria-el-parlamento-espanol-con-un-sistema-proporcional-puro_31lRsuYscyRZjw6Jspgsm6/) without our *beloved* [D'Hondt method](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/D%27Hondt_method).",®

t5_2qhmr,verymaybe,1314301492,"So here's the rub. All these words like ""information"" and ""surprising"" are loaded in an ""how do you like dem' apples?"" sort of way.   Basically, *Information* in Information Theory is defined in a very strict way that excludes a bunch of things any reasonable human being would describe as ""information"".   By the definition, the amount of *Information* something contains is quantified by the possibilities it rules out.    If you know that my truck is a primary color, and then I tell you that it is ""red"". I've ruled out two options. This is a quantity of Information.    Along the same lines, I can say something like my truck is ""not blue"". This rules out one option, but doesn't tell you what color my truck is. I've given you some amount of Information, but less than if I told you what color my truck is.  If I then say my truck is ""not yellow"". This carries even more Information, and the sum total of Information in ""not blue"" and ""not yellow"" equals the information in flat out stating ""red"".  Now say I just tell you ""not blue"" &amp; ""not yellow"", and you do a little calculating in your head to figure out that my truck must be red. You haven't actually created any new information. That Information was already present in ""not blue"" &amp; ""not yellow"".  With computers, the options are 1 &amp; 0 so it's even simpler. If I read a random string of 1 and 0's to you over the phone, there's a surprisal factor with each digit. That is to say, you didn't know what it was going to be until I told you. With each 1 or 0 you write down, you eliminate the possibility of it being the other symbol and Information is created. This is signaling and the kind of thing Shannon was working on.   Inside a computer, the rules are deterministic, so there can't be surprise or Information created.   7 + 2  contains the same amount of Information as 7 + 2 = 9. Even if you do some work or computation to come up with that nine, the probability of the result being 9 was unity. You didn't rule out any other possible results by doing the work. It was always going to be 9.   So now you get into questions like, ""Well smarty pants, how did you CHOOSE 7 and 2""? Information must be created when you didn't select *other* number to add. But, that's sort of outside the scope. You can see how the fields overlap.   As an enclosed system though, a computer left to its own devices to crunch away, can perform calculations without creating Information.   Hopefully that helps. Mostly this is fussing over how you define the terms.     **Recommended Further reading about Information Theory:**  Shannon's papers, obviously.   For fun times and interesting things to impress babes at parties - ""The Information"" by James Gleick.  For Serious Business™ - ""Knowledge and the Flow of Information"" by Fred I. Dretske.  Dretske is actually interested in building a theory of Knowledge (capital K!!) and sort of wanders off to play with the philosophy department. He says interesting-but-hard-to-see-how-this-will-ever-come-in-useful things along the lines of: you can only KNOW I have a red truck *if I actually have one*. There is no way to Know Information about something that doesn't exist. *Dude...wait....what?*. But before he can even get to that, he has to give Information Theory a pretty firm dressing down, which he does. The whole book is neat, but definitely falls under ""Academic"".   ",™

t5_2sokd,ropers,1314318313,"You know how there are many, many different Linux distributions? This is kind of similar. Incidentally, a lot of the Protestant distributions in particular are very much based on the idea that the source code (the Bible text) is what really matters most, and that people ought to be able to get access to it. Protestant Christians wanted to be able to independently reverse engineer (interpret), compile (translate) and distribute the code (the Bible text). Of course, big-time semi-monopolist Christianity™ didn't see things like that and didn't think that end users should be allowed to do that. So for a long time, they burnt people who got caught with an unlicensed copy of source code at the stake. The irony of course is that these days, particularly in the US, traditionally Protestant denominations too often release their own binary packages (dogmatic ideas) from the source and expect every fellow Christian to buy into them, even though their binaries may be quite tainted and may be anything but born out by the plain source. There often is quite a bit of stuff compiled-in that really you wouldn't expect to be there if you just looked at the source. Maybe some of the companies who've now forked their own project and who've admitted that they're also working off an additional code base too (such as Mormons) are just more honest about compiling in their special features. So the Protestant denominations have in many ways gone at least as proprietary as the Microsofties and Apple fans of the Catholic and Orthodox churches.  Does that make sense?

t5_2r9vp,tiffums,1314346927,"The first time I did knife hits I was very, very new to smoking; it was approximately my third time getting high, ever. My boyfriend served me the hits, we left immediately after and headed out with a group of 7-8 similarly high/drunk friend to an improv comedy show on campus, just a few blocks away.      So, I take the hit, possibly take two or three. But I'm fine at first after some coughing, because even ice filtered those hits are damned hard on my noobish throat. I grab my coat, feeling a little tingly, and we all head outside. About thirty feet outside our dorm, I start having open-eye visuals so intense that I literally cannot see where I'm walking. The world is moving, shifting, multiplying, and changing color so rapidly that I clutch my boyfriend's arm for dear life. And just as if I were actually blind, he has to tell me when we get to a curb or an obstacle because I'm genuinely incapable of actually processing the sight of what's in front of me.  Time does not mean what it meant just ten minutes ago, and I'm pretty sure whomever determines that this meter is the same distance as that meter has similarly fucked off early for the day.   Walking these six blocks is rapidly becoming the most intense experience of my life. The lights, the many stores and restaurants that are bustling with people are all adding to the intensity of the tingling in my body and the visuals in front of me. A few blocks into the journey I see flashing blue and red and have just enough brainpower left to realize we are going to have to walk past a cop car. I clutch my boyfriend's arm to the point of leaving marks, because at this point I can't even focus my eyes on command, nevertheless converse coherently or try to pass for anything other than being incredibly, ridiculously stoned out of my everloving mind. The only thing right now that I know for certain is that the arm I'm clinging to is real, and that it's keeping me safe... (aside from those few early stumbles when I felt like those IMAX theaters where they drop the camera towards the ground at high speed and even though you're in a theater your brain still thinks you're going to die.) So, fairly safe. And somehow, we pass the cops without incident while I'm distracted by solving the universe.   By now, going up curbs feels like a ski-lift up a mountainside: a cold whooshing as you travel a long way up in a single bound. Going down reminds me of my favorite childhood water slide, and I'm pretty sure I'm even swinging gently from side to side gently as I *whooosh* down the curb, that single step feeling like it's lasting forever.   Eventually, we make it to the auditorium. Either the show is free or someone in the group pays the suggested donation price for me, because I am still incapable of reaching into my pocket to get my wallet. I am incapable of even processing whether or not this is even something I am expected to do.  I do manage the steps into the building on my own though. Or at least, I think I do. The boyfriend-arm is still tightly encircled by both of mine, though, because at this point I'm fairly sure our skins have melded into one entity, and it would hurt a lot to separate them. Besides, I don't want to and you can't make me. I have three arms now. Hah!  We sit down inside, and I am told I spend the next 15 minutes staring at the wall to the right of the stage and laughing softly to myself. They don't understand though, I say, because the wall isn't moving for *them* the way it's moving for *me*.  After another ten minutes I come down enough to actually process and hear snippits of the show, but what's happening inside my head is still better, so I retreat inwards, feeling like a snail withdrawing into a shell made of warm fluffy towels, straight from the dryer but not too hot. It's a nice feeling.   Later we make it back to the dorm, but we could have gotten there by tyrannosaurus-back for all I remember of the rest of the rest of the show and the evening. It was unquestionably, indisputably the highest I have ever been, and almost certainly the highest I will *ever* be.     I wasn't a [10], I wasn't even an [11] (Spinal Tap has nothing on me.) I was a solid [¥®¶].  And I dare any of you to tell me I wasn't tripping balls.   &lt;3  Edit: And I always did feel a special affinity with the (then) boyfriend's right arm after that night.",®

t5_2qhhk,BALTIM0R0N,1314450261,"From: ""How Stuff Works - How To Treat A Bleeding Dog""   http://animals.howstuffworks.com/pets/how-to-give-first-aid-to-your-dog3.htm  A dog's paws and legs are vulnerable to injury from broken glass, nails, and other sharp objects, and they will bleed heavily when cut. An injured ear will also bleed heavily because the skin over the ear is so thin.  With any bleeding injury, the main purpose of first aid is to prevent excessive blood loss, which can lead to shock. The signs of shock include pale or white gums, a rapid heartbeat, or rapid breathing. If any wound is spurting blood, it means an artery has been cut. This requires immediate professional attention.  How you tend to your dog will depend on the location and extent of the bleeding. The following dog care tips will help you apply first aid to various body areas.  Dog's Bleeding Head or Torso  Step 2 ©2006 Publications International, Ltd. Step 2  Step 1: Restrain the dog if necessary.  Step 1a: Approach the dog slowly, speaking in a reassuring tone of voice.  Step 1b: Slip a leash around the dog's neck, then place the leash around a fixed object. Pull the dog against this object and tie the leash so the dog cannot move its head.  Step 1c: Muzzle the dog to protect yourself.  Step 2: Cover the wound with a sterile gauze pad, clean folded towel, or sanitary napkin.  Step 3: Wrap torn rags or other soft material around the dressing and tie or tape it just tightly enough to hold the bandage in place.  Step 4: Transport the dog immediately to the veterinarian.  Dog's Bleeding Leg, Paw, or Tail  Step 1: Restrain the dog if necessary.  Step 3 ©2006 Publications International, Ltd. Step 3  Step 1a: Approach the dog slowly, speaking in a reassuring tone of voice.  Step 2: Clip the hair around the injured area.  Step 3: Examine the wound for glass or other foreign objects. If visible, remove the object with your fingers or a pair of tweezers. If the tissue under the wound appears to pass by when you move the skin, the wound will probably require stitches.  Step 4: Flush the wound thoroughly with clean water. Avoid home antiseptics, which may cause pain when applied.  Step 5: Cover the wound with a clean cloth, sterile dressing, or sanitary napkin.  Step 6: Place your hand over the dressing and press firmly.  Step 8 ©2006 Publications International, Ltd. Step 8  Step 7: Keep pressure on the dressing to stop bleeding. If blood soaks through the dressing, DO NOT remove it. Apply more dressing and continue to apply pressure until the bleeding stops. If the bleeding does not stop within 5 minutes, continue to apply pressure on the wound while transporting the dog to the veterinarian.  Step 8: Wrap torn rags or other soft material around the dressing and tie or tape it just tightly enough to keep the bandage on. Start below the wound and wrap upward.  Step 9: If the wound is deep enough to require stitches, keep the dog off the injured leg, and immediately transport your pet to the veterinarian.  Dog's Bleeding Chest or Abdomen  Step 1: Restrain the dog if necessary.  Step 1a: Approach the dog slowly, speaking in a reassuring tone of voice.  Step 1b: Muzzle the dog to protect yourself.  Step 2: If the wound is in the chest and a ""sucking"" noise is heard, bandage the wound tightly enough to keep air from entering, and transport the dog immediately to the veterinarian. If not, proceed to Step 3.  Step 3 ©2006 Publications International, Ltd. Step 3  Step 3: If there is a protruding object, such as an arrow, DO NOT attempt to remove the object. If not, proceed to Step 4.  Step 3a: Place clean cloths, sterile dressings, or sanitary napkins around the point of entry.  Step 3b: Bandage tightly around the point of entry.  Step 3c: Transport the dog immediately to the veterinarian.  Step 4: Clip the hair around the injured area.  Step 5: Examine the wound for glass or other foreign objects. If visible, remove the object with your fingers or a pair of tweezers. If the tissue under the wound appears to pass by when you move the skin, the wound will probably require stitches.  Step 6: Flush the wound thoroughly with clean water.  Step 7: Cover the wound with a clean cloth, sterile dressing, or sanitary napkin.  Step 10 ©2006 Publications International, Ltd. Step 10  Step 8: Place your hand over the dressing and press firmly.  Step 9: Keep pressure on the dressing to stop the bleeding. If blood soaks through the dressing, DO NOT remove it. Apply more dressing and continue to apply pressure until the bleeding stops.  Step 10: Wrap torn sheets or other soft material around the dressing and tie or tape it just tightly enough to keep the bandage on.  Step 11: If the wound is deep enough to require stitches, transport the dog immediately to the veterinarian.  Dog's Bleeding Ear  Step 1: Restrain the dog if necessary.  Step 2 ©2006 Publications International, Ltd. Step 2  Step 1a: Approach the dog slowly, speaking in a reassuring tone of voice.  Step 1b: Muzzle the dog to protect yourself.  Step 2: Cover the wound with a clean cloth, sterile dressing, or sanitary napkin. Place dressing material on both sides of the ear flap, then fold it over the top of the dog's head and hold firmly to control bleeding.  Step 3: Wrap torn sheets or rags around the dressing, ear, and head, making sure the entire ear is covered. Tape or tie the bandage in place.  Step 4: Transport the dog immediately to the veterinarian.  Dog's Bleeding Nails  A broken nail or one that is cut too short are the most common reasons for a bleeding nail. Be sure to bring your dog to the groomer if you're not comfortable clipping its nails.  If the nail is broken:  Step 1: Restrain the dog if necessary.  Step 1a: Approach the dog slowly, speaking in a reassuring tone of voice.  Step 3 ©2006 Publications International, Ltd. Step 3  Step 2: DO NOT try to cut or remove the broken nail without muzzling the dog.  Step 3: Hold a clean cloth, sterile dressing, or sanitary napkin against the nail. The bleeding will stop in a few minutes.  Step 4: Transport the dog to the veterinarian as soon as possible.  If the nail is cut too short:  Step 1: Restrain the dog if necessary.  Step 1a: Approach the dog slowly, speaking in a reassuring tone of voice.  Step 1b: Slip a leash around the dog's neck, then place the leash around a fixed object. Pull the dog against this object and tie the leash so the dog cannot move its head.  Step 1c: Muzzle the dog to protect yourself.  Step 2: Hold a clean cloth, sterile dressing, or sanitary napkin against the nail.  Step 3: Keep firm pressure on the area for at least 5 minutes. DO NOT remove the bandage until the bleeding stops.  Step 4: If the bleeding does not stop in 15 to 20 minutes, transport the dog to the veterinarian as soon as possible. Continuous bleeding indicates a bleeding disorder that should be treated promptly.  Internal Bleeding  Internal bleeding is always an emergency. The signs of internal bleeding are pale or white gums; rapid heartbeat or breathing; and bleeding from the ears, nose, mouth, or rectum. The following steps will help you treat the dog for any potential shock, and transport the dog to professional help immediately.  Step 1: If there is bleeding from any external wounds, treat for shock.  Step 1a: Examine the gums by gently lifting the upper lip so the gum is visible. Pale or white gums indicate the dog is almost certainly in shock and may have serious internal injuries and/or bleeding. If the gums are pink, the dog is probably not in shock.  Step 1b: Determine the heartbeat. Place your fingers firmly on the dog about 2 inches behind the dog's elbow in the center of its chest. Count the number of beats in 10 seconds and multiply by 6. If the dog is in shock its heartbeat may be more than 150 beats per minute.  Step 3 ©2006 Publications International, Ltd. Step 3  Step 2: Place the dog on its side with its head extended.  Step 3: Gently pull out the dog's tongue to keep the airway open.  Step 4: Elevate the dog's hindquarters slightly by placing them on a pillow or folded towels.  Step 5: To conserve body heat, wrap the dog in a blanket or jacket.  Step 6: Transport the dog immediately to the veterinarian.",©

Now what's the common link? The   &gt;  deliberate and systematic extermination of a national, racial, political, or cultural group.      Nothing close to that is happening in Israel (as much as ggbesq would like to have you believe it, given that he's part of the supposedly oppressed group and has been known for inciting baseless conspiracy theories here on reddit). In fact, the relative proportion of the population of Arabs/Muslims/{whatever else ethnic group you think is being culled} is *rising* in Israel proper compared to most other segments (for the record, the main group surpassing them are the Orthodox Jews, which most Israelis hate.) Populations in Gaza/{West Bank} are also sharply on the rise. (Who'd have thought that a country which almost surely has nukes would be so bad at exterminating people that they do it at a negative rate?)      &gt; BUT MAYBE THEY'RE JUST DOING IT SLOWLY SO THE REST OF THE WORLD DOESN'T NOTICE LOL?      Good question (though it wasn't really a question), but if you consider the militant/civilian casualty ratio of the operations in Gaza, you'd notice that Israeli military strikes are collectively among the most precise set of operations that *any* country has ever accomplished in the history of modern Guerilla warfare (unfortunately for the militants, actually, as they actively hide among the population in hopes of having their fellow Gazans killed for the sake of PR). Unless you're ready to label effectively every asymmetric conflict since the late 1800s as a ""genocide"", you're being a hypocritical shit ☺.",☺

It's kind of obvious, but we miss it because we're so caught up in the day-to-day context of our singular lives.  So I find it easy to see that our planet is probably alive, not necessarily sentient, because it's a system that perpetuates itself in spite of the laws of entropy, which is the definition of life as I have come to understand it. Our planet has lungs, an interchange of nutrients, and as demonstrated by the Gulf of Mexico disaster, a very active circulatory system.

You should argue that you can have belief without knowledge but you can't have knowledge without belief. You could then argue that since belief is a requirement of knowledge it **is** a middle ground between the extremes of knowledge of gods and knowledge of no gods.  Now allow me to demonstrate how you **can** have knowledge without belief:  A detective finds DNA evidence that exonerates a suspect. The detective was so sure that the suspect was guilty that even while he knows propositionally that the suspect is innocent he doesn't believe it. He still feels in his gut that the suspect is guilty. Again, he **knows** the suspect is innocent in a propositional sense but he **believes** the exact opposite in an intuitive way. He lacks propositional belief specifically because of his intuitive belief.  I've encountered this exact kind of cognitive dissonance with theists. They know that evolution is true because of the overwhelming evidence but they believe God Did IT™. They have a propositional knowledge they do not believe because they hold a belief in the exact opposite direction.

The alternative, of course is embodied in ""Woman in White"" from the End of Time, who despite playing a fairly large part in the two-part serial, is never really explained. Who is she? How is she important to the Doctor? How can she seemingly slip in and out of the Time-Lock? How does she know so much? None of these were answered in-show, so no one was really able to be disappointed.  With River Song, however, after years of build-up, the answers to her questions were *never* going to match people's grand, amazing expectations.  Really, the best comparison to this whole furore over the River Song Revelations™ is the fan-reaction to Tom Baker's '77 serial *The Deadly Assassin*. Prior to this serial, the Time Lords were seen as all-powerful, awe-inspiring, immortal beings, capable of imprisoning planets forever in force fields, acting as the defenders of truth and good.   However, *The Deadly Assassin* showed them in a far less flattering light. Suddenly, they were all petty, mortal, squabbling, feeble-minded, doddering old fools. ""**WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO THE MAGIC OF DOCTOR WHO?**"" people cried, ""**WHERE HAS ALL THE MYSTERY GONE?**"" Fandom expectation, built up by over 7 years of Time Lord mystery, was completely shattered.  Sadly, inflated expectations are par for the course with a show like Doctor Who. With nearly 50 years of mythology to deal with, people are always going to get overly excited about upcoming revelations.   If we were to ever find out the Doctor's true name, for instance, I don't think that even the writing powers of Russell T. Davies, Steven Moffat and (the late) Robert Holmes *combined* would ever be able to match fandom's expectations.   That is the curse of Doctor Who.",™

New American Standard Bible (©1995) but emptied Himself, taking the form of a bond-servant, and being made in the likeness of men.  The key is the emptying of Himself. He chose to let go of some of His divine attributes, or denied them. He veiled His glory, accepted the limits of human nature, and chose to forego without His divine attributes while man.   Do not forget the apostles performed miracles as well, in the name of God.   I have no problem envisioning a Christ who was man. Imagine being filled with the Holy Spirit, overflowing within you, and having a mind and heart solely for God. You would be getting closer to Christ in a lot of ways.

A full hard drive is a slow hard drive. You can burn the files to CDs or DVDs, too, if you don't have an external hard drive.  * Keep the software updated. You can click on the little Apple logo in the top left corner, then click ""Software Update..."" and it will check if there is an update for you. It will also check automatically every so often, just in case you forget :)  * Don't forget to close programs when you are not using them. On Macs pressing the red X won't close the whole program. Any program on your dock (bottom bar) with a blue dot under it is open. Right-click the icon and click ""Close"" to fully close it.  Having a lot of programs open at once can slow down your computer.  * Like MySuperLove said, try not to overheat your laptop. Macs can get VERY warm, so try to only use them on a hard surface (like a table or a desk.) You *can* use it on your bed, but it will get very hot and it's not good for it. I bought a [lap-desk](http://www.walmart.com/ip/LapGear-Auburn-Tigers-Lap-Desk/16904515) so that I could use it on my lap or my bed without worrying about it.  * Keep an eye on the battery. If within the first year the battery is not lasting as long as it used to, or it is actually bulging (mine did this...) take it back to Apple/the store you bought it and they will replace it for you. This goes for any problem you have with the computer within the first year. As long as the damage wasn't caused by you (say, if you spilled water on it, or dropped it, or left it in a car overnight in the winter), Apple will fix it. If you can't get to the store you can submit your problem online at [Apple's website](http://www.apple.com/support/contact/).  * Like hurbaga said, be careful what you download. Most computer viruses out there are out to attack Windows PCs, but as Macs become more popular, so will viruses that are out to attack Macs. Viruses are bad! You do not want them, so be careful of downloads and know what you're getting.  If I think of more I'll add onto this, or make another comment :) Hope you enjoy your Mac!

t5_6,dementiatoday,1314737865,"**What is Dementia?**  Dementia is not a specific disease; it is a collection of symptoms that can be caused by a number of disorders, including neurodegenerative disease. The term “dementia” describes a progressive decline in memory or other cognitive functions that interferes in the ability to perform your usual daily activities (driving, shopping, balancing a checkbook, working, communicating, etc.).   The deterioration is more than might be expected from normal aging and is due to damage or disease. While dementia often includes memory loss, memory loss by itself does not mean that you have dementia.  Dementia is caused by various diseases and conditions that result in damaged brain cells or connections between brain cells. When making a diagnosis of dementia, physicians commonly refer to the criteria given in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV).  To meet DSM-IV criteria for dementia, the following are required:  Symptoms must include decline in memory and in at least one of the following cognitive abilities:  * Ability to generate coherent speech or understand spoken or written language; * Ability to recognize or identify objects, assuming intact sensory function; * Ability to execute motor activities, assuming intact motor abilities, sensory function and comprehension of the required task * Ability to think abstractly, make sound judgments and plan and carry out complex tasks.  The decline in cognitive abilities must be severe enough to interfere with daily life.  **How Common Is Dementia?**  Approximately 3.4 million individuals aged 71 and older in the United States have dementia (reference), and an estimated 5.3 million Americans of all ages have Alzheimer’s disease (reference). While a number of different diseases can cause dementia, Alzheimer’s disease is the most common cause in older adults.   Some other diseases that cause dementia include frontotemporal dementia, stroke (vascular dementia) and dementia with Lewy bodies. For people who are age 65 and older with a degenerative dementia, the most common disorders are Alzheimer’s disease and vascular dementia. In people who are under 65, frontotemporal dementia and Huntington’s disease are also common. The damage caused by each of these diseases creates a typical pattern of cognitive loss due to the areas of the brain impacted by the underlying disease.  Dementia caused by nervous system disease, especially Alzheimer’s disease, is increasing in frequency more than most other types of dementia. Some researchers suspect that as many as half of all people over 80 years old develop Alzheimer’s disease. Also, the increased incidence of AIDS dementia complex, which results from HIV infection, helps account for the increased dementia in recent history, although with the invention of newer and better drugs to treat HIV, the occurrence of AIDS-associated dementia is declining.    Researchers have also found that two nervous diseases, which were originally incorrectly diagnosed as Alzheimer’s, are emerging as major causes of dementia: Lewy body disease and Pick’s disease.  **Who Gets Dementia?**  Dementia is considered a late-life disease because it tends to develop mostly in elderly people. About 5% to 8% of all people over the age of 65 have some form of dementia, and this number doubles every five years above that age. It is estimated that as many as half of people in their 80s suffer from dementia.   Some cases of dementia are caused by medical conditions that can be treated, fully or partly restoring mental function. When dementia cannot be reversed, the goal of treatment is to make life as easy as possible for the person and the caregivers.  **Which Dementias Are Treatable?**  It is important for a physician to determine the cause of memory loss or other dementia-like symptoms. Some symptoms can be reversed if they are caused by treatable conditions, such as depression, delirium, drug interaction, thyroid problems, excess use of alcohol or certain vitamin deficiencies.  * Dementia due to long-term substance abuse. * Tumors that can be removed. * Subdural hematoma, accumulation of blood beneath the outer covering of the brain is the result of a broken blood vessel, usually the result of a head injury. * Normal-pressure hydrocephalus. * Metabolic disorders, such as a vitamin B12 deficiency. * Hypothyroidism, a condition that results from an underactive thyroid. * Hypoglycemia, a condition that results from low blood sugar.  **What Are Some of the Untreatable Causes of Dementia?**  When dementia is not caused by treatable conditions, a physician must conduct further assessments to identify the form of dementia that is causing symptoms. Different types of dementia are associated with distinct symptom patterns and distinguishing microscopic brain abnormalities.  * Alzheimer’s disease. * Multi-infarct dementia (Dementia due to multiple small strokes). * Dementias associated with Parkinson’s disease and similar disorders. * AIDS dementia complex. * Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a quickly progressing and fatal disease that consists of dementia and muscle twitching and spasm.  **Citation**  WebMD Medical Reference from Healthwise Last Updated: June 17, 2009 This information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor.

t5_2qh1i,highguy420,1314762149,"Fair enough, in your mind it is a faulty comparison.  I'm glad you shared.  My dad works at monsanto and says that GM crops are superior to the way nature has done things for thousands of years despite evidence to the contrary.  Your ""dad"" as you put it, is ignoring the obvious facts, or has not done the research himself and is trusting a biased opinion.  I'm guessing he is not a cannabis researcher for the Mayo Clinic.  The researchers that actually do study this have shown that THC, including the synthetic substance included in dronobanol (Marinol®), by itself is not as effective as the complete plant, or a more complete extract including multiple cannabinoids.  He would know that if he actually ever researched it.  But he hasn't, and, like the rest of us, is suffering from confirmation bias.  Let me ask my mechanic what he thinks of zero-clearance hinges for my kitchen remodel... it's all mechanical shit anyway, cars are no different than cabinets.  The statement is about ability, not alacrity.  If you can sink 60 free-throws in a row, without missing once, in one minute sober, and it takes 61 seconds to do high, you still just sank 60 free-throws in a row.  Sure, it took you, on average, a bit longer, but your ability to do 60 free throws in a row was not inhibited.  The report that comes from is in relationship to driving in a simulator, so I think the scientists would have said something more direct if the amount of time was significant enough to actually affect driving safety ... as that was the entire purpose of the study.  So now we are going to argue the definition of ""success""?  Hah.  Good one.    I understand that you want to understand my perspective, but you have to realize that you have grown up in a society where everyone around you has been told lies for so long they actually believe them.  You grew up in a society that had already been indoctrinated for over twenty years to believe that cannabis, one of the safest and most beneficial plants known to humans, is somehow able to destroy society, let alone a person's life.    The only thing that the prohibition of cannabis, or any drug for that matter, accomplishes is to allow the government to control our personal choices.  That is it.  It does not protect society.  It does not protect a drug addict from themselves, it does NOTHING but undermine our freedom from the prying eyes and violent intervention of the government.    There is no reason a plant should be illegal.  End of story.  If someone uses that plant to hurt someone that action should be illegal.  If I extract cyanide from apple seeds and kill someone then that would be called murder.  If I extract cocaine from coca leaves and ingest it the only harmed party is myself.  If I then kill someone on a ""drug induced psychotic episode"" then that would be murder.  Punishing someone for possession or use of any psychoactive substance is preemptive punishment.   To try and prohibit every single harmful substance is a laughable goal. What about pencils?  Bicycles?  Swimming pools?  When will it be actually illegal to run with scissors?  Each of those things kill more people daily than marijuana has killed in the entire time since the first mammal discovered that the plant produces chemicals that activate some receptors in their brain, let alone the first human being cultivated the cannabis plant for spiritual, medicinal or recreational use.   I'm not saying that there should not be assistance available if someone wants to quit using it, just like there should be assistance available to someone who wants to quit any life-altering habit, such as overeating, uncontrolled sexual urges, pokemon, biting your nails, etc.  If a habit is harmful to you, or those around you, and you want to find help, then you should be able to find help for that problem.  The point is that it is not a matter for the courts.  If your family, your friends, and especially if you find that any habit, drugs or otherwise, is causing negative life consequences then that is a matter for your family, friends and most importantly yourself to address.  There is no reason, short of you committing actual crimes, that the court should be involved in your personal affairs.  It is a waste of resources, plain and simple.  So, the issue is not so much a matter of cannabis being a harmless plant, which it is as much as ebay.com or eclairs are ""not a danger to society"", instead it is a matter of the entire concept of prohibiting it being absurd and contrary to the foundational concepts upon which this country was built.  The thing that makes cannabis dangerous is the prohibition.  Remove prohibition and you will find that cannabis is safe and beneficial to society in many, many ways.  Anyone who tells you otherwise wants your money, your freedom or both.   edit: found a few typos, should have proofread. ",®

Its unique vegetarian formulation, high in polyunsaturated fatty acids and low in saturated fatty acids, assists cardiovascular and circulatory efficiency. Additionally, it promotes the growth of beneficial friendly bacteria within the digestive system, and its unique shape and texture assists dental hygiene through the abrasive action required to chew, crunch and grind. Supreme® Science Selective Rat contains 100% natural ingredients including apple, known for its antioxidant benefits and blackcurrant, an excellent source of natural vitamins.  &gt; Ingredients and Nutritional values to come.  &gt; **[Burgess Supa Rat](http://www.burgesspetcare.co.uk/shop/suparat.html)**  &gt; Suparat Rat Royale is a Suparatastic all-in-one meal created especially for your pet rats. Each delicious nugget contains the perfect combination of vitamins, minerals and nutrients.  &gt; And the nuggets prevent selective feeding – unlike a muesli-style food where rats can pick out some bits and leave the rest, leading to an imbalanced diet. Suparat Rat Royale provides a tasty, balanced, healthy diet with added minerals to help maintain beautiful coat colour, and prebiotics to encourage friendly bacteria for a healthy digestion.  &gt; Ingredients: Wheat, Maize, Peas, Beet Pulp, Soya, Chicken Meal, Poultry Fat, Monocalcium Phosphate, Salt, Fructo-oligosaccharides (0.3%), Methionine.  &gt; Nutritional Values &gt; Fibre 3.5% &gt; Protein 16% &gt; Oil 6%  &gt; **[Pets at Home Rat Nuggets](http://www.petsathome.com/shop/nugget-rat-food-1kg-by-pets-at-home-15668)**  &gt; Nugget Food for Rats by Pets at Home is a complementary rat food containing a balance of ingredients providing:-  &gt; o Vitamins;   &gt; o Minerals;   &gt; o Fibre;   &gt; o Chicken Protein;   &gt; o Profeed - boosts your rat’s digestion and general health.    &gt; Rats, just like us can be fussy eaters and can be prone to eating only the parts of a traditional muesli food that they like, which can result in your rat not receiving a balanced diet. Pets at Home Rat Food Nuggets are a great choice, with all the essential nutrition of a muesli food blended into one tasty nugget.  &gt; Ingredients:  &gt; Wheat, Maize, Peas, Soya, Chicken Meal, Poultry Fat, Dicalcium Phosphate, Fructo-Oligosaccharides   &gt; Typical Analysis: &gt; Moisture 9%, Protein 16%, Oils and Fats 4.5%, Fibre 3.5%, Ash 4%  &gt; **[BEAPHAR CARE PLUS RAT](http://www.seapets.co.uk/products/pet-supplies/pet-food/rat-food/beaphar-care-plus-rat-700g.html)**  &gt; The Beaphar Care+ range is the first, totally complete, super premium food available for the small pet, offering the highest possible quality and formulation known to man. The high quality proteins and Omega 3 and 6 fatty acids ensures that an animal will have a healthy and long life with out experiencing the diseases caused by nutritional deficiencies. The foods also contain prebiotics and Yucca extracts and the chelated minerals improve absorption and supply to the body.

t5_2qmvj,yorugua,1314819603,"Del Observador:      © El Observador  El fiscal Diego Pérez pidió a la Justicia el procesamiento con prisión del ex intendente Mariano Arana, de la ex secretaria general de la comuna María Julia Muñoz y del ex director municipal Alberto Rosselli. Luego de dos años de investigación que incluyó el testimonio de 60 personas y ocho careos, el magistrado concluyó que los ex jerarcas fueron responsables de dos de los tres delitos que le imputó a Juan Carlos Bengoa y que terminaron con el director de Casinos tras las rejas: delito continuado de fraude y de concusión. También solicitó a la jueza Fanny Canessa que se los procese por un delito continuado de abuso de funciones.  A juicio del fiscal, los superiores a  Bengoa, a pesar de su intento por negarlo, estaban al tanto de las maniobras llevadas adelante por el responsable de los casinos municipales.  Por este caso también fueron procesados en diciembre de 2007 los ex asesores de Bengoa, Orestes González y José Luis Antúnez, el ex funcionario municipal Gustavo Dalmonte y el empresario Felipe Ruiz. Fundamentalmente la Justicia los responsabilizó por el cambio de estrategia de negocios por la que se pasó de comprar a arrendar máquinas tragamonedas para los casinos municipales, con pérdidas millonarias para la Intendencia y ganancias para los empresarios.  Además, todas las empresas que pusieron US$ 270 mil para la refacción de obras en el Casino Parque Hotel resultaron seleccionadas por la IMM para arrendar directamente slots.  Fraude y concusión A juicio del fiscal Pérez, resultó clave para pedir coautoría de estos delitos una nota que figura en el expediente de agosto de 2002, en la que Bengoa informa a sus jerarcas de la nueva estrategia de negocios basada en el arrendamiento de tragamonedas.  Si bien los ex jerarcas municipales aseguraron que nada sabían de las decisiones tomadas por Bengoa, a juicio de la Fiscalía esa nota confirma que conocían la maniobra, y que cooperaron con ella en perjuicio de la administración. En esa nota, Bengoa también menciona la refacción del Casino Parque Hotel y la licitación que se llevaría a cabo posteriormente. De ahí devendría, a juicio del fiscal, la coautoría del delito de concusión. El fiscal entendió que los jerarcas favorecieron la estrategia por la cual quienes pusieron dinero en la “colecta” para las obras del Parque Hotel luego salieron beneficiados con la contratación directa.  A lo largo de la indagatoria judicial, Arana, Muñoz y Rosselli insistieron en que desconocían las obras. Arana declaró en marzo de 2009 –en el careo con Bengoa– que se enteró de las obras poco antes de la inauguración y que desconocía que se hubieran llevado a cabo con la colaboración de los empresarios. Además, definió esa obra como “minúscula” con relación a otras y que por lo tanto no se trató en las reuniones que el intendente mantiene con sus directores.  Abuso de funciones El fiscal Pérez quiere que se los procese, es decir, que se los investigue por un nuevo presunto delito: abuso de funciones. Pérez entiende que hay dos resoluciones adoptadas por Arana, con participación de Muñoz y Rosselli, que confirman  que ordenaron actos arbitrarios en perjuicio de la IMM. La primera es la adjudicación de dos máquinas marca Sigma Japón con una ganancia del 50% para el empresario Carlos Mautone, titular de esas máquinas. Mautone fue el único empresario que no puso dinero para la colecta.  Según el fiscal, quedó probado que Bengoa no tuvo participación en la asignación de esas máquinas. La resolución fue firmada por Muñoz. Luego se supo que Mautone se reunió con Arana y el intendente le ofreció esa ganancia.  Esa resolución de diciembre de 2001 lleva también la firma de Rosselli. En ese momento Bengoa no había asumido la responsabilidad de los casinos, cargo que desempeñó a partir de 2002.  La Fiscalía señaló como parte del abuso de funciones la decisión de la IMM de aumentar las ganancias al Hotel Oceanía en 10%, que debían ser entregadas a Carmitel.  Durante el careo con Muñoz, Bengoa declaró que la IMM negoció con Carmitel para que retirara el recurso que presentó contra la instalación de la sala de juegos en el Oceanía. Bengoa, acompañado del secretario de Arana, Mario Areán, negoció ese incremento con el titular del Oceanía, Everly Rodríguez. Según Bengoa, lo hicieron a pedido de Arana, pero éste lo negó.",©
