Copyright © 1993 by Absolute Multimedia. http://www.frankdoris.com/writing/tas/gratefuldead.htm  &gt;The other night I experienced the finest large-scale High-End audio system I have ever heard. It shattered my preconceived notions of what the state-of-the-art in High End sound reproduction is capable of.  &gt;This system was clean from fewer than five Hertz (according to its designer) to beyond the range of human hearing. Never at any time did I hear distortion. The stereo imaging was pinpoint and extremely accurate, with no bunching, ""hole-in-the-middle,"" or problems at the extreme left and right. (This was accomplished with no room treatment whatsoever.) The tonal balance was almost without flaw (though the highs were slightly too prominent at close range), simply that of the instruments it was reproducing, especially drums, cymbals (which were reproduced with a purity which had to be heard to be believed), and gongs. Its reproduction of the lowest bass was unparalleled—the bass from the Infinity IRS woofers is feeble by comparison. The same can be said about this system's dynamic capability: It could reproduce a clean 120 dB at distance of over 50 feet. Soundstaging? The depth was almost perfectly accurate compared to the locations of the instruments on the stage, and the speakers were capable of generating width in excess of 100 feet. There was an excellent balance of direct-to-hall sound.  &gt;It was easy to see the instruments on the stage. Not ""see"" the instruments, see them. Most important, the emotional connection between the listener and the music—the ability to convey the emotion and feeling inherent in a musical performance being the measure of a truly great High End system—in my opinion was absolute, total, complete.  &gt;The stereo to which I am referring is the Grateful Dead concert sound reinforcement system, heard at the Nassau Coliseum in Long Island, New York.

t5_2qh33,Teotwawki69,1322723175,"Probably the only cases in which ""fair use'"" would cover quoting the entire work would be in a review of haiku or other very short poems. However, in that case, the form of the work -- a critique, literary criticism, non-fiction book about the author of the poem -- would invoke fair use and, in the case of the book, there'd be a little copyright notice up front saying, ""'Herp Derp Poem' © 1947 Edna St. Vincent Price, used with permission,"" and your publisher would have damn well gotten written permission first. Or would get sued later.  By the way, I don't know why you're throwing around the term ""monopoly"" in the context of copyright law, where it doesn't really apply. A monopoly would indicate someone who had gained exclusive distribution rights over a commodity that is not otherwise exclusive owned -- usually commodities like fuel, corn, coal, wheat, cotton, etc. Since a copyrighted work is, by definition, exclusive to the original copyright holders, no monopoly can be granted because the copyright excludes anyone else from the possibility of distributing that work without the permission of the owner. Granting an author a monopoly would look like this: only books by JK Rowling can be sold at Borders. No other authors allowed.  Or maybe that fifty mile wide distinction is too subtle for you.",©

The Church executed and terrorized more than a few scientists in their day, generally for standing against the Church's own Empirical views. (can you even call it Science when they were willing to persecute people who put forward theories incompatible with theirs?)  They just have a habit of re-branding the actual reasons for trials up until they apologize for it 200 years down the line.  Their current stance on Giordano Bruno and Tommaso Campanella for example is that they were persecuted for practicing magic and holding heretical views when in reality Tommaso's main issue was opposing the outdated (yet well-beloved by the Church) teachings of Aristotle and Bruno's was being an open well-known proponent of Heliocentrism, proposed that the Sun was one of many Stars and that there was thus the possibility of alien life more than 30 years before Galileo was forced to recant.   Ratzinger actually was in charge of putting together an apology for John Paul II called ""The Church and the Faults of the Past: Memory in the Service of Reconciliation"" looking into if there were more cases were they maybe should ""re-interpet"" what happened. (naturally not the Church's actions as the Church is never wrong, only apologizing for those poor misguided souls working all on their own who may have mistakenly believed they were doing God's Work™)",™

Reasons why we do things other than love are sins (or perhaps neutral, but you can usually tell the difference because there is often conflict with sin).  So for instance, back in the day™ it may have been a loving thing or perhaps a neutral thing to have 8 kids or so. However, today we know that there is a growing problem with overpopulation this creates a conflict for those who want to have 8 kids.

t5_2qhbp,kak0,1322765481,"It is from sunnipath, the link that azeenab gave with sh. hajj jibreel haddad  read to the bottom:   http://qa.sunnipath.com/issue_view.asp?HD=7&amp;ID=4604&amp;CATE=1 ` Our Mother A'isha's Age At The Time Of Her Marriage to The Prophet Answered by Shaykh Gibril F Haddad   Question:  To begin with, I think it is the responsibility of all those who believe that marrying a girl as young as nine years old was an accepted norm of the Arab culture, to provide at least a few examples to substantiate their point of view. I have not yet been able to find a single dependable instance in the books of Arab history where a girl as young as nine years old was given away in marriage. Unless such examples are given, we do not have any reasonable grounds to believe that it really was an accepted norm.  Answer:  In the name of Allah, Most Compassionate, Most Merciful,  - Abu Tughlub ibn Hamdan married the daughter of `Izz al-Dawla Bakhtyar when she was three and paid a dowry of 100,000 dinars. This took place in Safar 360 H. (Ibn al-Athir, al-Kamil).  ... snip many paragraphs  ...  Nowhere does Ibn Hisham say this.  This shows that Ayesha accepted Islam during the first year of Islam. While, if the narrative of Ayesha's marriage at seven years of age is held to be true, Ayesha should not have been born during the first year of Islam.  Rather, Ibn Hisham lists `A'isha among ""those that accepted Islam because of Abu Bakr."" This does not mean that she embraced Islam during the first year of Islam. Nor does it mean that she necessarily embraced Islam before `Umar (year 6) although she was born the previous year (year 7 before the Hijra) although it is understood she will automatically follow her father's choice even before the age of reason.  ... snip many paragraphs  ...  According to Ibn Hajar, Fatimah was five years older than Ayesha. Fatimah is reported to have been born when the Prophet was 35 years old. Thus, even if this information is taken to be correct, Ayesha could by no means be less than 14 years old at the time of hijrah, and 15 or 16 years old at the time of her marriage.   ... snip many paragraphs  ...   These are some of the major points that go against accepting the commonly known narrative regarding Ayesha's (ra) age at the time of her marriage. In my opinion, neither was it an Arab tradition to give away girls in marriage at an age as young as nine or ten years, nor did the Prophet marry Ayesha at such a young age. The people of Arabia did not object to this marriage, because it never happened in the manner it has been narrated.  Those that itch to follow misguidance always resort to solipsisms because they are invariably thin on sources. In this particular case ""the Learner"" proves to be ignorant and dishonest. It is no surprise he moves on every single point, without exception, from incorrect premises to false conclusions.  Hajj Gibril     MMVIII © Qibla.

That's all.  ---  On Love: The fact that you (and many if not all) think that these ""misfires"" are good is in my opininon evidence of my point. I think it would be odd for a group who thought slavery was fine and dandy and in fact were benefiting wonderfully from it either directly or indirectly to ever think that it was a ""bad"" thing and yet we see it happen all over, almost universally as societies progress. Also, I'm going to make the case that a society with slavery actually outperforms a society without it. The United States was, largely, built on slavery and now that the US has abolished it and is working to abolish its replacement (wage slavery) it is beginning to fall by the wayside. Incidentally, the growing nations (India and China) still have wage slavery and in fact actual slavery in many instances.  I came up with an interesting theory that women are guiding the species into morality. Since morality typically favors the protection of the weak, defenseless, and (let's face it) cute and or beautiful things in the world. Back in the day™ women were often mistreated: raped, killed, abused, etc. Naturally, they don't like this kind of thing and so would choose partners who would be AND raise their children to be nice to them and to others who were defenseless, weak, cute, and beautiful just like them. Note that when I'm saying women are weak and defenseless I mean physically and on average. Unfortunately this doesn't touch on everything, but it's an interesting thought.",™

t5_2qh1i,EvilMisogynist,1322788952,"I have a question for you gals: you're big on equality, or at least claim to be. Why is it acceptable for women to reject men for not conforming to traditional masculine gender roles, but it is unacceptable for men to reject women for not conforming to traditional feminine gender roles? For example, if a woman rejects a man because he isn't confident enough, most women will defend her choice, and if a socially anxious man dares to vent his bitterness, he is derisively referred to as a ""Nice Guy®"" and accused of being a misogynist, but if a man rejects a woman because she is too promiscuous, these same women will criticize this man's preferences as being retrograde and illiberal, and if a ""sexually liberated"" woman complains about this, she is coddled and treated like a victim.  Don't misunderstand me. I'm not naive. No amount of egalitarian guilt-tripping is going to undo millions of years of evolution.

t5_2t4zh,Robin_Claassen,1322831726,"“Rule 4: If a referee appointed by the tournament organizers feels she or he they can reasonably conclude after a review of all available evidence that he or she feels would help them make their determination that any member of any team violated any of Rules 1-3 during a tournament match, that team shall be immediately disqualified from the tournament, and all members prohibited from all future competitions.”  “Rule 11: If a referee appointed by the tournament organizers feels that he or she can reasonably conclude after a review of all available evidence that he or she feels would help them make their determination that any member of any team violated any of Rules 7-10 during a tournament game, that team shall immediately be considered to have forfeited the game in which the violation occurred.”  My original suggestion was that if a team was found to have violated any of rules 1-3, any past wins that they accrued in the tournament should retroactively be given to the teams that had lost against them.  I failed to state earlier that part of my rationale for suggesting that penalty is that it could be considered unfair for teams that had lost matches due to the other team cheating to still be out of the tournament because the cheating was not discovered until the team they lost to played in a later tournament game. If any player were to be found to have broken any of Rules 1-3, that would essentially show that they had committed an unambiguous act of intentional cheating, and it would be a strong indicator that they or others on their team had also broken one or more of those rules in any past matches they had competed. If you were to implement a retroactive reassignment of wins in the case of a team being discovered to have cheated, you’d have to create a procedure for giving some chance for the teams that had lost matches against teams that were found to be cheating to reenter the tournament, possibly including the replaying of matches, or playing of additional matches. You may decide that the additional work required in such an eventuality would be overly prohibitive. It might make sense in this situation to sacrifice some degree of fairness for the sake of expediency, and have the rules state that any team found to be have violated any of Rules 1-3 would forfeit the last match they played only, however I did want to make sure I clearly articulated my rationale for my original suggestion for you to make that call.  If you don’t wish to implement a system for retroactively reassigning earlier match wins in the case of a team being found to have cheated, I would suggest combining Rules 4 and 11 into a single rule.  As they are currently written, the only difference between them is that there is the additional penalty in Rule 4 of banning all members of a team in which one member was found to be cheating from participating in any future tournaments. Personally, I feel that this additional penalty is overly inflexible and unable to account for all eventualities, and should be removed.  For example, it’s not unimaginable that there could be a conflict between members of a team, resulting in one member of that team purposefully get caught cheating in order to ban the other members of her or his team from ever participating in any future tournament. I think that very few people would consider the banning of all team members in in such a situation to be a just outcome.  Also, I just noticed that I included a typo in Rule 4 that needs to be fixed. The word “they” should be deleted from the first line.  “Rule 5:  Bows, TNT Cannons, and detonating redstone traps are all allowed.”  “Rule 6:  To win a match, a team must complete its victory monument. The Victory Monument must have all three (3) wool blocks in the correct locations to be considered completed. If the Victory Monument is destroyed, all three wool blocks should be placed on dais for the Victory Monument to be considered completed.”  “Rule 12: Wool need not be placed in its exact location on the Victory Monument. If the Victory Monument is destroyed, all three wool blocks should be placed on the back row of the dais to be considered completed.”  Since these rules are all related to each other, and they all provide more of a general layout of the game than the other rules, I would suggest that they be placed next to each other at the beginning of the rule list. I believe that doing so would increase the ease of reading and referencing these rules.  ‘Rule 7: No player shall be permitted to break or destroy any of the three chests in their opponents' lane that begin the game containing colored wool, until and unless the chest in question has first been broken by some other means. These chests will be referred to as ""wool chests"".’  I don’t see any good reason for the inclusion of the definition of the term “wool chest” in this rule, and unless there’s some reason for it being here that I don’t see, I would suggest that it be removed. The term “wool chest” is not used at any other point in these rules, and I don’t see any need to define the term here if it is not used at any other point in these rules.  “Rule 8: No player shall be permitted to place or push blocks outside of his or her lane by any method, including manual placement or pistons.”  If you really want to include this rule, I would suggest that you remove the term “any method”, since that might seem to create some ambiguity around the legality of blasting TNT or other blocks out of your lane with TNT cannons.  ""Rule 9: No player shall be permitted to intentionally break any blocks on the starting platform. No player shall be permitted to take any supplies in the Practice Range from the starting platform.""  Nice addition. I hadn't considered that. ☺  “Rule 10: No player shall be permitted to cause the lava in Pain Water in his or her lane to turn into obsidian, either by placing/removing blocks in that area, or through any other means. It is intended for a player to peek into the center void lane for air in order to complete this obstacle.”   I feel that the map design and other rules make it fairly obvious that that’s how one progresses through Painwater, and I’m concerned that the inclusion of this piece of information might unnecessarily dilute the more important information in these rules, reducing its prominence.   If you feel that it’s important to let players know that they can partially exit their lane in order for their characters to breath while traversing Painwater within these rules, I would suggest that you convey that information by implying it in the context of an example you give in Rule 3 to clarify a broader principle, so that you’re essentially hitting two birds with one stone. It could be an additional line at the end of Rule 3 that reads as follows:  “It should be emphasized that this rule applies to any and all situations in which a competitor completely exits their lane for even a fraction of a second, including, but not limited to instances in which they move so far out of the water in Pain Water while refilling their air bar that they temporary enter a state of freefall.”",☺

t5_2qh1i,poteaser,1322843794,"How Could You? By Jim Willis, ©2001   When I was a puppy, I entertained you with my antics and made you laugh. You called me your child, and despite a number of chewed shoes and a couple of murdered throw pillows, I became your best friend.   Whenever I was ""bad,"" you'd shake your finger at me and ask ""How could you?"" -- but then you'd relent and roll me over for a belly rub. My housebreaking took a little longer than expected, because you were terribly busy, but we worked on that together. I remember those nights of nuzzling you in bed and listening to your confidences and secret dreams, and I believed that life could not be any more perfect.   We went for long walks and runs in the park, car rides, stops for ice cream (I only got the cone because ""ice cream is bad for dogs"" you said), and I took long naps in the sun waiting for you to come home at the end of the day.   Gradually, you began spending more time at work and on your career, and more time searching for a human mate. I waited for you patiently, comforted you through heartbreaks and disappointments, never chided you about bad decisions, and romped with glee at your homecomings, and when you fell in love.   She, now your wife, is not a ""dog person"" -- still I welcomed her into our home, tried to show her affection, and obeyed her. I was happy because you were happy.   Then the human babies came along and I shared your excitement. I was fascinated by their pinkness, how they smelled, and I wanted to mother them, too. Only she and you worried that I might hurt them, and I spent most of my time banished to another room, or to a dog crate. Oh, how I wanted to love them, but I became a ""prisoner of love.""   As they began to grow, I became their friend. They clung to my fur and pulled themselves up on wobbly legs, poked fingers in my eyes, investigated my ears, and gave me kisses on my nose. I loved everything about them and their touch -- because your touch was now so infrequent -- and I would've defended them with my life if need be. I would sneak into their beds and listen to their worries and secret dreams, and together we waited for the sound of your car in the driveway.   There had been a time, when others asked you if you had a dog, that you produced a photo of me from your wallet and told them stories about me. These past few years, you just answered ""yes"" and changed the subject. I had gone from being ""your dog"" to ""just a dog,"" and you resented every expenditure on my behalf.   Now, you have a new career opportunity in another city, and you and they will be moving to an apartment that does not allow pets. You've made the right decision for your ""family,"" but there was a time when I was your only family.   I was excited about the car ride until we arrived at the animal shelter. It smelled of dogs and cats, of fear, of hopelessness. You filled out the paperwork and said ""I know you will find a good home for her."" They shrugged and gave you a pained look. They understand the realities facing a middle-aged dog, even one with ""papers.""   You had to pry your son's fingers loose from my collar as he screamed, ""No, Daddy! Please don't let them take my dog!"" And I worried for him, and what lessons you had just taught him about friendship and loyalty, about love and responsibility, and about respect for all life.   You gave me a good-bye pat on the head, avoided my eyes, and politely refused to take my collar and leash with you. You had a deadline to meet and now I have one, too. After you left, the two nice ladies said you probably knew about your upcoming move months ago and made no attempt to find me another good home. They shook their heads and asked ""How could you?""   They are as attentive to us here in the shelter as their busy schedules allow. They feed us, of course, but I lost my appetite days ago. At first, whenever anyone passed my pen, I rushed to the front, hoping it was you that you had changed your mind -- that this was all a bad dream...or I hoped it would at least be someone who cared, anyone who might save me.   When I realized I could not compete with the frolicking for attention of happy puppies, oblivious to their own fate, I retreated to a far corner and waited. I heard her footsteps as she came for me at the end of the day, and I padded along the aisle after her to a separate room. A blissfully quiet room.   She placed me on the table and rubbed my ears, and told me not to worry. My heart pounded in anticipation of what was to come, but there was also a sense of relief. The prisoner of love had run out of days.   As is my nature, I was more concerned about her. The burden which she bears weighs heavily on her, and I know that, the same way I knew your every mood. She gently placed a tourniquet around my foreleg as a tear ran down her cheek. I licked her hand in the same way I used to comfort you so many years ago.   She expertly slid the hypodermic needle into my vein. As I felt the sting and the cool liquid coursing through my body, I lay down sleepily, looked into her kind eyes and murmured ""How could you?"" Perhaps because she understood my dogspeak, she said ""I'm so sorry."" She hugged me, and hurriedly explained it was her job to make sure I went to a better place, where I wouldn't be ignored or abused or abandoned, or have to fend for myself --a place of love and light so very different from this earthly place.   And with my last bit of energy, I tried to convey to her with a thump of my tail that my ""How could you?"" was not directed at her. It was directed at you, My Beloved Master, I was thinking of you. I will think of you and wait for you forever. May everyone in your life continue to show you so much loyalty.",©

Effects on Driving: The drug manufacturer suggests that patients receiving treatment with Marinol® should be specifically warned not to drive until it is established that they are able to tolerate the drug and perform such tasks safely. Epidemiology data from road traffic arrests and fatalities indicate that after alcohol, marijuana is the most frequently detected psychoactive substance among driving populations.   *Marijuana has been shown to impair performance on driving simulator tasks and on open and closed driving courses for up to approximately 3 hours*.   *Decreased car handling performance, increased reaction times, impaired time and distance estimation, inability to maintain headway, lateral travel, subjective sleepiness, motor incoordination, and impaired sustained vigilance have all been reported.*   *Some drivers may actually be able to improve performance for brief periods by overcompensating for self-perceived impairment.*   **The greater the demands placed on the driver, however, the more critical the likely impairment**.   Marijuana may particularly impair monotonous and prolonged driving.   *Decision times to evaluate situations and determine appropriate responses increase*. Mixing alcohol and marijuana may dramatically produce effects greater than either drug on its own.    edit: I really expect better of you guys, trees.

To remove carbon and varnish deposits more quickly, Sea Foam® can be induced directly into the combustion chamber via the following method.

Consequently, this process should only be attempted by technicians with a comprehensive understanding of the engine’s induction system or use Sea Foam® Spray through the throttle body (discribed in a different section of this web site).  Once the product has been applied, turn off the engine and allow the Sea Foam® to heat soak for a minimum of 10 minutes.

t5_2qlqh,RabidRaccoon,1322874684,"It seems like the LRA - linear response actuator was actually developed by Samsung  http://robot.kaist.ac.kr/paper/article.php?n=301  &gt; Since visual information is the most dominant sensory input for perceiving an object, the mechanical keypad has been replaced by a touch screen. In addition, vibration actuator has been incorporated into the mobile devices, because haptic information coupled with visual information can increase the sense of reality and excitation. Accordingly, many haptic researchers have focused on generating haptic sensation using a commercial eccentric vibration motor [1-4]. Immersion Corporation developed the VibTonz ® system to generate several vibrotactile sensations using an eccentric vibration motor [5]. However, there was a limitation to create various tactile sensations because of the slow response rate.  &gt; &gt; To overcome the limitation, various vibration actuators have been developed. Ivan Poupyrev et al. proposed TouchEngine actuator using PZT ceramic for a small hand-held computing device [6]. Although this actuator has fast response time and can generate various haptic patterns, it is too fragile to be embedded into the mobile devices and controller of the piezo actuator is quite heavy. Linear Resonance Actuator (LRA) was developed by Samsung Electro-Mechanics using a solenoid, a permanent magnet, and an elastic spring [7]. To improve the response rate of the vibration actuator, the LRA uses linear actuation. In addition, The LRA uses resonant frequency to amplify the vibration strength. The structure of the LRA is durable, and its size is small enough to be inserted into the mobile devices. Hence, the LRA has been widely commercialized in mobile devices. However, when the LRA generates vibration, the vibration contains unexpected aftershocks. This problem usually happens in open-loop system. A feed-back controller can solve this problem by reducing unexpected vibration. Therefore, this paper proposes the smart actuator with feedback function. The proposed smart actuator combines actuator and sensor in small size.  The one in the paper is clever - they use a solenoid to generate the vibration and a piezoelectric crystal as a sensor. So you have closed loop control. Mind you I can imagine this would be less ""throaty"" and more ""hollow"" than the old school technique.  I knew about the eccentric motor technique - that's been around for ages. But the LRA stuff is new to me.  I hate haptic feedback myself - I always turn it off - and just want something where I won't miss texts when it is set on vibrate. So probably I'd prefer the old technique.",®

From the moment Donna regains consciousness, the episode goes into a nose-dive that the series doesn't really recover from until *The Water's of Mars*.  I did recently re-watch *Smith and Jones* and *Gridlock*, and I found myself rather enjoying RTD's writing for the first time in a while. I guess it helps to try and watch only the episodes that you remember enjoying the first time, as the only episode I've re-evaluated for the better is *The Girl in the Fireplace*.  All post-revival finales are largely awful though. They all seem to follow the same tired, boring script that the writer churns out as a mindless crown-pleaser (how many times did Earth need to be invaded by classic enemies while people run around screaming and pointing at the sky?). The only 'Episode 13' I can bear re-watching is *The Wedding of River Song*, as it's absolutely brimming with wonderful ideas, concepts and characters (even if it is a partial re-tread of *The Big Bang*) and helps close most of the series' questions in a satisfactory manner.  I think I may have been a bit harsh on RTD in recent years, as he did write some wonderful non-finale episodes. I think that *The End of Time* has consistently clouded my judgement on the issue, as I consider it the absolute worst RTD-penned script.

t5_2qh9z,1whhiteduck,1322960239,"I recently sent the following letter to my physician. Thought it might shed a little light on this badly neglected issue:  Dear Dr. Jones,     On December 1, 2011, my wife and I brought our 4 year old daughter Angela in for a checkup. Fortunately, she is in excellent health but she did need to update her immunizations. In the past, when we were residing overseas, Angie’s vaccinations were administered by Dr. Torres who managed to distract Angie and perform the vaccinations so quickly that there was only momentary trauma after the fact.       Her experience at your clinic was quite different. There was much more overt discussion about the upcoming injections, and the fact that another individual was being brought in to “do the hard stuff” as you put it, created more drama and ultimately trauma for Angie. When your assistant came in, I could see Angie’s anxiety accelerating and the fact that she was allowed to see the syringes, in my opinion greatly exacerbated her apprehension.      Fortunately, the flu vaccine was administered in the form of an inhalant but when it came time for the needles, Angie had a complete breakdown. The magnitude of her distress was alarmingly high and as one who has suffered from trypanophobia all my life, I understand the panic she was feeling at that moment.      The attendant attempted to cajole her in to submitting to the procedure(s) but she was completely overcome with fear and was screaming to go home. There was no way to defuse the situation through rational discussion.      In the end, my wife was instructed to physically restrain my daughter while the injections were administered. After we left it was clear that my daughter was still deeply traumatized and she continued to cry for an hour or more afterwards. Since then, she has approached me repeatedly voicing her dread of future vaccinations.     In looking back on the incident, I wonder whether you feel that it was handled in the best possible way. It is not my intent to criticize but I am curious about your philosophy and approach to matters like this. I cannot help but feel that restraining her was not the best choice and I am concerned about the potential psychological impact of such a personal violation. Moving forward, I am hoping that we can agree on an approach that better suit Angie’s needs.     As I’m sure you are aware, trypanophobia is one of the most common phobias and may result in serious physiological and physical responses. More often, it leads the sufferer to avoid all medical care, thus endangering the health of that individual. I am convinced that my daughter shares this affliction with me as approximately 80% of trypanophobes report that a relative within the first degree exhibits the same disorder.     There are products on the market that can help trypanophobic patients cope. One of the most effective steps in overcoming severe needle phobia is to anesthetize the site of the needle stick with the goal of temporarily blocking the needle puncture signals to the brain. A topical anesthesia can eliminate this sensation of being stuck by a needle.     The Synera® topical patch is approved in the United States to provide local dermal analgesia for superficial venous access and I would appreciate it if you would prescribe it for Angela’s next vaccination in hopes that we can diminish her fears and help her to overcome her trypanophobia. I’m sure that you will agree that this is a very worthwhile goal as it will help her to feel more confident as she addresses her healthcare needs in the future.  Thank you,   Hope this helps. ",®

Do not expose your nylon or polyester ropes to chemicals. That said, much recent data has been collected regarding how substances affect rope life. Data available from Honeywell Corporation (makers of nylon 6, polyester and Spectra®) shows that **nylon’s strength is not greatly affected by [lots of other stuff] or insect repellents containing DEET**. Chemicals that should be avoided at all costs are bleach and sulfuric acid.

t5_2qpzs,woebot,1323061003,"&gt;I know there are other ways, but I just feel so drained, I don't even want to try anymore. That's partly why suicide is so appealing to me. I don't want to fix things; I want to stop them, permanently.  It sounds like you need to give yourself a ""[time out](http://i.imgur.com/OkiP6.jpg)"". Even if all the time you can grab is an hour a day to just watch some mindless tv or take a graphic novel into the bath (without the playlist this time). As the saying goes (snopes may disagree) ""It takes 45 muscles to frown and 22 to smile but it doesn't take any at all to just [lay there with a dumb look on your face](http://i.imgur.com/1QVkJ.jpg)"". So just do that for a while. Don't fight it - just drop right down into it. I call it ""the dumb look on my face relaxation method""™. After a while, and it doesn't have to be today, your body and mind will tell you that it's ready to pick up again.  Change doesn't have to be painful at all. I sometimes think of it a bit like this, if you'll excuse the metaphor:  I was once doing some agency work and got a call to be a bin-man for a day (garbage man). ""What the hell"", I thought. I'll try anything once. Anyway, I turned up and was told it'd be hard work as it was after a bank holiday and the bins were all extra full.  Anyway, all the other guys were just getting on with it but I started really struggling. This was before bins had wheels so the job entailed carrying an empty industrial size bin up to the one to be emptied, tipping all the food, nappies (diapers), porn mags, maggots etc. out into the empty bin and then carrying that back to the lorry (truck).  I could hardly lift the full bins. I was struggling around, leaning back as far as I could and waddling slowly and precariously forward with my smelly burden as I felt the base of my spine threatening to pop out in a direction that most people would consider untidy. On top of this I was holding everyone up. The worse I felt, the more I struggled and I felt more and more inclined to throw in the towel and walk the however many miles it was back to my car in utter shame. I was ready to burst into tears.  I took a final look at the other guys to see exactly how they were accomplishing this superhuman task apparently without even breaking a sweat. They were lifting the bins up onto their shoulders in one clean jerk and then balancing them there, head to one side, arm held aloft to hold the handle.  I practised this method on a half-empty binload and to my surprise it went straight up to my shoulder and stayed there as I walked to the truck. I felt a million miles tall as I walked past my colleagues and saw the recognisable look of ""the idiot's finally got it"" in their faces.  I tried a full-to-the-brim bin on my next journey and, though much heavier, it stayed up on my shoulder too. ""This moron's unstoppable"" I thought to myself, and as the day wore on and I got smellier and smellier I realised that that change in the way I was carrying my crap around had made the difference between getting paid for a hard day's work and walking away in humiliation. At the end of the day we were told that our lorry and crew had broken the record for the most crap ever carried in one day. I was as proud as I was stinky and as I drove home I treated myself to the vow that never in my entire fucking life would I ever go near that job again. Then I had a bath.  &gt;How would my life be different if I were not anxious? Honestly, the thought terrifies me.  It seems like your anxiety is almost a comfort to you. Is that correct? Do you feel like you wouldn't get things done if you didn't worry about them first? Do you sometimes worry that you're not worried enough about what you need to do?  You mention that when you treat your anxiety that it feels:  &gt;empty, scary, like something's missing.  Are we talking about antidepressants or anxiolytics here? Because that's a common feeling, and a healthy one as far as I'm concerned. I'm not knocking these approaches at all but I sometimes think that this mis-match is just a signal from the body or the mind that you've missed something. Sometimes it's also just that you've developed a habit of feeling anxious, though, and it'll slowly feel more normal day by day to get on with your routine in a more calm manner.  Anxiety, after all, is simply a remnant of our more primitive selves' flight or fight response. Modern life has stresses that you can't just bite in the jugular or sprint to the nearest tree, scamper up it and then make rude gestures at the big furry thing that intended to make you its lunch. What we do have today, though is methods such as relaxation techniques to gain conscious control of our breathing, our heart-rates and the levels of adrenaline flowing throughout our bodies. So returning to my previous points, and hopefully making some sense out of this dreadful ramble, let me suggest this:  Make yourself a scale of 1-10, 1-100 or 1-37.349. Entirely arbitrary.  The first figure denotes something that you wouldn't worry about at all. Cleaning your teeth, for example. The higher figure is for something you'd worry about lots. I obviously don't know you so I'll chuck in a common example like an exam.  Now let's say that you need to do something like go to a friend's party. How much will you have to worry about that? Will 5 out of 10 be enough? 6 perhaps? I'd hate for you to have to use up some worry that you could be using for something more important, so would 4 do? That kind of thing.  Think of all the worry you could save. You could go out and blow it all on something that most people would positively shit themselves if they attempted it, like bungee jumping (you're going to tell me that that wouldn't phase you at all, now aren't you? Go ahead and make me look stupid. I don't mind. I'll just stand here with my dunce cap on.)  Oh yeah, relaxation techniques. Do you know any?",™

t5_2qhk3,Legolas-the-elf,1323061712,"&gt; Really it's like everything I try to contribute here is destroyed by people who want to harass me  On the off-chance you actually believe what you've just said:  Your traditionalist values and opinions are in opposition to the egalitarian values and opinions that lots of people here - what seems like the vast majority - hold.  Furthermore, you are pushing those values and opinions very aggressively and talking about them as if they are the Truth™.  Your values and opinions are just that - values and opinions.  Saying that women today shouldn't dress like whores is a value judgement, not objective fact.  Saying that men should put a stop to it by being the head of the household is an opinion, not objective fact.  The values that led you to these opinions are not shared by most of the people here.  People can disagree with you without being wrong.  You don't seem to understand that.  So yes, you're getting a lot of negative feedback.  And the *way* you're pushing this outlook on the subreddit, accusing others of ""harassing"" and being ""anti-male trolls"" looks very much like you aren't acting in good faith.  So the negative feedback escalates.  It's already escalated to the point when a moderator is asking you to stop and your submissions are getting buried quickly.  Your traditionalist values and opinions are incompatible with the egalitarian values and opinions of this subreddit.  Maybe you should stop trying to push this so hard, start [/r/TraditionalistMensRights](/r/TraditionalistMensRights) and let anybody who agrees with you follow you over there instead of forcing two incompatible value systems to mix together here.

While I accumulate the funds to buy a power cage, as an alternative I do front squats with dumbbells rested on my shoulders. How good / bad are these front squats compared to your regular barbell squats?  To me front squats always appear to be a more intense version of the barbell squat, they seem to recruit much the same muscles as a barbell squat. The biggest difference is that front squats are 'harder', and adding weight is much slower than on a program with barbell squats. I got this impression you don't particularly like front squats....why is that?  * That lower back soreness caused by heavy squatting and deadlifting. I've found that hanging from a pull-up bar after exercise helps in 'decompressing' the spine and reduces the soreness. What do you recommend for lower back soreness?   * People recommend program X or program Y after one is done with starting strength. In your considerable experience, have you come across people who intentionally decide to stall at certain weights, and keep following Starting Strength program forever? Is there anything wrong with this approach if one is only interested in maintaining strength and overall fitness, not bodybuilding? Do such individuals pay a heavy penalty on joint wear? I am mostly worried about my knees.  * Sex and masturbation. This might sound silly, but I ask in all seriousness. Many people on the net (including myself) are convinced ejaculating makes a man weaker. To the extent many forums and online communities have this online pledge system [No fap November, and so on (fap is euphemism for masturbation)]. In your opinion should one minimize -if not abstain- from sexual activity while seriously training? Does it have any benefits?  ",☺

When they become available again, you'll notice many exciting changes!  First of all, we'll have many new forums available where you can discuss all aspects of the game, from Crew Skills to PvP. The Guild Hall forums will be expanded significantly and will include new ""Looking for Guild"" forums, class forums will contain sub-forums for each Advanced Class, and we'll introduce a new Story and Lore forum for discussion of the game's setting and story. To encourage constructive community building, you'll also notice a ""New Player Help"" forum and a Community section that includes areas for regional check-ins and meetups, all kinds of fan creations and role-playing, and forums for server event organization. These are just some of the new forums we'll be introducing. We're looking forward to all the great discussion!  Another new feature we're implementing is our Community blog, which will appear at the top of www.SWTOR.com/community. We'll use this blog for important community announcements, updates, and to post articles of interest to our community members, so make sure to check it out frequently!  The launch Forums will be a fresh start: all threads, posts, and private messages will be removed and warnings and infractions on your account will be deleted. If you have any special posts or private messages that you would like to save, please do so now! When Early Game Access begins, only those who have redeemed their Pre-Order Code will be able to post on the forums, though everyone will be able to view them. Then, when the game officially launches, only those who have active game time will be permitted to post.  As we move forward, we will continue to improve our community forums. You can expect to see new features that make it easier to find developer posts and several updates to our skin to make everyday use of the forums easier for everyone.  We're very excited about the changes that are coming, and we can't wait to work with you to make the Star Wars™: The Old Republic™ community a great experience for everyone!",™

False.  I'm assuming that Chomsky hasn't *been* to Afghanistan. I have, multiple times. The peak of violence was in 2007. [And the Afghan people agree.](http://asiafoundation.org/resources/pdfs/TAF2011AGSurvey.pdf) (PDF link, page 24)  &gt;The people of Afghanistan, teetering on the edge of starvation in September 2001, were deprived of much of the food and medical assistance from international aid that was keeping them alive because Coalition airstrikes destroyed infrastructure and made travel unsafe for aid trucks.   False.  There are [fewer babies dying now](http://moph.gov.af/en/news/5104), more hospitals than since before the invasion, and the [average life expectancy has risen by almost 20 years](http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia-pacific/survey-finds-afghans-living-longer-fewer-infants-dying-as-health-care-improves/2011/11/30/gIQAHQglBO_story.html).  &gt;Chomsky laments that the US government largely dismissed these human-rights problems in its quest to ""secure our interests.""  False.  [Hundreds of billions of dollars](http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/mil_aid_to_afg_tot_dev_aid_est-aid-afghanistan-total-development-estimates) and tens of thousands of people have been sent to Afghanistan to rebuild the medical, telecommunications, energy, and civil infrastructures of Afghanistan. The US didn't destroy it, decades of war with the Soviet Union and its subsequent neglect by the Taliban did. The reason you didn't see ""Shock n'Awe 2001!™"" with the US invasion was because there was hardly any infrastructure left to destroy.  &gt;Chomsky was one of the few people in the United States at that time to publicly talk about how deeply the Central Intelligence Agency was involved in arming and training the mujahideen in Afghanistan during the 1980s.  False.   This is, and was, common knowledge. It was [widely reported in the press in the 80s.](http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=k3dkAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=CH8NAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2807,1481816&amp;dq=mujahideen&amp;hl=en)  And before anyone goes on about how the CIA created Bin Laden, let me just put out that both ""[The Black Book of Communism](http://www.amazon.com/Black-Book-Communism-Crimes-Repression/dp/0674076087/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1323215415&amp;sr=8-1)"" (Courtois, ed, 1997) and ""[The Sword and the Shield](http://www.amazon.com/Sword-Shield-Mitrokhin-Archive-History/dp/0465003125/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1323215458&amp;sr=1-1)"" (Mitrokhin, 1992) note that most of the ideological underpinnings of the modern-day jihad were put into place by the Soviet Union's attempts to eradicate Islam through violence, and that any US aid (none of which went to Bin Laden) was merely a confidence-boosting side show to the main conflict.   Not to mention the fact that in addition to the US, almost all of Europe, Saudi Arabia, and China, also gave aid to the Afghan Mujahideen.  &gt;For example, the United States recently risked a major international conflict with a nuclear-armed nation, Pakistan, by assassinating an influential figure in one of its major cities.  If you think we are not already engaged in an international conflict with parts of the Pakistan government, I have a bridge to sell you.  But I suppose I'm just pissing into the wind.

t5_2fwo,Rhomboid,1323267554,"I was a little surprised by the file hiding issue, so I had to do a little experimentation.  Apparently, if your locale is set to C aka POSIX, and python3 encounters a filename with unrepresentable bytes, and you've requested filenames as Unicode (i.e. you didn't pass a byte string to the function), then you get this weird thing where you get back a Unicode string with the unrepresentable bytes mapped into the Low Surrogates range (i.e. U+DC00 - U+DCFF).      $ touch ""$(PYTHONIOENCODING=utf8 python -c 'print u""snowman.\N{SNOWMAN}""')""          $ ls -l snowman*     -rw-rw-r-- 1 user user 0 2011-12-07 05:28 snowman.☃          $ python3 -c 'import os; print(os.listdir("".""))'     ['snowman.☃']          $ LC_ALL=C python3 -c 'import os; print(os.listdir("".""))'     ['snowman.\udce2\udc98\udc83']  I guess this was meant to make it possible to work with files with names of unknown/indeterminate encoding when the locale doesn't specify, since this mapping apparently works both ways -- you can pass this weird flavor of Unicode-but-not-really string as a filename and it will map it back to bytes if the locale is C/POSIX:      $ LC_ALL=C python3 -c 'import os; print(os.stat(""snowman.\udce2\udc98\udc83""))'     posix.stat_result(st_mode=33204, st_ino=1060099, st_dev=2049, st_nlink=1, st_uid=1000, st_gid=1000, st_size=0, st_atime=1323264513, st_mtime=1323264513, st_ctime=1323265055)  However, if you try to actually do anything with this string -- such as display it or write it over a network protocol -- you're pretty much fucked, because it's not a byte string so you can't decode it as utf-8, but it's not a real Unicode string either, so you can't print it:      $ python3 -c 'print(""snowman.\udce2\udc98\udc83"")'     Traceback (most recent call last):       File ""&lt;string&gt;"", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;     UnicodeEncodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't encode character '\udce2' in position 8: surrogates not allowed  It seems like the python people feel that you're meant to bite the bullet and use byte strings when working on \*nix systems, since that is not locale dependent:      $ LC_ALL=C python3 -c 'import os; print(os.listdir(b"".""))'     [b'snowman.\xe2\x98\x83']          $ python3 -c 'import os; print(os.listdir(b"".""))'     [b'snowman.\xe2\x98\x83']  But this of course then requires you to manually encode/decode filenames as UTF-8 for display or use in protocols.  So it would appear that when dealing with \*nix systems^[1] you have to choose the least-worst of:  1. Always check the locale setting at startup and complain/die if it's not set to UTF-8. 2. If you just want to read/write the contents of exiting files based entirely on tree traversal but never display filenames and never use user input to select files or otherwise filter the traversal, you can ignore the locale setting and just plow on ahead and let the surrogate-mapped strings do their thing.  (The number of real-world programs that can assume this is probably vanishingly close to nil.) 3. Always use the byte form of all file APIs and do manual conversion of filenames to and from UTF-8.  That's pretty sucky, python.  [1] This of course assumes that you expect/assume everything on your filesystem to be encoded with UTF-8, which hopefully is a sane assumption in this day and age.  Hopefully you're not going to try to support filenames in non-Unicode encodings like 8859 or whatnot.",☃

Much better to call update() every X miliseconds, and have the rendering interpolate between the two states (current state and previous state). That way the framerate can fluctuate, but the game will still run at full speed regardless. Also because you know update() is going to be called 20 times per second (for example), you can use a fixed timestep, which results in a much more numerically stable simulation.  It may sound like a lot of extra work, but it's much simpler than it sounds. There are more reasons to do it this way than I have time to list them all, but probably the biggest one for me is that it means you can record demo's by just saving the input state every update(), and when you play it back it will play back perfectly every time, on any computer. Also if you have timed competitive play (a racing game for example) it means that people can compare their lap times meaningfully.  tl;dr - different frame rates mean different physics.

t5_2ssmu,thetensor,1323370027,"&gt;I am quite familiar with the article you quoted and the ""hopper"" model of fitness. I strongly disagree with it for the reasons I have already stated above.  What reasons?  I see is assertions that you don't believe in general fitness: ""I will not acquiesce to having CrossFit, Inc. define [genera fitness and some other things] without an argument"", ""I think ""fitness"" is specific"", ""I'm certainly not going to try to figure out a way for them all to earn points toward 'general fitness'"".  &gt;Also, CrossFit in no way actually does this  It's a mixed bag.  Take the Games for example.  On the one hand, a lot of the movements are familiar CF movements that the athletes will have trained.  However, there's an ongoing effort to surprise the athletes with things that aren't CrossFit standards but are still reasonable ""fitness"" challenges.  At the 2011 Games, that included things like the swim and beach run, the softball throw, the handstand walk, the exercise bike, the sled pulls, and the ~~monkey bars~~ Killer Kage™.  At CrossFit gyms, you see less ""out of left field"" movements than at the Games because of equipment, space, and time limitations, but there's still a lot of variety.  &gt;nor is this in any way a ""statistical"" way of looking at fitness.  Is it the word ""statistical"" you don't like?  How about ""stochastic""?  It treats workout selection as a random process and defines ""fitness"" based on performance across a number of those workouts.  &gt;To get the best results, one must program for one's goals.  I agree -- you'll make the best progress toward some goal if you program for that goal.  That's not general fitness, though, it's specific.  &gt;And one must realize that there is no general fitness, only fitness for a task, though that task may be ill-defined and broad....  &gt;...general fitness is not something that can be measured. We can have a loose conception of it, but we're fooling ourselves if we pretend that we can somehow make a metric that compares disparate physical quantities such as stamina, strength, endurance, speed, power, etc objectively.  I think you're staking out a sort of ""single-sport fundamentalist"" position here that flies in the face of what most people call ""fitness"".  What about events like the various ""-athlons""?  Would you maintain that a person who swims *and* bikes *and* runs well is no more fit that a person who only runs?  Is a decathlon's combination of different track-and-field skills somehow illegitimate, and a decathlete ""unfit"" because he or she isn't the best in any single event?  (I'd **love** to see a decathlete competing in the CrossFit Games, BTW.)  The problem with your ""only specific fitness"" position is that even specific fitness isn't atomic -- it's composed of sub-skills like (CrossFit marketing alert!) endurance, stamina, strength, flexibility, etc.  If you get good at, say, powerlifting, you've probably improved all of those sub-skills to some extent, and there's carryover to other tasks.  This isn't new or controversial -- it's the whole idea of cross-training.  For many people (like me) who don't have a sport-specific goal, that ""carryover fitness"" is what we're interested in -- to prepare for life by filling in the gaps in our physical capabilities.

t5_2r3gv,Tarkaan,1323428057,"  “There was one subroutine called Psychologist and one subroutine called Loop Expert and one subroutine called Domain Expert, and so forth,” Lenat said. “There were maybe a hundred of these little beings altogether. You’d post a problem and one of them would recognize it and broadcast to the whole community a set of requests for what needed to get done in order to solve it. And anyone who—any being who could recognize any of those requests would respond to it, process it, and broadcast requests of what it needed to have done…That succeeded pretty well…One of the tasks we applied the program to was synthesizing Patrick Winston’s thesis.”  For his doctoral dissertation, Winston, who now heads the artificial intelligence laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, wrote a program—one of the classics in the field—that could learn to recognize simple block configurations, like arches. After being presented with samples of what is and is not an arch, the program would construct an internal model of the concept and use it to judge future examples.  First, Lenat wrote the dialogue his beings would engage in if they were writing Winston’s program. (The beings included one called User, the human running the program, who could be called on occasionally to supply information or resolve disputes.)  “For each Being we had a list of the very specific facts that it needed to know. And I coded them up and now we had this system that carried out the original dialogue perfectly. Each expert that was just the right expert came in at just the right time—it was spectacular, and, sure enough, Winston’s thesis program came out as the end product. And it was great—except it couldn’t do anything else.”  The program’s knowledge was too specific to apply to other tasks.  “Of all the 500,000 things that a psychologist might know we only put down that it had to know the ten things that it had to know in order to do Winston’s thesis program. And so if you asked anything else, and a psychologist should have responded, this one wouldn’t, because it didn’t know that. And so I was very depressed because on the one hand I’d succeeded with this massive goal, but on the other hand I hadn’t really learned anything. And the reason was that having a very specific target, knowing where you want to go, makes it too easy to get there…So I said, Okay, let’s try and design a program that doesn’t know where it’s going…And the idea of mathematics research came to me as the archetypal case where you’re playing around with concepts and you don’t really have any particular goal in mind…And so I said, Okay, fine, we’ll write down ahead of time all the knowledge that’s reasonable to know to guide a researcher in elementary mathematics. And then we’ll set the program loose and we won’t add to it or do anything to it and just see where it goes, and that will be the experiment.”  Johnson02.jpg A simplified version of Eurisko’s concept of Energy Gun.  (Adapted from Douglas B. Lenat, “EURISKO: A Program That Learns New Heuristics and Domain Concepts,” published in volume 21 of Artificial Intelligence journal, 1883.)  * * *  Lenat called his new program AM, for Automated Mathematician. For the next several months he coded into it knowledge about set theory, a very abstract and basic discipline that forms the infrastructure of mathematics. A set is simply a collection of objects(A,B,C,D), for example. It doesn’t matter what the letters represent: rocks, cars, people, galaxies. A set is an abstraction, and set theory is the science describing the behavior of this pure mindstuff.  For AM to understand set theory it had to know about such fundamental notions as equality (when two sets are identical), union (when two sets are combined to form a third set) and intersection (when the members that two sets have in common are used to form a third set). Lenat included 115 such concepts in AM, along with several hundred heuristics that captured some of the rudiments of mathematical discovery and aesthetics. One heuristic, for example, said that a good way to start exploring a concept is to find examples of it. Another said that if a concept has few examples, try creating a new, more general version of it.  Guided by such rules, AM conducted hundreds of experiments in set theory, modifying and combining ideas until new ones evolved like crystals growing in a supersaturated solution. In this way, the program chanced upon the concept of natural numbers, which enabled it to discover arithmetic. The concept of union led to that of addition; addition led to multiplication, which led to exponentiation.  One heuristic advised AM to study the inverse of interesting functions. Thus, AM turned multiplication into the concept of divisors. By applying a heuristic that suggested looking for extreme examples, it found numbers that have only two divisors: the primes. Once AM knew about primes it was only a matter of time before it created versions of such famous mathematical ideas as Goldbach’s conjecture (every even number greater than two is the sum of two primes) and the fundamental theorem of arithmetic: any number can be factored into a unique set of primes.  “AM went off and discovered hundreds of things,” Lenat said, “about half of which were useful and half of which were sort of weird and probably losers.” But, after its first 200 discoveries, AM began to run dry.  “It started doing silly things, one after another, like defining numbers that were both odd and even…or other just awful stuff that doesn’t exist, or of which there is only one.” The percentage of good concepts—the “hit rate,” as Lenat called it—dropped from 62.5% to less than 10%.  As the conceptual world AM was building grew increasingly complex, Lenat realized, the heuristics he had provided it were becoming inadequate. They had been written to deal with sets, not arithmetic and number theory. To test his hypothesis, Lenat added some new heuristics, raising the hit rate slightly.  Johnson03.jpg How the concept of prime numbers looks to Lenat’s Automated Mathematician.  (Adapted from Douglas B. Lenat, “The Nature of Heuristics,” published in volume 19 of Artificial Intelligence journal, 1982.)  * * *  Then he had an insight that led to the invention of Eurisko: Heuristics, like any other concept, could be coded in the system as boxes with slots. By giving the program access to its own heuristics, it could experiment with them, gathering data, analyzing pattems-helping them evolve to keep pace with the expanding conceptual realm. Heuristics could be applied to heuristics. The rules about when to specialize or generalize mathematical concets, or when to raise or lower their worth, or combine them to form new ideas-all could be applied to this new domain of learning how to make better discoveries.  When AM was accepted as Lenat’s doctoral dissertation in 1976, he was already at work on Eurisko.  So far, the program’s most profitable success has been in Traveller, but Lenat has found his system to be general enough to make discoveries-and discoveries about discoveries-in many domains. When loosed upon the field of microscopic circuitry design, Eurisko discovered a new configuration for a memory cell, which might, however be of limited use since, Lenat wrote, “the cell can be realized most efficiently on the surface of a Mobius strip.” By giving Eurisko a set of concepts about LISPthe language in which it is written-it was able to modify parts of itself to make them more efficient.  But as with any program, there are always bugs to work out. Sometimes a “mutant” heuristic appears that does little more than continually cause itself to be triggered, creating within the program an infinite loop. During one run, Lenat noticed that the number in the Worth slot of one newly discovered heuristic kept rising, indicating that Eurisko had made a particularly valuable find. As it turned out the heuristic performed no useful function. It simply examined the pool of new concepts, located those with the highest Worth values, and inserted its name in their My Creator slots.  It was a heuristic that, in effect, had learned how to cheat.  ©1984 George Johnson  George Johnson, a freelance writer, is reporting on the quest to build computers smarter than humans.",©

More often than not people use hyperbole to transition to an argument that people are familiar with (like you did) and then abandon the original premises(which you didn't).   Identifying hyperbole is perfectly acceptable in a debate, because it signifies a departure from logic. Hyperbole has no place in logical arguments :      ( n ↔ h ) ⊃ (( n &amp; h ) || ( !n &amp; !h ))   So, yes hyperbole isn't a fallacy as it isn't an appeal to logic.

At the hospital, they quickly CT scanned him and made sure he was stable.  Now, CT scans are great, but they're not perfect.  In order to be sure nothing's broken in the patient's neck, the physician needs to perform a physical exam in addition to the scan.  Obviously, the patient needs to answer the physician's questions as part of a complete exam.  The hospital protocol states that the patient must be mentally competent to do this.  In this instance, ""mentally competent"" includes a blood alcohol level below .150.  This guy had approximately three times that amount of alcohol onboard.  It was going to take him about 7 hours to metabolize enough booze to render him capable of participating in the exam.

It's Everywhere You Want To Be® Because it's accepted at millions of places worldwide, you can use it for nearly anything, including:  Monthly bills Dining Fast food Retail merchandise Groceries Movie tickets Prescriptions Gas and automotive services Internet/online purchases Phone orders Improve your money management with an up-to-date balance and transaction history. Debit card transactions are automatically deducted from your checking account and typically posted within 24 hours of your purchase. So you can check your updated balance and transaction record on your card issuer's website or by phone.  In addition, every month you'll also receive a checking account statement that details your purchases, including merchant name, location, date and amount. So it's easy to see where your money goes.  Gain peace of mind with Visa's extra security protections. When you sign for your purchases, your money comes directly from your checking account, but you also get security protections that help prevent, detect and resolve fraud, including:  Visa's Zero Liability Policy*, which protects you from unauthorized charges. Any funds taken from your account due to fraudulent use will be returned to you. Continuous fraud monitoring to detect and prevent suspicious activity on your debit card Access to Identity Theft Assistance to help you recover your identity and prevent further problems A 3-digit security code to verify your identity for Internet and phone purchases. Enjoy 3 ways to pay with Visa® Debit ... 1. Sign for purchases To ensure your purchase is protected, tell the cashier you want to sign for your purchase. Or, if there’s a PIN pad, swipe your card, press “credit” and sign. There’s no need to enter your PIN. You’ll be protected by Visa’s Zero Liability policy* and earn rewards if your card offers them. 2. PIN for cash back If you want cash back (at certain merchants), simply tell the cashier how much or, if there’s a PIN pad, swipe your card, press “debit” and enter your PIN.  3. Purchases without a signature or PIN For many purchases of $25 or less you may not be asked to sign the receipt or enter your PIN. In these environments, your purchase — even if it’s a $2 cup of coffee — is still protected from fraudulent activity and you’ll earn rewards if your card offers them.  You'll receive these same security protections when you use your Visa Debit card for online, phone and mail orders or for purchases at merchants that do not require a signature.  Earn rewards just by using your card. All Visa Debit cardholders can reward themselves by shopping and saving with merchant discounts just for Visa cardholders.  Some Visa Debit cards also offer rewards, like Visa Extras. With these cards, you get rewarded for all of your purchases — like paying bills, buying groceries and picking up your morning coffee. Contact your Visa Debit card issuer for rewards program details.",®

Gaining experience, or any kind of points for that matter, from killing is the single biggest incentive to attack everything you come across in a game. S.T.A.L.K.E.R. flies in the face of this by giving you nothing for killing beyond whatever you find on the body, which isn't very much. This actually makes you weigh the costs and benefits of engaging in combat. Whereas, if you earned exp or murder points™, there's no dilemma as the scale always tips in favour of killing.

t5_2qh2p,efrique,1323657382,"The common ancestor of humans, bonobos and chimps had 24 pairs of chromosomes.   Normally chromosomes have a particular region in the middle called a centromere, and special bits at each end called telomeres, which are a bit like the ends on shoelaces, and for a similar purpose.  We lost one pair when two ancestor chromosomes fused; [human Chromosome 2 has *two* separate centromeres and has *telomeres in between*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome_2_%28human%29). We can see that there were two chromosomes that at some point became joined together.  [wikipedia: The genetic structure of all the great apes is similar. Chromosomes 6, 13, 19, 21, 22, and X are structurally the same in all great apes. 3, 11, 14, 15, 18, and 20 match between gorillas, chimpanzees, and humans. Chimps and humans match on 1, 2p, 2q, 5, 7–10, 12, 16, and Y as well. Some older references will include Y as a match between gorillas, chimps, and humans, but chimpanzees (including bonobos) and humans have recently been found to share a large transposition from chromosome 1 to Y that is not found in other apes.^[4] ]  We can match up our chromosomes one-for-one with chimp chromosomes; they're very similar. Except, for our chromosome 2, two of their chromosomes match up, one with one part, another with the other part.  **Major edit** (I started out making a little addition, and got caught up):  As far as the various skulls go, take a look the image here (one I generated myself, but you can find the same information in published scientific papers - the source of the data is given on the linked page):  http://ecstathy.blogspot.com/2010/04/human-brain-evolution-clear-kink.html  Each little circle there represents a fossil, going back not quite 2 million years. On the x-axis ""&lt;--&gt;"" is time, with today (0 years ago) at the right end and about 1.8 million years ago at the left end. On the y-axis (↕) is brain volume (measured by the available volume for brain inside the skull).  You can clearly see the changing brain size over time. This involves a fairly dramatic change.  We diverged from the last human-chimp-bonobo common ancestor somewhere roughly around 5-7 million years ago -- that graph only shows skulls from genus *Homo*, which is only from the most recent third of that. If we track back further - including the Australopithecines, we see this:  http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2006/09/fun-with-homini-1.html  (the orange green and blue are nearly all the same points as in my data, the additional red points are Australopithecines.)  Chimpanzee skulls are 300-500 cc's, almost coincident with the early Australopithecines. Bonobos are 300-400ccs.  Early hominins from around the time of Pan-Homo divergence also have brain sizes not far from that. E.g. *Ardipithecus ramidus* has a brain size around 300-350 cm^3  (though *ramidus* is on the scene nearly a million years too late to be a direct ancestor of humans).   So from the early Australopithecines 3.25 million years ago human ancestors (or their near relatives) start out with a brain size about the same size as we find for hominins near the divergence time, and about the same size as modern chimps and bonobos. By 2 million years ago, Australopithecines have a brain size that is substantially bigger - quite similar to Homo habilis around 1.8 mya. Then we get to the rapid growth in brain size through various Homo species until we get to modern humans - who actually have slightly *smaller* brains than humans 50 thousand years ago. (Evolution goes both ways! sometimes things get bigger, sometimes they get smaller) ",↕

Adhesive overspray is always better prevented than removed. But several common solvents can help clean it off, including mineral spirits, turpentine, citrus-based cleaners or 3M™ Adhesive Remover. Be sure to follow proper precautionary measures when using solvents!      On hands, apply baby oil, cooking or vegetable oil, followed by soap and water.     On furniture, use a furniture polish.     On fabrics and carpet, first remove as much glue as possible with masking tape. Then dab the surface with a cloth dampened with one of the solvents listed above.      Or spraythe surface directly with 3M™ Adhesive Remover or a citrus-based cleaner.  Always test solvents and cleaners on inconspicuous areas of fabric or carpet first.  When using solvents, extinguish all ignition sources, including pilot lights, and follow the manufacturer's precautions and directions for use.  http://www.perfectfit.com/24783/155885/Upholstery-Adhesives/3M-Super-77-Super-Spray-Adhesive.html",™

So if you focus with him on really really careful alignment it should be just fine to do those poses with him. I wouldn't suggest all out avoidance of the poses (yet), but on modifying/adjusting to make the poses accessible to him with things that make the pose more stable like a block, the wall, or partners.  If it IS a cramp situation - since it's from the same poses all the time where the hip is in flexion I'd bet he's letting his hip flexors do all the work in those poses and it's just getting overworked. So then you could just work more on what pieces to soften and what pieces to let do the work 'cause the hip flexors do tend to try and steal the show, but in the long run it'll just make them tighter and lead to more hip/low back pain. Oh yeah and strengthening the legs/feet/core bc a lack of ease there would likely be why he'd be compensating with his hips.

Not necessarily exclusively that brand just the type of flexible substrate that they use.  The real problem with the elements that I am using is that it does not supply heat where it is needed per say.   My issue is with my fingers and toes, while my body extremitys and even palms maintain correct temperature, my fingers go painfuly numb from the cold!  So what I do is have this element inside a little material sack inside my glove, and when able I pull my fingers out of the fingerlets of the glove and wrap them around the element inside the glove.  Suprisingly this does not actualy make them comfortably warm, but usualy does take the chill off to the point of no pain.  So ya this is a very interesting subject for me personaly.  I really wanted to stay away from the nichrome or heating wire solutions but would definitely consider them if I could find a acceptable solution and example to my issue.   I assume you have seen the columbia bugaboo heated clothing line?  They are using what I am assuming is the flexible plastic substrate elements.

We are a 3 year old Seattle startup company focused on the managed services/servers industry and are seeking an experienced senior systems administrator with significant background in managing small technical teams.   At present, the founder, with nearly two decades of experience, has been managing the technical teams. We have reached a point in our growth that requires the founder to start focusing heavily on growth, strategic relationships, and the next phase of the company. . . taking us from startup to stable to expansion. We are about three months away from breakeven across the entire organization. As a capital intensive startup, our teams are currently underpaid and this position will certainly be no exception. You will need to truly understand what it takes to work for a startup, very low pay, more hours than usual, and working with limited resources -- it is indeed a challenge. That said, it is extremely rewarding and you would be entering the company at a point of significant growth.  Our technical team is made up of smart, dedicated, and capable young individuals that are ready to be mentored into professionals. We made an attempt to hire an operations manager earlier this year. . . in short order the technical team had him running in circles. My mistake hiring an operations person rather than a technically competent manager. The right candidate will need both technical skills (detailed below), patience, solid management skills, and consistency. Further development of processes, documentation, and the creation of reliable and consistent product deployments and customer experiences will be a primary goal.   We are about three months away from breakeven across the entire organization but that doesn't mean it's time for a dot-com era party! Profitability means applying more resources into our infrastructure, a slight pay bump for those who have dedicated themselves to the company for the past several years, and more money applied towards marketing and business development to continue our growth.   Do I still have your attention? We're offering all this excitement for a mere pittance of pay. . . literally! Starting pay of a flat $1600 per month. The odds of long hours is high. . . the odds of a few hair wrenching experiences is high. . . the odds of being frustrated now and then with a young team is definite. . . yet, being part of a company poised at the edge of explosive growth and being a key member of that success will be rewarding and mid/long term provide huge financial rewards. I have no doubt of our success, but it's time for some specific help to get us there.  You should be well skilled in systems administration. That means Linux, Windows, and networking. . . if I have to detail it out move on to the next job posting.

Date: 2011-12-10, 10:37AM PST Reply to: job-hvm5b-2746234255@craigslist.org[Errors when replying to ads?]  Job Title: Technical Team Manager &amp; Senior Systems Administrator Starting Date: Immediate  Job Description:   This is not the job for just anyone. . . read on at your own risk.   We are a 3 year old Seattle startup company focused on the managed services/servers industry and are seeking an experienced senior systems administrator with significant background in managing small technical teams.   At present, the founder, with nearly two decades of experience, has been managing the technical teams. We have reached a point in our growth that requires the founder to start focusing heavily on growth, strategic relationships, and the next phase of the company. . . taking us from startup to stable to expansion. We are about three months away from breakeven across the entire organization. As a capital intensive startup, our teams are currently underpaid and this position will certainly be no exception. You will need to truly understand what it takes to work for a startup, very low pay, more hours than usual, and working with limited resources -- it is indeed a challenge. That said, it is extremely rewarding and you would be entering the company at a point of significant growth.  Our technical team is made up of smart, dedicated, and capable young individuals that are ready to be mentored into professionals. We made an attempt to hire an operations manager earlier this year. . . in short order the technical team had him running in circles. My mistake hiring an operations person rather than a technically competent manager. The right candidate will need both technical skills (detailed below), patience, solid management skills, and consistency. Further development of processes, documentation, and the creation of reliable and consistent product deployments and customer experiences will be a primary goal.   We are about three months away from breakeven across the entire organization but that doesn't mean it's time for a dot-com era party! Profitability means applying more resources into our infrastructure, a slight pay bump for those who have dedicated themselves to the company for the past several years, and more money applied towards marketing and business development to continue our growth.   Do I still have your attention? We're offering all this excitement for a mere pittance of pay. . . literally! Starting pay of a flat $1600 per month. The odds of long hours is high. . . the odds of a few hair wrenching experiences is high. . . the odds of being frustrated now and then with a young team is definite. . . yet, being part of a company poised at the edge of explosive growth and being a key member of that success will be rewarding and mid/long term provide huge financial rewards. I have no doubt of our success, but it's time for some specific help to get us there.  You should be well skilled in systems administration. That means Linux, Windows, and networking. . . if I have to detail it out move on to the next job posting. You should have real experience managing a team, be organized, find and create efficiencies, have a great attitude, be able to motivate others, lead, guide, mentor, bolster, smile, roll up your sleeves, be stern when needed, and be a friend and a boss.   If you're wickedly technically smart masochist who loves startup companies. . . than send your resume and a well written cover letter explaining why this appeals to you.

t5_2t5x7,kduluth,1323756337,"Italian Buttercream Meringue Frosting Ingredients      4 sticks (1 pound) unsalted butter, slightly soft     1 cup Crisco® shortening     8 large egg whites ***     1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar     1/2 cup sugar     2 teaspoon clear, pure or powdered vanilla     1 cup sugar     1/4 cup water  Instructions      In a mixer, or by hand, beat butter and shortening together until smooth. Set aside in a cool area (68º F).      Combine egg whites and cream of tartar in large mixing bowl. Whip on a low medium until frothy. When white color is constant, slowly add 1/2 cup of sugar in a very fine stream. Continue to beat on medium.     While egg whites are beating, combine 1 cup of sugar and water in a small saucepan. Stir until dissolved, cook over medium heat until boiling. Cook to 250º F, as measured with a Candy Thermometer.     If egg whites haven’t yet reached a shiny, but softly stiff stage, turn them up onto high to finish beating. If whites reach shiny/soft/stiff stage before sugar syrup is ready, reduce speed to stir and keep mixing until syrup is ready. Increase speed of mixture. Pour a Tablespoon of syrup into whites (stay away from pouring them onto whip), beat for 10 seconds, continue until all of syrup is used. Beat meringue until bottom of bowl has cooled to about 98°. You want the meringue to return to a stiff/shiny peak before adding the butter mixture. This will make a more stable buttercream.     Using paddle, add butter, one heaping tablespoon at a time allowing mixture to mix for 10-15 seconds between additions. Continue until all butter is mixed in. If mixture breaks, continue beating at low-medium speed and mixture will come back together. Cool for about an hour in a cool area before using. Use immediately.     NOTE: For a sweeter tasting Italian Meringue Buttercream, beat in 1 cups of sifted powdered sugar in the end.      You can refrigerate it for a week, or freeze for several months. Be sure to allow the buttercream to come to room temperature, then whip it with an electric mixer on medium speed until it is once again thick, smooth, and shiny and returns to its original volume.      ***Because much of the syrup’s heat is lost to the bowl…the foam mass normally gets no hotter than 130 or 135 degrees F, which is insufficient to kill salmonella. You can use powdered pasteurized egg whites to make the Italian Meringue Buttercream if you are concerned.  ",®

My advice is to be open about how you feel and continue to talk with her. If it turns really irreparably bad at least you tried, and you now know.  The only problem, as I see it, is the question of children. My family is catholic and the question of why I won't baptize my two wonderful daughters is a constant (they know why, only they haven't really accepted it.

We’re going to not only respond to your feedback, but also hopefully exceed your expectations on how Star Wars: The Old Republic will evolve over time.  Many of you helped make the game what it is today by participating in our testing programs. You’ve watched the game grow over the past year and have been very vocal about things you’d like to see in the game in the future.  A team is never finished building a massively multiplayer game, so we’d like to take this opportunity to reveal a little information on what the team is working on for patches coming in the near future. Our priorities have been, and will continue to be, based off of the feedback we receive from our players.  • New Content – We will be adding new content to the galaxy on an ongoing basis. These worlds will include Operations, Flashpoints and solo content.   • Guild Functionality – Guilds are important to the long term health of any MMORPG. We have a huge list of guild centric features. This will be an ongoing effort that will probably never end.

In addition to that high level PVP content, expect new Warzones and new PvP features on a regular basis.  • Space Combat – We will continue to add missions to the space game. We also have a special project going on right now that will expand space gameplay in a significant way... for now the details will have to remain under wraps.   • Legacy System – The ability to select a surname for your character is just the start of something much bigger. Soon, the Legacy experience and levels you earn will grant your characters access to powers, objects and other cool benefits.   • And more – We have an entire team of developers working on future content. Right now we are focused on nothing else but Star Wars: The Old Republic, so expect new and cool things.  It is fair to say that we’re just as excited as you are about the launch of Star Wars: The Old Republic.

It's a proprietary blend of other hops, not a new species:  &gt;Following the success of the Falconer’s Flight™, we are very happy to introduce ZYTHOS™ ─ a proprietary hop blend created to embody the powerful tradition and aroma you expect for your finest ales and IPA brews. With targeted brewing values of 11.9% alpha and 5.0% beta, ZYTHOS is an IPA style blend created to optimize and exceed the aroma characteristics found in the finest American IPA's and Pale ales (and any other hoppy American style). ZYTHOS is not a replacement for proprietary varieties, but rather, a premium pellet blend that will compliment your current IPA and Pale Ale brews. This novel proprietary pellet blend is comprised of many of the Northwest’s most unique hop varieties and is perfect for any American-style IPA.

t5_2qh61,Ubermensch65532ONE,1323807399,"&gt;I suppose it also doesn't matter if study after study proves - empirically - that a complete absence of sex education and/or abstinence ""education"" actually increases teen pregnancy rates and the spread of stds amongst teens  Love a source.  Listen, in today's culture, we are forced to teach young kids sex education because of the cultural degeneracy.  A young girls sees sex in every tv show, every movie, every song and music video, she is inundated with sex.  There is a reason these problems didn't exist when we were stricter about cultural content in the 50s....  Maybe we have relegated ourselves to such a low point due to liberal progressives that we are forced to teach 11 year olds how to fuck, I dont know.  I think this proves my point though....    &gt;How dare anyone suggest that we should make contraceptives available to kids who - even though we don't like it - are going to have sex at a young age  With good parenting and a good upbringing in a wholesome community they won't....   You act as if everywhere throughout all time women were equally promiscuous.  Not all women are destined to be sluts.  Providing a kids with a condom, and saying ""but don't use it!"" is like giving a kid a gun in case hes kidnapped and saying ""but don't use it!""   &gt;we force them to have the child as a method of punishment  You think the rationale for the opposition to abortion is punishment?  You are clearly a woman.  &gt;So now not only has the girl wasted the next 18 years - at the least - of her life  Interesting take on the sacred role of mothering a child....  &gt;all this just so conservatives can avoid having a potentially awkward 10 minute conversation with their kids about sex.  What?  Parents don't want explicit sexual activity explained by strangers to their child in a compulsory educational facility...  They might want to create a school system where overtly sexual clothing is banned and decency standards are enforced.  But then the ACLU would come and ass fuck them with 50 Jew lawyers and 100 lawsuits.   &gt;With regard to dress codes, I suppose if you're going to make the kids ignorant by ""protecting"" them from reality, you may as well crush any fledgling notion of individuality they might have while you're at it...   Only a woman would think the ability to dress a certain way and cultivate a certain physical appearance is analogous to crushing all individuality.  The individuality of a person is determined by ideas and personality not appearance.   &gt;we shouldn't even refer to them as kids anymore at this point, how about ""Freedom Drones™"" ... it's got a nice ring to it, don't you think? We also can't leave out books.... I mean, all books  The group of people that want to indoctrinate children most robustly are the left.  The left wants to edit old books with he word nigger in them like Huck Finn.  The left almost as much as the right wants to neuter Darwin, teaching that evolution does not fully apply to humans for the goal of political correctness.  The left wants books written by women and blacks to be forced on students instead of Hemingway or Twain.  They teach Columbus as a bad man, and Andrew Jackson/Polk as murderers while ignoring the degenerate nature of Native Americans.  I am not Christian, I have much more respect for education then you do trust me.     &gt;They sure weren't! True Conservatives™ (like George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, Richard Perle, and Paul Wolfowitz) were off Bringing Democracy™ to Vietnam.  None of them were true conservatives, and none of them served in Vietnam.  They were neo-conservatives.  In other words they implemented liberal-progressive tendencies into conservatism and shored up the loss of libertarians isolationists and fiscal conservatives by co-opting the religious right.  That being said I fully support the Vietnam War and its end was a disgrace to anyone of that generation.  &gt;These people at Woodstock were truly deranged... I mean, two consenting adults having sex in the place of their choosing (in this case, the mud, as you put it) is not very conservative   Its not very dignified or civilized either, Americans don't act like rudding chimpanzees... There is a reason AIDs and STDs are such a problem today... The free love movement is a huge part of that.  You can't argue with facts.  &gt;conservatives like their sex to be non-consensual and predatory.\  Are you fucking insane?   &gt;War == Profit.  The last war the U.S. turned a profit from is probably the only war you support, World War II.  Funny, its the only war I am totally against.    &gt;Besides, war appeals to conservative notions masculinity -- the machismo so very prevalent within conservative ideology  The sentiments you are searching for that lead conservatives to love war are Honor and Patriotism.

From his latest book:  &gt;No one person has perfect knowledge as to man's emergence on this earth. Yet almost everyone has a strong religious, scientific, or emotional opinion he or she considers gospel. The creationists frown on the evolutionists, and the evolutionists dismiss the creationists as kooky and unscientific. Lost in this struggle are those who look objectively at the scientific evidence for evolution without feeling any need to reject the notion of an all-powerful, all-knowing Creator. My personal view is that recognizing the validity of the evolutionary process does not support atheism nor should it diminish one's view about God and the universe.  Make fun of him for being a creationist, but don't mindlessly repeat that he doesn't believe in the process of evolution. He tries to avoid alienating his fundamentalist supporters by not coming out and saying ""I ♥ evolution"", so instead he just says that you can be a creationist and still believe in evolution.",♥

Wario Land 4 was bitterly disappointing in comparison to its predecessors (WL2 and WL3 were phenomenal games that took a gamble with the open world ""you can't die"" puzzle platformer format and really paid off) and remains the second worst Wario game behind the turd that was Master in Disguise.  Also, Maximum Velocity had no real imagination or story behind it unlike other F-Zero games, contained AI that actually cheated on difficulty settings above Normal and only rewards you for your progression with another Cup of tracks and a few slightly improved vehicles.  I think Metroid: Zero Mission and Super Mario World would have been better. No offence but WL4 and FZMV were two of the several turds released on GBA.  Also, who at Nintendo do you have to blow for more Virtual Console releases anyway? The current rate at which they are releasing classic games via VC is horrifically slow, and the rate at which they are releasing **good** classic games via VC is around fifteen times slower.

If you check under My Account, you will see the following message:  &gt;If you are a pre-order customer, the following steps are NOT required for Early Game Access. However, in order to play Star Wars™: The Old Republic™ at the official launch of the game on December 20, 2011, 12:01AM EST (Pacific: December 19th, 9:01PM; European: December 20th, 05:01AM GMT, 06:01 CET), you must first answer a series of security questions and provide your contact information. Then you must redeem a Product Registration Code that came with the game, and either subscribe to the game or redeem a Game Time Code. Follow the steps outlined below!  &gt;Unless you are one of the Europeans that I mentioned earlier with an actual copy of the game (with dvds and everything), you should NOT have a product registration code registered yet.   &gt;If you pre-ordered a digital version of the Game on Origin...the official Game Product Registration Code of your digital edition will be emailed to the email address associated with your pre-order starting on December 16th at 8:00AM PST.  &gt;For physical versions of the game, your product registration code will be in the actual game box when you receive it.   &gt;**Please spread this information, as there seems to be a lot of confusion.** You can also check out our FAQ page here for more details.  &gt;Early Game Access is ongoing and we will continue inviting people throughout the rest of this week based on the order that people redeemed their pre-order code. Please see the pre-order FAQ.   &gt;This should have answered most concerns.  &gt;Now, the issue that we are currently trying to handle is the following: **if you have an actual Product Registration Code (as of this writing, it should only be those very few Europeans that got their game copies early by accident), and you are receiving an error after redeeming the code, please let us know in this thread.**",™

After all, everyone knows  the Marginalised™ have an obligation to conduct themselves with quiet dignity in the face of infuriating tribulation and if your quarry begins to get angry and “aggressive” then you have won! Why? Well, it’s very simple - just hold them as representative of their entire group! You could try saying something like “you realise you’re making all X look bad?”, or “well, congratulations for backing up the stereotype of X as being angry, irrational and oversensitive!” Maybe you can even say “well, I was about to say I was willing to listen to you, but then you got insulting so now I don’t have to!”  &gt;Don’t worry about silly things like their feelings - c’mon, they’re grownups, aren’t they! The only thing that matters is defending your discrimination as completely fair and to avoid examining your prejudiced arguments in ways that may challenge them. You could even drop this little bomb: ""You are damaging your cause by being angry, real understanding can only happen if all sides are respectful and patient"".  &gt;Not only do you come across as a smug, self-righteous asshat (though you may prefer the term “bigger person”) you can also manage to subtly make them feel guilty about their anger, as though it’s undeserved!

t5_2cneq,bdirnbac,1323956330,"http://robertreich.org/: November 18, 2011 Stop the Austerity Train Wreck! Robert Reich   The biggest question right now on Planet Washington is whether the congressional supercommittee will reach an agreement.  That’s the wrong question. Agreement or not, Washington is  on the road to making budget cuts that will slow the economy, increase unemployment, and impose additional hardship on millions of Americans.    The real question is how to stop this austerity train wreck, and substitute the following:   FIRST: no cuts before jobs are back – until unemployment is down to 5 percent. Until then, the economy needs a boost, not a cut. Consumers – whose spending is 70 percent of the economy – don’t have the money to boost the economy on their own. Their pay is dropping and they’re losing jobs.    SECOND: Make the boost big enough. 14 million Americans are out of work, and 10 million are working part time who need full-time jobs. The President’s proposed jobs program is a start but it’s tiny relative to what needs to be done. It would create fewer than 2 million jobs. We need a big jobs program – rebuilding America’s crumbling infrastructure, and including a WPA and Civilian Conservation Corps.  THIRD: To pay for this, raise taxes on the super-rich. It’s only fair. Never before has so much income and wealth been concentrated at the very top, and taxes on the top so low. Go back to the 70 percent marginal tax we had before 1980. And include more tax brackets at the top. It doesn’t make sense that any income over $375,000 is taxed at the same 35 percent, even if it’s a billion dollars. And tax all sources of income at the same rate, including capital gains.    FOURTH: Cut the budget where the real bloat is. Military spending and corporate welfare. End weapons systems that don’t work and stop wars we shouldn’t be fighting to begin with, and we save over $300 billion a year. Cut corporate welfare – subsidies and special tax breaks going to big agribusiness, big oil, big pharma, and big insurance – and we save another $100 billion.  Do you hear me, Washington? Do these four things and restore jobs and prosperity. Fail to do these, and you’ll make things much, much worse.  CHECK OUT: How to put America back to work By: Joseph E.

I found the malibal lotus and the sager np5165 to be the best options I could find, and they are around the same price.   for the sager np5165 i get the option of changing the wireless card from 802.11 Wireless B/G/N to a Intel® Advanced-N 6230 - 802.11A/B/G/N Wireless LAN Module.  Should I do this?  Does doing this create a noticeable difference in ping etc. while gaming?  In addition, on both of the models I have the option of upgrading to an i7 from an i5 CPU with lower GHz. I don't know much but I've read somewhere that the i5 might render things better, and faster than the i7. Should I stick with the stock i5 or upgrade to the i7?    Thank you for your time :)",®

t5_2qhnf,kain099,1324027141,"When Buddha uses the word suffering, it isn't translatable in English. The first noble truth is best described as dukkha. Dukkha is an Indian word which can loosely be translated as suffering but is actually a really complex word which means ""suffering at all levels"".   Dukkha is getting to work late. Dukkha is getting cancer. Dukkha is getting a D on a test you worked hard for. Dukkha is the death of a loved one.   It encompasses suffering at all levels and all stages, death, illness, pain, sadness, depression, numbness. But it encompasses all ranges of these feelings, whether it be vexation for someone showing up late to your party or complete mental breakdown because you have lost everyone in your family.   I found a website which explains Dukkha as follows:     The First Noble Truth The Noble Truth of dukkha dukkha ariya sacca © 2005–2011 The definition  ""Now this, monks, is the Noble Truth of dukkha: Birth is dukkha, aging is dukkha, death is dukkha; sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, &amp; despair are dukkha; association with the unbeloved is dukkha; separation from the loved is dukkha; not getting what is wanted is dukkha.

t5_2rfxx,caspman,1324047604,"&gt;Curious - how often do you play Leona?  Long story. I'll try to be brief...  Every time I played ranked games my team comp always had a lack of support champ OR someone was forced to play the support role and failed at it.  Then I decided to learn how to play support champs. I tried Taric, Soraka, Janna, Sona.... I failed hard on those. Then right after Leona's release I decided to test her as support. I was duolanning with a friend (normal game, not ranked), Leona/Ashe lane, and I was surprised to see how good Leona support was. Then I started to play her in rankeds. You have no idea how many times I was flamed in champ select for picking Leona until she became a ""popular"" support pick.  And nowadays 80% of the ranked games I play I rather play another role, but I have to play support every time because all other players can't.  I even try her in the jungle sometimes. She is slow but her ganks are DAMN worth.   ♥ Now I LOVE Leona, she is by far my most satisfying champ to play. ♥  (sorry for grammar mistakes, I'm a not native English speaker)",♥

t5_2qkaf,theycallmejerzee,1324075643,"Not CCENT, and I am not sure what ICND1 is. Here is my schools description of the course if it helps.  This course introduces students to fundamental networking  concepts and technologies. The material in this course  encompasses a broad range of technologies that facilitate  how people work, live, play, and learn by communicating  with voice, video, and other data. First, you will examine  human versus network communication and see the parallels  between them. Next, you will be introduced to the two  major models used to plan and implement networks: OSI  and TCP/IP. You will gain an understanding of the “layered”  approach to networks and examine the OSI and TCP/IP  layers in detail to understand their functions and services.  You will become familiar with the various network devices,  network addressing schemes and, finally, the types of  media used to carry data across the network. In this course,  you will gain experience using networking utilities and  tools, such as Packet Tracer and Wireshark®, to explore  networking protocols and concepts. These tools will help  you to develop an understanding of how data flows in a  network. A special “model Internet” is also used to provide a  test environment where a range of network services and data  can be observed and analyzed. ",®

I stood in front of the bathroom  mirror, psyched myself up, and crushed my own face in the pliers until  BOOM  Blood and pus splattered onto the mirror, the sink, and down my arm almost to my elbow.

When I straightened back up and took another look, I saw something black sticking out of the morass of my right cheek - it was a hair.    I gently tugged on it and unraveled a coiled hair about 16 inches long! I was relieved to understand the ""root"" of the problem, but it was pretty disturbing nonetheless.

t5_2qo3d,robomekk,1324103274,"Here goes:  If you have a master link in the chain, take it off and keep it in a picket safely. Then shorten the chain to the necessary length, making sure you end on an ""inside"" link to which you can attach the quick link later. You will need to test multiple ratios in order to get this to work, otherwise the chain tension (or lack thereof) will not allow you to pedal; the chain will just skip. So try out different ratios, ideally keeping the chain as straight as possible, in order to find one where the chain can be kept taught. You can now re-insert the quick-link and check that the chain is tight enough to pedal. It should look something like [this](http://goar.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/jury-rigged-ss.jpg). You may need to use the large or small cog up front in order to get decent tension, but be careful what ratio you choose. You need a gear that you can ride home in; too high-walking up any hill or obstacle, overly difficult, too low-spinning along at 5 km/h, arrive home 17 hours late. This process will inherently work better on some bikes than others, simply due to chainstay length and sprocket sizes. When you are done this, before you ride, make sure that nothing can get caught in the spokes. The derailleur should be removed, and it's shifter cable tucked, tied or removed to keep it out of the way. This may or may not work for you, but it usually works well enough to get you home if you ride carefully and walk steeper hills.  If your chain does not have a quicklink, simply do as above, except you need to break the chain more carefully and reassemble it with the chain tool. Start breaking the chain, but be sure not to let the pin be pushed all the way out.  Advance the breaker by one turn at a time or less once it gets close. Wiggle the chain side to side while pulling (deflect it) to try to pull it out of the link. It should look something like [this](http://www.atomiczombie.com/home/chains/figure-05.jpg). If you screw this part up, you can always start from the other end, as you are pulling links out anyway☺. Now, before you try to find a ratio, you have to realize that you need to reconnect the chain ""inside"" link to ""outside"" link (the one with the pin still in one of the plates). Now you can find a ratio that fits, put the chain on and push the pin back in. The pin should be sticking a little bit past the outside of the plate, so you will need to lever the inside link into the gap. Once it is in (it should snap into place if you left a bit of it sticking out) you simply flip the chain tool around the opposite way to how it was facing before. You carefully push the pin back into the chain, making sure that nothing comes out of alignment. If it gets hard to push in, back off, rotate the link a bit to make sure everything is in place, and resume pushing it in. Once it is in, the chain will be tighter here (will not want to flex). You will probably need to grab the chain and flex it (the other direction from the way it normally bends) a few times with your hands. This will loosen up the link and help keep the chain running as smooth as possible.  Once you make it home, make sure your derailleur hanger is perfectly straight. Some people would recommend buying a new chain too, but you can probably put the old one back together if you have all the pieces/don't feel like spending the money.  Broken chains are also done similarly, just pull out he broken link and reattach the shortened chain sans one link.   Hope that helps. Next time you or your friend breaks a derailleur or chain, you should know how to fix it temporarily at least.   If you don't quite understand, I would be happy to help you more.     TL;DR Keep the master link; it makes things easier.",☺

t5_2qh5b,Bugsysservant,1324172898,"I should preface this by saying that I am in no way a modal logician so if someone wants to correct this, please feel free.  That said, in the context of ""possible world semantics"" (which is what we're both using and is generally accepted for modal logic), you're close with you're definitions, but are implicitly mixing them up with some axioms.  ""▆ P"" is define roughly as: ""relative to a particular world X, in all worlds which X is connected to via its accessibility relations, P is true""  Likewise, ""♦ P"" is defined as: ""relative to a particular world X, in at least one world which X is connected to via its accessibility relations, P is true""  ""Accessibility relation"" is typically ill-defined, but usually can be intuitively understand as the connection between worlds such that a statement that is true in one might be/have been true in another.  So saying ""▆ P"" might mean, in all worlds which are/have been possible relative to our own, P is true. If you let P mean, say, Plato is a woman, it is true that ~ ▆ P, however, it is probably true that ♦ P. Or, it isn't true that Plato is necessarily a woman, but he might have been.  Then you have the axioms to consider. There are a bunch of axiomatic frameworks for modal logic, so I'll just focus on the standard ones.  The first, usually called ""T"", is ▆ P =&gt; P, or, reflexivity. So a world is connected to itself via its own accessibility relation. Otherwise, you could have statements like ""Plato is necessarily a woman"" which might be true, even though Plato was male in our own world.  The second, usually called ""K"", is ▆ (P =&gt; Q) =&gt; (▆ P =&gt; ▆ Q). I'm not even sure if this one can be false in the context of many worlds semantics. Essentially, if an if/then statement is true in every world, and the antecedent is true, then the consequent is true in every world. Regardless, it is worth noting if we're being formal about it since it is required for axiomatic modal logic.  The third (S5 can have the next two simplified to a single axiom, but I think it's simpler to break it up to two parts for the purpose of an explanation), usually called ""4"", is ▆ P=&gt; ▆ ▆ P, or transitivity. This lets you move along accessibility relations. So, if in our world it is possible that Plato was a woman, and in the world where Plato was a woman it is possible that Charlemagne was a crocodile, it is possible in our world that Charlemagne was a crocodile. This is the point where things start to get controversial since not everyone will agree with this axiom.  The fourth, usually called ""B"" after the Dutch mathematician Brouwer, is P =&gt; ▆ ♦ P, or symmetry. Basically, if it is possible in our world that Plato was a woman, then it is also possible in the world where Plato was a woman that Plato was a man. This is a bit harder to see from the axiom, but trust me on this (if you're curious, Saul Kripke was the one who first came up with the equivalence between these axioms and their mathematical relational counterparts, so look up Kripke semantics for a more detailed explanation). Again, this one is also controversial, and rarely taken without also taking axiom 4.  If you combine these four axioms, you get the system known as ""S5"". As all accessibility relations are transitive, reflexive and symmetric, every world is connected to every other world. So, to finally get around to answering your question, yes, in the context of S5 saying ♦ P is equivalent to saying ""P is possible in at least one world"", but that usually isn't the case. Nor is it always accepted that it should be. One could imagine that, while it is possible that Plato was a woman in our world, and in the world where Plato is a woman it is possible that the earth never existed, and in the world where the earth never existed it is possible that charge of electrons was very slightly different, that the world where electrons have a different charge is so different from our own that it was never possible from our perspective. In this case, S5 couldn't hold because the relationships between worlds wouldn't be transitive. If this were true, you could say that ""♦ ♦ ♦ E"", or, ""it is possibly possibly possibly the case that electrons have a different charge"".  For a different example: in book 1 of Spinoza's *Ethics*, he argues that substance is necessary. However, he uses an argument that is predicated upon the existence of substance. So, substance has to exist, and necessarily has to exist, but there is no purely logical reason that substance has to exist. In this case, it might be the case that (♦ ▆ S) ^ ~ ( ▆  ▆ S). In other words, It is possible that substance necessarily exists, but it isn't necessarily the case that substance necessarily exists.  Anyway, sorry for the long-winded reply, but I hope that clears up any questions.  *TLDR*: The box and diamond of modal logic don't refer to all worlds, but rather worlds in relation to other worlds. You're implicitly combining the definitions of these operators with the axioms of S5, which is the reason it seems weird that you can have complex modalities (since S5 collapses modalities down to the far-right-most).",♦

[http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/ms8sc/2_weeks_ago_i_gave_away_some_rocketfish_headsets/c33ft4o](Kung120): SRS® Wow enables the headset to provide even more amazing sound by enabling ""3d sound"", a feature that noticeably alters the sound output for games to add immersion quite unlike any headset I have experienced thus far.   [http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/ms8sc/2_weeks_ago_i_gave_away_some_rocketfish_headsets/c33fyqd](GnarShredd): Amazing sound quality that's crisp, clear, and covers a wide range. Extremely comfortable.  [http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/ms8sc/2_weeks_ago_i_gave_away_some_rocketfish_headsets/c33ibgz](Manacit): All in all, though, an extremely comfortable headset, I don't mind wearing it for five hours at a time when I switch from a BF3 binge to music and back again  [http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/ms8sc/2_weeks_ago_i_gave_away_some_rocketfish_headsets/c33iv9j](StarVixen): And the SRS 3D Sound made a huge difference that I never knew I was missing – wouldn’t want a headset without it from now on (and it’s nice that I can shut it off when necessary).  [http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/ms8sc/2_weeks_ago_i_gave_away_some_rocketfish_headsets/c33yn1z](kyren5058): There's a bass, volume and chat control as well as a mute-all mic that is definitely handy when playing a hectic match of BF3. The ability to switch mics from ear to ear is also something that I believed pushed this score from a fairly-good to great!  [http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/ms8sc/2_weeks_ago_i_gave_away_some_rocketfish_headsets/c347zfi](HaterTot): The modular design -- Flexibility is a wonderful thing. I will never expect less from any future gaming headset.  [http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/ms8sc/2_weeks_ago_i_gave_away_some_rocketfish_headsets/c35oeq4](Iamfivebears): The bass output is just the best of any pair of &lt; $100 headphones I've ever had. The in-line volume control is great, and the SRS ""3D Sound"" is incredibly interesting, though really only useful in certain situations (does almost nothing for Starcraft, but is very noticeable in Skyrim).

t5_2qh1i,guitars_cadilacs_etc,1324323066,"&gt;Why do employers put down entry-level positions and then require 2+ years of experience?!  Because a lot of college graduates have *highly* unrealistic evaluations of their skills.   Many college grads have never been tested in the unforgiving Real World®. Many college grads have been the beneficiary of 4 or more years of ass-kissing professors in classes that don't start till noon. Thus, many college grads are shocked by what the Real World® expects of them. **SHOCKED**. And they sometimes have *hilarious* little tantrums when they hear their work wasn't good enough and they need to do it again.   So companies have learned the hard way that hiring a fresh grad is often like inviting a spoiled cousin to stay at your house for the summer: they eat all the food, make a mess, and start screaming like a baby when you ask them to wash their own dishes.   Practically, you need to get *any* job that'll hire you. Don't expect to get hired in something that's *exactly* what you studied. Then, work hard, don't complain, make a good impression and ask lots of questions. Make long-term plans to shift towards something more to your liking. ",®

t5_2qh68,thedarkerside,1324330233,"  &gt; The Charter of Rights is part of our Constitution, as I'm sure you aware. &gt; I don't know how much you know about constitutional law in Canada, but somewhere along the way you clearly got mixed up. In Canada, the constitution is the supreme law of the land. Any law that is deemed by the courts to contradict the constitution is set aside.  You're completely missing my point. The law is written on paper, without the power of the state behind it to enforce it it is worth NOTHING. As long as those who hold the power (read: The Government) respects the law and upholds it we're all fine and dandy. The moment you have a Government in power that doesn't care the law is completely useless.  WHO is going to force the Harper Government™ to respect the court rulings?   &gt; Harper's government, or any government of Canada, does not have the option to ""ignore"" the Charter, or the courts. They are one of the most basic tenets of our parliamentary democracy, and an essential balance on the power of the executive and legislative branches.  Thank you. I am fully aware on how this is supposed to work. But I am also not naive enough to belief that a system created by man cannot be destroyed / ignored / undermined by men. There are ample examples out there of Charters and Constitutions being ignored and / or rewritten by those in power with little to no outcry from the citizenry.   &gt; I once asked a constitutional law professor from Osgoode Hall what would happen if the government stated that they would not ""adhere"" to the Supreme Court ruling on InSite. Her answer? ""Something bad."" &gt; Nobody knows what would happen. But a government attempting to ignore a SCC ruling would be completely unprecedented. Noone would know what to do because it has never happened before. If the government blatantly refused to abide by their constitutional duties, it is likely that they would be arrested. What would happen after, noone can say.  Who's going to do the arresting? The crown, I guess, could lay charges but that doesn't mean they would lead to an arrest.  Furthermore, they don't even need to ignore SCC rulings, they can just drag their feet for as long as possible or do it really really slow. The fact that the law professor states ""something bad"" is a pretty good indication that the courts would be very VERY hesitant in escalating the situation, they would try to poke / prod the Government into adhering to the ruling and who knows how long they'd get dragged along.  Yes, it would not be pretty but I am not talking about them outright telling the court to go and stuff it, merely delaying things and continuing on the path until they have broken what they want to break beyond repair.  &gt; But it is the understatement of the century to assume that the Charter is meaningless. It is the opposite, nothing means more than it in Canadian law.  I never said it's meaningless, I said it is meaningful only as long as those in power respect it. There IS a difference.",™

t5_2qh1i,Pizzaman99,1324332549,"The Karen Armstrong article is not relevant. There is nothing in the article mentioning Islamic Law; it’s about anti-semitism. Neither is the Andrew G. Bostom article.  The only relevant link you mentioned is the David Thompson article.  The part of the article that vaguely refers to Islamic Law:  &gt;In his Guardian columns, Faisal Bodi, a news editor of the Islam Channel TV station, has said many strange and wonderful things. In March, during the Abdul Rahman apostasy case, Bodi championed the orthodox punishment for those who leave the Religion of Peace™ – despite it being rather permanent and involving ritual murder: “It is an understandable response from people who cherish the religious basis of their societies to protect them… from the damage that an inferior worldview can wreak.” In a climate of cultural equivalence, it’s somewhat refreshing to hear a Guardiancolumnist openly refer to an “inferior worldview.” Though I suspect one might disagree with Bodi’s estimation of which worldview is less enlightened  I was unable to locate the article referenced by Mr. Thompson [Here](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2006/mar/27/faisalbodipost) is the March Guardian article; however that quote may have been removed, because it only appears in the comments.  However, the article seems to an argument *against* killing Adbul Rhaman.  I am unable to locate any biographic information about Mr. Bodi, other that “Faisal Bodi is a leading commentator on Muslim affairs. He started out as a journalist for Britain's first Muslim weekly before going freelance and writing for national broadsheet titles. In 2003 he joined al-Jazeera as a news editor and features regularly as a columnist for the Guardian.”  I don’t think Mr. Bodi qualifies as the voice of the left. ",™

Skyrim sounds like an overheating issue. If it gets too hot the laptop will just shut itself off to protect the CPU. If it feels like it's getting too hot then that's probably your issue.  As for BF3. There are all kinds of different things that could cause that issue. The basic issue is that BF3.exe just won't start for some reason. There are a pretty large number of reasons why it could crash so here's a few potential solutions. Otherwise you may want to try to sort through [this thread on Battlelog](http://battlelog.battlefield.com/bf3/forum/threadview/2832654624694860787/1/):  First thing you should do is try the server browser instead of quick match. I've never had much luck with it and using the server browser will let you drill down and find specific maps or map sizes.   If that doesn't work restart Origin.   If that doesn't work try right-clicking Battlefield 3 on the Origin games list and clicking repair to repair the install.   If that doesn't work uninstall and reinstall the browser plugin (can be uninstalled from the control panel).   If that doesn't work try a different browser (Chrome, Firefox, something you're not using). If that doesn't work try manually [updating PunkBuster](http://www.evenbalance.com/index.php?page=pbsetup.php).  If that doesn't work try this:  &gt; 1) Goto the folder where Origin installed BF3 (C:\Program Files (x86)\Battlefield 3\ Battlefield 3™) (thats where mine was installed)  &gt; 2) Rename the Battlefield 3™ folder to Battlefield 3 - (removing ™)  &gt; 3) Start regedit , browse to the following key :  &gt; HKEY LOCAL MACHINE\SOFTWARE\WoW6432Node\EA Games Change the GDFBinary &amp; InstallDir paths to C:\Program Files (x86)\Battlefield 3\ Battlefield 3 - again removing ™  Next try:  &gt; Go to Battlefield 3 folder and delete everything except the data folder and _installer.  &gt; In Origin right click on Battlefield 3 and choose repair install.

t5_2r2jt,sirfiddlestix,1324389681,"Can you not make your own connections? If I must be explicit then here: 1) Have you ever met this person IRL? Have you tested a sample of their genes? Didn't think so. Thus, even if they or their profile or whatever hints at them being male or female, you would never truly know unless they told you.  2) &gt; The key here is maintaining a careful blend of disdain and dismissal no matter what the Marginalised Person™ throws at you.  You've seemed to accomplish this.  &gt; Even though the conversation taking place is reflective...  I would quote the poster's entire post but it's a bit long (and with this being the last point I'm getting to this post needn't be much longer than I've already made it).  &gt; ...you must be careful to first insist on placing it within an academic framework  Example: from this ""You're also incorrect about what the term ""rape culture"" typically includes"" all the way to this: ""Again, you saying something does not make it true."" What it seems like you're implying is that you want everyone you argue with to write a paper worthy of being in a journal to prove their argument, while you only call people stupid in three different ways and present a series of relatively weak links to back yourself up (some of them do well enough however your ""Social Privilege"" link is by some random blogger who probably didn't list all the social privileges in the world. You would have been better off explaining social privilege yourself).   3)You said, ""if you're a man...and you're arguing against a woman in order to white-knight for some random dude, then perhaps you should take a step back and think about what exactly you're hoping to accomplish.""  What makes it so important that you are a woman? It's not like you're every woman or that all of the women that have ever existed share your opinion. So, the supposed fact that you are woman arguing in a rape thread is irrelevant.  Furthermore, your lack of insight into my opinion really leaves your claim of ""white-knighting"" unproven. Did you ever think that maybe I don't agree with either of you? Or perhaps I find your particular brand of arguing ineffective. 4)The fallacies you seem to be most in love with are the ""Strawman"" (a misrepresentation of your opponent's argument, usually a dilution of it) &gt; because it seemed like it would be an incoherent ramble in which you pull things out of your ass and then eventually come to some obvious point that no one really needed you to explain  and ""Ad Hominem"" (attacking the arguer instead of the argument), more specifically the ""Abusive Fallacy"" (i.e. name calling) &gt; That might amount to saying that I think you're pretty stupid, but that's not quite the same thing. I understand, though, that the distinction might easily be lost on a stupid person;  but you also seem to like the ""Argument from Silence"" (essentially you're wrong because you didn't give proof) &gt; You need to explain what part of someone's post you believe to be fallacious, rather than just say ""you shouldn't use fallacies."" Again, you saying something does not make it true  Sure, I may be guilty of ""Burden of Proof"", but I feel that if your curious about something I said that you can go look it up or use that grey matter just as easily as you could ask me.

t5_2qpp6,deblahCC,1324433697,"Really ? I mean it would only be on the minimap &amp; the outline would be quite thin. I doubt it would obstruct the minimap much.  Think of all the cool stuff it would bring. We could see how the player reacts to certain things.   * Where does he look when DTs come to his base ?   * Did he see those roaches/infestors burrow in his 3rd ?   * Did he see the drop as it passed in view of his pylon for just a second ? If he did, did he also spot the second drop coming in from the other side ?  * Was he looking at his army when the battle started or did he get suprised ? Is this why he lost the battle ?  * Did he see those cloaked ghosts ? Is he frantically looking all around the map for the nuke ? Did he catch it ?  These are just some ideas off the top of my head that I think would add another level of depth to the game. The casters try to explain &amp; determine if the player has seen ''such &amp; such'' action &amp; if that is the reason why he is building ''such &amp; such'' a unit. But they can't be certain you know ? Also, in a quick-paced game, the casters can't point out every small detail.  Let's say there is some harras going on at a zergs natural. The zerg is busy mircoing his queens (or whatever) etc &amp; terran is microing his hellions (or whatever). Meanwhile, the terran has taken a ninja expo &amp; the scv transfer moves just barely in sight of an overlord. Now the casters ( if they even see it ) can't look away from the action going on as it is much more important ( it can possibly end the game ), &amp; even if they could quickly pan over &amp; show this to the viewers, they would have no way of knowing if the zerg player caught this.   Now if this ''player camera'' thing was implemented, we the viewers, with a quick glance at the minimap would see the zerg players camera quickly pan over to his overlord &amp; then back to the battle at his natural. Bingo ! We now know that he is aware of the ninja expo &amp; his following actions will make more sense (as he is probably less afraid of a 1 base all in) as he mixes drones in with fighting units. I mean I would go all giddy if I would see this.   It's like we would be inside the players head &amp; we would better understand the **WHY** in pro games &amp; not just the how. We would be able to understand their builds better based on what they've seen, &amp; more importantly what they **didn't see**. Also, it would end all the speculation as to why a person lost a major engagement. Often in sc2 it's about positioning &amp; if a player is busy elsewhere when he gets attacked (even if pros take less than a second to get back to their army), he will have an ill-favored battle.  LOL I'm getting excited just thinking about this &amp; all the new experiences it would bring. We could see &amp; **FEEL** the tension &amp; excitement of 2 GSL pros manoeuvring their armies back and forth, left &amp; right, looking for the perfect moment to strike. The casters would benefit from this too. They would never get screwed again by watching some un-important action if they can see both players having their eye on their respective armies doing the **Dance of Death™** This is where they are within sight of each other but neither one attacks. This can go ( &amp; has gone ) on for long period of time, sometimes resulting in an epic, game ending battle, or both players retreat back to their base. Casters can easily miss the first few seconds of the battle as they have no way of knowing if both players are going to commit. After 20-30 seconds of them doing the DoD™, the casters will often move around &amp; show everything else that is going on, as they should do. They don't know if they are going to commit or even keep doing the DoD™ for another 2 minutes, but with the player cams it would be easy to see when both players are seriously considering fighting.   TL;DR :I don't think anything could go bad with these player cams &amp; I have nerd chills just thinking about it !  Sorry I got carried away.  Edited",™

Be extremely careful with this as it is the absolute strongest solution outside of industrial copper/brass tarnish remover. Once you're done you need to resurface/seal the cymbal. This will help keep if from tarnishing faster, and prolong the surface's life.  **Crazy John's Mean Clean® Formula Cymbal Cleaner**. It takes practice to use correctly, and if you're not careful will easily, easily strip any screen printing on the cymbal. It has (just like any tarnish remover) an abrasive chalky quality to it that polishes cymbals to a literal mirror finish. Its pretty easy to go overboard.  Once its polished seal it with something like **Paiste Cymbal Cleaner**. They may not make it the same way anymore, but if it has a viscus semi transparent milk like look to it, that what you're looking for. Go over it a second time, and go easy.  One of the best ways to keep they clean is to progressively clean them. That and using gloves (ugh). When you're done for the night, take a towel that has nothing on it. No oil, soap, polish, nothing, and wipe them down. I used to fold it over my middle finger and go over the whole cymbal. If you're worried about very tiny scratches (you will get scratches from a towel) either get a photographers microfiber lens cleaning cloth, or more practically an auto microfiber chamois.  I've experimented (see: done really stupid things) over the years, and using this technique with an electric buffer on a raw cymbal with no lathe marks, not only gave the cymbal perfect reflective surface, but brought out not normally seen hues in the surface. A platinum look.  Cymbals look gorgeous this way, but tragically sound awful. Good luck. ",®

Genetic approaches to complex traits such as personality have moved from single-gene models and methods to approaches that can identify genes of small effect size in multiple-gene systems called quantitative trait loci (QTLs). We review results for the association between dopamine D4 receptor (DRD4) and novelty seeking, which was the first QTL association reported for personality. The identification of QTLs will revolutionize genetic research on personality by providing measured genotypes for tracking the developmental course of genetic effects, for investigating genetic links between traits and between personality and biological mechanisms, and for identifying interactions and correlations between genes and environment. © 1998 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.

(they company claims they are more disease resistant, but this describes the farming technique not the fish.)  i've been reading the npr article, and it is agreeing with me on several points. so let me exaggerate.   the sterilization technique is not 100%. and even though there's always a chance some random chain of events caused a release (a tornado, an extreme rain event, a sinkhole into an underground river, aliens, barbarsol can egg safe) what will happen when these things are FDA approved is that there will eventually be large accidental releases of 99.99% sterile females. this fish is a product that will be licensed. the number of facilities will increase. people will desire the profits from this fish, that ""has the potential to grow to market size in half the time of conventional salmon""    people will not follow the rules, they will farm them on rivers in cages. their sterilization techniques will fail more often.  this is from the aquabounty website  Q. Can we be sure that AquAdvantage® Salmon will really be sterile?  A. Yes. There are specific tests to establish the effectiveness of our process to produce sterile fish. These tests will be performed on every commercial batch of fish to assure our product meets our specifications.  somehow i'm not convinced... i'm sure they are more worried about losing a fertile fish for financial/competitive/intellectual property reasons than they are about something being released into the wild to possibly affect nature.  this is also from their webpage http://www.aquabounty.com/images/Transgenic%20vs%20non-transgenic%20siblings%20CREDIT%20AquaBounty.jpg  their website sucks.  many of the answers they give to questions are lacking or arguable. they even take a bad tone in some.  they talk plenty about the chinook salmon gene, but not so much about the other modified gene (from a fish called an ocean pout).   i think aquaculture is good. i think a fish that grows huge really fast is exactly what you want.   but we have to make sure, no matter what, that it doesn't ever affect nature.     it would be the first transgenic animal with fda approval.  mad scientists all around the world will be working on products.

t5_2qqjc,bitparity,1324543558,"For any of you curious why any state/empire would entertain such a ridiculous system prone to disastrous inbreeds, its because the alternative leadership system was considered worse.  The alternative to ruling legitimacy via ""hereditary noble bloodline"" was ""military usurpation,"" where essentially he who can lead the strongest army takes the crown.    While military usurpation produces far superior rulers, it also keeps the country/empire in a constant state of civil war, which can wreak havoc on the economy, population, and survival of the state.  If anybody with an army can try to bid for supreme power, why shouldn't I?  Then it becomes a never ending whack-a-mole game of crush the latest pretender, leaving you weak and ripe for takeover by foreign powers who have their shit together.  See the ""Roman Crisis of the 3rd century"" if you're interested in a historical example of such hilariousness.  It was one of the reasons why Rome decided to switch from a (technically) non-hereditary first-among-equals system of emperors to a noble-blood hereditary I-am-your-god system of emperors.  50 years of civil war with a new emperor every 2 years will do that to an empire.  The inherited nobility system helped keep the pool of allowed candidates small, and allowed for intrigue to decide leadership over outright military conflict.  Those outside of the nobility system, were collaboratively crushed by all parties as a threat to the system.    This is why the French Revolution was such a BIG FUCKING DEAL™ to the European nobility, because it was the first time in a long time that a nation had decided to select its leaders by means other than noble birth.

No one has seen these purported videos, and you admit that not even you want to *research* your own claims. For now, it sounds like you are either making shit up or greatly exaggerating something that nobody else took note of.  For now, it looks to me like you're lying to justify TL's total ban on everything CombatEX (getting money involved in his list of ""crimes,"" rather than limiting it to just stream cheating and BM, which don't seem that serious to people outside of the StarCraft community), vilifying him to legitimize TL's ban to the community, while (if your accusations are false or exaggerated) further destroying his reputation beyond what he deserves.  &gt;Yeah i would edit the OP if i could.

These scumbags don't care one goddamn iota for their own countrymen, as evidenced yet again by their refusal to extend a hand and assist struggling families in their own constituency. Their actions, especially today, reflect greed and callous disregard for anything not involving continued and costly war which serves no purpose but to enrich their business buddies.

SSRIs should never be mixed with MAOIs, the combination may result in [serotonin syndrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) (which can lead to [faster-than-anticipated] death).

t5_2qh36,chrisdoner,1324562103,"&gt; Maybe you're halfway through an identifier name, so the current (partial) name isn't actually valid/bound.  That's not really a big deal. There should be a separation between typing something and validating it before putting it into the AST.  &gt; Or maybe you're still moving things around because you're deciding how to fit the pieces together in a way you like, so maybe it isn't even a well-formed AST.  I'd have to see some examples of that. You wouldn't move invalid things around so validity should be preserved for free.  &gt; because of infix operators and their differing user-defined associativities and precedences you can never be really sure what the partial AST should even be, since it can change as soon as the next token shows up (e.g., when moving from ""3 + 5"" to ""3 + 5 *"").  This can be sorted out with either (1) explicit parentheses, in which case there is no precedence nonsense (which I would prefer if it were just me using this editor, precedence frankly gets on my nerves), or, (2) inspecting the fixity declarations in scope.  Ideally, for me at least, it would be (1) for editing, but (2) for display.  Also, it depends on how entering code works. I've been thinking of typing arbitrary text in a box and then pressing RET to ""commit it to the AST"", if it's valid the text will become part of the AST, if it's wrong it just stays there in the box. Another, more interesting, way, would be for it to construct the AST as you go. Like this (where | is the caret):  * ⌨`3 +` → `(3 +[|])` * ⌨`3 + 2 * ` → `3 + (2 * [|]])` * ⌨`3 + 2 * 5 )` → `3 + (2 * 5) |` * ⌨`3 + 2 * 5 ) + ` → `3 + (2 * 5) + [|]` * ⌨`3 + 2 * 5 ) + BACKSPACE` → `3 + (2 * 5) |` * ⌨`3 + 2 * 5 ) + BACKSPACE UP LEFT -` → `3 |+ (2 * 5)` * ⌨`3 + 2 * 5 ) + BACKSPACE UP LEFT DEL -` → `3 -| (2 * 5)` * ⌨`3 + 2 * 5 ) + BACKSPACE UP LEFT LEFT 5 -` → `35| + (2 * 5)` * ⌨`"" hello "" ++` → `(""hello"" ++[|])` * ⌨`"" hello "" ++ y` → `(""hello"" ++ y|)` * ⌨`if` → `if|` *(at this point it's still a ""box"")* * ⌨`if SPC` → `if [|] then [] else []` * ⌨`if SPC BACKSPC` → `if|` * ⌨`if SPC x` → `if x| then [] else []` * ⌨`if SPC x TAB y` → `if x| then y| else []` * ⌨`if SPC x TAB y TAB z` → `if x| then y| else z|` * ⌨`case SPC` → `case [|] of [] -&gt; []` * ⌨`case SPC x TAB` → `case x of [|] -&gt; []` * ⌨`case SPC x TAB foo TAB` → `case x of foo -&gt; [|]` * ⌨`case SPC x TAB foo TAB bar` → `case x of foo -&gt; bar|` * ⌨`case SPC x TAB foo TAB bar TAB` → `case x of foo -&gt; bar; [|] -&gt; []`  You get the idea. Similar to paredit. But that's trickier.  &gt; The point is, there's always some stage in programming where everything's a mess.  Can you provide an example where the mess is syntactical mess?  &gt; Trying to impose well-formed structure on the messiness of development in every place and at every time is just doomed to failure,   I disagree, clearly. That's the whole point of a structured editor.  &gt; because development isn't universally pretty and well-structured. People are messy. Creativity is messy. But more importantly, we don't care about how people keep their houses just so long as they present themselves well in public.  You can be messy without being syntactically invalid.  &gt; The obvious solution is to consider an interface like Agda's sheds. In general, Agda will try to compile and typecheck everything for you, but sheds are a way of saying ""hey waitaminute! don't bother checking this part yet, because I know it's a mess"". You do all your mucking around and developing inside of sheds, and when you're ready to show it to the world (i.e., the compiler) then you remove the shed. This way, Agda can check everything that it knows is stable, but avoid things it knows are a mess, and so the checking isn't going to interfere with the messy process of figuring out what the heck you're trying to do.  I think you've misinterpreted my intentions. I don't care about type safety, I care about syntactical correctness. Not because being correct all the time would save me getting compile errors, but because it enables structured editing. Because structured editing, a la paredit, is fast and safe.  Sheds are a nice idea but they're a separate idea. I could also implement sheds separately, in a structured or non-structured editor.",⌨

In exchange, Colbert asked for the right to place his name on the primary as well as the inclusion of a non-binding referendum asking GOP voters to weigh in on whether corporations are people, as Mitt Romney suggested at an Iowa campaign stop earlier this year.  ""We hammered out a contract over barbecue. Colbert Super PAC would pay up to $400,000 directly to the state and counties to defray the cost of the election,"" Colbert writes. ""In return, the primary's official name would be 'The Colbert Super PAC South Carolina Republican Primary.' This name would appear on all press releases, official notices and signage, including the debates. We would finally raise democracy to the same level as the Tostitos™ Fiesta Bowl and Kardashian™ weddings."" -----  more:  While a state party official previously told Yahoo News the naming rights were never seriously considered, Colbert insists ""the GOP agreed to everything.""  The party did submit Colbert's proposed referendum to the state Election Commission, which polled voters on whether ""corporations are people"" or ""only people are people."" But the question was blocked, after a state Supreme Court decision last month removed all non-binding referendum from the primary ballot.  A court ruling also shifted the responsibility for funding the primary from the state GOP to counties around the state, but Colbert says party officials still offered to sell him naming rights—contrary to what they had told reporters, including Yahoo News.  ""The S.C. Republican Party no longer needed my $400,000, but being Southern gentlemen, they graciously offered to still want it. They would sell me the naming rights, if instead of giving my cash to the counties, I handed it directly to the party,"" Colbert writes. ""I asked in return that they petition the court to get the referendum back on the ballot. They said no. I offered less money, $200,000, since I was getting only half of our original agreement. They said no.""",™

As much you try to deny it, arguing that the Iraq war was a good, much needed action is a central point to neocon theology. You might as well be proselytizing about Jesus then getting upset if I say it sounds like you're discussing Christianity.**    **And btw, calling it ""text-book"" doesn't denigrate it in the least, no more than saying that someone calling air pollution bad for the environment is such a ""text-book criticism"" of air pollution**.   *&gt;If taxes were raised on the rich and the war on drugs were to be ended there would be plenty of money to finance the wars.*  **That's true, but why would you want to spend it on killing more people?**  *&gt;I never mentioned WMD's at all as it doesn't pertain to the argument being made. The argument being that Saddam should of been removed in 1992 for the atrocities and genocide he committed.*   **Of course it's pertinent. Are you really so ridiculously naive that you believe that Bush and Co. took such elaborate measures to lie to the American people so that Bush could ""remove [Saddam] in 1992 for the atrocities and genocide he committed""? OK, baby-doll... you keep sucking that thumb.**  *&gt;Your logic on defeating terrorism is bullet proof too... To defeat terrorism we need to stop fighting terrorism?*   **Say, sweetie-pie... after a trillion dollars spent, did we defeat it yet? Hmmm, nope. What we did do however, is blow all the world-wide sympathy and good will we garnered after 9/11 and proceed to murder so many Iraqi men, women and children that we've created tenfold the number of potential anti-American terrorists that existed before. The CIA called it ""blowback"". Pick up a book and read about it.**   *&gt;You do realize the goal of the Mujahideen and surrogate groups is to restore the global Caliphate.*  **That's complete and utter bullshit. When I want to know what someone wants, I listen to them. They've publicly stated that they want us out of their holy lands and to stop meddling in their daily affairs. Again, the CIA agrees that this IS what they say. Of course, you're free to invent any reason you want for their behavior there, Glenn Beck.**  *&gt;Again, those domestic policy issues like the Patriot act, NDAA, etc, have nothing to do with the position being argued. Of course those things should be repealed but that is another topic.*  **Well, we agree they should be repealed, but again, if you really believe that the Patriot Act and NDAA have no connection to the war in Iraq, then tell me... why do they name Al-Queida™ and the War On terror™ as major reasons for their very existence?**  *&gt;This entire time you've been attacking a straw-man character that you have created. You have yet to respond to even 1 of my criticisms, instead opting to using your irrelevant talking points.*  **I've replied to ALL your points, and destroyed them, yet you deny them like the media denies Ron Paul.

Also during the war, USPC provided ""spotter"" cards, which illustrated the characteristic shapes of tanks, ships and aircraft from the more powerful countries.

Many people complain about the UI and the lack of explination about what skills do what... but it is a fun game. Just don't expect it to be perfect and enjoy the bizarre /unique setting. 	  **Aliens vs. Predator™** Pretty average shooter that does a great job capturing the AvP ""feel"" 	  **Frozen Synapse** If you like tactical turn based games, this is a must buy. Each turn is a few seconds and you can ""play though"" countless choices (for your units and the enemies) before deciding what you want to do. You can literally take hours pondering over an engagement that will last just a few minutes. The setting is cyberpunkish with a pretty solid single player campaign and multiplayer community. 	",™

But when you're a nice guy and want a good thing you're pushed to the side.""  Douchebag /do͞oSHbag/ (noun): anyone who invests enough time to be more attractive and successful in relationships than me, instead of wallowing in his own pool of self-pity.  I see posts like these from self-professed Nice Guys, complaining that women must WANT to be treated like shit, because they, the Nice Guys, have failed repeatedly in relationships. This is akin to the false logic that “whales are mammals, whales live in the sea, therefore all mammals live in the sea.” If you have one bad relationship after another, the only common denominator is you. Think about it.  What’s wrong with them? The biggest problem is that most Nice Guys ™ are hideously insecure. They are so anxious to be liked and loved that they do things for other people to gain acceptance and attention, rather than for the simply pleasure of giving. You never know if he really likes you for who you are, or if he has glommed onto you out of desperation because you actually paid some kind of attention to him.  Nice Guys think that they will never meet anyone as special as she is. They use their adoration as a foundation for claiming that “no one will ever love her as much as I do.” Instead of being a profound statement of their devotion, this is a subtle, but nasty insult. It is akin to saying this to her: you are a difficult person, and only *I* can ever truly love you, so be thankful I’m here. The nice guy needs to believe that he is the best person for the object of his desires, because otherwise his insecurities will overrun him with jealousies and fear. The truth is that there are many people out there who can be a good match for her. We rarely stop loving people we truly care about. Even if we no longer continue the relationship, the feelings will continue… But love isn’t mutually exclusive. We can (and do) love many people in our lives, and romantic love is really no different. Though he may love her immensely, there will likely be other people who have loved her just as much in her past, and will love her just as much in the future. The irony of it all is “who would want to go out with someone who was inherently unlovable anyway?”  More than loving the woman in his life, a Nice Guy NEEDS her. She is my Life, my only source of happiness… YECH! What kind of a burden is that to place on her? That SHE has to be responsible for YOUR happiness? Get a grip!  This ultimately boils down to the fact that Nice Guys ™ don’t like themselves. Is it any wonder women don’t like them? In order to truly love someone else, you must first love yourself. Nice Guys mistake obsession for “love”. You don’t have to be an ego-inflated, arrogant jerk. You just have to LIKE yourself. You have to know what you want out of life, and go after it. Only then will you be attractive to the kind of woman with whom a long-term relationship is possible.  ForestRaptor posted: ""Myth busted. I asked this girl out, I got denied and fell back to the friend zone.""  The whole ""friend zone"" idea is such a crock of egotistical shit. That concept hinges on the assumption that everyone you meet of the opposite sex SHOULD want to have sex with you.  A lot of peple seem to think that it's somehow dishonest for a woman to befriend a man without telling him that this is never going to lead to sex. They're wrong. ""This will eventually lead to sex"" is not the default state of a male-female friendship, and unless he specifically exhibits an interest in that, then you have no way of knowing that the guy is secretly in love with you or whatever. If you have a friend that you want to have sex with, you can't fucking blame them for just treating you like a friend, because as far as they know, that's all you are.  Edited:  And don't forget; guys and gals are much, much more alike than we could possibly think — both sexes don’t realize how much they have in common, because people just talk about the opposite one in terms of tropes and stereotypes, and ignore situations that don’t fit their preconceptions. And people don’t talk about their own feelings and experiences unless there is already an existing framework of stereotypes to validate it. (and most of those are brought to you by ad-funded television)  So if I were you, I wouldn't start overanalyzing body language :p",™

t5_2s4k5,edit1754,1324735949,"Resolution tends to makes more of a difference than any other spec because it affects everything you do. Higher resolutions let you fit more onscreen at once and make a significant difference for productivity and multitasking. Not only that, most 15.6"" 1366x768 screens have significantly worse quality than 15.6"" 1920x1080-resolution screens and (some) 15.6"" 1600x900 resolution screens. 1600x900 in a 17.3"" screen is quite a poor size/resolution combo as well.  Resolution should actually be a category on your spreadsheet. It's way more important than RAM, which is a category. RAM is irrelevant at the time of purchase because you can always upgrade it later and because RAM past 4GB usually doesn't make much of a difference.  Also it's safe to assume that all 15.6"" and 17.3"" Toshiba Satellites have bad screens. I've never seen a Toshiba Satellite with a screen any better than the worst available for its size.  - Same goes for Acer Aspires.  -------  You say the XPS 15 and XPS 15z have bad graphics cards because they have the nVidia 525M? The 525M is actually lot closer to the 540M than to the 520M in performance.

It is difficult to figure out what the options for the GPU mean. Once HP clears this up, it should be good to go to order a DV6t or DV7t from their configuration page and the **NBT3886** coupon. Remember: You need the 1920x1080 display and the Radeon 6770M GPU. Those need to be present in the config, everything else is second and should only be considered after these upgrades are in place. Go for a lower base model (ex: regular DV6t instead of the Quad Edition) if necessary, in order to ensure you have **both** of these upgrades in your configuration at a low enough price after the coupon. Note about the coupon: It only works when the final config price is $899+",®

t5_2qka0,NotEvenCloseToFunny,1324753513,"You appear to be missing the point. It's okay. I understand. It's hard. The two weapons I listed are Upgrades™. Pure and simple. The Tomislav removes, not reduces, removes spinup time without any complimentary downside. The extra time taken to fire each individual bullet is meaningless as the damage done over the important first few seconds of firing isn't reduced. It is, in fact, increased when compared with a vanilla heavy firing and having to contend with his spinup time. Due to the removal of spinup time, the Tomislav heavy is capable of dealing more damage more quickly without a downside. The downside of the Tomislav only comes into play after several seconds of continued firing, after which most people will be long dead because the heavy commands the most powerful hitscan weapon in the game. Before that threshold is reached it is better, unequivocally, than any of the other miniguns--most importantly Sasha. See [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBT0v1VmBaY).  The Enforcer confers an extra 20% damage done **Without A Downside When Paired With The Dead Ringer**. This isn't up for debate. The downside, the only downside of the gun, **Doesn't Apply** to that watch. This has nothing to do with tactics or skill or any of your weak, weak rebuttals. Nothing. Nothing. It's simple math. These two weapons confer an unfair advantage to those who have them over those who don't. They are better than their stock counterparts in too many situations to be allowed, and are thus, if we take the stock to be the standard by which OP-ness is to be judged, OP.   Look at SPUF. Look at those forums, look past the shit of course. Look at the Heavy and Spy subforums. All my arguments have been made before, far more eloquently than presented here, and they were made months ago. Valve hasn't responded. Instead, they have released updates filled with worthless nonsense. Cosmetics mostly, but also a few stupid weapons like the new flamethrower and the trolling gloves. Granted this update has a few things worthy of note: The Spycicle and the Manmelter are at least worthy of consideration. Although in my opinion the Spycicle makes both pyros and the spies using it useless to their respective teams by reducing or removing their key utilities i.e spychecking and, you know, killing people. But they are, at least, not worthless.  The Christmas lights on guns deal is indicative of Valve's desire to put off creating actual, worthwhile content in favor of stupid stupid shit that they can get idiots to pay for. And if they were putting that stuff out while still maintaining the balance of the classes and responding quickly to new bugs and crashes I wouldn't have a problem. But they aren't doing that. They aren't even trying. The two weapons I listed were released with the Uber Update half a year ago. The Tomislav was nerfed once, not nearly to the extent it needs to be, soon after, but the Enforcer has never been touched. Remember the crashes that came with the Manniversary Update? The ones that took weeks to be addressed fully? And there are still a lot of complaints of crashes and framerate issues that haven't been addressed or even acknowledged by Valve. They don't care anymore. Look at what they did, look at how great and inventive the Goldrush Update was. Look at how FUN and CREATIVE the War Update was. Look at how stupid this update is. Christmas lights on guns and a flamethrower that doesn't have an airblast. Holy shit.",™

Bush administration. Brownback hired Siedlecki this year to be Kansas’s secretary of social and rehabilitation services.  Siedlecki cut dozens of jobs, closed offices, doubled the size of the team that investigates welfare cheats and rewrote state contracts to encourage providers of state services to promote pro-fatherhood and pro-family ideals. He also hired a Florida pastor, Rick Marks, to head the state’s new healthy-marriage initiative. Marks has been described by some as the state’s “marriage guru.”  After less than a year on the job, Siedlecki resigned this month. But some of his legacy remains.  To help fund its new fatherhood initiative, Kansas has shifted $600,000 from an Early Head Start program in Riley County, which has double the state’s percentage of residents in poverty. Head Start officials said they already have strong fatherhood programming in place and that they would rather have used those funds to get children off the waiting list for day care.  “Dr. Marks — we have a ‘marriage guru’ now — came out to our program, and he was shocked at all the things we do at Head Start,” said Korey Hensley, the director of Heartland Early Education in Salina. “He said, ‘Oh, you do family preservation!’ I said, ‘Absolutely.’ ”  As the opening session of the state legislature approaches in January, officials are preparing for another bruising budget battle. Brownback plans to revamp the state’s tax system with cuts to the income tax rates and plans to change the 20-year-old funding formula for schools, a move that opponents fear could benefit wealthier districts.  “It will be a bloodbath,” said state Sen. Laura Kelly, a Democrat. “There’s going to be a raft of things that will come, but details are lacking. It’s all been so clandestine.”  For his part, Brownback sounded a triumphant note during his recent speech in Wichita.  “We’ve started our reforms,” he said. “It’s going to take some time. We’ve gotten off to a good start.”  Staff researcher Magda Jean-Louis contributed to this report.  © The Washington Post Company",©

Either the NDP gets trounced by the Bloc at the next election, or most of the NDP’s Québec caucus splits and makes another Bloc (like when the Bloc formed when the Tories’ Québec caucus split after Charlottetown).

Extra sexy.  :) (I have no idea where I got this one so I can't give credit, sorry)  Lemon Ginger Syrup (enough for 8 drinks; easily doubles or triples)  1 3-inch piece of fresh ginger, peeled and thinly sliced 2 cups water 1 1/2 cups white sugar (use light brown sugar for a smokier, earthier taste) grated zest of one lemon 1 cup fresh lemon juice  In a small saucepan, combine the sliced ginger with the water and sugar and bring to a simmer over a moderate heat. Simmer for five minutes, then let the ginger syrup cool. Transfer to a blender and puree. Strain the syrup into a glass jar. Stir in the lemon zest and juice.  When you are ready to make your martinis add 2 ounces vodka and 2 ounces lemon-ginger syrup into a cocktail shaker over ice. Shake. Strain into a martini glass and add a small ribbon of lemon peel as a garnish.  edit: still on the site, check out some of the others... ",®

t5_2qh5j,Wilmot_Pioneer,1324871928,"I find it endlessly frustrating when I see on the news and hear from my friends and family the criticism of the Occupy movement over purported lack of leadership and lack of a solid goal. It's really frightening to see this lack of open mindedness to a social structure that isn't unified under ONE idea or organized into a monolithic hierarchy. People keep saying, ""What this movement really needs is a LEADER."" I entirely disagree with that. I think what's really profound about the Occupy movement is the example that is being set for how a community can make collective decisions. The work groups have done really cool stuff in the last few months and I think that the last few decades have shown that a leadership-oriented movement isn't going to solve any of our problems.   I'm really kind of frightened by the criticism of the ""lack of leadership"" because that shows that people are really blatantly missing the point. The point being people can operate OUTSIDE of that hierarchical structure and these people are proving that every day. Also, by suggesting that the movement needs a leader they're obviously not seeing - or not being shown by the media - the great work that is being done WITHOUT a leader. It seems that the every day citizens want exactly what the media wants: a celebrity that will stand up and speak out for the Occupy movement as a front page story for a few weeks and then be relegated to the recycling bin of hype for the Next Big Story™.

I♥Dick  EDIT: Follow-up to this - I kept the sign, because it was pretty darn funny. So fast forward a few years and I'm moving apartments in medical school, and a few of my buddies helping me move find the sign in my closet. They take it, making sure I don't see them, and proceed to put it up in the front window of my new apartment. I have no idea how, but I never noticed it. We kept moving stuff on into the night, and at about 2 AM I finally see it. It'd been up there for about 14 hours.  My neighbors in that complex never spoke to me...  EDIT EDIT: Little late now, but another funny part was that it was technically from my mother. She gave my little brother money to ""buy him some shoes or something"" and he came home with this, and wrapped it before she could see it.

t5_2t5sa,hiddenlakes,1324917410,"It's sometimes difficult to accept that there is a system through which you benefit to the detriment of another group, and that you can't do anything on an *individual* level to relieve yourself of culpability - essentially, that you will always be part of the oppressor group whether you like it or not.  For example, in coming to terms with my white privilege I went through a period of dissonance. Honestly, at first I really felt like people were out to make me personally responsible for all racism. People would tell me about how great it was to be white in this culture, and inform me that I was on the receiving end of benefits that were denied to others, but it was hard to see the forest for the trees. All I could really see was my own side of the problem. It really did seem (for a time) that white people were being generalized and stereotyped unfairly. It took a thorough researching of the concept of privilege and a smack in the face history lesson for me to realize my logical errors.   I think a lot of people who blame feminism for gender roles are looking for a scapegoat so they won't ever have to unpack and dismantle their privilege. There was no problem before women started complaining and trying to *change* things! Now they're having to learn all these new terms, to see their role in society in a different light, to question their own assumptions about gender roles, and it's uncomfortable and unpleasant. It means seeing themselves as part of an oppressive system when, to their minds, they've never benefited from privilege and they've never oppressed anyone. It's much easier to believe that we're all oversensitive, hysterical bitches trying to get an edge over men in the Gender War™. ",™

I’m not a producer [yet, but I am definitely working towards that ☺] but I’ve just picked up mixing and have my first gig coming up in two months – and I can tell you, I spent a lot of time becoming a hermit researching, reading forums, learning how to midi map, studying and practicing alone in my room and I now understand why there aren’t many girls in the EDM industry.  We were raised to play with Barbies, baby dolls, and have imaginary tea parties and bake imaginary cupcakes.  And boys, you got remote controlled race cars, Legos, video games, etc - problem solving, building, and learning about technology at an early age.  It’s the same reason why there aren’t many female gamers.  Lucky for me I always liked video games more than Barbies… haha.  But seriously, it’s just unnatural (in general) for females to sit in their rooms alone for hours working on anything that has to do with electronics, not because we’re not smart enough.

t5_2s46m,F00LY,1324974992,"So I complain to my girlfriend alllllll the time how much I hate shaving. It hurts, its boring, it takes forever, it has to be done way too often and its expensive.  What does she do? Hints that I am getting a new razor for Xmas. ..........   I open my gift and to my pleasant surprise it just *looks* fancier than the normal cartridges I have to deal with.  That AND there is a book. Being as I am on break from college, I can actually read said book!  What did I get in total? * 1 Badger Hair Brush * 1 Merkur Futur Razor * 5 Tris Blades * 1 Shaving Soap [Not sure which brand!] * Leisureguy's Guide to Gourmet Shaving * An awesome orange towel * A Styptic Pencil (Burns, but works wonders!)  That said, I shaved today very excitedly for the first time.  I showered first, and then held a towel to my facial hair for a minute or so before hand, alas I should have put the first layer of lather on.  Also while it wasn't particularly thick, I felt like I was having an okay time making the lather. Even enjoying it.  Then it came time to go across the grain.  This was slightly harder, but still worked well. And while the guide said not to, I had to try against the grain.  WTG and XTG just did not remove enough hair for me to be comfortable with the shave.  This is where things got...painful.  I cut myself several times, though I learned a lot in the process. I was holding the blade VERY light and not pushing much at all. I feel like perhaps the blade was bad. As recommended, I plan to try a few more times before switching though.  That said, he recommends early on getting a sampler pack. Is there a specific sampler anyone recommends?  Furthermore, what about a specific preshave soap?  For an aftershave I am currently using Nivea for Men Sensitive Post shave balm.  Thanks to my girlfriend for the gifts ♥ Also, Thanks to any help you all can give!

t5_2r9vp,silverbullet1,1324998168,"The most popular artificial sweetener in cola beverages is aspartame, which has been cleared again and again by double blind studies.   Did you even read the page you posted? It essentially proves my point.   From your link.   &gt;However, results from subsequent carcinogenicity studies (studies that examine whether a substance can cause cancer) of these sweeteners have not provided clear evidence of an association with cancer in humans.  and   &gt;Aspartame  Aspartame, distributed under several trade names (e.g., NutraSweet® and Equal®), was approved in 1981 by the FDA after numerous tests showed that it did not cause cancer or other adverse effects in laboratory animals. Questions regarding the safety of aspartame were renewed by a 1996 report suggesting that an increase in the number of people with brain tumors between 1975 and 1992 might be associated with the introduction and use of this sweetener in the United States. However, an analysis of then-current NCI statistics showed that the overall incidence of brain and central nervous system cancers began to rise in 1973, 8 years prior to the approval of aspartame, and continued to rise until 1985. Moreover, increases in overall brain cancer incidence occurred primarily in people age 70 and older, a group that was not exposed to the highest doses of aspartame since its introduction. These data do not establish a clear link between the consumption of aspartame and the development of brain tumors.  In 2005, a laboratory study found more lymphomas and leukemias in rats fed very high doses of aspartame (equivalent to drinking 8 to 2,083 cans of diet soda daily) (1). However, there were some inconsistencies in the findings. For example, the number of cancer cases did not rise with increasing amounts of aspartame as would be expected. An FDA statement on this study can be found at http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/2006/ucm108650.htm on the Internet.  Subsequently, NCI examined human data from the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study of over half a million retirees. Increasing consumption of aspartame-containing beverages was not associated with the development of lymphoma, leukemia, or brain cancer (2).  All from your link.   &gt;Coke contains caffeine, so it does have an physical and psychological addictive property.  It's addictive qualities are hardly extreme in a physical sense, and anything can be psychologically addictive. ",®

I've noticed (in many different Orlando locations at many different times) that the modem they give you when you have phone service sucks ASS compared to the regular motorolla modem they give you when you're just getting internet access.  When I've had just internet it's been on 100% of the time, when I get the modem with VOIP included it drops all the time.

Get rid of the phone bundle and you'll be golden.  edit: Alternatively you can buy your own motorolla surfboard modem and call them up and tell them you want to use your own equipment, give them the identifying information and they'll connect it to their network.

New people entering this pool can be immigrants, canadian migrants, people coming of age, people separating and any other form of splitting or additions.  I can make the assumption that on any given day there are more ""rent/buy eligible"" people entering the city than any amount of homes being bough or sold.  As for my theory on housing prices I believe it is a supply and demand issue.   There is limited supply and demand is high.    As with anything in this case prices will rise.   Couple that with historically low interest rates and you have the perfect storm.   How can we fix it?  Increase supply, Vancouver is adding coach homes and other measures.  And decrease demand by raising interest rates.   Some facts:   http://www.akcanada.com/lic_vancouver.cfm ""During the period of 2001 to 2006 Vancouver became home to 151,695 new Canadian immigrants.

t5_2sgq6,Shurikane,1325108145,"&gt; I'm a little confused about why you want co-op games where you aren't cooperating though.   I'll explain via my own personal experience.  The latest co-op games I played, namely Left4Dead and Alien Swarm, were either not challenging enough, or too challenging.  We could play in normal difficulty and breeze through the level without really trying, or we could get utterly punished for every mistake we made.  Normal diff was a boredom, expert diff caused team breakdowns as teammates began screaming at each other.  There was also a mentality that the level must be completed, which did not exist in the coin-op days.  The reason I do not like dependency at the level I see now, is because I no longer thank a teammate for helping me, but I berate him for not helping me.  L4D designed some situations where a player is helpless and *must* be saved by someone else.  But I can no longer count the times where someone got pounced on and his own teammates left him in the dust.  The game environment itself was filled with miasma.  I went and played a round of Gunstar Heroes to remind myself of some key elements.  I found something best described as the **""Watch-This! Factor""**  Not trying to coin a new term here, but trying to convey it in just a few words.  Gunstar had a flurry of moves at one's disposal.  Multiple weapons, power-slides, bodyslams, throws.  Some of those moves were situational but it was fun to watch someone do them.  Some weapons were extremely powerful while others required more finesse.  You built and tweaked your own challenge in a way.  And as I recalled games with friends, we'd attempt crazy things.  It's not a feeling I get of the games I play now, at least those that are multiplayer co-op.  The organisation is more... SWAT-like, I feel.  There's little room for error, and most of those games have friendly fire which I *know* is a surefire way to burn a social bridge in two seconds flat.  The gameplay sequence becomes formulaic, like a script that must be followed.  It's about optimization rather than fooling around and and saying ""Hey, I betcha can't do this!""  Most players who don't follow the unspoken script get the boot on the basis that they don't know how to play properly, and the playerbase knows that most sub-optimal solutions mean death.  L4D is a particularly punishing example of this dynamic since if a player dies, the game is immediately made tougher for the others, not only due to there being one less gun shooting around, but because the number of enemies does not diminish, so it's the beginning of a slippery slope to demise.  *The worst player determines the team's performance.*  Then all of a sudden there's this magical moment when one lone survivor manages to sprint through half of the level, fighting the odds and causing much hilarity among both teams.  Well, that's something we can capitalize on, I think!  Let's put something out there for a moment: what if there is a co-op game where players, individually, are given a chance to shine?  Where someone can optionally take on a more ""spotlight"" role and perform a smooth move.  Where there are multiple ways to approach a challenge and some are difficult but rewarded with a satisfying visual, or animation, or big-ass explosion.  Where the best player in the team determines team performance, where even if only one player is left, his success means the success of everyone too.  Where the storyline dynamic and character interaction is treated less like a dire situation and more like participating in a sport, doing trick shots, cheering your buddy when he pulls one off and laughing exaggeratedly when he screws up and falls flat on his face, people yelling ""Awright, let's do this!""  Where there's no visible scoreboard per se but the team's MVP is rewarded by the other player characters commenting on his good job, or how he was on fire today.  Building an atmosphere where it's about the going towards some goal, and being fancy with it, accomplish the level like you're a skater and between you and your destination are bunches of railing and ramps and jumps, and you and the other players up the ante on how much of a crazy stunt you can pull off.  If we're expected to have assurance to complete the level, then the level itself must be the experience, the playground, and I don't believe that mechanically adjusting the level's difficulty is the right way to promote that playground; I feel it's up to the player to choose how much of a bite he or she can chew, and if he bites off more than he can chew, then yeah he might explode in a bloody pulp but game-mechanics wise his death should be a slap on the wrist.  I don't subscribe to the notion of ""difficult = strength"".  I don't want a teammate who can beat some level's Expert mode in 10 minutes with handcuffs.  I want a teammate with personality, with a distinct voice and style.  Some of my greatest gaming moments were with people I spoke and interacted with.  Either we were pulling off the Ultimate Assault Plan of Deadly Doom™, or we were actually doing nothing special but one of us was piss-drunk, came from a foreign country, was pushing his accent to hilarious levels and was spewing out dead baby jokes while betting we couldn't make a vehicle jump over a big rock by using a stack of grenades.  (Oh God wall of text.)  Anyway, hope you get where I'm coming from with this.  :)  Thanks if you read all the way through to here.  **tl;dr:** Team well-being should be in function of the best player, not the worst player.  Team should focus on pulling stunts rather than simply accomplishing an objective.  ",™

t5_2qh6c,theram4,1325116785,"I recently read the book [The Bondage Breaker](http://www.amazon.com/Bondage-Breaker®-Neil-T-Anderson/dp/0736902414) by Neil T Anderson. In it, the author makes the point that we ought to get rid of anything that resembles demonic power, because if we allow even the slightest foothold, Satan will take that foothold and try to increase his power over our lives.  Here's the thing. Some people are very spiritually weak. For these weak, I would not recommend things like yoga or any other activity that has it's roots in mysticism. For the strong, they realize that there is nothing inherently wrong about yoga, acupuncture, or any of the things you mentioned. We are strong enough to base on faith on the true healing power of Jesus Christ.   But again, there are many who might get into these things and delve ever more into mysticism or satanism. It's all how we look at things. The Bible makes it clear that we shouldn't just make rules for the sake of making rules, and especially not to prevent others from exercising their freedoms they have in Christ. But we also shouldn't put a stumbling block in anyone's way, especially not in our own way.",®

t5_2qh03,depleater,1325120824,"This interview is a thing of surreal beauty, despite [kre8rix's valid point](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/ntw92/christforo_still_only_sorry_because_of_who_mike/c3bx39w) about the article author (Kyle Orland) not making it explicit that Christoforo was lying about (or, at the very least, *grossly* misrepresenting) Mike's ""booth will be cancelled"" email. I don't know if Kyle did it deliberately because he wanted to let the full effect of Christoforo's Aura-of-Douchebagginess™ shine through, but that seemed to be the result.  &gt; He's blaming everyone else for his idiocy.  “They've pretty much ruined me in the past 24 hours”  **They** ruined **me**. Ye gods. :)  &gt; This was not an isolated incident of his douchebaggery and fuckwittery. He's treated people like this before, [...]  “I've dealt with thousands and thousands of customers with similar complaints, they were all asking the same question. When is it big enough that it hits the news?”  ...He actually **said** that. To a journalist.  &gt; [...] and this time it blew up in his face.  “I could have nipped this all in the bud by being a little nicer.”  I love the way he characterises it as “being a *little* nicer” rather than “**not** being a complete and utter lying fucktard bully”.  It'd be interesting to have a chat with some of the people that went through highschool with this guy. I think he'd have been one of the nastiest of bullies in that environment.  &gt; Instead of laying low he's coming out and acting the victim.  “At the end of the day, I'm a human being, and it feels like the entire world was bullying me”  Call the fucking [wahmbulance](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=wahmbulance). &lt;eyeroll&gt;  “You never know who knows who, and lesson learned.”  The only lesson he *seems* to have learned is that when he bullies, threatens and/or abuses people in future, that he should do it on the phone.  (It may be a shock for him when he finds out that phone calls can also be recorded and put on the internet.)  “Not that I don't have respect for anybody, but if someone's badmouthing me or being a little punk or being a jerk, they don't deserve respect,”  I think [TheEleventhDoctor has got it right](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/ntw92/christforo_still_only_sorry_because_of_who_mike/c3by1p4), Christoforo's a narcissist. He seems unwilling (unable?) to accept any possibility that there could be a valid reason to ""badmouth"" him.",™

It's not completely true though, as socialism has its share of downsides.  But I think a lot of the reason for the negative view on socialism in America stems from The American Dream™ and historically from the cold war and McCarthyism where the enemy = communists.  From what I can tell, the american political spectrum is shifted compared to Europe. American ""right wing"" is ""left wing"" in Europe. american ""middle"" is ""far left wing"" in europe, and american ""right wing"" is ""right wing extremists"" in europe.

I've killed people 1v2 because they got too close to my tower with no creeps and I flash+ E them and they take a bunch of tower hits. Of all the things that Vayne has, this one bothers me the most.

t5_2snuc,MisterFlibble,1325182210,"I'm suggesting that no matter how I define Christianity or what remark I make about it, even if it's correct according to the majority of Christianity, I will be told I'm wrong.  So according to my experiences, yes.  Atheists, on the other hand, will mostly agree that both people to believe there is no god and people who lack a belief in god are both atheists.  You'll rarely see an atheist using a True Scotsman fallacy regarding another atheist, unless the rest of the population agrees.  Christians, on the other hand, all think they *are* ""True© Christians"", yet can barely agree amongst themselves on what that actually *is*.  All they know is that if an atheist gives their two cents on what it means, it will be wrong... because they are atheist.  &gt;.&gt;  Case in point, I call anyone who believes Jesus is the Son of God and Christ a Christian.  This includes Mormons and Catholics because that is what they believe.  Baptists will largely be quick to disagree.",©

Prep Time: 30 Minutes  Cook Time: 6 Hours  Ready In: 6 Hours 30 Minutes  Servings: 8   INGREDIENTS:  2 tablespoons olive oil  3 tablespoons all-purpose flour  2 pounds beef chuck, cut into 1 1/2-inch cubes  1 pound carrots, peeled and cut into 1-inch chunks  6 large potatoes, peeled and cut into large chunks  1 white onion, cut into large chunks  2 cloves garlic, minced  2 cups beef broth  1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste  1 (12 fluid ounce) can or bottle Irish stout beer (e.g. Guinness®)  1 tablespoon cold water  1 tablespoon cornstarch   DIRECTIONS:  1.	Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Toss beef cubes with flour to coat, then fry in the hot oil until browned. Place the carrots, potatoes, onion and garlic in a large slow cooker. Place the meat on top of the vegetables. Mix together the beef broth and tomato paste and pour into the slow cooker along with the beer.  2.	Cover and cook in a crock pot (slow cooker) on High for 6 hours or Low for 8 hours. During the last hour before serving, dissolve the cornstarch in cold water and then stir into the broth. Simmer on the High setting for a few minutes to thicken.",®

t5_2qqom,PrettyCoolGuy,1325186428,"I wouldn't buy it.  It seems really wasteful (I don't really like using paper plates and that sort of thing).  Is this even real? It sounds like a joke.  The website says ""One of many reasons for using a Hexa Pot™ instead of using traditional pots is to save time. Instead of having to wash the pots, you can toss them in the recycle bin trash. Time you would spend scraping, rinsing, washing *and putting them away* can be used for other things instead.""  Time I would have spent *putting it away*?  Are you fucking high?  (Not OP, the the creator of this thing).  Time I would have spent putting it away?  That's a new level of lazy.  As for using this in a survival situation, that's an even more dubious claim.  If you are going to survive with something it must be durable.  A paper pot doesn't sound like a good choice.  Just get a titanium pot from snow peak.  It weighs hardly anything (4.5 ounces), is extremely durable and isn't that big.  I realize this is a very strong, negative reaction.  I just see a product that is wasteful and makes some pretty extreme claims.  ""Can be a blessing on your hands due to it being a disposable product, no dish washing is required. ""  A blessing?  Because you can just throw it away?  ""Safe alternative cookware when compared to your traditional stainless steel pots and pans that may produce harmful health effects caused from iron, nickel and chromium.""  Really? Show me some studies.  Now, I know there is some controversy about the safety of, say, aluminum cookware.  I have to say I think the risks are probably overstated, and, to be sure, I've yet to see any studies that have strongly linked the use of aluminum to Alzheimer's and other health risks.  There are concerns, but nothing more.  As far as I am aware, all metals are safe to use for cooking.  Related to this, I'm more convinced that exposing certain types of plastics (mostly soft plastics and plastics with BPA) to very high temperatures (like boiling water) is believed to leach BPA and other plastics into food/water.  So I kind of wonder what sort of heat-proof coatings the HexaPot uses and how safe they are.  As you can see, I'm quite fired up about this.  I probably need to calm the fuck down, but damnit, I think someone on the Internet (i.e. the Hexapot people) is wrong!",™

t5_2qh2a,Prettym1k3,1325201015,"I took a class at WPPI last year that absolutely changed my workflow in Lightroom.  My very first order of business is to sync cameras.  Having a second body, or a back-up shooter's camera even 5-10 seconds off of my own is super frustrating, and while you can change that in Lightroom, it may never be 100% perfect.  So start there.  As for my filing system, I'm a PC guy, and use folders.  They're all in a main ""Prettym1k3's Photography"" folder.  From there, I sub-folder into Automotive, Children, Families, Architecture, Weddings, etc.  Then I sub-folder again into the name of the car's owner, the couple's name, the family name, etc.  Then inside of each of those folders I keep folders for Blog, Jpeg, RAW Images, etc.  I do weddings, so after importing 1:1 rendered images and sorting them by date and time taken, I go through and I pick (using the ""P"" key) and flag my good images.  Then I go through again, and unpick (using the ""U"" key) the ones I realized were duplicates or ones that weren't up to par.  Then I go through and have my wife 1 star (using the ""1"" key) any images she doesn't like.  Then I review.  I 5 star (using the ""5"" key) anything I plan to blog or leak onto my Facebook page early.  Then I edit in LR, and move to CS5 when necessary.  When uploading into Lightroom, I always pull files straight from the folder that they're in on my computer.  So when I offload memory cards, I move the physical files into their proper folders on my C:/ drive.  I never import and make a duplicate copy through Lightroom.  I've had problems doing that in the past.  As for everything else, I use descriptions.  Each photoshoot I do, and each family gathering I get ""volunteered"" to shoot for my personal family, I use names of people, dates, locations (city, state, landmarks) and the even name (wedding, family shoot, birthday, anniversary, etc.).  Remember to insert your Copyright metadata into Lightroom and use it for ALL of your images.  Every single one.  Yay for Facebook, if you have it.  Facebook will read certain portions of your metadata or programmed copyright information (if you can do that with your camera - my D7000 and D700 will do that) and read it.  So under each image I host on Facebook it says ""© Prettym1k3 Photography 2011"".  Sorry if that didn't fully answer your question, but hope that helps.  I think I jumped around a little bit.  In the end, sitting down with someone who has a complete and smooth system, learning what they do, and making adjustments to better fit your style/goals is key.  I've had a few people come over for a little sit down sesh and, as I'm told, they feel 100% better when they leave.  For perspective, the last wedding I shot I ended up with 4,500 images.  Culled down to 1,100 in 3 hours.  Culled down to 900 in another hour.  Fully edited in an additional 4 hours, including blemish removal, B&amp;W conversions, etc.  (Not bragging, just intending to show that the system I use works for me quite well).",©

t5_2qh13,darkwasthenight,1325209569,"Well, it's a pretty big problem when it comes to acoustic guitars. The nut and saddle are often made from ivory. It's usually marketed as ""pre-ban"" material, but I think it's pretty shameful to have a ""pre-ban"" stockpile of these guitar parts or (more likely) to just get it fresh and lie about it.  Anyway, it does lend a different sound to a guitar. For those looking for an ivory sound without the guilt, Tusq® is a synthetic material that is very common which many guitar makers like Taylor have opted for due to its sound being a bit more open in the lower end than ivory.  Still, real ivory does sound *different*, and it's a sound that some people want. Those people should just buy old guitars that already have ivory in 'em, though.",®

t5_2qhnf,bobbaphet,1325209980,"&gt;Are you saying that there are buddhist concepts which are not readily provable, but which are ~~expected~~ beneficial to be believed by some buddhists?  &gt;Or are you saying that sometimes, in buddhism, you have to have confidence or reasonable expectation of an outcome based on observable evidence?  I'm saying yes to both because that is what the Buddha taught. With one slight alteration of the first statement, that I indicated in the quote.   Thanissaro Bhikkhu, one of the prominent pali translators, explains it in great depth for anyone who is interested.   [Faith In Awakening by Thanissaro Bhikkhu © 2006–2011](http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/faithinawakening.html)  The Buddha never placed unconditional demands on anyone's faith. And for anyone from a culture where the dominant religions do place such demands on one's faith, this is one of Buddhism's most attractive features. We read his famous instructions to the Kalamas, in which he advises testing things for oneself, and we see it as an invitation to believe, or not, whatever we like. Some people go so far as to say that faith has no place in the Buddhist tradition, that the proper Buddhist attitude is one of skepticism.  But even though the Buddha recommends tolerance and a healthy skepticism toward matters of faith, he also makes a conditional request about faith: If you sincerely want to put an end to suffering — that's the condition — you should take certain things on faith, as working hypotheses, and then test them through following his path of practice. +++++++++++  He then goes on to explain how a western view inherently misinterprets Buddhist faith.

When we are concentrating on something, like a computer screen, we tend not to blink as often and this can dry out our eyes. Purposeful blinking or closing the eyes for short periods of time when reading, watching T.V. or working on a computer may help alleviate dry eye symptoms.      Eligibility  The Dry Eye Disease Study is a Canada-wide randomized trial investigating the effectiveness of a new eye drop formulation against commonly used eye drops named Refresh® Tears.  Men and women over the age of 18 who experience symptoms of dry, burning, itching eyes may qualify to participate.   Other symptoms of dry eye disease include red eye, a pulling sensation on the eye, the feeling that something is in the eye, blurred vision, tiredness and increased sensitivity to light.   Dry eye disease is caused when there is an imbalance between tear production and tear evaporation.  Factors that can alter this balance include aging, contact lens use, eye strain and exposure to dry and extreme weather conditions.

t5_2qlqh,adrianmonk,1325284278,"&gt; It looks like you are also using GPS which uses lots of power  Using *navigation* uses a lot of power.  The GPS chip itself, as far as I can tell does not.  * According to the [ifixit teardown](http://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Samsung-Galaxy-Nexus-Teardown/7182/2), specifically step 12, the GPS chip that the Galaxy Nexus contains is a ""SiRF SiRFstarIV GSD4t GPS tracker"". * According to [its product product page](http://www.csr.com/products/25/sirfstariv-gsd4t), it uses ""8mW (typical) TricklePower™ at 1Hz update rate"".  Since USB is 5V, in order to deliver 8mW of power over USB, the phone only needs to draw 1.6 mA.  USB supplies 500 mA at a minimum.  So, accounting for power conversion and stuff, a reasonable guesstimate is that **the actual GPS chip is probably using less than 1% of what a USB charger supplies**.  The GPS chip is not the biggest culprit, not by far.  The problem with navigation is that it combines together several power-hungry pieces of hardware:  * The screen * The network (for fetching maps it displays) * The CPU * The GPU * The audio chip and the speaker * Sensors (GPS, but also probably compass and possibly accelerometer and orientation sensors)  Basically, navigation uses the majority of the hardware on your phone, all at once.  That's the reason it drains battery so fast.  I've found for long-distance trips, I personally like to preserve battery power by simply pushing the power button.  The screen turns off, but I still get voice navigation.  Then I'm not burning power to light the screen, nor am I burning power (CPU, GPU) to render maps in real time.",™

Are you suggesting that he shouldn't be friends with them simply because they're women who aren't interested in being anything more than friends, and are therefore wasting his time? That's nice guys™.   Or are you suggesting that he shouldn't be friends or anything more than that with people who he doesn't want to spend time around because they're simply unpleasant to be around? That's just a matter of self respect and self worth. It has nothing to do with being nice or not. And it's also sort of irrelevant, I think. As Ducky-box pointed out, girls are just human. Therefore, they shouldn't be treated any differently for just being girls. If you don't enjoy their company, don't hang out with them. If you do enjoy their company, but they don't want to be romantic with you, be their friend. If you do enjoy their company and they do want to be romantic with you, then you're golden.   ""Nice"" doesn't have anything to do with it, really. Also, ""'Nice guy' trap""? What the fuck, man? That's the 'Nice Guy™' coming through again. ",™
t5_2qzb6,wonderkittypunk,1325287005,"Your story is amazing. I am so happy for you that you have been able to achieve what so many struggle with on a daily basis. As a side note, I will tell you that you are definitely a great looking guy. I know that all the compliments in the world can't help you with a low self-image, but over time you will realize how attractive you are, and life will be excellent for you. ♥  I can tell you that I personally have struggled with weight for 12 years now. I got a pituitary tumor when I was a senior in HS, and due to the hormonal and emotional issues I went through, I gained a -lot- of weight.   I have tried so many different ways to lose weight, and have been unable to drop any. I have actually gained, and currently at 29 I stand 5'9"" and weigh 320 lbs. I am a female, and have always had body/self image issues, even when I was thin (but didn't realize it).  My mom suggests I get a gastric bypass so that I can lose weight, and then continue my current methods to keep it off. I walk at least a mile every day, and workout in the gym. I eat very little, and sometimes not at all. The depression gets so bad sometimes that I will sink under the weight of it (no pun intended  &gt;_&lt;) and just binge on all the sweet crap foods I can fit in my face.   I hope one day I can post some amazing before/after photos here like you did to join the ranks of healthy people proud of their accomplishments.  :)",♥

t5_2rxrw,significantshrinkage,1325292075,"&gt;Or are you suggesting that he shouldn't be friends or anything more than that with people who he doesn't want to spend time around because they're simply unpleasant to be around  I'm suggesting that. And it is relevant. Being nice is what being friends with someone entails. It's part of it. I'm talking about the guys who don't care about just friendships with women if it won't lead to a romantic relationship(which is the majority I think, and it isn't unreasonable either. I have enough friends as it is. I don't need anymore of them, who all need a certain level of commitment and attention). It is indeed a matter of self respect when it comes to ignoring your own needs, giving random people all my attention, which is what these ""nice guys"" do. Then they turn bitter because their ""sacrifice"" wasn't appreciated. No shit it wasn't appreciated, and for good reason.  &gt; What the fuck, man? That's the 'Nice Guy™' coming through again.  What exactly are you accusing me of? It is a fucking trap if you give the guy shit advice that wont lead to anything but misery for all parties involved.",™

t5_2qh18,vidyesh,1325309407,"The concept of water cooling system is to bring down your CPU/component temps to your room temperature or 5C ish lower than room temperature.  So if you have a warm room don't blame the cooling system blame your room temp.  Corsair's Hydro series is a compact-closed-loop-liquid-cooling-system without the complexity of traditional water-cooling systems. That means they are designed in such a way that they should perform just like a mediocre water-cooling system. On the other hand Hyper 212 plus is an aftermarket CPU cooler, purely a heatsink with large blade fans giving the most(best) air cooling possible  (sans the noise).  So you should know what really to check.  Another major thing is these coolers perform different on different CPUs, as they perform in a different way.  [AMD Phenom™ II X3] (http://products.amd.com/pages/DesktopCPUDetail.aspx?id=522&amp;AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1) Max Temps : 73C  [AMD Phenom™ II X4] (http://products.amd.com/en-us/DesktopCPUDetail.aspx?id=532&amp;f1=AMD+Phenom%99+II+X4&amp;f2=&amp;f3=&amp;f4=512&amp;f5=&amp;f6=C2&amp;f7=45nm+SOI&amp;f8=&amp;f9=&amp;f10=False&amp;f11=) Max Temp : 62C  So the best way to know is by using both the coolers one-by-one on one CPU in the same room and comparing idle and load temps individually.  P.S. : After trying the first cooler give your system a 20mins cool off time before trying the second one.",™

t5_2snuc,ShamanSTK,1325324044,"&gt; The existence of God is unfalsifiable, which sounds good for God, but in the context of logic and science is A Bad Thing©. This is the same thing as using an all-powerful god as a premise; you always win, but the argument holds no weight. If there is no method of proving something wrong, how can you tell it's right? Faith.  Right, but unfalsifiable isn't necessarily a limitation. It just means you need to find the most internally consistent philosophy that, not only explains this world, but predicts it. This is specifically the part I take issue with.  &gt;  in the context of **logic** and science is A Bad Thing©.  Logic is not limited to falsifiable endeavors. In fact, that was the main contention between empiricism and logicism. If you're making scientific and falsifiable claims, you're doing religion wrong. But, there's nothing wrong with extending logics further than what is empirically verifiable, like spirituality, ethics, morality, and general philosophy. My problem with a religion being built on unconsidered premises is solely that they are unconsidered for their truth. Among Judaism's first formal answers to these types of demands, namely substantiating your premises, is Saadia Gaon's The Book of Beliefs and Opinions and Maimonides' Guide for the Perplexed. While they cite to scripture to show that the premises have always been substantiated, they build from scratch logical proofs for Judaism's premises. This is what started the Jewish Rationalism movement which would use contemporary science and logics to demonstrate basic theological truths. Judaism considers blind faith to be a poor basis of a religion, but rather, it is preferable to believe what you believe because you've seen it to be true.",©

He did not realize where it had come from, though the servants who had drawn the water knew. Then he called the bridegroom aside 10 and said, “Everyone brings out the choice wine first and then the cheaper wine after the guests have had too much to drink; but you have saved the best till now.”  11 This, the first of his miraculous signs, Jesus performed at Cana in Galilee. He thus revealed his glory, and his disciples put their faith in him.   There is NOTHING scriptural about NOT drinking. Jesus made it, and encouraged it. Paul TOLD people to drink.

t5_2rnve,way2funni,1325365114,"there is part of your problem. Did you read the system requirements?  550 Watt or greater power supply with one 150W **8-pin PCI Express**® power connector and one 75W 6-pin PCI Express® power connector recommended  Here is the AMD 6900 series approved PSU list:  http://support.amd.com/us/certified/power-supplies/Pages/listing.aspx   I took a look at your board and it does have integrated graphics.  Please refer to your user manual.   If you do not have your manual, you may download a copy from here:  ftp://174.142.97.10/manual/K10N78FullHD-hSLI%20R3.0.pdf  Please refer to page 45 which details how to gain access to the BIOS.  Then refer to page 53 which details Chipset options and how to change/set your Primary Graphics Adapter.   You would select PCI Express. Save and exit the BIOS.  If you were using the onboard graphics and did not previously correct this setting, you may now get some signs of life.  However if you try to fire up a game in 3D mode where the video chip now needs to draw it's full rated power requirement, the computer will probably shut down.  You may very well (almost certainly, in fact) blow out the PSU which in turn could blow out and damage other system components.  Govern yourself accordingly. Swap the PSU and that does't fix it, it's time to go under the hood into the BIOS as I mentioned and change over to PCI Express.  That should do it. Hope this helps.",®
