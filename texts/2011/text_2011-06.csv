t5_2qhnf,athanathios,1306933923,"Well I have 3 factors that are influencing me:  1) Strong desire to purify my mind. In my past, I have experienced various stages of insight, without a more formal meditation plan (although I know I was mediating in a different way than sitting). As I focused my energy (too wholeheartedly) in my career, some of my previous experiences got muddled with programs and attachments. So I have a desire, through first hand experience to purify my mind. So this motivation is important and keeps me on track and to see where my practice takes me.  2) Having only formally meditated for about 1.5 months so far, I can tell you that in and of itself, meditation has allowed me to (A) become more focused, (B) More mindful, © more at peace and calmer in general as well as other benefits. That's keeping me motivated.  3) Just keeping at it, consistency is key. I meditate at roughly the same time everyday, if I can't do it, I try to at least squeek in 10 minutes, this is usually a good way to keep on track.  Basically the more positive association you have with something, the more likely you will keep with it.

Now, suppose you have two very closely related parents:  Mom:     -----☹--------------     ------------☹-------  Dad:     -----☹--------------     ------------☹-------  Then, if they have children, the children will each get one of those lines (one set of chromosomes) from each parent.

t5_2qh2a,ezraekman,1306996378,"This is such bad business advice I don't even know where to begin.  Free = a watermarked image.  Period.  If they pay (I charge $10/image for low-res and $50/image for high-res), I'll remove the watermark.  I usually don't give away images at all unless it's strictly for personal use.  (i.e. Facebook profile photos, sending to friends/family, etc.)  And ""bands don't have any money"" is BS.  They have expensive gear.  They printed flyers.  They built a web site.  They paid for it all somehow.  Maybe they don't have three grand to hire three photographers and rent a bunch of custom lighting.  But they can afford $10/image.  Now, if you're BRAND SPANKING NEW on the scene, sure.  Give away a few photos.  Specify your terms carefully: no commercial use whatsoever except promotion on their web site and in social networks.  If they want more, they can pay a measly $10 per photo and drink a little less beer on their next gig.  Otherwise, give them 800x600 (or 900x600 for a more proportionally accurate un-cropped image).  I had a small band (one of two opening bands for the headliner) contact me just last week, wanting to license several of the photos I shot.  They can come up with $50-100 (or whatever) to license a few good quality photos of themselves playing live, because they know just how much of a benefit it is to be able to demonstrate how cool they look on stage, or what their stage presence is like, or what kind of performers they are, etc.  (i.e. how many fans/drinkers will they bring into a bar, hence making them a more attractive booking option for a venue's marketing or booking agent.)  So, yeah; they can come up with a few bucks to license a few photos.  It ain't a lot, ya know?  Yes, watermark your photos.  Copyright law is explicit: you must identify your work for your protection.  You can legally do this with metadata, but a watermark is harder to argue with; it's clear and obvious.  Include a (SMALL, i.e. 5-10% of the total image size, MAXIMUM) watermark in the photo in the lower left/right corner.  Make sure the watermark includes ""© Your Name"", and a link to your web site if you have one.  No, Flickr/Facebook is not a website.  YourName.SomeoneElsesCompany.com is not a website.  YourNamePhotography.com is a website.  Be professional, and make sure it's easy for people to find/contact you.  For what it's worth, I shoot 1-5 events per week, and I've never gotten a single referral from a photo credit.  Generally, it's either word of mouth, or more often, handing someone a business card at an event I'm shooting for someone else.  So get some business cards ASAP.  [Vistaprint](http://www.vistaprint.com/) gives away 250 cheap cards, though you can also order 5,000 full-color, double-sided professional business cards for under $100 from [OvernightPrints.com](http://www.overnightprints.com/).  After you have a solid design you're happy with, I'd recommend doing that, then hand them out like crazy.  If you're thinking twice about handing out a business card to someone (unless they give you a bad vibe or something), you don't have enough business cards.  Re: RAW files, **never, ever, EVER give away your RAW files to ANYONE, EVER!**  They are your data, not the finished image.  High-res JPEG or TIFF files, fine.  But whoever has the RAW file can claim ownership of the image.  Also, most people simply don't have the knowledge or the right software to open RAW files.  Everyone can open a JPEG.  Give away watermarked low-res JPGs (optimized for decent quality and small file size, as they'll be used on the web), sell them high-res JPGs (or give them away, if you're so inclined), and keep your RAW files.  The only exception I will ever make to this rule is if they pay a *serious premium* for the files, or if it's ""work for hire"" through an employer... but I've been shooting for 10 years, all while gainfully employed, and have never had to give up the RAW files, or even the copyright, since I specified ahead of time that I owned my own images.  (Note: make sure you do this as well - if you don't, and you're shooting on company time or using company property, as an employee, your work belongs to them unless you agree otherwise in writing!)  Also, if your pick is 30 photos, don't give them 30 photos.  Give them 10-15 if the ""best of the best"", so to speak.  Then you've got 1-2 times as many photos to give them as well, if they want to see more.  As you shoot more events, you'll discover that you're taking more photos, and will have a larger pool to draw from.  When my clients hire me to shoot, I'll generally shoot 1-3K shots in a 2-3 hour event, and end up with 60-150 final photos after 3-4 rounds of cuts.  (1st round cuts anything with obvious flaws: focus/blur, exposure issues, distracting FG/BG objects, etc.  2nd round cuts anything boring.  3rd round cuts anything not awesome/exciting/happy/etc.  4th round cuts the shots I'm the least excited about if I'm still having trouble bringing the numbers down.)

The Penidab© was invented by me and test marketed in Beruit in 1975 but. . .well. . .we thought the Paris of the Middle East was pretty stable at the time, and. . .  Anyway, the Penidab© looks very similar to those circle cotton rounds that women use to dab off makeup. In no way do we write with a marker Penidab© on the cotton rounds that we buy at Target (say Tarjae). You put a couple of the Penidabs© in your pocket and after you shake a few times just slap that puppy on your penis and soak up the extra drips and toss the Penidab© in the toilet.  Our other product is the BabyRoo© and MiniRoo© which are little clear plastic saddles, with a weight on one side and a clear pocket to slip an ipad in (or in the MiniRoo© case an ipod touch).  You slip your ipad into the BabyRoo© put on some Baby Einstein and drop that saddle over the edge of the crib or pack and play and BAM forget a mobile (say Alabama) now your kid can have hours of enjoyment whilst you mouth breathe on reddit all day!!

Unfortunately, it might take a *lot* of time, so you have to prepare yourself for that. Four years is a long time, it might take you many months (or even years) to get over it entirely.  By all means, sit at home and cry and drink and get it out of your system: you're more than entitled to do that. When you're done, get ready to put yourself to work. When my long-term relationship ended, what helped me most was staying active. I'm not the partying/clubbing/bar-hopping type, and I live pretty far away from friends, so I couldn't hang out, but I kept busy. I repainted my bedroom, got a new job (I'll admit that it was a coincidence, but it helped), took up new hobbies and so forth, and focusing on all of that meant I didn't have time to feel down about that loser (because his loss, seriously. I'm awesome) because I was too distracted or focused on the other things. All that helped me get over some long-term depression and low self-esteem, too.

t5_2qh68,thedarkerside,1307345209,"&gt; I thought he performed better than anyone at the CBC Leaders debates. Layton and Ignatieff sounded whiny at best, and mostly just repeated a bunch of irrelevant points (OMG, FIGHTER JETS INSTEAD OF HEALTHCARE, irrelevant and untrue bullshit like that). Then Ignatieff accidentally a Chairman Mao quote to round it all out.  Funny how perception goes. My impression was that Iggy was agitated, mainly over the Haper's behavioure in the HoC. The problem was he didn't connect that with the audience, which didn't surprise me.  Layton came off as.... well, Layton. He got a few good shots in.  &gt; Harper was unscripted, reasonable, calm and mature. He didn't need to resort to catchphrases and appeals to emotion because he actually had talking points.  Harper? Did not answer one question, sidestepped, ignored or just plain said nothing with a lot of words. His body language and the way he looked in the camera came off as if he was on drugs, following a script. Could have been a Robot.  &gt; Layton just tumbles into stupid, one sentence after another. His policies are ludicrous and unbalanced with regard to both budget and benefit, and are only intended to attract votes from the voter demographic that feels marginalized in modern society.  Dunno. Having read both the Conservative and the NDP program the NDP one makes more sense for me. Less holding onto old ways an more money for new ways. The spending priorities are clearly different than what the CPC wants to do, but based on the numbers presented (and based on what I saw out of Kevin Page's office) the NDP numbers struck me as more realistic.  &gt; Harper proposes balanced budgets,   With numbers that don't add up. Not even by his own account. Their proposed budget didn't add up.   Oh, and I would also like to remind you that presenting a budget is one thing, a completely different thing to delivery it. I would just like to remind you that Harper said there will be no deficit in the budget and then delivered a whopping 50+ billion in deficit spending.  &gt; keeps the social opinions he has that I disagree with (anti-gay, anti-abortion) out of the Parliament,  Actually he said that the **Government** wouldn't reopen these. This does not mean that he can't have his back benchers put forward a bill.  &gt; and will hopefully be able to push through an economic agenda that I agree with now that he has a majority.  I am curious. I don't think his agenda makes any sense at all. instead it strikes me as driven by an ideology that has already proven a failure. And I say that as someone who runs his own business. What about his economic agenda appeals to you specifically?  &gt; I haven't been remarkably happy with many of the concessions he has made to the Opposition parties thus far, so I'm hoping that with them out of the picture, we'll get electoral reform, Senate reform, and a more balanced budget.  He has not touched electoral or senate reform during his five years of minority Government, why would he now?  As for the budget? Unlikely it will be restrained or balanced, the cost of his ""tough on crime™"" agenda as well as his little foray into the F-35 will make sure of that.",™

From the press release:  &gt; Pricing &amp; Availability Mac OS X Lion will be available in July as an upgrade to Mac OS X version 10.6 Snow Leopard® from the Mac App Store for $29.99 (US). Lion will be the easiest OS X upgrade and at about 4GB, it is the size of an HD movie from the iTunes Store®.  &gt; [...]  &gt; Lion requires an Intel-based Mac with a Core 2 Duo, i3, i5, i7 or Xeon processor and 2GB of RAM.

If I can recall correctly, the comment about reboots was in a list of other things that are a problem with optical media OS upgrades. Then, Phil Schiller (?) says ""No more"" as in ""No more optical media.""  I can't even install Snow Leopard point updates without rebooting. I sincerely doubt Lion can be installed on top of Snow Leopard without a reboot.  If it is true that Lion can install without a reboot, I will have to see and hear someone say it in the Keynote with my own eyes and ears.  **Edit**:  I just watched the keynote on apple.com, and Phil Schiller says ""Installs right in place; you don't need to reboot *from an optical disk*.""

t5_2rnve,lurker818,1307393113,"You seem to not understand so I will try to put it a different way.       Why would you build a system with sub-par parts when you can buy the same system off-lease for about half the price of putting it together yourself. Please remember we are not talking about using salvaged or used parts. You are actually telling people to go buy brand new obsolete crap.   If someone asked for suggestions for a cheep computer to play sc2 on I would not advise them to build one. I would tell them to either get a good computer that is used or set your sites higher.            Think of it this way. What is the MINIMUM you expect to be able to purchase a case, motherboard, ps, ram, HDD, and cpu for?      Well, at tigerdirect.ca (for example) the cheapest of each is:      * CASE: Apex PC-389 ATX Black Mid Tower Case @ $34.99 * MOBO: 	MSI K9N6PGM2-V2 Motherboard - NVIDIA® @ $45.99 * PS: DiabloTek PSDA250 250-Watt Power Supply - ATX @ $12.99 * RAM: Kingston 1024MB PC5300 DDR2 667MHz Memory @$17.97 * HDD: Seagate ST3500413AS Barracuda Hard Drive - 500GB @ $39.97 * CPU: AMD Athlon X2 7850 Black Edition Dual Core Processor AD785ZWCJ2BGH @ $49.97      So if you were to purchase this computer from Tigerdirect it would cost you $201.88 and you would have the absolute worst computer that can be made using the parts available at Tigerdirect.ca       Now, for an extra $35 you can buy this bare-bones system:  ZOTAC GF6100-E-E nForce 4 Barebones Kit - ZOTAC GF6100-E-E Mini ITX Board, AMD Athlon X2 7850 BE CPU, CPU Cooler, Patriot 4GB (2x 2GB) DDR2 RAM, Seagate 500GB HDD, DVDRW, Diablotek Mid Tower, 400W PSU      You may notice things like twice the RAM, extra 150 watts on the PS and a DVD-RW drive.       Conclusion: It's cheaper to get the bare minimum system but its way better to get a kit as it is only marginally more expensive but some of the parts are way better.       $400 is not a cheap SC2 build, it's mid-range. If you are incapable of understanding the OP's request then you are not the type of person to be giving out advice. ",®

Speaking at the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Technology Conference, Sanjay Jha, who heads up Motorola Mobility, said that the lack of quality control in the Android Marketplace was behind the high number of handset returns – along with the multitasking nature of Android, which permits background apps to eat into the battery and processor time.  ""Anyone can put an application on the Android Marketplace ... without any testing process,"" Jha told delegates, explaining that the ability to multitask is a blessing and a curse. ""Seventy per cent of devices are coming back because they have downloaded a third-party application, and the effect that has on performance.""  During the presentation, which was staged as an interview and is available on the conference site, Jha also spoke extensively about Motoblur. Motoblur is often seen as a simple UI skin for Android, but is really about customer ownership and identity aggregation.  Motorola would like its users to consider themselves customers of Motorola, rather than customers of their mobile network operator, or Google, and so it is pleased to have 10 million subscribers signed in with Motoblur, and has plans to increase that number significantly.  As well as hooking customers, Jha talks about Motoblur being able to help manage third-party apps by warning the user when something is consuming excessive power or processor cycles, but the company told Fierce Wireless that its current approach was based on better developer support though its Motodev programme. ®  Agile Project Management tool.

t5_6,alk509,1307434552,"&gt; I think supporting large corporations is absolutely horrid.  \- Sent from my Apple™ MacBook.  &gt; Do you really want me to break down micro/macros economics on a worldwide scale for you?  By all means, do.  &gt; It leads to less jobs  This is self-evidently not true. The franchise operator in your example has about ten times as many employees than Mom and Pop across the street. A single Walmart store employs more people than the three stores it drove out of business. And, again, this all assumes corporate franchises are a net-negative for local businesses, which is not always the case: A few years ago, a Walmart opened in my town, along with a few fast food national chain restaurants. Some existing nearby shops went out of business within a year, but the increased volume of shoppers attracted more businesses, which lead to more people, which lead to even more businesses opening. Today that whole road and the area around it is a vibrant retail shopping district that employs hundreds. It spills over into a neighboring low-income town, and provides employment opportunities for them, as well.   &gt; outsourcing  In retail? I can't remember the last time I bought a McDonald's meal from ""Patrick"" in Kuala Lumpur...  &gt; lower quality  Highly dependent on the particular business. McDonald's or Taco Bell? Sure. Five Guys or Chipotle? Not so much.  &gt; less security  Not sure what you mean by that. Like, personal security? Job security? Something else?  &gt; and a one direction money flow. I'll let you guess which way that flow is...  So the profits from Mom and Pop's operation pay for their two employees and go into their personal bank account, while the profits from a corporation go to their several-orders-of-magnitude-larger workforce and tens of thousands of shareholders. And in your mind, the latter is more of a wealth sink than the former. Come on, now...  &gt; I'm not even implying, I'm stating as fact that yes, running several chain restaurants is not as difficult as running one full time.  That's the kind of bold claim that can only come from a profound ignorance of the subject at hand. Have you ever even worked at a chain restaurant, let alone run one or several of them? You show me the kind of hands-off restaurant owner you're talking about, that sits back and runs five places from his cell phone, and I'll show you five restaurants that will be closing by the end of the week.  &gt; Shift manager &lt; store manager &lt; district manager &lt; regional manager &lt; corporate. The amount of work is inversely related, as is the amount of pay.  About ten years ago, I was assistant manager at a chain restaurant for a year, working under the owner/restaurant manager. Believe me when I tell you you're full of shit. The work of running a restaurant is hard whether you're Mom and Pop, or a franchise operator - and it doesn't magically get easier if you have to run not one, but multiple locations. Also, Mom and Pop are ultimately their own bosses and have a degree of freedom about how they do business that franchise operators don't have. This claim that Mom and Pop are somehow working harder than a franchise is bunk.  &gt; There it is. Capitalism at its finest. As long as its cheap, we can ignore the consequences.  No: the consequences, such as they may be, are built into the price. It just so happens that not everybody is wealthy enough to afford the kind of charity patronage you seem to favor.  &gt; Need some community facts to go along with it? Here's a place to start: [1] Study proves it: Walmart super-stores kill off local small businesses.  Great: [I know about Google, too](http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/2529468/posts).  &gt; Shall we continue?  Meh, I think we have some fundamental disagreements about the relative subjective worth of one's own wealth versus the wealth of others, the value of locally-owned, poorly-run businesses, and the virtues of free market capitalism. I don't think we're going to convince each other of much...",™

I am simply interested in what lies before us.  &gt;I would enjoy a conversation on how convincing these studies are or their specific methodological flaws, but my point stands: the bulk of the empirical evidence provides no support for the hypothesis that trade/openness leads to lower growth and in fact supports the hypothesis that it raises national income and lifts people out of poverty.  I generally agree with this.  I think that low trade barriers have been a net blessing for poor countries (sweatshops and the like necessitating the need for the qualifier ""net"").

t5_2qob4,isosafrole,1307581330,"It is certainly provocative. This is why I added “(Alternet)” to the post title, as Alternet isn't exactly known for holding its punches. I felt that as clonazepam is becoming such a controversial drug—and I have to say that I agree with some of the concerns about the ubiquity of benzodiazepine prescribing in the USA—it was worth posting. After all, some patients will be reading the article and may turn up in a clinic extremely worried.  It's odd. In the USA, the prescribing rate of benzodiazepines and opioids is extremely high. In the UK, people who are deserving of benzodiazepines or opioid treatment—and who would benefit greatly—have great trouble in obtaining prescriptions. Though benzodiazepines have a great addiction/tolerance potential, they also have a surprisingly high therapeutic index. Some people can take the same dose for many months, or even years, without any obvious tolerance, though dependence is common. The question is; if they are benefiting from the drug, showing no signs of increasing the dose or asking for excessive repeat prescriptions, but could be said to be dependent, is the prescription inappropriate?  We have patients who have been on a stable dose of benzodiazepine for years being switched to second-generation neuroleptics such as quetiapine (Seroquel®) and risperidone (Risperdal®)—drugs with a far more damaging adverse effect profile, and then remaining on them for years, because the UK authorities imply that almost *any* prescribing of benzodiazepines is inappropriate.",®

(The difference is about $250 Billion, and an invaluable amount of ""good will"" of which America was sucked-dry by the Bush Administration).  But I agree with you... Obama painted a simple picture for us simple folk.  And simply, Obama has not been able to deliver to the degree that he (essentially) promised -- certainly not at the pace we all hoped.    But there is a huge difference between the current Administration (and the last) - don't believe the hype:  Most of the people echoing the ""Obama is the same as Bush"" are people like Karl Rove (who want you to believe - so badly - that the Bush Administration wasn't really all that bad).  **IN TRUTH, there is a enormous difference between the Obama Administration (and the Bush Administration).**  Yes, change is occurring slower than Obama promised.

t5_2rfxx,nevercore,1307641491,"Anyone who played DotA probably doesn't have much of an issue with LoL only having two maps. The issue of new maps became a big deal because Riot's PR department used to be god awful and they would constantly release information of features which were exciting and going to be implemented Soon™.  The biggest snafu was when Riot released information about a new 4 v 4 map named Magma Chamber. They showed concept art and the community got pretty excited about it, then nothing else was said about it for a long time. The same thing with the graphics engine overhaul, aka Project Shiny.   As for the rest of the community, those for whom LoL is their first moba, they are probably just used to other multiplayer games. LoL is the first moba I've ever player, and even though there are two maps, I only play SR. I wouldn't mind seeing another map, but I'm not whining about a new one. I do think however, that LoL has become more popular than DotA and as such will prompt other companies to make mobas.

t5_2qnmr,jeannaimard,1307652940,"Here’s the full text, in full violation of the Gazoo’s holy ©:  Those who garden would understand why Frank Teuton of Pointe Claire spends as much time planting and weeding as he does composting. The claybound soil covering much of Montreal Island, the West Island included, needs help.  But the avid Pointe Claire composter has run afoul of local municipal authorities for setting up an oversized composter in his driveway, another nine standard-sized black plastic composters along the side of his house and for leaving out the tools he uses to aerate, screen and add worms to the compost.  The city's public security department slapped Teuton with four tickets for violating local bylaws that set property standards for, among other things, cleanliness, weed control and garbage. The tickets, $100 each, came in pairs, one set in July of last year and the second, last October.  But Teuton, a widowed father of three who teaches chess in local schools, has refused to pay the tickets on principle. The case is scheduled to be heard June 2 in municipal court in Pointe Claire.  ""It's a right-to-garden and a rightto-compost issue,"" Teuton said Wednesday, as he led an impromptu tour through his property, a 6,000-squarefoot lot on Ivanhoe Crescent.  ""I think we need about 200 more people like me in Pointe Claire,"" he added.  An individual two-by-two-foot black plastic composter, like the ones available from Pointe Claire's public works department for about $25, Teuton complained, holds only about 11 cubic feet, hardly enough to make a difference to the garden.  ""I will not comment on a case before the courts,"" said Morris Trudeau, the Pointe Claire city councillor whose name is written down as the complainant on the tickets issued to Teuton.  Like other West Island municipalities, the city of Pointe Claire operates a composting program whereby leaves, grass clippings and kitchen waste are collected at the curb once a week, spring through fall, turned into compost at a facility in St. Michel and, then, made available to local residents the following spring.  However, Teuton said, he needs larger quantities of compost for the various berry patches, vegetable and flower gardens on his property. Plus, he added, he disagrees with the idea of trucking green waste across the city in order to make compost.  Some of his neighbours, including Nathalie Pesod bring their kitchen scarps to him.  ""It doesn't bother me at all,"" said another neighbour, Margo Edwards. ""Whatever we take out of the earth, I think we should put back in,"" she said.  Teuton admits his compost operation can be messy at times, especially when he uses his double driveway as a ""work surface,"" laying out leaves and grass clippings to dry or to be shredded with the lawn mower before he puts them into compost. He does the same with used coffee grinds collected from local restaurants. ""They contain five-per-cent nitrogen and are great for compost,"" he said.  But Teuton said he doesn't deserve to be ticketed. He has made efforts to be both green and clean. He has moved into his backyard, the four-byfour foot composter that was on his driveway when he was ticketed last fall and, he said, he is trying harder to put away his tools once he is done using them.  ccornacchia@montrealgazette.com  © Copyright (c) The Montreal Gazette   Read more: http://www.montrealgazette.com/Composter+refuses+city+fines/4807201/story.html#ixzz1OoYZg4WM",©

t5_6,edgy14u,1307769778,"For the Real Estate Professionals out there – left standing – I ask the title question again…, but instead of insisting on an answer I am going to reveal to you a SOLUTION to YOUR biggest problem – and that is how to turn this mortgage foreclosure crisis around to your benefit, help people STAY-IN-THEIR-HOMES, and alas, make MONEY the whole time you’re doing all this SAVE-THE -PLANET/HOMEOWNER STUFF! Got it?   The Real Estate market has always been an excellent wealth-producing arena for the savvy R/E businessperson, and it can be that again – RIGHT NOW! How is that going to be accomplished? Answer: By solving American homeowners largest problem (not the problems of no jobs, higher taxes, or record government spending)  Ok…, maybe those are the country’s biggest problems, but Negative Equity is the American HOMEOWNERS largest problem! So the SOLUTION to the American Homeowners problems means the SOLUTION to your biggest problem (and visa-versa!)   Let’s first discuss what you’re doing to the American homeowner to alleviate their problems and for you to make money in today’s depressing R/E workplace. Let’s start with Short Sales. Ugh! Though Short Sales should be handled by professionals, they are only a bad option given any financially strapped homeowner. A means to an end. I hate them. The only people who love them are the ones doing a lot of them, making money off the misery of others misfortunes. They are distasteful, but what other options are there?  Cash-for-keys. Ugh, again! The person is out of their home with money provided by the lender to rent somewhere and for the (former) homeowner to ‘walk away’! Deed-in-lieu. A ‘Nice Try’ Ugh! Lenders hate deed-in-lieu’s because they CAN’T COME AFTER THE HOMEOWNER FOR THE DIFFERENCE! Think about this: If a lender is willing to do a Short Sale, why wouldn’t they just consider a deed-in-lieu? Answer: The lender can’t collect from a correctly agreed D-I-L and…, the R/E agent won’t make any money! In a Short Sale, lenders WILL come after you EVEN when it is writing they won’t – because the Servicing Agent that loan is sold to CAN (and WILL) come after the homeowner! Got the TRUE difference? Ouch! Double Ouch, and Ugh!- double Ugh! Need I go through the Loan Mods (which are a DISMAL failure), the FHA restrictive Underwater refinancing? C’mon! What an example of how screwed up government is…   Not only am I depressing myself at this point, this is just half-way through! So please, bear with me, because all of this has a silver-lined cloud ending, I GUARANTEE YOU!   But first…, let’s grovel further into the muck… Why Housing Is Going Through a Double Dip This is an article that tells you not only the WHY, but also gives a hint of HOW long for… Loan Modification Failure Rate is High This article just flat out tells you that the lenders that are (supposedly) granting loan mods – are granting them at their discretion, – which means not at all! What a shock, huh? Wait! There’s more…!  Government Loan Modification Programs a Failure So Far Here’s an article that sends even the most ardent R/E professional to the help wanted ads!: The Housing Market Could Take Years to Correct verified by this gem: 6 Reasons Housing Isn’t Coming Back Soon Ouch, double-fudge-covered, triple UGH!   But the best one is yet to come, DON”T MISS THIS ONE! Just imagine a couple who has invested cash to purchase a foreclosure (you gotta have cash!) and then an additional (let’s say) $30,000 to bring the foreclosed and dilapidated house up to code and to the new owner’s comfort level. It’s six months later, they’re both sitting in their ultra-comfortable, and expensive Home-Theatre seating, and they get a knock at the door…, Read: Foreclosure and the Durrett Rule Ok…, enough with the childlike euphemisms describing ugly! That is just god-awful!   What would have to exist to turn this horrendous, negative equity situation around for homeowners?   If only…,  say…, some kinda FUND existed that would purchase NEGATIVE EQUITY homes, ones that are, say…, 120 LTV, and above, allow even people who are late on payments to negative equity refinance, or Principally Reduce their mortgage balances to CURRENT MARKET VALUE! Yeah! Then issue the new mortgages as 30-year fixed, at (let’s say again) at prime plus 3%…, yeah! Prime Plus 3%, with NO deficiency judgment! YEAH! That’s IMPORTANT! NO DEFICIENCY JUDGMENT!   Where would such a thing exist? And How could such a thing exist?  (Could I rub a lamp, or something?)   Allow me to be your Genie-for-a-day: You’re Not Selling Homes, So How Are You Making Money?   I hope you experience an epiphany…   copyright© 2011 by Edward Gee ",©

t5_2qh2p,BadHat,1307815915,"This is exactly my objection whenever an apologist starts talking about ""objective"" morality, thanks for articulating it.  Actually, you can get even deeper than the different denominations of Christianity and talk about how people's individual moral compasses influence how they interpret scriptural teachings on morality.  It's tempting to think it happens the other way around, but in interactions with more reasonable Christians I've found they like to point out how similar their morals are to secular values - they just arrived at them via another method.  William Lane Craig brings this up a lot in debates, and he's a big proponent of objective morality.  Actually, it's one of his five big arguments for God that he rolls out at just about every opportunity - the last of which is his own experience of the holy spirit.  Yeah, his personal experience of God is an objective proof according to him.  He's actually been quoted as saying that, should a conflict arise between his experiential 'knowledge' of God and evidence to the contrary, he would always side with God... and then he waffles on about objectivity as though he's anything like an impartial source.  Of course, this just speaks to the problem with these kind of claims - even if there *were* an objective source of morality (God, obviously~), his perfect and immutable word™ would still be filtered through minds that think in subjective terms.

t5_2qh2p,dooflotchie,1307831442,"&gt;When you turn 18 there's always the military  This is a fine idea for many reasons:  -Your parents can't do jack shit to stop you from enlisting the very minute you turn 18.  -In this shitty job market, you'll have a much better chance of getting employment this way.  -You've got 4 years minimum of job security as long as you don't fuck up really badly (like commit certain crimes, for one) and get yourself kicked out of the service.  -You will be taught a skill of some sort and you'll be taught to do it well. (Here's where I had to ask my Navy veteran husband about how that worked for him, he told me when you sign up you can specify certain fields you'd like to work in or you can choose to be ""undesignated"" if you're not sure about what you want to do.) That will work differently in different branches of the service, so check them all out thoroughly. Talk to any veterans you know who have been in the military in the last few years, plus I am sure there are subreddits for discussions about it too. ➡**HUGELY IMPORTANT THING: If any recruiter you talk to promises you something you want, GET IT IN WRITING!** The ""Cover Your Ass"" principle is something you must remember.  -You get great benefits in the service. Health insurance. Housing assistance. The GI bill. A VA loan if you want to buy a house. Preferential hiring benefits in civilian jobs, such as the Postal service, police and fire departments and a lot of private companies too. For example, my husband started working for PetSmart 6 months after I did but he started out making more than me because he is a veteran. Even though he is not a manager he makes almost as much as they do because of their policy of paying veterans more.

t5_2qm4e,inquilinekea,1307913924,"It's hard to definitively say at this moment. The early sun was much dimmer than it is now, which means that Mars had to have HUGE amounts of CO2 to obtain a greenhouse effect significant enough to offset its increased distance from the Sun - but this would be hard for a planet whose mass was so small. Early on, it may also have retained some energy from accretional and radioactive processes (at had a magma ocean for the first billion years of its life). But accretional/radioactive heat would be more evenly distributed throughout the Martian atmosphere, rather than localized to equatorial regions (much like solar heat is)  In any case, here's one good paper:* Forget F, Pierrehumbert RT. 1997. Warming early Mars with carbon dioxide clouds that scatter infrared radiation. Science 278: 1273–76 [CrossRef] [Web of Science ®] [ADS]*  Here's another good quote I got from a paper (http://www.annualreviews.org/eprint/i86y2DeTuaEFxeFyIJXu/full/10.1146/annurev-earth-040809-152447):  &gt;As noted by Walker (2001), the seasonal cycle is rather like that of Mars, which also has a global solid surface. The Martian analog is strengthened by the fact that the solar radiation absorbed by the high-albedo Snowball Earth, per unit surface area, is comparable to the solar radiation that the non-Snowball Mars absorbs in its more distant orbit. The Neoproterozoic solar forcing of the Snowball is 128 W m−2 if the albedo is 60%, or 96 W m−2 if the albedo is 70%; this compares with 110 W m−2 for present Mars or approximately 77 W m−2 for the Mars of 4 billion years ago. Furthermore, at the low temperatures of Snowball Earth and Mars, the water vapor content of the atmosphere is so low that neither the water vapor greenhouse effect nor the latent heat of water vapor condensation has any significant influence on the climate. The Snowball climate differs from present Mars, however, in that Earth's atmosphere is thicker, providing enough thermal inertia to damp the diurnal cycle significantly; in this regard, Snowball Earth is more like an early Mars with a dense atmosphere. A further difference is that Earth is a larger planet. Given the same rotation rate, this means that Earth's Hadley cell is more confined to the tropics, whereas that of Mars has a more global character—all other things being equal, a larger planet acts dynamically like a more rapidly rotating planet of lesser diameter (Caballero et al. 2008). &gt;  If you want some more good papers...  http://www3.geosc.psu.edu/~jfk4/PersonalPage/PDFs.htm  http://faculty.washington.edu/dcatling/publications.html",®
t5_2qh2p,tina_ri,1307915540,"Linear Relations and Functions  What does this picture remind you of? A piece of Corn Chex^® cereal? A fly swatter lying against a mirror? A net or snare? Actually, this orange maze is a graph of sorts. This chapter emphasizes graphs. As you will learn, a graph is a picture of an equation. You will begin with equations that describe straight lines rather than the complex shapes that you see here.  Graphs and linear functions are useful tools for describing relationships or concepts. For example, a linear function such as *y* = 0.25*x* can describe the number of people (*y*) who will accept Christ after *x* hours of witnessing. According to the relationship represented by this function, a person will see only one soul saved for every four hours he spends sharing the gospel. He cannot expect more. (In practice, though not in this function, he might actually see fewer saved.)  As a Christian, you know that it was God who worked in your heart and brought you to a saving knowledge of Him. Your salvation was not based on a ""linear relationship"" in which you did something for God and He in turn did something for you. You gave nothing, but he gave everything. This same principle applies to your service. What is accomplished in the lives of others is not a result of your witness, but of God's working. God goes beyond what anyone can do and does ""exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think"" (Eph. 3:20).",®

t5_2qh03,ViennettaLurker,1308011331,"&gt; But most of you guys are like, na, lets protest until release then buy the game because there is nothing else to do.  ...what? Who? Who said that?  &gt; IF nobody bought it, the company will go down. Plus, it enforces companies to change their business model, start doing ethical actions.  You have to tell them *why* you aren't buying it. Lets say that people who have a problem with this specific issue simply ""Just don't buy it!™"", who's to say why they aren't buying it?  ""Sir! They aren't buying the new Battlefield!"" ""Shit! Lets jam in more exclusive pre-order, retailer-specific content. People seemed to like it last time.""  Yes, they're just a company. Yes they just want to make money. I wouldn't be upset if it was early access, extra skins, or even extra maps (maybe that one a little). But if me and 50,000 other people all say we'd like them to change something (that wouldn't be that hard to change), you're talking about $300,000 in lost sales. And why would we do that? Lets break down the announcement:  1) Exclusive. Not ""early access"". Exclusive. If they're planning on releasing it later for everyone, they haven't said it yet.  2) Weapons. The things that make an FPSes...um, S. This is a play balance issue. If there are guns that I have to buy within a certain time frame- what are these guns? If they are at all different, in anyway from the ""normal"" guns... that fucks up play balance. Well, unless they're absolutely shit guns. In which case, I wouldn't care.  But if there is an exclusive weapon that has *any* kind of advantage over the others, and that weapon needs to be bought- that is fucked up. Imagine Street Fighter 5, where you had to pre-order the game in order to have Ryu's Hadoken move. And if you didn't, when you went online to fight people would hose you down with Hadokens and you couldn't do the same because you didn't pre-order the game.  It breaks the competitive balance of the game. Period. If they want to explain how it *won't*, I'm all ears.",™

t5_2qh6i,karper,1308036812,"(Here we go again!) I'm jobless, so I'll bite.  Welocome to kde, btw. I came for apps and stayed for everything else. Let's start with the apps. Let me try and pick the best apps in their class (I tend to lean towards power user apps — I want both features and configurability):  * file manager (konqueror\*) * music player (amarok\*) * cd burning (k3b) * browser (firefox) * im client (kopete/gaim) * games (kdegames) * pim suite (kontact/evolution) * text editor (kate) * media player (mplayer) * terminal (yakuake)  This is basically how things used to be when I discovered kde. Much has changed since then. New apps like chromium came around that didn't even exist back then. I've also starred a couple of applications that don't exist in their old form anymore. I basically found that I was using so many k-apps that I was curious what the heck kde was. The switch I made subsequently was like a breath of fresh air.  Today, if you had to make the switch, I'd imagine your list would include plasma (the ridiculously configurable, changeable workspace), oxygen (icons and widgets responsible for the kde look), kwin (easily the most feature rich and configurable window manager in existence) and other 4.x stuff.  You may also like how all the apps fit together like they were all made by the same team. Each app is configured the same (Settings &gt; Configure app...). You might even really like how one app can be a part of another app — for instance, if you're using the file manager and want a terminal quick, just open the terminal pane (f4). Or how you basically just need to configure the terminal once and everywhere you see a terminal (konsole, yakuake, dolphin, konqueror, kdevelop, etc.) it's the exact same terminal. Similarly, the text editor in kate, kwrite, etc. is the exact same text editor everywhere.  You might also like how network protocols are slickly abstracted away. Use fish:/ or smb:/ or ftp:/ to browse remote shares in your file manager or from any kde application as if they're local folders. It's a pity audio CDs have started becoming ancient, but I dare you not to be impressed when you pop one in and go to audiocd:/ Now, we have an abstraction called timeline:/ that lets you browse your files by the date it was created/modified. You can use all these so-called kioslaves in any kde application, including plasma. So, you can do cool things like have folder view widgets pointing to files you've been working on today, or even more elegantly filtered results.  Finally, you might switch because you're excited by where the project is headed. Plasma is once again awesome in this regard, but you'll probably not see its many forms if you don't own many classes of devices. Try it on a desktop and a netbook for starters.  One of our newest technologies (called akonadi) completely decouples the data from our pim suite applications. Our email client no longer owns our email. Our contacts app no longer owns our contacts. Our calender app no longer owns our calendar. This means we could soon use *any* email app and be working on the same emails. Instant sync, if you like. Your data is now free of the application.  Soon, the IM client (kopete) will be redundant. We'll have IM built transparently into our desktop. You tell kde you have these accounts and then you can see your contacts list from any IM application or widget or what-have-you. This is technically a freedesktop thing, so it's not just kde that's going there. But, I'm excited about it anyway. :)  Finally, this might not be a big deal to you, but the dev community tends to do the right thing™ when making decisions about the projects interoperability with other projects. kde often makes wide allowances for playing nice with other de's and wm's. Virtually no other project even takes the time to care how well their programs play well with other platforms. I also like how kde dreams big and still is humble enough to listen to downstream concerns.  Well, so that's it. Came for the apps, stayed for everything else. :) If you have any specific questions later on, pop by and ask! ",™

In a revelation that is stirring anger on Capitol Hill and among Iraqi officials in Baghdad, the office that was created by the Bush administration to monitor efforts to get Iraq on its feet after the 2003 invasion is saying that $6.6bn (€4.6bn) all delivered in cash, cannot be accounted for.  Just how much of the missing money was pocketed either by US contractors or Iraqis is not clear, nor is it likely that a full picture of what happened will ever be painted. Even so, Stuart Bowen, who runs the monitoring office, said that the errant billions may represent the ""largest theft of funds in national history"".  Controls  What does seem clear is that, in its rush to get cash into Iraq to help persuade the population that economic and social order could be re-established quickly, the US did not ensure the proper level of financial controls. The US was sending C-130 Hercules transport planes loaded with $100 bills.  The money was mostly drawn from Iraqi oil revenues and the UN Oil-for-Food fund. Consequently, the Iraqi government may demand that Washington compensate the country for the missing money.  ""Iraq has an interest in looking after its assets,"" said Samir Sumaidaie, Iraq's ambassador to the US. That will not be well received by the US Congress, however, which has seen more than $60bn spent on Iraqi reconstruction. ""Congress is not looking forward to having to spend billions of our money to make up for billions of their money that we can't account for,"" noted Congressman Henry Waxman.

But in the real world, people just don't drink responsibly, in Madison or anywhere else. And the traffic layout in the Dudgeon-Monroe neighborhood is NOT accommodating for careless drivers. Monroe, which allows side parking, is basically a very narrow two-lane street, with several blind corners. If there are already accidents on the four-lane and six-lane straightaways downtown (and there are), what will happen here?  And on football days... I don't even want to think about it. The neighborhood is already near-unbearable on game days, without fans having a more convenient place to get hammered within slow-walking distance of the stadium.",™

t5_2qm06,arsenic_lifeform_4u,1308204199," Suman 30 muertos por ola violenta en NL Por EL NORTE / Staff Monterrey,  México (15 junio 2011).-   La escalada de violencia en el Estado superó hoy el récord del año al registrarse 30 muertes relacionadas con el crimen organizado en un día.  En distintos hechos delictivos, autoridades reportaron 14 muertes en Monterrey, 6 en Guadalupe, 5 en Pesquería, 3 en Cadereyta, 1 en Santa Catarina y otra en San Pedro.  El pasado 20 de mayo Nuevo León tuvo su jornada más violenta al sumar 18 muertos también, 14 de ellos reportados fallecidos en un incendio en el Cereso de Apodaca y otros 4 en ejecuciones ligadas a la delincuencia organizada.  Hoy, en el hecho más reciente, al menos 7 muertos se registraron en un lapso de 20 minutos en calles de la Colonia Moderna.  Los cuerpos de auxilio recibieron el reporte de personas sin vida y heridas a las 22:00 horas.  Los socorristas encontraron a un hombre ejecutado, a un lado de un auto Jetta Blanco, en el cruce de Peral e Independencia.  Después, tras escucharse unas detonaciones, otras tres personas abatidas a balazos fueron localizadas en el cruce de Laurel e Independencia.  En ese lugar, los paramédicos auxiliaron a otra personas herida gravemente.  En el cruce de Granados y Gardenia también fueron ubicadas otras tres personas sin vida.  Trascendió que en el cruce de Mirto y Naranjo habría otras tres personas sin vida, pero esto no ha sido confirmado.  Ejecutan a mujer en García  El cuerpo de una mujer de entre 30 o 35 años fue localizado abandonado a la orilla de los carriles hacia el poniente del Libramiento Noroeste, a la altura del Bulevar Luis Donaldo Colosio, en García.  Extraoficialmente la Policía Ministerial asegura que testigos señalaron haber visto que, alrededor de las 23:00 horas, la camioneta Explorer, la cual era conducida por la mujer, fue interceptada por grupo de delincuentes.  Cuando los hombres intentaron despojarla de su vehículo, la mujer opuso resistencia, por lo que le dispararon, dejando el cadáver en el lugar.  Presuntamente los delincuentes se llevaron la camioneta con dos menores en su interior, uno de 4 y otro de 6 años, pero esto no ha sido confirmado por las autoridades.  Tiran en el Centro a 3 mutilados  Tres cuerpos descuartizados fueron encontrados sobre la vía pública en donde fueron regados por hombres armados que viajaban en varias camionetas, en el Centro de la Ciudad.  Los cuerpos desmembrados se encontraban sobre la calle Artículo 123 entre Calzada Madero y la Avenida Colón.  Antes de darse a la fuga, los delincuentes realizaron disparos al aire para alertar a la Policía.  Junto a los cuerpos descuartizados los delincuentes dejaron dos narcomensajes dirigidos a un grupo rival del crimen organizado, pero no se reveló su contenido exacto.  Peritos de la Procuraduría de Justicia estatal se encuentran recabando evidencia en la escena del crimen.  Dejan a 3 ejecutados en Guadalupe  Tres hombres fueron encontrados ejecutados a balazos y esposados en el interior de una camioneta, en el Fraccionamiento Nueva Joya, en Guadalupe.  El reporte del hallazgo se realizó alrededor de las 21:00 horas en el cruce de la Avenida Plutarco Elías Calles y la calle México, a donde se movilizaron los diferentes cuerpos policiacos para realizar las investigaciones.  Una fuente señaló que dos de los occisos estaban en la cajuela de una camioneta XTrail plateada, mientras que el otro fue hallado en el asiento trasero.  El informante indicó que los tres cuerpos presentan impactos de bala, que están esposados con las manos por la espalda y encintados de las piernas.  Aparentemente, por el estado en el que fueron encontrados los cadáveres, las autoridades establecieron que éstos fueron dejados por la mañana, después de que los asesinaron en otro lugar.  La fuente dijo que ni dentro de la camioneta ni en el pavimento fueron encontrados casquillos de bala, y que no fue localizado ningún narcomensaje.  Hallan a 3 ejecutados en la Col. Florida  Vecinos reportaron el hallazgo de tres hombres ejecutados en la Colonia Florida.  Los hechos fueron reportados alrededor de las 17:00 horas en la calle Anastasio Parrodi y Aquiles Serdán.  En el lugar, de acuerdo con vecinos, se escucharon detonaciones de arma de fuego por lo que se presume que los delincuentes primero ejecutaron a las víctimas y posteriormente les intentaron prender fuego.  En una pared los delincuentes dejaron un narcomensaje pintado con aerosol que decía: ""Estos son Z. Att. CDG. Saludos. Jo..."".  Descuartizan a 3 custodios en Cadereyta  Por la mañana, poco antes de las 7:00 horas, los cuerpos de tres celadores del Penal de Cadereyta que hace dos días habían sido levantados fueron dejados descuartizados a las puertas del reclusorio.  De acuerdo con los primeros informes, los cuerpos de los celadores fueron dejados debajo de una palmera en el camellón central de la carretera que pasa frente al Penal, al parecer por un grupo de hombres que viajaba en varios vehículos.  Hallan a mujer sin vida en San Jerónimo  El hallazgo de un cuerpo sin vida movilizó a las autoridades policiacas, en el sector de San Jerónimo.  El hallazgo fue reportado por una llamada anónima alrededor de las 7:00 horas en el cruce de San Jerónimo y J. Luna Ayala, a espaldas del Colegio Mexicano.  Al llegar al lugar, las autoridades encontraron el cuerpo sin vida de una mujer que no tenía la cabeza, estaba amarrada de las manos por la parte delantera y en el pecho tenía una cartulina con un mensaje, del cual no se informó su contenido.  Descuartizan a escoltas de Medina  A las 7:40, los cuerpos de los dos hombres hallados descuartizados y envueltos en costales en la avenida Chapultepec y Arteaga, en Guadalupe, fueron identificados como escoltas del Gobernador Rodrigo Medina.  Los restos de los integrantes del Grupo SWAT, que sólo fueron identificados por sus apodos como ""El Chivo"" y ""El Negro"", fueron dejados en costales y una cubeta, alrededor de las 7:40 horas, frente a un centro comercial HEB.  Una fuente de la Policía Ministerial reveló que con los cuerpos fue dejado un narcomensaje dirigido al Gobernador. El contenido del mensaje fue confirmado por otras fuentes oficiales.  Mueren 5 en tiroteo en Pesquería  Un enfrentamiento entre militares e integrantes de la delincuencia organizada dejó como saldo cinco presuntos delincuentes muertos, tres detenidos y tres personas liberadas que se encontraban plagiadas.  Los hechos se registraron alrededor de las 10:15 horas en un área baldía que está entre la calle Agualeguas, que está sin pavimentar, y el Arroyo Los Piojos, en la Colonia Jesús María, en Pesquería.  Hallan a ejecutado en Guadalupe  Un hombre fue encontrado sin vida maniatado y con impactos de bala en el pecho, en un lote baldío de la Col. Dos Ríos.  Los hechos fueron reportados a las 7:40 horas en la avenida Río Bravo y el Camino a las Escobas, informaron los puestos de emergencia.  De acuerdo con informes extraoficiales, fueron unas personas que pasaban por el lugar quienes reportaron los hechos, acudiendo hasta el lugar policías municipales, quienes confirmaron los hechos.  En el lugar, el hombre fue hallado con el torso desnudo, quien vestía solo un pantalón gris y estaba con sus manos amarradas por la espalda.  Lo hallan asesinado a golpes en Canteras  Un hombre fue encontrado asesinado presuntamente a golpes en lo alto del Cerro de la Loma Larga, en la Colonia Canteras, en San Pedro.  Una fuente de la Policía Ministerial reportó que a las 15:00 horas recibieron el reporte de detonaciones de arma de fuego en el citado cerro, y al acudir varios uniformados sampetrinos encontraron al occiso tirado boca abajo.  Según las primeras inspecciones realizadas por las autoridades al cadáver, éste presenta golpes y una herida en la cabeza, que no se ha determinado si también es una lesión por contusión o por un disparo.

And no, I won't disclose how I did it (rest assured a lot of Sherlock Holmesing was performed).  *S2 - Internet detectives™*  In all seriousness, I would like to sit down and talk to /r/hon about leaks for a moment. I understand that Reddit doesn't like censorship and doesn't like being manhunted. Put yourself in our shoes, however. We don't ""censor"" leaked information because we enjoy banning people or because we like keeping stuff from you.  In the case of the last patch, it really was rude. We went through all the trouble of creating abbreviations for all the features to have the community do a guessing game only to have people like you spoil it for everybody. I wasn't the one who came up with the idea but I can tell you that the people who came up with it are now less optimistic of doing something like that again. When S2 decides to interact with the community in a fun way and you ruin it purposely by spreading leaked information on Reddit (and then gloating about how we wont be able to track you down, I might add), you're basically discouraging us from doing cool stuff for you in the future.  **TLDR:** When Willy Wonka invites you for a tour in his magical factory, don't spend the whole tour stealing his magic recipe for the everlasting gobstopper.

t5_2r497,PashaB,1308270068,"Well, I disagree with a lot of things you say. In my opinion you made a poor choice in attaching your real gamer name when leaking info. I mean, you did know they can ban (or so I hope). When did the idea of attaching your real gamer name seem like a good idea?   On the other hand this brings another rather scary point. Anyone can just found leaked info on pastebin and then attach any gamer name they want to their reddit account, resulting in a ban on that user.   I like to read leaked patch notes (and so does everyone else according to the upvotes), I don't care if S2 doesn't want us reading them, and to be honest they really can't stop people from posting on reddit. Still, the fact that attaching ANYONES HoN gamername on an anonymous post on a different forum (i.e. reddit) can get you banned is very shady because anyone can just abuse it.   edit: Just read Nigma's post. Well I suppose you just can't attach ANYONE'S username and they'll insta ban it. From what Nigma is saying they look into it with their team of ""S2 - Internet detectives™"" (yes a joke, but basically people from S2). Still, that leaves these bans to S2's discretion and seeing as they censor information on all their bans, it's still a tad bit shady. ",™

t5_2qh63,tkwelge,1308439717,"Wait wait wait.  This article completely misses the point. It is merely a collection of straw man arguments, misrepresentations, and a complete befuddlement at what many libertarians are actually saying.  &gt;Let’s start by noting that I am not claiming any right at all. Protectionism, if implemented, wouldn’t be implemented by me. It would be implemented by the U.S. Government, and would be legitimate—if it is legitimate—for the same reasons all our other legitimate laws are legitimate:   Wow, laws are laws because it's the law!  &gt;Like it or not, even a capitalist economy is a system, in which your actions affect other people. Your freedom to swing your fist ends, famously, at the tip of my nose, and what you buy and don’t buy affects other people.  I like when people mention things like this as if no libertarian has really thought about it before.  These are the sort of issues that are discussed in libertarianism 101 for fuck's sake.  Libertarians don't define ""freedom"" as ""the ability to do anything that you want.""  Libertarians define freedom as a lack of the initiation of violence.  It is oxymoronic to argue that one could have the ""freedom"" to punch somebody else in the face, by the non aggression principle.     &gt;Even more importantly, your own economic actions don’t mean anything except in the context of a system that you didn’t create. You don’t enjoy the income you enjoy—which is what gives you the very ability to buy things disputed above—solely because of your own efforts. You enjoy that income because, among other things, you were born into a society which had a per-capita GDP of $47,000 during your working lifetime.   Ah!  The ""no man is an island"" straw man.  Any real libertarian is not making that argument.  Of course human beings cooperate and benefit from cooperation.  That's what markets are, cooperation!  Government bureaucracy is simply another form of cooperation, and not a superior one.   &gt;None of this is to deny that a reasonable amount of economic freedom is a good thing. But you get into trouble when you elevate it, like any other good, into an absolute. Try absolutizing national security, traditional values, law enforcement, self expression, religious piety, intellectual sophistication, social order, … Get my point?  Once again, have you ever even spoken to a libertarian?  Libertarianism is simply based on only one absolute.  That is the non aggression principle.  This author defines libertarianism with the help of the voices in his head, apparently.    &gt;The libertarian economic model is a model based on free markets. That is, it is based on the idea that free market economics describes both the way the economy is (insofar as it works well) and the way it should be.   There is no ""libertarian economic model"" in the sense that the author is speaking in.  Libertarianism is less interested in how the economy ""should be"" than it is interested in the non aggression of force.  Of course the free flow of ideas and goods is superior to the constricted trade of such things.  You are free to start a commune and implement any economic model that you can think of, but don't use violent force or theft to accomplish that goal.  &gt;The key idea of this free market economics is equilibrium. That is to say, free market economics holds that if market forces are allowed free play, then the prices and production of things will reach natural equilibria that are the most efficient outcome that could exist.  All markets reach equilibrium.  Again, you are making no sense.  Even a controlled market will reach an equilibrium, and the market will still reach a general equilibrium, it will just be different in certain ways.  There is no ""most efficient outcome that could exist.""  The economy is always in flux and needs to be able to make changes accordingly.  Controlling one aspect of the economy or another through force can interrupt this process.  There is no ""ideal"" equilibrium.  There are simply forced equilibrium levels and free equilibrium levels.    &gt;To a huge (but not total) extent, this is true. (I studied economics at the University of Chicago; trust me, I know this story.)  I'd get my money back.  &gt;But there’s a catch. Equilibria only balance properly if nobody puts a “thumb on the scale” anywhere in the economic system and distorts it.   Once again, the data is always in flux and the market is either responding to natural cooperation or the initiation of violent coercion.  The argument has nothing to do with ""Equilibria balancing properly.""  Government force is simply more data entering the system, data that is based on theft and violence.    &gt;All bets are also off—this is the key—about any individual “free” market decision being valid. Why? Because the market isn’t free anymore. You can’t play by free market rules when you’re not in a free market.   Wrong.  You are either initiating violence or theft or you aren't.  You can play by free market rules in an unfree environment. You simply have to put the guns down.  &gt;Try playing fair when the game is rigged. That’s not fairness, it’s suicide.  It's called ""not doubling down on corruption and evil.""  You're pitting countries against eachother, when it is only all of us vs the elite that seeks to control trade.  Let's look at who are real enemies are and do our best not to become them.  &gt;Whenever libertarians buy foreign goods that are cheaper because of all these practices, they encourage them.  Not necessarily.  The underlying economic effects of the policies that you mentioned are playing out negatively in the home countries that distort trade too.  Isolating countries doesn't seem to have a good track record of encouraging freedom either.  Iran is isolated.  North Korea is isolated.  Cuba is isolated.  Several dictatorships around the world are isolated, and that isolation empowers them further.  North Korea can call us the great satan and blame us for all of their problems along with Iran.  Innocent people starved and died due to economically isolating Iraq after the gulf war.    Responding to protectionism with protectionism simply makes all of us victims.  Other countries are not necessarily initiating violence against us when they sell us cheaper products, but we are certainly initiating violence against our own people by telling people what they can and cannot buy and who they can and cannot trade with.  Inevitably, protectionism leads to crony capitalism, and an escalation of global trade wars.  Protectionism will not lead to free markets or freedom in any way, shape, or form.    I'm sorry, but do you even truly understand what the libertarian argument against protectionism is?  &gt;© 2011 Copyright  Ian Fletcher - All Rights Reserved   Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!

t5_2qh9a,GerkSprongle2,1308454745,"Here's a Cliff notes on survivors,if you can find one single survivor story that doesn't sound like a fantasy let me know,for example do any of you believe this story?.Today's sad holocaust tale comes from Ebi Gabor.   Ebi was only 16 years old when the evil Nazi's aptured her in Hungary. The Nazi's put 80 jews into each box car, and sent them to the death camp of Auschwitz. There was no food or water, and only a single poop bucket in the middle of the cattle car. The jews would drink their own pee just to survive.    When a jew died in the cattle car, the other jews would fight to sleep on the body.   At Auschwitz, Ebi saw people gassed or tortured to death, and killed by dogs.   The jews had no breakfast for breakfast-only coffee. The coffee was laced with medicine to stop the jews from menstruating. 5 jews had to share a single bowl of soup for lunch. For dinner the jews only got a piece of bread.    Miraculously, Ebi survived because her future husband used to throw cheese and sausage to her over the fence. Her future husband somehow got the cheese and sausage to throw to her, even though the jews only got 1 bowl of soup for 5 people. It's even more remarkable that her future husband managed to get the sausage and cheese while they were both in the death camp.    Ebi survived 3 other death camps. Below is a picture of Ebi, 3 months after she was liberated from the death camp where she only had a single piece of bread to eat all day. http://hopelutheranchurch.net/images/ebi.jpg Looks pretty healthy to me especially after only three months out from camp.  Or how about this one? Today's sad holocaust tale comes from Manya and Major Kornblit.   Manya and major were teenage sweethearts when the Germans invaded. They were almost captured by the Nazi's, but they hid in a haystack that was 3 stories high. Good thing, because the Nazi's machine gunned everyone else.   But then they got hungry, so they went to work for the germans who had just finished machine gunning everyone in their town.   The Nazi's took Manya to the Auschwitz death camp. Manya heard people scream in the gas chambers. She can still hear them screaming.   Then the Nazi's needed laborers in Czechslovakia, so Manya volunteered. Lucky for her, because the Nazi's killed all the jews who saw the gas chambers, so they would remain a secret.   Miraculously, Major also survived the death camps. Manya and Major found one another in Poland. They had survived a combined 13 death camps.   Miraculously, Manya's brother also survived the death camps.  Why would anyone lie about the figures? Jews initially claimed that ""2,000,000 people, mostly jews"" were ""exterminated"" at Mauthausen; Now claim only 14,000 jews died there    The following is a direct quote from Encyclopaedia Britannica (1963), page 288:  ""At Mauthausen, one of the extermination camps in Austria, close to 2,000,000 people, mostly Jews, were exterminated between 1941 and 1945""    Now, the death toll has been revised at bit, well, quite a lot really:   ""An estimated 197,464 prisoners passed through the Mauthausen camp system between August 1938 and May 1945. At least 95,000 died there. More than 14,000 were Jewish.""  Or what about these liars?

t5_2qimj,stikeymo,1308482234,"This comes off the back of a highly dubious Sunday Times article, which is debunked fairly effectively on [Digital Spy](http://forums.digitalspy.co.uk/showthread.php?t=1465431&amp;page=110) (I found this linked to in the comments on the [F1 Fanatic](http://www.f1fanatic.co.uk/2011/06/19/sunday-times-claims-bbc-drop-f1-2013/) article).  **TLDR**: The story originated in a pro-Tory newspaper, the Sunday Times. Its F1 editor is openly wanting F1 to go to Sky. Hence, the article is best ignored as it is inaccurate throughout.    &gt;1) ""Its contract to screen F1 for five seasons until 2013 will cost £300m. - incorrect. It is well known that the contract costs BBC about £200m over 5 years, with the next contract increased to £235m. I guess that may factor in production costs, but as far as I know they are minimal and definitely would not amount to an extra £20m per year. &gt; &gt;2) ""At about £3m per race, it is the most expensive BBC programme being broadcast."" - incorrect. As the first point of £300m is wrong, the second point is also wrong. At 19 races, each race costs BBC about £2.1m. In my book, that is not £3m. The point ""it is the most expensive BBC programme being broadcast"" is factually incorrect. You cannot compare 5 hours of programming on BBC1 at £3m with a drama at 9pm on BBC1 which typically costs about £600,000. In fact, going on the £2.1m figure, F1 costs BBC about £420,000 per hour. I've even excluded things like the F1 Forum and Practice with that figure and all the other stuff they do, in reality the figure will be lower than that. Some dramas on BBC1 only get 4.5m viewers and cost £600,000, whereas with F1 you get you're hard to reach 16 to 34 audience, it doesn't cost much and you get at least 4.5m viewers on average per race. Everyone wins. &gt; &gt;3) ""An insider said the cost of covering 19 F1 races was more than the entire budget of BBC4."" - again depends on whether the £60m per year figure is correct, because its the first time I've seen it. BBC4 costs £55m per year, so if the £60m per year figure for F1 is wrong, then the entire article is spouted with inaccuracy and riddles. &gt; &gt;4) ""The source said the BBC did not intend to rebid for the F1 contract when it expired in November 2013."" - in which case, why did you have a scaremongering title saying 'BBC AXES FORMULA ONE'. Axes suggests you're terminating the contract early. No early termination is being seeked hear if you are to believe the article. Besides, they would not rebid for a contract an entire one and a half years before you would even begin discussing it. &gt; &gt;5) ""It has emerged that F1 costs £1 a head for every viewer, compared with the average 7p an hour broadcast cost for BBC1 and BBC2."" - http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/assets...rts_rights.pdf ; page 35 - Formula 1 2009 - hit in every category, only one of two events to do this. - as a said at the time (page 36) : ""[✂ Redacted] is the outstanding success, significantly exceeding all of its reach, average audience and cost per viewer hour targets"" - is almost certainly referring to F1 - hence this on Page 4: ""Formula 1 has been a significant success in 2009/10, exceeding all of its reach, average audience and cost per viewer hour target"" - report was done earlier this year into the process of acquiring sports rights - see page 33: ""Formula 1 and Premier League highlights attract a younger (16-34) male audience that is otherwise hard to reach...."" &gt; &gt;6) ""Apart from the British Grand Prix, most races attract between 2m and 4m viewers."" - http://forums.autosport.com/index.php?showtopic=112436 - enough said at this point - only one race has dipped under 4m, and that was because it was against a Ford Super Sunday triple header on Sky Sports &gt; &gt;7) ""It costs more for each hour than even the most expensive dramas such as South Riding, Cranford and Doctor Who."" - again, this depends on whether the £60m figure is actually true. I mean, why have we only just heard about this now? They've had the rights for 2 and a half years, yet we've only just heard about the £60m figure despite numerous source saying £40m. &gt; &gt;8) ""The proposal to dump F1 will be among a package of measures to be put to the BBC Trust in the Autumn."" - so only towards the end of the article do you actually tell us that they haven't axed it, despite the headline saying to the contrary?

This section doesn't compare to Subversion, and just says ""lol it's slow"". I do not deal with massive repositories very often, and when I do, some checkout time is fine. Being a web developer, I don't deal with massive projects. I know you do, because you use every framework under the library under the sun to achieve one feature in it while including the rest of its 2mb bloat. How do I know this? Well, you're pushing Git.  Git is small? Hard disk space is cheap. I have about 2 and a half terabytes of free space hanging around, and 25mb vs 60mb is not too much, honestly.  The Staging Area? So I can commit certain files. Great.  Distributed? You know what I do when my hardware fails? I either cry, or, in the more likely case I have a backup, I use a backup.  Any workflow? No, it isn't. It's the pull everything down and push it back up workflow. It's the Git workflow™  GitHub? The author actually admits he's really biased here too. The GitHub community is goddamn awful. The design is basically the only good thing about GitHub, and even that only adds so much.  Easy to Learn? There is no way to objectively measure that.",™

t5_2fwo,BorgDrone,1308596495,"&gt; Try running PPC applications on an intel machine and tell me you think applications can just be copied over.  Actually, yes, that Just Works™. If the application is not in the form of a fat binary containing PPC and Intel code it will just transform the PPC code to x86 on the fly (and since the x86 CPU's are much faster, it will run faster than on the original PPC machine the file came from.)  In fact, you can pull the hard disk from a machine running OS 10.5 (the last version to support the PPC architecture), install it into an Intel machine and it can and will actually boot from that disk, and everything will Just Work™. All your settings will be there, all your apps will be there and work, all your hardware will be supported.   Really.   Try it, I'm not making this up.  Unlike a PC, a Mac has a far more advanced firmware system. OpenBoot on PPC machines and EFI on Intel Mac's. The firmware knows about the Mac's partition format and the HFS+ filesystem. An OSX install contains both the PPC and Intel kernel and all necessary drivers for all Mac hardware. Since the firmware knows about the filesystem it goes looking for the correct kernel in /System/Library/CoreServices , BootX on a PPC and boot.efi on Intel. It will then load the necessary drivers and start the kernel. As soon as that is done, all other application code is in the form of Fat Binaries (a single executable containing PPC and Intel code, possibly in 32 and 64-bit flavours, so it could be 4 versions).  The system will automatically and transparently load the correct one.   So, yes, applications and even whole OSes can just be copied over and everything will Just Work™. I think it's pretty sad sign that people don't even consider this possible, let alone expect it to work that way. This is how technology should work, and this is why I gladly pay a little extra for a Mac, they are not only beautifully designed on the outside, the insides are awesome too. I actually expect Apple to pull the same trick when they move towards ARM cpu's in their laptops, everything will Just Work™ no matter if you use an x86 desktop or an ARM laptop, mark my words. ",™

t5_2qh1i,NotFatSlashUglyChick,1308605146,"**Things I learned About Being a Woman on Reddit:**  1. Being a fat female is the worst thing in the entire world, despite what Dove® tells you.   Don't even try to defend yourself. Just run.   2. Second worst is being ugly.  If you are ugly, you clearly have no business being alive.  So really, just get off Reddit, unless you post pictures of your boobies, then you can stay.  3. If you are fat or ugly, you probably need to trick a man into being interested into you.  This can be done in a variety of ways.  A. Lying B. Becoming Pregnant, or C. a combination of the two.  Males must be veeeerryy careful to avoid this, because we females can be veeeeeerrryyy sneaky.   4. If you are female, and have ever been in a serious relationship, which you are now not in, it’s probably your fault because “**you’re crazy.**”  You should change yourself **immediately** if you have any hope of attracting your dream man... a fat nerd.  5. You must be pretty.  Not in a made-up way.  You must actually have hit the genetic lottery and be flawless without make-up.  For this you will receive endless vulgar compliments. You're welcome.  6. The fact that you're a PRETTY WOMAN must come up ""accidentally.""  Explaining that you are female, or posting a picture in which it is clear that you are both female and attractive will knock you back to ""fat chick"" status. *Note female beauty may incite anger in some regardless of your adherence to the rules, and you will probably be called a “cum slut” or something similar by somebody, don’t take it personally, this means they like you! (it’s like kindergarten, don’t question it).  7. If you are Natalie Portman or Zooey Deschanel, then you have been jizzed on by much of Reddit, many, many times... ladies... attempt to look like these woman, but not TOO hard... because you know... you have to be beautiful without trying... it’s confusing... I know, because these photoshopped pictures are anything but “natural.”  8. You must only praise males.  Otherwise they will become angered and you will, again, be knocked back to ""fat chick"" status.  They become less angered if they think you are male, you may use this strategy.  9. You are a sex object. Start acting like it.  This means only making your opinion known when appropriate.  Again, pretending to be male may allow you to inject your male-disguised wisdom into a thread, and may even result in a ""totally bro.""  10. When men don't want sex, they are very hungry, you should probably use your diminished mental capacity to just make them a sandwich.  Isn't it better when we just pretend that feminism means females are allowed to show their boobies in public? ",®

Other anatomists classify the thumb separately, noting that it has a much different articulation with the metacarpal bone (a saddle joint) and is composed of one metacarpal bone and only two phalanges. The nerves that innervate the various muscles controlling the thumb include branches of the radial nerve, branches of the median nerve, and the deep palmar branch of the ulnar nerve.  &gt;Mosby's Medical Dictionary, 8th edition. © 2009, Elsevier.

It's a complete non sequitur. You fail at thinking.  &gt; So obviously not my point at all you are truly unintelligent.  That's not a rebuttal.  You claimed their smiling, dancing and having fun is a product of their ""fear"" and ""anger"". You're a blithering moron. My *cat* could outwit you.  &gt; Men can dance if they want.  Oh, really? Thanks for your permission! As a Real Man™, I wouldn't *dare* do anything that *you* didn't approve of. After all, I have standards -- yours -- and I grow fearful whenever I even think I might not be meeting your expectations! Because that's what ""pride"" means!  &gt; You are drawing a stupid connection between something like dancing at a wedding and lip syncing to a pop song and dancing like a woman in public.  Ahh.. gotcha. The shape of your mental straight jacket is slowly revealing itself:  (1) Men are permitted to dance, but only in officially sanctioned contexts.   (2) Men *shall not* dance to pop music.   (3) Men *shall not* lip sync.   (4) Exceptions can be made for #2 and #3 at home, in private, with the blinds drawn, so nobody can see them.

t5_2qpol,rednukleus,1308616811,"In this seminal work I lampoon the oft-disparaged online discussion forum *Yahoo! Answers*. Yahoo! Answers, or Yahoo! Q &amp; A, as it is known to any who entered a coma state in 2005 and are emerging today, was created on July 5th 2005. Intended as a vehicle for hive mind knowledge sharing and collective enlightenment, Yahoo!® Answers instead serves as an eidetic drool rag of the bottom rung of human efforts in communication.  To capture salient characteristics of the remarkable works of ignorance found on Yahoo! Answers and distill their essence, I employed a variety of literary techniques. A lack of capitalization and punctuation, casual attention to spelling, and poor, often redundant word choice set the tone. Jilted, agrammatical phrasing suggests confusion during the formative moments of the question, decoupled from any revision of the asker's final thought, which may have been marginally more cogent than what is presented to the reader. Explicitly requesting an affirmative or negative response serves as a preliminary bit of chaff and doubles as a way of informing the askee of the difficulty on the part of the asker in interpreting the contextual implications communicated in the leading stanza of the run-on statement. To maximize the degree of obfuscation of the primary interrogative, entirely irrelevant details about the individual's particular purchase are presented in a manner that highlights their perceived importance. This second wave of chaff, no more grammatically sound than the central question, encourages repeated readings via its misleading effect of distraction. ",®

t5_2qh1i,Gewehr43,1308689032,"“Ohshitwhatwasthat?” I said to no one, alone in my cramped little cockpit. I strained my ears to hear it again; any sign that something was amiss on yonder side of firewall. Alas there was nothing more. It was all in my head. Just as my heartrate began slowing down to triple digits…  pop BANG  “oh fuck”  Now the little Lycoming was definitely in peril; taking myself and the aircraft along with it. Every few seconds something would pop and clatter. I nervously scanned the instruments again and sure enough the oil temp was pegged at max. Though all the other gages were fine, it was obvious this engine was in serious trouble. Soon the individual pops lost their identity in a cacaphony of noise not normal to this world. Metal screeching on metal and the death howls of the engine filled the cockpit. Just recalling that sound fills me with sense of dread deep down in the pit of my stomach.  Amazingly, and to its credit, the engine was still putting out a decent amount of power. I could maintain altitude, but only at a reduced speed. At this point, however, I was trying to figure out ways to cool the engine down. I reduced the throttle and rpm’s, and put the aircraft in a shallow descent hoping to increase the cooling air across the engine. (It was an air-cooled engine.)  It was about this time that I began to hear my instructor’s voice in my head. “That big, fat wing out there may give this bird great short field takeoff capabilities, but if you ever lose an engine in this beast, it’s going to glide like a brick.” Wonderful. Bastard was right though. The Maule was designed to get off the ground in a hurry, but the same characteristics that allowed her to do that also gave her the glidepath of a dead duck. It didn’t help that the only fields near me that I could use for an emergency landing were ripe with midsummer’s harvests of corn stalks and beans. Landing on I-94 was not an option for many reasons, never mind the traffic at the time.  All this left me with one option: nurse this fucking airplane back to Marshall.  At two thousand feet and dragging along to the chorus of a dying engine, I kept waiting, hoping to see Marshall’s runway come slithering out of the afternoon haze. It was a huge relief to finally make out the 3500’ asphalt strip nestled between to water towers, as it slowly slipped into view. There was another problem, however.  The winds that day favored a landing from the west (i.e. flying eastbound). That meant that I’d have to fly a full traffic pattern and come around to land in the opposite direction from which I was heading. BANG BANG BANG POP BANG BANG POP… Two eight lima voiced her objection to that idea.  About two miles from the field, I announced my situation on the radio:  “Marshall traffic, Maule two eight lima is 2 miles east, inbound straight in runway two eight. I am losing my engine, please clear the runway at Marshall.” I impressed even myself. The coolness of my voice was almost mechanical, despite the fact that I was sitting a few inches higher in the seat.  Just then I looked down and felt a sudden relief as the oil temp was slowly dropping to normal parameters. Relief turned to terror when I looked at the adjacent gage. Oil pressure was zero. Catastrophic failure no longer was an if, but a when. With no lubrication coursing through its metal veins, this engine was doomed and it was only a matter of time before one of several things happened. One, the engine would fail outright and leave me with zero power. Two, the engine would overheat, catch fire, and turn Maule Two Eight Lima into Maule Flying Crematorium ™. Three, the engine would fail, then windmill, then catch fire. From there, see option two.  Any lingering thoughts I’d had about flying the whole pattern were, at this point, squeezed completely out of my head and I was committed to doing an against-the-books straight-in landing.  Limping in from a mile out, I called again:  “Marshall traffic, Maule two eight lima inbound on the straight in approach runway two eight. I have lost oil pressure and my engine is failing. Clear the runway at Marshall.”  It was about then that my heart sank. Out in the distance I could make out the shape of a Piper Saratoga, a big six-seat monster of an airplane, trundling its way on to the far end of the runway, clearly lining up for takeoff in the opposite direction of which I was intending to land. SHIT!  “Marshall traffic, clear the runway at Marshall! Repeat clear the runway at Marshall! Maule two eight lima is making straight in runway two eight with a failing engine!” That calm coolness I mentioned a minute ago? Not any more. I’m sure my voice squeaked like an 8th grader at a middle school dance.  Time seemed to stop as the big Piper remained stationary on the runway, its wide nose seeming to grin at me as my engine coughed its last breath. Finally, the Saratoga began a sharp U-turn and rolled off the runway, its pilot seemingly reluctant to do so. God forbid he burn an extra gallon of gas while he waited for me. Dick.  Just as the last line of trees at the approach end of the runway flashed under my aircraft, the little Lycoming decided it had had enough. The silence that enveloped the cockpit was surreal in its total contrast to the chaos of just a few seconds before. I can still remember kind of hovering there, gliding in the last few yards to the runway threshold. It felt like minutes, just dangling there in silence, but was likely only a second or two until the tires thumped unceremoniously down on the asphalt.  I used my remaining momentum to coast off the runway and into the adjacent grass. I got out of the aircraft and plopped down in the grass next to her. Even as the Piper [s]roadblock[/s] Saratoga roared overhead, I could hear two eight lima’s engine tick as it cooled in the afternoon breeze. A few minutes later, Pete landed and gave me a ride back up to the main buildings. I went home that afternoon and just layed on my bed staring at the ceiling. I’m a big believer that so long as you live to learn from them, mistakes are okay. I made some mistakes that day and boy howdy, the knowledge I gained then could fill volumes.  So what happened to Maule 9228L? The next day I came into work to find the aircraft nosed up to the maintenance bay, its engine cowlings removed. My boss (the same shithead who sent me to get the aircraft in the first place) didn’t believe my story. So, he shoved the aircraft back from the hangar and hopped in. Miraculously, the Lycoming caught and fired, and though she ran, it wasn’t pretty. I’ve never seen an engine shake that hard on its mounts. It looked like it was about rip itself clean off the aircraft, and of course the sound sent shivers down my spine.  A few hours later the engine was disassembled and stacked neatly on tables surrounding the aircraft. As it turns out the bearing between the crankshaft and the connecting rod on the number two cylinder spun, disintigrated, and entered the oil filter in the form of half a million flakes. As it spun, it cut off the oil passages, so the oil couldn’t flow properly through the engine. This caused the oil temp to rise. However, since the system still had pressure, the oil pressure gage still read good. Once the bearing disintegrated completely, the oil passages had essentially been severed, so the oil was under no pressure. Inside the engine, it looked like a hand grenade had gone off. Pistons, rings, and cylinders were torn to shreds and there were metal flakes everywhere. The engine was more or less scrapped and it was nearly a year before the company could afford to buy a new one and get two eight lima online. ",™

t5_2qh61,strolls,1308700785,"&gt; I don't think it is; I don't see any reason why a made-up word, made up in the last century, would become an irregular noun. As I mentioned, most of our irregular nouns for purposes of pluralization come from a long history of having done it that way, usually because the word comes from a foreign language.  I think it may indeed have come from European use, but the fact of the matter is it *is* spoken (and written) that way. It doesn't matter whether the ""long history"" isn't centuries old - it *is* decades old, and people here in Britain would look at you weird if you said ""legos"".   &gt; I understand that in British English you guys pluralize corporations; I would say ""Sony is making shitty decisions"" where you would say ""Sony are making shitty decisions."" So if we were talking informally about LEGO Group™ and referring to the company as ""Lego"", I would say ""Lego is making fun new sets"" and you would say ""Lego are making fun new sets."" I'm even willing to bet that is where the confusion comes from as you are used to hearing ""Lego"" as the plural when talking about the company, so it sounds natural that ""Lego"" is the plural form of ""Lego.""  No, that's a completely different matter. I didn't realise this was geographically influenced, because I think I would probably use ""Sony is making…"" and ""Sony are making…"" interchangeably, without any thought or reason to the matter (and I think any other British person would).  I can tell you that 3 decades ago my mother would have told me ""clear up that pile of lego off the carpet"" (as, AIUI, an American mother would say ""clean up that pile of legos""). ",™

t5_2qh2p,TheFlyingBastard,1308823387,"&gt; We haven't really addressed why God isn't necessarily a master to those who believe in him, beyond the illusions of free will.   I mentioned the Jews being polytheists earlier. Besides, the bible does say in 2 Corinthians 4:4 that Satan is the god of this world. Sure, they would be a master to his supposed worshipers, but though the True Christian® would see him as a god, not as their master.  &gt; This is also forgetting the point that the whole meme is meant only to show what God cared more about righteousness vs the ""HEY worship me!"" sentiment  Hence my comment. That point didn't really come through very well in this picture. It'd be better to use a different example, I feel, as the two ""masters"" are of an entirely different order.  &gt; But the question still stands, why would the religious tolerate a God that was cool with something inherently evil involving mastery and then piss over people accepting another leader over him--even ALONGSIDE him?  Probably because the bible says that all their leaders are appointed by God. Again, God is a whole new degree of master...ness...ship.

Heck, even Xenocara and a ""non-2.0 licensed"" branch of Apache are being maintained ""inhouse"" at OpenBSD.

t5_2qh03,TitoDriscollseyJr,1308864933,"I still enjoy **Torchlight**. Like an updated Diablo. It's a good purchase, imo, and you can't really go wrong if you like dungeon crawlers and such.  If you want a small like Dungeon Crawler, you could always opt for **Nethack** or **Stone Soup** too. Free, and some could call it *fun.* I enjoy them in small doses.  Years ago I enjoyed **NeverWinter Nights**, and the 2 expansion packs. I would think NWN2 is just as good, but I never checked. Speaking of which, I should probably go reinstall NWN!  I remember loving and enjoying **Ultima IV** on the Apple ][e, and was overjoyed when I saw [a remake](http://xu4.sourceforge.net/) being made. Then I read that the PC data files were freeware! Of course, that wasn't *exactly* [the case](http://gamepolitics.com/2011/03/29/ea-uses-dmca-takedown-ultima-iv-downloads), but there are 2 individuals who still have permission to share the Ultima4 files. You can also apparently download the [full Ultima IV from EA as well](http://www.ultimaforever.com/index.php) (they say you'll need DosBox, but if you use the updated engine (xu4) above, it'll run straight from Windows).  Years ago I also played Might and Magic (1 &amp; 2, then World of Xeen, and Darkside of Xeen). I hadn't through much of the series in a while, but Steam showed **Might &amp; Magic® Heroes® VI** on preorder, and it looked quite interesting to me. Haven't yet picked it up, but I am definitely keeping an eye on it, for later.  If you want to stray a bit from Fantasy/RPG, you can go for certain shooters that add in RPG elements, like **Borderlands** or **Mass Effect** or **System Shock 2**. Or if you just want fantasy but not exactly RPG, **Trine** is a *very* nice game (but its a side-scroller/platformer).   .02",®

Unique to Mortgage Litigation is the fact that if you have already lost your home you can still pursue litigation against former lender! Ask representative for details.  In addition, a byproduct of litigation has most often resulted in the banks postponing or halting foreclosure proceedings upon the homeowners who have joined the suit. However, litigation should NOT be seen as a GUARANTEED mechanism to stop foreclosure! See an attorney immediately!  Facing IMMEDIATE foreclosure?

I refused to believe this email was real, but evidence, confirmation from several sources including agents with very close ties with CCP has confirmed it, I refused to believe it veracity.  After reading the CCP Zulu release, we broke down as we became aware of the similar direction between the CCP DevLog and this “leaked email”, we decided to calm down and post this after heavily consulting advisors, ex-game developers and well informed EVE online players.  The email to which we hold no authorship, editing, nor claim to be true based on the fact that we are still in denial/shock even a day after, we are assured to have the “Hilmar” writing style, no-one before other than the original source of our leak reffered to the newsletter as ‘fearless’ and the content of the email certainly goes inline with the poorly received DevBlog message CCP Zulu expressed.  We Do not claim the veracity of this email it came to us via a Drop Box (just as the newsletter), yet the evidence has been mounting all day as we keep digging around and other clues has been pooping up or keep in mind that maybe we Eve News24 are being peons to the well planned machinations of persons willing to destroy CCP.

Scroll all the way to see a bunch of animation light boxes, which are wedges that have a light under them and a surface angled up toward the animator into which (in the good ones anyway) sits a wooden disk with a white Plexiglas™ drawing surface. Embedded in that surface is an [animation peg bar](http://www.cartooncolour.com/catalog/images/plasticpegbar.jpg). That's the cheap, plastic kind that we all had to buy for our Traditional Animation class, but there are a variety of expensive ones, like [this metal one](https://www.currys.com/Products/Media/fl%5CAnimation%5CANI1.jpg). This stuff is all priced kinda high, because it's such niche stuff for such a small demographic.  You can see in the video in the top of that first link the person spinning the disc around using the finger hole below the drawing area. There's also some footage of them drawing with the light on, which lets you see through to a few drawings beneath, so you can line things up properly. The peg bar ensures everything stays registered from page to page, and the oversized paper comes with matching holes punched in it, or you can actually buy an animation peg bar hole punch, which as I recall is also foolishly pricey. One guy at my college bought one, and he sold time with it to his fellow students :) One nice thing that allows is working on any paper you choose.  In the old days, the drawings were shot on film using a film camera. You'd press a button and it would snap one shot and advance one frame of the film. There are typically 2 lights to either side of your work, each at a 45° angle up and to the right and left. The camera is suspended above the table looking straight down, and there's a glass plate over the film area, and another animation peg bar on the table so each paper goes in in exactly the same place, lined up with all the others. The glass plate is usually hinged on the far side so it can lift up about 45° to let you remove one paper and put in the next one.  The camera setups can be homemade, like [this one](http://fc08.deviantart.net/fs42/f/2009/109/8/f/New_Animation_Camera_Stand_01_by_HMontes.jpg), somewhat affordable like [this one](http://inklingstudio.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341d2b8f53ef01157107e150970b-pi) (relatively speaking), a bit more pricey like [this one](http://www.okokchina.com/Files/uppic19/OK.%20STAND%20%28Animation%20Camera%20stand%29%2016F910.jpg), or more battlestationesque, like [this one](http://rutgersmedianet.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/2c_oxberry.gif). We had a kind of ghetto setup at my school, way back in 1996. It looked a lot like [this](http://www.cganimation.net/wp-content/uploads/animation%20desk_2.jpg), although the computer was older, and I think it was an Amiga, and the software on it was actually written by one of the students. It showed you the previous frame you shot on an old television.  Check out the video of [Walt Disney introducing the multiplane camera](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kN-eCBAOw60). You'll see an animator flipping cels (cellulose acetate - the clear sheets animations were inked and painted onto) under the camera for each shot. They were clear so you could see the painted background, and this also let you stack up multiple cels to build up many characters and props doing their own things in a shot. The multiplane camera took the idea of the animation camera to a new level, allowing many separate layers to be filmed at once, each at their own level, allowing for things like out of focus backgrounds that could come into focus as you moved toward them, as well as the feeling of moving 'through' a scene.",™

Players can more accurately judge the jump to the next platform or how far Mario is from a question block  New and familiar abilities add unique game-play strategies to the adventure. Mario can perform a rolling somersault attack or run fast with a dash move.

[ ] It is the fault of the Palestinians that they don't rebuild infrastructure fast enough after we bomb it.  [ ] Arafat walked out on camp David, proving that 100% of Palestinians want war, not peace.  [ ] The Jews are God's chosen people™ and this is the land that was promised to us by a book.  [ ] It is not a genocide until hundreds of thousands of Palestinans are killed and we aren't even close to that yet.  [ ] 100% of Palestinians are terrorists.  [ ] The Arabs drove the Jews from their homeland thousands of years ago so it is about time for some payback.  [ ] Israel has killed fewer people than Iran or Iraq which means we are a peaceful state.  [ ] Carpet bombing an entire country is a perfectly rational response to the kidnapping of a soldier.  [ ] It's not a concentration camp, it's a safety wall!  Therefore, your claim of [Israel wants to kill aid workers] is false and we should continue to send money and military support to Israel.

It happened to be the new CoD that I was looking at, and I challenged him, and won. He promptly shut up. That showed him.  And  &gt; So basically, being girl in a world of male gamers involves plenty of abuse, and bad feedback, but who cares? Us girls have faster reactions anyway, and are more than capable to kick ass!  Just a couple of examples of what really bothers me about Gamer Girls™. They make a grand show about how great they are because they have ovaries and can handle a video game controller, and then wonder why the video game industry doesn't take them seriously.  You're not hot shit just because you can hold your own in a FPS. You're not a goddess on Earth because you play CoD. Get over yourself. You want equality in gaming? Then act like you're an equal.   Also:  &gt; Whenever I talk about games, and E3 and other generally nerdy things, I get a shocked look, and if I questions these looks, I get told “But your a girl…” to which I reply “So what!”  I've very, *very* rarely ever gotten this reaction. Seriously. Who says that anymore? I mean, yes, girls are generally less inclined to be 'nerdy', but they've been coming out of the nerdy closet on mass in the past decade and aren't nearly as much of a rarity in nerd circles anymore. So, chalk this up as another 'get over yourself, Gamer Girl™'.  &gt; I have nothing wrong with the Female marketing, I find it amusing, but why is there no balance? A male version of this type of marketing?  Anyone who goes to E3 or any other gamer convention without their head up their ass will notice that guys significantly outnumber women. Yes, there are a lot more chicks playing games, but there still isn't enough of a fanbase of ladies (especially ladies willing to go to a 'nerd convention') for there to be specific marketing towards us. There is a lot of gender neutral marketing, though. Marketing that aims at *both women and men*. You know, equality? Yeah, there's no hot guys in banana hammocks flexing next to a cutout of an ingame character, but, hey.   **tl;dr Screw you, Gamer Girls™**",™

t5_2r2jt,KristieKrunchBar,1309207042,"I only really know about the Dragon Age issue because some guy made such a huge stink about it. I'll sum it up real quick, though, because I think it's interesting/relevant.   Basically, in Dragon Age, you can choose to be male or female, and then choose if you want to flirt with and start relationships with AI characters (note: not at all a necessary part of game play and is completely at the choice of the player). If you want to play a male and start a relationship with another male, totally up to you. Some guy then wrote in to the developers saying that he spoke for the 'straight male gamer' and that having the *option* of homosexual relationships was an insult to 'straight male gamers' and that they were turning their back on their 'main demographic'. Here's more [info](http://www.nomorelost.org/2011/03/25/straight-male-gamer-told-to-get-over-it-by-bioware/) on it if you want to read about it and see BioWare's response.   The gaming industry is definitely taking some good strides, I'll agree, though. I certainly don't feel unwelcome in the field, at any rate. The growth of casual gaming has also really helped (I know a lot of girls that don't consider themselves gamers, yet have DS's or Wii's). We're definitely moving in the right direction. The only problem is when Gamer Girls™ (who just want to use gaming to sate their need for attention) or when companies like the previously mentioned 'Silicon Sisters' take us two steps back when we just took one forward, ya know?",™

Stop thinking like a short order chef and realize your craft is valuable. It takes time and skill. Even with all that training, it takes even more time to get a project worked out with your client, to make it printable, to consider all the 1001 things that go into a successful design.   You charge your client for all that, because when you bring your skills to bear on his project, you are his surgeon, his hired mercenary, his ambassador to the sale. Would you hire the cheapest, fresh off the campus eye surgeon you could find on Craigslist? How about a rescue professional you need to send into the jungle to rescue the stranded hikers?

First, if there is standing water, it will help splash it out of the puddle.  Second, if all riders take a single line through the mud then it is so so so much easier to fix.  Consider the work of patching a single line through a mud puddle vs. patching a 8 sq ft Pizza Cutter Fuckfest™.    Plus, if there's only a single pizza cutter through the middle of the trail it becomes really easy for everyone to ride past (or manual over) once the trail dries out.    I also find that if people start riding directly through the middle then the people that ride later see a predominate line in the mud and are more likely to ride that same line.  If they see the PCFF™ then they are more likely to try to ride around it which becomes a bigger and bigger and bigger problem.    **tl;dr** don't ride in the mud.  if you must, ride directly though the mud (because it's easier fix later).  edit: phrasing",™

t5_2qh55,hosty,1309286055,"From the [Sucralose FAQ](http://www.splenda.com/faq/no-calorie-sweetener):  &gt;Sucralose, the no-calorie sweetening ingredient in SPLENDA® No &gt;Calorie Sweetener, is about 600 times sweeter than sugar. Like other &gt;tabletop sweeteners, the granulated and packet products contain &gt;small amounts of carbohydrate (less than 1 gram per serving) for &gt;consistent sweetening and to provide volume. These bulking &gt;ingredients are dextrose (packets) and maltodextrin (packets and &gt;granulated). However, the bulking ingredients provide so few calories &gt;per serving that the FDA allows the SPLENDA® No Calorie Sweetener &gt;Products to be labeled no calorie sweeteners, because they provide &gt;less than five calories per serving.  Granted, they don't say exactly how much maltodextrin and dextrose are in a packet, but considering that a packet weighs 1g, the sucralose itself is around 600 times as sweet as sugar, and they aim for the 1g packet to taste like a packet of sugar (usually around 4g), you can expect it to have about 596/600 g of filler (99.3%). If you're diabetic and using a couple of packets in your coffee or something, it's not going to have a huge effect (no more than .993g of sugar would), and it's definitely better than using 4 times the amount of sugar. But if you start using a cup of splenda in baking or something, you're fooling yourself if you think it's sugar free or calorie free.  They do sell splenda in concentrated liquid form, where the only ingredients are sucralose and water. If you're actually concerned about your sugar intake, I'd go with this",®

t5_2rnve,Markus_Antonius,1309293737,"No you don't but the market is riddled with crappy PSUs. Even some good brands that expanded into the PSU market have put some bad batches out there that they had made by third parties. Also, a lot of them slap the peak performance on the box instead of what the PSU is capable of delivering sustained. Unless you buy a brand that specializes in PSUs you have to really know what you're buying, Otherwise 600W is 400W sustained. If you're into intensive gaming you're gonna run up to 450W sustained pretty quickly. I've done measurements to this effect. If your gaming sessions last a couple of hours (as mine do) you don't want to stretch the components all the way to their limits as they undoubtedly will work but have a lifespan that runs just beyond the warranty. I agree anything above 750W is overkill, but having a margin is never a bad thing. It's the very reason German cars last as long as they do ;-)  Edit: for cards like the 6870 the factory recommends 500W+. If they thought 400W was a good idea they would probably say so.  From the powercolor manual for the 6800 series: **A 500 watt or better power supply with one 75 watt 6-pin PCIe connector for the AMD Radeon™ HD 6850 and two 75 watt 6-pin PCIe power connectors for the AMD Radeon HD 6870.**  [Source](http://www.power-color.com/Manual/090106/Radeon_HD_6800_Series_ENG.pdf)  They also recommend picking one that is certified by AMD, list [here](http://support.amd.com/us/certified/power-supplies/Pages/listing.aspx).  The other thing to consider is that *if* your cheap power supply fails, it has the potential to take most of your system out with it.  All that said, anything over 750W is like driving a Ferrari with a limiter. (Unless you're going to install 3 videocards or more, can't think of anything else requiring that much juice...)  Edit 2: I run GTX560 SLI with a 650W so I'm not one of those ""You need a 1000W"" people :-)",™

The meta-analysis corrected problems with a previously published meta-analysis and added more recent findings. **In contrast to the earlier meta-analysis, the current results showed an overall significant positive association between pornography use and attitudes supporting violence against women in nonexperimental studies.** In addition, such attitudes were found to correlate significantly higher with the use of sexually violent pornography than with the use of nonviolent pornography, although the latter relationship was also found to be significant. The study resolves what appeared to be a troubling discordance in the literature on pornography and aggressive attitudes by showing that the conclusions from nonexperimental studies in the area are in fact fully consistent with those of their counterpart experimental studies. This finding has important implications for the overall literature on pornography and aggression. Aggr. Behav. 36:14–20, 2010. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",©

The closest with which I've had to deal is when a reckless statement is made about a trans person. They're not malicious in tone like that gay guy you met — and yes, some gay guys I've met are aggressively invested in pointing out the ""tranny"" as being like them — that is, ♂, ♂, ♂ forever — or in merely de-legitimizing trans women's lives as fraudulent and ha-ha funny.    Most recently, I think it was the Chrissy Lee Polis beating which came up around company where I was not out.  I think someone mis-gendered her, and I said something like, ""I think if she wanted to be called a man or 'he', she would not have changed her name to Chrissy and she would live out her day to day life as a man, not as a woman.""  Others in the room agreed, and this person conceded that they had erred in their ignorant judgement. I did, however, qualify my statement as having met trans people in the past who made it clear that this is what they would say in the same situation.  I just didn't disclose that I was one of those trans people.  There is one guy in my extended social circle, though, I do worry about.  While we have a myriad of acquaintances in the same circles, he is an avowed transphobe as a white cis gay man who thinks that all trans people are A) ""MTF"" and B) ""transgenderists"".  I gather sometimes that his obsessive sense of awareness for trans people has been set off by my stepping up softly in such moments of correction and by the point that my narrative, personality, and my range of interests generally seem ""impossibly"" unlikely for a ""real woman"" or sslt.  So I must eye him like a hawk and keep him just beyond arm's reach.  My worry is that he'll run with an assumption, out me pre-emptively, and then force me into a corner to ""prove"" that his outing was — oops! — just an inaccurate presumption.  If he does this, then yes, I'll want to beat the tree out of him, but he holds powerful sway in the shared circles in which we run and he preceded my arrival to these circles.  I want to believe that the content of my contributions would trump this, but with him I doubt it.    Did I happen to mention he's a white, cis gay man in queer space and has great esteem by straight people and non-able-bodied people in the process (he works on accessibility services)?",♂

t5_2qh03,ne1av1cr,1309358891," I Am Alive From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia For other uses, see I Am Alive (disambiguation). I Am Alive  Developer(s)	Darkworks (former) Ubisoft Shanghai Publisher(s)	Ubisoft Engine	LEAD Platform(s)	Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii Release date(s)	2011 Genre(s)	Action Mode(s)	Single-player Media/distribution	DVD, Blu-ray Disc I Am Alive is an upcoming action video game developed by Ubisoft Shanghai and published by Ubisoft. It will be released on the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Microsoft Windows and Wii. The game takes place in Chicago after a major-scale earthquake has destroyed the city and separated it from mainland, while the rest of the world suffers a water crisis.[1] Contents [hide] 1 Plot 2 Gameplay 3 Development 4 References 5 External links [edit]Plot  The game takes place in Chicago after a 10.3 Mw earthquake destroys the city and the rescue team fails to save the survivors. Millions are dead, and the city is leveled. The protagonist, a middle-class man named Adam Collins, has to evade enemies, keep from becoming dehydrated, find his missing girlfriend and stay alive in a crumbled city of hate.[2] Adam also has to evade certain citizens throughout the game, as they'll do anything in order to take his belongings, and use them as their own. [edit]Gameplay  The player controls Adam Collins in a first person perspective. The player can use various tactics to stay alive, including using an empty gun to threaten enemies, finding food and water around the city in order to keep Adam alive and healthy and use of actual live weapons, including pistols, machine guns, and grenades if found. The player can also drive abandoned vehicles. Driving vehicles will be in the traditional third-person view, and running or walking can be toggled between first and third person. [edit]Development  The game was first rumored to be in development in July 2008, when it was told that Assassin's Creed producer Jade Raymond was working on a new game. It was later announced at E3 2008, along with a trailer. It was later revealed that Raymond was not working on the game.[3] Development of the game experienced various delays until it was confirmed that the original developers, Darkworks, would not be working on it any longer due to a ""mutual decision"" and that the studio had other obligations, and that the game would instead be finished at Ubisoft Shanghai's studio.[4] On August 2009, various screenshots of an old build of the game were leaked onto the Internet. [5] The most recent date released by Ubisoft is set between Q2 April 2010- Q2 March 2011. These dates have since passed and there has been no new news from the developers. However, in June 2011 a notification was published at the Australian classification website which might indicate a release in the late summer of 2011[6]. Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot said at the start of 2010 that the studio was ""totally re-engineering the product.""[7] Elias Toufexis (who voices Adam Jensen in Deus Ex Human Revolution and Andriy Kobin in Splinter Cell Conviction) has a major role in this game. Ubisoft recently cancelled a number of games, but it was revealed that I Am Alive and another Ubisoft title Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 were not among them, with Ubisoft simply stating that the cancelled games were unannounced games.

Bear in mind, though, the waterproof element will only last for 30 minutes to a depth of 1m, so keeping this phone could be a lot like keeping a gremlin.Sony Xperia™ active is water and dust resistant to handle whatever comes its way. Rough conditions? Rainy hike? The display is scratch resistant and lets you scroll even when your fingers are wet. The phone comes with a gear kit and is preloaded with sports apps so you can plan, monitor and log your training – from your sofa or the slopes.The Active is an interesting phone. It is dustproof and waterproof. It is powered by a 1GHz processor and runs on Android Gingerbread. The display is scratch resistant.It sports a 5MP camera. Looks like this phone is targeted at athletes as it comes with GPS , Barometer , wrist strap and arm band.

t5_2qjvn,Sommiel,1309391335,"Time for the ""hard word™"" from me. Know that I do not intend to be mean, but I am going to tell you the truth and parts of it won't be pretty.   &gt;He is not in love with me. I mean it. He's dated other people the whole time we've been friends.  And they were Plan B. Apparently you don't read this subreddit much, but this shit can go on for *years.* You are in denial. He is probably posting here under a throwaway complaining about how he can't have a successful relationship because he is in love with his ""best friend,"" who is dating a shithead druggie that isn't good enough for her.   **Here is where the rubber hits the road:**  Your boyfriend saw the problem, dealt with the problem and cowboyed up to try to make amends. This shows enormous strength of character. This is a person of integrity. He has put up with *your* friend treating him like shit, because *your* feelings are *his* priority.  This guy is a prince and honestly, you are not showing yourself to be particularly worthy of his loyalty to you.   This *so called* friend... does he talk about your boyfriend to you behind his back? I am sure he does. Do you stand there and listen to it or try to argue with him about it? He is gossiping with others about it? Is he a hypocrite? So yeah, he is an immature, manipulative, hypocritical, whiny little bitch.  I would not doubt that he is also telling your friends that you are an idiot to be dating and trusting him, behind your back. People never just talk behind one person's back, it's a serious character flaw and it tends to be ""just how they are.""   Now, you claim that he is your *best friend.* Doesn't even seem like a friend to me, because he is only a friend to you on his terms. He has shown no honor or integrity. He does nothing to deserve the title of *friend* let alone the honor of *best friend.* Yet still you think he is your BFF. You are deluded. More to the point you are terrified of making a stand because you don't want to muddy the water or make *your* social life uncomfortable. When it already is, because you are not maintaining a healthy boundary regarding what behavior you find acceptable in a friend.   However, your lack of boundary is truly deplorable, because while it might make your life difficult to put up with your ""friend,"" it's making your boyfriend's life hell. He has to interface with people that have heard before he arrives what an incredible piece of shit he is. He has to see his beloved girlfriend take off to hang out with someone knowing that she will be hearing nothing but negativity from this person. And he does it because he cares about your feelings and is willing to put them over his own.   You need to learn what loyalty is. You need to have clear in your mind, who your priority should be and exactly why they are worthy of your loyalty. And you need to hold on to that and protect it.  I will tell you exactly what I told your boyfriend:  If any of my friends ever behaved rudely to towards my SO, or talked behind my back about him to anyone else... they would never, ever be my friend again. He is my priority.   There is no way in *hell* that I would put up with listening to anything anyone had to say that was negative about my guy. I would turn around and walk away immediately and would never bother with them again.    He has earned every ounce of love and loyalty that I have for him. He deserves everything that is good and honorable. He comes first.   Time for you to sit down and do some serious thinking about what you are saying to your boyfriend (who doesn't seek to control your behavior in any way) by your own actions. Talk is cheap. You can say ""I love you"" 400 times a day, and it means nothing. Love is a verb. You have to demonstrate love with action. ",™

t5_2r2jt,dearjack,1309411749,"Well, I looked it up on their website and got this.. Will AZO STANDARD® and AZO STANDARD® Maximum Strength cure my UTI? No, AZO STANDARD® and AZO STANDARD® Maximum Strength are not antibiotics. The only clinically proven cure for a UTI is a prescription antibiotic.  So I guess not... ignore that suggestion! Although, originally (before being diagnosed), I thought I had a UTI and Azo REALLY helped the symptoms. I practically lived on that stuff. Unfortunately I don't know how to cure it because what I have isn't curable, so I just look to ease the pain!  For baking soda, I think you should really give it a shot. I've read that baking soda balances the acid, which is irritating the bladder. It kind of works as a neutralizer. I'm unsure as to whether or not this will help for you because what we have is different, but when I thought I had a UTI is when the baking soda idea came up. ",®
