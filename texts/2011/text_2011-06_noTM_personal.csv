t5_2qhnf,athanathios,1306933923,"Well I have 3 factors that are influencing me:  1) Strong desire to purify my mind. In my past, I have experienced various stages of insight, without a more formal meditation plan (although I know I was mediating in a different way than sitting). As I focused my energy (too wholeheartedly) in my career, some of my previous experiences got muddled with programs and attachments. So I have a desire, through first hand experience to purify my mind. So this motivation is important and keeps me on track and to see where my practice takes me.  2) Having only formally meditated for about 1.5 months so far, I can tell you that in and of itself, meditation has allowed me to (A) become more focused, (B) More mindful, © more at peace and calmer in general as well as other benefits. That's keeping me motivated.  3) Just keeping at it, consistency is key. I meditate at roughly the same time everyday, if I can't do it, I try to at least squeek in 10 minutes, this is usually a good way to keep on track.  Basically the more positive association you have with something, the more likely you will keep with it. The opposite is true with bad habits, I quit smoking for instance by focusing on all the negatives associated with it, in almost mantra like thinking.",84842,15827,0,0,0,1,©

Even though it is the first one there are at least 2 others related to gaming in the top 10 for me which could seem equally correct to a newcomer.  I just think we as a community should try to be more noob accommodating especially when it comes to lingo.  The immense learning curve kept me out of BW for a really long time and with the rise of eSports I would really like to see us as a community work together to be more beginner friendly.

Now, suppose you have two very closely related parents:  Mom:     -----☹--------------     ------------☹-------  Dad:     -----☹--------------     ------------☹-------  Then, if they have children, the children will each get one of those lines (one set of chromosomes) from each parent.

t5_2qh2a,ezraekman,1306996378,"This is such bad business advice I don't even know where to begin.  Free = a watermarked image.  Period.  If they pay (I charge $10/image for low-res and $50/image for high-res), I'll remove the watermark.  I usually don't give away images at all unless it's strictly for personal use.  (i.e. Facebook profile photos, sending to friends/family, etc.)  And ""bands don't have any money"" is BS.  They have expensive gear.  They printed flyers.  They built a web site.  They paid for it all somehow.  Maybe they don't have three grand to hire three photographers and rent a bunch of custom lighting.  But they can afford $10/image.  Now, if you're BRAND SPANKING NEW on the scene, sure.  Give away a few photos.  Specify your terms carefully: no commercial use whatsoever except promotion on their web site and in social networks.  If they want more, they can pay a measly $10 per photo and drink a little less beer on their next gig.  Otherwise, give them 800x600 (or 900x600 for a more proportionally accurate un-cropped image).  I had a small band (one of two opening bands for the headliner) contact me just last week, wanting to license several of the photos I shot.  They can come up with $50-100 (or whatever) to license a few good quality photos of themselves playing live, because they know just how much of a benefit it is to be able to demonstrate how cool they look on stage, or what their stage presence is like, or what kind of performers they are, etc.  (i.e. how many fans/drinkers will they bring into a bar, hence making them a more attractive booking option for a venue's marketing or booking agent.)  So, yeah; they can come up with a few bucks to license a few photos.  It ain't a lot, ya know?  Yes, watermark your photos.  Copyright law is explicit: you must identify your work for your protection.  You can legally do this with metadata, but a watermark is harder to argue with; it's clear and obvious.  Include a (SMALL, i.e. 5-10% of the total image size, MAXIMUM) watermark in the photo in the lower left/right corner.  Make sure the watermark includes ""© Your Name"", and a link to your web site if you have one.  No, Flickr/Facebook is not a website.  YourName.SomeoneElsesCompany.com is not a website.  YourNamePhotography.com is a website.  Be professional, and make sure it's easy for people to find/contact you.  For what it's worth, I shoot 1-5 events per week, and I've never gotten a single referral from a photo credit.  Generally, it's either word of mouth, or more often, handing someone a business card at an event I'm shooting for someone else.  So get some business cards ASAP.  [Vistaprint](http://www.vistaprint.com/) gives away 250 cheap cards, though you can also order 5,000 full-color, double-sided professional business cards for under $100 from [OvernightPrints.com](http://www.overnightprints.com/).  After you have a solid design you're happy with, I'd recommend doing that, then hand them out like crazy.  If you're thinking twice about handing out a business card to someone (unless they give you a bad vibe or something), you don't have enough business cards.  Re: RAW files, **never, ever, EVER give away your RAW files to ANYONE, EVER!**  They are your data, not the finished image.  High-res JPEG or TIFF files, fine.  But whoever has the RAW file can claim ownership of the image.  Also, most people simply don't have the knowledge or the right software to open RAW files.  Everyone can open a JPEG.  Give away watermarked low-res JPGs (optimized for decent quality and small file size, as they'll be used on the web), sell them high-res JPGs (or give them away, if you're so inclined), and keep your RAW files.  The only exception I will ever make to this rule is if they pay a *serious premium* for the files, or if it's ""work for hire"" through an employer... but I've been shooting for 10 years, all while gainfully employed, and have never had to give up the RAW files, or even the copyright, since I specified ahead of time that I owned my own images.  (Note: make sure you do this as well - if you don't, and you're shooting on company time or using company property, as an employee, your work belongs to them unless you agree otherwise in writing!)  Also, if your pick is 30 photos, don't give them 30 photos.  Give them 10-15 if the ""best of the best"", so to speak.  Then you've got 1-2 times as many photos to give them as well, if they want to see more.  As you shoot more events, you'll discover that you're taking more photos, and will have a larger pool to draw from.  When my clients hire me to shoot, I'll generally shoot 1-3K shots in a 2-3 hour event, and end up with 60-150 final photos after 3-4 rounds of cuts.  (1st round cuts anything with obvious flaws: focus/blur, exposure issues, distracting FG/BG objects, etc.  2nd round cuts anything boring.  3rd round cuts anything not awesome/exciting/happy/etc.  4th round cuts the shots I'm the least excited about if I'm still having trouble bringing the numbers down.)

t5_2qhc8,Mikul,1307113644,"So, the hex-site is a ghost ring with angles?  The claim is that it promotes target-focused shooting, but you still have to center that front post in the hex which is going to require shifting your focus. Now that the rear notch is gone, it's become more difficult to center the front post because there's so much room around the rear sight. Red dot sights and lasers are the only sights that don't have this issue.  I've done quite a bit of night shooting and if you're not using illuminated sights and you're beyond the distance where you can point shoot, you're missing. Police and military seem to agree. Your limbic brain doesn't see any better with a huge hexagon blocking your vision.  &gt;HexSite® is the only shotgun sighting system that offers the shooter slug accuracy on head shots at 75 yards, and calibrates the shot pattern automatically from 10 yards (nine-inch pattern) to 75 yards.

Unfortunately, it might take a *lot* of time, so you have to prepare yourself for that. Four years is a long time, it might take you many months (or even years) to get over it entirely.  By all means, sit at home and cry and drink and get it out of your system: you're more than entitled to do that. When you're done, get ready to put yourself to work. When my long-term relationship ended, what helped me most was staying active. I'm not the partying/clubbing/bar-hopping type, and I live pretty far away from friends, so I couldn't hang out, but I kept busy.

Additionally, I didn't read anything like that in the Ars liveblog.  From the press release:  &gt; Pricing &amp; Availability Mac OS X Lion will be available in July as an upgrade to Mac OS X version 10.6 Snow Leopard® from the Mac App Store for $29.99 (US). Lion will be the easiest OS X upgrade and at about 4GB, it is the size of an HD movie from the iTunes Store®.  &gt; [...]  &gt; Lion requires an Intel-based Mac with a Core 2 Duo, i3, i5, i7 or Xeon processor and 2GB of RAM. The Lion upgrade can be installed on all your authorized personal Macs.  If I can recall correctly, the comment about reboots was in a list of other things that are a problem with optical media OS upgrades. Then, Phil Schiller (?) says ""No more"" as in ""No more optical media.""  I can't even install Snow Leopard point updates without rebooting. I sincerely doubt Lion can be installed on top of Snow Leopard without a reboot.  If it is true that Lion can install without a reboot, I will have to see and hear someone say it in the Keynote with my own eyes and ears.  **Edit**:  I just watched the keynote on apple.com, and Phil Schiller says ""Installs right in place; you don't need to reboot *from an optical disk*.""

t5_2rnve,lurker818,1307393113,"You seem to not understand so I will try to put it a different way.       Why would you build a system with sub-par parts when you can buy the same system off-lease for about half the price of putting it together yourself. Please remember we are not talking about using salvaged or used parts. You are actually telling people to go buy brand new obsolete crap.   If someone asked for suggestions for a cheep computer to play sc2 on I would not advise them to build one. I would tell them to either get a good computer that is used or set your sites higher.            Think of it this way. What is the MINIMUM you expect to be able to purchase a case, motherboard, ps, ram, HDD, and cpu for?      Well, at tigerdirect.ca (for example) the cheapest of each is:      * CASE: Apex PC-389 ATX Black Mid Tower Case @ $34.99 * MOBO: 	MSI K9N6PGM2-V2 Motherboard - NVIDIA® @ $45.99 * PS: DiabloTek PSDA250 250-Watt Power Supply - ATX @ $12.99 * RAM: Kingston 1024MB PC5300 DDR2 667MHz Memory @$17.97 * HDD: Seagate ST3500413AS Barracuda Hard Drive - 500GB @ $39.97 * CPU: AMD Athlon X2 7850 Black Edition Dual Core Processor AD785ZWCJ2BGH @ $49.97      So if you were to purchase this computer from Tigerdirect it would cost you $201.88 and you would have the absolute worst computer that can be made using the parts available at Tigerdirect.ca       Now, for an extra $35 you can buy this bare-bones system:  ZOTAC GF6100-E-E nForce 4 Barebones Kit - ZOTAC GF6100-E-E Mini ITX Board, AMD Athlon X2 7850 BE CPU, CPU Cooler, Patriot 4GB (2x 2GB) DDR2 RAM, Seagate 500GB HDD, DVDRW, Diablotek Mid Tower, 400W PSU      You may notice things like twice the RAM, extra 150 watts on the PS and a DVD-RW drive.       Conclusion: It's cheaper to get the bare minimum system but its way better to get a kit as it is only marginally more expensive but some of the parts are way better.       $400 is not a cheap SC2 build, it's mid-range. If you are incapable of understanding the OP's request then you are not the type of person to be giving out advice. ",9677,195,0,0,1,1,®

Speaking at the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Technology Conference, Sanjay Jha, who heads up Motorola Mobility, said that the lack of quality control in the Android Marketplace was behind the high number of handset returns – along with the multitasking nature of Android, which permits background apps to eat into the battery and processor time.  ""Anyone can put an application on the Android Marketplace ... without any testing process,"" Jha told delegates, explaining that the ability to multitask is a blessing and a curse. ""Seventy per cent of devices are coming back because they have downloaded a third-party application, and the effect that has on performance.""  During the presentation, which was staged as an interview and is available on the conference site, Jha also spoke extensively about Motoblur. Motoblur is often seen as a simple UI skin for Android, but is really about customer ownership and identity aggregation.  Motorola would like its users to consider themselves customers of Motorola, rather than customers of their mobile network operator, or Google, and so it is pleased to have 10 million subscribers signed in with Motoblur, and has plans to increase that number significantly.  As well as hooking customers, Jha talks about Motoblur being able to help manage third-party apps by warning the user when something is consuming excessive power or processor cycles, but the company told Fierce Wireless that its current approach was based on better developer support though its Motodev programme. ®  Agile Project Management tool.

t5_2qob4,isosafrole,1307581330,"It is certainly provocative. This is why I added “(Alternet)” to the post title, as Alternet isn't exactly known for holding its punches. I felt that as clonazepam is becoming such a controversial drug—and I have to say that I agree with some of the concerns about the ubiquity of benzodiazepine prescribing in the USA—it was worth posting. After all, some patients will be reading the article and may turn up in a clinic extremely worried.  It's odd. In the USA, the prescribing rate of benzodiazepines and opioids is extremely high. In the UK, people who are deserving of benzodiazepines or opioid treatment—and who would benefit greatly—have great trouble in obtaining prescriptions. Though benzodiazepines have a great addiction/tolerance potential, they also have a surprisingly high therapeutic index. Some people can take the same dose for many months, or even years, without any obvious tolerance, though dependence is common. The question is; if they are benefiting from the drug, showing no signs of increasing the dose or asking for excessive repeat prescriptions, but could be said to be dependent, is the prescription inappropriate?  We have patients who have been on a stable dose of benzodiazepine for years being switched to second-generation neuroleptics such as quetiapine (Seroquel®) and risperidone (Risperdal®)—drugs with a far more damaging adverse effect profile, and then remaining on them for years, because the UK authorities imply that almost *any* prescribing of benzodiazepines is inappropriate.",2544,21668,0,0,1,1,®

[Um...](http://i.imgur.com/SGNLA.jpg)  Well, you see there's this thing called the Playstation store. It shows up as a blue shopping bag icon in your PS3's menu. (Actually, three times, in the Video, Game, and PlayStation® Network menus). You must have an account set up, but once you do, load up the PlayStation store. There will be a menu on the left hand side of your screen. Select ""Add-Ons"" from the menu, then ""disc based Add-Ons"", and the ""A-L Add-Ons"", then find the icon for F:NV. It should be somewhere around the 11th row of games. From there, you can select one of the available DLC packages. You can then go through the purchasing process (They are $9.99 a piece), then download the DLC. Once it has been downloaded, you will see an Icon in your game menu. (The menu on your PS3 OS, not the in-game menu). Select it and push the appropriate button to install it. Once it is installed, fire up your game and you will have access to the DLC content. After about 15-30 seconds of game time, you will get an in-game notification and the intro quest for the DLC and a map marker will be added.",44484,2129,0,0,1,1,®

(Here's where I had to ask my Navy veteran husband about how that worked for him, he told me when you sign up you can specify certain fields you'd like to work in or you can choose to be ""undesignated"" if you're not sure about what you want to do.) That will work differently in different branches of the service, so check them all out thoroughly. Talk to any veterans you know who have been in the military in the last few years, plus I am sure there are subreddits for discussions about it too. ➡**HUGELY IMPORTANT THING: If any recruiter you talk to promises you something you want, GET IT IN WRITING!** The ""Cover Your Ass"" principle is something you must remember.  -You get great benefits in the service. Health insurance. Housing assistance. The GI bill. A VA loan if you want to buy a house. Preferential hiring benefits in civilian jobs, such as the Postal service, police and fire departments and a lot of private companies too. For example, my husband started working for PetSmart 6 months after I did but he started out making more than me because he is a veteran. Even though he is not a manager he makes almost as much as they do because of their policy of paying veterans more.

t5_2qm4e,inquilinekea,1307913924,"It's hard to definitively say at this moment. The early sun was much dimmer than it is now, which means that Mars had to have HUGE amounts of CO2 to obtain a greenhouse effect significant enough to offset its increased distance from the Sun - but this would be hard for a planet whose mass was so small. Early on, it may also have retained some energy from accretional and radioactive processes (at had a magma ocean for the first billion years of its life). But accretional/radioactive heat would be more evenly distributed throughout the Martian atmosphere, rather than localized to equatorial regions (much like solar heat is)  In any case, here's one good paper:* Forget F, Pierrehumbert RT. 1997. Warming early Mars with carbon dioxide clouds that scatter infrared radiation. Science 278: 1273–76 [CrossRef] [Web of Science ®] [ADS]*  Here's another good quote I got from a paper (http://www.annualreviews.org/eprint/i86y2DeTuaEFxeFyIJXu/full/10.1146/annurev-earth-040809-152447):  &gt;As noted by Walker (2001), the seasonal cycle is rather like that of Mars, which also has a global solid surface. The Martian analog is strengthened by the fact that the solar radiation absorbed by the high-albedo Snowball Earth, per unit surface area, is comparable to the solar radiation that the non-Snowball Mars absorbs in its more distant orbit. The Neoproterozoic solar forcing of the Snowball is 128 W m−2 if the albedo is 60%, or 96 W m−2 if the albedo is 70%; this compares with 110 W m−2 for present Mars or approximately 77 W m−2 for the Mars of 4 billion years ago. Furthermore, at the low temperatures of Snowball Earth and Mars, the water vapor content of the atmosphere is so low that neither the water vapor greenhouse effect nor the latent heat of water vapor condensation has any significant influence on the climate. The Snowball climate differs from present Mars, however, in that Earth's atmosphere is thicker, providing enough thermal inertia to damp the diurnal cycle significantly; in this regard, Snowball Earth is more like an early Mars with a dense atmosphere. A further difference is that Earth is a larger planet. Given the same rotation rate, this means that Earth's Hadley cell is more confined to the tropics, whereas that of Mars has a more global character—all other things being equal, a larger planet acts dynamically like a more rapidly rotating planet of lesser diameter (Caballero et al. 2008). &gt;  If you want some more good papers...  http://www3.geosc.psu.edu/~jfk4/PersonalPage/PDFs.htm  http://faculty.washington.edu/dcatling/publications.html",1982,6715,0,0,1,1,®

Actually, this orange maze is a graph of sorts. This chapter emphasizes graphs. As you will learn, a graph is a picture of an equation. You will begin with equations that describe straight lines rather than the complex shapes that you see here.  Graphs and linear functions are useful tools for describing relationships or concepts. For example, a linear function such as *y* = 0.25*x* can describe the number of people (*y*) who will accept Christ after *x* hours of witnessing. According to the relationship represented by this function, a person will see only one soul saved for every four hours he spends sharing the gospel. He cannot expect more. (In practice, though not in this function, he might actually see fewer saved.)  As a Christian, you know that it was God who worked in your heart and brought you to a saving knowledge of Him. Your salvation was not based on a ""linear relationship"" in which you did something for God and He in turn did something for you. You gave nothing, but he gave everything. This same principle applies to your service. What is accomplished in the lives of others is not a result of your witness, but of God's working.

In a revelation that is stirring anger on Capitol Hill and among Iraqi officials in Baghdad, the office that was created by the Bush administration to monitor efforts to get Iraq on its feet after the 2003 invasion is saying that $6.6bn (€4.6bn) all delivered in cash, cannot be accounted for.  Just how much of the missing money was pocketed either by US contractors or Iraqis is not clear, nor is it likely that a full picture of what happened will ever be painted. Even so, Stuart Bowen, who runs the monitoring office, said that the errant billions may represent the ""largest theft of funds in national history"".  Controls  What does seem clear is that, in its rush to get cash into Iraq to help persuade the population that economic and social order could be re-established quickly, the US did not ensure the proper level of financial controls. The US was sending C-130 Hercules transport planes loaded with $100 bills.  The money was mostly drawn from Iraqi oil revenues and the UN Oil-for-Food fund. Consequently, the Iraqi government may demand that Washington compensate the country for the missing money.  ""Iraq has an interest in looking after its assets,"" said Samir Sumaidaie, Iraq's ambassador to the US. That will not be well received by the US Congress, however, which has seen more than $60bn spent on Iraqi reconstruction. ""Congress is not looking forward to having to spend billions of our money to make up for billions of their money that we can't account for,"" noted Congressman Henry Waxman.

t5_2qm06,arsenic_lifeform_4u,1308204199," Suman 30 muertos por ola violenta en NL Por EL NORTE / Staff Monterrey,  México (15 junio 2011).-   La escalada de violencia en el Estado superó hoy el récord del año al registrarse 30 muertes relacionadas con el crimen organizado en un día.  En distintos hechos delictivos, autoridades reportaron 14 muertes en Monterrey, 6 en Guadalupe, 5 en Pesquería, 3 en Cadereyta, 1 en Santa Catarina y otra en San Pedro.  El pasado 20 de mayo Nuevo León tuvo su jornada más violenta al sumar 18 muertos también, 14 de ellos reportados fallecidos en un incendio en el Cereso de Apodaca y otros 4 en ejecuciones ligadas a la delincuencia organizada.  Hoy, en el hecho más reciente, al menos 7 muertos se registraron en un lapso de 20 minutos en calles de la Colonia Moderna.  Los cuerpos de auxilio recibieron el reporte de personas sin vida y heridas a las 22:00 horas.  Los socorristas encontraron a un hombre ejecutado, a un lado de un auto Jetta Blanco, en el cruce de Peral e Independencia.  Después, tras escucharse unas detonaciones, otras tres personas abatidas a balazos fueron localizadas en el cruce de Laurel e Independencia.  En ese lugar, los paramédicos auxiliaron a otra personas herida gravemente.  En el cruce de Granados y Gardenia también fueron ubicadas otras tres personas sin vida.  Trascendió que en el cruce de Mirto y Naranjo habría otras tres personas sin vida, pero esto no ha sido confirmado.  Ejecutan a mujer en García  El cuerpo de una mujer de entre 30 o 35 años fue localizado abandonado a la orilla de los carriles hacia el poniente del Libramiento Noroeste, a la altura del Bulevar Luis Donaldo Colosio, en García.  Extraoficialmente la Policía Ministerial asegura que testigos señalaron haber visto que, alrededor de las 23:00 horas, la camioneta Explorer, la cual era conducida por la mujer, fue interceptada por grupo de delincuentes.  Cuando los hombres intentaron despojarla de su vehículo, la mujer opuso resistencia, por lo que le dispararon, dejando el cadáver en el lugar.  Presuntamente los delincuentes se llevaron la camioneta con dos menores en su interior, uno de 4 y otro de 6 años, pero esto no ha sido confirmado por las autoridades.  Tiran en el Centro a 3 mutilados  Tres cuerpos descuartizados fueron encontrados sobre la vía pública en donde fueron regados por hombres armados que viajaban en varias camionetas, en el Centro de la Ciudad.  Los cuerpos desmembrados se encontraban sobre la calle Artículo 123 entre Calzada Madero y la Avenida Colón.  Antes de darse a la fuga, los delincuentes realizaron disparos al aire para alertar a la Policía.  Junto a los cuerpos descuartizados los delincuentes dejaron dos narcomensajes dirigidos a un grupo rival del crimen organizado, pero no se reveló su contenido exacto.  Peritos de la Procuraduría de Justicia estatal se encuentran recabando evidencia en la escena del crimen.  Dejan a 3 ejecutados en Guadalupe  Tres hombres fueron encontrados ejecutados a balazos y esposados en el interior de una camioneta, en el Fraccionamiento Nueva Joya, en Guadalupe.  El reporte del hallazgo se realizó alrededor de las 21:00 horas en el cruce de la Avenida Plutarco Elías Calles y la calle México, a donde se movilizaron los diferentes cuerpos policiacos para realizar las investigaciones.  Una fuente señaló que dos de los occisos estaban en la cajuela de una camioneta XTrail plateada, mientras que el otro fue hallado en el asiento trasero.  El informante indicó que los tres cuerpos presentan impactos de bala, que están esposados con las manos por la espalda y encintados de las piernas.  Aparentemente, por el estado en el que fueron encontrados los cadáveres, las autoridades establecieron que éstos fueron dejados por la mañana, después de que los asesinaron en otro lugar.  La fuente dijo que ni dentro de la camioneta ni en el pavimento fueron encontrados casquillos de bala, y que no fue localizado ningún narcomensaje.  Hallan a 3 ejecutados en la Col. Florida  Vecinos reportaron el hallazgo de tres hombres ejecutados en la Colonia Florida.  Los hechos fueron reportados alrededor de las 17:00 horas en la calle Anastasio Parrodi y Aquiles Serdán.  En el lugar, de acuerdo con vecinos, se escucharon detonaciones de arma de fuego por lo que se presume que los delincuentes primero ejecutaron a las víctimas y posteriormente les intentaron prender fuego.  En una pared los delincuentes dejaron un narcomensaje pintado con aerosol que decía: ""Estos son Z. Att. CDG. Saludos. Jo..."".  Descuartizan a 3 custodios en Cadereyta  Por la mañana, poco antes de las 7:00 horas, los cuerpos de tres celadores del Penal de Cadereyta que hace dos días habían sido levantados fueron dejados descuartizados a las puertas del reclusorio.  De acuerdo con los primeros informes, los cuerpos de los celadores fueron dejados debajo de una palmera en el camellón central de la carretera que pasa frente al Penal, al parecer por un grupo de hombres que viajaba en varios vehículos.  Hallan a mujer sin vida en San Jerónimo  El hallazgo de un cuerpo sin vida movilizó a las autoridades policiacas, en el sector de San Jerónimo.  El hallazgo fue reportado por una llamada anónima alrededor de las 7:00 horas en el cruce de San Jerónimo y J. Luna Ayala, a espaldas del Colegio Mexicano.  Al llegar al lugar, las autoridades encontraron el cuerpo sin vida de una mujer que no tenía la cabeza, estaba amarrada de las manos por la parte delantera y en el pecho tenía una cartulina con un mensaje, del cual no se informó su contenido.  Descuartizan a escoltas de Medina  A las 7:40, los cuerpos de los dos hombres hallados descuartizados y envueltos en costales en la avenida Chapultepec y Arteaga, en Guadalupe, fueron identificados como escoltas del Gobernador Rodrigo Medina.  Los restos de los integrantes del Grupo SWAT, que sólo fueron identificados por sus apodos como ""El Chivo"" y ""El Negro"", fueron dejados en costales y una cubeta, alrededor de las 7:40 horas, frente a un centro comercial HEB.  Una fuente de la Policía Ministerial reveló que con los cuerpos fue dejado un narcomensaje dirigido al Gobernador. El contenido del mensaje fue confirmado por otras fuentes oficiales.  Mueren 5 en tiroteo en Pesquería  Un enfrentamiento entre militares e integrantes de la delincuencia organizada dejó como saldo cinco presuntos delincuentes muertos, tres detenidos y tres personas liberadas que se encontraban plagiadas.  Los hechos se registraron alrededor de las 10:15 horas en un área baldía que está entre la calle Agualeguas, que está sin pavimentar, y el Arroyo Los Piojos, en la Colonia Jesús María, en Pesquería.  Hallan a ejecutado en Guadalupe  Un hombre fue encontrado sin vida maniatado y con impactos de bala en el pecho, en un lote baldío de la Col. Dos Ríos.  Los hechos fueron reportados a las 7:40 horas en la avenida Río Bravo y el Camino a las Escobas, informaron los puestos de emergencia.  De acuerdo con informes extraoficiales, fueron unas personas que pasaban por el lugar quienes reportaron los hechos, acudiendo hasta el lugar policías municipales, quienes confirmaron los hechos.  En el lugar, el hombre fue hallado con el torso desnudo, quien vestía solo un pantalón gris y estaba con sus manos amarradas por la espalda.  Lo hallan asesinado a golpes en Canteras  Un hombre fue encontrado asesinado presuntamente a golpes en lo alto del Cerro de la Loma Larga, en la Colonia Canteras, en San Pedro.  Una fuente de la Policía Ministerial reportó que a las 15:00 horas recibieron el reporte de detonaciones de arma de fuego en el citado cerro, y al acudir varios uniformados sampetrinos encontraron al occiso tirado boca abajo.  Según las primeras inspecciones realizadas por las autoridades al cadáver, éste presenta golpes y una herida en la cabeza, que no se ha determinado si también es una lesión por contusión o por un disparo.

t5_2qh63,tkwelge,1308439717,"Wait wait wait.  This article completely misses the point. It is merely a collection of straw man arguments, misrepresentations, and a complete befuddlement at what many libertarians are actually saying.  &gt;Let’s start by noting that I am not claiming any right at all. Protectionism, if implemented, wouldn’t be implemented by me. It would be implemented by the U.S. Government, and would be legitimate—if it is legitimate—for the same reasons all our other legitimate laws are legitimate:   Wow, laws are laws because it's the law!  &gt;Like it or not, even a capitalist economy is a system, in which your actions affect other people. Your freedom to swing your fist ends, famously, at the tip of my nose, and what you buy and don’t buy affects other people.  I like when people mention things like this as if no libertarian has really thought about it before.  These are the sort of issues that are discussed in libertarianism 101 for fuck's sake.  Libertarians don't define ""freedom"" as ""the ability to do anything that you want.""  Libertarians define freedom as a lack of the initiation of violence.  It is oxymoronic to argue that one could have the ""freedom"" to punch somebody else in the face, by the non aggression principle.     &gt;Even more importantly, your own economic actions don’t mean anything except in the context of a system that you didn’t create. You don’t enjoy the income you enjoy—which is what gives you the very ability to buy things disputed above—solely because of your own efforts. You enjoy that income because, among other things, you were born into a society which had a per-capita GDP of $47,000 during your working lifetime.   Ah!  The ""no man is an island"" straw man.  Any real libertarian is not making that argument.  Of course human beings cooperate and benefit from cooperation.  That's what markets are, cooperation!  Government bureaucracy is simply another form of cooperation, and not a superior one.   &gt;None of this is to deny that a reasonable amount of economic freedom is a good thing. But you get into trouble when you elevate it, like any other good, into an absolute. Try absolutizing national security, traditional values, law enforcement, self expression, religious piety, intellectual sophistication, social order, … Get my point?  Once again, have you ever even spoken to a libertarian?  Libertarianism is simply based on only one absolute.  That is the non aggression principle.  This author defines libertarianism with the help of the voices in his head, apparently.    &gt;The libertarian economic model is a model based on free markets. That is, it is based on the idea that free market economics describes both the way the economy is (insofar as it works well) and the way it should be.   There is no ""libertarian economic model"" in the sense that the author is speaking in.  Libertarianism is less interested in how the economy ""should be"" than it is interested in the non aggression of force.  Of course the free flow of ideas and goods is superior to the constricted trade of such things.  You are free to start a commune and implement any economic model that you can think of, but don't use violent force or theft to accomplish that goal.  &gt;The key idea of this free market economics is equilibrium. That is to say, free market economics holds that if market forces are allowed free play, then the prices and production of things will reach natural equilibria that are the most efficient outcome that could exist.  All markets reach equilibrium.  Again, you are making no sense.  Even a controlled market will reach an equilibrium, and the market will still reach a general equilibrium, it will just be different in certain ways.  There is no ""most efficient outcome that could exist.""  The economy is always in flux and needs to be able to make changes accordingly.  Controlling one aspect of the economy or another through force can interrupt this process.  There is no ""ideal"" equilibrium.  There are simply forced equilibrium levels and free equilibrium levels.    &gt;To a huge (but not total) extent, this is true. (I studied economics at the University of Chicago; trust me, I know this story.)  I'd get my money back.  &gt;But there’s a catch. Equilibria only balance properly if nobody puts a “thumb on the scale” anywhere in the economic system and distorts it.   Once again, the data is always in flux and the market is either responding to natural cooperation or the initiation of violent coercion.  The argument has nothing to do with ""Equilibria balancing properly.""  Government force is simply more data entering the system, data that is based on theft and violence.    &gt;All bets are also off—this is the key—about any individual “free” market decision being valid. Why? Because the market isn’t free anymore. You can’t play by free market rules when you’re not in a free market.   Wrong.  You are either initiating violence or theft or you aren't.  You can play by free market rules in an unfree environment. You simply have to put the guns down.  &gt;Try playing fair when the game is rigged. That’s not fairness, it’s suicide.  It's called ""not doubling down on corruption and evil.""  You're pitting countries against eachother, when it is only all of us vs the elite that seeks to control trade.  Let's look at who are real enemies are and do our best not to become them.  &gt;Whenever libertarians buy foreign goods that are cheaper because of all these practices, they encourage them.  Not necessarily.  The underlying economic effects of the policies that you mentioned are playing out negatively in the home countries that distort trade too.  Isolating countries doesn't seem to have a good track record of encouraging freedom either.  Iran is isolated.  North Korea is isolated.  Cuba is isolated.  Several dictatorships around the world are isolated, and that isolation empowers them further.  North Korea can call us the great satan and blame us for all of their problems along with Iran.  Innocent people starved and died due to economically isolating Iraq after the gulf war.    Responding to protectionism with protectionism simply makes all of us victims.  Other countries are not necessarily initiating violence against us when they sell us cheaper products, but we are certainly initiating violence against our own people by telling people what they can and cannot buy and who they can and cannot trade with.  Inevitably, protectionism leads to crony capitalism, and an escalation of global trade wars.  Protectionism will not lead to free markets or freedom in any way, shape, or form.    I'm sorry, but do you even truly understand what the libertarian argument against protectionism is?  &gt;© 2011 Copyright  Ian Fletcher - All Rights Reserved   Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!

t5_2qimj,stikeymo,1308482234,"This comes off the back of a highly dubious Sunday Times article, which is debunked fairly effectively on [Digital Spy](http://forums.digitalspy.co.uk/showthread.php?t=1465431&amp;page=110) (I found this linked to in the comments on the [F1 Fanatic](http://www.f1fanatic.co.uk/2011/06/19/sunday-times-claims-bbc-drop-f1-2013/) article).  **TLDR**: The story originated in a pro-Tory newspaper, the Sunday Times. Its F1 editor is openly wanting F1 to go to Sky. Hence, the article is best ignored as it is inaccurate throughout.    &gt;1) ""Its contract to screen F1 for five seasons until 2013 will cost £300m. - incorrect. It is well known that the contract costs BBC about £200m over 5 years, with the next contract increased to £235m. I guess that may factor in production costs, but as far as I know they are minimal and definitely would not amount to an extra £20m per year. &gt; &gt;2) ""At about £3m per race, it is the most expensive BBC programme being broadcast."" - incorrect. As the first point of £300m is wrong, the second point is also wrong. At 19 races, each race costs BBC about £2.1m. In my book, that is not £3m. The point ""it is the most expensive BBC programme being broadcast"" is factually incorrect. You cannot compare 5 hours of programming on BBC1 at £3m with a drama at 9pm on BBC1 which typically costs about £600,000. In fact, going on the £2.1m figure, F1 costs BBC about £420,000 per hour. I've even excluded things like the F1 Forum and Practice with that figure and all the other stuff they do, in reality the figure will be lower than that. Some dramas on BBC1 only get 4.5m viewers and cost £600,000, whereas with F1 you get you're hard to reach 16 to 34 audience, it doesn't cost much and you get at least 4.5m viewers on average per race. Everyone wins. &gt; &gt;3) ""An insider said the cost of covering 19 F1 races was more than the entire budget of BBC4."" - again depends on whether the £60m per year figure is correct, because its the first time I've seen it. BBC4 costs £55m per year, so if the £60m per year figure for F1 is wrong, then the entire article is spouted with inaccuracy and riddles. &gt; &gt;4) ""The source said the BBC did not intend to rebid for the F1 contract when it expired in November 2013."" - in which case, why did you have a scaremongering title saying 'BBC AXES FORMULA ONE'. Axes suggests you're terminating the contract early. No early termination is being seeked hear if you are to believe the article. Besides, they would not rebid for a contract an entire one and a half years before you would even begin discussing it. &gt; &gt;5) ""It has emerged that F1 costs £1 a head for every viewer, compared with the average 7p an hour broadcast cost for BBC1 and BBC2."" - http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/assets...rts_rights.pdf ; page 35 - Formula 1 2009 - hit in every category, only one of two events to do this. - as a said at the time (page 36) : ""[✂ Redacted] is the outstanding success, significantly exceeding all of its reach, average audience and cost per viewer hour targets"" - is almost certainly referring to F1 - hence this on Page 4: ""Formula 1 has been a significant success in 2009/10, exceeding all of its reach, average audience and cost per viewer hour target"" - report was done earlier this year into the process of acquiring sports rights - see page 33: ""Formula 1 and Premier League highlights attract a younger (16-34) male audience that is otherwise hard to reach...."" &gt; &gt;6) ""Apart from the British Grand Prix, most races attract between 2m and 4m viewers."" - http://forums.autosport.com/index.php?showtopic=112436 - enough said at this point - only one race has dipped under 4m, and that was because it was against a Ford Super Sunday triple header on Sky Sports &gt; &gt;7) ""It costs more for each hour than even the most expensive dramas such as South Riding, Cranford and Doctor Who."" - again, this depends on whether the £60m figure is actually true.

Don't even try to defend yourself. Just run.   2. Second worst is being ugly.  If you are ugly, you clearly have no business being alive.  So really, just get off Reddit, unless you post pictures of your boobies, then you can stay.  3. If you are fat or ugly, you probably need to trick a man into being interested into you.  This can be done in a variety of ways.  A. Lying B. Becoming Pregnant, or C. a combination of the two.  Males must be veeeerryy careful to avoid this, because we females can be veeeeeerrryyy sneaky.   4. If you are female, and have ever been in a serious relationship, which you are now not in, it’s probably your fault because “**you’re crazy.**”  You should change yourself **immediately** if you have any hope of attracting your dream man... a fat nerd.  5. You must be pretty.  Not in a made-up way.  You must actually have hit the genetic lottery and be flawless without make-up.  For this you will receive endless vulgar compliments. You're welcome.  6. The fact that you're a PRETTY WOMAN must come up ""accidentally.""  Explaining that you are female, or posting a picture in which it is clear that you are both female and attractive will knock you back to ""fat chick"" status. *Note female beauty may incite anger in some regardless of your adherence to the rules, and you will probably be called a “cum slut” or something similar by somebody, don’t take it personally, this means they like you! (it’s like kindergarten, don’t question it).  7. If you are Natalie Portman or Zooey Deschanel, then you have been jizzed on by much of Reddit, many, many times... ladies... attempt to look like these woman, but not TOO hard... because you know... you have to be beautiful without trying... it’s confusing... I know, because these photoshopped pictures are anything but “natural.”  8. You must only praise males.  Otherwise they will become angered and you will, again, be knocked back to ""fat chick"" status.  They become less angered if they think you are male, you may use this strategy.  9. You are a sex object. Start acting like it.  This means only making your opinion known when appropriate.  Again, pretending to be male may allow you to inject your male-disguised wisdom into a thread, and may even result in a ""totally bro.""  10. When men don't want sex, they are very hungry, you should probably use your diminished mental capacity to just make them a sandwich.  Isn't it better when we just pretend that feminism means females are allowed to show their boobies in public? ",91,1,0,0,1,1,®

Q &amp; A, as it is known to any who entered a coma state in 2005 and are emerging today, was created on July 5th 2005. Intended as a vehicle for hive mind knowledge sharing and collective enlightenment, Yahoo!® Answers instead serves as an eidetic drool rag of the bottom rung of human efforts in communication.  To capture salient characteristics of the remarkable works of ignorance found on Yahoo! Answers and distill their essence, I employed a variety of literary techniques. A lack of capitalization and punctuation, casual attention to spelling, and poor, often redundant word choice set the tone. Jilted, agrammatical phrasing suggests confusion during the formative moments of the question, decoupled from any revision of the asker's final thought, which may have been marginally more cogent than what is presented to the reader. Explicitly requesting an affirmative or negative response serves as a preliminary bit of chaff and doubles as a way of informing the askee of the difficulty on the part of the asker in interpreting the contextual implications communicated in the leading stanza of the run-on statement. To maximize the degree of obfuscation of the primary interrogative, entirely irrelevant details about the individual's particular purchase are presented in a manner that highlights their perceived importance. This second wave of chaff, no more grammatically sound than the central question, encourages repeated readings via its misleading effect of distraction. ",30772,2037,0,0,1,1,®

t5_2qh2p,TheFlyingBastard,1308823387,"&gt; We haven't really addressed why God isn't necessarily a master to those who believe in him, beyond the illusions of free will.   I mentioned the Jews being polytheists earlier. Besides, the bible does say in 2 Corinthians 4:4 that Satan is the god of this world. Sure, they would be a master to his supposed worshipers, but though the True Christian® would see him as a god, not as their master.  &gt; This is also forgetting the point that the whole meme is meant only to show what God cared more about righteousness vs the ""HEY worship me!"" sentiment  Hence my comment. That point didn't really come through very well in this picture. It'd be better to use a different example, I feel, as the two ""masters"" are of an entirely different order.  &gt; But the question still stands, why would the religious tolerate a God that was cool with something inherently evil involving mastery and then piss over people accepting another leader over him--even ALONGSIDE him?  Probably because the bible says that all their leaders are appointed by God. Again, God is a whole new degree of master...ness...ship.

Years ago I enjoyed **NeverWinter Nights**, and the 2 expansion packs. I would think NWN2 is just as good, but I never checked. Speaking of which, I should probably go reinstall NWN!  I remember loving and enjoying **Ultima IV** on the Apple ][e, and was overjoyed when I saw [a remake](http://xu4.sourceforge.net/) being made. Then I read that the PC data files were freeware! Of course, that wasn't *exactly* [the case](http://gamepolitics.com/2011/03/29/ea-uses-dmca-takedown-ultima-iv-downloads), but there are 2 individuals who still have permission to share the Ultima4 files. You can also apparently download the [full Ultima IV from EA as well](http://www.ultimaforever.com/index.php) (they say you'll need DosBox, but if you use the updated engine (xu4) above, it'll run straight from Windows).

That it is a support group for people who are having problems with alcohol, and a safe place to go to get emotional help.  That it's nice to have support and rapport with people who are going through the same problems that they are, religious or not.  Is AA a perfect organization?  No.  Is it going to help everyone?  No.  CAN it help someone?  Maybe.  This organization exists to help people.  Maybe the organization itself has roots in Christianity, but *fuck you* for discounting that help because of that.  That's like telling someone not to seek safety in a bomb shelter because it was built by religious folk.  AA is there to help people, regardless of denomination *or anything else*, and it even says so in their mission.  **(Alcoholics Anonymous® is a fellowship of men and women who share their experience, strength and hope with each other that they may solve their common problem and help others to recover from alcoholism.

AA is not allied with any sect, denomination, politics, organization or institution; does not wish to engage in any controversy, neither endorses nor opposes any causes. Our primary purpose is to stay sober and help other alcoholics to achieve sobriety.)**   To the OP?  Seek help.  Seek help in lots of places.  Take the suggestions that the people on this thread are giving you.  Go to AA.  Exercise.  Find like-minded friends.  And if what you're doing doesn't help?  Then don't do it anymore.  Move on.

I never claimed to do so. I was just observing that you can stop maintaining solar energy (due to budget cuts or whatever) and the worst that can happen is it'll stop producing power. In the case of a nuclear power station the consequences of negligence are much more severe.*",219203,20666,0,0,1,1,😉

t5_2qh55,hosty,1309286055,"From the [Sucralose FAQ](http://www.splenda.com/faq/no-calorie-sweetener):  &gt;Sucralose, the no-calorie sweetening ingredient in SPLENDA® No &gt;Calorie Sweetener, is about 600 times sweeter than sugar. Like other &gt;tabletop sweeteners, the granulated and packet products contain &gt;small amounts of carbohydrate (less than 1 gram per serving) for &gt;consistent sweetening and to provide volume. These bulking &gt;ingredients are dextrose (packets) and maltodextrin (packets and &gt;granulated). However, the bulking ingredients provide so few calories &gt;per serving that the FDA allows the SPLENDA® No Calorie Sweetener &gt;Products to be labeled no calorie sweeteners, because they provide &gt;less than five calories per serving.  Granted, they don't say exactly how much maltodextrin and dextrose are in a packet, but considering that a packet weighs 1g, the sucralose itself is around 600 times as sweet as sugar, and they aim for the 1g packet to taste like a packet of sugar (usually around 4g), you can expect it to have about 596/600 g of filler (99.3%). If you're diabetic and using a couple of packets in your coffee or something, it's not going to have a huge effect (no more than .993g of sugar would), and it's definitely better than using 4 times the amount of sugar. But if you start using a cup of splenda in baking or something, you're fooling yourself if you think it's sugar free or calorie free.  They do sell splenda in concentrated liquid form, where the only ingredients are sucralose and water. If you're actually concerned about your sugar intake, I'd go with this",6209,463,0,0,1,1,®

The meta-analysis corrected problems with a previously published meta-analysis and added more recent findings. **In contrast to the earlier meta-analysis, the current results showed an overall significant positive association between pornography use and attitudes supporting violence against women in nonexperimental studies.** In addition, such attitudes were found to correlate significantly higher with the use of sexually violent pornography than with the use of nonviolent pornography, although the latter relationship was also found to be significant. The study resolves what appeared to be a troubling discordance in the literature on pornography and aggressive attitudes by showing that the conclusions from nonexperimental studies in the area are in fact fully consistent with those of their counterpart experimental studies. This finding has important implications for the overall literature on pornography and aggression. Aggr. Behav. 36:14–20, 2010. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",1232,261,0,0,1,1,©
t5_2r4b9,patienceinbee,1309357265,"I have not quite found myself in an experience like this, so thank you for sharing what went down.  I have yet to navigate such direct proxy hostility.    The closest with which I've had to deal is when a reckless statement is made about a trans person. They're not malicious in tone like that gay guy you met — and yes, some gay guys I've met are aggressively invested in pointing out the ""tranny"" as being like them — that is, ♂, ♂, ♂ forever — or in merely de-legitimizing trans women's lives as fraudulent and ha-ha funny.    Most recently, I think it was the Chrissy Lee Polis beating which came up around company where I was not out.  I think someone mis-gendered her, and I said something like, ""I think if she wanted to be called a man or 'he', she would not have changed her name to Chrissy and she would live out her day to day life as a man, not as a woman.""  Others in the room agreed, and this person conceded that they had erred in their ignorant judgement. I did, however, qualify my statement as having met trans people in the past who made it clear that this is what they would say in the same situation.  I just didn't disclose that I was one of those trans people.  There is one guy in my extended social circle, though, I do worry about.  While we have a myriad of acquaintances in the same circles, he is an avowed transphobe as a white cis gay man who thinks that all trans people are A) ""MTF"" and B) ""transgenderists"".  I gather sometimes that his obsessive sense of awareness for trans people has been set off by my stepping up softly in such moments of correction and by the point that my narrative, personality, and my range of interests generally seem ""impossibly"" unlikely for a ""real woman"" or sslt.  So I must eye him like a hawk and keep him just beyond arm's reach.  My worry is that he'll run with an assumption, out me pre-emptively, and then force me into a corner to ""prove"" that his outing was — oops! — just an inaccurate presumption.  If he does this, then yes, I'll want to beat the tree out of him, but he holds powerful sway in the shared circles in which we run and he preceded my arrival to these circles.  I want to believe that the content of my contributions would trump this, but with him I doubt it.    Did I happen to mention he's a white, cis gay man in queer space and has great esteem by straight people and non-able-bodied people in the process (he works on accessibility services)?",12031,690,0,0,1,1,♂

t5_2qh03,ne1av1cr,1309358891," I Am Alive From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia For other uses, see I Am Alive (disambiguation). I Am Alive  Developer(s)	Darkworks (former) Ubisoft Shanghai Publisher(s)	Ubisoft Engine	LEAD Platform(s)	Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii Release date(s)	2011 Genre(s)	Action Mode(s)	Single-player Media/distribution	DVD, Blu-ray Disc I Am Alive is an upcoming action video game developed by Ubisoft Shanghai and published by Ubisoft. It will be released on the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Microsoft Windows and Wii. The game takes place in Chicago after a major-scale earthquake has destroyed the city and separated it from mainland, while the rest of the world suffers a water crisis.[1] Contents [hide] 1 Plot 2 Gameplay 3 Development 4 References 5 External links [edit]Plot  The game takes place in Chicago after a 10.3 Mw earthquake destroys the city and the rescue team fails to save the survivors. Millions are dead, and the city is leveled. The protagonist, a middle-class man named Adam Collins, has to evade enemies, keep from becoming dehydrated, find his missing girlfriend and stay alive in a crumbled city of hate.[2] Adam also has to evade certain citizens throughout the game, as they'll do anything in order to take his belongings, and use them as their own. [edit]Gameplay  The player controls Adam Collins in a first person perspective. The player can use various tactics to stay alive, including using an empty gun to threaten enemies, finding food and water around the city in order to keep Adam alive and healthy and use of actual live weapons, including pistols, machine guns, and grenades if found. The player can also drive abandoned vehicles. Driving vehicles will be in the traditional third-person view, and running or walking can be toggled between first and third person. [edit]Development  The game was first rumored to be in development in July 2008, when it was told that Assassin's Creed producer Jade Raymond was working on a new game. It was later announced at E3 2008, along with a trailer. It was later revealed that Raymond was not working on the game.[3] Development of the game experienced various delays until it was confirmed that the original developers, Darkworks, would not be working on it any longer due to a ""mutual decision"" and that the studio had other obligations, and that the game would instead be finished at Ubisoft Shanghai's studio.[4] On August 2009, various screenshots of an old build of the game were leaked onto the Internet. [5] The most recent date released by Ubisoft is set between Q2 April 2010- Q2 March 2011. These dates have since passed and there has been no new news from the developers. However, in June 2011 a notification was published at the Australian classification website which might indicate a release in the late summer of 2011[6]. Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot said at the start of 2010 that the studio was ""totally re-engineering the product.""[7] Elias Toufexis (who voices Adam Jensen in Deus Ex Human Revolution and Andriy Kobin in Splinter Cell Conviction) has a major role in this game. Ubisoft recently cancelled a number of games, but it was revealed that I Am Alive and another Ubisoft title Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 were not among them, with Ubisoft simply stating that the cancelled games were unannounced games.

Unfortunately I don't know how to cure it because what I have isn't curable, so I just look to ease the pain!  For baking soda, I think you should really give it a shot. I've read that baking soda balances the acid, which is irritating the bladder. It kind of works as a neutralizer. I'm unsure as to whether or not this will help for you because what we have is different, but when I thought I had a UTI is when the baking soda idea came up. ",749,80,1,0,0,1,®

This will only work with Windows Vista or Windows 7, though, as Windows XP and older need a floppy diskette for the drivers.  Regards,  Aryeh Goretsky ",17200,7131,0,0,1,0,®

t5_2qhh7,sotonohito,1309463856,"You can make a textbox for other without screwing up the database, but it makes analysis for demographics more difficult, largely because people get cute.  Look at the Metafilter gender box, no dropdowns, no options, pure freeform.  Which means you get people listing what should be counted as the same gender for demographic purposes as ""boy"", ""male"", ""man"", ""xy"", ""XY ♂"" ""♂"", ""outie"", etc.  If you don't care about running any sort of demographic analysis it isn't a big deal.  But if you do care (and, of course Google+ will care a great deal), than it makes for trouble.",409446,21488,0,0,1,1,♂
