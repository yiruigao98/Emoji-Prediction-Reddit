t5_2qh0u,zonto,1304250835,"&gt;Implied multiplication has a higher priority than explicit multiplication to allow users to enter expressions, in the same manner as they would be written. For example, the TI-80, TI-81, TI-82, and TI-85 evaluate 1/2X as 1/(2*X), while other products may evaluate the same expression as 1/2*X from left to right. Without this feature, it would be necessary to group 2X in parentheses, something that is typically not done when writing the expression on paper.   &gt;This order of precedence was changed for the TI-83 family, TI-84 Plus family, TI-89 family, TI-92 Plus, Voyage™ 200 and the TI-Nspire™ Handheld in TI-84 Plus Mode. Implied and explicit multiplication is given the same priority.  [Source](http://epsstore.ti.com/OA_HTML/csksxvm.jsp?nSetId=103110)",™

t5_2qm4e,Deckardz,1304302896,"((*My message was too long so I'm breaking it down into two comments*))  **I *cured* my own allergies, myself and no longer get huge allergy attacks or need to constantly take antihistamines.**   I used to get what seemed equivalent to the flu or a bad cold each pollen season, with runny eyes, headaches, feeling woozy, sinus infections from all the mucus, etc...     Since I started ""curing"" myself, I now have no or very minimal responses during allergy season.  Once in a while I might need to take a Zyrtec for 2 or 3 days, but that's about it - and with 2 allergy seasons per year, this means only once every few years this happens.     I've heard about local honey, too.. but: yes, **there is a theory and it worked for me.  It's called [The Bucket Theory](http://www.dustfree.com/allergys.htm)**.     When I first came upon this theory I immediately thought of another analogy that seems to make more sense than that of our immune systems being a bucket overflowing when ""full"": an animal trapped in a corner©.  *(what the heck, I might want to write about this one day)   Our bodies get to a point where they're like an animal trapped in a corner, surrounded by potential enemy combatants to the point where they're feeling so threatened that discernation is bypassed and our bodies basically ""say"" to antigens: ""one more of you come near me and I'm going to lash out at you with full force"" ..and so benign pollen comes along and fills up our mucus membranes and our immune system goes bezerk on it.       Of course, if our immune system were stronger, it might be more relaxed against this, just as a big athletic guy would feel comfortable around more potential combatants than a small scrawny guy might.  That's where I think *exercising* our immune system might come in and that is the relationship between people who were raised in or spent a long time in very clean environments having more allergies than those who grew up exposed to more of the environment (""eating some dirt"" from time to time).  Of course, chemicals could also be responsible.    If a cat was just chillin in a corner (SureIllDrawThat, where are you?) and it saw a rat it might have fun playing with it for a while and maybe kill it.     If it saw 4 it might kill them, then relax.     If it saw 10 it might get nervous thinking that one of them might be able to bite it while it was going after others, but wait to see if they were a threat before attacking (discerning whether they are bad or not).     If it saw 30 rats and it was cornered, it might try to keep them back by lashing out full-force at any that came near, in hopes that it would scare the others away and keep them at bay .     So, with one or even a few, the cat can just chill and take out the rats if it wants, but when there are a lot, it doesn't even have the luxury of evaluating whether each individual rat is hostile or hungry and might want to attack.  It must assume they're all hostile because the cat realizes that A. they can overwhelm the cat in numbers so it must terrorize them, and B. they can out-sustain the cat by continuing to come at it until the cat is too exhausted to continue defending itself.     That's my own interpretation that I think it actually more accurate than the bucket theory, and based on this, it makes sense to eliminate all toxins to our body because our immune system and cleansing system (I forgot the correct word for this - liver, kidneys, etc...) all together can become overwhelmed.     The steps I took are in the comment to this comment because the whole thing I typed was too long (*I got the message ""this is too long (max: 10000)""*).  ",©

I was looking on DirecTV a few months ago and there are if I'm remembering correctly 15? stations dedicated to religion.   Here this took me 20 minutes to put together... I THINK it's all of them.     **Christian Television Network (CTN)** *CTN features award winning programming reaching families spanning all socio-economic boundaries providing wholesome Christian Programming.*   **The Church Channel** *A network from TBN that primarily features church services from a wide variety of denominations including Protestant, Catholic and Jewish faith groups.*   **Enlace Christian Television** *Una cadena en español con programas de fe e inspiración para toda la familia. Disponible con todos los paquetes. Se requiere equipo multisatelital.*  **GOD TV** *GOD TV is a revolutionary new Christian network that features live events, music and key ministries.*  **Golden Eagle Broadcasting** *Oral Roberts University presents Golden Eagle Broadcasting, a Family-Safe® Programming Network.*  **Gospel Music Channel** *Gospel Music Channel is the only 24/7 television network dedicated to all genres of Gospel/Christian music - Rock. Pop. Country. Soul. It features artist biographies, specials, live concerts and videos for the entire family.*  **Hallmark Channel** *From one of the most trusted brands, Hallmark Channel delivers extraordinary original movies and award-winning entertainment you won't find anywhere else. Hallmark Channel is committed to high-quality entertainment characterized by cinematic excellence and strong stories that are relevant to viewers and their lives.*   **Hope** *Find peace, power, and purpose for your life. Hope Channel provides inspirational and educational programs for the entire family.*  **INSP** *INSP is a network that features information and entertainment content with patriotic and faith-oriented themes reflecting the diversity of audiences within the tradition of Middle America.*   **ION Television** *ION Television offers timeless, diverse family entertainment with a mix of television series, movies, specials and sports.*  **Jewish Life Television** *Jewish Life Television is the world's first 24-hour, full-time television network delivering Jewish-themed programming.*   **TCT Network** *a worldwide television network bringing the best in Christian educational, news and entertainment programming to your home daily*.  **Trinity Broadcasting Network (TBN)** *Serving many denominations, one of America's most-watched religious networks provides a variety of original programs, including Nashville gospel concerts, health and fitness, talk, children's features and services from some of America's largest churches.* World Harvest Television  *A family entertainment, news, and inspirational channel with programs designed to preserve and promote the traditional American value system through entertainment, education, news, and information.*   Yeah, that's 13 networks that spew (mostly) Christian crap 24/7. Then they take over the other channels all the time too.   You guys should be able to get an hour a week, national, at a good time. But... eh, I'm ranting now. ",®

t5_2qnmr,jeannaimard,1304441187,"&gt; I think the fear is that QC survives as a province now because of 8Bn$/yr in transfer payments from Alberta, without those the economy here will be much much worse. We would survive, but people will want to start playing the blame game.  (Sigh — I’m tired to repeat that obvious fact:) the $8 billion come to about $1200 per year per capita. Far less than what the federal encroachments on our competence costs us in federal taxes alone; so a separation would most definitely a positive gain for us, as well as the tightwads who loathe giving their holy money to us disgusting froggies (can you imagine? we have tasty food and we do not think that drinking alcoho0l is a sign of moral depravation! Oh! The humanity!).   &gt; The PQ will (as they did in 1995...) point to the immigrants and anglos first. I don't think this is a valid fear, as anything like expropriation would probably result in war with Canada, but I think a lot of people think it would be.  Expropriation? WTF?  As of war, the army chief of staff have already stated that they’d respect a democratic referendum. And besides, a lot more than 25% of the army is from Québec, and there are a lot of “separatists” in the army.  &gt; The most likely outcome is one where Quebec becomes as affiliated with Canada as the EU with itself.   The big difference with the European Union is that it’s constituents weren’t dragged kicking and screaming into it, and you don’t see a nation dominating another one.  &gt; Right away, QC will take a DRAMATIC paycut in Eqn payments, Canada will prosper: everyone wins.  Yeah, yeah, we heard this one before.  &gt; QC will continue to elect socialists,   Like yesterday?  &gt; but with few resources and little industry to drive the economy, the economy will get worse here.  More anglo-saxon claptrap to the effect that the french are incompetent. We have a lot of ressources and we have a lot of industry, most of it high technology.  &gt; Rising unemployment and inflation will push the best of the best of Quebecois will leave for the US and Canada.  Yes, sure, sure. Companies will gladly leave their markets to their competitors.  The fear tactics have been used before; they work less and less.  &gt; Lacking productivity gains and with a bloated debt to GDP ratio which makes financing improvements impossible, we'll slowly become a 3rd world country.

t5_2qpc3,BjornStravinsky,1304613741,"You seem to have music stores and Craigslist mixed up. If you're going to get scammed anywhere it's ebay and craigslist. Most music stores, particularly smaller ones that are around nowadays is due to them building up a local clientèle based on honesty and dependability.  As far as price range goes, you're generally best off with the most expensive instrument and amplifier as you can afford. Look at spending close to $300 to get a really good bass you won't outgrow in 12 months time. As HxCWildebeest said, Squier makes good instruments. The Squier Classic Vibe and Vintage Modified series is a solid choice for a beginner and I've known people who use them to gig with because they sound good, play good and won't break the bank if they get damaged or stolen at a concert.  Expect to pay in the range of $100 for a decent amplifier which will get you a good, clear sound. The Fender Rumble 15 or the Acoustic B10 are perfectly fine amps to use. They won't give your tone anywhere near the definition or character that say an Ampeg, a MarkBass, or a Galien Kruger will, but they won't make listening to yourself play as unpleasant as a MyFirstAmp ® by Fisher Price that you'll get at a costo or walmart.  If $400 total is too steep for you to justify, then I'd suggest you skimp on the bass and get an SX by Rondo Music. The amplifier is the most important part of the purchase as far as enjoying the sound goes, so buy one of these basses but keep the Fender or Acoustic amp.  http://www.rondomusic.com/bassguitars4.html  They're made out of decent materials and won't fall apart on you like say a Silvertone will. A friend of mine went out and bought themselves a Silvertone a couple of months ago. That thing is sitting in their closet with the neck irreparably warped and utterly unplayable. So don't get a Silvertone.   DO NOT BUY YOUR BASS AT TARGET, WALMART, OR ANY PLACE THAT SELLS ADULT DIAPERS IN BULK.

(Maybe E-Bay, but we all know how terrible of an idea that would be.) I would say that pay attention to the RAM, make sure the CPU clock is high enough, and make sure that the computer doesn't have an integrated(intel) gfx card. You'll want to be sure that the laptop has an AMD or an NVIDIA card in it. Other than that, I'm sure you'll be fine.

t5_6,kelana67,1304658517,"The fate of glyphosate in the environment is also not as benign as once thought. It's true that glyphosate either binds to soil or is broken down quickly by microbes. Glyphosate binds to any positively charged ion in the soil, with the consequence of making many nutrients (such as iron and manganese) less available to plants. Also, glyphosate stays in the soil bound to particles for a long time and can be released later by normal agricultural practices like phosphorus fertilization. ""It's not uncommon to find one to three pounds of glyphosate per acre in agricultural soils in the Midwest,"" says Huber, noting that this represents one to three times the typical amount of glyphosate applied to a field in a year.  Huber says these facts about glyphosate are very well known scientifically but rarely cited. When asked why, he replied that it would be harder for a company to get glyphosate approved for widespread use if it were known that the product could increase the severity of diseases on normal crop plants as well as the weeds it was intended to kill. Here in the U.S., many academic journals are not even interested in publishing studies that suggest this about glyphosate; a large number of the studies Huber cites were published in the European Journal of Agronomy.  If Huber's claims are true, then it follows that there must be problems with disease in crops where glyphosate is used. Huber's second letter verifies this, saying, ""we are experiencing a large number of problems in production agriculture in the U.S. that appear to be intensified and sometimes directly related to genetically engineered (GMO) crops, and/or the products they were engineered to tolerate -- especially those related to glyphosate (the active chemical in Roundup® herbicide and generic versions of this herbicide).""  He continues, saying, ""We have witnessed a deterioration in the plant health of corn, soybean, wheat and other crops recently with unexplained epidemics of sudden death syndrome of soybean (SDS), Goss' wilt of corn, and take-all of small grain crops the last two years. At the same time, there has been an increasing frequency of previously unexplained animal (cattle, pig, horse, poultry) infertility and [miscarriages].

I am 28 years old but I wear adult diapers (Depends™) so that the back of my pants doesn't have a streak of wetness down them. At first this was all I used them for -- to cover up the stain of my butt sweat -- but over time I learned to enjoy wearing diapers for the other benefits they confer. I can pee in public. I can be speaking to somebody and I can literally pee my pants, and nobody has to know but me. There are very few things quite as stimulating as unloading my bladder into soft cottony absorbent material and letting my penis swim around in urine for a while before everything is absorbed. Yesterday I was talking to a woman I have a crush on and I peed myself, and it was the most erotic thing that ever happened to me. I tried pooping in them once but it was a horrible mess to clean up and it smelled bad :(",™

t5_2qh1f,thoomfish,1304911719,"Since you mentioned keyboard shortcuts, here's another thing I like about OS X over Windows and Linux: OS X has 3 modifier keys that all do drastically different things. The Command key is for issuing commands, the Option key modifies the result of a command (including regular keystrokes, allowing easy entry of common alternate glyphs like é and ©), and the Control key is mostly used for UNIX-y stuff (like the system-wide Emacs keybindings in text fields).  In most Linux desktop environments, you only really have the Control key doing anything useful, with Alt being occasionally useful, and the Windows key largely vestigal (though Unity in Ubuntu Natty is changes that. I like their use of the Windows key quite a lot). These mappings stumble over themselves in Terminal use, because you expect Ctrl-C to copy, but instead it sends an interrupt signal to the currently running program -- in that one app you need to use Ctrl-Shift-C instead.  Windows spreads out things between the Control and Alt keys pretty evenly (and with no particular pattern that I've been able to discern in my decades of Windows use). Most commands are done with the Control key, but some are done with Alt, like Alt-F4 and Alt-D, just to fuck with you. The Windows key is useful occasionally, but more often annoying, since accidentally tapping it steals the keyboard focus and requires you to take action to get back to where you were. For some dumb fucking reason, there's no way to navigate around text without leaving the home row.",©

How do you determine if it doesn't introduce any bugs in your application?  Let's say you need some markup library, like Markdown, Textile or whatever for your application. You need it to provide some convenient syntax for comments in a website, like some popular news aggregation site you visit sometimes which has an alien logo in the header.  Everything works beautifully for months, no bugs, no problems. Maybe there are some corner cases it doesn't really parse that well, but it's not a big deal. One day, some server stops responding. A rare construct blows up the stack, or hits quadratic time behavior and bogs the system to it's knees. What do we do now?  Maybe it's a bit contrived, but eventually most applications have to deal with user input, and no matter what, you can't really determine ""no bugs"" early enough to be able to freeze a library.

t5_2cneq,KobeGriffin,1304972932,"Really nice response; thank you.  Where to begin… ☺  One very difficult problem which arises when discussing socialism, and specifically the Marxist brand, is we very quickly run out of parallels to the real world. In fact, the closet thing to socialism, as Marx understood it, which exists in the world today are the democratic socialist states, and those are clearly not the classless utopias which he envisioned.  Marx envisioned socialism as a transition period from capitalism to communism in which members of the working class control the means of production such that they provide for the needs of themselves and the outstanding members of the state (young, weak, sick etc.).  This is a society in which different skill sets, interests, and occupations exist, but from which the social class divisions which have arisen (naturally, Marx would even admit) Nowhere in the world has such a system ever existed.   Because of this, it becomes difficult to talk about what things would look like under this system (arguably, this is because the logical progression of history has not reached the stage where humans can comprehend such a system, because if we could, it would be implemented), and so it is difficult to find the proper terminology to describe just what a pure socialism would look like in terms we can recognize. Thus, I used the term “state” and the Greek “demos” to get across the point that socialism does not require that the state be in control as I initially stated, but that in Marxist socialism there is such a revolutionary change that the state is recognizable. This has lead to much confusion, which I think is unneeded   Specifically, Your problem seems to be on the basis of an equivocation of the terms ""state"" and ""demos"". Then you say stuff like this:  &gt;So, socialism only requires economic planning by the demos, but because anarchy is anti-state, it is also anti-socialist?  First, yes, anarchy is anti-state, but it is not anti-Marxist state, but anti-oligarchical, anti-monarchical, anti-capitalist *et al* state. Anti-traditional state. Because of this link, it is also not necessarily anti-socialist but really only anti-state in a way close to how a Marxist is anti-capitalist: they both a redefinition of social mores (any self-respecting anarchist would be anti-social democracy for instance). In this way, socialists and anarchists both want revolution, it is just different in what they want to impose. To properly quote me, and make the comparison obviously ridiculous, you should have replaced state with demos in both the places where I used it:  'So, socialism only requires economic planning by the demos, but because anarchy is anti-demos, it is also anti-socialist?'  Of course, it is not the case that anarchy is anti-demos (it is not anti-""people of the state"" directly, only opposed to their oppression as members of the *polis*). By that statement, I meant to imply that anarchists are anti-organized compulsory collective action when it is called the state, and so anti-socialist state as it is understood in the modern sense. Surely, such a thing can only be called a state, and thus where it exists an anarchist would reject it.   &gt;If we go by a definition in which it's possible for there to be an alternative to central planning, then syndicalism, or certain forms of market socialism, or certain types of social anarchy (or most likely, more than one of the above) would not qualify as centrally planned.  Did you mean not qualify as socialism? Actually, those organizations would qualify even for a strict Marxist. Marx didn't care as much about the particulars of the organization, so long as their function allowed the people to work for themselves. He could have stood a state, he just didn’t think it would look anything like what the anarchists rebel against.  My definition was that :  &gt;Socialism is an economic system in which the means of production and distribution of goods are centrally controlled by the state.  This you called discombobulated or wrong, both of which are much too strong. In fact, this was not the strict Marxist definition which I alluded to in this post, but is much closer to the modern accepted “government hooks everybody up model” especially regarding the distribution of goods. When you say that I am wrong or close to it are you denying that a state controlled economy is an essential element of many socialist theories?  You also wrote of my definition in a previous post  &gt;One that I don't know of a single socialist who ascribes to.  Which I would say is very surprising: not a single socialist you know thinks of vesting the state with control of the economy as essential to their goals? This is certainly part of the zeitgeist (“Obama is a socialist because he nationalized GM!”), and the actions of socialist states (Venezuelan oil first comes to mind). Are you suggesting that I made this definition up? I assure you, I am not that good.  The funny thing about this dialogue is that I just don’t seem much of a difference  Between your definition and mine.  Here is your definition:  &gt;...socialism [is] an economic system in which the means of production and distribution of goods are democratically controlled  Here is mine:   &gt;Socialism is an economic system in which the means of production and distribution of goods are centrally controlled by the state.  Then I later said:  &gt;As I have said consistently: socialism requires only economic planning by the demos. This can happen with any level of organization, and so long as it is collective, it is socialist.  Which seems to be literally your position.  I chose to use demos interchangeably with state a few times simply because the Marxist state is much further from our modern conception of state, and much closer to a group of dudes working at a factory with no boss.  It seems like you are flaming me. What gives?  ",☺

There was also a looming budget crisis and shortfall a a result of past administrations and poor legislation to reinvest into the society vs ""special treatment"" towards supporters.  Wikipedia has a good run down on his political downfall. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_Davis#Declining_popularity  There's been the viewpoint that Davis was in line for a strong bid for a  run for the White House as President.   That he was undermined and attacked in an organized fashion to prevent this from happening. It helps to also know that the entire recall movement was spawned by a multi millionaire car alarm maker and not as a grass roots citizens movement.

It wouldn't make Phoenixes completely useless, as they can still do a fly-by drone harass and get some target practice in with the overlords, but with less impunity rather than almost full impunity. Voids would be nicely balanced with the +20% vs massive trade-off.   The reason I like this idea the most is it gives the Zerg more options, (And they really are in dire need of that). If a Z goes for a Spanishiwa-style where he crawls queens to the front to attack a Sentry-heavy Toss army, then guess what? He brought the right units to the right fight at the right time. Toss can always react by killing off queens *en route,* targeting them down, or spending their gas on more Stalkers. Or, imagine a mid-game engagement where a particularly clever Zerg loads up some Queens in an overlord, and transports them to the front with their faster army so as to counter the infamous Protoss Death Ball™?   My point is, this would make PvZ a more dynamic matchup for both races, without handing a huge advantage to one side or the other. ",™

It's my personal opinion that nothing significant will happen tomorrow because obviously nothing ever does in terms of Doomsday prophesies. The only thing they have ever historically accomplished has been scaring the living shit out of gullible people, which is their sole intent and purpose. I kind of see it as a very grandiose trolling. This isn't to say that there will never be a ""self-fulfilling prophecy"", or someone who takes it upon themselves to ensure that something that has been prophecized comes to fruition, but I don't think earthquakes count unless the person(s) who intend to fulfill the prophesies are in control of the weather.",™
t5_2fwo,anvsdt,1305062798,"&gt; I'd indent how your editor would but with any implied parens removed.  The point is, it's more the pain of indenting it properly than matching the parens. If I have an expression `* x y\n\t+ z w` that means `(* x y (+ z w))`, and then I want `+ z w` on the same line of `* x y`, I'll also have to remember to put the parens. Then they *would* become annoying. Much like the automatic semicolon insertion in JS, it seems useful, but causes more problems than it solves.  &gt; If your example was a little saner, I'd try it. (Not that I'm in the habit of working in pure lambda calculus(?))  Well, yes, it was *a little* too much. It was the first thing short and complex enough I could find. Sorry about that.  &gt; And you still have that tree structure, it's just defined by indentation as well as some parens. You just edit with enter/tab/backspace instead of ""("" / "")"".  I have code indented like a tree, not a tree.  &gt; The former, that's where you pasted it,  I actually meant `(* x x (+ 4 ...))`. I know *precisely* what some code will mean when I paste it between parentheses. There it is ambiguous. It can mean three different things, the editor cannot always guess how I meant to paste it. The fact is, the implicit closing parens are all after the dedents, so the code is more like:      (define (f x)        (* x x      | )) ; or ) | ) ; or )) |  Where | is the cursor. The problem *does* exist, else no one would ever complain about Python code being a pain to paste.  &gt; if you want the latter indent before you paste. Just like you'd need to specify by exact position if you had parens.  That's error-prone. I can see the parens (I actually don't, since I just move to the end of the list using, again, some structural editing mode to get), but I can't see indents/dedents.  &gt; So delete sqrt and insert it before let, you could easily have the editor maintain the indentation automatically on the rest of the block:  That's a trivial transformation's trivial case. It quickly gets more complex. (p.s. your `let` doesn't work; p.p.s. you still need parens around the whole `let`)  Also, the editor should add/remove parens accordingly to make the code mean what it is meant to mean. That's a needless complication for me, you would care more about the parens now than before. Yes, it would be easier to read for non-Lisp people, but it would be harder to write.  &gt; (Unless you mean with macros, in which case, the underlying structure is the same so any macro will work fine regardless of syntax.)  I'm talking about editing and fancy source code transformation, they are equivalent to S-expressions. (if you look at them as syntactic sugar for them, like `'expr ↔ (quote expr)`, else it would break `code=data` and you'd need a special indentation-sensitive data structure)  Also, again, opinions.",↔

Modern termite treatments are now so effective that significant damage is rarely an issue. Repair bonds are written so as to exclude previous damage and conditions caused by the homeowner; and were created when the most effective chemical (Dursban), had a very short half life. ""Repair Bonds"" always state that ""live termites"" must be present. Even if the treatment was defective, the chance of finding live termites, after the inspector of your company has been there, is almost nil. There is very little chance that you will receive damage with a Termidor® treatment, and less of a chance that the money you spend on a repair bond will pay off, if you do.  Long time bar and restaurant employee. There is a good chance that one or more of the following has taken place: The liquor in your drink has fruit flies in it, the fruit is old, not washed before being cut, not cut on a sanitary surface, and may have rolled around on the cooler floor before making its way to your drink. The straw from your drink has been touched by the filthy hands of bartenders and servers umpteen times. Roaches have likely walked on your glass and straw. The ice in your drink was probably left overnight, and may have been used to store bottles of beer, wine and liquor before arriving in your glass. In the state where I live (Florida) health inspectors never seem to darken the door of bars, so all bets are off when it comes to cleanliness and food safety.  Bar Auditor: If you are smart and dishonest, you can work as a bartender and make major money stealing under the nose of the bar owner. Even bars with cameras and standard ""inventory systems"" do not have the ability to catch the real pros. The only truly effective system employs auditors who use bar code scanners, scientific scales, and compare usage to sales. If your bar begins using a service with this system, move on to a different bar that doesn't have it. Most bar owners have no clue how to determine who is stealing.   ",®

t5_2qhk2,eschermond,1305254707,"I can't really draw or create anything artistically but, here's a little story I wrote:  In the waking hours on the Day of Týr, as the sun reflects its gilded glints off the eddies of the Little Falls, The Water Ghoul emerges through the haze of the Iuniores weather, from his unseen place of respite, somewhere behind and within the Hill of Roc. Upon his blistered and malformed shoulder, he carries the burden which has been his to bear for more time than he can recall. The Urn, yellow as the Nonahora sun, and inscribed with the blood of his predecessor, rests unerringly in the crater which had been shaped into his shoulder many years ago. The inscription - Igloo® - in a language long forgotten, and even longer unspoken. Even the Water Ghoul, a creature who has been alive for many thousands of years, does not know what it means. The only thing the Water Ghoul does know is that someday it will be his blood inscribed upon the urn. But that would not be for another many thousands of years, and today he had his charge to think of. The Water Ghoul carries the receptacle to it's place upon the Altar of Ulma. The poultice within sloshes furiously as he places it down, as if trying to free itself from it's wretched container. The Water Ghoul waits, then, for the one they call ""The Operator"" to read his mind. With the frenzied and fantastic flailing of his spindly arms and gnarled, arthritic hands - a signal understood by none save the Water Ghoul, one that changes every day - the Urn rises from the Altar of Ulma, moving mystically through the air as if lifted by a machine.  The Urn lowers down into the depths of the crevasse. Where countless minions toil endlessly in the craggy excavations of the Montclair Mountains. It is received there, it's untold contents providing relief in one of two ways: a brief cooling of an unending thirst, brought upon by countless hours working under a burning sun, or death. Where one dies, ten more spring up from the place in the mountains known as ""The Hall,"" ready to continue the never-ending and pointless work, like a herd of ants in an expansive farm. The Water Ghoul knows nothing of this, however. His task done for the day, he returns to his unseen home, and waits for a new day to begin. A day which will bring him one step closer to death.",®

t5_2s5ni,Surrealis,1305296452,"It depends on what you consider flirting, and definitions vary quite wildly. Does it have to be sleazy banter and/or pickup lines or whatever it is that people do in movies, or can it merely be a Conversation With Subtext™ between people who may find each other attractive? Is all flirting necessarily an attempt to impress a potential date/lay, or can you flirt harmlessly with someone you're not interested in actually doing anything with?  I find people who flirt without tact to be a little obnoxious, but I do find that while I have normal conversations with attractive people in terms of subject matter, the tone tends to be a bit more playful if I'm interested, and really, most people would consider you to be ""flirting"" with that alone.  So essentially, I'd argue that, for people with a modicum of maturity, flirting isn't about prattling on or bravado, it's about subtle aspects of presentation and delivery that make it clear from the context that you're interested. Humans are really good at reading non-explicit cues from each other, and flirting is a good example of that in action.",™

The god you're referring to is Apollo (Helios, for those who don't realize they're the same god), and it's not even his fault. It's his son's.  See, Apollo had an illegitimate son named Phaethon. Phaethon was a little shit who loved being a little shit. Anyhow, Phaethon didn't know he was Apollo's son. So he went about his life, doing stuff, and then his mom informed him he was Apollo's son. So he takes a hike up to Apollo's palace and says, ""hey dad, give me your sun chariot, I want to be the rising sun (the chariot pulls the son)."" And Apollo says, ""hold on, let me cover your head in oil."" So he covers Phaethon's head in oil, then gives him the reins.  So he goes out riding. But, if you were keeping up with the story, you'd remember that Phaethon is a little shit. So he can't handle the badass fire horses that pull the flying chariot which is pulling the ""sun"". So he accidentally sets the world on fire (he didn't want to, he just wanted to start a flame in your heart). Well, some of that fire lands in Africa, blackening their skin.   Zeus, while cheating on Hera (probably in the form of some animal, like usual) sees Phaethon setting the world on fire, so he kills him with a lightning bolt. Well, Phaethon crashes, and his cousins are there and they start crying and turn into trees with amber dripping from them to represent them crying.  Later on, our good friend Pygmalion takes some of this amber (which is actually tears of former humans) and gives them to a statue, which he proceeds to make out with. The statue comes to life because Pygmalion hates hookers and Venus/Aphrodite does too, and they life happily ever after (no, this doesn't work with Real Dolls™).",™

t5_2ql0i,ranma,1305437207,"The crux of the justification problem is the ""manga is just for kids"" notion. We have all the naughty bits in art, literature, music, and film, and most people don't mind and even enjoy it.   But, think of the _children!!!_  The problem with comparing manga with literature and art, the two most obvious precursors, is that the literary critics usually only look at the written narrative and the art critics only look at the visuals. Both of them say, ""Well, this is kind of interesting, but it's not at the same level as blah blah blah."" Both aspects are (usually) found to be wanting when compared and evaluated in isolation from the other.  What critics usually fail to do is realize that manga, and comics in general, are not just a simple blending of the two forms. Comics usually follows the narrative structure of literature but uses the mechanics of illustration with a rhythm and expository mode that is like film (which borrowed many of its tropes from music.)  But it is neither of those things. It is a synthesis that is unlike either. Comparing one art form directly to another is always a trap.    The other problem that westerners, and Americans in particular, have with manga, other than the ""kids"" label is that the story telling techniques are much more mature than (most) of western comics.  Now I'm a long time fan of American comics and animation, and I'm not comparing American culture directly to Japanese culture; but in the comics scene, this is largely a numbers game.  The audience for manga is much larger, and much broader in demographic than the audience for comics in the United States.   The number of creators for manga is also larger.  In Japan there is a _huge_ amateur manga community that is ridiculously active. At the average Comiket show, which happens twice a year, there are easily _30,000_ exhibitors!  Let me say that again, _30,000_ groups, not just individuals, creating manga. And Comiket is by no means the only amateur manga show, merely the largest.  Now [Sturgeon's_Law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturgeon's_Law) applies here. Lot's of this output, both commercial and amateur is dross. But if only even a small percent is Good Stuff™ then this helps to create a climate where those with talent, or those capable of developing talent, can prosper and find an audience.  If American comics don't have the success or the level of quality that Japanese comics do, it is because the audience is smaller and/or much more specialized.  For myself, I would say that manga such as _Yokohama Kaidashi Kikō_ (Yokohama Shopping Diary) are as good as stories or novels by Ray Bradbury and as good as films by the Coen Brothers. _Lone Wolf and Cub_ is as good as Coleridge's _Rime of the Ancient Mariner_. But while such comparisons are fun, and help explain themes and motifs, they aren't really that useful as a means for rating _quality_, whatever that is.  I mean, which is better, novels by James Joyce or songs by the Beatles?  Movies by Stanley Kubrick or paintings by Manet? How does Shakespeare stand up against Beethoven?  (And just so everyone doesn't think that I'm a chauvinist against American comics, I'll say that Milton Caniff's _Terry and the Pirates_ compares very favorably to Dickens and Kipling. And Jack Kirby is in class all by himself; you compare other works and media to _him_ rather than the other way around...)  ",™

In 2007, a group at the University of Alberta led by cardiologist Evangelos Michelakis demonstrated that very high doses of DCA can slow the progression of human tumor cells grown in immunocompromised rats. The response to this story was unbelievable with internet marketers popping up to sell the simple chemical and conspiracy theorists saying that because DCA was cheap and not patentable, no drug company would ever develop it, it was being kept a secret, and so. In truth, the work was in very, very early stages. &gt;  &gt; This didn't stop hopeful patients from seeking out DCA sellers even though DCA can be contaminated with other related substances that are far more toxic. And in the most egregious case among these DCA purveyors, an Edmonton man who purported to sell DCA online was recently arrested in Phoenix and pleaded guilty to five cases of wire fraud - not because he was selling DCA but rather a white powder comprised of some combination of sucrose, lactose, dextran, and starch. &gt;  &gt; Yes. Not even the unproven DCA. Fake DCA. &gt;  &gt; The best coverage of the DCA story was put forth by my blogging colleague, Orac at Respectful Insolence, who wrote over 20 posts on issues associated with the previous study and the internet marketing of DCA. At the bottom of [this post](http://scienceblogs.com/terrasig/2007/10/dichloroacetate_dca_phase_ii_t.php) where we wrote about this trial beginning, there is a list of links to Orac's posts as well as eight or nine of our own. &gt;  &gt; This week, the Michelakis group has published [a follow-up paper](http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/2/31/31ra34.abstract) in Science Translational Research that includes laboratory experiments with cell lines isolated from cancer of 49 volunteers and a phase I trial of DCA in five patients with advanced glioblastoma who were also receiving a standard anticancer drug temozolomide ([Temodar®](http://www.temodar.com/temodar/index.html)) and radiation therapy.... &gt;  &gt; ... &gt;  &gt; Since I cannot yet access the paper, I wish to direct you to [a superb and approachable review](http://scienceblog.cancerresearchuk.org/2010/05/12/potential-cancer-drug-dca-tested-in-early-trials/) of the latest findings written by Dr Kat Arney at the Cancer Research UK blog, Science Update. The four closing paragraphs of her article include modified verbiage that Cancer Research UK has been using in patient information content about DCA since 2007: &gt;  &gt; &gt; It is clear that DCA is an intriguing drug - one of many currently being investigated by scientists around the world. It will be interesting to see the results of more extensive lab-based experiments and larger clinical trials of DCA. And cancer cell metabolism is certainly a productive area of research that we're actively funding. &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; **The fact that DCA is off-patent is no barrier to its development as a treatment for cancer. For example, Cancer Research UK has secured a licence for an off-patent drug called fenretinide, which could be used to treat rare childhood cancers. And there is certainly no ""conspiracy"" by pharmaceutical companies to prevent research into DCA - there is just not enough evidence at the moment to support its widespread use to treat patients.** &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; While these results are intriguing, it is unlikely that this one compound represents ""the cure"" for cancer - and it is also unlikely that DCA is the ""wonder drug"" that the headlines portray. Cancer is a complex and multi-faceted disease, and it can be caused by a range of different faults within the cell. It is unlikely that any single drug could ever treat all forms of the disease. &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; There are many promising new treatments for cancer currently in development, funded by organisations across the globe - including Cancer Research UK. If anything, these new results show why research is so important in bringing safe and effective treatments to people with cancer - they don't provide definitive answers, but they support further investigations which may yield benefits for patients in the future. &gt; &gt; Pharmaceutical chemist Dr Derek Lowe who blogs at In The Pipeline also has [a nice post](http://pipeline.corante.com/archives/2010/05/14/dca_and_cancer_more_results.php) on his perspective.",®
t5_2qhrv,sparrowpua,1305493681,"Lol, so defensive. No one says bringing strippers home for a threesome doesn't happen. No one is challenging your abilities either. What's more, I AGREE with a lot of what you said - as I mentioned. Why am I repeating that to you?  All we're saying is that the way you wrote your post was unclear, and you were especially ambiguous about whether you fucked the girls at the end. If that happened, awesome, if not, well it is still an awesome night you had. No worries.  Anyway, good post, upvoted, lots of good stuff, and I'm looking forward to reading more. ♥",♥

t5_2qhrv,sparrowpua,1305495033,"Maybe it's possible. You can try it out.  With regards to having lots of sex with lots of girls, I'd say, ""Don't knock it 'til you've tried it."" Getting out of your comfort zone to experience different ways of living is a good thing too. If you're getting laid constantly by different girls for a few months and *then* you decide you don't like it, *that's* what I'd call an informed decision, otherwise, your decision is possibly being influenced by less by experience and more by what other people tell you.  If you do end up learning seduction while withholding sex from 90% of girls you pull, you should write about your experiences on Seddit. Just be aware that if you approach Pick Up like this, you may have to deal with girls wondering if:  1. You're gay. 2. Too gutless to make a move. 3. That you think you're too good for them.  It'd be interesting to read how you deal with those issues, so I sort of hope you approach Pick Up the way you describe. ♥",♥

t5_6,taxreliefsys,1305506475,"IRS Liens A tax lien is a method imposed by the IRS to collect any outstanding debt from the tax payer. Normally this tax lien is directed towards property owned by the tax payer, although the IRS can seize virtually all assets owned by the tax payer.  This is where we come in. If you get notice by the IRS that a tax lien is about to be placed on your property, call Tax Relief Systems and allow us to negotiate with the IRS to prevent them from filing the tax lien.   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Business Payroll Businesses are required to to pay quarterly and annual taxes to the IRS.

t5_2qhx4,texmo,1305509647,"At the same time, it is highly probable that sprinting-evoked, systemic AMPk activation simultaneously curtails an individual’s natural genetic propensity for fat-storage as well. This is because, in response to the rapid ATP-depletion prompted by those repeated, maximal-intensity bouts of anaerobic expenditure, AMPk also works to curtail Acyl-coenzyme A: diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT1) activity and glucose uptake into adipocytes. This saves ATP for energy repletion rather than having it be ""misallocated"" to synthesize new triacylglycerol (TAG) in your adipocytes (21, 22, 23). I desperately want to write something witty here, but—to be perfectly honest—the above dynamic still strikes me as so miraculous that it generally tends to leave me at a loss for words whenever I go back and re-conceptualize it. But, trust me, it’s ""pretty good"" to have this going on, which just goes to show how potent a physique-shaping force sprinting can be when it comes to furthering your bodybuilding goals.  Unfortunately, due to space constraints, that’s going to have to do it for this installment of sprinting examined ""Avant-style."" In next issue’s Part II, I’ll be returning to take a look at sprint technique and methodology, different strategies for incorporating sprint-work into your lifting split, and also harkening on emerging aesthetic trends in the realm of contemporary bonsai-gardening. Or maybe I’ll just throw in a few supplement recommendations. I don’t know; I’m still a little undecided on that last part. But until then, I’m off to the races, off with the hope that you’ll all soon follow. Cheers all.    References Cited:  1.

t5_2qh1i,DarthContinent,1305560371,"Of course, it was meant entirely in jest.   One reason I've struggled over the decision of whether to try my hand at writing full-time is the thought of having to deal with content poachers who would readily upload my work to some torrent site thinking they're some kind of Robin Hood, but actually taking money out of my pocket, ""liberating"" content they didn't sweat over to create.  Certainly there's truth in the notion that creators of content should be compensated, and though I torrent a lot I do try to buy content I've really enjoyed. The availability of software, movies, music and books in digital format is such though that greed runs rampant, it's like shoplifting without leaving home.  Ultimately I think greed is what drives businesses like music studios or art galleries or magazines, for example, not some idyllic notion of promoting the work as art.   I think ideally at least the very basics of life should be free to everyone, enabling many people to stop wage slaving themselves 9-5 or beyond and instead be able to work on that cozy level of Maslow's hierarchy, self-actualization. Too many would-be artists get stuck in dead-end jobs, unable to do as the late Joseph Campbell would suggest and *""follow your bliss.""*   Level the playing field for everyone, remove greed as the driving force in society which leads the rich to live off the backs of the not rich, and things will change for the better.

Reddit overall (and I say this with my five-year coming up in a few months) is now just a pseudo-intellectual version of Digg and is just a shell of what it used to be. Rage comics, in particular, draw the derpiest herp-the-derp turds possible to the point that when I go to Dad's it's all I hear about from our step sister and her BF. I removed it from my front page because of the absolute shit people are submitting. ""HERP DERP LE FLERP DA NERP....SPIDERS!"" Don't take it to heart, this sub is filled with Hot Topic kids. This mini-rant is nothing new, either, so...yeah. I'm a hipster Redditor and I Liked It Before It Was Big™.   Always great to hear that I shouldn't change. I don't plan on it, much. The only people giving me crap are family members -- my 9-5 buddies and weekend friends are more supportive than my own family at this point. Which is weird. I only feel awkward or unloved around family -- full stop.  At Dad's for my b-day I sat by myself at the table while everyone wandered around the house making idle conversation like I wasn't there for nearly 20 minutes. I was given the option of choosing my cake, which ended up being carrot (not the chocolate I'd asked for). The card from dad just said, ""Happy Birthday"" (no letter/note) and it was similar in feel when I went to Mom's. With my family I just feel like an afterthought. I don't know. Haven't refined the analysis, but it's the only real low moment I have in life nowadays.  I'm not depressed even though maybe I should be, but I do miss the hell out of you and Ash. I miss murdering zombies, zerglings and THOSE GOD-DAMN SPIES (W+M1 pyro fixes all) on the regular and I miss having someone to talk with that I felt really understood me.

There is hardly anything of substance to recommend this train wreck to a discerning connoisseur of RPGs. Every element of its design can be described as 'embarassingly awkward.' Animation, art direction, dialogue, writing, combat. It's a list of sad mediocrities as long as your arm. The fact of the setting and characters being a shameless copy of Michael **** classic Elric of MelnibonÃ© series aside, the game itself behaves like a confused child. Does it want to be a brawler with peripheral RPG elements? Or an action RPG with brawler combat? In either situation the designers have failed to deliver on both satisfying combat or a compelling story that ever rises above the juvenile.

Royalists searching for terms related to the upcoming nuptials (e.g., “Middleton wedding dress idea”) are likely to find links to scareware portals among the top results. Surfers who visit these portals will be encouraged to download software that falsely warns of non-existent security threats in a bid to trick marks into paying for worthless software.  Miscreants use search engine manipulation techniques themed around items in the news to drive traffic to such sites and the upcoming royal wedding is no exception. Indeed a similar scareware punting ruse was launched when Kate and Wills announced their engagement last year.  A write- up of the latest scareware scam can be found in blog posts by GFI Software (here) and Eset (here). ®   ",®

t5_2qh63,Tagedieb,1305734621,"&gt; The fact that germany is doing relatively well doesn't mean it's doing well.  Well it's doing better than the last &gt;20 years, both by growth of GDP and by employment rate. You are setting the bar pretty high, sounding like the famous german banker Josef Ackermann that said a ROE of 20% is bare minimum for any business. I get more and more the feeling that you only raise the bar to convince me (or yourself) that you are right.  Harvard, isn't that the place where almost only rich kids™ can study? And if you are a rich kid, then you are ""too heavy to fail""? Isn't that the place that is sitting on a liquid funds of 29 billion dollars? Seems like quite a business place to me. Of course they hate taxes with a passion, because they can afford everything they need, they don't need government to provide infrastructure for them.  The problem with a study is, that it doesn't make an argument by logic, but instead seeks for evidence for one opinion or the other. I don't say studies like that have lower quality, but I would say its harder for me to check their facts. They can easily give wrong or incomplete data without me being able to verify it. Someone else could easily claim the opposite with data that seems to support it, without me being able to verify it either. The only thing I know, is that based on empirical evidence™ the conclusion they make is wrong. Just look at german economy, that prooves, that government intervention, if done right, can help the economy a lot. And you just saying ""it could be even better"" doesn't change that. Of course, I don't say the government should just mindlessly throw around with money and that fixes everything, which is the assumption that was made in the Milton Friedman video you linked.  Well, and you know what? Small and medium businesses are the backbone of the german economy and they are the main engines in the fast and stable recovery. So our policies don't seem to be so bad for medium and small businesses after all. Of course there will always be whiners, that say lowering taxes would help the overall economy. But more and more people seem to understand that that's not true, the party of those whiners (FDP) fell from 18% to 3% in the last two years.  Again, please understand that I approve with you in saying the government should start to get sober on the spending side. But I am personally proud of the german finance minister Schäuble (I really hate the guy otherwise with a passion), that he insists on not lowering taxes even though the income side is looking better and better every time a new tax estimation is being made. First you get rid of your debts, and only then you start reducing taxes.  You know what I think? In some places it's easier to do some things than in others. If you are a farmer for example you are highly dependend on the local weather. A business is highly depended on the conditions of its customers. And if any of those conditition changes, you can either try to adapt to the situation or you can stick your head in the sand and whine. Maybe germany is not the easiest place to do business. But it doesn't stop people of having very succesful and strong businesses. And since the government is highly in debts, it cannot afford to lower taxes. But if all the business people then stop working and start to whine, then of course it's bad for the economy. But we will always have changing conditions and special necessities. So they should just try to think of solutions, instead of just complaining. This is what they did in germany, and this helped. Of course it was also helpful for them to know that everyone else is doing their part, too. As I described before with the short labor, which is just one example of how government, unions and employer's representatives work together in germany to solve common problems. But if you lack this atmosphere of willingness to solve problems together without throwing anyone out of the picture, then of course everyone has to put all their power to support his own personal agenda instead of just giving in to the will of the other. You know, but after a few decades of fights between labor unions and employer's representatives, at some point they understand that their interests are not necessarily contradicting, so they start to think of solutions that will help everyone. Call me naive, but this is what I see unfolding in germany before my eyes.  Since the soccer championship 2006 in germany, we have learned a new kind of national pride. It is not defined by anyone thinking we are exceptional in any way. But instead of knowing we must work together to reach a goal. We must respect and care for each other to be strong. Germany became less selfish in that year, because of that new spirit. And I am pretty sure that this new spirit helped people realizing, that they don't only work for themselfes. And that those that pay more taxes (due to their higher income) can be happy to be able to contribute more to society. In germany everyone owes to the society, because we have public schools, public transportation, public everything. Only few people are not happy about that. Yes, we had our share of privatizations in the nineties and early 2000's. But it turned out that most of them did more harm then help. Because suddenly there are additional people (investors) in between, that want to profit, while before it was ok if some public service makes some minus and others make some plus. And you can surely do that as long as the efficiency is bad. But what if it isn't? Now everything has to grow, everything must make more and more profit. A lot of people learned, that they actually suffer a lot from those changes. People are actually overall happy with what the government is doing in this respect. Tell me that this isn't possible or sustainable all you want. Reality in germany tells a different story.",™

t5_2qhta,dooflotchie,1305740127,"I just went through this a few months ago with Dude. I noticed he was peeing a lot, he lost weight and had a very dry, flaky coat. We caught him early too. [Feline Diabetes.com](http://www.felinediabetes.com/) was a huge help. After reading up on it I was sure we could reverse Dude's condition. We immediately changed his diet to grain-free wet food only. Blue Wilderness wet is perfectly acceptable for that. Maybe your kitty will eat that since he had the Blue dry before. That's what I was feeding Dude when he got diabetes. (I don't blame the food, he is huge and slightly overweight.) We tried the BW wet but he won't eat it, so we went with Wellness grain-free wet. The other things you said about diet were spot-on, especially the ""treats"" of human food. Those MUST stop forever right now. That's not to say he can't have *any* treats. Just stick with grain-free ones. Now you might be thinking, ""How and where will I find grain-free cat treats?"" There are some brands out there, but not very many...until you look in the dog food section. That can be a huge help. Just because the package has a dog on it instead of a cat doesn't mean your cat can't eat them. You have to look for treats that are soft enough for a cat to chew and if they are bigger than you want, cut or break them up. Stay away from treats that are the consistency of semi-moist cat food. Those have a lot of sugar in them. I stick with single-ingredient freeze dried meat treats. I give my cats [these,](http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.jsp?productId=4406466) [these,](http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.jsp?productId=3678515) [these,](http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.jsp?productId=11147080) [these,](http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.jsp?productId=4280382) [and these.](http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2751598)  Now, for food. I already mentioned the Wellness wet. Merrick is another good brand for this too but the Duder doesn't really like it. You're probably better off steering clear of the prescription food. Look at the ingredients in them and compare it to BW, Wellness or Merrick and you can easily see which is the better quality food!   ➡➡➡➡➡**HUGELY IMPORTANT THING!!!**  Get a glucose monitor and test your cat at home. You *can* use a regular glucose monitor for humans, but you *MUST* first take it to the vet's office with you and check your meter against theirs to see by how many points your reading differs from theirs with the same blood sample. There is a slight difference in the reading you will get with one made for humans and one made for pets, but if you know what the variance is you can get along fine with the $20 human glucose monitor instead of the $100 pet one.  I know this is a huge long post, but there's a lot to learn and quickly so you take the best care of your cat. Just remember there is hope here...I know you must have been freaked out to hear ""diabetes"", but is absolutely IS true that if it is caught early enough it can be reversed with diet and glucose monitoring. I did all of these things with Dude.  You wanna know how long he had to take insulin before we were sure that he went into remission with the diet changes?  TWO WEEKS!  Please keep me posted on how Chairman Meow is doing, and PM me any time if you want to talk or have questions! HTH and good luck!",➡

My impression of Realtor®s is that they'd rather get the sale any day over dicking with you to try and scrape another few thousand dollars for the seller.

t5_2qh63,boona,1305742815,"&gt;Harvard, isn't that the place where almost only rich kids™ can study?  You do understand that libertarianism is not popular amongst large corporations right? Otherwise Ron Paul could count on contributions from big business instead of small contribution donated $50 increments by military personnel and the general population.  &gt;And if you are a rich kid, then you are ""too heavy to fail""?  Libertarians *STRONGLY* and vehemently opposed the bailouts and wanted these bad banks and bad corporations to fail. I think you're erroneously conflating libertarianism and neo-conservatism.  &gt;The problem with a study is, that it doesn't make an argument by logic, but instead seeks for evidence for one opinion or the other.  Firstly, Harvard has no libertarian leanings so that is a ridiculous statement. If you don't have a look at the study itself then you are just discounting the study because it doesn't fit your world view not because of the study itself.  &gt;Maybe germany is not the easiest place to do business. But it doesn't stop people of having very succesful and strong businesses.  How many more businesses would there be if it was easier? Like you said it's not impossible for some but it is practically impossible for a lot of people. This tips the scales in favor of people that have been in business or are in families that own businesses. This of course puts anyone else at a disadvantage and makes it harder for the poor to come out of poverty. You say this as though it was nothing but the unseen impact very real and devastating to those you seem to want to help.  &gt;Of course there will always be whiners, that say lowering taxes would help the overall economy  That is a basic economic fact. I really recommend you read some of the material I linked to.  I don't mean this in a condescending way (you might take it that way) but the conversation is difficult to hold because you base a lot of your logic on economic fallacies. I so as I said before, read the material, and once you have a better understanding of how economics works we can discuss this further. Much like debating with a physicist that gravity does not exist he/she would recommend that you crack open a science book and do some experiments before going any further. Again, sorry if that sounds condescending, but a lot of what you say is just not up for debate, it's just how the world works.",™

t5_2qtp5,majeric,1305844844," Sometimes ya have to call a spade a spade. It amazes me to the degree by which you are arguing against something when the cold hard facts are staring you in the face.  You're engaging in rationalization. Not reason. You're coming from the perspective that ""discrimination against women is no longer a problem"" and there for there MUST be some other explanation for it. So you're working hard to show that it isn't discrimination. You're trying to reverse engineer an argument.  But you're not backing up your view. You're not giving me facts. You're not showing me how statistics can be skewed in this context (Your argument about race is just uncomfortable).   I understand the nature of sample size. I have taking university level statistics. That's why we have margins of error. Are you really suggesting that the margin of error in this context is in the 10s of %? The study was about 4379 roles in movies. That's not a small sample size. Sure I an accept that there's a skew in the focus of the 100 or so movies but that unto itself is demonstration of bias. I just simply have to show that the top 100 movies each year for the past 50 years have a heavy male bias. The focus of the 100 movies each year is a part of the discriminatory bias.  the following is a quote from the study:  &gt; Three separate findings support this claim. First, only 29.9% of the 4,379 speaking characters across the 100 films coded in study 1 are female. These findings are strikingly similar to the results we found examining over 15,000 speaking characters (27% are female) in 400 G, PG, PG-13, and R rated films released between 1990 and 2006 as well as 6,833 speaking characters (27.3% are female) in 150 Academy Award® Best Picture nominated films from 1977 to 2006.   Two more sets with sample sets that are much larger and span a larger time frame. The study's conclusion is supported by other findings.    The evidence is clear.  Why are you so bothered by the idea that women are still discriminated against? It's not like society transforms over night and suddenly it's equality for all. We still have work to do. There's still things that need to get better.  ",®

t5_2qq2q,deviationblue,1306062096,"First off, I like you and I love your cooking, but this *is* Reddit, and I have to refute some of your points because on this issue I almost entirely disagree with you.  &gt; Since when has someone in the military had to pinch pennies to make ends meet? They get special loans for homes, health care, discounted food and other goods (no need for cost-co memberships)  Military families are far from made of money.  Most often young adults join the military because they're either a) from military families and were raised/trained to do so, or b) don't have much of a future as ordinary Joes or Joses.  Military salaries are fair, but they aren't a LOT unless you're an officer.  Most often you'll come across enlisted men - grunts, cannon fodder, etc. - when they're young and living in BEQ (bachelor enlisted quarters), they spend all their money on booze and pizza (I know, I bring 'em their pizza, about 60% of the orders I deliver are to MCAS Miramar) and don't save worth a damn.  Then, at a ball or party or something, they get married and pop out baby units (or the other way around), get placed in family housing, without a lot of savings to their name, and certainly without a raise in pay.  Granted, their rent and basic utilities are paid for, but you know how much it costs to raise a family.  And yeah, maybe they ride the ""AMERICA FUCK YEAH"" train a little bit too hard for freebies, but honestly, in the same position, wouldn't you?  Especially if rednecks are willing to hand you breaks, you'd be a fool not to take them.  &gt; where the civilians have to sweat it out under the burdens of student loans and paying through the nose for everything. Want to know where all that money comes from?... it's the middle class. The overworked heart medication, prozac popping dual income homes that are just scrapping by.  True, but at least we're not potentially paying with our lives, being sent off to pointless wars in hostile countries that don't even want our fucking help.  Just think, if there weren't people dumb, desperate or patriotic enough to serve in our armed forces while we prance about the world playing karma police, they'd end up with a draft.  We really, *really* don't want that.  &gt; Who*se* taxes are being used to fund the military and their large families?  Everyone who pays out income tax, and I'm sure that includes Chick-Fil-A franchisees.  &gt; No, Chick-fil-A isn't a mom and pop shop trying to promote their business within the military market... they're doing something else entirely.  Well, Chick-Fil-A is not, you're right.  But I was under the impression that this particular store was franchised - as in, owned by a sole proprietor or limited liability partnership of private individuals - in which case, it is EXACTLY a mom-and-pop shop trying to promote their business within the military market.  &gt; They're a huge religious based business run by a family of Christians that are trying to spread their religion in this country . http://www.minyanville.com/special-features/articles/religious-ceos-s-truett-cathy-chickfila/5/19/2010/id/28281  This is true, and this is why I choose not to patronize their business.  And it sucks, because their chicken is actually good, even though they are way too in love with the pickle.  Too much pickle.  Way, way, way too much pickle.  On everything.  &gt; ""Prospective employees are screened on loyalty, wholesome values, and willingness to buy into the Christian credo. People who apply for an operator license are asked to disclose **[a bunch of shit that's illegal to require on an application for employment.]** According to the Forbes story, even though Cathy says that employees don’t have to be Christian to work at Chick-fil-A, they do have to base their work on biblical principles.""  &gt; So while ""employees"" don't have to be christains per *se*, ... franchise owners sure do. Just why is that ""iLoveFacebook""?  I'd actually like to hear the answer to this, but I'm going to deduce that this person is either a member of management, not of ownership, simply due to their ""tone of voice"" in their responses.  in which case, I doubt s/he'd have the clearance to defend their *boss*'s (or boss's boss's?) positions in politics or how they run their business, or how their franchisor runs their business.  I could be wrong, but if I am and ilovefacebook is the franchisee him/herself, I'd be very interested to the answer to this question.  I might be able to forgive the anti-GLBT positions of their patron and the gratuitous frequency of pickles to support a small business owner (and franchisees ARE small business owners) in my community.  &gt; While the military is pushing its people to convert and view themselves as ""christian warriors"" within their ranks. They're also getting free food for the ""Entire family"" while the rest of us have to pay for their overpriced junk... it all makes it look so very good to be a christian and to do what you're told nowdays.  1. It's always looked very good to be a Christian and do what you're told, especially if you're in the military. 2. Our military takes great strides, especially under this administration, to NOT look like they're fighting for the Lord Almighty™, because they're not.  In fact, we're fighting almost specifically against people who DO fight for (their perception of) the Lord Almighty™, as the only thing more dangerous than stupid fundamentalists is stupid fundamentalists with weapons and the willingness to use them on innocent people.  Just ask Spain in the 16th century.  &gt; It all adds up to a means of supporting and spreading their religion in this country. Maybe if Chick fil A stopped giving away so much food to the military, money to christian churches and even anti gay marriage efforts in this state... the rest of us wouldn't be charged so much for a side of fries? Hell, they might stop giving everyone sundays off and start working like regular business's do!  I'm perfectly fine with them subsidizing military personnel with food, as it boosts morale and it actually saves tax money because private funds are offsetting the cost of feeding the cannon fodder. (Not to say the monies saved aren't wasted elsewhere.)  In fact, I consider it honorable for any small business to literally support the military in this manner (I've seen them do it, they're literally throwing money away by giving away hundreds and hundreds of sandwiches; my pizza shack actually split a table with them at a go-to in October, I've seen this firsthand) - to actually reduce their profits for a greater good, however misguided you may feel they may be.  I also am cool with them taking Sundays off - that's a tradition lost in time; regardless of the reason I like it, especially since they like to hire people with reasons to have Sunday off, and by that I mean families, not church.  I've been working in food service for most of my adult life, and it'd be nice to have a guaranteed weekend day off once in a while! :D  tl;dr: Subsidizing the military in the way Chick-Fil-A does it is cool in my book.  Still think they should drop the homophobic banter.  Can't fault the franchisee for the actions of their higher-ups, but you're well within your rights to refuse to patronize their business.  For the most part, though, small businesses rule!",™

One of our single-most-trusted sources is our universities, and maybe the new york times and a few science journals, simply because of it's journalistic review and unbiased authoritative position. If you don't know the source there can be a lot of liberties taken with the material. If you know the source and they do have a bias, expect they are using it.  ie : [fhsc](http://www.sweetsurprise.com/) Do we trust this campaign? Why? They are quoting universities... We don't (or we shouldn't) trust them because of the editorial review. This is a big deal right now and it's important.  To answer your question if a university published it, I trust it more. If McDonald's publishes it, 'it is bought and paid for' because they have editorial review. They choose what is said, how, and by whom. That is the difference.   Furthermore, there are thousands of papers disregarding global warming, would I trust BP to tell me about those papers?",©

And everyone with a brain believes it anyway, but you guys have to keep re-making the same videos and posting the same talking points that you've been passing around for years to get the word out.   Well, I guess that isn't entirely fair, you guys do change things occasionally.

First off, I recommend getting the book, [A Pianist's Problems](http://www.amazon.com/Pianists-Problems-William-Newman/dp/0306802694), and reading Schumann's advice for young musicians [Download](http://www.mediafire.com/?uxts1yvw191qi4b) [Online Copy](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/28219/28219-h/28219-h.htm)  There are two paths you can choose.  You can choose to go through a tough rout of technique exercises, or play progressively harder pieces.  The first path is long, arduous, and tiring.  You will not sound good to yourself or anyone around you for several months at least. This path consists of plenty of scales, octaves, and technical exercise regimes to build technique, muscle memory, and strength.    Pros: * You'll be able to play some pretty beast stuff in the end  Cons: * You'll sound pretty terrible at first.  Risks:  * Tendinitis * Roommates gutting you and/or setting your piano on fire  Recommended Repertoire: [Czerny Practical Exercises for Beginners](http://imslp.org/wiki/Practical_Exercises_for_Beginners,_Op.599_%28Czerny,_Carl%29), [Czerny's ""The Young Pianist""](http://www.8notes.com/czerny.asp)  Later on, * ""100 Progressive Studies without Octaves"" Opus 139 (Levels 3-7) At a similar level to the above. You could add this one in after you have done the first few pieces in the above. Exercise 3 starts 8th notes and exercise 9 starts 16th notes, so it goes quite a bit faster than the above books.  * ""125 Exercises for Passage-Playing"" Opus 261 (Levels 8-10) * ""30 New Studies In Technics"" Opus 849 (Level 8)  The following books are for building advanced dexterity and velocity: * ""The Preliminary School of Finger-Dexterity"" Opus 636 (Level 9) * ""The School of Velocity"" Opus 299 (Levels 8-10) * ""The Art of Finger Dexterity"" Opus 740 (Level 10)  Then, the Hanon Exercises, and later on, the Liszt technical exercises.  The second route will also be long.  You might get some short term pleasure out of it though. This consists of playing progressively harder pieces, as opposed to lengthy technique regimes.  Pros: * You won't sound like a machine  Cons: * The pieces are simply terrible, usually  Risks: * Giving up, because you can't play what you want  Recommended: Music by the Fabers, specifically their [Accelerated Piano Adventures® for the Older Beginner](http://pianoadventures.com/publications/mainLibraries/pa/accelerated.html)   Either way, getting a teacher (a RL one, not some internet teacher) is highly, highly recommended.  There are many techniques of piano that can only be taught in person.  Practice tips:  * Play everything REALLY SLOWLY at first * play each piece a bit at a time, instead of all at once * Practice does not make perfect, perfect practice makes perfect. Play it slowly enough so that you can hit every not correctly. * If you or your hands get tired, take a water break  General Suggestions for Repertoire, by Period:  Baroque:  * [Bach, anna magdalena notebook](http://imslp.org/wiki/Notebooks_for_Anna_Magdalena_Bach_%28Bach,_Johann_Sebastian%29) * [Bach Inventions](http://imslp.org/wiki/15_Inventions,_BWV_772-786_%28Bach,_Johann_Sebastian%29) Classical: * [Fur Elise](http://imslp.org/wiki/F%C3%BCr_Elise,_WoO_59_%28Beethoven,_Ludwig_van%29)  Romantic:  * [Chopin Prelude in A (Opus 28, no 7, ""The Polish Dancer"")](http://imslp.org/wiki/Preludes,_Op.28_%28Chopin,_Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric%29)  Contemporary:  [Satie Gymnopedies](http://imslp.org/wiki/3_Gymnop%C3%A9dies_%28Satie,_Erik%29)",®

There are Jews around but they are in cars or just stopping in and leaving.

Government control over this sort of thing will ensure that ""no brand of cocaine shall ever be over 40% strength, and only corporations X and Y are allowed to sell it,"" creating, by force, a potentially inferior product (according to subjective consumer demand) and an artificially contracted supply, equating to higher prices for consumers (higher drug violence/theft), and higher profit margins for companies X and Y. As always, government uses guns and threats of violence to enforce these rules on consumers. I fail to see how this is more just, better, or safer than simply applying fraud laws to companies who sell a particular product.

ADMINISTRATION OF AMPHETAMINES FOR PROLONGED PERIODS OF TIME MAY LEAD TO DRUG DEPENDENCE AND MUST BE AVOIDED. PARTICULAR ATTENTION SHOULD BE PAID TO THE POSSIBILITY OF SUBJECTS OBTAINING AMPHETAMINES FOR NON-THERAPEUTIC USE OR DISTRIBUTION TO OTHERS, AND THE DRUGS SHOULD BE PRESCRIBED OR DISPENSED SPARINGLY.  &gt; MISUSE OF AMPHETAMINE MAY CAUSE SUDDEN DEATH AND SERIOUS CARDIOVASCULAR ADVERSE EVENTS.   ... also ...  &gt; ADDERALL® is a Schedule II controlled substance. Amphetamines have been extensively abused. Tolerance, extreme psychological dependence, and severe social disability have occurred. There are reports of patients who have increased the dosage to levels many times higher than recommended. Abrupt cessation following prolonged high dosage administration results in extreme fatigue and mental depression; changes are also noted on the sleep EEG. Manifestations of chronic intoxication with amphetamines include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity, and personality changes. The most severe manifestation of chronic intoxication is psychosis, often clinically indistinguishable from schizophrenia.    And for those who would prefer to avoid PDFs... from the [Wikipedia entry on Adderall](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adderall):     &gt; Like other powerful stimulant drugs, such as methamphetamine and cocaine, Adderall directly affects the mesolimbic reward pathway in the brain. Because of this, Adderall has a relatively high potential for abuse and addiction, especially if the drug is misused.  EDIT: Just a quick note on the group of controlled substances Adderall falls into. Schedule II is the highest category at which drugs may be prescribed, and includes drugs like Oxycodone, Opium, Morphine, and PCP.",®

""Pay slightly less than full price for a game which isn't finished, with no concrete idea of what the final product will be beyond our vision for it"".   Project Zomboid has a brilliant idea for a game, but so does every /r/zombies subscriber who has ever said ""I wish they'd make an MMO based around zombies"". As we're seeing though, this brilliant idea's reality is a bunch of unforeseen delays (including a car-bomb) mixed with the vague promise of something *soon™* that's actually worded as ""curb your enthusiasm"" on their website.   A vague promise is nice if it's honoured in the end, but this isn't two friends trading gameboy games. This is a business, and at that a business which doesn't have the infrastructure in place to secure against problems that have happened to many people before them. Creative Assembly gave a vague promise with the release of Empire: Total War, a multiplayer grand campaign which was my entire reason for buying it, and almost three years later it still isn't implemented because they'd rather make mediocre sequels than make good on their promise.   When you blindly hand money to companies without the thing you're paying for and without knowing the quality of the final product, you're basically handing the key to your house to a stranger because they say they've got a great recipe for cup cakes.

It's actually no surprise that 3DRealms went out of business.

This trailer in question was a bit shit but oh well. * A huge 2 to 3 minute gameplay trailer using the Unreal 1.0 engine. Hell, if that version went gold and was released, DNF would have probably been GOTY or GOTD easily. * Several low resolution screenshots of the game in its current incantation, as a poorly thought out ""teaser"" for the fans who long awaited the game's release. * A really short and crap teaser trailer. * Continued announcements where the release date was set at.... **When it's done™**",™

t5_2r2jt,Shaper_pmp,1306313963,"&gt; To me, Forever Alone is about your inability to form a relationship with someone, not your ability to get laid.  I think that's the *difference* between the stereotypical female and male FAs, though.  Most male FAs I know would give their right arm just to get laid, and here you are (either a female FA, or at least speaking on behalf of them) basically saying ""who cares about sex - I want a relationship"".  To most male FAs (to whom casual sex is practically a best-case scenario, and actual *regular* sex in a *caring relationship* a distant fever-dream) that just reinforces the stereotype that women can get all the sex they want - after all, male FAs are gagging for sex because they can't get it, and guys who are getting it generally aren't gagging for it.  So when women post regarding female FAs and dismiss or downplay the lack-of-sex angle, all they assume is that the woman *can* get sex (ie, isn't a ""real"" FA by their standards), but is jaded by its availability and wants more.  If you can't get sex *or* a relationship, obviously you're going to be less sympathetic to someone who *apparently* gets all the sex they want (or at least isn't particularly bothered by its absence), and is now complaining about the lack of a relationship.  I think it's simply a miscommunication rather than a justified judgement, but I think to the male FAs these kinds of conversations come off to them a little like someone with ginger hair complaining to a black guy in the Deep South about prejudice. &lt;:-)  TL;DR:  1. Male FAs generally can't get sex *or* a relationship (where sex is desired, but a genuine lasting relationship is considered even better). 2. Obviously guys who *are* getting plenty of sex aren't vocally bothered by its absence, so male FAs assume that ""being unbothered by sex"" = ""getting all the sex you want"". 3. So when women claim to be FAs but aren't overly bothered by sex, male FAs assume they can get sex easily and dismiss them as not ""real"" (or at least, not as serious) FAs.  (Disclaimer: Not a male FA, but I have several friends who are on the spectrum, and one who's - despite my best efforts - sliding dangerously close to becoming a Nice Guy™)",™

t5_2r2jt,Shaper_pmp,1306315686,"&gt; Male FAs can get the relationship without the sex. It's called friendzone.  Not really - most friend-zoned guys I know (as opposed to actual *friends*) tend to be expected to give all the emotional support of a relationship, but frequently get little or no support back - sometimes not even basic respect.  Friend-zoning is the female-&gt;male equivalent of frat-boys inviting insecure but ""easy"" girls to parties so they can use them for sex and then kick them out in the morning - it's not an equal, reciprocal relationship so much as a parasitic, one-sided one.  This is why girls who are used for sex in this way often end up with a crappy opinion of men, and why friend-zoned guys often end up as passive-aggressive, cryptomisogynist Nice Guys™ - at some level they know they're being abused and taken advantage of, and that subconscious resentment has to be expressed somehow.  They can't blame the specific person doing it to them because that would just highlight how silly they are to keep going back for more, so instead they generalise it and blame it on the entire gender (thereby also neatly avoiding any question of simply giving up the object of their infatuation/addiction, because ""all Xs are the same""). :-(  Basically, male FAs aren't seeing women who can only get sex as someone who can only get ""used"" for sex (as in the example above) - they're seeing them as someone who *can* get casual sex but if they want it, but not a relationship... versus the male FA who can't get either.  In my experience, most male FAs would give their right arm to be ""used"" for sex, so it's not surprising (though I don't entirely share the sentiment) they're unsympathetic to women who *could* get no-strings-attached sex if and when they wanted it, but can't get a relationship.  Basically you can only be ""used"" for sex if you're looking for something more than casual sex.  Conversely, society teaches sensitive, socially-awkward guys to emotionally ""put out"" at a moment's notice, and not to ask for anything back.  TL;DR: There's an added dimension here - that of reciprocation.  In my experience most ""friend-zoned"" guys (as opposed to merely ""friends"") aren't given as much emotional support and validation as they provide, making the relationship unequal.  It's the equivalent of a guy literally *using* a girl for sex - taking what he wants with no thought as to her enjoyment or satisfaction.  If he's considerate and reciprocal and up-front but doesn't want a relationship then I'd say it's ""casual sex"" rather than ""using"", just like if the ""friend-zoning"" woman is equally considerate and supportive of her male friend (and doesn't start flirting with him to keep his attention when other girls come into the picture) she's not really friend-zoning him so much as just *being a friend*.",™

They're the male equivalent of the ""easy"" girl who puts out after two drinks because she thinks that's the best way to land a boyfriend, but who just gets taken advantage of by inconsiderate, selfish guys, and who ends up with a really bad attitude regarding ""guys in general"", instead of the assholes she's been attracting.

t5_2r2jt,Shaper_pmp,1306323901,"&gt; It almost sounds like he's doing penance for some wrong he perceives he has done  Not at all - he just sounds like someone who's been raised in a society that increasingly teaches young guys that asserting themselves risks being arrogant, and asserting themselves sexually risks being perceived as a creeper, molester or potential rapist.  We're a much more enlightened society these days, and we're also more aware of how women were oppressed and subjugated and dismissed in the past.  That's lead to an entirely appropriate cultural backswing against that trend, but in some ways we've taken it too far - the [Father Knows Best](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatherKnowsBest) media trope has been made all but extinct by the [Bumbling Dad](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BumblingDad) one (warning: TV Tropes links - kiss goodbye to your afternoon), and in reacting against the ""swashbuckling pork swordsman"" view of masculinity, we risk teaching the most receptive members of the audience to be *too* sensitive and non-sexual, to the point many young guys slip into being passive, submissive and (at least in their outward presentation) practically asexual.  Basically, at its most extreme, sensitive young guys are learning to associate somewhat their own *normal sexuality and desires* with being a predator or misogynist or abuser, and that's not healthy.  I've known people with the Boy Scout attitude the OP has - hell, as a sensitive, thoughtful guy raised in the present generation I used to *be* like it when I was younger.  However, after several years of basically acting like an emotional doormat and being taken advantage of by insecure, selfish partners looking for validation, I learned the hard way that it's not wrong to throw off a bit of that social programming and learn to live for yourself, at least a little bit.  However, that realisation was *hard*; you don't throw off twenty-plus years of social programming in a short space of time, or without significant emotional turmoil.  In my personal case it took nearly 5 years of constantly being taken advantage of on a daily basis by a manipulative, insecure and self-centred partner, and I strongly resisted every piece of advice I was given by outsiders to rein it in a bit and live for myself more, because it seemed indistinguishable to me from ""being a selfish asshole"".  TL;DR: No remorse is necessary, just an upbringing that (for understandable sociological reasons) has over-emphasised submissiveness and supportiveness and de-emphasised assertiveness and confidence, until the recipient loses any ability to differentiate between ""arrogant"" and merely ""assertive"", or between ""being supportive to people you care about who deserve it"" and ""being an emotional doormat who lets pretty much anyone wipe their feet on them"".  As an aside, this is also the reason we have such a plague of passive-aggressive Nice Guys™ these days - because they've been raised to believe if they throw themselves down in front of women's doors and paint welcome on their chest it will make them more attractive to women, when in fact it just invites people to walk all over them, which causes resentment and cognitive dissonance, which they relieve by blaming ""women"" for not being the way they were brought up to expect, rather than society or their parents for raising them with unrealistic, over-simplified expectations in the first place, or *individual partners* for selfishly taking advantage of their naivety.",™

t5_2r2jt,Shaper_pmp,1306326282,"&gt; blame-all-women-for-their-loneliness is often part of the definition of ""forever alone  You're confusing ""Forever Alone"" with ""[Nice Guys™](http://restructure.wordpress.com/2008/12/05/nice-guy-tm-at-xkcd/)"".  Forever Alone is just someone who can't get a date - they may be introverted, socially awkward, or just largely asexual (although there's an implication that they're not entirely *happy* about being alone - that it's not entirely by choice).  Nice Guys™ are guys who spent too long trailing around after one or more objects of infatuation, throwing themselves in front of insecure, manipulative girls' doors and painting ""welcome"" on their chests, and then acting surprised and resentful when these people treat them like doormats.  This resentment builds up over time, but clearly it can't be aimed at the object of their infatuation, because that would necessitate *not trailing around after them and being their ""fwiend""* (which would mean even *less* female attention of *any* kind in their life, at least initially), and might lead to uncomfortable self-critical thoughts like ""well if they're such a bitch, why the hell did you spend so long trailing around after then like a little lost puppy, you fucking halfwit?"".  The causes cognitive dissonance, which the Nice Guy™ relieves by blaming ""women"" *in general*.  He's nice to ""women"", and ""women"" won't fuck him.  Of course in reality he's *submissive* to *one* (or a handful of) women, and that stops them and any other women wanting to go anywhere near him romantically or sexually, but psychological defence mechanisms and justifications are often pathetically flimsy and easy to see through from the outside.  TL;DR: No, Forever Alone means ""unable to get female companionship or romantic/sexual attention"".

Satoshi Kanazawa's work is not science, by any meaning of the term, and his column in *Psychology Today* is not a personal blog.  The article in question was offensive not only because of its cultural ramifications, but because it is *entirely spurious*; it would have been impossible for a man with his training to accidentally make the kinds of grossly incompetent errors which define the entire piece.  The fact that his findings are intentional insulting towards a particular cultural group becomes highly relevant when you consider that *it's not the result of science*.  So, if you just want to rage about feminists and women being emotional instead of logical, by all means enjoy yourself.  But this is a case of a trained scientist publishing a highly inflammatory racist opinion piece, for no apparent reason other than to raise controversy, and defending his opinions with the misapplication of scientific analysis to a largely irrelevant dataset.  I would like to see Kanazawa fired from everything, not because my feelings are hurt by his article, but because he cheapens science-- and specifically the field of evolutionary psychology-- by consistently misusing his position as an Official Scientist™ to publish increasingly incoherent, increasingly indefensible personal prejudices in a format that lay readers will understandably believe to be the result of the scientific method.  He'd probably fly under the radar if his findings weren't controversial, but he'd be no less of a fraud.  And he doesn't want to fly under the radar; he wants controversy and popular acclaim.",™

The following was provided by an AK expert gunsmith:""I recommend to all users of such a rifle to stop using commercial Sellier&amp; Bellot 7.62x54r and any other heavy ball such as the Bulgarian, Russian or German 54r. The rifle is not designed to EFFECTIVELY handle such rounds and almost everyone having problems that I have seen and fixed in the shop were due to shooting this stuff. They just beat the living hell out of those bolts even with the pin relief cut-out in the rear trunion. The gun is designed to use a STANDARD military 54r with a 147-158 grn bullet. This is a safe range of the 54r standard round to go by when using this rifle. I own a PSL and have never had one problem with it. It is a joy to shoot, quite accurate and the long stroke gas system is surprisingly smooth. I have fixed a wide array of problems for many people, but I must admit that more often than not they were brought on by the operator. Trust me, I have seen some screwy things fall out of the inside of the bolt assembly which I could write pages on, some really hysterical.  Don't get me wrong, I don't want to deter anyone from enjoying their PSL. Just follow this advice, and you should be fine:  1. Use military 7.62x54r ball  2. Keep the inside of the bolt well lubricated (Breakfree® is good)  3. Keep your internal trigger components lubricated and free of residue.""   (source: http://www.dragunov.net/psl_ammo.html )",®

They really should step up on the gas, though. But I digress...  It's not even about the names themselves, but the mindset they invoke. Those roads and highways were never made to have a ""fast lane"" and a ""slow lane"". They have a ""passing lane"" and a ""driving lane"". When you think of them like having a ""fast"" and a ""slow"" lane, this influences your driving behavior subconsciously for worse.  It is frustrating as fuck, rightly so, when there's three cars on a three-lane highway pulling a on-time-for-work-clockblock on you. But even if all three would be driving at the speed limit, the left-most car is still performing an illegal maneuver; He is technically blocking others from passing the cars on the driving lane, despite that nobody should even want to pass them if they drive at proper speed.  **TL;DR: There's more to this than semantics, it influences your behaviour on the road too.**",®

t5_2rjz2,ImatWork86,1306447726,"Haven't read the books but I love this show so much I was driven to write a review of EPISODE 7. NO SPOILERS.   You can't back away from your duty. This was the first rule put forth by Game of Thrones in the opening minutes of its premiere. Even staring into the eyes of evil will not excuse you of the path you chose to walk. In this weeks episode ""You Win, Or You Die,"" our characters deal with the moment of transformation (John Snow takes the Black in front of the 'Old Gods', Dhrogo vows to cross the poison sea to avenge his love while the dharthraki chant his son's name), after these moments it's clear that these characters' lives are never going to be the same. We also saw more of the old yarn, 'be careful what you wish for' something Viserys found out last episode when he died the best TV death in history. Westeros is a land where the paths of: glory, title and honor; ensnare many who are not fit to walk it, and the dirt is thick with their blood. Littlefinger learned this the hard way, caught up by the dreams of honor; he was cut down and spared because of the same naivety. Men like Ned Stark walk tall this land and lecture kings without repose. But what is honorable about a land where a child rules on the iron throne and kings are killed by pigs? Overnight the landscape has changed and now Ned Stark limps into halls filled with backstabbers. It is in this world where Littlefinger walks taller than a Stark, and can finally get his revenge for the scars; physical and emotional, Nedâ€™s brother left on him. Littlefinger knows what Tywin knows, knows what that poor knight from last week knew as he fell through the moon door; On the ground, the path of honor is usually the shortest path there is. ` And as we reach episode seven one episode away from our first GRRM written episode, ""Game of Thrones"" has already set up everything it's viewers need to know for the rest of this possible seven (?) season series; no one is safe. honor will get you killed, some of our characters, if not most of them, are not being true to their nature and will pay the price for it and most importantly Winter is Coming. Those who are tired of boring TV and are ready to be challenged by their stories, challenged to pay attention, to care for characters whom may be murdered before our very eyes, challenged to be patient for what is sure to be a fantastic television experience will find themselves ""creatively satisfied"" for the first time in a long while. Everyone else will continue to watch True Blood and Real Wives of Orange County.  TLDR: Game of Thrones is amazing!!",™

t5_2rp0r,runiq,1306453516,"&gt; the sad reality is that barefoot running is promoted as backed by fucking studies, unlike shod running which is [...] without any science to back it up. So when you have that, you tell me about it and I'll go out and buy the most expensive Nike I can find. But until then, no thanks.  Eh, I don't know. I wasn't really able to procure much research on barefoot running besides the usual Lieberman *et al.* stuff everyone's been throwing around over the last months/years, and the little disclaimer at the bottom of the lab's site had me a little worried: *Research presented on this site was funded by Harvard University and, in part, by Vibram USA®.* Of course, this doesn't necessarily mean that Prof. Lieberman advocates running in minimalist shoes exclusively (or at all, for that matter), but it should teach us to have a closer look even at the little bit of primary research that exists on the matter.

Keeping a multiplayer platform alive is a great way to make money, though. In the case of Blizzard, having people, even people who aren't the first sale, use battle.net is a huge boon for them.

t5_2shbr,patienceinbee,1306527984,"&gt;We have TDOR for those who have been lost, which is both respectful to the victims and the loved ones they left behind as well as informative to those who want to listen and learn.  Well, here are two reasons: 1) the TDoR isn't getting through to a mainstream audience, and 2) its scope erases people with transsexual bodies.  Likewise, ""Transgender Menace"" is a dud, as was ""Transexual Menace"" prior to that.  &gt;If it did only get worse for all of us, then why are we here?  Well, we ought to ask the trans people who haven't made it (well wait, we can't, but maybe the deceased survivors could); or trans people who are left with little other income source beyond survival sex work under the table (and doing so without correct identity paperwork, thus barring them from over-the-table employment).    For those of us who are here and privileged to have this discussion, we have been lucky in varying counts — some more than others.  But ""lucky"" doesn't get a lot of us on par with our cis counterparts.  Increasingly, our cis queer counterparts are confronting diminishing returns of backlash for being out(ed); we, however, are not.  And that's a bona fide problem.  The goal of this kind of project is to draw together the stark, correlative (and even causal) relationships between the manner by which a lot of trans people are being functionally excluded, institutionally obstructed, legally left out, and the manner by which they are still very much socially pressed to the margins (thereby negatively impacting life chances) — just as a particular It Gets Better™ campaign erases those whose voices are drowned out for stepping up and saying, ""Uhm, it isn't actually getting better.""  Chrissy Lee Polis might have a thing or two to say about that, provided that her voice actually counts for something.  [And because I have been informed by you that you may not be a fan of trans women writ large, blackshire — as apparently all of us are your ipso facto oppressors, per [the last discussion](http://www.reddit.com/r/QueerTransmen/comments/hgjgo/can_i_get_174_person_group_hug/c1vbziz) or [the one before](http://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/hfkxl/dae_wish_there_was_a_secret_codeword_we_could_use/c1v1djv) — I should step back and out of the way to see if a guy around here might be able to pick up this relay baton (there's no ""I"" in ""team"", except in Québec's *l'équipe*).

But I didn't think to check if the new sandybridge was triple channel or dual, the old I7 was triple. I've always skimped on memory so I thought I'd really go all in this time, obviously not the best idea without checking properly.

Neither, actually. The word 'LEGO', when used as a noun, should only refer to the company that makes the product. Otherwise 'LEGO' is supposed to be used as an adjective. Thus, when referring to the pieces, neither 'lego' nor 'legos' is correct... rather one should say: 'LEGO bricks' or 'LEGO pieces' or whatever (using LEGO as an adjective -- and one should really capitalize all of the letters, and put the little 'circle-R' symbol after it (®)). This is all a matter of protecting the trademark of 'LEGO' for the company (using it otherwise degenerates the strength of the trademark). This is not to say that I use the word correctly 100% of the time... but that's the answer to the question (it's always fun/painful to read the near-flame-wars that start at slashdot.org over this topic... and generally, both sides are wrong).

You are really unlikely to discover a bike with Deore XTR, but if you come across one with XT ot LX components look very closely, those are the sleeper models, and people often don't realize how high a level of components they really are.   Be aware that for a couple of years, Shimano made gear-shifters that had both the up and down triggers on the same side of the shifter, one below the other, facing toward the rider. This requires the rider to be able to distinguish between these two tiny levers, while bouncing around. This was a poor design, and results in many wrong shifts. Not so bad when you wanted to up-shift, and accidentally downshifted. Really frustrating though, when you want to put it into an easier gear as you are running out steam on a hill, and accidentally put it into a harder gear. This breaks chains, actually. Avoid this dsign. You want the *Rapid-Fire Plus* models that locate the triggers on opposite sides so that there is no confusing them.   From the late, great, [Sheldon Brown's Shimano Page](http://www.sheldonbrown.com/shimano.html)   *RF ® - RapidFire ® Shimano's first ""below the bar"" shifting system, early '90s. It used two buttons operated by the rider's thumb, one for upshifting, one for downshifting. This caused confusion since the ushifting and downshifting motion was done with the same digit, in the same direction.*  *RF+ ®- RapidFire Plus ® Successor to RapidFire, used a thumb button to select a larger sprocket/chainring, and an index-finger ""trigger"" to select a smaller one. This solved the ergonomic problems of the original RapidFire, and remains Shimano's flagship shifting system for upright handlebars.* ",®

Oh, so members shouldn't be confrontational with family members that aren't members or believers? Even if it is for ""reaching one's potential"" as a ""celestial family"" forever?  &gt; 2) Imitate sacred rites or ceremonies.  Oh, right. Mormons never imitate. Except when told, ""Do as I'm doing"" in all sorts of rituals that are mostly borrowed imitations themselves.  &gt; 3) Foster physical contact among participants.  Whew, I guess that cuts out that part of the Endowment ceremony then. Also baptism by immersion, priesthood blessings, ordinations, and all sorts of Churchy® things.  &gt; 4) Meet late into the evening or in the early-morning hours.  Following this would cut: 4:30am temple visits—like when we went as part of youth groups—early morning seminary, night institute classes, EFY, and all sorts of youth activities.  &gt; 5) Encourage open confession or disclosure of personal information normally discussed only in confidential settings.  Fast and testimony meeting anyone? It seems that most members spill the beans for all sorts of personal information that they would not do elsewhere. Also, don't worry about meetings with bishops. Meeting with bishops is completely confidential... until they talk to other people about it.  &gt; 6) Cause a husband and wife to be paired with other parties.""

One way I thought I dealt with the exact same issue was ‘alone time’ it’s not dealing with it at all its just distancing your self from ever really dealing with it.   The thing about her not being able to fully commit, sounds to me just to be a sense of control, having been in a situation where you have none, to have final say on a commitment would feel somewhat comforting to her perhaps. I wouldn't see this as a problem if I were you, you are together, in a serious relationship, you are both aware. What’s the need to make things ‘official’ for everyone else?  Regarding the letter I think this is a really good way to communicate, it has worked for me. So be open and honest before giving it to her, make it her decision. Explain you have been unsure how to approach the situation and that the letter might make her sad, but I would say you want to be there with her (at least in the same house) if she wants to be alone to read it that’s fine, but be there for her for when she needs a cuddle afterwards.  The not deserving to be loved bit – tell her all the time how much you love her, when she’s doing things you love point them out. Make her blush ☺ even the silly things. If she wears make-up tell her how beautiful she is without it and how absolutely stunning she is with it on. Tell her you love her for the person she is on the inside, don’t be shy with it.. A past SO of mine did this for me – he was basically teaching me to love myself, which in the end was the best thing anyone has ever done for me.    Throwaway-o really? Why not? Maybe because helping others, generally being a nice guy rather then a dick will get you much further in life. In fact to anyone who’s said ‘she’s broken’ ‘needs to be fixed’ come on, a lot of the time people who have been through the shit, are stronger, more well rounded humans. They have seen the floors in humanity and as a result are often charitable and caring then the rest of us.

PleaseH3lpM3 she told you about her past, this means she is dealing with it, she is 80% ‘fixed’ it may take time, time if you are there for her during the process, it wont back fire such as cheating or self destruction.

I also have problems with how birth control has been used to prevent ""undesirables"" from having children. I don't have to take my history as a morality play. I understand there have been contradictions and hypocrisies in the past just as there are today, even among people, organizations and movements I admire.   I was just acknowledging that even something I consider an active force for good in the world (birth control) can be used for ill.  On a a bit of a side note, I was delighted to learn about [Silphium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silphium) last year. ♥'s are even better now...   &gt;It absolutely is, though.

t5_2fwo,kidjan,1306861964,"TL;DR Sadly, the best method I've found for solving nasty memory bugs is brute force.  Tools can help, but really shitty stuff typically doesn't fall out of the woodwork so easily.  1. Go through all classes and make sure every member variable is initialized correctly. Value types should be set to sensible values, pointer types should be initialized to NULL. 2. Search for all new/delete/malloc/free statements.  Ensure that all pointer values that are allocated begin their life as NULL. Ensure that the memory being released is immediately NULL'd. Ensure you have no new/free or malloc/delete mismatches. Ensure you do not free/delete memory twice. Ensure that any memory allocated by a third party library is also destroyed by that library (i.e. do not call ""CrazyLibraryMemAlloc"" and use free/delete to clean up unless you are positive that is the correct thing to do). Make sure your destructors and cleanup methods release all memory and NULL everything. Make sure you're using delete[] if the type was allocated with new []. In essence, everything should begin its life as NULL and end its life as NULL. This is probably the single best thing you can do to isolate memory tom-foolery. 3. Review every memset, memcpy and mem-whatever in the program (ditto for Win32 variants like CopyMemory). If you are using raw buffer pointers (e.g. void*, int*, etc.), consider wrapping them in something like QByteArray. Review any and all string handling code (in particular, strcpy and the likes). If you have any raw pointer string types, consider replacing them with a decent string class like CString or Qt's QString. 4. Are you using threads? Does the crash happen in a shared object? If so, this strongly implies your locking strategy (or lack thereof--even if you have locks, be absolutely certain they are working as you expect). 5. Determine if you are experiencing corruption in the same location, or if it's more random. If it's random corruption, then it is more likely to be a buffer overflow. If it's localized corruption (i.e. let's say the crash always happens in a shared queue, or in the same place in code), then it is more likely that code touching the shared item is invalid. If it crashes in the exact same place always, then you are in luck--you should be able to watch that location in a debugger and break on any read/write. Whether or not you have crashes in the same place is a huge, huge clue about your problem. Track this information religiously. 6. One method for determining if you have local/random corruption is to declare ""no man's land"" buffers directly above and below the item being corrupted. Like, nice, big 10k buffers that are initialized to ""0xDEADBEEFDEADBEEFDEADBEEF..."" When your program crashes, inspect those buffers. If those buffers contain invalid data, then it is not localized corruption. If they aren't corrupted, but the data structure they wrap is, then that strongly implies something that touches the sandwiched object is where the problem may lie. 7. It is not likely to be the C-runtime, third party code, obscure linking issues, etc. Think about it: you're not the only person using these libraries and tools. They are generally more thoroughly vetted because of Linus' law. Is it possible? Yeah, sure, anything's possible. But is it likely? Not really. 8. Unless evidence strongly implies otherwise, assume the issue is in your code. This is good, because it means it's something you can potentially fix. Otherwise, you may have to start a support case with whomever owns the code. If it's an open source project, you might get a quick response (or possibly no response at all...). If it's somebody like MSFT, it is going to take weeks at a minimum. Only as a last resort should you assume it's somewhere else, and be certain you have Real Information™ to backup your theory.",™
