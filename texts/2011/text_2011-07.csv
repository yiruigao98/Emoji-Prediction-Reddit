While on a European buying trip, John E. Brooks, the grandson of our founder, observed that polo players had cleverly anchored their collars to their shirts by means of buttons, thus keeping their collars from flying into their faces during gameplay. Inspired by what he saw, he came back to Brooks and introduced the original Polo Button-Down to America that same year, thereby changing the face of menswear forever.  IMO, thats akin to a Strauss adding rivets to his dungarees.",¬Æ

t5_2s4k5,UnrealMonster,1309485094,"Lets see Integrated Intel¬Æ GMA HD, [this page](http://www.notebookcheck.net/Intel-Graphics-Media-Accelerator-HD.23065.0.html) shows some benchmarks for this, which seems to be quite hit and miss, it can play some games on medium on others it can't even run on low.     Honestly i'm not sure about how viable it is for low level gaming, but wouldn't you rather fork over a little more and get something that can play on medium or higher? It's your choice at the end of the day, but in my view it's worth considering.     Either way i'd recommend one of the latest i3 or i5 sandy bridge processors (i7 is more the ¬£600 range) as you can get them cheap and they're new hardware which is more efficient, and well, better. I'm not too sure on AMD if you choose to go that route but remember it's not all about clock speeds, efficiency plays a part.    Whatever you choose to get, look up some reviews for it and look at some benchmarks for it, it should give you a good idea of whether or not it'll play what you want.  Edit: [This](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Acer-Notebook-i3-370M-Mobility-Wireless/dp/tech-data/B0045UBCSU/ref=de_a_smtd) looks like a good laptop and it's got a discrete graphics card, Benchmarks [here](http://www.notebookcheck.net/ATI-Mobility-Radeon-HD-5470.23698.0.html), as you can see it's a lot better for games and can play pretty much anything on low. **You can probably find something cheaper and better, this was just a quick search I did, feel free to look around.**  Also, I am the same person as who you replied to.",¬Æ

t5_2qh3p,wtf_advice,1309529326,"You should probably choose a REALTOR¬Æ. First off, the term ""REALTOR¬Æ"" is a registered collective membership mark that identifies a real estate professional who is a member of the NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS¬Æ and subscribes to its strict Code of Ethics (which in many cases goes beyond state law). In most areas, it is the REALTOR¬Æ who shares information on the homes they are marketing, through a Multiple Listing Service (MLS). Working with a REALTOR¬Æ who belongs to an MLS will give you access to the greatest number of homes.   A REALTOR¬Æ is held to an even higher standard of conduct under the NAR‚Äôs Code of Ethics. In recent years, state laws have been passed setting up various duties for different types of agents. As you start working with a REALTOR¬Æ, ask for a clear explanation of your state's current regulations, so that you will know where you stand on these important matters.   In making your decision to work with an agent, there are certain questions you should ask when evaluating a potential agent. The first question you should ask is whether the agent is a REALTOR¬Æ . You should then ask:  - Does the agent have an active real estate license in good standing? To find this information, you can check with your state‚Äôs governing agency.  - Does the agent belong to the Multiple Listing Service (MLS) and/or a reliable online home buyer‚Äôs search service? Multiple Listing Services are cooperative information networks of REALTORS¬Æ that provide descriptions of most of the houses for sale in a particular region.  - Is real estate their full-time career?  - What real estate designations does the agent hold?  - Which party is he or she representing--you or the seller? This discussion is supposed to occur early on, at ""first serious contact"" with you. The agent should discuss your state's particular definitions of agency, so you'll know where you stand.  - In exchange for your commitment, how will the agent help you accomplish your goals? Show you homes that meet your requirements and provide you with a list of the properties he or she is showing you?   If you have a realtor, this *menage a trois* will probably go very well for you.",¬Æ

When we got to the airport HB10 was as friendly as normal. All 10 of us from the class that were flying back to Seattle grabbed lunch, and after lunch she asked if I wanted to play cards. We proceeded to play Egyptian war for about an hour per her request 1 v 1 while everyone else just chilled around us on other seats. At this point I was feeling good because we were interacting in the same positive/fun manner as before we hooked up.   Unfortunately we didn‚Äôt have seats next to each other on the flight, but that was fine because I slept the whole way‚Ä¶ I had gotten so little sleep the last couple nights and the limited amount I did get was terrible. Once we landed in Seattle I asked her and the gay dude if they wanted a ride back to their houses because I had drove and they had taken cabs originally. They both accepted. On the drive home I asked them if they wanted to grab dinner (I had no groceries in my house and didn‚Äôt want to do any work that night). The gay dude had plans already, but HB10 accepted. So we dropped him off and headed to her house since she lives downtown in the city. Once there, she changed and we headed out to a nice / somewhat classy joint.   During dinner our conversation was primarily focused on deeper topics such as family members, which lead to discussion about the death of her father a couple years ago, dating with age gaps, her 7 year relationship she had gotten out of a few months ago, and our future career plans etc in relation to whether we would stay with this firm or work somewhere else. Based on this conversation I felt pretty strongly that this girl isn‚Äôt just a complete slut and is extremely intelligent (you have to be to be in our line of work), has some strong morale fiber, and has worked hard in her life). We left dinner and headed back to her apartment on foot (it was about 7 blocks). On the way back we bumped into each other, put our arms around each other for a bit, and then finally relinquished.   I really wanted to reach out and hold her hand, but was unsure because I felt like she was A) Really into me and it would be ok, or B) more likely that she was kind of in to me, but wasn‚Äôt ready for a ‚Äúclinger stage 9‚Äù just because we had hooked up. That second option may make her sound like slut in this FR, but I still don‚Äôt get that vibe. I honestly think I just ran perfect game on her up to this point and it would have been hard for any non-prude girl to say no (I don‚Äôt mean that to be bragging because I am a NEWB PUA, but this time it just clicked). We got back to her place and she invited me in to watch some TV. We hopped on the couch but resided not to drink since we had done so much over the last few days. While watching TV we were side by side again (arms, legs, hips touching), but I just felt weird putting my arm around her or holding her hand because I didn‚Äôt want to send any DLV spikes. I had played hard to get and demonstrated higher value / ‚Äúout of her league‚Äù vibes all week (which had gotten me the F-close‚Ä¶). I guess I just didn‚Äôt want to abandon those tactics even if I had already decided I wanted to pursue a relationship with this girl. After a couple hours I declared I should go so I could make it to work tomorrow (time constraint). Before I left I went to use her bathroom. When I came out she was in her bedroom. I couldn‚Äôt see exactly where (Should I have walked around the corner?) so I just called out, ‚ÄúHey I am taking off‚Äù. She walked to the front door and we exchanged a long 5ish second hug. Once again, I wanted to kiss her or something. FFS ‚Äì I had F-closed it the night before, but since in the morning when I kissed her on the cheek she didn‚Äôt try to initiate more‚Ä¶ I just didn‚Äôt want to push to hard. So I left.   Thursday 6/30: She invited me through email to a get together with a couple other co-workers on Friday. I told her yes and asked a few ‚Äúhow are you doing‚Äù type questions. She responded and continued the conversation. This went back a forth a few times with her sending the last message that night (she worked super late).  Friday 7/1: Our firm had this day off, but I got screwed and had to work it along with Saturday and Monday (the 4th) since our client has a tight deadline. However, I got the clearance with my boss to leave by 3pm to go meet up with ‚Äúfriends‚Äù (HB10). Since the intern wasn‚Äôt out on the firm holiday, I had to go grab donuts for the Client‚Äôs employees. On my walk over I texted HB10 and asked if I could leave my computer at her house before we went out with the friends (he house was near where we were headed). She called me a few seconds later and said, ‚ÄúHey, so another friend of mine invited me to the Oregon Coast for the weekend so I am going to cancel our plans‚Äù.   I am thinking FFS, I already bought tickets to the event. Instead of sounding pissy though and sending DLV spikes, I said, ‚ÄúOh that‚Äôs fine, no big deal. How are you going to return your tickets?‚Äù   She replied, ‚ÄúOh you bought your tickets? I haven‚Äôt yet‚Ä¶‚Äù At this point I am thinking WTF, this was locked down last night, but now she is tweaking stuff around‚Ä¶ almost like she is trying to push me through a hoop/compliance test (THIS could have been my first big mistake by accepting her invitation). For the record, She wasn‚Äôt a complete bitch about it though because while on the phone with me she called the event on her hardline phone (with me still on the cell in the other hand) and begged them to refund my money ‚Äì which they did. Once she finished that she struck up some casual conversation as I was walking back from the donut shop. I negged her about her phone and her groggly voice from lack of sleep, but all in all we had a nice 5 minute genuine phone call. Before I hung up (and I feel like this was my second big FUCKING mistake). Finally, I said ‚Äì well since I don‚Äôt get to drive out to the lake with my friends on the 4th since I am working, do you have any recommendations for doing the 4th in Seattle (I just moved here). She threw out some general options, but then said, ‚ÄúMy friends and I might go out on another friends boat OR we might watch the fireworks from my apartments rooftop. You can PROBABLY come to those, but you should just use them as a backup plan since I don‚Äôt know if there will be room on the boat or if we will come back to my place for sure‚Äù. I blew off that statement like it was no thing, but at that point I realized that this girl had started to take the power. Between scheduling and cancelling our event on Friday and then dangling a MAYBE you can come invite for the 4th ‚Äì I feel like I lost all momentum. I need help getting it back ‚òπ   So as you can see this is a beast of a FR, that is less flashy than my other, but I wanted to get some feedback on stuff I did right/wrong, and how I move forward. I love sarging, but this girl is incredible and I would like to not fuck it up. I can usually get a #, K, or F close‚Ä¶ but always after that for girls I am actually into‚Ä¶. I have trouble converting. Sigh‚Ä¶. Thanks fellow PUAers! ",‚òπ
t5_2qlqp,gfixler,1309596241,"The 4 main woods at my local Home Depot, and what I think of them:  **hard maple** - Pretty in a boring kind of way. It's very usefully predictable, so if you're making something and run out of wood, go back to the store and get another board, and it'll match fine. No real smell. Small heartwood (darker central wood) which you usually don't find visible in pieces from a store, though once in awhile I see one and snag it, like [this one](http://www.flickr.com/photos/garyfixler/3807806496/). I like the weird stuff. I sort through it at the store to find the stuff with a figure that'll pop a bit when finished. It can have a kind of holographic look, known as [chatoyance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatoyancy) in the woodworking world. Some finishes will completely kill that effect, like certain oils, while others, like shellac will bring it out in a big way.  **birch** - I have an exceedingly hard time telling this apart from maple very often. I've held pieces of each in my hand and looked them over, and while you can point to differences, you'll end up with 2 more pieces that are different in the opposite way. The best way I've found is smell. Scratch it a bit, or hit it with a saw or plane, and it smells like popsicle sticks, which are made of birch. I find birch to be more brittle and prone to little bits of tearout on the face than the hard maple I've used. I don't tend to reach for birch, though I find some [pretty, figured planks](http://www.flickr.com/photos/garyfixler/3179616786/) at the store from time to time, and must buy them.  **red oak**  - This is a true standard in furniture making here in the US, and as such, I've come to find it very boring. It does exactly what you expect (once you know it), and the end product is great. *Boooring* :) It has [huge, visible grain](http://www.flickr.com/photos/garyfixler/3807007853/). The little dark dashes running vertically up the whole board there are [medullary rays](http://www.kareliaparketti.com/karelia-us/pages/hardwood_floor_info/information_on_wood_and_hardwood_floors/medullary_ray_of_oak/), which are like thin, tall veins that run from the center of the tree radially out to just below the bark. If you flat saw - i.e. cut perpendicularly through the rays, and along the ring contours, you see cross sections of the rays. In oak they're huge, but in maple and other woods they're very tiny, or even invisible, or nearly so. If you quarter saw, wherein you're cutting mostly radially from the outside of the tree toward the center, you end up 'filleting' the rays, which in oak really exposes them at their largest dimension, as seen [here](http://nelsonwoodworks.biz/pb/wp_26e0a1ef/images/img11336485ab2f2dc06b.jpg) and [here](http://nelsonwoodworks.biz/pb/wp_26e0a1ef/images/img32417485ac7f9498a1.jpg). From a different angle, they'll reflect differently and appear darker than the wood. They shimmer a bit if the light source moves in relation to them. This wood has a sharp smell, akin to ammonia, but not. I find if I plane it, it stings my eyes like I've been cutting onions. Oh, and compared to many other woods I've used, it's hard as hell. I had been turning green wood on my larger wood lathe for awhile, and switched to [a square 3/4"" thick red oak piece](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noRNbCjH1Z8), and it was like my tools forgot how to cut wood. Quite a remarkable difference. The coolest piece of red oak I've found so far was a 1x3 with black streaking in it. I used it to make [a lazy susan](http://www.flickr.com/photos/garyfixler/sets/72157623466176555/with/4419431250/).  **poplar** - I don't mean *real* poplar (*Populus spp.*). I mean the tulip poplar (*Liriodendron tulipifera*) you get from a home center. No real smell. Very even, consistent wood. Hardness somewhere between pine and maple. Almost impossible to get a splinter from. Prone to mineral streaking, as seen in [these pieces](http://www.flickr.com/photos/garyfixler/3222537386/), which I quite like. It can be [quite pronounced](http://www.flickr.com/photos/garyfixler/3610789222/) ([backside](http://www.flickr.com/photos/garyfixler/3610794174/in/photostream/)) in purple, green, tan, and black. I search for those. I used that panel in [some shop cabinet doors](http://www.flickr.com/photos/garyfixler/3627341567/). The frames are a long 1x3 or 1x4 of maple I had to pick up, because it had brown, wormlike tracks running all through it. I still don't know what they are. They appear to be a natural occurrence in the tree, and not fungus or bugs. I still want to go back and relieve the hard lines in those doors a bit. There a tad too spartan for me.  I'll stop there, or I'll end up typing a small book :) I've worked with several other prepared woods, including alder, Mangaris‚Ñ¢ (red balau), walnut, pine, cedar, and white oak, and through finding fallen or felled trees all over LA, in a great number of logs of green wood, including modesto ash, paperbark, ficus, weeping bottlebrush, several kinds of eucalyptus, european olive, chinese elm, sweet gum, hollywood juniper, and jacaranda.  I also have a bit of a wood samples collection started with [this 30pc set](http://www.flickr.com/photos/garyfixler/sets/72157614063265111/with/3292894384/), which was a preselected assortment, and in the last pic there, you can see an additional box I ordered of particular samples I wanted. I'm planning to get all the samples from Woodworker's Source, but in batches of about 10. Having them on hand is like an artist or designer having color or material swatches on hand.  It's great to be able to see the grain, chatoyance, ray fleck, etc., and feel things like how soft, dry, oily, or dense the woods actually feel in real life. Online pics just don't do some of them justice, and you miss out on things like the end grain usually. There were wood pairings I had been considering as good contrasts or compliments of one another that in real life looked bad together, or would clearly be a bad matchup (i.e. a really soft, light wood and a really hard, dense wood that would be a nightmare to turn on the lathe as alternating pieces in a segmented bowl).  For awhile I've been hunting for 4 woods that would give me a nice set from dark to light, but whereas I can simply go for, say, wenge or some kind of ebony for really dark wood, and holly for the lightest wood (it's practically white), they don't at all fit the list of needs for most things. Say I'm making an end grain cutting board. Woods like red oak and wenge are right out, because they have enormous pores in their end grains, which are bacteria traps. Too, they're much too hard, and so are many others, but many woods are too soft as well. You need a board that doesn't hurt knives, and which knives won't quickly destroy. The Board Smith recommends [](http://www.theboardsmith.com/purchase.htm) woods with a [Janka Hardness](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janka_hardness_test) of 850 to 1600. A great number of woods fall outside of that. I've often heard bad things about exotics (i.e. African and South American jungle hardwoods), because some have somewhat nasty chemistry and oils going on in them. Some exotics that grow in more sandy soils will draw silica particles up all through the wood, and these woods will dull your knives, and the tools you used to make the board. A good example is [this Mangaris‚Ñ¢ cutting board](http://www.flickr.com/photos/garyfixler/sets/72157624283696223/). It's really just too hard for general use in a kitchen. Many other factors come into play as well in my wish for 4 distinct colors of wood - affordability, availability, non-endangered/protected status, and strong consistency of color from board to board and tree to tree all being pretty high in the list.  Two woods that work fantastically well as cutting boards and anything else you can think of, and have a strong contrast are maple and walnut. They're the classic chess board woods. I made my mother [this maple and walnut heart cutting board](http://lumberjocks.com/projects/25275). She said it was too nice to use, and I said it was probably for the best, because the maple was a softer maple. I made her a simpler [walnut and maple striped cutting board](http://www.flickr.com/photos/garyfixler/sets/72157625818387949/), which she reluctantly has been using. It's holding up great.",‚Ñ¢

t5_2qh03,Nienordir,1309650472,"One of the most overrated games of 2010. While I enjoyed the atmosphere and crazy character design, the actual gameplay has a few very frustrating flaws and 'road bumps', like..  * saving quickly, instead of having to find a suitable area, set up camp, waiting for the screen to load. (you could 'hack' a save by using a horse deed, but seriously why not place it into the menu..) * the lack of checkpoints (ride from on side of the map to the other, die and have to start on the other side again..or go through the annoying save procedure, that breaks the flow of the game). * non functional path finding (rarely did the game show the shortest route and the enviroment is to generic to find your way around).  A triple A title should be more polished than that, but the absolutely worst thing was the story. I can't recall another game that insulted my intelligence on this scale.  Marston was a cool guy and it kicks off great with a nice intro, you get shot and help on the farm, because you owe them your life, but boy does it take a nose dive after that. My theory is, Rockstar spent 2/3 of the available time on the open world and then figured out the main story only covers 5 hours, so they desperately scrambled for filler missions, but since they ran out of time they stuffed all of them onto the main story npcs.  Seriously _every_ npc does the same shit to you.. ""no dude, that's not how we roll, take it slow!"", ""yeah, I'm on it, but _first_ you gotta do me a favor.."", ""I haven't forgotten, don't push me..it needs time"". Everyone does it at least 3-4 times the marshall, the salesman, the graverobber. Oh, yeah that irish jerk, who _knows_ where the gun is, but you go to the wrong place, find it later, but then it doesn't have any bullets (of course not..why should it).  And you can't skip anything, because they're all linked to the main story. Then you get into Mexico and they do the same shit again, but it gets even worse because they only work from 11am-13pm (or whatever) and there is no way to skip time and those guys do even worse stuff to you. Finally you get into the Blackwater only to get ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• by the federal agents in the same way like every ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• npc before.  I just stopped caring about Marston, the story or anything else, it's nothing but a bad joke and probably one of the worst story&amp;mission design in the history of gaming. It wouldn't have been half that bad if they had put those missions into optional side quests or did a better job instead of having every ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• npc ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• you over in the same ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• pattern with the same ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• excuses.  Finally the ambient challenges, of course you have to do them all in order. Why would you unlock them all and give players the option to fulfill their requirements naturally while exploring the world. No, make the player backtrack through the whole world in a fixed pattern, it's not like you have to waste time between missions, because the npcs have a limited timeframe..

I would be a little concerned about the chemistry and biology because some of mandatory courses AHS courses with KIN and HLTH labels could get pretty science-y. HLTH 210 is human developmental biology and KIN 217 is biochemistry. Third year health courses include immunobiology and toxicology. Not to scare you off, though!

Sure, their beliefs are different. They have another book they claim is scripture. But are their beliefs that far different than some of the accepted branches of Christianity?

t5_6,Thermodynamicist,1309888218,"I'd say it's more of a drivable aeroplane than a flying car.  Personally, I'm not especially convinced by some of the decisions taken. In particular:  &gt; The NHTSA agreed with the position‚Äîemphasized by AOPA in its comments on the exemption request‚Äîthat the Transition could enhance aviation safety by giving VFR-only pilots who are confronted with deteriorating weather the option to divert to the nearest airport and continue their travel by road. Public interest would be served by reducing VFR-into-IMC accidents, it said.  People don't rationally decide to continue VFR into IMC. They either:  * don't realise that they've crossed the invisible line from VMC into IMC until it's too late. * make a totally irrational decision to press on into IMC because they're more worried that they might be late than that they might be *the late*, because they are worried about getting into trouble for getting caught out by the weather, or because they think that they're so good that the rules don't apply to them anymore.  Neither of these constituencies will be materially affected by the slight reduction in incremental cost and inconvenience which a roadable aeroplane offers them should they make the rational decision to land and continue by road.  Furthermore, people whose go/no-go decision is impacted by this sort of thing really shouldn't hold flying licenses in the first place.  I'm afraid that, much as I'd love to live in the future and all, I don't think that this sort of machine is a good idea, especially as a LSA. Folding wings add a decidedly non-trivial element of complexity to the design, and chucking 20 hour pilots into the mix seems like asking for trouble to me.  People will rapidly start treating it like a car, neglecting pre-flight checks of airframe (in particular the flying surfaces, which are at risk of road-rash as well as hangar/garage rash), engine &amp; prop, weather &amp; NOTAMs, flying outside the weight &amp; balance limits etc., and after the Darwin awards are handed out, the only beneficiaries will be the lawyers.  The other thing which slightly worries me is that it will almost certainly have very considerable aerodynamic directional stablility on the ground, so driving it in a cross-wind might be *extremely interesting*. The lack of electronic stability control on the road is therefore a bit alarming.  Also, the submission seems to be in violation of basic mathematics:  &gt; Terrafugia stated that the Transition¬Æ will cruise in the air at approximately 105 miles per hour and maintain highway speeds on the ground, while attaining between 25 and 40 miles per gallon in flight and on the road.  Yet the brochure says it'll burn 5 gph at 93 knots, i.e. 18.6 ampg.  It's all very well to suggest that using Mogas might be better for the environment than 100LL, but what will happen when somebody accidentally puts 100LL in the tanks?  I'd also be rather interested to learn how they plan to overcome the differences in standard control for cars and aeroplanes (so that e.g. people don't apply a boot full of right rudder instead of opening the throttle). Given that Harrier pilots periodically crash due to grabbing the wrong lever, it seems inevitable that 20 hour pilots will not be immune, especially given that their driving and flying environments will be identical with the exception of these control strategy differences...  **TL;DR** I'm not sure that this is such a great idea...  I also appear to have turned into a sceptical old man. I wonder when that happened...",¬Æ

You say that cigarettes are inherently bad, by that same logic movies and videogames are inherently bad.  Both are psychologically addictive and only serve to entertain, that entertainment can be found in other activities that lack negatives of the same magnitude.  Yes cigarettes can be chemically addictive, but the psychological addiction is much worse.  &gt; fun can be good as long as they do not cause harm, and for most video game players this is true.  Most smokers don't get lung cancer ([source](http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/content/164/12/1233.full)), while all video game player are wasting time.  I'm a gamer, but I don't lie to myself about the fact that it is a huge time suck.  It could even be measured as lost time, lost economic opportunity - a drain on society.  Think, I'm being absurd?  Maybe you're starting to get the point.  &gt; you can easily have a capitalistic system whilst taking care of the sick and infirm  You're confusing governance with economics.  Capitalism is dependent on the principal of self interest, the line only begins to blur when you start getting into *socialism*.  Thats right, Wolverines!  &gt; The most powerful cause of the financial crisis was greed and exploitation by companies seeking to maximise profits throught the explotation of sub prime mortages.  Again, self interest.  Those companies have to report earnings to shareholders, what are they to do when the government mandates that they loan money to people who can't possibly pay them back?  Pass the cost onto somebody else of course, by packaging the near worthless loans into a tradable commodity.  The poor people aren't to blame of course, the pandering politicians are.  &gt; So you have some anecdotal evidence and you're going to base your opinions of all poor people on that?  No not entirely, common sense plays a role.  As well as statistics.  [Poor people spend 9% of yearly income on lottery tickets](http://scienceblogs.com/cortex/2010/05/lotteries_2.php)  &gt; Yeah sure they can, and that has worked so well for all the people in America today who lack health care.  Yeah, we know it doesn't work for them because the streets are littered with dead homeless who only needed tonsillectomies.  Yeah, sarcasm is working really well though.  &gt; Except for the part where they operate completely independent from government  That is a huge plus.  &gt; People buying those things regularly aren't poor.  Eh, chalk it up to anecdotal evidence.  &gt; have never had any contact with the police  They would say they provide deterrence to a degree, most would agree.  So justified tax.  &gt; my military has not done anything for me ever  Again, deterrence.  Didn't you guys almost get steamrolled because of a lack of effective deterrence in WWII?  &gt; Why should I have to pay for the fire department to save the house of someone who chose not to buy fire insurance?  To keep the fire from spreading to your house.  &gt; Why should I have to pay for roads I never use?  You eat don't you?  You benefit from public roads.  &gt; Since the 80s the average income for those classed as lower class has gone up 0.01,% (adjusted for inflation) while the income for the wealthiest 5% has doubled.  LOL, wow - you better provide a source on that.  That isn't even a meaningful statistic.  If 10% of folks classified as low income got a raise and doubled their income then they wouldn't be classified as low income any longer now would they?  So the average income for those classed as low income would essentially remain the same as people increase wealth and prosperity (The American Dream‚Ñ¢) . ",‚Ñ¢

The only output of the clinical trial they mention on the website appears to be a Master's thesis (PM me if you want the PDF) which shows that it did nothing quantitative although some of the participants felt better. The abstract reads: &gt;This study compared the effects of electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) to volitional exercise on the tone of the buttocks muscles, hip circumference, and perceived satisfaction with the buttocks region. Seventy-two females, ages 20 and 60 years, were randomly placed into one of three groups: control, exercise, or stimulation. The exercise group performed 3 sets of 10 quadruped hip extensions with each leg, 5 days per week, for 6 weeks. The stimulation group underwent stimulation for 30 minutes, 5 days per week, for 6 weeks using the Slendertone¬Æ Bottom Toner. Subjects were tested at baseline, 4 weeks, and 6 weeks. Muscle tone of the buttocks was measured using a Myotonometer¬Æ. Hip girth was measured using a spring-loaded tape measure and body satisfaction was determined using a series of questionnaires. Results were compared to a control group. **There were no improvements in hip circumference or muscular tone. The exercise and stimulation group had significant improvements in score on both the Shape Evaluation and Body Satisfaction Questionnaires.** When Overall Results questionnaires were summarized, 92% of subjects in the exercise group and 88% of subjects in the stimulation group felt that they had positive results following the 6-week study.   Similar techniques have been used in medical studies to improve patient recovery [1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20592480),[2](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20091621) but appear not to be entirely efficacious. There is also [this](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1724878/pdf/v038p00505.pdf) report in which someone appears to have overused a similar device and caused [rhabdomyolysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhabdomyolysis) (muscle breakdown). So I would be **very** careful using it.  Additionally, if you are obese apparently they have to [up the current density or electrode size](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=electronic%20muscle%20stimulation%20obesity) to get through thick fat layers, likely making it more uncomfortable (as fat is a great insulator). I've done muscle conduction studies (similar technique) on myself at one point and I can tell you it's really not comfortable at all either.  Edit: fixed link.",¬Æ

I mean don't get me wrong, I guess Beeks have a small amount of guilt in the misunderstanding, true, but idk about you guys but the way I see it is that he was just hanging in the chat channel and someone said that no one wanted to play this master guy for group 2, Beeks read that and said ""Ok why not I'll give it a try"".  The way I see it he was just trying to help the clan actually and things when out of control when A LOT of people started saying that this whole thing was his fault, of course, he read that and snapped, specially after trying to help karma, he already said hes sorry and yes I saw his broadcasts and tried to talk to him to calm him down and show that everything was actually ok, no reason to be upset.  Idk about you guys but I see it like we faced a clan that had no organization at all, started to gather members the day of the CW and we had our groups with different skill levels and all, and they had just a bunch of players.  May I remind you that KarmaPolice was 4-0 in group 2? he was going to all kill, he was going to defeat every single korean in our group. But looks like that was too much for Han to handle, so they sent a master player to play diamonds. That was really even, BIG PROPS TO KPO FOR WHAT HE DID AND HOW HE DID IT!  After the game against beeks I tried to ask the guys to dont count that game because he was platinum and wasnt in our group and was a missunderstanding, of course, they said no, I guess they really wanted that win huh? so much to throw a master to play because ""they didn't had no more diamonds"", too bad i started checking profiles and found 2 that havent played in group 2.  Ok I guess that win meant too much for them, the one last thing that was kinda dissapointing for me, is that i had to wait for 3 and half hours, first just watching Kpo destroying and then they playing with a master and i didnt even got the chance to play, and again, I dont feel like that was Beeks fault cause he took my place, I appreciate what you did bro and glad you were fighting for Karma, but again, I know I'm not much but I wanted to try my best against this guy.

It's a 100% rye (one of the last in Canada) and the 25yo expression years ago disappeared from shelves within hours.  Alberta Distillers are a bit of a legend here since they make the last 2 100% rye whiskies in Canada and have always packaged them in the cheesy 70s decanter-like bottle you see above. They are also quite notable among Canadian whisky snobs for their remarkable prices. The typical 6yo AND 10yo bottles sell for $24, while the 25yo went for 30$ and this 30yo bottle went for the ridiculous price of $50.  This is my first whisky that is older than myself, and based on the incredibly long finish (on a rye, no less!) I can see why people scour the globe for old whiskies.  I'll avoid spamming r/scotch with non-scotch whisky stuff in the future, but I couldn't help myself after trying this bottle.

t5_2qh4r,necromanser,1310038644,"**THE HERTZIAN CONSPIRACY**  ""In late 1864, James Clerk Maxwell published his epic material on electromagnetic waves. His material dealt not only with electrical and magnetic waves, but also the relativistic/ethereal psychoactive component of these waves (representing electromagnetics of the second order and above). The equations also included transformations that enabled the change from inertial frames of reference to non-inertial frames of reference. Maxwell's original equations were written in Quaternion notation, a complex mathematical system available at that time before Vector Analysis was introduced by Oliver Heaviside. Today's generalized equivalent of Quaternions is Tensors.  ""In short, Maxwell's original work gave the necessary information for gravitational propulsion and psychoactive devices. Someone somewhere recognized this, for shortly after his death, the mathematician Oliver Heaviside, the chemist Willard Gibbs, and physicist Heinrich Hertz decided to ""edit"" or ""interpret"" Maxwell's famous equations which were, in the original form, the foundations of electromagnetics and Unified Field Theory (UFT). This ""unholy trio"", especially Heaviside, disregarded the Quaternions or Scalar components of Maxwell's original equations, because they represented potentials and not fields. He thought potentials were akin to ""mysticism"", because ""everybody knows"" that fields contain mass, and mass cannot be created from apparently nothing, which is what potentials are, both literally and mathematically; they are an accumulation or reservoir of energy. Furthermore, not only did they throw away the gravitational component with the Quaternion/Scalar, but also postulated that gravitation and electromagnetism were mutually exclusive, not interdependent. That was the death blow to subsequent efforts by scientists to realize a functioning unified field theory. Because of this one act, electromagnetism was reduced from its original five dimensions to only four: X, Y, Z, and time. The element of G was removed.  ""Because of this deliberate act, twenty-two other errors exist today in electromagnetic theory. The very concepts of force, mass and charge are ill-defined, and the so-called ""static"" electrical charge has been discovered by Quantum mechanics not to be static at all, but to move rotationally by virtue of the quantum mechanical spin. Finally, adding insult to injury, the so-called ""imaginary components"" of Maxwell's original equations as well as the mutilated version of the equations have also been discarded or ignored. With this last error, the door to hyper-spacial domains was forever closed, for the present mathematics and physics of electromagnetic theory do not allow for hyper-spacial domains (domains outside of three dimensions), superluminal signals (signals that exceed the speed of light or are infinite in speed), and a unified field theory.  ""The edited version of Maxwell's work, which every physicist and engineer has had to contend with, discards electrogravitation, and avoids the unification of gravitation and electromagnetics. It also prevents the direct engineering of gravitation, space-time, time flow rates, free energy devices, and quantum changes, which is viewed by the altered equations that are vector-based as only a statistical change. The quaternion approach captures the ability to utilize electromagnetics and produce local curvature of space-time. Heaviside wrote a subset of Maxwell's equations where this capability is excluded.  ""Dr. Henry Monteith has independently discovered that Maxwell's original quaternion theory was a unified field theory. Einstein assumed, because he only had access to the altered equations, that curving space-time could only be achieved by the weak gravitational force due to mass, that the local frame would always be a Lorentz frame, which would mean that all operations would be constrained to ""conservation laws of physics"".  ""In the 1960's the Hertz (Hz) replaced Cycles Per Second. Since, then everyone thinks that all electromagnetic waves are hertzian. Only the upper portion of the spectrum before Infrared contains Hertzian waves. ELF and ULF are not; waves in biosystems and natural phenomena are not Hertzian in nature."" ¬© Valdemar Valerian.

t5_2qpp6,NeoDestiny,1310087268,"Speed's incredibly frustrating to listen to because he's very similar to Idra in the way that he delivers his message - usually wrapped up in some incredibly narcissistic package, following a really bad loss.  Anyway, here's a response, since the e-mail got made public.  -  &gt;So after watching your game earlier with a Terran that clearly knew what he was doing, dropping everywhere, making ghosts, using snipe, getting bases and stuff; I've come to the conclusion that you are just really bad. You really should take that replay and analyze it a bit because there was so much you could've done better.  Believe it or not, I understand a lot of my problems going from game to game.  I don't have to sit and analyze a replay to understand that my third being late is the reason why I'm floating 1k minerals, or that floating 1k/1k at 12 mins into the game and then losing to a push is bad.  My problems in the games Speed are referring to, however, all involve me getting put behind by some form of early harass.  I understand my problems and try to fix them from game to game.  That being said, it's impossible to completely fix a problem in between 1 game.  I really, really enjoy being able to play against someone who beats me 6 games in a row because it gives me a lot to work on and think about.  The person who 6-0ed me yesterday is going to become a new training partner, until I can do the same to her.  &gt;The first time you lost your 3rd I actually predicted in chat ""Hey watch him make infestors 20 seconds late and die to a push because he doesn't have infestors in time"", and guess what happened... Everything you did seemed (and I assume was) ""by feel"" and not by any precise timing, as such, your upgrades were later than should be, your infestors were later than should be, your expansions were later than should be.   It's important not to analyze a replay incorrectly, and to be mindful of your mistakes, but it's even more important to understand how to analyze the mistakes you're making.  If you play a game and lose after making a critical error like losing your third base, you don't even need to watch the rest of the replay.  You need to FIX LOSING YOUR THIRD.  Anything that happens after that is irrelevant.  Obviously timings/upgrades are going to be off after something game-shattering like that occurs.  &gt;Another thing that really annoys me is that you keep floating thousands upon thousands of minerals, yet you are reluctant to get extractors on your bases immediately or even try what I suggested: bases solely for gas until having base mined out. I'm sure you want to, but you either hesitate to do it, or you are not good enough to remember to, I seriously hope the former.  I've actually improved on the floating thing quite a bit recently, especially in ZvP and ZvZ.  My ZvT is still a little shaky at points because I'm jut not sure what units to make, but I still don't think I'm floating TONS of resources at all points in the game, except for when I'm in awkward situations.  &gt;I don't even try to go into other, more subtle points like gas timings, getting overlord before drone or drone before overlord, because I know you will never consider such fine things since you're all about that core play... which is why you are very INCONSISTENT.  The reason I'm inconsistent is because I don't play enough good games against good players.  I also make poor strategical decisions at certain points in games.  My mechanics are actually one of the strongest aspects of my play, so it's pretty annoying when people say ""oh, he has bad macro"" just because my third/fourth timings are so much different than other people's.  People also say things like ""Idra has sick macro!"" when in reality, he just takes thirds and drones them incredibly quickly, sometimes at a detriment to himself when it comes to surviving certain early pressure.  &gt;You keep trying to make the perfect build that works against everything and keep adding stuff making it more and more loose, and I guess that's ok, but on the other hand you do stupid shit like keeping 10 infestors under the terran army for 15 seconds and then when he scans TO CLEAR CREEP you rage at how lucky his scan was, even though it was 100% predictable, as I predicted in chat (like the priorly-mentioned late infestors). Do you want to know why it's predictable? Because you do it all the time and it is entirely avoidable. Catz has told you multiple times to not do that... but I guess I shouldn't bring Catz in the discussion since his play is sloppy as hell too. And then people whine that Zerg is underpowered and weak and shit.. pfft.  I think my infestor play is pretty sloppy sometimes.  Sometimes my micro/control are incredibly good, other times I just make poor decisions.  Sending all infestors to certain spots is necesary sometimes.  The game Speed is referencing, however, was not to clear creep, it was just an incredibly lucky scan.  The Terran even admitted it at the end of the game, he was just scanning ahead of his army before a push and caught the tail-end of 1 infestor, then a second scan revealed all 10.  I think it's reasonable to be able to expect to burrow and sneak infestors by an army with no ravens, as Terrans can't perpetually scan the ground around their army.  &gt;I am seriously not going to fucking take example from any more ""high level"" zergs since I've come to the conclusion that they all suck dick at the game, with a few exceptions. Fuck this game, fuck this meta-game, fuck all the whining and crying and raging over stupid shit when obviously the problem is with the players, not the game. I can't wait for Day9 to actually get good at the game and show people how to tighten their shit up.  Agreed, for the most part.  &gt;Right now, it's really fucking sad... remember when we used to make fun of people like Acergame and how they still won even though they were horrible, just because they were Terran? Well right now I feel like you are winning just because of infestors and it makes me emotionally confused.  I think some T's don't respond to it well, but it's also fairly difficult to respond to correctly.  I don't feel like my play is gimmicky, but I do feel that some people respond incredibly poorly to it.  &gt;You know how I always bash on Morrow how he is a stupid player and always does stupid shit and that I hate him and what not, that is totally true, but his shit is fucking tight as fuck, his macro is amazing and he wins even when he fucks up hardcore just because his fundamentals are top notch from his Terran play and shitton of practicing BUILDS and TIMINGS instead of general play. You, however, I regard as a smart player, that wins games by out-witting your opponents and doing fancy shit, but you execute everything VERY POORLY, which is why you lose against people like Pride, Fuzer and who else, because they have a one-dimensional play. You cannot outwit them, there's no way you can do that since they do the same thing regardless and they are in their little turtle shell until the end of the game. The only way to beat them is by just having perfect fundamentals up until mid-game.   I disagree with this.  I think ""average"" spectators are really quick to look at a Z who very quickly takes 3-4 bases and say ""WOW, HIS MACRO IS GOOD!""  Good macro =/= taking lots of bases and droning quickly.  My execution is very good, the only thing off in my play atm is just some strategic decisions I make, and responding to early pressures in different ways.  I don't lose to players like Pride/Fuzer because my execution is bad, I just lose to coin flip builds.  My execution vs those players is generally close to perfect because it's still in the early game and managing 2 bases perfectly isn't very difficult.  To say that ""fundamentals"" determine your ability to beat a high-risk, coin-flip build is a bit misleading, I would say.   &gt;Just imagine for a minute how glorious it would be if you used your builds, your tactics, your awesomeness at the level of precision that some other players do. You would be twice the player you are now.  My precision isn't the problem, though, it's some strategic decisions I make in the mid-game.  &gt;With a huge ""Fuck you and get better!"", &gt;Speed &gt;/rant  I love you, Speed.  ‚ô•",‚ô•

People like to drink a lot of beer during games (probably to much) and then there's the excitement to catch a ball, both might impair their ability to judge the risk and the ballpark owners _know_ this.  It's a fun sport that should be _fun_, yet many accidents happen every year, some even deadly like this one..completely unacceptable that spectators can get harmed like that.  The AFL is very similiar (in that probably everyone wants to catch a football), but they have proper netting near the endzones, and still the stands behind them are filled like any other place.  I don't get why baseball tradition overrides safety. One of the ballparks has a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• flagpole in centerfield. So safety nets around the outfield (in case someone drops) should be fine, even if it interferes with some plays either that or fences above the railing, same with nets that protect from line drives, can't tell that the reduced 'experience' is worth more than the life or sight of a spectator, that only wants to have a fun day, especially since most people won't even be able to react to a really fast ball. Most players on the field don't even use the coach boxes or on deck circles, because they know they're way to close to the zone that sees ridiculous line drives frequently, which brings me to the dugouts, there is no excuse why they don't have a proper netting that prevents a ball from entering them or even more actually allows someone to get killed inside them..  No, there is nothing funny about the stubborness inside baseball when it comes to safety. I wish that someone finally stands up and sues the shit out of the owners, to finally get a league wide move that improves safety to a point, where you don't risk losing your life as a guest of the ballpark.

If it's forbidden, it's forbidden, regardless of where , when or how you decide to wear it.   ------------------------------------------------------------- &gt;Exposure.  Even if they get exposed to more situations, the other factors described in relations to the physical nature of a female is still present.  -------------------------------------------------------------- &gt;Middle aged men have a 40% depression rate while women have a 25% rate. http://www.upliftprogram.com/facts_depression_men.html  That's middle aged men only compared to middle aged women, but what about the rest of the age demographic? You can't discount physical hormonal issues in females either.  ---------------------------------------------------------------- &gt;So, we live in a country that goes off of scientific fact. If a woman's natural cycle damages a woman's judgement that badly, why would we do it? Also, you failed to answer how emotions causes a woman to say yes or no to a factual question, ""Did you witness the signing of this contract?"" If you say she'll say answer out of emotions then you say that women on their periods are liars, because factual yes/no questions can't be interpreted.  It's this very scientific fact that has shown the different stresses women are experiencing due to hormonal and physical changes. But due to things such as gender equality, which has taken a forefront and in reality, has been moved away from equal rights for women, to how much of a man can we make a woman.   I didn't say woman are liars, but I did say that certain hormonal and physical attributes may cause a woman not to have paid sufficient attention to the details required to be a witness, in a broad sense.   --------------------------------------------------------------- &gt;You missed my point. My question was that: if we are giving women half the power in court because of their emotions, should we lessen the power of the other emotionally impaired people? I say no naturally.  The other emotionally impaired people will be judged based on their situation. If these emotions are deemed to be a hurdle to getting an accurate and reliable testimony, then that individual will not be used as a witness.  -------------------------------------------------------------- &gt;It's been known for centuries that Matthew wasn't written by the actual apostle. Also, the Bible hasn't changed, just the exact wording. Lastly, Christian beliefs haven't changed. The churches founded by the Apostles (The Catholic Church and the Orthodox Church) have remained true to their teachings through the centuries. Joe the Preacher and his Church is not an example to be used. It's like blaming a Sunni for doctrinal actions of a Shia.  So if Mathew wasn't written by an actual apostle, and no one knows how wrote Mathew, how does anyone accept it?   *""Also, the Bible hasn't changed, just the exact wording""* , this statement is incorrect and you know it. There are portions of the bible that have been removed, and wording has been changed in numerous places. Not only that, no one knows the correct bible because the original text is no longer there. It's also interesting that a supposed Muslim, that you claim to be, is defending the Bible not having been changed?  Look at [Mathew 18:11](http://bible.cc/matthew/18-11.htm), why does this verse not appear in the following versions ?  New International Version (¬©1984)  New Living Translation (¬©2007)  English Standard Version (¬©2001)   It is because they say it is an interpolation.  ------------------------------------------------------------ &gt;"" Those who follow the Messenger (Mohammed), the Prophet who can neither read nor write, whom they will find described in the Torah and the Gospel (which are) with them (7:157 MP). And when there cometh unto them (Jews) a Scripture (the Qur'an) from Allah, confirming that in their possession (2:89 MP)"" This is a false statement, and if God is wrong once, that means it can't be God. Also, much of the information in that book was known by the Greeks. For example, the fact that iron came from the sky.  Again, you need to know the bible in order to know the truth. [Here are the portions of the Bible that mention the Prophet Mohammed (saw).](http://www.islam101.com/religions/christianity/mBible.htm)  Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) is mentioned by name in the [Song of Solomon chapter 5 verse 16](http://hebrewoldtestament.com/B22C005.htm). The original Hebrew text is provided as well as the transliteration and if you look at this word ""MChMDYM"". This word doesn't even exist in the Hebrew language, so they not knowing that it's a name, translated it incorrectly.  ------------------------------------------------------------ &gt;How do you know it's Jesus talking about God? Jesus was saying that even before Abraham was, he existed. How do I know this? Because in the next verse the Jews were picking up rocks to stone him with.  Look at the verses I gave from Exodus.  [3:13] And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What is his name? what shall I say unto them? [3:14] And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you.  Why didn't the Isrealites ever accuse Moses of blasphemy when he gave the very same ""I AM"" to them? It's because they knew what questions they had, and it was an answer. They had asked for a name, and Moses provided it. But the translators, didn't understand this, so they translated it as ""I AM"". Look at what God tells Moses to tell the Isrealites who sent him *"" I AM hath sent me unto you""*. Think about it, they ask for a name, and God says ""I AM"", does that make sense? Did they ask what God was? NO, they asked for a name.  When Jesus gave them the very same name, the Jews didn't understand it, so they said he blasphemed, not understanding that Jesus was saying.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------- &gt;Matthew 27:46 is a reference to Psalm 22:1. You can read more here: http://bible.cc/matthew/27-46.htm  So? How does it make sense, that you claim Jesus is the ""Word"", which God says in John 1:1, *""and the Word was God""*, so who was Jesus crying out to and if Jesus was being killed, was God being killed, and who was looking after the Heavens when God wasn't there? Also, are you claiming that God committed suicide?  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- &gt;Himself. He was talking to himself basically. It's complicated. The incarnation was speaking to home base. Or, for example with the Our Father, it was an example for us.  What? seriously? Jesus was talking to himself? So supposedly, Jesus came to die on the cross for everyone's sins, sounds like suicide because according to Christians, Jesus chose to do this, but then he goes and says *"" ""Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?""--which means, ""My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?""""*.   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- &gt;This son of God is very special in the sense that this guy can forgive sins. How do you answer that? The Jews respond to him that only God can forgive sins after He just forgave sins.  Where does it say that the son of God in reference to Adam, is different to the son of God reference to Jesus? Provide proof of your claims.   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- &gt;Which is why the Greek in this case is very special. It means unique and not created. When you generate by procreation that is being created. Your whole argument is English based, reread the Greek definition.  Why don't you provide the original text in Hebrew to very that the Greek translation is correct? can't do that can you? So you're at the mercy of who every translated it with what every mistakes they made. The uniqueness is already stated by the word ""only"", and begotten is already known to be an physical animal act of the lower organs, so are you saying that Jesus is the only one God had to procreate to create? He couldn't do what he did with Adam, he needed a woman for Jesus? Seriously?  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- &gt;You still need to answer Matt. 12:8; Mark 2:28; Luke 6:5 - Jesus says that He is ""Lord of the Sabbath."" He is the Lord of God's law which means He is God. Matt. 18:20 - Jesus says where two or three are gathered in His name, there He is in the midst of them. Matt. 7:21-22; Luke 6:46 - not everyone who says to Jesus, ""Lord, Lord."" Jesus calls Himself Lord, which is God.  As for these, I will provide the responses shortly, because time didn't permit, but I will try and respond shortly.          ",¬©

t5_2qi79,strolls,1310153126,"I'm new to guitar, but I bought a modelling amp to learn with, and because I'm a bit of a geek I spent a little time contemplating the technology.  I think there's a lot of potential in modelling amps - even if they don't sound *exactly* the same as a 1963 Fender Blues Buddy‚Ñ¢, I can't see why it shouldn't be possible to get tone out of a modelling amp that's just as good as any valve amp.  Considering the price of DSP chips (I would guess 50¬¢ or $1 each) compared to the price of valves, it did occur to me it might be possible to get in at the beginning of the wave of ""boutique"" modelling amps, but I was struck by exactly the problem these guys claim to be solving - how to *literally copy* the performance of a valve under various conditions.  The whole point of valves is that they're analogue and that they behave somewhat ""idiosyncratically"". Just because you can model what happens when you increase the volume going through the valve at one frequency (note), doesn't mean it'll behave exactly the same at some other frequency. ISTM like there are a lot of different factors (gain; what about effects?) that can influence the way a valve behaves, and I'm somewhat sceptical that they can capture that merely by mic'ing up a tube amp. On the other hand, [they *do* seem to be honest about that limitation in their FAQ](http://kemper-amps.com/page/render/lang/en/p/163/do/Kemper_Profiling_Amplifier___FAQ.html) (see the ""Does the profile contain all possible gain and tone control settings of the original amp?"" section).  The Kemper isn't released yet, so the price will be an important factor (but it does look expensive) and the proof will be in hearing it.  ISTM, however, that one thing you're paying for when you buy a modelling amp from the big boys (Fender, Line 6, &amp;c) is that they have teams of really skilled geeks who spend their whole time trying to achieve accurate modelling, and copying specific models of classic amps. People write post-grad dissertations on valve behaviour, and no single paper alone is enough that you can just copy an algorithm into C programming code and have a working model - such a paper will only look at one aspect of what one particular valve is doing when you do one particular thing to it. With such big companies as Fender and Line 6 the guys who are doing the modelling - that is *all* they do, they don't really have to worry about product development, manufacturer or marketing, that gets handed off to someone else. So they should be pretty good at it.  I doubt if those (Fender, Line 6, &amp;c) teams will be doing ""literal copying"" of amps, using electrical or audio techniques to *capture* the sound the way Kemper proposes - I would guess that they will do a lot of analysis using graphs and computer screens, and they will spend many hours adjusting and tweaking the model by hand and by ear, until it does actually *sound right to them* over the whole of the range. They plug in different guitars to the original amp and try it alongside their computer model, to compare them with each other, using (for instance) humbucklers and single-coils. I think that attempting ""literal capture"" will show its limitations, when set alongside dedicated ""crafting"" of the modelled tone.   Whereas pretty much anyone with a soldering iron can build a valve amp, tweak it a bunch of different ways until they stumble on the ""perfect tone"", DSP modelling is not so accessible. Valve amplification circuits are well-understood and -documented, they're pretty simple, really, whereas besides all the complexities of trying to copy valve behaviour, DSP modelling also requires that a very good computer programmer. I concluded there are probably relatively few opportunities to manufacture ""boutique"" modelling amps.  Kemper seems to have solid background in the music industry, and a reputation of making good synths, but I'll wait and see if it sounds better than the competition.",‚Ñ¢

This is interesting to cities, counties, and major air carriers who have to operate the airports themselves.  I assure you it is not at all interesting to private pilots!  We care about airspace.  There's [international airspace classifications](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airspace_class) that the US *mostly* adheres to, but all that'd matter to you as a private pilot is class B-E and class G, as described [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airspace_class_(United_States)).  The three types of towered airports - Bravo, Charlie, and Delta - all have their own airspace and requirements to operate in that airspace.  Deltas have the smallest, slowest planes.  Even though many Delta's are *busier* in number of aircraft than the Charlies around them, they airspace is smaller and simpler because slow and light planes don't need as much space to safely operate in.  Bravos tend to have nonstop arrivals and departures of heavy jets that have to keep up speed and emit wake turbulance all around, so they need a lot of controlled airspace to work with.

t5_2qh0u,GerkSprongle2,1310178394,"As is usual in this thing some brief scrutinisation of the book reveals it to be a lie like all the other holocaust claims. ""Why did the Germans put Wiesel in the hospital, operate on him, and nurse him back to health, if their purpose was to kill all the Jews in Europe?    Why, for the same reason, did the Germans put Elie‚Äôs father in the hospital when he got sick?   How did the undersized 15 year old Wiesel fool the Germans into thinking he was 18?   Why did they put him in the children‚Äôs barracks in 1945, when his official age would have been 19 at the time.   Given the choice of going to Germany with their German captors, or remaining at Auschwitz to be liberated by the Soviets, why did the Wiesels choose to go with the murderers of so many of their people?   Those are just a few of the scores of questionable claims made by Wiesel in ‚ÄúNight.‚Äù   It is hard for me to choose the most ludicrous of his claims, but the one where he claimed that blood spurted out of the ground like geysers, months after a mass burial of jews, and his story of the burning pits are at the top of any list. Wiesel wrote: ‚Äù Later, I learn from a witness that, for month after month, the ground never stopped trembling; and that, from time to time, geysers of blood spurted from it.‚Äù  As ludicrous as are the blood geysers, if forced to choose, I will name the tale of the burning pits the champion of them all.   At the time Wiesel wrote his book, there were several different methods of genocide ascribed to the Germans. All of them, BTW, were entered into evidence at Nuremberg, and the court ‚ÄúTook judicial notice‚Äù of them all.   In Germany today it is criminal offense to deny anything that the Nuremberg Tribunal ‚ÄúJudicially noted.‚Äù Ergo, if you deny that the Germans killed the Jews by electrocuting them on a metal floor which was submerged in water and then electrified, you are a criminal. If you deny that the Jews were killed by introducing steam into closed rooms full of Jews, you are a criminal. If you deny that the Jews were killed by gassing, you are a criminal. If you deny that the Jews were killed by tossing them into flaming pits, you are a criminal.   Having no idea which of the versions would be finally settled upon as the ‚ÄúOfficial Holocaust‚Ñ¢ Story,‚Äù Wiesel unfortunately made the wrong choice and went with the burning pit version. Not once in his detailed recapitulation of his stay in Auschwitz did he even mention the Gas Chambers!  Thus we see him saying: ‚ÄúNot far from us, flames were leaping from a ditch, gigantic flames. They were burning something. A lorry drew up at the pit and delivered its load -- little children. Babies! Yes, I saw it -- saw it with my own eyes ... Those children in the flames. (Is it surprising that I could not sleep after that? Sleep has fled from my eyes.)‚Äù   At a place where the water table is less than a yard below the surface, Wiesel has the Germans digging pits in which corpses are burned. In a pit, where bodies are stacked upon each other below ground level, science tells that any effort to burn them will affect only the top couple of layers. No matter how much accelerant is poured in on the top layer, bodies 5 or 6 layers deep would not even get warm! Not even in a place where the bottom layers would not be submerged in water, as they would have been at Auschwitz.   Wiesel says he and his father were marched toward the pit, and he was sure he was going to die. Then he says: ‚ÄúTwo steps from the pit we were ordered to turn to the left and made to go into a barracks.""   The scientific impossibility of the method Wiesel describes for burning the bodies is not what really draws me to the burning pit as my favorite Wiesel tale; it is something from my own youth‚Äîsomething which made me know for a moral certainty that Wiesel was lying about his own experience with the burning pit.  When I was about 12 or 13, I was staying with my grandfather, who raise prize mules, which were sought after by folks from 3 states. During my stay, his venerable ‚ÄúTop mule,‚Äù Old Bob died, and Grandpa cremated the remains.    The pyre had to be built according to specific requirements, in order to accomplish the desired result. There was a pit about 2 feet deep dug, with a trence around the perimeter and railroad ties criss-crossed in the pit, so that air could reach the bottom of the fuel. Then a huge pile of wood was laid on top of the ties, and the corpse of the mule hoisted to the top with a winch. When the fire got a good start, Grandpa pulled me about 20 feet from the pit. When it reached its most intense levels, we moved even further back, and we still had to turn our faces away from the fire, because of the heat.   Anyone approaching within a few feet of that fire would not have lived to tell the tale.""",‚Ñ¢

EDIT: In case I didn't communicate my point clearly the first time, I'm making a pedagogical suggestion, for if you understand what kind of solutions they'll figure out. If you want to drive home a certain point, such as patience (or a specific maze-solving algorithm ‚úù), then you should create an exercise that specifically illustrates that point: the prize should be *inside* the constraints of the border.  ‚úù‚úù  However, it's damned hard to get those kids to respect those constraints, because it's inevitable that they'll imagine up some pass-through rule like ""oh, I can tunnel through these walls!""  ‚úù Incidentally, maze-solving algorithms are actually useful in real life -- I lost my car in a parking garage last year and I realized that I could use the ""always turn right"" pattern to guarantee that I would sweep the whole garage for my car.

It is a very thorough, but not very efficient maze-solving process.  ‚úù‚úù The example is in centuries of literature illustrating both sides -- that, although through hard work comes success (I believe Confuscius was a big fan of this), cleverness is also a good trait (Roald Dahl's *The Incredible Mr. Fox* comes to mind) which leads to continual survival.  ... the more I read through things, the more I think I agree with funkstep's original point.

You've started out with a baseless accusation:  &gt;""Ps, You're kinda breaking the reddit rules by outing my personal information on here, last time I checked that was a foul.""  Incorrect, and please don't accuse me of breaking rules here, because we both know it's not true. If you post personal information *to Reddit* and someone else references *the words you wrote yourself*, they are not ""outing"" anything. You did that yourself. Surely you can see that. You're an intelligent person. You posted your age to a comment that was easily seen on the *first* page of your comment stream when viewed by anyone, whether they were logged in or not. I broke no rule. You posted personal information. In your comment to which I'm replying, you've posted more personal information. If I were to repost it in this comment, am I breaking the rules? Not at all, because you posted this personal information yourself. In fact, if I were to post your bio from the Versaries [About Us](http://www.versariesapp.com/about.html) page, that would be well within the rules, too, because *you* told us who you are and what company you work for and that company's Web site contains personal information. In other words, it's not *private* information. It's public. I believe that the rules do not allow the posting of someone's address or telephone number (or, at least, they should not allow this, even if it can be found elsewhere online, because it can lead to real-world harassment, and that's a very bad thing), and I would never post that type of information to Reddit, even if you listed it in another comment on Reddit. Your age was relevant. Your address and phone number, for example, are not.  If you want to talk about breaking rules, *spamming is not allowed*. You've posted about your app *three* times in as many weeks. Three times. The fact that you delete threads within a day after creating them because people post comments that you dislike does not make it less of a spam issue and it rightly draws the sort of criticism that I've posted today.  &gt;""The Privacy Policy is in the app under the heading 'Privacy Policy'. I didn't write it, and I'm not in charge of it.""  This is your thesis project, right? It seems like it's a company's project. If so, and if you have at least four people involved in your company, it's at least a little misleading to call it a thesis project, even if it *is* one. I understand why you did, though. It gets people to download the app because they think they are helping out a college student by testing and commenting on the app. It's a little misleading, though. You're just starting out in the world and this would normally be overlooked and written off to a lack of experience, but the fact that you delete threads and comments because they paint your application in a negative light (and, really, the comments weren't that bad in the first thread), only to re-post new threads a week later, causes everything to be called into question. Surely you can understand this. A misunderstanding is what you've called it. Fair enough, but it was brought about by your actions.  Also, if this is *your* thesis project, why are you not responsible for the privacy policy of the app itself? You seem to be washing your hands of the privacy policy. If it's your app. It's your policy. If it's *not* your app, be honest about that from the start. This is one more reason why I, and others in the past, have questioned you.  &gt;""One thread was deleted because we found a bug, another because I posted under the wrong screen name.""  Regarding the second thread that was deleted because you posted under the wrong screen name:  1. Why didn't you re-post it under the correct name when you realized that you made this mistake? Instead, you conversed with me, posting two comments in reply to mine. Maybe you realized that you posted it under the wrong account after your second comment in reply to me. Fair enough, but you never re-posted it under the correct name. What would you assume, if someone else did this? Probably that you didn't want to re-post it because I would see it and reply again with the same comments.  2. Why did you post two replies to me, then delete BOTH of them, then delete the thread itself? Why not simply leave it, especially if you weren't going to post it again under the right screen name? Surely you can see how this makes you, your app and your company look?  Regarding the first thread that was deleted because you found a bug:  1. Why does it matter that you found a bug? There were several comments that people took the time to post about your app. If you want to build trust with community members and not give them the impression that you are simply spamming them with ads, deleting posts with their comments, twice, is not the way to go. I'm sure that you can understand that deleting the thread because you found a bug in your app, after there was a lot of discussion about it, makes you look like you are trying to hide something (especially when most of the truly *negative* comments posted to that thread had to do with privacy issues -- people were rather understanding regarding the bug that didn't allow them to get past the initial screen).  2. Reddit is not your personal advertising space where you should be posting about your app and then deleting the posts later after a conversation has been started. If you want to advertise, spend $20 and buy an ad on Reddit rather than re-posting the same link to your app over and over.  &gt;""I can't answer every question about the privacy policy, because it's not my area.""  It's your app. Make it your area. When someone asks you a question, you should probably do your best to get the answer from the person who has it so that you can answer them in plain English. You tell everyone that you are a poor college student and talk about your app as a ""thesis"" project, but you apparently have someone dedicated, at your *company* (the bottom of your Web site says ""Copyright ¬© 2011 Versaries LLC""), to legal matters. ~~Is Versaries, LLC really a company registered in one of the 50 states?~~ &lt;-- Yes, registered in Ohio.  The problem is that you have behaved in a way that makes it *very* easy to suspect that you are not, as datagrim said above, on the up and up. You post an app that is clearly owned by a registered company (if the LLC is, in fact, registered somewhere), but you talk about it as if it's yours alone. Then, you delete posts when people ask questions about privacy, of all subjects (this was what *really* brought on all the criticism by me and others in the first thread you created, and everything else was secondary and only drew more suspicion). Please don't be surprised when someone calls you on it and asks for more information. As I said in my previous comment:  &gt;""When you first wrote about your app on Reddit, I thought people were being too hard on you (some of the comments had a rather nasty tone), but when I saw that you deleted the post and then re-posted it two weeks later, and then deleted it again when I asked, nicely, about your policy and what information was stored on your servers, I became suspicious...""  Anyway, this time, maybe you shouldn't delete this thread and, if you want to post about your app for a 4th time, perhaps you should buy an ad on Reddit. The cost is very low and very reasonable.  By the way, your app looks beautiful, but I've frankly been so turned off by your actions that I haven't even used it. That's why I asked about the privacy policy in my last comment to the second thread that you deleted. I wanted to know more. When you deleted the thread, I said, ""Well, I guess that settles it."" Was I wrong to feel that way? I don't think so.  ----  *Edit: Corrected a typo or three and edited the information struck out above.*",¬©

t5_2qk5q,Will_Power,1310274770,"&gt;Please provide substantial evidence that scientists agree humans had ""very little"" influence. You'll also need to quantify what ""very little"" means here, but from what I've read scientists agree humans had significant influence over the first part of the 20th century warming.  Then you haven't read AR4.  &gt;I'm sorry, but it is up to you to demonstrate that the total solar effect was higher than CO2, and you'll need to provide as much evidence as there is against that notion.  How do we test two forcings?  We wait for significant decline in one (happening) while the other increases, then look at what happens.  The last ten years have been very telling, but 10 years is not sufficient time to determine climate independent of noise, so we must wait a few more years.  If the next 4-9 years don't show a big increase in temperature, that will show that CO2 has been overestimated.  &gt;Actually, the paper makes it clear that sulfur compounds overshadow other natural variations such as solar activity and the PDO.   Funny, my reading of the papers suggests all three factors are considered and that there was no attribution of what percent each causes.  &gt;Despite all this, temperatures continued to increase.  No, actually, it hasn't.  &gt;I know this puts a dent in your pet theory, but sulfur compounds are a much better candidate to explain the slowdown in temperature increases than solar forcings.  Then you'll have no problem pointing me to a data set for these forcings.  I've been looking for one for a while.  The problem is that so many modelers chose just to fill in the value for aerosol forcing with whatever is needed to make the model fit the data, as I'm sure you've read recently.  &gt;You've never said otherwise that only CO2 forcings count? Wow.  What?  I've never said that CO2 *doesn't* count.  My position all along is that there are many factors.  I dispute that CO2 is the *primary* factor.  &gt;Again, without evidence. Meanwhile, I've provided a link to a solid article stating climate sensitivity is very probably at 3C.  And *again*, I have pointed you to the AR4 summary showing the results of *many* studies.  The mean of the distributions in that summary is 3¬∞C, as you suggest.  The mean of *the most likely values* from each study is closer to 2¬∞C.  &gt;Again, you miss the larger point. It is possible for transient phenonemon, such as lower solar activity and increased aerosols to lower temperatures for a limited time.  Yet none of the scenarios in AR4 include such a possibility.  You are trying to hedge, my friend.    &gt;This, however, does not change the basic issue that CO2 is increasing temperatures, and once those temporary negative forcings stop having an downward effect, the resulting increase will be dramatic.  You expect solar activity to return to the levels it experienced during the 20th century?  I suggest you look at various solar reconstructions.  Solar activity during that time was higher than any time in the last millennium.  &gt;As I have said again and again, you're smart enough to understand this, but your irrational desire to root for the underdog is tainting your thought process, which is why you end up being less critical of research that support your pre-existing opinion, even though the research is not yet mature (such as cloud seeding) while being overly skeptical of well-established science.  Thank you, I suppose, for the compliment.  You, too, are bright enough to recognize that our understanding of climate is incomplete.  With each percent of uncertainty comes the possibility of overconfidence in a single variable.  You continue to try to project political motives or a love for the underdog on me.  I've been looking at the issue for several years.  The problems with the so-called consensus position have not been answered to my satisfaction.  If they had been, I would gladly change my tune.  I've stated publicly that if warming returns over the next decade at a rate that matches the rate experienced from 1970-2000, that would demonstrate that I was wrong and I would gladly discard my skeptical position.  Can you draw a similar line in the sand?  It sounds very much like you are looking for reasons to remain a True Believer‚Ñ¢ even if projected warming does not occur.  Who, then, is the more honest of us in this debate?  &gt;Fortunately, public opinion and governments no longer share your dangerous wait-and-see approach, and steps to mitigate the threat posed by AGW are being taken.  Have you even followed public opinion?  Public opinion favoring AGW peaked in 2009.  I don't know what governments you are talking about, but it certainly isn't the governments of the two largest CO2 emitters.  &gt;I'm sorry, but as usual your bias is having the better of you.  Ditto.  &gt;As for the rest, we'll talk again in 10 years and see if your guess was as good as mine.   We will indeed.  I've already stated my prediction that we will see a cooling of 0.1¬∞C.

t5_2qk5q,archiesteel,1310276633,"&gt;Then you haven't read AR4.  That's not a response. Please indicate the section, page numbers, etc.  &gt;If the next 4-9 years don't show a big increase in temperature, that will show that CO2 has been overestimated.  Again, that depends on the presence of other forcings, such as aerosols. You are deliberately setting the bar too high in order to prop up your own pet theory.  Again, there is no serious evidence supporting the idea that a potential solar minimum will have an *overall* impact larger than 0.3C, and since this would be a temporary decrease, it would not solve the issues tied to the CO2 forcing.  You only argument is a red herring. Perhaps it's time to consider leaving science to the scientists...  &gt;Funny, my reading of the papers suggests all three factors are considered and that there was no attribution of what percent each causes.  Again, please provide quotes to support your allegations.  &gt;No, actually, it hasn't.  Yes, actually, they have. Temperatures have increased over the last period long enough to be statistically significant. You can continue to falsely claim they haven't, but that doesn't make it true - it's just more of your empty posturing.  &gt;What? I've never said that CO2 doesn't count.  That's not what I said. That's twice in a row you've misunderstood plain sentences - are you doing this on purpose to obfuscate a debate you know you are losing? Sure sounds like it.  &gt; I dispute that CO2 is the primary factor.  And yet you have failed to produce significant evidence to support your claim.  &gt;And again, I have pointed you to the AR4 summary showing the results of many studies. The mean of the distributions in that summary is 3¬∞C, as you suggest. The mean of the most likely values from each study is closer to 2¬∞C.  Please provide evidence supporting this claim. Thanks.  James Annan didn't simply do a ""mean of the distributions"", as you claim. You like to make claims, but not supporting them, it seems. I refer to you to the blogpost:  ""When we combined some of the most credible and solidly-grounded (in our opinion) estimates arising from different observational evidence, we found that the resulting posterior pdf was substantially narrower than any of the observationally-based estimates previously presented. It's inevitable that such a narrowing would occur, but we were surprised by how substantial the effect was and how robust it was to uncertainties in the individual constraints.""  Here is the actual paper, which you obviously haven't read for making such dismissive statements:  http://www.jamstec.go.jp/frcgc/research/d5/jdannan/GRL_sensitivity.pdf  &gt;Yet none of the scenarios in AR4 include such a possibility. You are trying to hedge, my friend.  Who cares? No, really, who the fuck cares? The sulfur aerosol issue is *current* research, and Annan has been vindicated in his argument against uniform priors. Why do you keep whining about AR4 all the time?  Until you come up with actual evidence supporting your assertions, the current science, *without* using uniform priors, is that climate sensitivity is at 3C, and that variations in the solar forcing have a very minor role to play (which makes sense, consider it's just a couple of w/m^2 of TSI, and no clear link with cosmic and UV rays has been established).  &gt;You expect solar activity to return to the levels it experienced during the 20th century? I suggest you look at various solar reconstructions. Solar activity during that time was higher than any time in the last millennium.  ...and yet, the variation was overall very small, and cannot account for the majority of the warming. Stop propping up that red herring, it's not the sun.  Obligatory reality check for those who might think you have a point:  http://www.skepticalscience.com/solar-activity-sunspots-global-warming-advanced.htm  &gt; You, too, are bright enough to recognize that our understanding of climate is incomplete. With each percent of uncertainty comes the possibility of overconfidence in a single variable.  When all variables are considered, *even* with the uncertainty taken into account, it's clear that CO2 is the main culprit.  &gt;I've been looking at the issue for several years.  Irrelevant. I've been looking at it since 1978.  &gt;Can you draw a similar line in the sand?  If actual evidence comes out, I'll be glad to revise my position, however I'm not naive enough to tie it to a single metric. If China keeps pumping aerosols in the atmosphere, that won't mean AGW theory is wwrong.  Your attitude about ice extent vs. ice coverage (i.e. focussing on the former when the latter is the important variable) is a good example that you'll let your bias guid your judgement.  &gt;Can you draw a similar line in the sand? It sounds very much like you are looking for reasons to remain a True Believer‚Ñ¢ even if projected warming does not occur.  I'm not a ""True Believer"" (funny how you whine about imagined insults when you have no problem throwing them around - another sign that, despite a carefully-measured tone, you are not being entirely rational in this discussion). I accept the scientific evidence, and thus that current AGW theory is the most likely scenario.  &gt;Who, then, is the more honest of us in this debate?  I am, because I'm not using the cheap trick of a long bet (useless if you don't state publicly who you are, all you have to do if shown wrong is abandon this account). I do not profess to know science better than the actual scientists, and I do not defend unproven theories just because they happen to agree with my personal opinion.  &gt;Have you even followed public opinion? Public opinion favoring AGW peaked in 2009.  You're looking at US polls only. Of course they are lower in the States, as this is where the Koch's anti-science propaganda has been the strongest.  &gt;I don't know what governments you are talking about, but it certainly isn't the governments of the two largest CO2 emitters.  There are more than two governments in the world.  &gt;Ditto  Not at all. I have been quite consistent in my arguments, which are backed by actual science. You like to defend mediocre scientists who have no qualms about engaging in Right Libertarian politics.  &gt;We will indeed. I've already stated my prediction that we will see a cooling of 0.1¬∞C. What is yours?  Mine is that we won't. We'll continue to see the slow increase we've seen in the recent past - although, if you keep on looking at non-significant time periods, the last three years have shown a dramatic increase in temperatures. :-)",‚Ñ¢

The Federation was successfully registered on 26th March 2010 as a membership society under Cap. 108 Laws of Kenya. Our members are ordinary consumers and professionals spread across the country who see the need to support and own COFEK's vision, mission and values.  COFEK works towards a fair, just, and safe marketplace for all Kenyan and regional consumers. We also are keen to see to it that consumers empower and protect themselves. Before COFEK, Kenyan consumers lacked a reliable source of information they could depend on to help them distinguish hype from fact and good products from bad ones. Since then, COFEK has ably filled that vacuum with a broad range of consumer information. To maintain its independence and impartiality, COFEK accepts no outside advertising and no free samples and employs several mystery shoppers and technical experts to buy and test the products it evaluates be it foodstuffs, medicine, phones, laptops, vehicles, machineries and other products.  We have a Governing Council of 20 officials who represent the Federation at the national level. Those Council members are led by the Chairperson, Secretary General and other officials (professionals) heading specific sectors such as Security; Banking; ICT; Roads; Transport; Water; Energy; Agriculture; Education; Tourism; Food; Health and drugs; Supermarkets; Electronics; Environment; Aviation; Automobiles; Insurance; Local Authorities, among others. These officers act as lobbyists and spokespersons in their various areas of expertise. It is especially noteworthy that they give voluntarily of their time and expertise.  They are supported by our lean secretariat staff directly involved in the research and in-house production of the Federation√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s electronic and hard copy newsletter √¢‚Ç¨≈ìConsumer Pride√¢‚Ç¨¬ù. We are also working on various consumer education, protection and business referencing and rating as regards consumers and customer care aspects. We are currently processing various requests from private sector and government agencies on our assessment, through public perception surveys, on their SWOT analysis as regards consumers, customer care, their products and services quality and reliability, pricing, labeling, advertising, distribution, mechanisms of receivinga nd turnaround of consumer/customer complaints, among other attendant aspects.  COFEK will strenuously continue to represent, fight to protect and strengthen the rights of its members and all Kenyan consumers. The achievements are already considerable. We are currently working with the Kenya Law Reform Commission and other stakeholders in finalizing the Consumer Protection Bill 2010. Consumers' rights - the right to information, fair dealing, protection, education - all culminating in the ability to make informed decisions and choices - are and should remain a reality. That is our clarion call. We commit ourselves to remaining true and faithful to this cause whatever temptations and hurdles that may stand in our way.  We are and shall continually be calling on and for Government's recognition of our crucial role through the many lawful ways and means. We expect representation in all regulatory agencies and key public entities such as the Kenya Roads Board; Energy Regulatory Commission; Public Procurement Oversight Authority; Water Services Regulatory Board, Central Bank of Kenya Board; National Environment Management Authority; Police Oversight Authority among others. We are liaising with all professional societies with whom we intend to work very closely and for mutual benefit.  The current income derived from our members' subscriptions is insufficient to permit us to lobby further as we should and the need for determined lobbying and input at home, in Kenya and increasingly, regionally, is vital for the future of consumer protection movement. This is even more urgent now than ever before considering the East Africa Community's Common Market is underway.  We will prevail - of that there is no question - but, to grow is our goal and I hope that you will consider supporting and joining with us in order that we might go forward forcefully and grow quickly. Then we can benchmark and demand for better protection, the clearer transparency and the proper ethical standards - from a position of strength - supported by the majority of consumers - for the benefit of all consumers. We need your support. Join us today!",‚Ñ¢
t5_2qh33,andytuba,1310350029,"Nifty, thanks for the link! Here's my armchair electrical engineer's understanding of the electronic pulse thing:  When you press a key on a keyboard -- for example, ""a"" -- the keyboard transmits a code -- 64 -- via the keyboard cable to the computer's motherboard as an electrical signal, which is then interpreted as the keycode and sent through the OS/software to actually become letters/hotkeys/whatever.  The signal is also emitted as radiation from the cable, which functions as a long, flexible antenna.‚úù  Therefore, you could set up another antenna with a receiver to pick up the radiation, and decode it into the actual letters typed on the keyboard.  Think of it like a crappy radio transmitter/receiver, but with keycodes instead of FM audio signal. [meyowrawr](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/ilrus/clever/c24tcd4) actually found [some guys who did this](http://lasecwww.epfl.ch/keyboard/).  ‚úù Those cables aren't particularly well-shielded; there's very little power going through them.  You could probably ""type"" letters by waving a magnet near your keyboard cable, although I wouldn't recommend it.  EDIT: From reading the article I linked to, it looks like the EM radiation comes from the keyboard itself; so if you have a wireless keyboard with its own power source, same principle applies.  Any certified EEs want to corroborate this or kick it over to Fake Science?",‚úù

t5_2sjdn,siljak,1310550697,"I work with kids with disabilities. We have a zillion guidelines in place and all the usual helpful-minded handouts and literature from charities and organisations, all of them saying how important it is to educate and inform about the effects of bullying, and how victims of bullying should deal with it etc etc.  None of it is worth a damn to the kid in the street who is being called a feeb or a mong or a retard or a spaz every day and worse, wherever they go, whatever they do. Just like you, by the time they reach their teens they have already tried every single way in the world of trying to deal with people's prejudices and seen them all fail one by one. They already know that most of the so-called anti-bullying techniques just make things worse.  When I'm talking to kids about it privately I tend to just tell them about similar shit that happened to me along the way, give them a few jokey anecdotes and try to get them to see that however sad it may be, the simple fact is that they won't see the world's attitudes change quickly enough to help them day-to-day right now, but if they keep trying their whole lives they may make it slightly better in the long run. However...   The one thing you do have the ability to change instantly is your own attitude.You can do that in a matter of days, weeks or months. So you have to start working on finding ways to prevent the depressing, demoralising, relentlessly grinding shittiness of other people effecting you. You can't change THEM, but you CAN learn to accept the sad simple fact that a huge number of the human population are ignorant arseholes. All you can do is to learn to protect yourself from letting yourself be affected by them. Learn to gauge your self-worth by the way the people you respect see you instead. Why do you care about the opinions of ignorant fuckwits?   The tricky bit is finding out what the particular way is that will help you change your own attitude to the bullying. It depends on the individual. Some people can just compartmentalise their lives, some people increase their self-worth by achieving success in some chosen field, some people do volunteer work with disabled kids to make them feel they have at least one thing worthwhile to contribute to the world (well - it worked for me ‚ò∫). The important thing is that you stop looking at yourself as being judged (or even judgeable) by ignorant fools and start seeing yourself as beyond their reach.  tl:dr - Fuck 'em.",‚ò∫

The term ""prescription diet"" is a trade mark of Hills meaning no other dog food company can use it.

Instead Hills just agrees not to sell the food to anyone but Vets and they are allowed to keep around 40% of the price.   Their prescription diets are almost the same ingredients as their normal crappy food with extra vitamins added.

So far so good.  If I can stick with it long enough, I'd like to get back to where I was 5 years ago - benching 300+ lbs and squatting ~400 lbs.  *Running* - I was working with a running coach for 12 weeks this Spring.  The workouts progressively became longer and faster.  It basically came down to running 4-5x per week, with 1-2 easy or progressive runs, 1 quality workout (intervals, speed or hills) and 1 long run.  Worked wonders!    *Stretching* - I need to get better at this.  I have several stretching/foam rolling plans that I need to follow - both for flexibility and for health reasons.  *Diet* - decidedly paleo.  I have done Atkins in the past with great success (dropped from 205 to 175 lbs), but I feel it's non sustainable long term.  Keto appears to be very similar to Atkins.  Paleo, on the other hand, is very simple and more sustainable long-term due to fewer carb restrictions.  The goal is to not eat processed junk and focus more on low GI foods.   **YESTERDAY**  Started off as a decent day.  Ran in the morning, had a good lunch.  Then I made the mistake if having a drink on the way home on the commuter boat and all hell broke loose.  I went into carb craving overload, and had chocolate, chips, and other decidedly non-paleo food.  Now today I feel like crap - tired, bloated, can't concentrate.  Ack.  **TODAY**   No running today - day off.  If I find the energy, I'll make it down to the gym to do 5/3/1 day 2 weights (deadlift and military press).  If not, I'll sit here like a bloated sack of Nox. **‚ò†**  ",‚ò†

t5_2qhqb,Talonwhal,1310668835,"&gt; airsure tracking does not mean that it has some device in the package that can be satellite tracked or something - it just means that when it arrives at each point it is scanned - so it has been scanned at the office you gave it into and won't get scanned again until it arrives at the sorting office in Canada  You seem to be confusing this partially with ""International Signed For"". This service is only tracked a few times eg. when it leaves, when it arrives in the other country, and when it's been delivered.  Airsure, on the other hand has slightly more tracking, in 6 stages:   * Post Office¬Æ (for those items paid for and posted at the Post Office¬Æ branch)  * Local mail centre  * Royal Mail International processing centre  * Office of Exchange overseas  * Mail Centre overseas  * Delivery Office overseas  So the OP is quite right in assuming something has gone wrong, there *definitely* should have been tracking updates by now, there is absolutely no way this is being handled correctly regardless of the situation in Canada.  Being mis-sorted is a possibility but they are often caught even if they are mis-sorted initially, however it is possible that it hasn't been caught and has gone with the standard mail as suspected. Then it will end up in the backlog like everything else.  If it hasn't arrived in 25 days then you can claim for it, however unless you paid for additional compensation (up to ¬£500) then you're not likely to get much.. even then it's not exactly the $2000 you seem to have the potential for losing here. You shouldn't really send anything over the value of ¬£500 with this service, I guess.. but too late for that now, so...  It seems Royal Mail are being kinda unhelpful here, honestly - with Airsure and the way it's tracked they should deifnitely at least be admitting that they screwed up either at the Post Office or elsewhere. I'd try calling them or visiting the Post Office again armed with this knowledge regarding the tracking and see what they have to say. Unfortunately as I mentioned even if they lost it completely you won't necessarily get much of the value anyway (although sometimes they are quite generous). They may however be able to investigate and figure something out.  *Edit: Hey, I just realised you're the guy with some comments I read in the ¬£5 in plastic envelope thread - hey!

For one, if you really decide to play it, then it's really fun. But you have to know the rules if you want to play.   Naturals do all these things without having to think about them. ",‚Ñ¢

t5_2cneq,sfudman,1310871477,"Friday, April 1. 2011 Open Letter to President Obama on the Nomination of Elizabeth Warren Dear President Obama:  An interesting contrast is playing out at the White House these days between your expressed praise of General Electric's CEO, Jeffrey R. Immelt and the silence regarding the widely desired nomination of Elizabeth Warren to head the new Consumer Financial Regulatory Bureau within the Federal Reserve.  On one hand, you promptly appointed Mr. Immelt to be the chairman of the President's Council on Jobs and Competitiveness, while letting him keep his full time lucrative position as CEO of General Electric (The Corporate State Expands). At the announcement, you said that Mr. Immelt ""understands what it takes for America to compete in the global economy.""¬ù  Did you mean that he understands how to avoid all federal income taxes for his company's $14.2 billion in profits last year, while corralling a $3.2 billion benefit? Or did you mean that he understands how to get a federal bailout for GE Capital and its reckless exposure to risky debt? Or could you have meant that GE knows how to block unionization of its far flung workers here and abroad? Perhaps Mr. Immelt can share with you GE√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s historical experience with lucrative campaign contributions, price-fixing, pollution and those nuclear reactors that are giving people fits in Japan and worrying millions of Americans here living or working near similar reactors.  Compare, if you will, the record of Elizabeth Warren and her acutely informed knowledge about delivering justice to those innocents harmed by injustice in the financial services industry. A stand-up Law Professor at your alma mater, author of highly regarded articles and books connecting knowledge to action, the probing Chair of the Congressional Oversight Panel (COP) and now in the Treasury Department working intensively to get the CFRB underway by the statutory deadline this July with competent, people-oriented staff.  There were many good reasons why Senate leader Harry Reid (Dem. Nevada) called Professor Warren and asked her to be his choice for Chair of COP. Hailing from an Oklahoman blue collar family, Professor Warren is just the working class hero¬ù needed to make the new Bureau a sober, law and order enforcer, deterrer and empowerer of consumers vis-√É -vis the companies whose enormous greed, recklessness and crimes tanked our economy into a deep recession. The consequences produced 8 million unemployed workers and shattered trillions of dollars in pensions and other savings along with the dreams which they embodied for American workers.  Much more than you perhaps realize, millions of people, who have heard and seen Elizabeth Warren, rejoice in her brainy, heartfelt knowledge and concern over their plight. They see her as just the kind of regulator (federal cop on the beat) for their legitimate interests in a more competitive marketplace who you should be overjoyed in nominating.   Yet there are corporate forces from Wall Street to Washington determined to derail her nomination√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùforces with their avaricious hooks into the Republicans on Capitol Hill and the corporatists in the Treasury and White House.  You have obliged these forces again and again over the last two years, most recently with the appointment of William M. Daley, recently of Wall Street, as your chief of staff.  How about one nomination for the People? The accolades on hearing the news of Elizabeth Warren's nomination may actually exceed the enduring indignation were she not to be nominated. Just feed the Senate Republicans to the mass media that would cover the nomination hearings, all that calm, solid, wisdom and humanity that she communicates without peer. See who prevails.   Selecting Elizabeth Warren and backing her fully though the nomination process will always be remembered by Americans across the land. Not doing so will not be forgotten by those same persons. This is another way of saying she has the enthusiastic constituency of ""hope and change‚Äùthat is ""change you can believe in!""  I look forward with many others to your response.

t5_2r9vp,BrownSugarEffect,1310876789,"No, Seriously this is a good idea.  **Political Science/Public Policy Student**   This is a great idea because one of the effects of drug prohibition is that people feel that they need to be ""in the closet"" about their recreational use. According to drugpolicy.org, people feel afraid and unable to partake in political activism because they fear the repercussions of their admittance of marijuana use from their family and employers. By starting a wave of people 'coming out of the closet,' politicians are more easily able to see that their constituency really does **NOT** support the criminalization.   Comparison: Politics changes with rallies... when the news media covers it ---&gt; the media starts questioning whether or not it should be legal---&gt; Coverage lasts longer than a day or a week ---&gt; a politicians takes this as a hint from his constituency.  **However**  Politics is more likely to change if constituency skips all that bullshit, openly communicates with their House of Reps person **AND** their Senator **AND** convinces more people in their area that they should do the same.

t5_2rxes,smocca,1310945965,"Watching through a games now, I'll give my thoughts as I have them:    *vs. HasuDrone on Typhon Peaks - I don't like your opening.  Everything you do can be fine but you are extremely susceptible to 1 base timing attacks.  I say this because you don't have ling speed, you don't have a third hatch (for mass lings), you only have two queens, you don't have a roach warren, and you don't have fast upgrades.  In other words, you don't really have anything going for you if he shows up with something tricky.  A well microed 4 gate will eat you alive. As will 3 gate+void ray and 3 gate blink stalkers.  Also, the Toss is feeling extremely safe because you can't threaten him at all off creep.  So he's free to get proxy pylons up, free to be greedy or whatever he wants.  So it turns out he's going for 3gate blink stalker and you are going to have to hold this will lings.  Here are some things that you did wrong(ish) which are going to reduce the number of lings you will have to hold this push:  -You have 24 drones mining your main base minerals and only 7 mining your nat (at 9:00). -You only have two hatches.  You cannot make enough lings off two hatches if you have two fully saturated bases.  You were floating enough minerals for a few minutes to easily get a third hatch down and if your drones were distributed better you should have enough. -You saw a bunch of stalkers+zealots and responded by making spines which is reasonable but then you went on getting more gas, getting lair, getting two evo chambers and you also ran away with the lings you had in front of his base.  You have to figure out immediately if he's doing a 1 base attack and if that is the case you just can't afford to be teching so much.  When he is doing a build like this, all of those resources should be going into staying alive. -You made 5 spines and then a few more later.  I like spines, but having a third hatch and third queen and MASS ling is going to be so much better.  I prefer maybe a few less spines and a lot more lings.  Despite all that, you died with 2k/1.5k banked.  So basically your opening gives your opponent this nice window where you are on ling tech (slowling tech, no roach warren, and no upgrades), you are massing drones and you don't have the production capacity to make mass ling if/when you need to.  It just leaves you extremely vulnerable to any sort of 1 base timing attack especially one with tech.  You might do okay vs. 4 gates simply because you usually have to cut drones earlier (and so two hatches+two queens is enough to make pure ling) but this is a later attack that relies on poking in, taking shield damage and then backing out.  He's going to accumulate units until you have a force that can smash his face in.  Given the size of your economy, you'd easily be able to make such a force if you had the production to match.  tl;dr start making a 3rd hatch and and probably a 3rd queen if you want to rely on lings or make an earlier roach warren. Rely less on spines (I ‚ô• spines but I don't think they are enough by themselves).     *Veto Backwater Gulch, Slag Pits and Delta Quadrant (LOL... but seriously though they are awful maps).     *vs. Jason on Shakura's - Weird build from him, he ends up going for 4gate+twilight+robo all on one base.  Your drone distribution can be better again (23 on main and 5 on nat minerals @ ~7:00).  Again your minerals start piling up for a bit since your opening takes a late gas and you're not getting any buildings or anything (3rd queen though, nice).  You see this guy has 4 gates, a twilight council and a robo all on one base (lol) and you go ahead with mass gas, 2 evos and lair tech.  1 evo and possibly the lair are good for safety but this guy is basically all-in.  You can't go ahead with your build like normal.  You are SO far ahead of this guy economically.  All you have to do is be alive in a few mins and it's going to be an easy win.  Only get tech that is necessary to hold whatever attack he may do (like if he tries to get really tricky and grab a dt shrine) and then make the units you need to stay alive.  Your mechanics are good, you're not missing injects much and you are using your larva but it's basically the same story as the other game.  You are on nothing but ling tech and don't have the production capacity to utilize your economy.  Either get a roach warren earlier or get another hatch.  Anyway, this guy's build was so awful that you easily beat it because 4gate+charge+robo+immortals off of one base just means he has like 10 units for his 10:00 timing attack.  tl;dr - Earlier roaches or an early 3rd hatch.  Less tech when you see he is doing a 1 base timing attack.    *vs. SumGai on Shakura's - You taok too much gas too early.  ZvZ especially is extremely punishing of bad macro.  When you end up with like 500 gas and nothing to spend it on that can be SO MANY DRONES.  Anyway, his macro was much worse than yours.  You just didn't have an OL positioned outside of his base to see his 17 lings move out.  As a result, those lings did way too much damage and then he followed it up with a roach/ling attack which you again missed until it was on your side of the map.  Work on that OL positioning and try to tighten up your opening so that you are only getting gas as you need it (and using the excess minerals well).   ---  GL, hope some of this helped!   edit: holy shit wall of text.  sorry lol",‚ô•

t5_2qh1i,GerkSprongle2,1310962400,"Please state which books preferably with a link,in the meantime here's another magic survivor tale.  Benjamin Piskorz has a tale. Benjamin was a jew who dressed himself in a German SS uniform and killed Germans every night in the Warsaw ghetto.   The Germans, being poor sports about such things, arrested Benji and his momma. Benji was wearing his stolen SS uniform when he was arrested. He does not say what momma was wearing   The Germans threw momma into a fire, alive. Momma only had time to make a short speech after being tossed into the fire, before she went silent.    Then the Germans tortured Benji to try to get him to rat out the other jews who went about at night, dressed in SS uniforms, shooting Germans. The form of torture was to nail his tongue to the floor. Of course the Germans learned nothing from Benji, because not even a teller of a Holocaust ‚Ñ¢tale can talk with his tongue nailed to the floor.     Even though you might think that an enemy combatant, caught wearing a German SS uniform would be summarily shot, that is not what happened. The Germans sent him to Treblinka.   There were 140 jews in the cattle car Benji rode to Treblinka. He knows, because he counted them. During the long train ride to Treblinka---it is 50 miles from Warsaw to Treblinka---Benji became so thirsty that he had one of his fellow jews urinate directly into his mouth. Benji said all the jews drank that way. He said the warm piss took all the heat out of his tongue, and gave him great relief.   When he got to Treblinka, the Germans asked if any of them spoke German. Had Benji read Yankel Wiernik‚Äôs book, he would have kept his mouth shut, because Yankel said that all the jews who admitted to being German speakers were immediately liquidated.     Benji said that there were 120 of them who spoke German. Then he says in the next breath that all 300 of them were sent to Majdanek. Here we may have the solution to the age-old problem of the great number of survivors, some 4.3 million of whom have signed up for reparations from Germany. If there are 300 survivors out of an original contingent of 120 German-speaking jews from Warsaw, it is easy to have 4.3 million survivors out of 6 million. Here we have 300 more jews who survived Treblinka, of which I knew nothing before.    At Majdanek, the German leader ran over the jews with his horse in the street and trampled them to death. Horses won‚Äôt normally step on a human lying on the ground, but this was an evil Nazi horse, specially trained to stomp jews.   When the top German got bored with riding his horse over jews, he lined them up two abreast in the street, and ran over them with his automobile. Benji survived both the horses and the Mercedes.   At Majdanek, this former guerrilla, who killed Germans every night, while wearing a stolen German SS uniform, was put to work on the street cleaning crew, where he was given the run of the town, and saw everything that went on in the town.    Then Benji was sent to Auschwitz, where he was transferred to the Buna rubber factory. In the rubber factory, he was employed as a locksmith. German rubber factories are unique in all the world in this regard, since there is no record of a job classification of ‚ÄúLocksmith‚Äù in any other rubber factory anywhere in the world.    Benji had it pretty good at Auschwitz, because he was a friend of the jew who conducted the death camp orchestra, and a skilled locksmith. Then the Russians came, and everything went to hell in a hurry. The Germans death- marched him through the snow and frost for 14 days, without any food or water. He ate snow for his thirst and luckily for Benji, there was grass growing in the frost and snow for him to eat.    Many more remarkable things happened to Benji after the death march, but my old fingers are tired of typing. The entire tale is here: http://voices.iit.edu/interview?doc=...ay=piskorzB_en   Benji's tale is one of nearly a hundred, recorded by Professor Boder,of the Illinois Institute of Technology, in 1946, when memories were still strong. The interview continues for many pages, through several death camps, including Treblinka, Majdanek, and Auschwitz, but there is no mention of gas chambers anywhere. Had the interview taken place 50 years later, that would surely have changed, but, at the time of the interview, Steven Spielberg was still in his mother's womb, and therefore there were no gas chambers.",‚Ñ¢

t5_2qhba,SkyMuffin,1311001428,"**Did you ever get closure from your brother?**  No, not yet. Or maybe not ever. I have come to realize that forgiveness is much more about forgiving yourself than the other person-- my brother no longer has power over me, and so to hinge my health and healing on him is to give up my self control. I would like to someday talk to him and to my mother honestly about this, but I don't think that any of us are ready yet. It may be years before we can.  **Did your family ever believe you or do anything about the abuse?**  I know that my mother believed me, but because she was in a tough economic/racial situation (see responses to question #6 above), she had to act as if she didn't. I don't think my brother realized fully what he was doing at the time. Because my family is so small (literally 3 people including myself), there was no way the abuse could ever happen again after it was revealed.   **Has this affected your adult relationships?**  Yes. I'll quote the response I posted in the other thread:  &gt;I have been blessed to have (so far) two partners after I fully realized what happened to me who were really open and understanding. The first came from a very sheltered, privileged background, but she was open and really cared more about me as a person, and not any outside stereotypes. It was, however, hard on our relationship because she couldn't understand my experience or why I sometimes felt unsafe/like a terrible person for ""no reason at all"". She did tell me that my blog has helped her to understand a lot. The second person (whom I am currently still with) was also abused as a child, and so we try to help each other. Her situation was much more extreme than mine, but we both deal with issues of PTSD and safety when it comes to love and sex.  &gt;My mother has read my blog-- I accidentally revealed it to her-- and now I regularly talk about it openly on my Facebook. I have not heard anything from her except one comment about how there is nothing wrong with me, she loves me very much, etc. I think that she is still trying to deal with/understand this for herself. I get the feeling that we are a bit distant currently because she does not know how to approach it. I don't know if my brother has seen my blog, but I do wonder/worry about him. I still care about him even though he hurt me, but I don't know if I am ready to talk to him yet. I think that he needs counseling/therapy but I don't know if he is doing that.  &gt;On Facebook in general, I don't generally see much response from people-- maybe because I am a bit of a recluse. I am friends with mostly women in real life, and most are very understanding. Sometimes I meet people and share this with them, and they just disappear afterwards without saying much. I think maybe it scares them, but who knows? Maybe it's just regular drifting apart.  &gt;I only have a few friends who are men, but I am close to them-- they have heard some parts of my story, but they generally don't empathize much. The most I have heard from my best friend who is a guy is that ""you are so much braver than me"", which does mean a lot. However, it is harder to talk about these things with other men in person. I have wanted to tell a professor who is a role model/mentor of mine for some time, but I don't know how to approach it.  I am generally much more cautious about the people, especially men, that I allow into my life. I am still trying to figure out how to have male role models and male friends in my life and not see them as a source of danger.  I have also struggled some with even being attracted to men at all, despite considering myself pansexual, just because the thought of a penis terrified me for awhile. I used to really loathe my own penis, too-- my first sexual partner helped me to overcome that a lot.  **How many of your present problems do you believe are partially or fully caused by your past trauma?**  When I was younger (around the time of the abuse) I had a lot of problems with Binge Eating Disorder, which is finally official in the DSM. I would have episodes of overeating, feel incredibly guilty, and gain weight. It was definitely an emotional cause/a poor coping mechanism. I don't do it as often but I have to be careful.  Around the same time, I suddenly started [pulling my hair](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trichotillomania) regularly, and eventually I had bald spots in various places (including between my legs and my armpits). The Trich mysteriously phased itself out after a year or two, although I do it sometimes.  I occasionally make impulse purchases, and I have a (somewhat) compulsive need to collect certain things, but I'm not sure how much of that is influenced by what happened. I do deal with some symptoms of PTSD (nightmares, safety issues, reaction to loud noises or people, fear of small spaces), but they don't happen all of the time, or at least not in extremes. Maybe a few times a week. Sometimes when the issue of sexual abuse comes up in public or social situations I get very claustrophobic and I suddenly feel as if everyone in the room is out to get me.   I am still struggling with having productive, safe coping skills and stress management-- usually when I am stressed, I ""shut down"" and ignore the problem(s), making it worse. This is bad for homework mostly, but I've had a lot of understanding professors.  **You are very brave to do this and I hope you can overcome any way that these awful events affect your adult life.**  Thank you. ‚ô• ",‚ô•

t5_2r7yd,jehjoa,1311008344,"Wow, great reply! The reason you're reluctant to post your own code is the same reason I did post mine. I also lack confidence in my code but I figured a way to improve it is to let more knowledgeable people have a look at it and follow the good advice.  All of the points you made are very fair, let me see if I can address them one by one.  * Yes, I realize this code isn't very portable, which I guess is what you really meant when you said that it relies heavily on the WinAPI and non-standard types. It's true, but I didn't really care about portability, since I personally only use Windows anyway. This is basically what you get when you follow the MSDN documentation. Also, I like to keep my programs as small as possible ([Small is beautiful](http://www.grc.com/smgassembly.htm)), so why would I bloat my .exe with another CRT function (mbstowcs) when I can dynamically link to a function that basically does the same thing (MultiByteToWideChar)? Yes, I statically link to the CRT because I want my code to Just Work‚Ñ¢ on other PC's, and it happened one too many times that the correct MSVCRT DLL wasn't available.  * I see what you mean about my parseResponse function. I agree it's very repetitive and that's usually a sign that there's a better way to do things, but since it isn't that long I didn't care. I never thought about your solution, which is very nice. I will probably change it soon.  * About the way I handled networking, once again you're right. I know what I do isn't really the correct way to handle connections. I should've looped on recv() until it returns 0. I have done this in other little pieces of code and I found that recv() very often waits for a pretty long while before returning 0 which I wanted to avoid in this case. I could switch to using non-blocking sockets, or put all networking code in its own thread but I'm not really sure how to ""design"" my code around this limitation. Perhaps you could share some insights on this? Actually now that I think about it again, since I send along the Connection: close header it shouldn't take long for recv() to return 0... I'll try it out!  * About line lengths, I would've agreed with you several years ago when people were still working on 4:3 monitors in 1024x768 resolution or worse. But now that many of us use 16:9 monitors in full HD resolution (1920x1080!) I don't really see the problem with it. I have no issues reading any of it.  Thanks again for taking the time to write that lengthy reply! It's exactly what I was hoping for. When I get the time I'll improve my code (feel free to add more criticisms!) and perhaps update this post.",‚Ñ¢

t5_2qh68,thedarkerside,1311009647,"Looking through the linked document, the word ""unreported"" comes up three times:  &gt; One way to estimate the extent of crime that is not reported to police is through the GSS victimization survey.  Because the GSS asks a sample of the population about their **personal victimization experiences**, it captures information on all crimes whether or not they have been reported to police.  The amount of unreported victimization can be substantial.   For example, the 2004 GSS estimated that 88% of sexual assaults, 69% of household thefts, and 67% of personal property thefts were not reported to the police.  As a result, victimization surveys usually produce much higher rates of victimization than police-reported crime statistics.  Here's a problem, what are these questions? ""Have you ever been sexually assaulted? If so, did you report it to the police?""  That's a pretty wide question and doesn't really indicate anything about the crime, the seriousness of the crime or even if it would have been considered a crime by the Justice System. So the numbers should be taken with a serious lump of salt.  &gt; **Young victims least likely to turn to police** &gt; A victim‚Äôs age and sex are also linked to the likelihood that a  violent incident will come to the attention of police.  Similar to  the 1999 survey, young victims were the least likely to contact  the police for help, with 24% of incidents involving victims aged  15 to 24 years being reported.  This proportion is lower than  the reporting rates for older age groups.  &gt; Women reported their violent victimization to police in 26% of  incidents, compared to 38% of incidents involving men.  The  lower rate of reporting for women may be driven, in part, by the  fact that women were more often than men the victim of sexual  assault, which is the offence most likely to go unreported.  Again, this harks back to the GSS survey.  I can't really put the last one in here because it's a graph, but if you go to the document the reasons given as to why they didn't report it was rather enlightening, the top three reasons are:  1. Not Important Enough 2. Police couldn't do anything 3. Dealt with in another way  43% said it wasn't important enough, so almost half of the unreported crime didn't even bother the victim enough to do something about it, followed by 25% who said the police couldn't do anything.   Lastly: What exactly is getting ""tough on crime"" and building new jails going to accomplish if the perps never even enter the system in the first place?  It's a waste of money, time and resources just so that The Harper Government‚Ñ¢ can look good to a few senile old farts who are afraid of their own shadow.",‚Ñ¢

t5_2ryd5,zedoriah,1311204508,"&gt; In true atheism (There is no higher standard, everything that exists, exists here and now in the physical world),  Atheism is simply the lack of a belief in a god or gods; it is the rejection of the claim that a god or gods exist.  That's it.  There is nothing else to it.  Yes, most atheists are naturalists, materialists, etc., but it's not required (yes, there are atheists who believe in astrology and other nonsense as well.).  So you can't tie anything other than ""I don't not believe that a god or gods exist"" to ""atheism"".  I'm not sure what you mean by ""weaker"" when you say ""weaker humans"" and ""weaker genes""?  Physical strength?  What about *smart* people that aren't very strong?  What about people with disease resistant immune systems?  One of the strengths of a species comes from it's genetic diversity.  So any decision where you arbitrarily restrict genetic diversity is a ""Bad Idea‚Ñ¢"".  You don't need a religious basis to see that you can suffer.  And it doesn't take a genius to see that others can suffer.  From you own person experience you can see that suffering is undesirable, it's bad.  As social animals empathy is built into us; the ability to feel the suffering of others.  Once you have all this together you can easily come to the conclusion that causing others to unduly suffer is wrong, as it would be bad if someone caused you undue suffering.    Completely without religion you can come to the conclusion that you shouldn't do to others what you wouldn't want them to do to you.  No religion and we get the golden rule (a rule far older that judaism, btw).  With the knowledge that suffering is bad, then it's not hard to see that alleviating suffering is a good thing.  That kindness and compassion are good.  That decreasing suffering in the world is good.  (I wanted to get this in, but couldn't find a good segue into it:  Additionally with any empathy seeing other people suffer could also be considered a type of suffering yourself.  When an empathic being sees something bad happen to another, it hurts.  I mean can you watch a video of people torturing animals?  It makes me physically sick, I actually hurt when I see it.  Reducing the suffering in others reduces my own suffering.  It's a bit more ""selfish"" in a way, but the end result is mutual cooperation and care.) ",‚Ñ¢

I soon found myself *feeling* these feelings that felt very strange-like, a bit like a fleeting feeling facsimiles fractured for five French factory workers who wanted Wesley Welpington, who was wearily working while wastingly wrapped with warnings by Big Bil: Boss-Man.

Examples of innovative segmentation models To fulfill future segmentation requirements, psychographic and behavior-based models become significant. Characteristics such as lifestyle, values, social standing, media usage, buying patterns, brand preference, product usage pattern, and the like can be used to describe customer groups. One example for a state-of-the-art segmentation model is the Sinus-Milieus¬Æ approach, which clusters homogeneous groups by shared aspirations in life, value systems and lifestyles. When individuals share similar life contexts, they are likely to be part of the same milieu. The model distinguishes several milieus and builds a quantitative conclusion through a representative sample of the given population.  If you think the same image wasn't marketed to the ""gangsta"" types, you'd be mistaken.  It is quite common to target a small but highly watched/respected/followed group with the goal of gaining influence over those that ""follow"".  They are called ""trendsetter groups"" and marketed towards very heavily.   An example of this would be putting a new iPad in every Oscar nominee's ""gift"" basket.

This is born out by the subtotal amount.      Subtotal:  	$59.99  There is nothing, **NOTHING** in the email which indicates that the total price for the game is $59.99 and $5 is due now.  Furthermore here's what it shows on the order page:      Star Wars‚Ñ¢: The Old Republic‚Ñ¢ (Pre-Order)     Standard Edition$54.99     Pre-Order$5.00     SUBTOTAL$59.99      Again, there is **NOTHING** on that page to indicate that the pre-order charge is anything other than additional charge.  In fact it clearly states, *""If your request is successful, your credit card will be charged for the pre-order. Your card will be charged for the price of the edition you ordered when the game is released.""*  Finally here's from the mail with my key:      Product SKU: 71065     Product Name: STAR WARS(TM): The Old Republic(TM) Digital Standard Edition Pre-Order     Qty Ordered: 1     Amount: $5.00               Product SKU: 71074     Product Name: STAR WARS(TM): The Old Republic(TM) Digital Standard Edition (Pre-Ordered)     Anticipated Released Date: Targeting Holiday 2011     Qty Ordered: 1     Amount: $54.99      Again, **NOTHING** on that email to indicate that it is anything other than an extra charge.  &gt; If you choose not to read anything at all on the pre-order process page then it is possible you would miss that.  So far I have read the pre-order process page, my confirmation email and the email containing the actual key.  So 3 pages which show it as a separate charge.  Your contention is that even though I looked through 3 pages of verbage where there is no indication that the charge isn't separate from the total sale I am to look at a fourth page, which also doesn't explicitly state it (only implicitly), that *I* am the one who is lacking?  Esp. when it is trivial for them to to make it abso-frakking-lutely crystal clear by a change of verbage on any of the 3 pages to something like:      Standard Edition: $59.99     Pre-Order: $5.00 (Due now)     Remainder: $54.99 (Due later)  &gt; Learn to read before being a smug bastard on reddit?

All the instructions you need to join are printed below.  We are inviting you specifically because we think you have a great interest in the Battlefield series, and because we think you understand the technical issues that might arise this early in a game's development cycle.  The purpose of the Battlefield 3 Alpha Trial is to do a number of server-related tests in preparation for game launch, including load testing our back-end. We are also looking to you to provide us with any feedback on the entire Alpha Trial experience.  Please note that this is not the Open Beta due in September, it's not the Beta promised to buyers of Medal of Honor‚Ñ¢ Limited Edition and this is not a public demo. This is a highly tech-focused Alpha Trial that does not represent final quality of the game. Performance at this early stage of development will potentially be choppy and far from optimal, and we will bring the servers down at our leisure if needed. There will be periods of downtime and periods when we run tests that will negatively affect the performance on the Alpha Trial servers (leading to lag and rubber banding, etc.).  The available slots are limited, so make sure to redeem your unique Alpha Trial code before they run out (see instructions below).  If you choose to join this Alpha Trial, please do not publically post information, images, videos or your impressions of it. If you have any questions or concerns, please leave your feedback directly to us at DICE in the closed Alpha Trial forum we have set up specifically for this purpose.

t5_2qh1i,CoyoteGriffin,1311357217,"https://rational.org/index.php?id=1  &gt;When Lois and I decided to create a better path to addiction recovery back in 1985, it seemed we could improve on what already existed ‚Äî the recovery group movement and its business arm, the addiction treatment industry. We launched a network of recovery groups based upon the idea that addiction is a psychological hangup which can be overcome through group discussions of psychology. We linked strongly with the addiction treatment industry by recruiting hundreds of professional counselors to oversee local groups.  &gt;The network spread into a thousand cities, and participants in recovery joined together in the evenings, away from their families, socializing with other local substance abusers. They kept coming back year after year in a quest for sobriety based upon emotional comfort, inner peace, self-understanding ‚Äî plus the far-off hope of eventually resuming a moderate degree of self-intoxication.   &gt;Finally it became obvious that nothing had really changed, that Rational Recovery groups based upon psychology were simply a different flavor of a ‚Äúspiritual‚Äù doctrine created long ago by and for addicted people. Group facilitators even boasted of causing ‚Äúhumanist conversions,‚Äù meaning the agenda reached far beyond defeating addiction into evangelistic atheism.  &gt;Having been seriously addicted for many years myself, I finally understood that any means of recovery devised by addicted people will necessarily preserve and extend addiction. The RR groups had merely substituted humanistic psychology for religion, and perpetuated the addict-centered approach we now call recoveryism. This piercing insight brought about the end of the Rational Recovery groups as well as severance from the addiction treatment industry.  &gt;Rational Recovery today is family centered. Our flagship, Addictive Voice Recognition Technique¬Æ (AVRT¬Æ), is based upon universal family values, and the addicted family member gets only the support which his own family sees fit to provide. Often this means no support, which is fine, because addicts are not disease victims but traitors to their families who must earn respect through prolonged abstinence.",¬Æ

I used one of those single blade Bic razors, I think I got 12 for .99.  The stand was free because I made it http://www.instructables.com/id/Make-Your-Own-Razor-and-Shaving-Brush-Stand/#step1  The brush, bowl and soap I got from Rite Aid for $5.99 for everything (regularly 10, it would have been worth it!)  The Real Shaving Co stuff was $4, regularly 5 I think.  It's pretty awesome!  I also own C.O. Bigelow  (proraso) and it's nice, but I think after 3 passes and a preshave the eucalyptus gets to be a bit much (it can irritate skin or eyes)  Personally I love the smell of eucalyptus, and there's an addition scent in there that I'm not sure on.  Not bad in any way though.  If somebody wanted to get into this way of shaving for the cheap I would probably say RSC cream, vintage Gillete, Tweezerman brush, 10$ sample blade pack.  And then some form of aftercare.  I've got 3 products in house right now,  Gillete after shave balm, the ever popular Nivea, and the ever awesome Baxter of California after shave balm as well.  I would say if you're going to splurge on ONE thing in shaving..aftercare is it.  And the Baxter was a much larger tube than I expected for the price...so really not that expensive!  I started out my wet shaving career using the single blade bics, VDH soap, mug, and brush.  Gillete (the cheapest I own) after shave balm.  I had 0 nicks or cuts, 1 weeper that didn't have to be treated at all, and my skin was pretty much on fire.  Do keep in mind that I grew a beard for 6 weeks less than a week before so I expected my sensitive skin to be irritated.  After a week of this I stepped up to the RSC/COB soaps, and tried nivea and baxter.  They made the experience nicer, but my skin had mostly cleared up just from being used to the routine, as well as the excellent pre and post care really healing my skin!‚ô¶",‚ô¶

t5_2qi32,bamboozelle,1311400119,"I haven't been to a lot of the restaurants in Knoxville.  All the restaurants listed here are locally owned or chains originating in this area.  I'm all about supporting the local economy.    * Best Italian:  Naples.  They have very interesting specials, and it's one of the few places where I regularly order the specials.  Their ""classic"" Italian pasta dishes like the manicotti and cannelloni are wonderful.  I often get my roomie to order one, and I get the other, so we can mix the flavors.  Yummmmmnomnomnom.  * Best Chinese: Hong Kong House.  Their dishes are remarkably authentic, but they also have American Chinese food, and the best lao mien and pan-fried noodles.   * Best Gyro:  I know eff-all about Mediterranean cuisine, but Mediterranean Delight in Oak Ridge makes the best gyro.  It is in an old office complex, and you can barely tell it's there.  The venue is shabby, but delivers the best damn gyro I have ever eaten.  The bread was super thin and perfectly grilled, oh I just can't describe, the way it was rolled all together, the layers.  Fantastic and subtly different than other gyros, and it's for the better.  A notable second is Nero's on campus.   * Best Fine Dining:  RouXbarb on Northshore.  Their menu is seasonal and changes often.  It's wonderful.  Sit at the Chef's Table, and bring beer for the chef.  He'll take excellent care of you.  Peerless is also very nice.   * Best Mexican:  this is tough.  El Charro is a staple of Knoxville, for their 2-taco lunch special if nothing else, but is sometimes inconsistent.  I also have come to like SoccerTaco in Market Square, but not so much the Bearden location.  I've also come to be a big fan of the carne asada soft tacos at Cancun's off Cedar Bluff (and they actually have a proper bar).  * Best Pizza:  also tough.  Big Ed's Pizza is legendary in this area.  I can't even think of anyone I know that doesn't **love** Big Ed's.  Great crust, and pizza is consistently awesome every time.  Roman's in Windsor Square has been a perennial favorite of mine for close to 15 years (NY style, but not as thin as it could be).  I ‚ô• NY Pizza is decent, but the sauce/cheese/crust proportions are not my favorite, but it's good quality and very tasty.  The venue is also fun.  Dazzo's on Gay Street makes damn fine thin crust NY style pie, and it is fast becoming one of my favorites, second only to Ed's.  Can you tell I like pizza? * BBQ:  TD's makes the best Brunswick Stew I have ever eaten and I used to live in Savannah so I've had all kinds.  OMG it's so amazing.  M&amp;M Catering can work a pork butt on a smoker, for sure, but last time I went it was still take-out only.  But please don't let that stop you.   Calhoun's is a local favorite also, but I prefer their lemon grilled chicken.  They used to have a dynamite happy hour M-F with $1.85 home-brewed pints, but I haven't hung out there in a while so I don't know if that's still going on.  They do have trivia games that draw a lot of people.  * Best Steak:  Ye Old Steak House knows how to handle a cut of meat, and they cook a steak to proper temperature as ordered.  Casual venue, but the menu is all √† la carte and a wee pricey, but I'd guess it's a better value than Ruth's Chris (I have never eaten at Ruth's Chris).  I also really like The Chop House (excellent chops of beef, pork veal, and lamb).  Peerless is quite good also.   * Best Southern comfort foods:  Big Fatty's in Bearden.  Fantastic dishes, not a one of them any good for you, except for your taste buds.  * Best Casual Dining:  Pul√©o's Grille.  They make incredible white bean chicken chili, and you can almost guarantee that everyone will find things that they like.     * Others:  Restaurant Linderhof in Farragut is fun and good food if you have time to waste (their service is not terribly snappy).  There are Ethiopian joints on Sutherland and in Farragut.  My roomie has praised them both.  If you're craving Thanksgiving dinner any time of year, hit up Owen's on Kingston Pike near Pellissippi.    **TL,DR:**  RouXbarb, Hong Kong House, Pul√©o's, Big Ed's, Naples, Big Fatty's,  Ye Olde Steak House, the Chop House",‚ô•

t5_2qh13,thedarkerside,1311455837,"&gt; Am I right in thinking the author suggesting the Left are wrong to argue against cuts/austerity measures? Is that what he means by blind faith in the State?  The way it reads to me was that he sort of realizes that the last 30 years of Thatcherism have failed spectacularly but he still can't convince himself that the core of the right ideology has failed.  Instead he is trying to paint it as a transitional ""misstep"" that needs (and will be) corrected by the right.  He is still writing ""The Left‚Ñ¢"" off as useless as they rely ""too much on the state"".  I find that line funny because if anybody has used the The State to their advantage more than anybody else it's the ones he has identified as having gotten us to where we are: The Thatcherites and Reaganites.  Having said that, that at least he is admitting that the policies have failed, and why, may be the first step back from the insanity under which we live right now. I doubt though that it will find traction with the majority on the right. The ones that are leading it will decry any attempt of it and the ""silent majority"" will still look at the alternatives as ""unsuitable"" and ""worse.  Again having said that: There are more and more defections from the right it seems. LittleGreenFootballs in the US comes to mind, a core online piece of the right for almost a decade until he realized what he was supporting / promoting and did a 180. But until this gets into the mainstream media outside of the occasional OpEd I don't think we will see changes.  So, I got a bit sidetracked there. To directly answer the question: Yes, he thinks the cuts and austerity measures (not to mention the inevitable rising of personal taxes) is something he still deems necessary.

I'm not sure where that came from but maybe I was able to compartmentalize that part of my knowledge.  Anyway, I wasn't trying to be a smartass. I was genuinely trying to understand and these people were exploiting my curiosity. **I wanted to believe** and so I did. I didn't know any other way to think as my parents didn't provide any alternative guidance. I'm sure someone to tried to help me see through the lies but their impact must have been minimal since I don't seem to remember.  So off to college I go. I had an especially ""spiritual"" recharge from church camp the summer before freshman year. I think it's because I had a crush on a girl there and I conflated my lovey-dovey emotions with my Christy-wysty ones. Regardless, I stopped going to church while in school because I thought that shit was boring as hell and nobody was there to make me go.  Meanwhile, I had been listening to 311 throughout high school and college. Whether people think they suck or not is irrelevant as the ideas their songs exposed me to were new and different. They spoke of a cosmic consciousness which I interpreted to mean that maybe God was like a big ball of energy out there and we rejoined it when we died or maybe we were sent somewhere else. I wasn't really sure because at that point, for me, anything was possible. This thought process happened after I had dropped out of college and joined the USAF but it all started with hearing the ideas.  I'd probably label myself a deist from the age of 22-27. Although, at the time, I didn't know what a deist was or that it was even a thing. I was pretty determined to figure this god thing out on my own because surely if there was an intelligent being out there that controlled, it would let me know when I was getting close to the **real** answer.  I had a couple discussions with my mother about my ideas. I remember a discussion I had with her where I had shared my thoughts on god/afterlife/etc. on the way home from a dinner out while I was home on leave. I told her what I just described to you and she just looked at me dismissively and said something equally as dismissive.  Fast forward a few years to Christmas 2009, my mom and I are on a long drive to the airport when she busts out, ""You know, you need to find faith before you have kids."" Mind you, I am not married but was living with a girl who I was with for 2 years at the time. I was caught off-guard but I love a good argument so I welcomed the criticism. Unfortunately, I wasn't prepared to defend my position as I hadn't given it much thought for a while. I had more or less given up trying to find a god and figured that whatever happened after death would happen regardless of what I believe. I was an agnostic deist (I would call myself simply ""agnostic"" at the time but I realize that label is not complete now) at this point and had been for a few years,   After the discussion during my car ride, I knew I had to not only clearly define what I believed (if only for myself) but I also had to be able to defend it. I was not going to be the one who was going to get their ass kicked the next time.  I think it is important to note that my maternal grandfather had died in August '09. It was the first time that I had to confront death. I began wondering What really happens afterwards. Something must happened as I was unable to wrap my head around non-existence. It seems so easy now but my head had been filled with so much nonsense that it was hard to conceptualize. I would think about it a lot over the year following that Christmas.  I eventually came to terms with non-existence. It was strange because once I came to terms, I no longer feared death. Not even in the slightest. This was a breakthrough for me. It was from this point on that I was able to look at religious matters objectively. I was still in the mindset that if I was wrong, it wouldn't really matter anyway. And then I rediscovered /r/atheism...  I had been an active redditor since '09 and had frequented the site since '07. I knew about the atheist community here but never really identified with it. My thinking was that it was just as absurd to believe there was no god as it was to believe there was one. The hubris these people is equal to that Christians!  But then I went to /r/atheism, I was finally able to identify with the resentment of the indoctrination, the bullshit excuses, and explanations of otherwise ""supernatural"" phenomenon. The one submission that really got to me was about emotional manipulation. A comment was posted that talked about low lighting, tone of voice, vocabulary invoked, etc. A memory clicked in my head. I remembered the leader (pastor) of our church camp pulling these shenanigans during the night services. I remembered being in the dining hall with the lights low and he was speaking very softly. I don't remember what he said but I knew immmediately that he was emotionally manipulating ALL of us. There must have been close to a hundred of us. I was fucking pissed and felt betrayed after this realization.  I started spending a lot of time on /r/atheism. I found out about the Atheist Experience. I saw how Matt Dillahunty defined atheism (lack of belief, not necessarily an assertion that there is no god) and was like, ""He that's me!"". It was through that program that I realize that atheism didn't need to be gnostic. I can still say that I don't know but lean towards there not being a god. Everything changed after that. I wanted to know more.  I started coming to /r/atheism more often and I listened to every podcast that the Atheist Experience had posted. I realized that there were other out there like me. Those who had doubts and those who were upset as I was. I felt a connection but...I still didn't have a defense.  Granted, at this point, I wasn't actively looking for one. I was pretty sure that the atheist position was correct already but I have a natural curiousity that led me to read more. I watched [Evid3nc3's deconversion story](http://www.youtube.com/user/Evid3nc3#p/c/A0C3C1D163BE880A/0/mSy1-Q_BEtQ) and was intrigued by the history of the early Old Testament. I started reading more about the history of Old Testament from other sources and came to the conclusion that it's just a bunch of shit that the Canaanites/Jews/whatever made up. It really doesn't matter who they were. They were just people trying to explain the world around them. Once one realizes that the foundations of the Old Testament are bunk, it all falls apart.   That's when I knew I was ready to defend my lack of belief. That's when I realized all religion is just some shit people made up to explain the world around them. Think about it. Even today, people want answers and will suspend any amount of disbelief to satisfy their curiousity. Why would people be any different thousands of years ago? If anything, they would be more suspectible.  We are living in the dawn of a new era. Information is freely available to anyone with an internet connection. I can Google just about anything I want to find and if the there isn't an answer, that's OK. I can live this life just fine with the collective knowledge we have now. Everything else we glean from this planet as a species is just icing on the cake.  This is probably the longest comment I've ever posted. I tried to keep it as brief as possible but it was a very long and involved process. As I understand it, a lot of deconversions happen that way. I hope you got something out of it.",‚Ñ¢

Unfortunately, Mr. Parr has been less than transparent in describing his experience. He is often quoted as saying he only agreed to settle with Monsanto because he could not afford the legal battle. He neglects to mention that:  &gt; Rather than having simply ‚Äúsettled with Monsanto‚Äù Mr. Parr was issued a permanent injunction by the U.S. District Court in Lafayette, Indiana, prohibiting him from cleaning Roundup Ready¬Æ soybeans. Moe Parr had historically received clear communication about the patent law around Roundup Ready soybeans and knowingly disregarded this information by confusing farmers about the law regarding patents. Affidavits from local farmers allege that Mr. Parr misled some of his customers into breaking patent law by convincing them to save patented seed. The injunction also makes clear that Mr. Parr will honor the patent by informing customers it is illegal to save Roundup Ready seed--requiring customers to certify their seed is not a patented product and providing samples to Monsanto for testing.  In other words, not an innocent farmer. He encouraged farmers to violate their agreements with Monsanto.   Monsanto vs White Seed Cleaning  Basically, the same.  Monsanto vs Hendrick Hartkamp  He bought a farm that already had Monsanto seeds. When you buy a business, you can't use materials that they were buying on contracts. Once again, not an innocent farmer whose field was contaminated.  I can't find references to all of the lawsuits, but seeing as they seem to follow the same pattern, i.e. no one has ever presented me with a case of an innocent farmer being sued for accidental contamination, I'm calling bullshit.

t5_2qh03,johndoev2,1311735332,"1) out of curiosity what have you been smoking?  Gow 1:   Processor: Any Intel Core 2 DUO / AMD Athlon X2  RAM 2 GB  Video Card: nVidia GeForce 7600 / ATI X1900  SC2:  **Dual Core 2.4Ghz Processor**  2 GB RAM  **512 MB NVIDIA¬Æ GeForce¬Æ 8800 GTX or ATI Radeon¬Æ HD 3870 or better**   (bolded are the specs that are higher). Though, I'm not sure of the processor of SC2, but I know first hand the Athlon X2 can't have it at medium high. I had to replace my 4600+ to play SC2, while I passed recommended requirements for GoW1 fine. Saying there isn't a gap between the 5 year old hardware that are consoles as opposed to recent PCs, is stupid! You might as well argue Crysis is in the 360 and because Crysis in the PC has higher demands than SC2, 360 can run circles around SC2...  2) The game is not out, I look at the screen shots and videos and simply deem it ""just like any other dungeon crawler"", you on the other hand, see the screen shots and videos and claim it the second coming of God. My verdict came from the same screens and videos we've seen. My interpretation might seem wrong to you, just as your interpretations seem wrong to me. As I said I will have an actual argument about this when D3 does come out, and I might be convinced otherwise at that time. until then any discussions is just like primates deciding whose crap is better.   3) better call every D3 fan who expect it to be different an idiot then, D2 has a huge following and people expect it to be the same. Chances are it will be the same.  Also you know nothing of the eSports scene if you think SC2 was similar to SC1 for easy transitions, if anything it has proven to be a difficult transition as old pros of SC1 aren't doing so well in SC2.",¬Æ

The author's thesis is that, as feminists of the 1970s achieved the goals they appropriately sought--i.e., equality in the workplace and elsewhere in society--ideologies hardened.  Young disputes the feminist belief that the personal is political; what's personal is personal, she claims, and the battle for equal rights is not an excuse for portraying men as fundamentally malevolent."" Although feminists themselves are divided regarding various issues--pornography, most visibly--they share, according to the author, ""a propensity for sweeping statements based on modest evidence.""  Young offers evidence that other basic feminist credos are mistaken: e.g., that male violence is directed primarily against women or that male privilege comes without any price (men die younger, she points out). Young, a journalist who describes herself as a ""dissident feminist,"" contends that rape is not a bias crime.  She also examines the men's movement, where men often take on the role of victim, and what she views as the confused response from political conservatives regarding gender roles.  The 12 steps to an egalitarian society include such seemingly innocuous (but, on examination, distinctly provocative) propositions as ""Take gender politics out of the war on domestic violence"" and ""In politics, stop treating women as an interest group and acting as if women's claims were more legitimate than mens.""

Noir's got lesbians in it. Like, all the lesbians. They don't actually get naked and do the things lesbians do, though.   Also check out **Darker Than Black**, that one's pretty awesome. I can't really explain too much of the plot without being a spoiler, but the basic premise is that cataclysmic events happened and there are people called 'contractors' who've been granted special abilities. It's pretty gritty, and every episode is packed full of awesome. **Black Lagoon** was mentioned down below, and that's like a less fantastical, less sci-fi-y version of DTB. Slightly less awesome, too, but then I might be biased.  If you've got any positive feelings towards 1920's gangster/mafia settings, check out **Baccano!**. The story's well written and you will not regret it. **Durarara!!** was written by the same author, and that explores teenage gangs and stuff in Ikebukuro, Japan, in a modern setting. Both of them have some supernormal elements, and that just makes things really awesome. (Durarara!! also has tons of yaoi shipping moments. Unf, Shizuo/Izaya. ‚ô•.)  Manga-wise, there's **Reiko the Zombie Shop**, but that's really more LOOK AT ME, I'M EDGY, AND I DRAW LOTS OF FUCKED-UP MURDERS.

The author's Junji Ito, so if you like that one-shot, look the rest of his stuff up. **Battle Royale** was mentioned somewhere, and you should check out all the versions of that.   **Higurashi no Naku Koro ni** was recommended, I saw, and that one's pretty gritty too.   Couple of anime movies: **Armitage III** (robots capable of reproduction), **Kakurenbo** (kids' game of hide and seek gone wrong)... and one other, and if I remember it, I will totally get back to you on that. **Steamboy** is less gritty, and more just a recommendation thrown in if you like steampunk stuff.  ...That got kinda long, I'm sorry.

His dating profile and livejournal tell the story of a 29 year old nerd who has some pretty major social problems, with tendencies towards obsession, codependency, delusional thinking, and agoraphobia.  Whenever I research his type (i.e. those that declare war on the MRM), I'm always left feeling *really* bad for them.  They just come off as extremely pathetic, you know?  It reminds me of this poem (or maybe it was a comic) I read a few years ago.  I can't find it online, but it's about this boy who has no spine and so he remains shapeless.  He attaches himself to the girls who do have spines, because he needs the support, but his gelatinous form smothers them and they inevitably leave.  In time, he grows his own, but finds that the girls without spines are now using *him* for support.  He finds this to be unbearable and inevitably leaves them.  It either ends with him realizing that he doesn't need anyone else, or with him finding another girl with a spine...I can't really remember.  I think he's just another Nice Guy‚Ñ¢ (i.e. formless no-spine boy), and he's found that playing the feminist card will attract some of the women who do have spines...the women he needs to prop himself up.

And we are a threat -- we're a threat to every spineless guy who calls themselves ""feminist"" in the hopes that some girl will drop trow for them.

That's how I learned my way around Linux, and it gets you the answers very quickly.  Like kaipanoi said, your biggest obstacle will be getting out of the Windows mindset.   For one, when you want to install something on Linux, you use the distribution's package manager, instead of Googling for the program like you would on Windows (unless the program is unpackaged by your distribution which is unlikely if you use Ubuntu). You will be looking for the ""Ubuntu Software Center"" to install/uninstall any program. The package manager will download the program from Ubuntu's repositories and install it. The great thing about using a package manager is that all your programs are installed, uninstalled, and updated by a single tool.  That should be enough to get you familiar with installing programs The Linux Way¬©. Have fun, and don't be afraid to tinker with your system!",¬©

t5_2qy7t,ropers,1312075745,"If you set up a Windows and Linux dual-boot environment and set both OSes up to be able to hibernate (i.e. suspend to disk; not just sleep), then you might be able to sort of task-switch between your gaming and main OS, as long as you make sure that the boot manager (Grub, etc.) comes in *before* any part of any OS loads.  This would allow you to work away in Linux, then decide you want to play a game, then hibernate Linux, power on again, but instead of restoring the hibernated Linux, you would select Windows in the boot manager and boot that. Then you'd play your game, until you decide you want to switch back to Linux. At that point you'd hibernate Windows, power on again, but select Linux in the boot manager. It should put you back right where you were when you previously hibernated Linux. The next time you'd switch to Windows, you'd also just restore it from its hibernation, and so on.  DISCLAIMERS:  1. This *REQUIRES* that **NO** partitions are shared between the two, or at least that any that might be shared will be unmounted before hibernation from either OS. Otherwise you'd cause an inconsistency. Each OS definitely should NOT know about the other OS's main partition.

t5_2r0cn,Clbull,1312131017,"&gt; this is horrible advice. three years and an engagement ring compared to a silly middle school sounding relationship?  Yeah. My anecdote pales in comparison, I know. And it's a completely different situation compared to being dumped by somebody whom you've built a relationship with for several solid years.  Besides, I read the OP's post and saw no mention of an engagement ring, plus I think you got the length of the relationship wrong.  &gt; really thats what you have to give to this guy?  Explain how my advice of ""Just focus yourself on something"" was terrible?  Why did I say ""Just focus yourself on something""?  Because clearly the OP needs to divert his mind elsewhere to help get over his ex. It's going to take time to recover from something as big as that and while I haven't been in that situation personally. it would make sense to divert your attention elsewhere and try to forget about your ex, improve yourself to the point where you can find somebody truly worthy of you.  I mean don't you remember the usual advice‚Ñ¢ that Reddit gave to handle breakups?  * Cut all contact * Delete from Facebook * Hit the gym  It's the same principle really.  And while there may be some chance chance that she'd get back together if she felt like she made a huge mistake. It's unlikly because she broke the whole thing off because she wasn't happy.  &gt; yeah you sound like youre twelve.  1) It's ""You're"" not ""Youre."" Remember that apostrophes should always be used when trying to shorten phrases like ""You are."" Also remember to start your sentences with a capital letter.  2) Why do I sound like I'm twelve? I thought very little of the relationship after that when she just outright dumped me and realised almost immediately that if she was to do that, she simply wasn't worth it.  3) Grammar nazism aside, I dunno why people are upvoting you for this. You've not only insulted me by assuming I sound like a youngster because of the nature of the (not really) relationship I described but also claimed that my advice was complete bullshit without giving any reason.",‚Ñ¢

What's Yours Like?‚Ñ¢ is the new party game from Patch Products where players share side-splitting laughs while coming up with clever, witty and outrageous clues. Descriptions should be truthful, yet clever, so the player in the hot seat doesn't get an easy guess.  In this game, all players except the one in the hot seat look at a guess word and then creatively describe what theirs is like. They might be telling about their swimsuit, neighbor, closet, hair or any of the other 300-plus words in the game. The player in the hot seat then tries to link all the clues together to figure out what is being described. The best part about this game is that the hilarious clues come from people who play the game. The player who guesses his or her word with the fewest number of clues wins.  What do you think players are describing with these clues?  Mine keeps getting bigger.  I compare mine with others.  My wife likes mine.  I never see mine.  I receive mine once a month.

Its as much a testament to pareidolia and the law of large numbers as it is anything else.  I would be inclined to agree with you there. I'm not accepting at all that it is indeed a sign from god (since I don't believe in one), or truly an ""artifact"" in any religious sense, but it *is* a religious symbol.  &gt; Just because a bunch of superstitious Christians think its a sign from god shouldn't mean YOU think its a sign from god and therefore a sign of their religion.  I don't *need* to agree with them about how or why it got there. It's a religious symbol. It has always been treated as one since it was found. I don't have to believe it's a sign from god to see that it's a symbol of their religion.  &gt; What the shit does that even mean? Who said the objective was to kill a specific religious group? You're adding that whole part yourself.  Believe it or not, there are a lot of ignoramuses in this country who believe that this is a Christian nation, and that Muslims attacked the WTC on 9/11 because they hate and want to kill Christians. This is a false narrative which stupid people have picked up over the last decade. Treating the WTC cross as a ""sign from god,"" as has been done from day one, and erecting it as a primary memorial only reinforces this false narrative.  Incidentally, these same ignoramuses are the ones on FNC's Facebook page making death threats and saying ""fuck the lawsuit, because American is a Christian Nation‚Ñ¢,"" and there are quite a lot of them. I wouldn't *want* to make any of that shit up.   The reality is that Islamists sought to kill American citizens, with no regard for religious affiliation, because they viewed the United States as an imperialist, overextended superpower, as they had hated the Soviet Union for similar reasons.  ~2900 of the 9/11 victims were American citizens, and ~300 of them were foreign nationals from 70 different countries who were caught in the attack during their stint in the states. Why is not easier and more respectful to honor the deaths of thousands of people who were not all Christians by simply putting up their respective flags and their names?",‚Ñ¢

But like I said most of the time it's Frys Dilemma anyway _""Can't tell if cute girl is flirting or just making fun of me..""_.
