t5_2qh1i,jdrake90,1299005985,"I do. There is strong archeological evidence (as in thousands of cave and object paintings) of extremely anatomically correct creatures (resembling dinosaurs we have fossils of) interacting with people. While some of these might be a hoax, like the Icca stones, there are too many - spread across too many geographical areas - to conclude that people consistently imagine or make up artistic creatures that all look the same.  Also, history is full of dragon legends - the word Dinosaur wasn't used up until a couple hundred years ago - if you read descriptions of ""dragons"" that men have killed or attacked throughout history - you find descriptions of creatures that are very similar to dinosaurs we know existed. Again - probably a lot of myths amongst the historical accounts - but too many to discount. Marco Polo, for instance, reported seeing dragons pulling the king's carriage in China:  ""The book,The Travels of Marco Polo, is the written record which chronicles the adventures and travels that Marco Polo experienced while exploring the eastern world. In part 2, chapter 40, Marco Polo reports what he describes as ""huge serpents"". The descriptions given sound in many ways no different than descriptions given of the dinosaurs in the text books.  The following is an excerpt from Marco Polo's book in which he describes a dinosaur:  ""Leaving the city of Yachi, and traveling ten days in a westerly direction, you reach the province of Karazan, which is also the name of the chief city....Here are seen huge serpents, ten paces in length (about 30 feet), and ten spans (about 8 feet) girt of the body. At the fore part, near the head, they have two short legs, having three claws like those of a tiger, with eyes larger than a forepenny loaf (pane da quattro denari) and very glaring.""  The jaws are wide enough to swallow a man, the teeth are large and sharp, and their whole appearance is so formidable, that neither man, nor any kind of animal can approach them without terror. Others are met with of a smaller size, being eight, six, or 5 paces long; and the following method is used for taking them. In the day-time, by reason of great heat, they lurk in caverns, from whence, at night, they issue to seek their food, and whatever beast they meet with and can lay hold of, whether tiger, wolf, or any other, they devour;  ""After which they drag themselves towards some lake, spring of water, or river, in order to drink. By their motion in this way along the shore, and their vast weight, they make a deep impression, as if a heavy beam had been drawn along the sands. Those whose employment is to hunt them observe the track by which they are most frequently accustomed to go, and fix into the ground several pieces of wood, armed with sharp iron spikes, which they cover with sand in such a manner as not to be perceptible.  When therefore the animals make their way towards the places they usually haunt, they are wounded by these instruments, and speedily killed. The crows, as soon as they perceive them to be dead, set up to scream; and this serves as a signal to the hunters, who advance the spot, and proceed to separate the skin from the flesh, taking care immediately to secure the gall, which is most highly esteemed in medicine.  In cases of the bite of a mad dog, a penny weight of it, dissolved in wine, is administered. It is also useful in accelerating parturition, when the labor pains of women have come on. A small quantity of it being applied to carbuncles, pustules, or other eruptions on the body, they are presently dispersed; and it is efficacious in many other complaints.  The flesh also of the animal is sold at a dear rate, being thought to have a higher flavor than other kinds of meat, and by all persons it is esteemed a delicacy.""

Come and share your master‚Äôs happiness!‚Äô     22 ‚ÄúThe man with two bags of gold also came. ‚ÄòMaster,‚Äô he said, ‚Äòyou entrusted me with two bags of gold; see, I have gained two more.‚Äô     23 ‚ÄúHis master replied, ‚ÄòWell done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master‚Äôs happiness!‚Äô     24 ‚ÄúThen the man who had received one bag of gold came. ‚ÄòMaster,‚Äô he said, ‚ÄòI knew that you are a hard man, harvesting where you have not sown and gathering where you have not scattered seed. 25 So I was afraid and went out and hid your gold in the ground. See, here is what belongs to you.‚Äô     26 ‚ÄúHis master replied, ‚ÄòYou wicked, lazy servant! So you knew that I harvest where I have not sown and gather where I have not scattered seed? 27 Well then, you should have put my money on deposit with the bankers, so that when I returned I would have received it back with interest.     28 ‚Äú‚ÄòSo take the bag of gold from him and give it to the one who has ten bags. 29 For whoever has will be given more, and they will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what they have will be taken from them. 30 And throw that worthless servant outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.‚Äô    ---   that being said, Christians tend to voluntarily donate more to the poor, they just don't like being forced to pay more without having say where it goes.   http://abcnews.go.com/2020/story?id=2682730&amp;page=1  ",¬©

t5_2qh1i,aazav,1299386593,"The recounting of my life in a haunted house on Wing Lake Rd. in Birmingham/Bloomfield Michigan. ¬© 1999  Part 1 of 2.  The address is on Wing Lake Rd in Birmingham/Bloomfield Township, Mich.  First or second house on the right when entering Wing Lake Rd from the south.  With a gravel driveway, the house was painted yellow when I lived there in 1982.  At that time, I was a sophomore in HS, about 14 or 15, didn't drink, do drugs and was a normal 15 year old kid.  The first night my family lived in the house, all the lights went out in the house except in the garage below the small attic and the attic.  The door to the small attic would slowly open with a creak and then within a minute, slam shut.  Often, when in the house and after standing still, I would get a feeling like someone cold was walking up behind me and putting their hand right over my shoulder.  Quickly turning around would make the feeling go away then it would settle in again.  Like someone was right behind you and you turn around and they are not there.  When eating dinner, the sound of someone bouncing a ball would be heard over our heads.  Like when you drop a ping pong ball and it quickly speeds up its bouncing but this would go over several minutes.  Twice when entering the garage, a large rusty 3 inch nail fell out of a nailless, stucco ceiling, leveled out and zipped in front of me, hitting the garage divider, bouncing off a box and hit the floor with a ping.  Then it disappeared.  This happened to me twice and to my father once, but he was able to pick up the nail. The amazing thing was that the nail took exactly the same path both times it happened to me.  There was no hole in the ceiling left by the nail either.  A pattern was developing that only these things would happen to men, not women.  I never figured out why until after I had moved out of the house.  We had a yard man who lived in Wayne or Pontiac, Mich and was recently unemployed from one of the car companies.  Curious, I asked him if he noticed anything funny happening to him in the house.  He denied any odd happenings until he was painting the room to the small attic and the radio station changed on him while he was listening to it.  After this experience, he informed my mother that when we had any house work he'd call us, and not to call him.  After a while he calmed down but was pretty shook up.  Twice while sleeping, odd things happened in my room.  The first was reminiscent of the old Pepto Bismol commercials where the man in the commercial would bulge and wobble due to his discomfort.  One night, I woke up in the middle of the night and saw my closet doors doing this.  Realizing that there was nothing I could do to change it, I closed my eyes and went back to sleep.  That to me, is a very strange reaction and after we left the house, we wondered if we were insane to live there for a year.  The second incident was a simple ""there is someone walking in my room"".  I could hear footsteps and boards creaking as if someone was entering my room.  There were no depressions in the carpet and only 3 audible steps were taken into my room.  Again, I just went back to sleep.  While playing on the lake ice with my friend Quigley and his dog, we decided to play at my house.  I warned him that it was haunted but we'd make the best of it.  When we approached the house, it took some effort to get the dog into the front yard but a taunting with a tennis ball eventually got the critter onto the grass.  Finally able to grab the dog, we took him off the grass and onto the front porch where he fought against us strongly.  From there, Kevin took the dog by the collar and I opened the front door.  His dog froze, looked up the staircase inside, whimpered, backed off the foundation taking us with him and almost dragged us off the lawn.  We couldn't hold on and the dog just stayed in the street, never coming close to the house or the lawn.  Baffled and not seeing any spectres, Kevin and I entered the house and got cookies.  After the cookie break, we went upstairs and as adolescents started wrestling and beating each other up.  While wrestling about the room, we fell on my solid pine bed and the bed snapped in half.  Now, I had that bed for 12 years and it had taken a beating but it could have just broken.  Kind of embarrassed, we both went downstairs and Kevin left with his dog.  I had another friend named Justin who had a beer can collection like I did.  I kept mine in the small attic and therefore did not go there much.  Knowing that if I invited Justin over, the ghost would pay more attention to someone new, I told him about the haunted house and we went over to check out my beer can collection.  Justin reacted rather well for the first ten minutes except that I didn't have ten minutes of beer cans to see.  He often got a surprised look on his face and tried to brush something off his shoulder.  Three times I asked him if he wanted to leave until he strongly told me that he would tell me when he wanted to go.  He just walked back and forth between the same racks looking at the same cans.  3  minutes later, he asked to leave.  Going down the stairs, I asked him if he felt the ghost touching his back.  Abruptly, he turned to me and without answering my question, told me never, EVER to take him back to that room again.  Years later, I described to him exactly what happened to him (that feeling from paragraph 3) and he was amazed that I was exactly right. ""Like you're walking down a deserted road with no one for thousands of miles and you know there is someone right behind you.""  Nonchalantly, I told him that I lived there for a year and was well accustomed to the feelings of that house.  When we moved to the house, we had a cat.  The cat would normally be a ""house cat"" and stay around the house with a few late night jaunts.  The critter's behavior changed and it rarely spent time around the house and finally left.  Don't really know why but animals did not seem to like this house.  The problems of living in that house were not shared with our neighbors.  Surprisingly, a neighbor from 3 houses up the block would ask me how I was doing and how things were going whenever he would see me.  Only later, I would realize that he was asking me ""are you doing ok in that haunted house?""  Once, my father and I entered the room next to the room that went to the small attic and felt a presence.  We decided to lighten up the atmosphere and started paying attention to the ghost and actively speaking about being nice to the ghost and maybe ""take a ghost to lunch.""  1/2 hour after we started, without a word, we stopped.  An ominous hostile nature hinting ""stop NOW"" was the general feeling that came about the room.  During that time, the feeling on my back could be shrugged or whisked away with a brush of my hand.  1/2 hour later, we both got up and left.  I asked my father who was a former secret agent and not a wimp, ""let's never do that again.""  He quickly agreed.  Coincidentally, at the time that we lived in the house was when Poltergeist was released to theatres.  I definitely went to see that movie.  After a while, it was obvious to the family that I was having trouble living in the house.  Once I asked my dad if anything happened to him that he hadn't told me about.  He recounted a story of a few weeks earlier where he was sitting on the porcelain throne and the wastepaper basket flew across the room without his permission.  My definition of an area influenced by a poltergeist is if inanimate objects fly around the room without you asking them to.  Continued... ",¬©

Why are people so threatened by Jesus teaching to love your neighbor, how to be a better person,be kind, helps you to be calm in situations, how to handle tuff situations, gives inner peace and promises to be there by your side at every moment.

t5_2qh5b,Lors_Soren,1299551169,"&gt; Could you give some examples of propositions that have moral value and the different moral values they have? For example, I can say ""Obama is currently the president"" has truth-value True, while ""Obama was born in Kenya"" has truth-value False.  Not really because I don't have an ethical theory to put forward. Within the context of some ethical theory if you had a 2-valued algebra the theory would state like ""Janey had premarital sex"" has a value of immoral and ""Amy saved an innocent man's life"" has a value of moral.  Maybe I also want to use a set containing the words ""should"" or ""must"" or ""thou shalt not"" as the image the words maps onto.  Ethicists can go many different directions with this, it's just using the same symbology but instead of {T,F} or {T,F,I} or [0,1] or {T,F,B,N} -- whichever logic system -- there's an isomorphism from {T,F} to {moral, immoral} or whatev.  Sorry if I'm still being unclear. I just don't think or read often about ethical philosophy.  Then there is another, totally different, application of modal logic, which is to express ‚óªx = ""it's obligatory that x"" and ‚óáx = ""it's permitted that x"".  &gt; ... similar ... lesswrong  Indeed, we have been indoctrinated by the same overmasters. I especially liked the post ""Bayesian Judo"" but I try not to read too often, so I don't go there much anymore.  &gt; ctrl+f  http://www.stats.uwaterloo.ca/~cgsmall/ontology.html + Ctrl-F = ""contingent"". There are four modal cases there: necessary falsehood, contingent falsehood, contingent truth, necessary truth.  &gt; sociopath  Zing!  &gt; impractical  Yup, after all this is philosophy.  &gt; bizarre ... how the USA got [its views]  Sounds like it's time for a self post.  &gt; utility ... good  Back to that. Utility is an individual-level concept. Good feels like a macro concept especially in the God context, although it can be applied on a smaller scale. You can say ""That was a good thing you did there"" -- the good act feels somehow an element of the set of good acts.  So it seems natural to me to define good via a map from individual utilities to {good, ..., ..., ...}. This gets around the problem of objective reality and can even stand up to the non-existence of 1-D utility. However this approach fails because Good has to do with intentions as well as outcomes. Sigh.  On a personal note. I think the reason I'm so out of my depth and being unclear here is that I don't personally believe in good or 1-D utility as such, so I'm always reasoning at arm's length ... ""well, if good *were* to exist, what could it possibly be like? how could we logically design something that might fit the shape of what people seem to mean by the word 'good' ?"" Same goes for Pareto comparisons, I make moral choices entirely from the gut and don't try to philosophize them so the ethical theory for me is entirely theoretical.",‚óª

This is one of the central themes of a salvia trip (from all of the salvia reports that I've read)... in one of mine, the wall of my house directly across from my couch began folding into a higher dimension and this gigantic cosmic wheel began rolling out of the opening... I quickly realized that it was my fate to become part of it's tread for eternity (quite disheartening as I had not yet shed my ego and knew what I was about to leave behind).  By the way, I just Googled [this](http://www.google.com/search?btnG=1&amp;pws=0&amp;q=salvia+wheel) for you in case you weren't aware of the prevalence of these types of experiences.  I completely understand what you mean about not afraid of being dead (the perception of having died)... because awareness still remains at that point, it's as if the adventure has just begun.

It's all about residuals.  Also, been on it 3 years, fuck all the time and don't use a condom [I'm in a completely monogamous relationship]. I'm not really advocating that this is for everyone, but it sure has worked for me.

So before downloading, or maybe in your registration with the site, you check your preferences, like:  * ‚òë Show the blowjob scene * ‚òê Show the pussy-eating scene * ‚òê Show actress angrily spitting on his cock * ‚òê Show actor angrily spitting on her pussy * ‚òê Show the guy's face right before he cums * ‚òê Show the guy's face ever * ‚òê Show the shot-from-low saggy-ballsack-swinging man-ass scene * ‚òë Show the facial * ...etc.  So the software would re-cut the video based on your preferences.  And while we're customizing porn, I'm pretty sure it would be technologically feasible, and not particularly expensive, to be able to choose the girl's hair color. You'd just have to have the actress dye her hair some weird color that otherwise won't be used in the scene, like bright green, and then have your software replace any green pixels with the chosen color, whether it's blonde or black or purple or whatever. **Edit:** Or even changing color, shifting smoothly from one to another. That could be a porn movie's gimmick, that there's a girl whose hair changes color depending on her arousal. Sure, that's a weird and not-inherently-hot gimmick, but in porn, novelty sells.  Come to think of it, you could probably choose eye color too if she wore those really brightly colored contact lenses.

(and yes, this is assuming the client's DNS cache is cleared)  On a sidenote, it's fun to mess with your friends by looking up a bad site's IP address and replacing a normal entry with it's IP (like finding out that smut.com is at 44.33.22.11 and putting an entry to www.myspace.com in your hosts file pointing to that address).    Also though, it's used to control surfing in a company.

The results have provided insight into the best conditions for composting this new packaging material. They found that under aerobic compost conditions at &gt;55ÀöC the film structure breaks down very quickly, in about 12-16 weeks. They also found that under anaerobic conditions (similar to what would be found in a landfill) no significant decomposition takes place. This means that the new film would not decompose in a properly maintained landfill.  [Source](http://www.novativemedia.com/green-news/sun-chips.php)",¬Æ

It helps pass the time in an enjoyable way, but it really does not accomplish anything. No ones life has ever been improved by listening to someone else‚Äôs claim that the end is neigh.  Regardless, let‚Äôs take a look at your claim that Japan is the dragon from John of Patmos‚Äô Book of Revelation.   International Standard Version (¬©2008) ‚ÄúThen the dragon stood on the sand of the seashore. I saw a beast coming out of the sea. It had ten horns, seven heads, and ten royal crowns on its horns. On its heads were blasphemous names.‚Äù  First off, there is no dragon in earlier translations. Consider the same passage from the King James Bible.  King James Bible ‚ÄúAnd I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy.‚Äù  One could argue that John of Patmos, not to be confused with the Apostle John, is the Dragon. However, that would mean that the mistranslation was all part of some inscrutable divine plan. But I digress.  You contend that the dragon is not literal. That is a huge leap. You are not the first to make this leap. Futurist interpretations of Revelation were first introduced in the 16th century by Francisco Ribera. Prior to this, the Revelation was viewed as an account of prophecies being fulfilled throughout history. The earliest complete commentary on the book of Revelation was carried out by Victorinus in 300 AD, considered to be one of the earliest Historicist commentators. But, again, I digress.   Let‚Äôs look at your claim that Japan is the Dragon. First off, Japan is not known as the land of the dragon. Japan is more commonly known as the land of the rising sun. The sun is featured on Japan‚Äôs flag. I‚Äôll concede that dragons are a common feature of Japanese mythology; however, this legend of the Japanese dragon has its origins in Chinese myths and folklore. Let‚Äôs consider China.  China has been known as the land of the dragon. It has had a long association with creatures that westerners have called dragons; however, in China ‚ÄúLoongs‚Äù are considered beneficial and magical creatures. They are very different from western dragons. To find a land that is identified with our western understanding of dragons, we should go westward.  The Welsh Dragon appears on the national flag of Wales. The oldest recorded use of the dragon to symbolize Wales is from the Historia Brittonum, written around 820, but it is popularly supposed to have been the battle standard of King Arthur and other ancient Celtic leaders. However, is this dragon from Revelation even a land mass?  From the text it seems clear that the Dragon is standing upon the sand of the sea. This is suggestive of a city or a structure or a person and not a country or land. After all, land standing upon the land is nonsense. The City of London has as her symbol the Dragon.  So, the Dragon of Revelation is John of Patmos, Japan, China, Wales or the City of London. If we squint our eyes a little, the dragon could be King Arthur.  Let‚Äôs try this interpretation on for size. King Arthur is the dragon that stood upon the sands near the sea. There he confronted the great beast with seven heads and ten horns. Rome has seven hills and ten provinces.   In conclusion, attempting to find symbolic or futurist meanings in the writings of someone from the Iron Age is pointless. If there is a god and he wanted us to know the future, then he would have simply provided it to us in a manner that was plain and clear and consistent. Even your own holy book makes it clear that this endeavor is pointless.  Matthew 24:36-37  36 ‚ÄúBut about that day or hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father. 37 As it was in the days of Noah, so it will be at the coming of the Son of Man.  Sadly, there is no geological evidence to support the story of a global flood.

I'm not saying this is good or AT&amp;T aren't dicks, but this is what the contract iPhone users sign when they bought their phones. Whether these things are enforceable is quite another thing.   Because this change could impact the data cost/month, my non-lawyer reading of this:  &gt;IF WE INCREASE THE PRICE OF ANY OF THE SERVICES TO WHICH YOU SUBSCRIBE, BEYOND THE LIMITS SET FORTH IN YOUR RATE PLAN BROCHURE, OR IF WE MATERIALLY DECREASE THE GEOGRAPHICAL AREA IN WHICH YOUR AIRTIME RATE APPLIES (OTHER THAN A TEMPORARY DECREASE FOR REPAIRS OR MAINTENANCE), WE WILL DISCLOSE THE CHANGE AT LEAST ONE BILLING CYCLE IN ADVANCE (EITHER THROUGH A NOTICE WITH YOUR BILL, A TEXT MESSAGE TO YOUR DEVICE, OR OTHERWISE), AND YOU MAY TERMINATE THIS AGREEMENT WITHOUT PAYING AN EARLY TERMINATION FEE OR RETURNING OR PAYING FOR ANY PROMOTIONAL ITEMS, PROVIDED YOUR NOTICE OF TERMINATION IS DELIVERED TO US WITHIN THIRTY (30) DAYS AFTER THE FIRST BILL REFLECTING THE CHANGE. If you lose your eligibility for a particular rate plan, we may change your rate plan to one for which you qualify.  It sounds like people can get out of their contract over this without paying the ETF. Of course, in the US, AT&amp;T has iPhone customers over a barrel because the iPhone 3G will only work on 3G on its network. Moving to T-mobile would mean no 3G.

t5_2qh2p,TheFlyingBastard,1300663601,"** *Part 2: My Childhood, or How To Stunt Children's Development Of Critical Thought* **  Our religious weeks would consist of visiting our local Hall on tuesday evenings and one evening in the weekend for two hours. The thursday evening was dedicated to ""bookstudy"", which entailed a Q&amp;A study of a book written and printed by the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, the organisation behind Jehovah's Witnesses. (Think the Vatican for Catholics, except way more subtle.)   These studies and meetings were pretty boring. Rarely would we hear something new. We were already thoroughly familiar with the Witness doctrines, and these meetings served as a great reminder of what we believed, why, and why everyone else was wrong. There was another layer to all of this that piqued my interest, though. Sometimes the writers of the publications would speak about the original Greek texts. This fascinated me. I wanted to know more about the *world* of the bible. What does the source text say? Where were these cities? What happened scientifically to the Red Sea? My knowledge of the bible was ever increasing - but only within the confines of Witness material and my own speculation.  I went door-to-door once every two or three weeks. Usually I went in the afternoons. After all, didn't want to wake up the poor people who were still in the Church of Bed, right? How unfortunate that not many people in the congregation shared this thought and insisted mornings were the best time, but what can you do. That said, people aren't that spiritual where I lived. Many never gave it much thought. How was I able to use all this in-depth knowledge if people just didn't care? I couldn't get their attention for these things, so when push came to shove, I sucked at it. So I just kept studying the bible. But inquisitive minds are prone to fall into the trap of good information...  -  ** *Part 3: Apolegetics Phase, or Go Bibleboy!* **  I would often talk to other Jehovah's Witnesses about their experiences. Many said they would often feel blessed that they were in the religion that was so clearly directed by God's Holy Spirit. I never did and that raised some questions. Why did spreading the Truth¬Æ never make me feel happy? Was it just me doing something wrong? Why couldn't I spread the good news to people?  So I turned to the internet, where my geekdom would be welcomed and my utter lack of charisma hidden. I subscribed to forums such as CARM (which is the ultimate repository of Christian insanity - you should see it, they've got a secular concentration camp with stickies that say homosexuals are spreading disease. It's amazing.) as well as some other forums in order to spread my faith and defend it from people who spread misinformation about it. Despite the warnings given by the elders (congregational leaders) not to go to these sites, I started participating in discussions with Christians and atheists alike. I needed to know what they thought. How else would I be able to defend my faith while simultaneously decide how to convert them? Know thine enemy and all that.  I identified as a Witness. Immediately Christians hurled abuse at me, calling me a cultist. I ignored them. These people were obviously mentally deficient and could not argue their way out of a wet paper bag. This strengthened my faith; clearly all the stupid people are out there, and all the smart people were Witnesses! But then, there were the atheists. Usually respectful people, who read what I had to say and calmly brought up evidence for their position. Whenever a theist would stop by to proseletyze, they calmly yet firmly refuted the arguments presented. The bible was proven wrong in places. All I could do is look it up on the CD-ROM with Watchtower publications and get a half-assed apologetic explanation. I found the contrast quaint. On the one hand we have the close minded, militant believers, and on the other hand the intelligent, intellectual and thoughtful atheists. It puzzled me; the difference was quite clear.  But I marched on despite this. I would become the voice of reason among the insane theists. I fired up my Watchtower Library on CD-ROM, read an article from the CD and put it in my own words. That way I would understand the point made instead of degrading into cheap copypasting.

There's also a big difference between the levels of behaviour problems of non-remitting and remitting mothers. Children of non-remitting mothers fare much worse in the beginning.  Am J Psychiatry Published March 15, 2011 doi: 10.1176/appi.ajp.2010.10010032 ¬© 2011 American Psychiatric Association  Children of Depressed Mothers 1 Year After Remission of Maternal Depression: Findings From the STAR*D-Child Study  bjective: Maternal major depressive disorder is an established risk factor for child psychopathology. The authors previously reported that 1 year after initiation of treatment for maternal depression, children of mothers whose depression remitted had significantly improved functioning and psychiatric symptoms. This study extends these findings by examining changes in psychiatric symptoms, behavioral problems, and functioning among children of depressed mothers during the first year after the mothers' remission from depression. Method: Children were assessed at baseline and at 3-month intervals with the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children‚ÄìPresent and Lifetime Version, the Child Behavior Checklist, and the Children's Global Assessment Scale for 1 year after their mothers' remission or for 2 years if the mothers did not remit. The authors compared children of early remitters (0‚Äì3 months; N=36), late remitters (3‚Äì12 months; N=28), and nonremitters (N=16). Results: During the postremission year, children of early-remitting mothers showed significant improvement on all outcomes. Externalizing behavioral problems decreased in children of early- and late-remitting mothers but increased in children of nonremitting mothers. Psychiatric symptoms decreased significantly only in children of mothers who remitted, and functioning improved only in children of early-remitting mothers. Conclusions: Remission of mothers' depression, regardless of its timing, appears to be related to decreases in problem behaviors and symptoms in their children over the year after remission. The favorable effect of mothers' remission on children's functioning was observed only in children of early-remitting mothers.",¬©

t5_2saen,TheFlyingBastard,1300723760,"** *Part 2: My Childhood, or How To Stunt Children's Development Of Critical Thought* **  Our religious weeks would consist of visiting our local Hall on tuesday evenings and one evening in the weekend for two hours. The thursday evening was dedicated to ""bookstudy"", which entailed a Q&amp;A study of a book written and printed by the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, the organisation behind Jehovah's Witnesses. (Think the Vatican for Catholics, except way more subtle.)   These studies and meetings were pretty boring. Rarely would we hear something new. We were already thoroughly familiar with the Witness doctrines, and these meetings served as a great reminder of what we believed, why, and why everyone else was wrong. There was another layer to all of this that piqued my interest, though. Sometimes the writers of the publications would speak about the original Greek texts. This fascinated me. I wanted to know more about the *world* of the bible. What does the source text say? Where were these cities? What happened scientifically to the Red Sea? My knowledge of the bible was ever increasing - but only within the confines of Witness material and my own speculation.  I went door-to-door once every two or three weeks. Usually I went in the afternoons. After all, didn't want to wake up the poor people who were still in the Church of Bed, right? How unfortunate that not many people in the congregation shared this thought and insisted mornings were the best time, but what can you do. That said, people aren't that spiritual where I lived. Many never gave it much thought. How was I able to use all this in-depth knowledge if people just didn't care? I couldn't get their attention for these things, so when push came to shove, I sucked at it. So I just kept studying the bible. But inquisitive minds are prone to fall into the trap of good information...  -  ** *Part 3: Apolegetics Phase, or Go Bibleboy!* **  I would often talk to other Jehovah's Witnesses about their experiences. Many said they would often feel blessed that they were in the religion that was so clearly directed by God's Holy Spirit. I never did and that raised some questions. Why did spreading the Truth¬Æ never made me feel happy? Was it just me doing something wrong? Why couldn't I spread the good news to people?  So I turned to the internet, where my geekdom would be welcomed and my utter lack of charisma hidden. I subscribed to forums such as CARM (which is the ultimate repository of Christian insanity - you should see it, they've got a secular concentration camp with stickies that say homosexuals are spreading disease. It's amazing.) as well as some other forums in order to spread my faith and defend it from people who spread misinformation about it. Despite the warnings given by the elders (congregational leaders) not to go to these sites, I started participating in discussions with Christians and atheists alike. I needed to know what they thought. How else would I be able to defend my faith while simultaneously decide how to convert them? Know thine enemy and all that.  I identified as a Witness. Immediately Christians hurled abuse at me, calling me a cultist. I ignored them. These people were obviously mentally deficient and could not argue their way out of a wet paper bag. This strengthened my faith; clearly all the stupid people are out there, and all the smart people were Witnesses! But then, there were the atheists. Usually respectful people, who read what I had to say and calmly brought up evidence for their position. Whenever a theist would stop by to proseletyze, they calmly yet firmly refuted the arguments presented. The bible was proven wrong in places. All I could do is look it up on the CD-ROM with Watchtower publications and get a half-assed apologetic explanation. I found the contrast quaint. On the one hand we have the close minded, militant believers, and on the other hand the intelligent, intellectual and thoughtful atheists. It puzzled me; the difference was quite clear.  But I marched on despite this. I was the voice of reason among the insane theists. I fired up my Watchtower Library on CD-ROM, read an article from the CD and put it in my own words. That way I would understand the point made instead of degrading into cheap copypasting. Then I would wait for the answer. And answers I got. This wasn't how I imagined it. I thought atheists would tell me I had a good point. I thought I could triumphantly declare myself the winner of a discussion about the existence of God and the veracity of the Bible! Instead, they poked many, many holes in my arguments. I got scared.

Scientists in Utah have identified a quaking aspen as the biggest living organism on Earth, weighing 6,600 tons! You've seen aspens before ‚Äî slender trees with leaves that flutter in the slightest breeze, but what makes this one so big?  If you were to go and have a look at it yourself, you'd probably be fooled. It looks like a grove of aspens covering 200 acres. But, they're all part of the same tree.  Scientists took samples from all the aspens in this forest and found that they're all clones - genetically identical. And they're all connected to a single parent tree. New sprouts called suckers grow from the roots of the parent aspen. The suckers are protected by the grove, and the young trees can get their nutrients from the parent's roots until their own are well established.  This may be why quaking aspen is the most widely distributed tree in North America. And aspen root systems can remain dormant for centuries, until the right conditions exist for the suckers to produce the young trees stems, called ramets (there's a new Scrabble¬Æ word for you).  And to top it off, by checking out fossilized aspens, scientists have determined that some of these aspen clones may be more than a million years old.

t5_6,ultrawox,1300838204,"Folks should realize that ""race"" is something people long ago made up to explain why slavery could exist in the land of equality, but people got so used to this bullshit that it caused real effects on society.  See the PBS documentary [""Race: The Power of an Illusion.""](http://www.pbs.org/race/000_General/000_00-Home.htm)  Here are 10 quick factoids about race, from the [PBS site:](http://www.pbs.org/race/000_About/002_01_a-godeeper.htm)    ""TEN THINGS EVERYONE SHOULD KNOW ABOUT RACE""  Our eyes tell us that people look different. No one has trouble distinguishing a Czech from a Chinese, but what do those differences mean? Are they biological? Has race always been with us? How does race affect people today?  There's less - and more - to race than meets the eye:  1. Race is a modern idea. Ancient societies, like the Greeks, did not divide people according to physical distinctions, but according to religion, status, class, even language. The English language didn't even have the word 'race' until it turns up in a 1508 poem by William Dunbar referring to a line of kings.  2. Race has no genetic basis. Not one characteristic, trait or even gene distinguishes all the members of one so-called race from all the members of another so-called race.  3. Human subspecies don't exist. Unlike many animals, modern humans simply haven't been around long enough or isolated enough to evolve into separate subspecies or races. Despite surface appearances, we are one of the most genetically similar of all species.  4. Skin color really is only skin deep. Most traits are inherited independently from one another. The genes influencing skin color have nothing to do with the genes influencing hair form, eye shape, blood type, musical talent, athletic ability or forms of intelligence. Knowing someone's skin color doesn't necessarily tell you anything else about him or her.  5. Most variation is within, not between, ""races."" Of the small amount of total human variation, 85% exists within any local population, be they Italians, Kurds, Koreans or Cherokees. About 94% can be found within any continent. That means two random Koreans may be as genetically different as a Korean and an Italian.  6. Slavery predates race. Throughout much of human history, societies have enslaved others, often as a result of conquest or war, even debt, but not because of physical characteristics or a belief in natural inferiority. Due to a unique set of historical circumstances, ours was the first slave system where all the slaves shared similar physical characteristics.  7. Race and freedom evolved together. The U.S. was founded on the radical new principle that ""All men are created equal."" But our early economy was based largely on slavery. How could this anomaly be rationalized? The new idea of race helped explain why some people could be denied the rights and freedoms that others took for granted.  8. Race justified social inequalities as natural. As the race idea evolved, white superiority became ""common sense"" in America. It justified not only slavery but also the extermination of Indians, exclusion of Asian immigrants, and the taking of Mexican lands by a nation that professed a belief in democracy. Racial practices were institutionalized within American government, laws, and society.  9. Race isn't biological, but racism is still real. Race is a powerful social idea that gives people different access to opportunities and resources. Our government and social institutions have created advantages that disproportionately channel wealth, power, and resources to white people. This affects everyone, whether we are aware of it or not.  10. Colorblindness will not end racism. Pretending race doesn't exist is not the same as creating equality. Race is more than stereotypes and individual prejudice. To combat racism, we need to identify and remedy social policies and institutional practices that advantage some groups at the expense of others. 	    ¬© 2003 California Newsreel.

t5_2qh6c,palehorse864,1300955831,"Ahh, I see what you're saying.  I think part of the issue, at least for Christians is that our central tenets are that Christ is the center of our salvation. He's referred to as the keystone (The central stone in an archway that supports everything and keeps the whole thing from collapsing).    The centrality of Christian faith is that man has sinned and Christ the Son of God/God himself paid the penalty for our sins on the cross to save us. If we're going to share or tell anyone about our faith at all, we have to cover or at least imply some things.  The fact that he paid for our sins/saved us is the central point of being a Christian. You're someone who Christ has paid for and saved. If we're saved though, that naturally means that we needed saving in the first place. He wouldn't be saving us if we all didn't need saving in the first place. Keep in mind, I'm giving a cliff notes version here that sticks just to certain ideas.    New American Standard Bible (¬©1995) ""I do not nullify the grace of God, for if righteousness comes through the Law, then Christ died needlessly. (Galatians 2:21).   Christ's sacrifice was necessary because we needed saving and no other method was sufficient, not even attempts at obedience to God's law.  Salvation could only come through Christ.  About the issue of saying our faith is the only one, one issue is that pretty much everyone thinks their faith or unfaith or whatever is the right one mainly because if you didn't think it was the right one, you would go pick another that you did think was right.  There are exceptions, people who don't believe but go through the motions for social reasons, but if you truly believe in something, you believe because you think it's more right than other views.    For a Christian, another central tenet of our Faith is that Christ is the only way, and we largely believe this because the gospels indicate that he said as much.   New American Standard Bible (¬©1995) Jesus said to him, ""I am the way, and the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father but through Me.  That's Christ saying he's the only way, so it is certainly central to our belief that he is.    If you have to some up the Christian faith though, a lot of people use John 3:16 as a sort of twitter length summary of our faith.    John 3:16 For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.   The idea that Christ died to give us eternal life, and his being the only way to be saved is pretty much the central idea of Christianity.  If you leave any part of that out, you're not really sharing Christianity all that well. You can share lots of points about Christianity, the story of Jesus' birth, the story of his Crucifixion, his resurrection, some stories about hsi disciples, etc. but if it's missing the reason for it all, it can be a hollow story and you aren't really sharing your belief or telling someone it.  I don't think a Christian can truly share Christianity without covering forgiveness through Christ and his being the only way.  Trying to go about it that way might be akin to promising to feed somebody but only giving them an empty lunch box. The idea is there, but the whole point is missing.  I would also suggest that you read the versus surrounding John 3:16, they will explain a lot about why we believe that people are condemned without Christ.  John 3:16 implies that condemnation by saying ""not perish"" which means that those who don't gain eternal life in that way will perish, but the surrounding versus make it much clearer. http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john%203:14-21&amp;version=NIV  That establishes the centrality of these issues to the Christian faith I think, and the need to share them to be sharing Christianity, but I think the question of why Christians need to share may also be a question some have.  Why don't we believe in this centrality and keep it to ourselves, or discuss it with like minded believers?  For one, it would be terrible to believe in this condemnation, and to know  (I know some would say we don't ""know"" but going back to the idea of everyone following a particular belief because they think it's the right one, the Christian at least ""knows"" in their own mind) the way out of condemnation and not try to tell people. It might be like seeing someone walking onto a faulty staircase or blindly toward an open elevator shaft and not telling them there's a problem. They may tell you off for saying it and continue on, but at least tell them and give them a chance to avoid it. We believe in salvation and condemnation, so we believe that to not tell someone is detrimental to that person.  We can save their bodies, give them food, medicine, etc. but doing so without telling them how to protect their eternity means they are still in grave danger.  The other reason, apart from just our concern for those in danger (If you saw someone in physical danger, wouldn't you say something to warn them?) is that after the resurrection, Jesus set down what is known as the ""great commission"" to his disciples. New International Version Matthew 28:18-20  18 Then Jesus came to them and said, ‚ÄúAll authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. 19 Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, 20 and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.‚Äù  This is what he told his disciples to do and why we share with our neighbors, our families, and other nations and cultures as well. It's a command he gave us to do so.   I hope the idea of the great commission is enlightening, and helps you understand why Christians do what they do in many instances.  Our belief, our religion isn't just going to church and such. A big part is actively reaching out to others and sharing our faith, telling what we believe and informing people about Christ.  They don't have to accept it, we leave that up to them, and they can walk away and say they don't want to hear, but it is a big part of the Christian life to share your testimony with others.    Sharing is a part of our faith, so telling a Christian to not tell others about Jesus, salvation, the need for him to save people from condemnation, etc. is essentially (though that may not be the intent) like telling that Christian ""stop practicing your religion"" or ""quit practicing your religion now"". I know many don't intend for it to come off that way, but a key point in Christianity is to share your beliefs and not leave people in the dark. To fully practice Christianity, we have to share the things above, and to suggest  not sharing or watering down our faith is to suggest that we should just stop practicing our religion. Now, personally, I believe we can be saved and be a Christian before we've done any of this, I'm just saying that the actual practice requires this.  As in my last message, I want to say you have been very respectful in this whole line of questioning and I fear my words in this reply may have come off as a bit direct and harsh sounding in places.

t5_2rch1,DeusModus,1301174154,"This is wonderful news! Congratulations for your recent inner-discovery.  The greatest thing that can happen to a marriage, is the longing that comes for another that's outside of the marital bond. By having your heart reserved for another, only strengthens your bond with your spouse-to-be. Cherish this love. It will not only make you a better husband, but it will also ensure that when things don't bode well for you and your wife, you'll always have your best man watching your back.   Your wife will also come to appreciate this. Even though you may never tell her of your longing feelings towards your best man, she'll know deep in her heart, that nobody can tickle your prostate like he can - which, will also serve as a vital source of your longevity. Your wife may not be able to feel those lumps, but your buddy-in-waiting certainly will, and what better means to check your rectal wellness than with the cheapest, and most efficient probing of them all?  She may resent this unspoken love. It may even make her cry...but deep in her heart, she knows that it's for the better, and you wouldn't be the honest man that you are today if you didn't have an outlet for your unspoken urges. She will come to respect it, and even embrace it - because even lesbians know that plastic will always pale in comparison to the real thing.  ~*‚ô• God Bless ‚ô•*~",‚ô•

t5_2qh1q,dhatura,1301232871,"Here is Chomsky on that question.  ""It's difficult to assess blame for historical disasters. It's somewhat like trying to assess blame for the health of a starving and diseased person. There are lots of different factors. Let's say the person was tortured-that certainly had an effect. But maybe when the torture was over, that person ate the wrong diet, lived a dissolute life and died from the combined effects. That's the kind of thing we're talking about. There's no doubt that imperial rule was a disaster. Take India. When the British first moved into Bengal, it was one of the richest places in the world. The first British merchant warriors described it as a paradise. That area is now Bangladesh and Calcutta‚Äîthe very symbols of despair and hopelessness.  There were rich agricultural areas producing unusually fine cotton. They also had advanced manufacturing, by the standards of the day. For example, an Indian firm built one of the flagships for an English admiral during the Napoleonic Wars. It wasn't built in British factories-it was the Indians' own manufacture.  You can read about what happened in Adam Smith, who was writing over two hundred years ago. He deplored the deprivations that the British were carrying out in Bengal. As he puts it, they first destroyed the agricultural economy and then turned ""dearth into a famine."" One way they did this was by taking the agricultural lands and turning them into poppy production (since opium was the only thing Britain could sell to China). Then there was mass starvation in Bengal.  The British also tried to destroy the existing manufacturing system in the parts of India they controlled. Starting from about 1700, Britain imposed harsh tariff regulations to prevent Indian manufacturers from competing with British textiles. They had to undercut and destroy Indian textiles because India had a comparative advantage. They were using better cotton and their manufacturing system was in many respects comparable to, if not better than, the British system. The British succeeded. India deindustrialized, it ruralized. As the industrial revolution spread in England, India was turning into a poor, ruralized and agrarian country.  It wasn't until 1846, when their competitors had been destroyed and they were way ahead, that Britain suddenly discovered the merits of free trade. Read the British liberal historians, the big advocates of free trade‚Äîthey were very well aware of it. Right through that period they say: ""Look, what we're doing to India isn't pretty, but there's no other way for the mills of Manchester to survive. We have to destroy the competition.""  And it continues. We can pursue this case by case through India. In 1944, Nehru wrote an interesting book [The Discovery of India] from a British prison. He pointed out that if you trace British influence and control in each region of India, and then compare that with the level of poverty in the region, they correlate. The longer the British have been in a region, the poorer it is. The worst, of course, was Bengal‚Äînow Bangladesh. That's where the British were first.  You can't trace these same things in Canada and North America, because there they just decimated the population. It's not only the current ""politically correct"" commentators that describe this‚Äîyou can go right back to the founding fathers. ¬© 2000 ESubjects Inc. All rights reserved. 1 The first secretary of defense, General Henry Knox, said that what we're doing to the native population is worse than what the conquistadors did in Peru and Mexico. He said future historians will look at the ""destruction"" of these people‚Äîwhat would nowadays be called genocide‚Äîand paint the acts with ""sable colors"" [in other words, darkly].  This was known all the way through. Long after John Quincy Adams, the intellectual father of Manifest Destiny, left power, he became an opponent of both slavery and the policy toward the Indians. He said he'd been involved‚Äîalong with the rest of them‚Äîin a crime of ""extermination"" of such enormity that surely God would punish them for these ""heinous sins.""  After the West had robbed the colonies‚Äîand they did, no question about that, and there's also no question that it contributed to their own development‚Äîthey changed over to so-called ‚Äúneocolonial"" relationships, which means domination without direct administration. After that it was generally a further disaster.  [source - PDF](http://www.esubjects.com/curric/general/world_history/unit_one/pdf/chomsky_prosperousfew.pdf)",¬©

The opinion noted that hot coffee (179 ¬∞F (82 ¬∞C) in this case) is not ""unreasonably dangerous."" The smell (and therefore the taste) of coffee depends heavily on the oils containing aromatic compounds that are dissolved out of the beans during the brewing process. Brewing temperature should be close to 200 ¬∞F [93 ¬∞C] to dissolve them effectively, but without causing the premature breakdown of these delicate molecules. Coffee smells and tastes best when these aromatic compounds evaporate from the surface of the coffee as it is being drunk. Compounds vital to flavor have boiling points in the range of 150‚Äì160 ¬∞F [66‚Äì71 ¬∞C], and the beverage therefore tastes best when it is this hot and the aromatics vaporize as it is being drunk. For coffee to be 150 ¬∞F when imbibed, it must be hotter in the pot. Pouring a liquid increases its surface area and cools it; more heat is lost by contact with the cooler container; if the consumer adds cream and sugar (plus a metal spoon to stir them) the liquid's temperature falls again. If the consumer carries the container out for later consumption, the beverage cools still further.[27]",¬©

For as they are heretics, they cannot be true Christians, because it is not from Christ that they get that which they pursue of their own mere choice, and from the pursuit incur and admit the name of heretics.

t5_2qh2p,Denny_Craine,1301375724,"I studied Buddhism and considered myself a Buddhist in my early teens after I had already decided I wasn't a Christian and had shopped around various religions. I think Buddhism is largely harmless, and many of the teachings of Siddhartha Gautama and the Zen schools are fantastic (don't believe anything, no matter who says it or where you read it, unless it makes since to your critical thinking), however at it's core Buddhism is still an ascetic religion that preaches and encourages abstinence in pretty much anything fun. I think asceticism is for the most part, unhealthy and immoral to teach.   Ultimately I think buddhism is seen as good and friendly by pretty much everyone because buddhism is characterized by a pretty fundamental belief in humanism. But in the end it's still a religion based on rather absurd claims (desire is the root of all suffering), unnecessary for the good parts (humanism) to be practiced, and is not immune to being used to justify atrocities (the Japanese empire, the ongoing violence in Sri Lanka fueled by a belief that Sri Lanka rightly belongs to the Buddhist majority).

This morning they sent me an email agreeing to give me 250$. All in all, 250$ isn't that bad considering I had no plans of making money off of the picture in the first place until they stole it.

I honestly don't understand how anyone could even consider doing that to another person, oh my god. I'm really glad you're managing to get over her though. You deserve better!  The PCOS is such a bitch. Are you on any medication for it? I was on birth control for a while then my doctor stopped prescribing it... it didn't really help with the weight (which is what they were focussing on) but I think it helped with hair growth and my skin, except she couldn't/didn't want to see it so I'm not on anything now. :( I really should register with a doctor here and see what they say but I haven't been sick so never really bothered. I'll have to make the effort to do it after Easter.  I'm also going to call up the counselling service once I'm back from Easter holidays. Thanks for the suggestions on what to talk/ask about - one of the reasons I've been putting it off is because I have a lot of trouble articulating how I'm feeling even if I can pinpoint the cause. When I went last time I felt triggered by a certain event and I feel that was kind of all they wanted to talk about even though there were underlying issues, but when I go next I'll make a list of talking points so I can concentrate on what's important. It did help, though. I resolved to be a lot more outgoing and talk to people more, and I do, and I have a lot more friends now but they're kind of more 'good acquaintances'. I would hang out with them while at uni, but wouldn't ask them to do anything spontaneous or go out for a meal or watch a film with them or anything. It's nice knowing a lot more people though and I think I would be feeling a lot worse if I hadn't made that effort. I'm just not very good at getting closer to people than that.  But it's good to hear a success story, thank you for sharing. Good luck with your own journey! ‚ô•",‚ô•
