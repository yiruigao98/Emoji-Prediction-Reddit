So we went out on the back-side porch, myself and the two girls smoked but the friend I came with didn't(even though he smoked all the time back then, which made no sense to me. but then again he was a douche and liked being the sober one to take advantage of whoever wasn't).

t5_2qm4e,visutton,1320215321,"Chapter 5, Venusian at Heart by Victoria Sutton © 2011  	Georgian was always right there in her laboratory, right when she didn’t need him.  She was in the middle of a gene isolation experiment, and couldn’t be interrupted.  She needed to get this finished in time to give the human subjects the gene therapy treatment, so that she could time their ordered termination, for a full moon.  That way, they could have some light on their way to the Everglades.  Janis thought how lucky she was that no one had perfected the ability to read thoughts, or she would be headed for the death penalty.   That’s exactly what crossed her mind when Georgian entered her laboratory.  He was much too interested, and should not be in her laboratory.  He had something up his sleeve.  She could tell by the look on his face. “Janis,” Georgian called her name and she had to look up from her work. “Oh hi, Georgian,” Janis said casually and continued to work. 	“I am bringing the investigators to talk to you about the human subject escape,” Georgian said with stern seriousness, “and they want to talk to you about where the escape route could be.  I told them that you knew this laboratory and the human subject pod better than anyone else.” 	“Sure, I am happy to talk to them,” Janis said, having done this several times before for each of her carefully orchestrated escapes.  She had always thrown them off track enough that they never came close to discovering her escape route. 	“They have some idea that you may be their insider suspect who is planning the escape, but I told them that was nonsense.  You were up for the promotion to head the gene design exploration project, and you had much better things to do with your time.” 	Janis laughed a nervous laugh, try as she would not to sound so nervous. 	“Exactly.  I am quite excited about the possibility of heading the Gene Design Exploration project,” Janis managed to get out a sentence that didn’t sound nervous or flustered.  She needed to sound perfectly confident.  She didn’t need to add to any suspicion he might have.  	“Well, just a heads up that you can expect them any time, and I know you will take care of their concerns,” Georgian sounded satisfied.  He turned to go as he finished his sentence like he usually did.  Then he turned back around at the doorway, which he usually did not do. 	“Oh, and one more thing.  Make sure that Ali has everything she needs to do her work,” Georgian added. 	He really didn’t need to add that, Janis thought, but she nodded dutifully toward Georgian as he continued out of her doorway and down the hall. As promised, the investigators show up at Janis’s laboratory within the hour.  She begins to shut down her experiment because she knows this will take at least an hour and blow the rest of her productive day in the laboratory.   “Janis69?”  the investigator asked, and when Janis replied in the affirmative, sticking her tongue out for the optical DNA scan to confirm her identity, scanning her DNA that sat ready for the viewing on her tongue.  Then in a millisecond it linked to her employment identification and position  in Progenitor. “Research scientist, Director of the Gene Laboratory,” it read. And your creds?” Janis replied in return, knowing that she needed to affirm their identity as well.  They complied by showing her their pocket reader scans of their DNA linked to their position in Progenitor.    “Janis, we are here to just ask you a few questions, and I know that you have done this before, so we have only a couple of things to ask,” the guy with a scar over his eyebrow responded. “How much laboratory space do you have here?” Janis thought that an odd question for an criminal investigator but responded, “20,000 square feet.” “And how many portable pods do you have with your work in storage?”  Again, Janis thought this an odd question, and responded, “twenty-seven.” “Very good,” the investigator looked satisfied, “we can effect your transfer immediately and transfer your pods to the laboratory in the East quad while we continue the investigation.” Janis heart sank.  They couldn’t move her from her laboratory!  That was her area, and they had no right to take her space and just haul her into another quad!  And the human subjects.  She would not be able to carry out her next escape plan, and they would soon learn that the one person who was no longer here was responsible when no other escapes occurred!  That must be their plan. “I find this highly irregular,” Janis said without emotion, “I need to stay in my space.  I have a limited amount of time, and we are in the middle of accelerating our project to finish with our human subjects.” “That has all been taken care of.  You can continue with your research, but your laboratory will be under the supervision of …. Let’s see here, yes, Ali51 will be the temporary laboratory director while you are in your temporary space,” the scar on his forehead twitched as he spoke. ",2,1,0,0,1,0,©

t5_2qm4e,visutton,1320216041,"continued . . . Chapter 5, Venusian at Heart by Victoria Sutton© 2011  “It is only a temporary arrangement to clear you of any suspicion,” the second investigator added, who up until this point had been decidedly quiet. “You can gather your things and you have two hours, before the movers will transport you to the East quad,” the first investigator added, “and please touch the pad to signify that you understand what we are doing and that this is not an admission of guilt.” “Sure,” Janis replied trying not to show the panic that was cursing through her body at this very moment.  She dearly hoped that no one noticed her deep fear that she would be discovered.  But what is worse, the human subjects will be ordered to termination and she would be absolutely powerless to help them. “Good day,” they hardly smiled and Janis thought it just as well, relieving her of the obligation to smile back. While Janis was reeling from the new chaos that was her life, now Georgian walked into her doorway.  That man always managed to appear at the most unfortunate times. “Janis, I am sorry we have to move you,” Georgian said, and he hardly knew how to say the words ‘I am sorry’ so Janis was a bit worried. “Are you crazy making Ali the head of this lab?” Janis said to Georgian, “you know she is a security risk and has a terminator gene!” “Yes, I know Janis, that is what you say, but we need to clear your name.  The rumors that you are the insider responsible for the escapes are creating a morale problem, and it is also going to affect my ability to promote you to the laboratory director position that you want.” “Are you kidding me?” Janis was incredulous, “over some silly rumors?” “Fewer rumors have sunk more than one ship, Janis,” Georgian remarked in his usual cold way, then added, “we also believe that there is a corporate spy that may have infiltrated Progenitor, and we want to isolate them.  We have found irregularities in the entries and searches in the bioinformatics databases.” Janis is immediately suspicious of Ali but holds back from pointing this out to Georgian.  Janis thought surely he hadn’t been completely blinded by her beauty, too?   “How long is this temporary transfer?” Janis wanted a direct answer. “I don’t know, but probably for maybe three weeks,” Georgian said knowing more than he was telling her. “That is too long!  This is going to slow down my research and the replication we need for the gene to get the conception insertion rate higher, and you know this!” Janis knew she was beginning to sound exasperated.  “It‘s a deal that is closed, Janis.  I’ll check in with you in the East quad later today,” Georgian said, as he turned and disappeared quickly out of her doorway.  There was no more to be said. Janis had two hours, and she needed to get to find the gene that Ali was searching, the one that she was replicating that had origins in Venus bacteria.  This just doesn’t make sense, and she would not dare tell Georgian because then they would all just dismiss her and conclude that she was jealous of Ali. She had to find real proof. Janis went to the classified database with the access code for her laboratory which Ali had already entered.  As she watched the codes spinning like an old slot machine on her wallscreen, she watched for the gene’s code to appear.  When the spinning stopped, she hit the jackpot.  There was the gene and the information she wanted to search. “Hi Janis!” Magellan lumbered into the laboratory, like he was floating on a cloud.  Janis thought he was the last thing she needed just now. “Magellan, I don’t have time to hear about your lunch with Ali, right now, I have two hours before I am being transferred to the East quad,” Janis talked without removing her gaze from the wallscreen. “What?

It's certainly not going to convince any non-MRAs who are not already biased against feminists.  &gt;That's not what happened, this is the group that write VAWA, NOW were the main lobbyists.  &gt;Legal Momentum: Legal Momentum Homepage www.legalmomentum.org/ 25 Oct 2011 – Legal Momentum - Advancing Women's Rights ... ©2009 Legal Momentum | Founded as NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund in 1970 ...

Is that saying that Legal Momentum = ""NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund""?  Or only in 1970?  Because I thought VAWA was passed in 1994?  So far you have a couple random lines that suggest that a feminist organization called Legal Momentum was funded as a subdivision of NOW in 1970.  &gt;1. An agreement to perform together an illegal, wrongful, or subversive act. 2. A group of conspirators.  Where did you get this definition?  Why do you feel it is more valid than the one I used?  Secrecy is a generally accepted element of conspiracies.  Pick a conspiracy-- JFK, Jimmy Hoffa, 9/11, going to the moon-- they were all alleged to have been planned and carried out secretly.  If it's public, it's just a group effort.

Nambudripad's Allergy Elimination Techniques, also known as NAET®, are a non-invasive, drug free, natural solution to eliminate allergies of all types and intensities using a blend of selective energy balancing, testing and treatment procedures from acupuncture/acupressure, allopathy, chiropractic, nutritional, and kinesiological disciplines of medicine. One allergen is treated at a time. If you are not severely immune deficient, you may need just one treatment to desensitize one allergen. A person with mild to moderate amount of allergies may take about 15-20 office visits to desensitize 15-20 food and environmental allergens. Basic essential nutrients are treated during the first few visits. Chemicals, environmental allergens, vaccinations, immunizations, etc. are treated after completing about ten basic essential nutrients. NAET® can successfully eliminate adverse reactions to egg, milk, peanuts, penicillin, aspirin, mushrooms, shellfish, latex, grass, ragweed, flowers, perfume, animal dander, animal epithelial, make-up, chemicals, cigarette smoke, pathogens, heat, cold, other environmental agents. It may take several office visits to desensitize a severe allergen.NAET® was discovered by Dr. Devi S. Nambudripad in November of 1983. ",487,55,0,0,0,0,®

t5_2qm4e,bdunderscore,1320471392,"It's complicated. We start with really basic components, and use them to build up to more complex components, and eventually we make it to the computer.  First of all, we start with the basic electrical components. Resistors, voltage sources, capacitors, transistors. How to build these things is a bit out of my field; ask someone versed in semiconductor technology for transistors, at least. In any case, transistors in computers act a bit like a switch. You might have a circuit a bit like this:                  C               |              /     B ------|              ↘               \               |               E  B is the 'base'. C is the collector, and E the emitter. The way it works is, if the voltage at B is higher than E, then a current can flow from C to E, thus increasing E's voltage. When combined with other components, we can start building the next step up - logic gates.  Logic gates take one or more digital inputs (ie, we only care if they're high or low, and will amplify the hell out of the signal anyway so all the subtle analog variations will be lost) and produce one or more outputs according to some defined rule. For example, the NOT gate takes one bit of input, inverts the signal (changes high voltage, ie 1, to low, ie, 0, and vice versa). The circuit diagram for a NOT gate looks a bit like [this](http://www.kpsec.freeuk.com/images/trinvert.gif). There are plenty of [other gates as well](http://230nsc1.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Electronic/trangate.html).  Now, at this point we can build what are called sequential logic circuits. By putting lots of gates together, we can essentially build an uber-gate - which takes lots of inputs and makes lots of outputs, according to some rule. You can build circuits to [add numbers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adder_(electronics\)), for example. But there's no state yet - that is, it can't remember anything. If you put the same set of inputs, it'll always make the same set of outputs.  So, at this point, we add in latches (aka flip-flops) and a clock. A latch is simply a set of gates configured to loop back into themselves, which stores one bit of data. One of the most common kinds in use is the [D flip-flop](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flip-flop_(electronics\)#D_flip-flop) - it takes a bit of input, and a 'clock' bit, and has an output. The moment the clock bit _changes_ from 0 to 1, it takes a snapshot of whatever's on the input bit, and presents it at the output.  Usually, you then connect a clock generator (basically something that toggles between 0 and 1 on a fixed schedule) to all your flip-flops - making sure the signal takes the same amount of time to reach each one. At this point you now have a circuit that can hold state. You can loop your sequential logic circuits back on themselves with a flip-flop in between - essentially, then, your sequential logic becomes a circuit that moves the 'state' of the system (held in the flip-flops) ahead one step. After each step, the clock flips over, the new state is saved in the flip-flops, and yet another state is then built up based on this state (and probably some inputs from the outside world).  Typically there'll be even more high level concepts built upon this, as it's impossible to keep everything in your head otherwise. Things like finite state machines, instruction decode ROMs, buses, muxers, etc etc. If you're interested in the details, I encourage you to watch Harry Porter's [excellent presentation on the design of his relay computer](http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~harry/Relay/VideoTutorial/index.html) - it's basically the same except he uses relays for switches instead of transistors, because they make this very satisfying chunka-chunka noise as the machine runs.  As for how memory works, there are a few major data storage methods in use:  * [Dynamic Random Access Memory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_random_access_memory) (DRAM) - the 'RAM' in your computer. Fast and moderately expensive. It works by creating an array of capacitors, each with a single transistor controlling access. Downside: Data only lasts something on the order of a few hundred milliseconds; the RAM controller must 'refresh' the data before then by reading it off, amplifying the signal, and writing it back. Data is therefore lost when power is lost. * [Static RAM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_random-access_memory) - used for CPU cache RAM. Very expensive, but very very very fast. Basically a flip-flop in nature. No need to refresh. Also loses data when the power is cut, but for different reasons. * [Flash RAM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_ram) - used for those USB memory sticks, as well as storing the computer's BIOS and (recently) in solid-state drives. Slower than DRAM, but less expensive per-byte and preserves data on power-off. Uses some [quantum tunneling weirdness](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_ram#Floating-gate_transistor) that I don't fully understand. Major downsides: It's not possible to _fully_ erase a flash RAM cell, and after some number of write-erase cycles, the cell will eventually fail. Additionally, it's usually not possible to erase a single flash bit; instead, a very large block of flash cells are erased all together; this makes efficiently storing data in flash quite complex. * [Memristors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memristor) - supposedly will come to market in 2-3 years. Like flash, it is persistent, but supposedly it'll be able to achieve higher density and/or more write cycles and/or faster access. May have applications in computation circuits as well, possibly replacing transistors for some applications. Only time will tell if it lives up to all the hype. * Magnetic media, such as [hard disk drives](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_disk) - data is encoded as magnetic fields on a spinning disc or tape. Advantages: Very low cost compared to the memory technologies above, and the technology is very well understood. Downsides: Slooooooooooooooooooow. As in 2-3 orders of magnitude slower than everything else.  There are a number of other experimental technologies such as [phase change memory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase-change_memory) and historical technologies such as [delay line memory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delay_line_memory), but I'll leave it to you to explore wikipedia for these :)",29024,366,0,0,1,0,↘

t5_2qhyq,ravia,1320525117,"&gt;As part of a concert series in Paris at the Salle Pleyel and the Cité de la musique, Hélène Grimaud plays once again with the Kammerorchester des Bayerischen Rundfunks. &gt; &gt;In 2008, Hélène Grimaud recorded a highly acclaimed album entirely dedicated to Bach, and most notably his Concerto BWV 1052. “Why does Bach music touches everyone and speaks to everyone?” the pianist wondered, while trying to discover the secret of his music’s universal power. “Bach is the Bible"", she explained in 2008 to a journalist of L’Express, ""I know it since my childhood, when I started playing his works every day, like so many other pianists. Except for Shakespeare, no artist has been able to bring out such deep and intimate emotions like he did. Bach offers something that helps us getting closer to what is true in life, as if his music was the music conscience itself, its reassurance and its promise"". &gt; &gt;Today she performs Bach accompanied by the chamber orchestra of the Bavarian radio. In order to open a dialogue with the Brandenburg concertos' composer, she chose two works for orchestra and piano by the Ukrainian composer Valentin Silvestrov, who presents his own music as metaphorical: music after music. Der Bote (1996) is a simple work for strings and piano; Zwei Dialoguen mit Nachwort (2002) is dedicated to Arvo Pärt. In a second part, the Kammerorchester des Bayerischen Rundfunk will perform the Serenade for strings by Czech composer Antonín Dvořák. &gt; &gt;View Hélène Grimaud's page on the Deutsche Grammophon label. &gt; &gt;Photo : © Mat Hennek / DG &gt; ",65268,14072,0,0,1,1,©

t5_2cneq,sarcastic_smartass,1320628696," Mouth breathing From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia   (Redirected from Mouth breather)  This article needs additional citations for verification. Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (May 2011) Mouth breathing ICD-10	R06.5 ICD-9	784.9 Mouth breathing refers to the state of inhaling and exhaling through the mouth. A healthy individual normally breathes through the nose while resting or doing light exercise, and breathes simultaneously through both the nose and mouth during vigorous aerobic exercise, in order to supply sufficient oxygen. Excessive mouth breathing is problematic because air is not filtered and warmed as much as when inhaled through the nose, as it bypasses the nasal canal and paranasal sinuses, and dries out the mouth. Mouth breathing is often associated with congestion, obstruction, or other abnormalities of the upper respiratory tract. Mouth breathing is a diagnostic sign of adenoiditis especially with persistent rhinorrhea.[citation needed] Comorbidities include asthma, obesity, snoring, halitosis, and obstructive sleep apnea.[citation needed] Mouth breathing in children can be a cause of abnormal facial growth primarily in the upper and lower jaw shape, leading to Long Face Syndrome or other malocclusions[1]. Contents  [hide]  1 Dental effect 2 Social perception 3 See also 4 References [edit]Dental effect  Mouth breathing is considered harmful to the dento-oral complex as it can lead to hypotonicity of the upper lip, hyperactivity of the lower lip, distoclusion, harm to dental growth as well as bone growth, high vault of the palate, xerostomia, and adenoid face[citation needed]. [edit]Social perception  In North America, mouth breathing in public is sometimes considered to be less socially acceptable or attractive than nose breathing, as mouth breathers can appear to have a somewhat ""slack jawed"" look, and mouth breathing can amplify or make more obvious the existence of bad breath. The term 'mouth breather' is used as an insult towards a person with a perceived lack of intelligence or someone with poor social skills.

t5_2qh03,Nienordir,1320636494,"I was quite suprised too when I did the math for the first time, because I didn't expect such a huge gap. Some factors that play into it are the more standardized pc hardware, because going from PCI to AGP, PCIe and several CPU&amp;DDR sockets was quite expensive, but AMD did a really great job with the AM2/2+/3/3+ platform, because you always had a reasonable upgrade path and the compatibility of PCIe generations helped a lot too, then there's the incredibly long console generation, which is 'holding back' gaming with the positive side effect, that even older pc hardware can run many games at 1080p with max settings.    Finally a good pc is so versatile, especially for singles/students. When I moved out I got to keep the old sound system (eventhough I didn't want it), but I never used it, because a PC combined with mp3s is just so much more awesome than a old CD Player. I never bought a crappy TV, because a 23"" HD TFT is more than enough. And since I got a decent (but cheap) capture card to replace a old tv card. I can plug in pretty much anything from old consoles to modern HDMI stuff and run them through my soundcard. No need for another DVD player either. Hell, I even use the PC to tune my guitar and as a makeshift amplifier, because the distortion channel on my crappy amp shorted out. There's pretty much nothing a PC can't do.. ♥    The best thing is once you have a decent system upgrading is a lot cheaper, because you can keep using everything and only replace parts of the core system CPU&amp;MB&amp;RAM / GPU and you're fine. But one of the biggest misconception about console gaming is that people think they run in 1080p and then compare the console to a high end rig that runs BF3 on true 1080p with ultra settings and 16xAA/AF, as if you couldn't run the game on high settings (which still looks a lot better than on the consoles xD). I actually had the opportunity to play Red Dead on my TFT in _'1080p'_ and the textures were so muddy and in the area with many trees I could hardly see the stuff I was looking for, because everything started to blur out badly.    And then there are the glorious steam sales, where you can grab a dozen high quality games of the last years at a price that you almost feel guilty, which puts the PC miles ahead from consoles when it comes to the cost of games..",15492,345,0,0,1,1,♥

t5_2qh6c,passportsling,1320642761,"Christian here and I love the movie (never saw the book)  It brings a new perspective in looking at the humanity of Christ. We in the church mostly too focus in the godliness  of Christ and often forget the human side of him   forget that he who is wholly god was at that time 100% human as well.   Mel Gibson's passion of Christ might portray the physical suffering that he had to endure for our sins. But this movie open my eyes that his sufferings was more than just physical ones. the temptations that he had to endure was even harder to overcome  It gives me new understanding to this verse: For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who has been tempted in every way, just as we are--yet was without sin.  (Hebrew 4:15-niv)  He has been tempted in every way. And the movie shows it beautifully, complete with ""alternate ending"" (or dream, if you read roger Ebert review) showing what will happened to the world if the messiah has fallen to temptation:  meaningless and chaos.  It gives me a new understanding of Jesus last words on the cross as well: 'it is done.' Indeed, not just his mission but also all his sufferings and burdens and temptations, physically and mentally had done.  It was a beautiful movie. Was looking for the book but gave up long time ago. Maybe now ill try to look for the eBook .Thanks for reminding me ☺",190,1,0,0,1,1,☺

t5_2qh6c,pbhj,1320675139,"I don't think that makes sense.  If they paid the cost of eating out as mandated by the restaurant then the server is getting the wage that they have agreed to work for. Meanwhile that tip money when spent on a clean water supply for a village, eye-care, general medical supplies, food generation programs, etc., can make a measurably larger contribution to overall happiness.  One doesn't know the specifics, it could be a tight-wad, it could be that they've donated money to people who would otherwise be living a far-far less manageable lifestyle than the person who served the food.  FWIW I work in service industry (customer facing) for lower than the mandated minimum wage in my country (though it's legal) and have never received a tip as much as 10%.  I don't like the coercive tone or the inference that for some reason Christians *must* pay a server more simply because they're Christians. Yes, they should *want* to be just.   For the OP: you should work to get a proper minimum wage instituted and probably talk to management about how you communicate to customers that they (management) pay you less than minimum wage and that you rely on direct customer paid wages (they don't fit the definition of ""tips"" IMO) to make a living. If you're not communicating that to the customers then it's really your boss that's ripping you off isn't it.  Christianity is about relationship to God. It is not a necessary condition of moving towards a better relationship with God that one be generous. It *is* an expected outcome.  Out of interest, which specific church fellowships do the people mainly represent? You'd have picked that up in banter presumably?

The characters are likable and (somewhat) believable, sure, but their stories all end up the same way: they have some great epiphany on how to live their life because of the Protag's (he has a name, but no one can agree on it) presence in it. The last two scenes in literally every Social Link path (that's essentially what the stories are called for each character you can 'date') are comprised of the NPC telling the Protag exactly where and when their lives had gone so wrong, and then thanking him for showing them the right way to live.  &gt; ""I just didn't want to admit that I was insecure, so I started acting all tough and confident to hide it. But being around you showed me that it's okay to like girly things. Thank you so much, Protagonist! ♥""  That's an exaggeration, of course, but that's what many of the Social Links end up feeling like. You end up getting the impression that the main character is the male twin of Mary Sue. It was also much easier to balance your time and see many of the SL paths to their completion (though finishing them all in one playthrough was extremely difficult and not worth it to most players).  Persona 3 did the Social Links and their stories much, much better. For most of them, the characters in each SL have their own problems that they end up solving on their own. You, the Protagonist, end up befriending them along the way and just sitting back and witnessing their own personal growth. The writing and presentation feels much more natural than P4's script, and the main characters and their stories were kept rightly seperate from what was essentially just a way to expand the gameworld (albeit a nicely-executed one), challenge the player to prioritize their time outside of battle, and assist in creating a more defined combat role for the Protag in-battle. Each SL path is linked to a specific Major Arcanum of the Tarot, the way every Persona -- your summons which define how and how well you can battle -- was; Personae aligned to Arcana whose SL you'd progressed in somewhat gained an extra boost to their starting level when you created them. Personae from a specific Arcanum are balanced to be used in a certain way and at a certain range of levels, and some SL's are encountered later in the game than others; that combined with the extremely slow rate at which your Personae leveled up forced you to continuously create stronger ones by fusing the ones you currently had together as well as choose which Arcana you wanted to progress in over others, which translated into which Personae you had the most proficiency with and what roles the Protag would perform in battle.  **Tl;dr: If you do decide to play either of the latter two Persona games (P1 and the P2 duology don't count because they're so different), start with P3. It's just better.**",557,1,0,0,1,1,♥

But she couldn’t stop thinking about her human subjects and she walked down to the laboratory to see them.   How she wished she could let them go right now, but that would bring the investigation to an unsavory end, and the death penalty would be waiting for her.  This was a prima facia crime, and there would be no trial, just the death penalty.  The Congress had considered it so serious that the uncertainty of a jury could not be risked.  Mistakes might be made with convictions, but it was that serious to the survival of the human race. 	This was the first time that Janis felt completely out of options.  She couldn’t be seen anywhere in this quad or suspicions would soar.   Her hopes of freeing the human subjects were quickly diminishing with each hour, and tomorrow, Ali, the new laboratory director would be giving the order to exterminate them in the afternoon.  It was a blessing indeed, that the human subjects never knew the date or the time of their extermination.  They only knew it would be coming. 	Janis didn’t plan to go on her own to the East quad, she knew she would be escorted, and her escorts had arrived.  As she picked up her wallscreen key, she noticed Ali walking down the hallway toward her, a smile easing across her face.  She was not hiding her pleasure with Janis’s removal and her sudden promotion.  Magellan was not far behind her in the hallway.  Janis couldn’t help but think that Ali was the corporate spy, but from where and why would she be inserting terminator genes?  Or was it simply for retribution because she had mistakenly been inserted with a terminator gene?  Or was it a mistake? 	Janis turned to the information she had discovered about this gene.  Something obscure in the footnote had been nagging at her, and it was this strange property of being triggered by a pheromone, a chemical produced by humans, a natural perfume perceptible only if the right gene happened to be there. 	In her new quarters in exile, Janis began setting up to look at her wallscreen from a comfortable vantage point in the room.   	“Janis, did everything arrive in order?” Georgian appeared as promised.   	“What is it that you are looking at?” Georgian moved into her vantage point to view the wall screen. 	“It’s a world history bioinformatics database.  It describes the use of pheromone triggers for genes.  It looks like it was a technique used in one of the old bioweapons programs last century,” Janis continued to explore the data while Georgian focused on the wallscreen. 	“Let’s take a look at the gene sequence we have been inserting for the last thirty years,” Janis said to Georgian as he looked confused. 	“Look at this gene sequence we have been using since the beginning of the CO2 tolerant gene project, Georgian,” Janice pointed with her chubby hand at the wallscreen.  She wasn’t thinking about her unpolished nails right now. 	“Yes, I see it, and run it through the bioinformatics database,” Georgian said with certainty.  The gene code whirled to a stop like three oranges on a slot machine. 	“There it is.  The gene code is exactly what we have in the bioinformatics database,” Georgian said smugly, “it is the CO2 tolerant gene.” 	“Yes, but it is in a gene sequence, Georgian.  Let’s see what else is in the gene sequence,” Janis said, eyes focused intently on the screen. 	“These are just genes which do nothing, or nothing important,” Georgian said.  We have tested them and run them through the database for thirty years.  Janis, you are really going beyond reason, here.” 	“Wait.  Let’s access the classified bioinformatics database that you gave Ali full and free access to,” Janis smirked a bit. 	“So what, Janis?  I have my reasons for giving her access,” Georgian said, now defensively. 	The gene code whirled again and landed on a match, and just as Janis had expected. 	“It’s a terminator gene,” Janis let the words sink in and watched Georgian’s reaction. 	“My God!  Why did we never discover this before?” Georgian reels from this discovery. 	“It was in our off-limits database, and it was always just in the useless part of the gene sequence, merely a handle bar for the gene we were inserting,” Janis continued, “Now we have a terminator gene in every child conceived in America for the last thirty years.” 	“Look, this is impossible.  If that were true, then we would have people terminating!” 	“It has only been thirty years.  What if the terminator ends in thirty years, like Ali’s claim, or what if it is triggered by something like the old bioweapons plan?” 	“You mean by pheromones?” Georgian asked incredulously. 	“Yes, I mean by pheromones and what if Ali has been coded for the release of the pheromone?  Maybe she could trigger the gene to begin termination with one person she was close to, but so what?”  Janis said. 	“It would have to be dispersed over the earth, and there is nothing that can do that other than a nuclear blast and a pheromone would disappear in the cloud immediately, like alcohol evaporating in the sun,”  Georgian surmised. 	Just then the Progenitor alarm sounded, and alert-optics pierced their exchange.   	Janis and Georgian looked around, and the hallways filled with emergency Progenitor police, each reaching their monitoring stations in seconds. 	“It looks like you don’t need to worry about further rumors,” the investigator with the scar above his eyebrow had appeared behind her quietly emerging from the hallway chaos, “we have had another human subject escape, and this time it is a record number.  We estimate almost 250 on the way to the Everglades.  It’s a full moon, too.  Really bad timing for us.”   	Janis was stunned.  An escape? 	Georgian smiled, “I knew you were innocent all the time, we just had to prove it,” he said nervously, “I told Ali that I knew you were innocent but she kept telling us that she had seen you behaving suspiciously the day of the last escape.”   	Ali.  No surprise.  Janis knew Georgian was just as suspicious of her as the rest of the rumormongers.  But she couldn’t worry about Georgian’s fickleness now, she had to focus on Ali and what she might do to trigger the terminator gene. 	“Where is Ali, anyway?” Georgian asked. 	“I know that she was going with Magellan to hike Mt. Ranier today, after closing,” Janis said, still wondering how the human subjects had escaped. 	“Now that’s bad timing,” Georgian remarked, “Mt. Ranier is rumbling and the entire northeast is under a volcanic ash warning.” 	“What happens to volcanic ash, Georgian?” Janis said rhetorically, “A huge cloud forms and covers most of the earth for the next year,” Janis grabbed her coat and started for the door with Georgian following her.",2,1,0,0,1,0,©

t5_2qh6c,TheFlyingBastard,1320780676,"&gt; So what are you saying Jehovah isnt the source of abject morality? That there is a better source? Or that man could do better?  Well, obviously. Yahweh does not exist. And even if he did, just because he supposedly lives in some kind of heavenly abode above the clouds it doesn't make him right. In fact, I'm going to pose you with a challenge.  *Is something right because Yahweh commands it so, or does Yahweh command it because it's right?*  &gt; How ius your argument different then Korah murmuring against Moses?  Korah was critical. So he should be. Thomas was also critical. So he should be. But no, ""blessed are those who have believed without having seen"". Just take it aaaaall on faith. *That* is how you stay ignorant. *That* is how you stand still - not just as a group, but as a species. Korah's big mistake - in my eyes - was trying to stir up trouble rather than actual discussion. But it certainly does not warrant such an abhorrent punishment.  Yahweh seems to be extraordinarily butthurt with humans questioning the top brass claiming leadership.  &gt; I may have some things I dont agree with but you know what? I'll wait on perfect and then I can ask Jehovah directly. How is leaving the org and turning on Jehovah and the ones he chose going to answer your questions?  Because first of all, Yahweh does not exist. Also, once you get out of this bubble you'll find a world that holds more answers than any Watchtower book can provide you. And then you'll see that they're full of it. I mean, like, everything. From science to reasoning, it's horribly flawed to the point where I am convinced that in some places they are doing it on purpose. All of this in defense of a flawed book.  &gt; Who will learn more about the world those that have a short time left or those that are granted the gift of everlasting life? Dude I like science and all the other things and plan to pursuit them but for now i'll wait on Jehovah.  You should probably pursue science *before* you die. Nobody will live forever. It's a fairy tale. Yahweh does not exist, remember?  &gt; Isnt teaching people the bible keys to happiness and everlasting life a greater key to maximizing their happiness?  Nope. The bible has a little bit of good philosophy, but it really doesn't give us anything special that you can't figure out with some common sense. Plus, as mentioned above, it encourages blindly following people.  &gt; the world is on a knifes edge a powder keg because of all the injustice and greed.  It's not nearly as bad as the WTS makes it seem. There's some political tension, but injustice and greed is mostly an issue in countries with a lot of religion. The more secular a society is, the better it actually functions.  &gt; You things these atheist high priest like sam harris , dawkins etc are going to personally tell you they where sorry and wrong on the day of armageddon?  Armageddon does not exist. Are you fear-mongering now?   Second, they are not high priests. I really wish you would stop strawmanning.   Third, sure. They have admitted they are wrong. ""I used to be of the opinion that x, but now I think y because z."" is something that I have heard more than once. But why is this so relevant? Why do they need to apologize? They are not high priests, they are speakers. They do not claim divine inspiration. They do not claim to be right all the time. That's religious leaders. They put their opinion out there with the caveat that it is only their view and that it is alright to disagree.   &gt; How do think Satan feels having you as a pawn? Dude you have the truth that leads to everlasitng life what evolutionist and atheist who are putting their faith in sicnece wish to have and you turned your back on it really?  Satan does not exist. The Truth® that leads to everlasting life is a baloney too. There is not a single shred of evidence that any JW has so far provided for their faith. Perhaps you can be the first one? Perhaps you can provide evidence for say, creation? Or how about just the existence of a god? Any god. Doesn't even have to be your god. Can you do that?  &gt; i'm trying to find out why someone who potentially had it all, could walk away from it. How a person that should have clearly seen satan in the background not chooses to fall in line with satan and his lies.  Well, first, Satan does not exist. Second, if you want to know the answer, perhaps next time you should ask ""Hey, what is your story? Why were you a JW first and now you're not?""  &gt; Dude there are only 2 sides. For Thor or you are automatically on Jörmungandr's side. There are no thousands of other options. For Thor's sovereignty and rule or not. Obviously not.  Fixed that for you.   See how inane that looks when you don't have any evidence to back up your beliefs?  Again, out of the thousands of options, I have merely chosen the one with the least assumptions.  &gt; That is not really knowing much more then christians is it?  You're shifting the goalposts now. Some atheists don't know *much* more, but on average, atheists *do* know more. And that was the matter at hand. It's irrelevant anyway; the believers need to come up with evidence. Can you come up with evidence (1 Peter 3:15)?  &gt; No its not and I cannot for the life of me understand how you can again choose it over knowing the truth about God and Satan and his lies. He is not said to be misleading the entire earth because he isnt, it is because he is.  Satan does not exist. What you call the Truth® is nothing more than a confabulation based on old texts without any evidence to back it up whatsoever.  &gt; Well what would you call a person who held the keys to everlasting life, with perfection in mind and body. Then he turned his back on it to run with a bunch of people who claim they are independent but dont know that they are in fact also being mislead. Really dude I cannot see how you got from here to there. Other then a really bad heart condition. Because no sane person would make that jump.  Perhaps something is wrong with your reasoning then. I'd say you are badly mistaken on the initial assumptions on the situation. For example, nobody holds the keys to everlasting life. Satan does not exist. Yahweh does not exist.  I suggest you read up on your own mythology - and here comes the trick - *outside the confines of the Watchtower Society*. I know it's a huge leap to go from that walled garden of derp to gaining actual knowledge, but if you really do value science as you say you do, you can get over it.  &gt; We end our conversation here.  Ah, is that the way you handle things? First make long, drawn out posts, spouting your stories and claims and then you push the eject button?  Have a spine. Back up your claims with evidence or bite the bullet and admit you have been making some very bad basic assumptions.",109935,3321,0,0,1,1,®

""Metro area median existing-home prices in the third quarter generally were down from a year ago, while sales rose in every state from the third quarter of 2010, according to the latest quarterly report by the National Association of Realtors®.  The median existing single-family home price rose in 39 out of 150 metropolitan statistical areas1 (MSAs) in the third quarter from a year earlier; 111 areas showed price declines. In the second quarter, 41 metro areas had posted annual price gains.  Lawrence Yun, NAR chief economist, said the market is holding fairly even. “Home sales need to recover first – only then can prices stabilize. Existing-home sales are little changed from the second quarter but are notably higher than a year ago,” he said. “The good news is inventory levels have been trending gradually down.”  I hate selective data caching.

t5_2rzgi,Mozai,1320993640,"""enforced""?  Oh good gosh, no.  Rule 0 still applies and will never be obsolete.  I'm not suggesting that GMs should be restricted in their non-combat storytelling, any more than a melee system restricts combat storytelling to a series of  ""step forward, swing sword"" instructions.  Here's an example: a GM with a party of fighters, and not a single magician, knows that her players want physical melee.  There are rules for physical melee.  She still has the choice of when, where and how, or even to use a magical opponent when it is appropriate to shake up the players.  Since the players explicitly chose their combat roles by their class/career choices, she has cues for what sort of combat-story the players want to see. Now, where would a GM get these cues for what her players want in the social or emotional parts of the game?  Does she make a guess, bring in a caliginous hate-interest for a character and /whoops/ that player is uncomfortable role-playing blackrom .  If a player was uncomfortable with putting their character in physical danger, they'd pick an archer or wizard.  If they're uncomfortable with ♠, there's no cue in the mechanics of a combat-oriented rpg for the DM to know this.  I guess it comes down to what kind of game you want when you are making a SBURB/SGRUB-themed game.  Do you want a combat game?  Weird puzzle shit?  Time shennanigans?  Quadrants of romance?  One could say ""we have a combat system, just make up the rest of the stuff,"" and I would counter ""why is the combat system so special that it gets rules when the other aspects of the game have to be made-up on the spot?""   Would it be upsetting to just make-up the combat skirmishes on-the-spot?  If so, why is that not okay, but playing by ear for the social conflicts *is* okay?  EDIT: I don't think making the social/emotional parts of the game as systematic as the combat part of D&amp;D or DarkHeresy is the answer either (though the idea of a battlemat for blackrom does have it's appeal... or moving minis around a shipping wall...).  I don't want to wrench the game from one extreme (absence) to the other (regimented), just away from the extreme of ""absence; make it up as you go along, hope the players are okay with it.""",14159,2692,0,0,1,1,♠

The tea was made with 1 quart of boiling water poured into a bowl with the following:  2 Cinnamon sticks  3 Cloves (whole)  1/2 Nutmeg (shredded)  1 Star Anise  2 inches fresh Ginger, finely sliced  10 Green Cardamom Pods (cracked/split)  Cover the bowl and let it sit for 20 minutes to steep.  Once this is done, strain and add *half* of the tea water to the keg or bottling bucket, then transfer the beer onto it to ensure good mixing.  Take a sample and see if the spices are appropriate; add a portion of the remaining tea as needed.  Keep in mind, CO2 will enhance spice perception, so it is better to use less than more.  This beer is excellent for the holidays!  The malt flavors are mild and blend well with the spices, such that it is incredibly drinkeable even for family members who normally may not drink much beer.

t5_2qh0u,kerat,1321110332,"&gt;You are still generalizing that everyone in the army kills. This man did tours in Iraq that does not mean he killed anyone.  I already explained the logical contradiction of what you are saying. But since English doesn't seem to be your first language, let me repeat:  ""sharpening the murderer's knife for the purpose does not free one from responsibility. Cooking the murderer's breakfast to ensure he has energy to do more killing does not make him a hero. Again, more simplistic b.s from you.""  He joined an illegal war. He joined an immoral war. I don't care if he spent his time giving other soldiers blowjobs - he's still a criminal and an idiot.  &gt;You are from a different state of mind. You cannot fathom anything like volunteering for service.  Oh yeah of course not. Only True Americans© can understand real sacrifice. HOORAAH! FUCK YEAH! AMERICAAA!  Hey I think I'll apply for citizenship of your country. Then when we're both Americans we can jack each other off! ALRIGHT FUCK YEAH! AMERICAAA! NO ONE IN THE WORLD UNDERSTANDS US YEAH!   &gt;If that isn't honorable, then does it become honorable when you kill someone else far away? &gt;Im going to go off on a limb and say THE NAZIS.  Hahahaha. How old are you man? You have the logical consistency of a sock.  You just told me that fighting for your country is honorable.   Then you told me that joining the army doesn't mean that you kill people.  Then you told me that people who join the army don't necessarily believe what their governments tell them.  And when I ask you about murder, you tell me it's honorable if they were Nazis! Hahahaha! So rich! What about all the Nazis who didn't agree with their governments? What about all the Nazis who joined the army for ""respectable healthcare""?   Again - you only see an ""enemy"". Not human beings. You only empathize with your own kind. To your sick mind all other human beings don't matter, because this guy needed ""good healthcare""  If your country is so fucking pathetic that it can't offer its citizens healthcare unless they go off to murder others, then your country is sick and rotten from inside out.  And you didn't even answer my question. I asked:  **Is it honorable to kill your neighbour if it is to ensure you get ""respectable health benefits"" or to ensure that your kids have a good future?**  And:  **If that isn't honorable, then does it become honorable when you kill someone else far away?**  You answered: The Nazis.  Ok, now forget about the Nazis. What about Afghans? What about Iraqis? What about Yemenis or Somalis that your country is now bombing? Are you admitting that killing them isn't honorable whatsoever? Because to me that sounds like a confession.    &gt;We honor both WWII and IRAQ veterans on this day, not because we agree with the government, not because we condone what is done, but because there is a sense of pride for a fellow countryman who is willing to give up his life for HIS COUNTRY.   This is what you don't understand you underaged nitwit. All those other people ALSO died for their countries. You are honoring someone who voluntarily went to kill others for some idiotic childish concept like nationalism, and because someone in the government told him to do it. That is fucking pathetic.   &gt;Unfortunately that also may involve being deployed into a country he is not willing to invade.    Oh yes, ""unfortunately"". Unfortunate for almost a million dead Iraqis. What an elitist sick fuck you are.    &gt;If he disagrees? Dis-honorable discharge, no job, eventual homelessness.   That's because your country is fucking pathetic. No human being should be forced to go off to kill others in fear of joblessness or homelessness. You've become a drone. A simpleton.

Rousseau is to blame for starting it, really: ""private property is the root of all evil! we need to, like, reject modern society and get back to a holistic wholeness with nature and reject materialism and smile on your brother everybody, try to love one another right now.""   it's a *coercive* movement, with a seed of totalitarianism: about 70 thousand protesters have the chutzpa to call themselves ""the 99%"". your reply proves it: WE NEED A NEW SOCIETY! huh, we do? What about those of us who think things are mostly okay in America? We're obviously blind stooges of the ruling class, so our objections can be dismissed by those of you who have access to The Truth®. This is reminiscent of the Bolsheviks calling themselves the ""majority"" who spoke for the working class in fact, they were a small minority of wealthy intellectuals in the Russian political system who resorted to violence and mass terror when the majority rejected their plan for ""bettering society.""  but when Rousseauist fantasy clashes with ugly reality, as it always does, the Rousseauists react with violence and then nihilism.  OWS has burned through this cycle in only a few months. if it's typical of other leftist movements, it's about time for a few bombings or assassinations in the name of the revolution, after which the bulk of supporters will become disillusioned and fall away from the movement.

t5_2qm4e,Copterwaffle,1321137040,"There is a ton of peer-reviewed, scientific research on yoga. Here's an abstract form an article in the Mt. Sinai Journal of Medicine (2010):       Mechanisms underlying the modulating effects of yogic cognitive-behavioral practices (eg, meditation, yoga  asanas, pranayama breathing, caloric restriction) on human physiology can be classified into 4 transduction pathways: humoral factors, nervous system activity, cell trafficking, and bioelectromagnetism. Here we give examples of these transduction pathways and how, through them, yogic practices might optimize health, delay aging, and ameliorate chronic illness and stress from disability. We also recognize that most studies of these mechanisms remain embedded in a reductionist paradigm, investigating small numbers of elements of only 1 or 2 pathways. Moreover, often, subjects are not long-term practitioners, but recently trained. The models generated from such data are, in turn, often limited, top-down, without the explanatory power to describe beneficial effects of long-term practice or to provide foundations for comparing one practice to another. More flexible and useful models require a systems-biology approach to gathering and analysis of data. Such a paradigm is needed to fully appreciate the deeper mechanisms underlying the ability of yogic practice to optimize health, delay aging, and speed efficient recovery from injury or disease. In this regard, 3 different, not necessarily competing, hypotheses are presented to guide design of future investigations, namely, that yogic practices may: (1) promote restoration of physiologic setpoints to normal after derangements secondary to disease or injury, (2) promote homeostatic negative feedback loops over nonhomeostatic positive feedback loops in molecular and cellular interactions, and (3) quench abnormal 'noise' in cellular and molecular signaling networks arising from environmental or internal stresses.

t5_2qh0u,x3knet,1321155071,"&gt;An unexpected side-effect of the 2010 flooding in parts of Sindh, Pakistan, was that millions of spiders climbed up into the trees to escape the rising flood waters; because of the scale of the flooding and the fact that the water took so long to recede, many trees became cocooned in spiders webs. People in the area had never seen this phenomenon before, but they also reported that there were less mosquitos than they would have expected, given the amount of standing water that was left. Not being bitten by mosquitoes was one small blessing for people that had lost everything in the floods.

Best offered was a character witness - we do not accept character witnesses based on we have no idea who it is and to the integrity of what they say.   In General how we handle these types of cases (short and simple).   1- If an account was used to scam, we tag all accounts owned by player as ""scammer.""  This is for the protection of those in the TF2 community, including all of you reading this, and we do have your best interests in mind.   2- If the tagged person claims that a friend, a brother, cousin, or so on did the scam using their account, but it wasn't them, we still usually will not unban.  Why?  Because as admins we are repeatedly lied to by all kinds of scoundrels and should we simply start 'trusting' account owners whose accounts have scammed, without eveidence to support their claim, would be disasterous for all of us in the end.   3- Every person is ultimately responsible for their own account.  Should one choose to ""loan it out,"" then they need to ""man up"" and take responsibility for any wrong doing the person that is controlling it may do.   This case is still ongoing and we as admins are doing what we can to make it fair for everyone, and not make exceptions in some situtaions without evidence that supports an untagging.

There is no reason you can't drive on weed, and some studies have shown an insignificant benefit to your driving.   The latest research by Schaffer in 2010 showed that when adjusted for age none of the data they reviewed from multiple studies showed any significant increase in risk of accident between cannabis smokers and non-smokers.  The other factor is that people who smoke are more cautious.  They over-estimate their level of impairedness (unlike alcohol which has the opposite effect) and are less likely to drive, and more likely to drive more cautiously if they do drive, meaning that the chance of someone driving when they are not capable of it is extremely reduced (unlike alcohol which has the opposite effect).   So, the only thing you are doing by propagating this superstition is to help prop up the fear-mongering that those who would oppose legalization use to justify the continued prohibition.  The lie you believe and tell on their behalf does you no good.   If someone doesn't feel they can drive safely, they shouldn't.  Regardless of any other factors.  Eating food while driving or driving with friends in the car is more dangerous, as far as risk of accident, than smoking cannabis.  ",36749,1359,0,0,1,1,®

Beat in eggs and vanilla until creamy.      3 In medium bowl, mix together flour, baking soda and salt. Gradually blend into creamed mixture.      4 Stir in mini chocolate chips and chopped nuts, if using.      5 Drop from small spoon onto ungreased cookie sheet. Bake 10 to 12 minutes until golden brown.      Makes about 6 dozen cookies.  We've only ever used margarine though, not shortening. You can probably use butter if you want as well. The key here is to make sure that the butter/margarine/fat/whatever is cold when you make the cookies, and make sure that the cookies aren't pressed super flat - they will flatten out as they cook.  They are done when they are browned around the edges.  Also, try not to eat the whole bowl of cookie dough - you won't get any cookies!  The cookie dough should be the consistency of playdough. :)",36949,2663,0,0,0,1,®

This has no minimums or monthly fees if opened with a Schwab One brokerage simultaneously (which has no minimums or monthly fees if opened with the checking). Other than the consumer account schedule for fees, I don't see any reference to those account types on Schwab.com; they may have been retired.  &gt;The Schwab Bank **High Yield Investor Checking**® (“High  Yield Investor Checking”) account is a Schwab Bank  checking account linked to a corresponding Schwab  One® brokerage account (“Schwab One® account”)  maintained at Schwab Brokerage. The linked accounts  allow you to move funds between your High Yield Investor Checking account and your Schwab One®  account. Fees applicable to your Schwab One® account  are listed in the booklet entitled Charles Schwab Pricing  Guide for Individual Investors, which you received when  you opened your Schwab One® account. The **High Yield Investor Checking** account allows you to earn a variable rate of interest on funds you keep on deposit. You also receive a Schwab Bank Visa® Platinum Check  Card and unlimited checkwriting privileges.   &gt;We do not charge any fees for use of any ATM  machine. If you use a machine that is not a Schwab  Bank ATM, you may be charged a fee by the ATM  operator or any network used. This may include a fee  for a balance inquiry even if you do not complete a  withdrawal or other monetary transaction  Alright, now for the important part: &gt;For the following accounts, we offer a rebate on fees assessed by others for ATM cash withdrawals, for the first six transactions, up to a total of $9 per Statement Period  &gt;*(high yield checking not listed)*  &gt;**For the following accounts, we refund fees charged by ATM operators when you use your Schwab Bank  Check Card for ATM cash withdrawals**. The rebate will  appear as a lump-sum credit on the same checking  account periodic statement that includes ATM fees  incurred for that account statement cycle.  &gt;* **High Yield Investor Checking**  I have High Yield Investor Checking and both the text above &amp; calling Schwab yielded the same results. I asked if for my checking account # (1234....)

Actually, it makes no difference which side of the aluminum foil you use—both sides do the same fine job of cooking, freezing and storing food. The difference in appearance between dull and shiny is due to the foil manufacturing process. In the final rolling step, two layers of foil are passed through the rolling mill at the same time. The side coming in contact with the mill's highly polished steel rollers becomes shiny. The other side, not coming in contact with the heavy rollers, comes out with a dull or matte finish. The exception is when using Reynolds Wrap® Release® Non-Stick Aluminum Foil. The non-stick coating is applied during manufacturing to the dull side of the foil. Always place the non-stick (dull) side toward the food.   ",60549,564,0,0,0,1,®

t5_2s5ei,browlands716,1321473007,"Here's my recipe for them (although many other things can be added or substituted, obviously!):  Daiya quesadillas (mozzarella-style and cheddar-style Daiya cheese shreds, brown rice, chopped green bell pepper, and black beans) on whole wheat tortillas with Tofutti sour cream and taco sauce. AWESOME.  One of the first things I ever tried to make with Daiya tapioca-based cheese--These quesadillas are SO good! Such a quick and easy recipe.  What you'll need:  • Small whole wheat tortillas  • Daiya mozzarella-style cheese shreds (or Daiya Pepperjack-style cheese shreds ♥)  • Daiya cheddar-style cheese shreds  • 1-2 cans black beans  • 1-2 cups brown rice  • 1-2 small onions, chopped  • 1-2 cups green bell pepper, chopped (optional)  • Taco Bell Fire Sauce (Sriracha sauce also works great!)  • Tofutti sour cream  Cook rice. Heat up black beans with chopped onions and chopped green peppers (if desired) on medium setting in skillet/pot or in a Crockpot until heated through. Next, lay down one tortilla and spoon desired amount of bean, rice, and onion/pepper mixture into the center, leaving about a 1-inch margin around the outside. Sprinkle cheese along the outer edge of the tortilla (this allows the cheese to melt and seal the edges so the filling doesn't dump out) and over top of the beans and rice. Add an evenly-spread amount of hot sauce (I like to either use 2 to 3 packets of Fire Sauce or a generous amount of Sriracha) and lay another tortilla on top. Press down to secure. Brown both sides of the quesadilla on medium-high heat in skillet until the cheese is fully melted. Done! Quick and easy! I also like to add chopped seitan that has been cooked in taco seasoning sometimes.  Best when served with yummy Tofutti sour cream on the side. ♥  Makes 4-6 servings.",23,2108,0,0,0,1,♥

There is no restriction on long-term use, so you can use ROHTO® DRY EYE RELIEF for as long as you need it. Unpublished studies have been conducted that indicate the drops can have a positive effect on normalising the eyes’ surface and stabilising tear film following one to two months’ treatment. We would therefore recommend that the drops are used as and when required for occasional dry eye symptoms and for one to two months for more long term problems.  It says the exact opposite of what you're saying, basically. although I'll admit that ""unpublished studies"" have absolutely no worth.

There are tons of things you can substitute in and add, so feel free to change whatever ingredients to suit your needs!

Line baking dish with one of the pastry crusts and poke holes in it, baking it for 10 minutes.  Then, fry up the seitan until it's good and browned and set aside in a bowl.  In a large skillet in a small amount of vegetable oil, soften the potatoes, carrots, and onion for a few minutes on medium-high heat.  Add seitan to the pan.  Next, add vegetable broth and spices.  Stir well, cooking for a few minutes before adding vegetables of your choice (corn, peas, celery, green beans, chopped spinach, etc.).  Add some corn starch to thicken up the broth, and once it gets to desired filling consistency, pour into baking dish and cover with the other pastry crust, again poking holes in it.  Seal the edges, pressing with a fork.  Bake for 45 minutes, or until crust is golden brown.",23,2108,0,0,0,1,♥

t5_2qh33,rampant_elephant,1321646739,"So, the company asks some politicians whether they can use a marketing phrase; the politicians check with some scientists and they say:  &gt; Following an application from Prof. Dr. Moritz Hagenmeyer and Prof. Dr. Andreas Hahn, submitted pursuant to Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 via the Competent Authority of Germany, the Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies was asked to deliver an opinion on the scientific substantiation of a health claim related to water and reduced risk of development of dehydration and of concomitant decrease of performance. The scope of the application was proposed to fall under a health claim referring to disease risk reduction. The food, water, which is the subject of the health claim, is sufficiently characterised. The claimed effect is “regular consumption of significant amounts of water can reduce the risk of development of dehydration and of concomitant decrease of performance”. The target population is assumed to be the general population. The Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 defines reduction of disease risk claims as claims which state that the consumption of a food “significantly reduces a risk factor in the development of a human disease”. Thus, for reduction of disease risk claims, the beneficial physiological effect results from the reduction of a risk factor for the development of a human disease. The Panel notes that dehydration was identified as the disease by the applicant. Dehydration is a condition of body water depletion. The Panel notes that the proposed risk factors, “water loss in tissues” or “reduced water content in tissues”, are measures of water depletion and thus are measures of the disease. The Panel considers that the proposed claim does not comply with the requirements for a disease risk reduction claim pursuant to Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006. © European Food Safety Authority, 2011  **TLDR** Article 14 says the product must reduce risk factors for a disease, Profs can't think of a risk factor.  Then the politicians act in accordance with the scientists. That's how it is supposed to work, right? ",9164,480,0,0,1,1,©

S5 certainly seems strange to me, but not *necessarily* problematic, and I'm willing to accept the majority consensus that it's an acceptable axiom.    While I have your expertise at hand, though, I do think Plantinga's argument is a bit sketchy in structure, as well (though in a way that my analogous situation avoids), in the way it handles existing as a property.  To put it in symbolic form, here is what I understand of Plantinga's argument (where MG(x) denotes that entity x possesses maximal greatness, and ME(x,y) = denotes that entity x possesses maximal excellence in world y) . . . apologies in advance if I butcher anything badly, structurally speaking, as I've never actually received formal training/teaching in symbolic logic.

When you aren't more than 2 bases ahead of the Terran, which he wasn't at the time, these sort of loses add up.  2. Losira let the MMM switch do too much damage to him before he was able to switch unit compositions correctly. He also didn't get Mutas out again, and the current metagame dictates that ling/bling/muta is the correct counter to MMM. Infestors do a lot of damage, but between losing Infestros, the added cost of infestors, and the delay between fungal growths, Losira just couldn't keep up.

t5_2qh03,AptMoniker,1321747028,"Although I don't see a new console coming out, as devil's advocate, here's a scenario. When the 360 came out, a big part of the selling point was backwards compatibility. In terms of where we are with what I call DLC thinking &amp; pandering, it's not entirely impossible that the release of a Halo ""720"" version that ""OMG looks better than the 360 version and can only be accessed by purchasing a new console and oh yeah, by-the-way, you now don't have enough money for anything playstation...."" But at least you can stiiiiill play your 360 games! And all your previous stats and information will simply transfer over using Cloud-X® (made up). You see, DLC is less about providing a new experience as it is exploiting/guilting/pandering to the fans just enough so that you'll bite. The thing is, DLC has become so profitable, that it's turning into a game model (ie. MW3). What worse? It's also a model which will breach into the console itself. Obviously, new technology comes around, right? So it makes sense. But what about the instances where it doesn't make sense? The catch is, IT'S A OLD IDEA. BOTH xbox's have had controller upgrades. Each one has less/more affordable versions and themed versions. I actually work for a digital design agency right now, and this is the type of things we come up with. When you think about it, it could happen. Probability? I'm leaning towards exactly what you're saying. They're going to launch when there are titles to flaunt. And if the devkit isn't yet in the right people's hands, nope. That being said, I worry that there are going to be HD versions of games rereleased that aren't even old.

When it is to the right of the logo, is distracting and in a funny place  * the web address is for the home page: http://www.hubcityfencing.com/Hub_City_Fencing_Academy/Hub_City_Fencing.html  that's kinda long, especially for the home page. I'm sure you can trim it down to something more visually appealing  * when I view the site in chrome, I get [this](http://imgur.com/a/FCT0m#0) for some reason. It looks fine in firefox. (look at the other suggestions in the album)  * the ""Find Us On Facebook"" box is a little awkwardly positioned on the home page, I would consider just getting rid of it and replacing it with a simple link to your facebook page  * you ""Links"" section is also awkwardly positioned and vague. Some links direct you to another website and some are links for your website. The ""about us"" link, for example, should be more prominently placed. I'd say you should have a separate page and call it something like ""additional links.""  * the home page seems a bit cluttered, you have a text box labeled ""about us"" and a link for ""about us"", e.g. . Just keep the home page super simple.  * it might be just me, but I find there to be too many columns throughout. there is a lot of looking back and forth on the screen for information  * throw in a nice picture of the outside of your facility somewhere  * if it was me, I'd move the toolbar on the top to the side for improved navigation. If you can, have a drop-down menu appear (like on amazon.com) when you hover over a link. That may clean things up. The links would be (from top to bottom) Home, About us, Why Fence [to be combined with the college section], Our Coaches, Membership Classes &amp; Fees, Fencing Camp, Birthday Parties, Additional Links, Hours &amp; Location, Contact Us. A link could be labeled ""Why Fence?"" and when hovered over ""Fencing &amp; College"" and ""Health Benefits"" could drop down, for example. Might not be a great example, but you get the idea.    * Or maybe a combination of sidebar and top bar. I think that the site logo should be above the links, but that might be a my own preference.  * membership and classes page - it's quite long and should be made more concise. make it so you don't have to scroll all the way down to know what each course you offer is, the ""General Scheduling and Pricing"" surprised me, it didn't look like a link. more tables and charts, less prose   * the site seems a little dark in some places, takes away from the chreey vibe i can tell you'r going for. the contact us page, for example. Very dark text is used on the message box. But then the directions part becomes a large white box all of the sudden, unlike anywhere else on the site.   * reduce the amount of photos in the gallery and get them more varied, maybe bunch them into galleries of when they were taken  * i'd throw a footer at the bottom like the one on reddit that says ""[contact us] - © 2011 HCPA inc. All rights reserved."" or whatever, just something to neatly end every page ",25198,4440,0,0,1,1,©

t5_2qh16,bluestargalaxy4,1321770073,"No I don't think it's arrogant, and yes I do have a narrow understanding of how the brain works. Scientists know a lot about the composition of the brain and have machines that can detect large portions of brain activity. But it doesn't go much further than that when we're talking about consciousness and thought. There's no way to track the path of neurons talking to each other. There's 100 billion neurons in the brain that we can't keep track of. That's a lot of things we don't know. The brain is too complex right now to know a lot about it. We're not there yet. Here's an interesting fact to further prove my point: We know Adderall makes ADHD people focus better, but scientists don't really know why it works. They have theories on why it works, but they don't know for sure. So there they are, scientists not knowing how Adderall works, and here we are talking about knowing when A.I. is going to be a reality in 20 years. Give me a break... We're at the tip of the iceberg in understanding the human brain and no I don't think that that's an overstatement.  Edit: If you don't believe me, take a look at [how Adderall works here.](http://www.adultadhd.net/adderall/) ""Although it is not known exactly how Adderall® works."" And on [Wikipedia here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adderall) ""It is **thought to work** by increasing the amount of dopamine and norepinephrine in the brain."" Anti-depressants are another example of this. Take a look at this [Zoloft commercial.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vfSFXKlnO0&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=20s) ""**While the cause is unknown**, depression **may be** related to an imbalance of natural chemicals between nerve cells in the brain.""",527,1,0,0,1,1,®

You have to get all your mouse settings right, all your ingame settings that are not stored on battlenet. I mean, look at players like flash that bring a ruler to make shure their keyboard is positioned correctly. MLG cannot force players to rush through their games.   3. The length of a game of StarCraft varies greatly from 10 minutes for a bo3 to 1 hour for a single game. MLG has to estimate how long a series is going to take (I think they use 1 hour for a bo3). If they give match more time the next match is more likely to be on time because there is a bigger margin for the transfer.

t5_2qn70,kamins89,1321847778,"Hey I’m a liberal from Europe who supports social democracy. I know, the devil himself. Here is how I would answer your questions (sorry for vague answers I don’t have much time right now). It’s my own opinion, others might think I am crazy and what not ☺, hope it helps:   1.	High taxes alone don’t create jobs, never did. However if you have good welfare programs that secure persons healthcare and education (the basics, that are considered a personal right in most of Europe) allows people to save more for their retirement and other needs. You don’t have to worry if you have saved enough money so that all your children could get college education, or , god forbid, if something terrible happened to your family and you lost your income. Furthermore your spending power increases, because despite paying higher taxes you are still left with significant amount of income that does not need to go to your savings.  2.	Single payer reduces the cost of healthcare because all pay a lower amount for their healthcare. It doesn’t matter if you’re sick or not. However if you get sick you are fully covered. Considering the revenues collected from all people and the costs needed for those who are sick everybody is covered. Furthermore, doctors can have private practice in order to do add to their income, although in developed countries it is not necessary as their salaries are one of the highest from all professions. Your understanding about European countries in wrong, the ones that are bankrupt are because they have no economy (no real industries, etc.) and spend too much compared to what their economy can produce. 3.	For energy I think nuclear is the future (you must be stupid not to thinks its green, one accident is a random occurrence not a trend), although renewable can also work. Consider Denmark. 4.	Individual rights are one thing, societal morals and norms are different. Let me take another example. Consider junk food. There’s a lot of noise about government wanting to tax fat and sugar. Of course conservatives argue that people should choose what they eat! Well obesity is already a huge problem Western Europe, and particularly US. Furthermore it adds up to costs of  healthcare and in turn people cant afford it.. you now the drill. Also, if you care so much about smoking pot than I should urge you to reconsider your priorities.  5.	Give money to the middle class. Since spending has multiplier effect you can collect more revenue over time (this is why you can actually spend yourself out of recession). Cuts are necessary, but not from entitlements. By taking them away you will make people save more, thus taking money out of the economy, which leads to slowdown in growth. If you want to cut, cut defense.  6.	It’s the start and general population views it as fair game. Probably the most important thing everybody needs to understand is that rich do not create jobs. Demand creates jobs. Nobody will work if there is no demand for the crap you’re selling.   7.	Compared to other developed countries US has very low taxes and almost no regulations. Company’s are leaving because they can pay much lower wages for unskilled work. In order to prevent that people have to get educated, i.e become skilled labor. Remember that most of the R&amp;D is still in US. Supply of skilled labor force is the future I think. (Bachelors degree has to become a new high school degree in order for US to lead the future. ).   I think the problem is that conservatives usually take things out of context and make them sound ridiculous. Everything has to work together. However, if you’re really interested in liberal governments read up on Sweden, Germany, Denmark. Remember that conservatives in Europe are democrats in US. US conservatives would be considered radical in Europe, the same as Social Democrats in US.  Sorry for poor English, it’s not my first language. ",1282,5330,0,0,0,1,☺

t5_2cneq,tpowers22,1321903825," The other evening I saw a wonderful documentary on Hugh Romney aka Wavy Gravy, and it got me to questioning as to why I harbor such an animosity against the Right-Wing of this country, and, since they are usually all Republicans, why I harbor such a deep dislike in general of the Republican Party. Firstly, let me say that I know now for certain that after being exposed to the way Wavy Gravy has lived his life of “protesting” for world peace and sanity that I am far from enlightened, and far from wise. Were I so, I would not have this abiding anger towards this political party.   I am a child of the 60’s. I grew up idolizing FDR and The New Deal. In that world, where all was far from perfect, government still managed by presidential and congressional action, to actually provide for the common good. Government was actually the guardian of the welfare of all its citizens, and government actually created jobs by the millions. I am an idealist, and, as the right-wing would label me, a bleeding Heart Liberal. I am proud to wear that union label. In my youth I had such high hopes for my country. I believed, as did my contemporaries, that peace in the world was an achievable dream, and that people, in this country at least, and perhaps in the whole world, could live in peace, free from want, from need, be educated, be productive…in short, I imagined what John Lennon imagined. In the 50’s, like others, I managed to not go to war in Korea, a war presided over by Democratic President Harry S, Truman I might add, realizing it was a part of the cold war’s trumped up “Domino Theory” and, as such, didn’t pass the smell test. It wasn’t my fight, and I believed that if the politicians thought that killing people in Korea was so important, they should strap on a rifle and go kill them themselves. It’s interesting to now see all the Korean products on our roads and shelves. In the 60’s I marched for peace, and was arrested in Washington D.C. protesting the Viet Nam war, and was part of a class-action lawsuit brought against the government for false arrest – which we won. So yes, in many ways this is an amazing country. But that was then, and this is now. Now the country I love is much less amazing. Now my constitution has been violated by people who’ve no clue as to its real intentions, and instead use it to further their mean-spirited agendas. Not only has peace not been achieved, but we now fight three wars at once, and the current Republican desired and designed wars in the Middle East, and their terrible waste of people and treasure, are ludicrous in their transparent lust for hegemony and oil - even as Republicans thwart every effort at alternative energy sources. Also, as far as “terrorism” is concerned, I’ve always thought it a job for Interpol - not whole armies. But of course Dick Cheney, he of Halliburton stock profits, would strongly disagree.  The case for where we now find ourselves as a country can be made against the Republican Right vis-a-vis the accumulated product of the callous, mean spirited, greed inspired, Right-Wing Republican policies over the course of the last half-century. If you check the statistics of job creation by Administration over the last 40 yrs you’ll find that the most jobs were created in descending order, by Johnson, Carter, Clinton, and Kennedy, and the least amount of jobs were created by Nixon, Reagan, Bush I, and, worst of all, Bush II. This alone speaks volumes as to where the Republican bread is buttered. I know that there is enough in this world for everyone never to go hungry, or go without shelter, or medical attention, or an education. Nor is there any rational reason for someone who wants to work to go without a job because they are uneducated or untrained. I know this. No one can tell me otherwise. And yet there are people in this country who think that providing whatever training, or education, or help, there is to all of us is somehow against the “spirit” of laissez-faire Capitalism. Against the “spirit” of the free market because, being the pirates that they are, they see the world as a dog eat dog place, and these same people profess without the least trace of irony, or shame, or embarrassment, to be Christians. This is surely a joke. Please understand, I have no quarrel with wealthy people who are not greedy, who are philanthropists, generous and giving of their time and money as many are. My brief is against the wealthy and connected who can never have enough, and who use their power and position to the detriment of the public at large. Witness their current attack on our working class. Of course, the poor never enter into their metric at all. How these people can bear to see so many in this country go without and continue in their selfish pursuit of power and money above all other things is obscene, and, to me anyway, convincing evidence that they are the most worthless humans among us, and worthy of my abject contempt. Of course these same Right Wing “Christians” who decry Socialism as “dangerous” are not above receiving bail-outs from the Government i.e. Wall Street, and AIG. To the contrary, that form of Socialism - Socialism for the rich - is quite alright in their minds, but paying off people’s mortgages with that same money, or using that money to re-build our infra-structure, and in doing so provide jobs - that would be a kind of Socialism they never could abide to this day. They are the biggest of hypocrites whose only objective is to “game” our system, which laws they have rigged to make it easier for them to do so, in order to amass, and protect by any means necessary, including whole armies, that which they have gained in too many cases by immoral, illegal, or borderline illegal, means. These selfish criminals, who would go to the lengths of pre-emptively starting a war to protect their positions, and profit by this war as well, without the slightest twinge of conscience as to it’s bloody consequences, have managed through the years to turn Socialism into a dirty word. These people persist in their mad uncaring lust to amass more than they could ever need in four lifetimes, and not only amass, but take away from others less fortunate than they by continuing to thwart the chances of people who are in need. And children go hungry; families go without homes, without work, without an education, without hope, just…without. But wait, the Right-Wing does care…they care if gays get married, they care if workers can bargain collectively, and they care that women should not have the right to determine what to do with their own bodies, even in cases of incestuous rape. Of course, these are truly large concerns when placed in juxtaposition to silly things like jobs, homes, education, basic necessities, etc.   This morning’s news has just informed me that one of the richest, fattest Republican pigs, Newt Gingrich - the very name makes my skin crawl – a candidate for President of this country, has been quoted saying of the Occupy Wall Street protesters, “they should get a job, and take a bath.” This person has the sensitivity to say this to a nation whose unemployment number stands at 13.9 million people. Another prominent Republican, Tim Pawlenty has said “suffering is not only necessary, it is essential.” I could never sit down to dinner with this sort of criminal.  There are many reading this who will disagree with me, and that, of course, is their right. I am only trying to explain to you all why I hate the Republican Party with all my heart and soul.   © tony powers and Barking in the Dark, 2011.

Just need to re-stack the order a bit.  - Curtain-puller that makes you go ""Meh."" ☑   - Toilet break a.k.a Diva's Match ☑   - Shameless plug for WWE '12. ☑   - ""Humor"" segment. ☑ (The Rock Chantalong/Singalong, not to mention the idea of Sin Cara being in a live match...)   - 5 vs. 5 decided by RKO out of nowhere. ☒   - Segment ending with John Laurinaitis texting. ☑   - Mark Henry and the Big Show tries for a 15 minute match for the World Heavyweight Championship despite having the stamina for a 3 minute match between them. Henry prevails. ☑   - Shameless plug for WWE '12. ☑   - CM Punk about to win the WWE Championship, gets screwed by Kevin Nash. ☒   - Team Bring the Hate wins clean over Awesome Truth, The Rock proceeds to knock out Cena. Fade to black with Cena sitting in the ring looking to be in pain. ☑  Impressed to see Sheamus getting DQ'd rather than to come across strong and eliminate Swagger and Hunico before getting eliminated and leaving Orton to take out Barret and Rhodes. Instead, Orton ended up putting them over good if they just bother to do something about it in the days to come. Rhodes adds another huge event to his rather handsome resume.  Even more glad to see CM Punk take the belt. Big, big win for him. Unfortunately that just means a rematch at TLC with the storyline hanging suspended from nothing at the moment.   The Rock was electrifying for the total of four minutes he was moving around inside the ring. (He probably was electrifying for the 43 minutes he kept jumping around on the apron as well). So now he'll go back to phoning it in, or sending it in via pony express or whatever he does in order to end up ""trending world wide"", while Cena goes back to being the most booed main event in recent WWE history. There was a tense moment in the end, during the showboating, where I almost expected Cena to do a full heel turn, but rather than to have Cena assault The Rock, they ended up with a perfectly expected turn of events. Cena rolling out and leaving The Rock to celebrate in front of the New York crowd is really something I should have expected.  Also, who the fuck books the Diva's match at 00:20 in a PPV?

One thing that has helped me (and I've heard you're not actually supposed to do this with eczema) is to glob vaseline on my breakouts immediately after washing/drying my hands and right before bed. The spots start to go away after only a day or two of doing this consistently and it also makes my hands really soft. :3 Hope this helps! *Itchy hugs!* xx ♥,552,122,0,0,0,1,♥

t5_2qpp6,TL_poster,1321956251,"###[D/P] League Signature for TL Posts **chaynesore (Australia, 23 posts)**  November 22 2011 16:16 *****  Hey Guys,    So I found this 10-month old thread which seemed to be closest to what I want to talk about:    [http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=192295](http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=192295)    Buuuuut, the idea was only 30% positive (from a small amount of responders) back then and there were a concepts which I didn't agree with myself so I thought I'd take it further and see if there's any interest in this idea today by way of example...      **CONCEPT:**    A small signature added to the bottom of TL forum posts which includes ladder rank and current season stats/etc. For example:    [\[IMAGE\]](http://i.imgur.com/bhzYS.jpg)    I've loved all the changes to TL lately with the new wide format and customisation, and I've always wondered about having some feature like this on the site. I'm thinking this would require some site integration to prevent people posting outrageous images and whatever with BBcodes - possibly just a text box in your main profile settings which lets you input your Bnet profile URL and then takes care of the rest internally. Of course this is easy for me to say when someone else would have to do it - which is why I'm making this post to see if it's actually a good idea or not before bothering any mods.      **MY OWN THOUGHTS/CONCERNS:**    1) Saves people constantly saying ""I'm such and such ranked whatever"" all the time in the constantly-changing ladder seasons.    2) Might cause flaming between players not respecting opinions of lower league kids? On the flip side however, might encourage people to be more respectful to higher ranked players and their opinions? Solution - not everyone has to use it - just revert and get rid of it if it incites too much e-penis waving.    3) I think it might create a useful insight to how players operate at different levels and might hopefully boost the level of respect between players of different leagues (maybe idealistic?).    4) Looks good, simple, clean and does not attract needless attention and clutter up forum posts like the other signature generators going around.    5) Could wildly break format for people looking at the site on mobile view? Maybe just disable for this (somehow)?      Poll: Is this a good idea?    **Yes, definitely.** (31)    62%    **No, forget it.** (16)    32%    **Maybe, but I have some concerns.** (3)    6%    50 total votesYour vote: **Is this a good idea?**([Vote](/userpoll/vote.php?poll_id=28425&amp;vote=0&amp;token=arxgUtZK)): Yes, definitely.  ([Vote](/userpoll/vote.php?poll_id=28425&amp;vote=1&amp;token=arxgUtZK)): No, forget it.  ([Vote](/userpoll/vote.php?poll_id=28425&amp;vote=2&amp;token=arxgUtZK)): Maybe, but I have some concerns.        Hopefully I'm not ""out of line"" in anyway by bringing this up. I just ♥ TL, have some time and am seeing if maybe there's a way I can add something to the community :D      **EDIT:**     *****  *****   ****   ***** ****   *****              *****    *****  ***** [\[Did I get it wrong?\]](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=TL_poster&amp;message=%5BErroneous+Article%21%5D%28%2Fr%2Fstarcraft%2Fcomments%2Fmlbk4%2Fdp_league_signature_for_tl_posts%2F%29%0D%0A%0D%0AYou+may+include+additional+information+here%2C+but+please+leave+the+above+link+intact.&amp;subject=Error+Report)[\[Suggestions/Feedback?\]](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=L_Veritas&amp;subject=Feedback)[\[Changelog\]](http://www.reddit.com/r/L_Veritas_Bots/comments/mcqvb/tl_poster_changelog/)",929,1,0,0,1,1,♥

To get things working right for both a mod developer and the players, it takes a lot of kerjiggering and mucking about just to get it where it MIGHT work. Even then any little update breaks everything.  That and new player-made content is single player only without days of trying to make it compatible only for it to fall apart at the slightest change.

I imagine the party defending the old priest who channels magic into the Ancient Rune Stones© to keep the black, oily mists billowing from the necropolis which was recently unearthed by unusual earthquakes. The dark miasma evaporates around the town when touched by the brilliant light emited by the Runes, but still spits waves of slimy undead which try to stop the ritual.  Even though hunderts of this soulless things fall consumed by the flames, the party need to fight desperately till the sunlight seals the binding. At dawn, as the night loses the fight against the day and the sun appears between the mountain peaks the last city guard falls under grasping claws of the undead. Alas in the Rune Light they still fight as translucent shemes even when their mangled bodies crash to the ground. The rays of sun wander agonizingly slow toward the key stone and few more minutes are needed - suddenly the light of the runes dimish and the time slows down to mere crawl .  The body of the priest laying at the feet if his ghostly presence. In broken voice he whispers ""I am so sorry, I can't give more."" It pains me to ask this from you, were you willing to sacriface a year and a day of your life  to stop this abomination?"".  If the heroes agree, the Runes explode with light like miniature suns.   After blinking the blindness away, the party realizes that they are suddenly standing in a big temple surrounded by hunderds of astonished people. A little more than a year is gone where they stood frozen in time. They are the heroes of the city and nearly everybody is excited when they come alive. Everyone of them lost not only a year of their life, but also is marked with a silver streak of hairs.  Later they discover they can teleport once per day (and once per night) to the rune stones (or fragments of the rune stone).   scnr  An artefact - like a Key that makes any door opened by it a passage to the room where its twin lies. Ring allowing the use of Mirror Pathways ( the space behind the mirror). Or let the get kind of bag of holding which is in reality a doorway to an ""abandoned"" fortress.  On the other hand all that are just places.  I can imagine that if you introduce an group of NPCs which the party befriends it could offer the same possibilities. Maybe a troupe of gypsies - after saving some of them from trouble the party runs every now and then into them. Not always the same group, but they seems to recognize the players and help them as much they can.  With transport, food, crafts or informations.

Let me say once again that there are generally a third more greens in any fighting weyr since they are the fighter pilots, whose skills often saved the larger and less flexible dragons from getting Thread scored. Any Weyrleader welcomed with great relief the presence of each new green rider. But, since the greens are small and have exchanged speed and manoeuvrability for stamina, they generally fly only half of a Fall, being sent back to the Weyr to rest, returning only if a Fall lasts longer or is heavier than normal.   The blues are stronger, have a wider thrust of flame, and can last an entire Fall. The browns are stronger yet, with a wider and long thrust of flame, which is another reason they are often appointed as wingseconds. The bronze, of course, is the strongest of the fighters, having great depths of reserve and the most potent flame in length, depth and duration: the bombers you might say. They are invariably wingleaders, with two wingseconds, either or both of whom can be browns.   The queens don't like to be left out of the action and flame-throwers were their method of defence since they can't digest firestone. They fly low as the best way to catch whatever Thread might escape the upper level flights.   Back again to the different sexes involved. The greens, like their little cousins, are extremely affectionate, flirtatious, and when in season can be quite a problem to the Weyrleaders. However, some long-term unions were formed between greens and any of the other colors, bar the bronzes who always hope to make the queen theirs in her next mating flight. The greens oblige any of the males including bronzes...or we'd have a heap of sexually frustrated, very unhappy virgin male dragons.   As the queen is wholly heterosexual, larger and stronger than even the largest bronze, and certainly any browns, she mates infrequently and only when she feels an irresistible urge to procreate. (To be totally whimsical, she's catholic, you might say.) Nevertheless, she is not as amenable to being caught as the greens are. She makes quite a show of her sensuality, evades and taunts all the dragons rising with her in a mating flight. As she is larger and stronger, her stamina is considerable. The bronze that catches her has to be the smartest, strongest and fastest of the flight. The higher he can take her before linking with her, the longer he has to impregnate her which means a stronger and larger clutch. The stronger the impact of that mating is on the two riders also improves the clutch since the male is not inhibited by the queen rider's indifference. (It's no wonder Nemorth has so few dragons-she could barely get off the ground and neither S'loner, F'lon nor R'gul could stand the female.) If Weyrleader and Weyrwoman are totally compatible, clutches invariably reflect that accord and include more of the larger dragons, and possibly a queen.   There is a rational chain of command for very obvious reasons - ESPECIALLY DURING FALL. I designed my Pern Air Force quite carefully and, if it seems sexist to readers in this decade, I make no apologies for the world I designed thirty years ago: LONG before it ever occured to me that the World of Pern© would be online and subjected to alterations that contradict its basic traditions and canons.   This is my world, folks. I designed it. I haven't changed the design. When I gave permission for online games of Pern, I was assured by you, or your predecessors, that these traditions and social entities would be scrupulously followed. Most of you, and I thank you from the bottom of my heart, have kept that bargain.   Therefore you will not try to out-persona another member of your group and teach Maid Marian karate kicks and how to shorten her costumes despite the draughts that were prevalent in 12th century castles. Nor will you design newer bigger better models of the Ninja Turtles or Hercules with a Valley accent. War is not a word in the Pernese vocabulary. It's one reason so many people would like to live there. Including me.   Which brings me to my final point. Recently, I discovered that there may be quite a few players of the various sorts of Pern games who have never read a single Pern novel. They just enjoy playing games. Which is fine by me but causes some of the problems, which have been plaguing me, the Sysops, the Wizards or whoever runs the online games (It was for the fanzines.) Not that this is a ploy to sell more books because one can borrow one from a friend, who HAS read a Pern book, or the local library.   Reading a Pern book gives the player much more of the 'feel', the 'ambience' of the planet that so intrigues games players. And it also lays out the rules, and the whys of those rules, again and again. It also gives you insights into a persona that might be better than the travesties that have come to my attention.

But I don't eat pork and I don't like vinegar.  **Favorite 3 types of Candy:** chocolate covered nuts, peppermint candy and caramel.  **Chocolate Yes/No:** Kind of. Only if it has nuts, caramel and/or wafer/biscuit e.g. Twix, Almond Snickers, KitKat, almond Mars bars, chocolate with fruit and nut, etc.  **Favorite Scent**: Crisp/flowery scents. I find that I more likely than not will like any scent that has ""white"", ""crisp"", ""cotton"", ""mountain"", ""ocean"", ""linen"" or ""fresh"" in its name.  **Do you have any Hobbies?** I'm on the internet, mostly. Does that count? XD But I read, bake, cook, craft and write.  **Favorite Author/Genre of Book:** Fantasy and Teen Fiction. I really love Madeleine L'Engle, and highly respect JRR Tolkien. Currently reading Robin Hobb and George RR Martin, and both are quickly becoming favorites. I guess JK Rowling too.  **Favorite type of animal:** PANDAS! BUNNIES! KITTENS! PUPPIES! TARSIERS!  **Movie you would like to own:** Practical Magic. I don't know why, but it's one of my favorite movies of all time. Matilda is also a classic. When I was a kid, I could practically recite the entire movie dialogue off the top of my head.  **Favorite Color:** Pink. Blue (especially turquoise and electric). Lilac. Purple. Yellow. Green.  **What person (dead/alive) you would like to meet?** I honestly think it would be intriguing to interview Adolf Hitler. He's like the sane kind of crazy, so it would be pretty surreal to kind of view his thought process. Lady Gaga would be cool too. JRR Tolkien would be fascinating to interview.   **Favorite Music Artist/Type:** I love music in general, and I'm willing to give anything a listen. I'm just not really a fan of rap, techno, house and R&amp;B, though I'm willing to give those a try too if they come recommended highly enough.  **Do you Collect Anything?**Wind chimes.  **Favorite Stores to shop at:**I...don't really like to shop. However, I like H&amp;M and Tokidoki. But I'm really just a shirt, jeans/shorts and sneakers kind of girl. I also love cute/humorous/geeky shirts.  **Favorite Drink:** Water. I'm boring like that. I hate soda ;w;  **Favorite Sports Team/Athlete:** YUNA KIM. She's like a fairy on ice ♥  **Favorite Time of the Year:** The cold season...as cold as it gets in a tropical country anyway :/  **One Place You Would Like to Visit:** IRELAND! :D  **Favorite Magazines:** I don't really read magazines. I just read whatever's lying around the house.  **Favorite Restaurants to Eat at:**Japanese, Mexican and Italian.  **Favorite TV Show:**Lie To Me  **Breakfast, Lunch, or Dinner?** All of it. Just feed me good food. But breakfast for dinner is the best.  **One Actor or Actress You Would Want to Meet:**Angelina Jolie, because there's so many things being said about her, I just want to know what's really up with her. Lol.  **Favorite Movie Theatre:** The clean ones.  **Coffee or Hot Chocolate?** Either. It will depend on my mood.  **Favorite Type of Cookie:** Oatmeal-cranberry.  **Apple or PC?** Either. Though if we're talking gaming, it's definitely the PC.  **My favorite part of the day is:** Sunset. I look forward to every sunset because I never know what color combination it will be that day.  **If I ruled the world:** I would put people through a mandatory time-pressured maze with IQ- and EQ-testing obstacles. People who fail will be considered the ""lower class"" and will have strict procreation limitations imposed upon them. Those who prove to be unable to control their ""urges"" will be sterilized.  **Anything else your SS should know:** I'm a pretty easy-going person (except when it comes to ruling the world. That shit's srsbznz.) and I'm fairly easy to please. If at a loss, just think of what an overgrown five year old pixie might like. And there's your answer :D",1780,1452,0,0,0,1,♥

t5_2r2jt,mangarooboo,1322212782,"Reading this made me ache and want to cry. Story time :/  **TL;DR: My mom also has frequent bouts of gastrointestinal distress that can have her in and out of the bathroom all day/night; I used to be almost constantly annoyed with her about it and now I try to be more understanding. I just needed to vent about the guilt I feel about how I used to be annoyed. :(**  My mom got gastric bypass surgery a year and a half ago and is in more or less constant gastric distress as a result. She can't drink anything with dinner or she won't digest it, she can't eat too much because it'll make her nauseous, and if she eats too quickly, it'll all basically come back up (or want to). My dad and I are aware of this and try to remind her not to eat too much/too quickly/crappy food, but we can't control what she eats all the time.  Sometimes she does eat too much or she eats what she has too quickly or whatever, and she has to sort of sit back and relax and try not to get sick at the table. My dad and I can tell right away what's up so we gauge if it's actually serious or if it's just the regular old run-of-the-mill nausea. If it's regular stuff, we ignore it because: A) she doesn't want to talk about it, B) we don't want to talk about it, and C) we already know what's wrong, we've had many a discussion about it, and it's just the same thing every time.  At first, when it was all new to her, she'd inform us every time she was having distress. It got to the point where my dad and I knew what was going on before she mentioned it but she told us about it anyway. I don't know about him, but I got a little resentful of how she assumed we had no idea what was going on. That slowly branched out into other physical ailments of hers (she has terrible shoulders that aren't much good for lifting anything heavier than bubble wrap), and I'd get frustrated hearing her explain time and time again why she needs me to lift this giant box.   ""My arms just can't do it.""   '*I GOT it mom, I'll do it, just stop telling me it hurts!*'  I've realized recently, however, that she's only talking about all this because it frustrates her to no end that she can't eat stuff the way she used to and she can't lift stuff the way she used to. It's been a bit of a trial, but I've trained myself to not let my first reaction be annoyance or frustration, but compassion instead. Tonight, for instance, was Thanksgiving. Mom ate way too much way too quickly, and her stomachache came suddenly and without mercy. She looked up at me and gave me ""panic eyes,"" which basically ask me what she thinks I should do using eye contact. I nodded and mouthed, *""go""* to her, meaning ""Go to the bathroom right fucking now and to hell with the company, I'll check up on you in a few minutes."" She got up and bailed. She ended up being pretty okay, but I wandered to the back bathroom to check on her a few minutes later. She mentioned that she appreciated that I can always tell what the matter is and how to handle the situation.  Ugh, I guess... the reason why I sat here writing this for a while is I'm really, really sorry you have family members that shun you for something that isn't your fault. I never got to the point where I'd say anything to my mom's face, but she probably knew from looking at my facial expressions that I was irritated about something. I feel awful about ever feeling that way. I wish I could give your whole family a talking to or something. :/ Reading your story made me feel really sad.

t5_2qh1i,HatHatHatHat,1322250504,"Female here. First time post, and my heart is beating like a drum because I really identified with this thread but am wildly nervous about posting.  I was a butt ugly kid. Early-bloomer tomboy who thought the world was a rip-off for females because it seemed like as a girl, you had to sell your soul to be something that boys liked, and that being yourself just wouldn't cut it. On top of it, I was a smarty pants (borderline obnoxiously so) and was moved up a grade in primary school. One day at about the age of 16 my mom sat me down and gave me her version of a ""makeover"" and within weeks I had a steady boyfriend. (think Princess Diaries Anne Hathaway before/after) I played a lot of sports, and grew quite tall- having a 34'' inseam, so use your imagination there. When I was a senior, I remember walking down the hall in a tight cardigan and plaid mini skirt and upon seeing me and checking me out up and down one of the most popular guys at school loudly yelled, ""You get my vote for MOST CHANGED!"" because I think I was fairly invisible until I dressed my curves and made up my face.   I have been told I look like Cindy Crawford, Jessica Simpson, Kate Winslet, and a whole bunch of other really random celebs that don't look much like each other. I have strong facial features that got me some cash modeling, but they're a unique kind of beauty.    **PROS**   *it is a lot easier to get what you want in a tense situation, especially if you are reasonable, nice, and understanding. Playing a little dumb really helps, because people assume you're only what you look like on the outside. This has saved my ass so many times, and the asses of my friends who recruit me to go untangle a situation with a soothing voice and a pretty face. It got me out of a huge fine overseas, and many late fees, getting friends out of the back of cop cars, etc. However it does take confidence and empathy as well- but the face definitely opens the door and I know this.  *I know for the time being (until my youth runs out) I will always be able to find someone to date.   *I made money with my looks- promo, print, and runway modeling, and it was good money.   *Free stuff- deals, coupons, even calls my way during sports. Not every day, mind you, but every so often.   *A's in certain classes from creepy teachers and profs.   *drinks at bars, ashamedly.   *getting attention first, before anyone else, even if I am not seeking it or there's a huge line/crowd etc.    **neutrals**  *I feel as if for some reason, the way I look specifically makes people assume things about me and by this I mean the actual shape of my face and body. I am not ""cute"" nor ""pretty"" like Emma Watson, Hillary Duff, or Jessica Alba. I am more Veronica Lake/Cindy Crawford. My ex recently got a new girlfriend and my mom showed a co-worker the picture of his new girlfriend. The co-worker said, ""Well that girl is really pretty, but your daughter is stunning."" So whatever that means.  I think my face looking the way it does combined with my height and shape makes me radiate some kind of accidental sexuality. Doesn't matter if I am in sweats or tight jeans. I don't know if I like this or hate this, because clearly I could use it to my advantage however when you feel people's eyes constantly lasering a layer off your skin off it begins to mess with your head. I also think that I scare a lot of people away, I have heard many a time how intimidating it was to come and approach me. I have started dressing really effeminately so that people think I am cuter, sweeter, like I want to feel more innocent or something... I feel as if the second I put on a pantsuit or a pencil skirt, everyone sees me as this crazy man-eater who will steal your husband and your job, breaking hearts as I please along the way. I don't know how I feel about it all. For example last night a married friend of mine and I were going to check on someone outside of a bar, and his wife quietly freaked out and insisted on coming with. Crap like that, seriously... I don't know what to do about it.    **CONS**  *People hate you. People want everything to see you fall into disastrous ruin. If I had a nickel for every time I have heard, ""Man, I HATED you until I got to know you!"" I would have like, $1.00. The rumors that are started, especially when you look like a sex-bunny, are terrible. YES, I want to be pretty, YES, I wear makeup, and so technically speaking it is my own fault! BUT it doesn't mean I am going to steal your boyfriend or take all the attention away from you at whatever social function we're going to! I am not a threat! Seriously!  *I have no close female friends. Zilch.    *Any intelligence or authority you have is automatically challenged because people don't want you to be attractive and smart, or in a position of power. I have learned people only like you to be one or the other. This was hard adjusting to in grad school. My peers really critically assess anything I produce (which I guess just makes it better in the long run) however the criticism isn't equally distributed.   *Men want to possess me. Like keep me fenced up or in a tower, and nothing makes me feel worse about myself. I also hate the testosterone fueled 'tude given off by the seemingly most humble and non-overprotective guys that I somehow inspire.   *I am terrified of growing old, because I know I am going to be perceived as a total cougar.     *something you should know*  I consider myself to be pretty smart, no- really smart. I am unafraid and confident, and I believe the combination of my brain and my face are to blame for this. I guess this makes me intimidating, however I was a total ugly duckling. This means I know what insecurity, jealousy, and envy feel like. This also means I know what revenge means for someone with scorned feelings.  The best advice I was given was by my cousin who told me that popular people aren't always the best looking, but rather popular people are nice to everyone regardless. Being nice to everyone and treating everyone like people generally means that it is reciprocated, and therefore you will become popular.   IF I am genuinely nice to you because I want to get to know you, and you just reciprocate with hate because of the way I look... I will remember it. And if I am feeling really immature, or hurt, or somehow my pride has been trampled on because I have tried so hard to earn your respect and you haven't given me the slightest chance? I promise you that the next time I know you and I are going to be at the same social function that I will wear my very most flattering pencil skirt and deep cut blouse, those ridiculously sexy heels that make me about 9'' taller than you, my very most favorite bombshell lipstick, and I think since I wear my hair up just about every day, I'll set it in long, flowing waves.   And so, I become what you want me to be. I hate myself for it for perpetuating something I should know better than doing, you hate me for it because you feel like an ugly little grub, and god kills a kitten.   ♥  ",24,2,0,0,1,1,♥

t5_2qh1i,bassett_horn,1322346980,"guy here, and IMHO this is the main difference between males and females regarding friends:   - To men, a friend is someone we *do something with* (sports, hiking, watch movies, play music, play video games, etc).   - To women, a friend is a non-sexual soulmate.   Guys tend to understand that our friendship is *limited*. Even when we're very good friends with another guy (ie, we talk about Big Issues and ask for Serious Advice), we usually know that our two lives only overlap a little bit. We know that the other guy has a job, a family, a girlfriend/wife, other hobbies, etc. Male friendships are often ""emotionally shallower"" than female friendships (and I mean that in a good sense, as explained below).   In contrast, lots of modern American women seem to expect that their friends be ""non-sexual soulmates."" The trouble is, ""soulmates"" are an illusion. No one is perfect. You'll have fights and disgreements with everyone. No one will approve of everything about you or the way you live. The intense emotional bonding of female friendships is a double-edged blade: it can provide a powerful sense of community and understanding. But, as you've learned, the downside is that you're desperate for the approval of your friends. That's simply unhealthy.   So how to change? Be a bit more like a guy. Seriously. Next time you make new female friends, resist the urge to make the discussion all about your Feelings® and her Feelings® and the *meaning* of your Feelings®, etc. If you don't have an ""active"" hobby, get one: exercise, playing cards, playing guitar, whatever. And cultivate friendships that are built *only* around that activity. ",48,1,0,0,1,1,®

t5_2qnng,TheFlyingBastard,1322433752,"&gt; Were you allowed to socialize with non-Jehovah's?  Yes, I was allowed to socialize with non-JWs, but the Watchtower Society (which is kinda like what the Vatican is to the catholic church) strongly discouraged that. The JW faith is a very divisive one. It's us vs. them. If you are a JW, you are ""in the truth"". If you are not JW, you are ""in the world"" and thus part of the devil's world. So socializing was allowed, but don't get too attached.  &gt; Did you feel like you were correct in what you were doing?  Absolutely, 100%, totally correct. The grass is green, the sun rises in the morning and God exists. It was all part of ""reality"" as I was taught. It felt good to ""know"" that I was on the winning side of some kind of spiritual war, one with all of mankind at stake. I felt privileged to have this deep understanding of who God was and what his plans were. I had it figured out! If only other people would see what I saw; their lives depended on it, I had to help save them!  &gt; How did holidays feel? How did it feel being pulled from school on Halloween?  I'm Dutch, so I never went through Halloween, but there was still stuff like Christmas. I was always a very easy child, so I never complained. I never really cared about those parties. I still don't. I do, however, remember that my sister picked me up from school when I was five or six, and someone in my class had their birthday. They had popcorn to celebrate. I had some, because hey, popcorn, right? So my sister picked me up from school, put me on the back of her bike and softly, with all the love in the world, told me that was not what Jehovah wanted. I felt a bit guilty, but I just nodded and kept eating. Because hey, popcorn!  &gt; What are your beliefs now? How does it feel looking back?  I am now an atheist. There has been, so far, not enough evidence for me to believe in the existence in a god, but I could be wrong. (Some would call this agnosticism; William Lane Craig calls this ""ahhh-theism"", and I say weak atheism.) But I am also sure as one can be that Yahweh/Jehovah does not exist (strong atheism). I've done some reading on how Yahweh started out, developed, etc. and that kind of put that god on the same level of likelihood as... say... The Little Mermaid. I feel pretty silly, thinking back. But oh well, I was ignorant and gullible... All I can do now is fix that as much as possible.  &gt; Any stories?  Well, there's one thing that the Society needs above all: information control. Having access to good information is exactly what [turned me atheist](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/g7tnt/another_jehovahs_witness_bit_the_dust_or_how_i/). They tell you it's okay to scrutinize your beliefs, but if you disagree you're wrong. Most likely members would not even come to the point of ever disagreeing, because JWs have their own ecosystem of information. Everything is regulated. Do you want to know something about the bible? Anything at all? The JWs have The Truth®. You don't need to look anywhere else. Especially not on the site of apostates because they are unwittingly in the pay of Satan and are out to pull you away from your loving heavenly father, etc.  Having thrown all my beliefs overboard and going back to basic, I was of course free to pursue more knowledge from *secular* sources. It was absolutely refreshing, like you just came from your lazy chair, opened the front door and stepped out into the sun.  I became absolutely fascinated with science, especially with that one subject they have been lying to me so thoroughly about: evolution. Right now I am studying to become a lab worker, though I am not a good student at all. I have to try though, I must learn as much I can.

A leaking valve on a tanker spread driveway sealant over the eastbound lanes of a long stretch of the Turnpike between New Castle and the Oakmont Service Plaza on Tuesday night, Turnpike spokesman Bill Capone said. Turnpike operations officials on Wednesday said 150 or more cars were disabled when the sticky goo covered their tires and wheels. Some state police and turnpike maintenance vehicles had to be towed away after getting stuck in the tar-like substance, according to the turnpike operations center. Traffic was moving normally by Wednesday morning, but the sticky mess had already hindered the travel plans of some motorists traveling for the Thanksgiving holiday.  Laura Frick told WTAE-TV she was traveling from Cleveland to New Jersey for the holiday. ""Now we have to turn around and go back home,"" Frick said. ""It's horrible.""  Retired firefighter Bob King told the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review the experience was the most harrowing of his life. ""It caught us off guard,"" said King, who now lives near Chicago. ""It didn't seem like anyone knew what it was or what to do. It had to be an incredible amount of tar. It's still piled on my tires.""  Cpl. Mike Corna, with the state police barracks which patrols the pike near Pittsburgh, said Wednesday the driver will be cited for not properly securing his load, though the specific tickets to be issued were still being determined. Police have yet to trace the origin of the load. The tank was filled somewhere in Ohio.  Maintenance crews got out quickly, dumping sand on the pooled goop and using snow plows to push it on to the shoulder, turnpike spokesman Carl DeFebo said. The mess was mostly confined to the right lane and the roadway didn't have to be shut down while workers tried to clean it up because the substance hardens in about 15 minutes, DeFebo said.  ""It's been cleaned up since about 11 o'clock last night,"" DeFebo said Wednesday. Turnpike officials urged motorists whose cars were damaged to stop calling its operations center and instead call Traveler's Insurance at 800-238-6225 and follow the prompts to file ""business claims.""  The insurance company is handling claims on behalf of Marino Transport Services of Stevensville, Md., which operates the truck.  Copyright © 2011 The Associated Press.

t5_2qh9z,Rivensteel,1322628986,"Short answer: Hereditary angioedema  Long answer:  Medical Mysteries: Abdominal pain has been diagnosed, but it’s not curable  By Sandra G. Boodman, Published: November 28  For years before the identity of her long-standing problem was revealed, Hannah Love’s family had its own name for the periodic, disabling episodes: “Hannah’s stomach thing.”  The attacks, which first struck when she was 3, would gradually progress from discomfort to a crescendo of sharp pains to an abdomen so swollen she could not bear the touch of clothing. Nausea and vomiting invariably followed.  “Usually I would lie down in front of the TV with a bowl until it passed,” recalled Love, now 38. Between episodes, which lasted 24 to 48 hours and occurred on average every few weeks, she was fine.  Doctors initially shrugged off the problem, figuring it would pass. They prescribed drugs that didn’t help and ran tests that found nothing. After conventional medicine provided no answer, her family turned to a host of alternative therapies that proved equally useless.  “It was humiliating to not have a name for something that was so clearly present in my life,” recalled Love, an associate editor at the University of California Press in Berkeley who grew up in nearby Oakland. “I was thinking, ‘How could they believe me?’ ’’ Doctors had told her parents that they thought the problem was psychological; one doctor suspected she was bulimic, which Love vehemently denied.  So when, at age 17, she learned the name and cause of the problem that had dominated her life, Love was surprised to feel oddly disappointed.  “I was sort of like — what? All those years and it was just a blood test?” she recalled telling her mother. The doctor who ordered the test remembers his distinctly different reaction. “I probably had ordered this test 10 times, but hers is the only one that came back positive,” said Ronald Adler, a retired gastroenterologist who remembers the details of Love’s case more than 20 years later. “I was relieved and happy that at least we had an answer. I remember being more worried about how to treat it.”  Trying alternative remedies  Until she was 6, Love said, her pediatricians didn’t do much except offer advice about possible symptomatic relief in the hope that the problem, whatever it was, would go away as she got older. Antibiotics didn’t help, and Love was growing normally so it didn’t seem likely that she had a malabsorption problem. A specialist suggested an endoscopy, a procedure that involves threading a tube down the throat and into the stomach to inspect the upper GI tract, which Love’s mother vetoed because she considered it overly invasive.  Frustrated by the lack of progress, Love’s mother turned to alternative medicine.  For the next several years, until she was about 11, Love received various unconventional treatments. She saw a homeopathic physician who treated her with herbs and other substances. She underwent biofeedback, psychic healing, nutritional treatments and Reichian therapy, which involves massage and breathing exercises.  All failed, although the homeopath noticed that Love exhibited “rebound” abdominal tenderness: pain when pressure is released, not applied. Most commonly a sign of appendicitis, which had been ruled out much earlier, it can also indicate swelling.  Because most of the practitioners saw her only when she was well, “they tended to interpret my symptoms in a diffuse way,” she said. But Love and her family, exquisitely attuned to her “stomach thing,” had discerned patterns: attacks seemed linked to stress, excitement and fast food.  “We were the experts,” she recalled. “We knew how to get through the attacks, how to inform my school and teachers. We knew that travel, sleepovers, parties, all came with the risks that I could become sick.”  Her robust health between episodes added to the diagnostic confusion. It also “made denial a little easier than with some chronic conditions, because no matter how many times I would get sick, in the back of our minds there was this constant hope that maybe it wouldn’t happen again,” Love said. As she got older and became more embarrassed by her illness, she tried to hide it, which was difficult given her frequent absences from school.  Around age 13, her mother began taking her to a new round of specialists. One recommended exploratory surgery for a possible intestinal obstruction, although a CT scan later found none. A pediatric gastroenterologist suspected Meckel’s diverticulum, a small vestigial bulge in the intestine that can cause pain and swelling, which was also ruled out. A third suggested that her problem was an abdominal migraine, whose stomach symptoms mimic those felt in the head. Love’s mother rejected the doctor’s recommendation that her daughter take potent drugs to combat it.  When she was 15, Love developed a new symptom: the abdominal attacks were accompanied by swelling in her hands, feet and, more ominously, her throat.  A rheumatologist was stumped and sent her to an allergist; food allergy testing detected only a mild sensitivity to wheat. The allergist referred her to Adler, a new gastroenterologist, for a colonoscopy. The day she saw him in May 1990, Love was recovering from an attack and sported a circular red rash on her chest.  A tip-off and a test  “I think in gastroenterology, unexplained abdominal pain is attributed to irritable bowel syndrome,” Adler said, recalling that he immediately ruled out this catchall diagnosis. “People with IBS are never quite satisfied with their digestive function,” he said. By contrast, Love felt fine between attacks.  “That was the tip-off,” Adler said. So was the rash.  Adler told Love and her mother that he wanted to hold off on the colonoscopy and order specialized blood tests. From his earliest days in practice, Adler said, he always carried “a short list of exotic things” tucked in the back of his mind in case more common causes didn’t explain a patient’s problem.  The blood test showed what Adler suspected. After 14 years, “Hannah’s stomach thing” finally had a scientific name: hereditary angioedema, or HAE, a serious disorder marked by swelling and caused by a deficiency in a blood protein called a C1 inhibitor.  The disorder, which often surfaces in childhood, was once called angioneurotic edema, because doctors erroneously thought it had a psychological cause. First described in 1882, angioedema most often affects the gastrointestinal tract; in some patients it can cause swelling so dramatic that it resembles the late stages of pregnancy. Death can result if throat swelling occurs and emergency treatment isn’t administered in time. And in about 30 percent of patients, a non-itchy rash accompanies a swelling attack, which can be triggered by stress.  There is no cure for the condition, which affects about one in 50,000 Americans, according to the Genetics Home Reference. Although most cases are familial, about 20 percent, Love’s among them, occur as the result of a spontaneous genetic mutation. The child of a person with HAE has a 50 percent chance of developing it.  When her mother called with the news, minutes after she had spoken to Adler and learned the diagnosis, Love said she was stunned. “More than anything, I remember not believing her,” she said. “At that point, I thought there was no way we were ever going to figure it out.”  The news was bittersweet, because there is no cure for HAE and treatment options were so limited. Adler prescribed one drug that didn’t help. Love, who was about to go to college in Massachusetts, decided against the only other possibility at the time: long-term corticosteroids, which carry a host of side effects, including weight gain and mood swings. “I had come that far living through the attacks, and I wasn’t going to do it,” she said.  She joined the National Organization for Rare Disorders, a support and advocacy group, and met other HAE patients, which she said greatly helped. “It didn’t seem possible that anybody had been living the same bizarre reality I had,” she said.  Over the years Love has been involved in clinical trials of various experimental drugs. For the past four years she has self-administered infusions of Cinryze. The prophylactic therapy has largely eliminated Love’s attacks, but it remains one of the world’s most expensive prescription drugs, according to Forbes; a year’s supply costs about $350,000. Love said her insurance covers the cost. Before the last year’s federal health-care overhaul law abolished lifetime caps on coverage, she worried about burning through her $2 million limit.  Her 16-year-old son, she said, has tested negative for the disorder, while her 10-year-old daughter shows no signs of the problem but has not yet been tested.  Love said that despite her ordeal, she doesn’t wish she had been spared the disorder that has shaped her life. “I gained a lot of attributes having to live with it and through it,” she said. “It definitely made me who I am.”  If you have a medical mystery that’s been solved, we’d like to hear about it.

t5_2qh33,wmsalfiacarla,1322646762,"Hanukkah vodka ad pulled after protests from Jewish groups By Elizabeth Flock A New York City billboard advertising cheap vodka with the slogan “Christmas Quality, Hanukkah Pricing” was taken down after the company received a number of complaints from customers, as well as from the Anti-Defamation League. The Wódka vodka promotion features two dogs, one in a Santa hat and the other in a yarmulke.   (Anti-Defamation League ) “In a crude and offensive way of trying to make a point that their vodka is high quality and inexpensive, the billboards evoke a Jewish holiday to imply something that is cheap and of lesser value when compared to the higher value of a Christian holiday,” ADL regional director Ron Meier said. It “reinforces anti-Semitic stereotypes.”  The creative lead on the campaign, Brian Gordon, says he is Jewish and the campaign wasn’t intended to be offensive. He says the ad wanted to convey that Hanukkah was an “understated” holiday.  “As a Jew growing up, the only thing we could say was we had eight nights, and Christmas had only day, so we had eight days for the price of one,” he told CNN. “With our brand, our message is you can get more for less, eight nights versus one, and we don't need to wrap ourselves in fancy packaging.”  The vodka company has been unapologetic for its shock advertising in the past, with ads that read: “Hamptons Quality. Newark Pricing” and “Escort Quality. Hooker Pricing.” This time, Wódka sang a different tune:   By	 Elizabeth Flock  |  09:03 AM ET, 11/23/2011   Tags:  National, Ads, Hannukah, Christmas    inShare Tumblr Reddit Stumbleupon Digg Delicious  Previous: Helicopter crashes installing Christmas tree; pilot limps away (Video)  Next: Anne McCaffrey, sci-fi author of Pern series, is dead  Weigh In Discussion Policy About Discussions, Badges  LOG INREGISTER + SHARE THIS DEBATE You are not logged in.

t5_2qh18,ethraax,1322670920,"&gt; Gabe Gravning, Senior Product Marketing Manager, AMD - We worked with Microsoft to improve the way threads are scheduled with the ""Bulldozer"" architecture in Windows 8®. In Windows 7, workloads are simply executed sequentially across the cores. The Windows 8 scheduler is optimized for the ""Bulldozer"" architecture and will distribute the workload across each core pair first and then each core resulting in better threaded performance.  &gt; For example, in testing by AMD with the AMD FX-8150, we are seeing up to 10% uplift on a number of games with the Windows 8 Developer Preview compared to Windows® 7. Of course, results do vary.  &gt; We are also working with Microsoft on a scheduler update for Windows 7 that will be available soon.   What about Linux?  Does Linux 3.1 recognize Bulldozer chips and schedule threads in a more optimal manner?  I would have liked them to at least mention Linux, because they seemed to be aiming for servers, most of which run Linux.  Furthermore, they can actually directly contribute code to Linux in a way that they probably can't with Windows.",47281,4,0,0,1,1,®
