For further reading on the possibility of aluminum corrosion with the standard formulation, a simple search on [Simple Green Corrosion](http://www.google.com/search?=UTF-8&amp;q=simple+green+corrosion)  brings up other people's experiences with it.    Based on my personal experience, I won't be using Simple Green on any firearm or component, since I want finish to stay where it is and don't want any corrosion on aluminum parts if I choose to soak them.

t5_6,jowiburger,1301726999,"JowiART Design  JowiART Design focust op industriële vormgeving en interieur- en architectuurontwerpen  ‘Haagse Portiekdeur’ een creatief gebruik van ruimte geïnspireerd door Frank Lloyd Wright  Ontwerp van een deur in een ‘Haags Portiek’ in een appartementengebouw in Den Haag ontworpen rond 1933 volgens de ‘Nieuwe Haagse School’ – architectuur (1925 – 1940).  Reden voor het ontwerp van de Haagse Portiekdeur: verbetering van de veiligheid en besparing van energie. Een Haags Portiek bestaat uit een ruimte, waarin een hardstenen trap is aangebracht, die leidt naar een bordes, waarop een of meer appartementen uitkomen. Het gebruikelijke Haagse Portiek omvat een enorme ruimte meestal gevormd door de voorgevel van het gebouw – in veel gevallen voorzien van een of meer langgerekte vensters met prachtig glas in lood, de muren van het appartement op de benedenverdieping en de eerste verdieping, de trap, het bordes en het plafond. In de periode van de Nieuwe Haagse School architectuur, in het bijzonder geïnspireerd door de Amerikaanse architect Frank Lloyd Wright, was energiebesparing niet een ‘hot topic’ in appartementengebouwen. Verder brandt er in Haagse portieken vaak geen of weinig licht in de avond en 's-nachts en deze portieken hebben hoeken waar men niet kan worden gezien. Daarom zijn inbraken en drugsoverlast een probleem in Haagse portieken. Tegenwoordig zoekt men naar oplossingen, die niet alleen leiden tot energiebesparing maar tegelijkertijd de veiligheidsproblemen oplossen.  JowiART Design heeft een ontwerp gemaakt in 2007, dat op een originele en creatieve wijze energie bespaart en de veiligheid bevordert in Haagse Portieken . Het ontwerp behelst een verlaagd plafond, dat is verbonden met een deurkozijn, welk geplaatst is op de 12de trede. Omdat er een meningsverschil met de autoriteiten is ontstaan over de plaatsing van een deur op de 12de trede, is een alternatieve oplossing uitgewerkt. Deze alternatieve oplossing omvat het ontwerp van een voorportaal op het bordes waarbij voldoende ruimte wordt gelaten op het bordes staande voor de deur van het voorportaal. Dit blijkt een vereiste te zijn volgens geldende bouwregels.  In een gewijzigde versie van het ontwerp wordt het verlaagde plafond gehandhaafd en uitgebreid om met het voorportaal verbonden te kunnen worden. De ruimte tussen het originele plafond en het verlaagde plafond is ongeveer 2 meter tot 1,5 meter vanaf de ingang van de trap, die omhoog gaat, maar kan in andere gevallen meer bedragen. De breedte van de trap is ongeveer 1,5 meter. Het oppervlak van het verlaagde plafond tot de 11de trede is 2 of meer vierkante meter, wat het mogelijk maakt dat planten op het verlaagde plafond kunnen worden geplaatst als dat plafond is gebouwd als een vloer ondersteund door balken. In de vloer kunnen een of meer beloopbare glasplaten worden aangebracht. Overdag zal licht van buiten en ’s-avonds van lampen in de ruimte tussen het originele plafond en het verlaagde plafond op de trap kunnen vallen. Bovendien kan men planten, bloemen en misschien kunstvoorwerpen zien, welke zijn geplaatst op het verlaagde plafond of aan de muren zijn bevestigd. Het opnieuw ontworpen ‘Haagse Portiek’ zal niet alleen energiebesparing en betere veiligheid verschaffen, maar zou dus ook kunnen dienen als tuin voor planten en bloemen of als tentoonstellingsruimte voor kunstvoorwerpen. Mocht het niet mogelijk zijn een portiek afsluitende deur aan het einde van de trap te plaatsen, omdat er geen voldoende bordesruimte meer zal zijn om op te staan, dan zal het volgende toch gelden. De afsluiting van de warmte isolerende ruimte tussen het originele plafond en het verlaagde plafond middels een raam, dat kan worden geopend, aan het einde van de trap blijft een goede optie om de creatieve aspecten van de warmte isolerende portiekruimte volledig tot uiting te laten komen. N.B. Deze creatieve oplossing kan in principe worden toegepast in iedere ruimte in gebouwen welke in open verbinding staat met de buitenomgeving en waar energie en/of veiligheid een probleem is of wordt.   ©  JowiART Design  JowiART Design focuses on industrial, interior and architectural design.  'Haags Portiek - door'  a creative use of space inspired by Frank Lloyd Wright.  Design of a door in a 'Haags Portiek' in an apartment building in The Hague, The Netherlands designed around 1933 (doorway with stairs to apartments above the ground-floor apartment according 'Nieuwe Haagse School' architecture, 1925 - 1940). Reason for the design of the Haags Portiek - door: improvement of security and saving of energy. A Haags Portiek is a doorway in which a flight of stairs of hard stone leads to a 'bordes' (flat surface at the end of the stairs) which gives access to one or more apartments. The usual Haags Portiek encompasses an enormous space which usually is formed by the front of the building - in many cases provided with one or more large stretched windows with beautiful leaded lights -, the brickwalls of the apartments on de ground-floor and the 1st floor, the stairs, the bordes and the ceiling. In the period of the Nieuwe Haagse School architecture, particularly inspired by the American architect Frank Lloyd Wright, saving of energy was not a 'hot topic' in apartment buildings. Further in Haagse Portieken there is often no light or little light in the evening and at night and these portieken comprise corners where people cannot be seen. Therefore burglary and drugs annoyance is a problem in Haagse Portieken. Nowadays one looks for solutions which will not only result in energy savings in Haagse Portieken, but which at the same time solves the security problems.  JowiART Design made a design in 2007 which saves energy and improves the security in Haagse Portieken in an original and creative way.  This design comprises a lowered ceiling which is connected to a door-frame which is placed on the 12th step. As a dispute has arisen with the authorities on placing the door on the 12th step, an alternative solution has been worked out. This alternative solution comprises the design of a porch on the bordes leaving sufficient surface area on the bordes to stand on in front of the door of the porch. Apparently this turns out to be a requirement according to building rules. In a revised version of the design the lowered ceiling is maintained and extended to connect with the porch. The space between the original ceiling and the lowered ceiling is about 2 metres up to about 1.5 metres from the entrance of the stairs going up, but can be more in other cases. The width of the stairs is about 1.5 metres. The surface area of the lowered ceiling up to the 11th step is 2 or more square meters, which makes it possible that plants can be placed on the lowered ceiling when this ceiling is constructed as a floor supported by beams. In the floor one or more reinforced glass plates on which one can stand can be placed. Light during daytime and light in the evening and at night from lamps in the space between the original ceiling and the lowered ceiling will lighten the stairs.Moreover one can see e.g. plants, flowers or perhaps objects of art which have been placed on the floor of the lowered ceiling or hung on the walls. The redesigned 'Haags Portiek' will not only provide energy savings and better security, but may also serve as a garden for plants and flowers or a show-case for objects of art. In case it would not be possible to place a door for closing the portiek at the end of the stairs, because there will be not enough space on the bordes to stand on, the following will nevertheless apply. The closure of the heat isolating space between the original ceiling and the lowered ceiling by means of a window at the end of the stairs which can be opened, is still a good option to enable the creative aspects of the heat isolating portiek-space to be fully expressed. N.B. This creative solution can in pricipal be applied to any space in buildings which is open to the environment and where energy saving and/or security is or becomes an issue.  ©  JowiART Design ",©

t5_2qh2a,HelenOster,1301809371,"Actually, that isn't necessarily so! All refurbished units sold by Adorama Camera are factory refurbished by the manufacturer, for example, Canon cameras are refurbished at their manufacturing plant in Newport News, VA.; the room that houses Canon’s entire refurb process is said to be completely dust-free, and with every employee working in there being required to wear special booties!  They can have simply been pulled from the production line if something appears faulty, or if it hasn't passed the final inspection. Most of the time it is a very minor issue that needs correcting, nevertheless, once it is pulled from the normal flow of production, it gets flagged as a refurbished model, so you may get a unit straight from the factory that has never been used.  A refurb may also be an ex-store demo, possibly used in field tests or sales displays, or it may have been ordered in error and returned to the retailer (who can't then sell it as 'new' so it has to be sent back to the manufacturer for refurbishment).   All refurbished items will have been checked over by the manufacturer by hand, inspected very thoroughly, diagnosed, and calibrated by experienced technicians, and could therefore turn out to be more dependable than a new item - which will only have been checked by a process of systematic quality control protocol (ie by random sampling as it comes off the conveyor belt).  All Canon refurbished products from Adorama come with a 1 year return-to-Adorama warranty; the warranty we give covers anything the manufacturers warranty covers for a new unit, including shutter defects. All other refurbs sold by Adorama come with a 90-day return-to-manufacturer warranty. In addition, Refurbs come into us with the firmware updates and latest fixes which were carried out at whatever stage it was at when we took delivery.       If you need additional firmware updates you can download them, but for any hardware fixes the unit would have to be sent to Canon.  [By the way, if you send a camera (any camera) to Canon for any hardware work, they will always update the firmware].   As to the individual history of a single item, the honest answer is we have no way of knowing. Refurbished equipment is not like new inventory; the manufacturers contact us when they have a batch to sell, and the availability is unpredictable. However, if you were to ask my personal opinion on whether the equipment that Adorama offers as refurbished is typically less than a year old, based on the regularity with which we receive batches, I'd be inclined to think it is all relatively new.

It was a feminism that saw men as the perpetual perpetrators, women as the perpetual victims and male sexual violence against women as the root of all injustice.  Rape has repeatedly been an instrument of war and, to some feminists, it was beginning to look as if war was an extension of rape.  Geezus bajeebus.  Never, in any feminist literature I have ever read, in no feminist lecture, podcast, interview, whatever, have I found a feminist declaring such a thing!  Where do these people get this idea? Certainly not from feminists. I've said it before and I'll say it again: authors like this are not feminists, and they're not ex-feminists.  It's like when kirk cameron says he used to be an atheist, and tries to debunk atheist arguments, and what he debunks isn't what any atheist on earth actually thinks.  It's just like that.

t5_2qhkd,required3,1301945137,"  From http://www.fairewinds.com/content/who-we-are:  The founder and president of Fairewinds Associates, Inc, Maggie is a freelance paralegal specializing in environmental, nuclear safety, and energy litigation in federal and state administrative law hearings. As a liaison between clients and experts she also conducts technical and legal research, prepares documents for public release and court filings, interviews and retains expert witnesses, drafts motions and legal briefs for client attorneys and prepares legislative testimony and presentations. In addition to conducting technical research and preparing deposition questions, Maggie helps experts prepare reports that are understandable to the average person as well as to judges and juries. Maggie earned her Bachelors Degree in Law and Society from Skidmore College and her Paralegal Certificate with a 4.0 from Burlington College. She was the recipient of the Vermont Paralegal Organization Scholarship 2002-2003. From her experience as a former nuclear industry spokesperson and an engineering assistant in nuclear fuel reload core design for Pressurized Water Reactors (PWR’s), Maggie is well-versed in energy issues, nuclear technology, NRC terminology, and the Code of Federal Regulations. She is adept at explaining these issues to attorneys and legislators in language that is easily understandable by the press, other interested parties, and stakeholders. A newspaper journalist for five years, Maggie works as a free-lance journalist and also blogs on Green Mountain Daily, rated the number one political blog in Vermont. She also appears regularly on local TV and radio to discuss women in media and politics, energy issues, and nuclear safety, reliability and decommissioning issues. Committed to local community service, Maggie serves as a Burlington Public Works Commissioner. She has also served on the Chittenden County State’s Attorney’s Task Force, spent 18 months as a volunteer on one of Burlington’s Restorative Justice Panels, was elected to two 2-year terms on the City’s Community Development Block Grant Board (CDBG). Every year Maggie works on several pro-bono cases involving domestic violence or juvenile justice. Maggie was elected to her second 2-year term as a Justice of the Peace in November 2008 and will be running for re-election as a JP in 2010.  © Copyright 2010, Fairewinds Associates, Inc, All Rights Reserved  Arnie is an energy advisor with 39-years of nuclear power engineering experience. A former nuclear industry senior vice president, he earned his Bachelor's and Master's Degrees in nuclear engineering, holds a nuclear safety patent, and was a licensed reactor operator. During his nuclear industry career, Arnie managed and coordinated projects at 70-nuclear power plants around the country. He currently speaks on television, radio, and at public meetings on the need for a new paradigm in energy production. An independent nuclear engineering and safety expert, Arnie provides testimony on nuclear operations, reliability, safety, and radiation issues to the NRC, Congressional and State Legislatures, and Government Agencies and Officials throughout the US, Canada, and internationally. In 2008, he was appointed by the Vermont Senate President to be the first Chair of the Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Plant Oversight Panel. He has testified in numerous cases and before many different legislative bodies including the Czech Republic Senate. Using knowledge from his Masters Thesis on Cooling Towers, Arnie analyzed and predicted problems with Vermont Yankee’s cooling towers three years prior to their 2007 collapse. His Environmental Court testimony concerned available and economically viable alternatives to cooling towers in order to reduce consumptive water use and the ecological damage caused by cooling tower drift and heated effluents. As the former vice president in an engineering organization, Arnie led the team of engineers who developed the plans for decommissioning Shippingport, the first major nuclear power plant in the US to be fully dismantled. He was also an invited author on the first DOE Decommissioning Handbook. Source term reconstruction is a method of forensic engineering used to calculate radiation releases from various nuclear facilities after nuclear incidents or accidents. Arnie is frequently called upon by public officials, attorneys, and intervenors, to perform source term reconstructions. His source term reconstruction efforts vary. Arnie has calculated exposures to oil workers, who received radiation exposure while working on wells. He has also calculated radiation releases to children with health concerns, who live near a nuclear facility, like the one that carted radioactive sewage off-site and spread it on farmers' fields. Finally, he has performed an accurate source term construction of the radiation releases from the Three Mile Island nuclear accident. Also involved in his local community, Arnie has been a part-time math professor at Community College of Vermont (CCV) since 2007. He also taught high school physics and mathematics for 13 years and was an instructor at RPI's college reactor lab.",©

I did a point by point rebuttal, how is that ignoring what you said? I even gave you my counter-arguments. No I think you are just upset that I did not concede to your superior wisdom. I would like to keep this civil, so suffice it to say if you provide me with a convincing argument then I will probably accept it.  &gt;To dismiss context as ""cultural relativism"" is the height of ignorance.  I am not dismissing context at all. context is perfectly fine. What I have an issue with is you supposing that your context is enough to justify the subsequent actions.  Lets try this quick thought experiment to see if you can understand what I mean. Here is a quote out of context.  ""Nigger, you lazy fuck. I am going to beat you within an inch of your life!""  Now here is the context. It is a rich white plantation owner in the American South just prior to the civil war. The slave in question had only picked 28 bushels of cotton, instead of the 30 bushels his master had commanded him to.During this time period it was perfectly acceptable to beat your slaves if they did not perform up to your standards.  So, would you say ""Of course the man should have beat the lazy slave, its perfectly appropriate for the day and age."" or would you say ""Beating slaves is wrong, the man would should have not beaten his slave, nor owned a slave in the first place.""  If you say the first, then you are a cultural relativist, and it seems to me that is exactly what you are saying about the verses I quoted in the bible.   Yeah, it was OK to make a rule that women had to cover their heads so that no one would mistake them for a whore, regardless of the desires of the women in question. It was OK to tell them to shut up, or that they couldn't be a member of the church or make their own decisions about who they would marry, because of the CONTEXT.  I say fuck that.  &gt;and particularly entertaining, as atheists, by logical extension, must necessarily be nihilists [even if they don't live that way, because they themselves are logically inconsistent.  Nice, just throw out a completely fallacious statement that could be a topic all its own and has no relation to the topic at hand. But alright, ill bite. I say that this statement is false. You made the claim, now the burden of proof is on you.  &gt;The fact of the matter is there is nothing wrong with telling women to be quiet in church. If the men were being disruptive, like the women were being, Paul would have told the men to zip their lips.  This is complete bullshit and if you don't know it I feel sorry for you. That is a powerful self-delusion you have there.  Again, if he had meant ""Ladies, please don't interrupt while the men are spouting off their nonsense."" THAT IS WHAT HE WOULD HAVE FUCKING SAID!!! But he didn't tell them not to interrupt. He said  that the very act of a woman even daring to speak AT ALL in a church is SHAMEFUL! God damn man can you cats twist anything that makes you look bad around. You should be a spin doctor for John McCain or some shit.  &gt;Likewise, it's hilarious that you keep harping on an old King James translation to inform your position, as King James is the worst translation available, itself being a translation of a translation. Essentially, it's the Xerox of the bible world. I myself prefer something with a bit more resolution.  Oh great and noble scholar of the bible. Please, please let me and the rest of the unwashed, unworthy masses know what the name of this great and Hi-rez translation of the holy word might be! So that we may gain the proper insight into the words of the great and almighty God!  I have no particular affinity for KJV myself, in fact, I think its pretty stupid. But lets see how some *other* popular translations renders one of these passages and see if they are any less heinous.  *1 Timothy 2:11-15 (New International Version, ©2011)   11 A woman[a] should learn in quietness and full submission. 12 I do not permit a woman to teach or to assume authority over a man;[b] she must be quiet. 13 For Adam was formed first, then Eve. 14 And Adam was not the one deceived; it was the woman who was deceived and became a sinner. 15 But women[c] will be saved through childbearing—if they continue in faith, love and holiness with propriety.*  Nope, not any better.  *1 Timothy 2:11-15 (New American Standard Bible)   11(A)A woman must quietly receive instruction with entire submissiveness.   12(B)But I do not allow a woman to teach or exercise authority over a man, but to remain quiet.   13(C)For it was Adam who was first created, and then Eve.   14And it was not Adam who was deceived, but (D)the woman being deceived, fell into transgression.   15But women will be preserved through the bearing of children if they continue in (E)faith and love and sanctity with self-restraint.*  Nope, still repugnant.  *1 Timothy 2:11-15 (Young's Literal Translation)   11Let a woman in quietness learn in all subjection,   12and a woman I do not suffer to teach, nor to rule a husband, but to be in quietness,   13for Adam was first formed, then Eve,   14and Adam was not deceived, but the woman, having been deceived, into transgression came,   15and she shall be saved through the child-bearing, if they remain in faith, and love, and sanctification, with sobriety.*  Literal huh?  I will exceed my word count if I keep going. I will just wait until the translation you prescribe is revealed. I am sure you will have them burning their bras and voting in your ver.  &gt;Lemme guess. You got these passages from an Atheistic list that was designed to show how to the Bible is sexist and terrible, right? You've never even read the epistles in their entirely, let alone studied the geography or history of the regions.  Fail on all counts, but thanks for playing.  &gt;Yeah, that's why no one is taking what you said seriously, and why I won't either.  Ah, well I am glad you have wasted both our time then. I guess I am the one who got trolled eh? Hell man, you haven't' even tried a rebuttal of anything I said. You have nothing.

t5_2qh13,mosmiley,1302088821,"&gt;Every source from the period (not European in origin) says he engaged her when she was 6 years old. The only dispute is whether he married and consummated when she was 9 years old or 10 years old. In other words, pedophile.  Nope, wrong. I have never believed that myth because of the obvious unreliability and bias of sources, YET an overwhelming MOTIVE to spread the myth. There are sources that contradict ""every source"" and some of the supposed sources contradict themselves. [here's a paper that presents a logical rebuttal](http://www.studying-islam.org/articletext.aspx?id=935). Haha yes the European crusaders would never have a reason to slander Mohammedans, I mean whoops Muslims.  Oh wait….they still are.  &gt;I don't think that. I have been saying non-stop that Islam does not let you leave it, or criticize it. If I lived in a Muslim country, I could not freely express the thoughts I expressed here without fear for my life.  Oh? If not, how come you have to spread ignorance, lies and hate about Islam as well? Are you unable to argue a point without strawmanning? If youre not fearful, you seem to have quite a bit of hate for Islam for which, I'm still not sure of your motive in spreading your bullshit and lies.   Anyway, regarding blaspehmy  The Qur'an[86] advises Muslims to shun those who find fault with God: 	▪	""...when ye hear the signs of Allah held in defiance and ridicule, ye are not to sit with them unless they turn to a different theme: if ye did, ye would be like them. For Allah will collect the hypocrites and those who defy faith - all in Hell:-""[87] 	▪	""Hold to forgiveness; command what is right; But turn away from the ignorant.""[88] 	▪	""...but indeed they uttered blasphemy,...If they repent, it will be best for them; but if they turn back (to their evil ways), Allah will punish them...""[89] 	▪	""For Allah is with those who restrain themselves,...""[90] 	▪	""Therefore be patient with what they say, and celebrate (constantly) the praises of thy Lord, before the rising of the sun, and before its setting; yea, celebrate them for part of the hours of the night, and at the sides of the day: that thou mayest have (spiritual) joy.""[91] 	▪	""And the servants of (Allah) Most Gracious are those who walk on the earth in humility, and when the ignorant address them, they say, ""Peace!"";""[92] 	▪	""And when they hear vain talk, they turn away therefrom and say: ""To us our deeds, and to you yours; peace be to you: we seek not the ignorant.""""[93] 	▪	""And have patience with what they say, and leave them with noble (dignity).""[94] 	▪	""Tell those who believe, to forgive those who do not look forward to the Days of Allah: It is for Him to recompense (for good or ill) each People according to what they have earned.""[95] 	▪	""Bear, then, with patience, all that they say, and celebrate the praises of thy Lord, before the rising of the sun and before (its) setting.""[96]  The Qur'an speaks of punishment in relation only to those who make war and mischief in opposition to God and Muhammad:  ""The punishment of those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger, and strive with might and main for mischief through the land is: execution, or crucifixion, or the cutting off of hands and feet from opposite sides, or exile from the land:             that is their disgrace in this world, and a heavy punishment is theirs in the Hereafter;""  —Qur'an, sura 5 (Al-Ma'ida), ayah 33  Regarding apostasy....  S. A. Rahman, a former Chief Justice of Pakistan, argues that there is no indication of the death penalty for apostasy in the Qur'an.[58] W. Heffening states that in Qur'an ""the apostate is threatened with punishment in the next world only,"" adding that Shafi'is interpret verse [Qur'an 2:217] as adducing the main evidence for the death penalty in the Qur'an.[59] Wael Hallaq holds that ""nothing in the law governing apostate and apostasy derives from the letter of the holy text.""[5] The late dissenting Shia jurist Grand Ayatollah Hossein-Ali Montazeri, a significant Shi'a religious authority, stated that the Quranic verses do not prescribe an earthly penalty for apostasy.[51] Popular Islamist author Sayyid Abul Ala Maududi argued that verses [Qur'an 9:11] of the Qur'an sanction death for apostasy. However, some scholars reject Mawdudi's interpretation. S. A. Rahman concluded ""that not only is there no punishment for apostasy provided in the Book but that the Word of God clearly envisages the natural death of the apostate. He will be punished only in the Hereafter…""[60] He continues and says that there is no reference to the death penalty in any of the 20 instances of apostasy mentioned in the Qur'an. In his book on Punishment of Apostasy in Islam, Rahman declares the verse [Qur'an 2:256] which contains the explicit language, ""Let there be no compulsion in religion..."", to be ""one of the most important verses of the Qur'an, containing a charter of freedom of conscience unparalleled in the religious annals of mankind…"". He goes on to criticize the attempts by Muslim scholars over the ages to narrow its broad humanistic meaning and impose limits on its scope in their attempts to reconcile it with their interpretations of Muhammad's Sunna.  You definitely have a point about the lack of protection for the freedom of expression and I wouldn't disagree. But that is a political and culture issue exacerbated by the extremism. All I'm saying is the actual religion condemns everything these extremists do. This is definitely an issue. Most of the stories I've read seem to be provocative slander (like the cartoon) or blasphemy, but that in no way justifies any sort of violence. God himself says in the Quran to leave punishment to him several times.    &gt;The murder of 12 UN workers after the burning of the Quran has nothing to do with US occupation or attacks. It has to do with them being religious fanatics and fucking lunatics. Nor do the many other attacks on non-Muslims in Muslim countries have anything to do with US occupation. Why should Coptic Christians be murdered in Egypt? Why have the few Catholics in Iraq been butchered and forced out of the country? Why is leaving Islam punishable by death in Afghanistan and Pakistan? Why was a politician who spoke up against an anti-blasphemy law murdered? Why was the only non-Muslim MP in Pakistan murdered? None of this has anything to do with so-called US/Jewish oppression.  Of course not, obviously. It just sounded like you have a misguided fear of Islam. This was written more as a general analysis into why it may appear as Muslims would be more violent when really its usually desperation (suicide bombers are a good example). Another poster noted that social and economic conditions that are leading to the extremism, most due to oppression from the western world.  &gt; It has to do with them being religious fanatics and fucking lunatics. So why can't you leave it at that? Why do you have to defame Islam?  &gt;There's so much wrong with this comment I don't know where to start. There is no ""Christian Empire."" And no, I don't think Christians (or anyone sane) ""get off"" on this stuff. If you want to see people getting off, go watch the video of Daniel Pearl being decapitated.  Yes actually I would like to clarify that statement because that was expressed poorly. The point I was trying to make is that there are extremists in every religion. The US is of course secular, but many consider it a ""Christian nation"" and I could argue that the evangelical Christian right are extremists in their fervent support of Israel and of course, in the general oppression of the Muslim world. Two occupations, two more countries being bombed, Muslims facing discrimination in the US and Europe and the intentional colonization and weakening of any sort of unified Muslim empire. It can be framed as a war on Islam by Christianity and these extremists thrive on that belief. This combined with ignorance, tribal culture and lack of basic human rights/protections leads to disgusting acts by extremist Muslims.  Are you American btw?",▪

t5_2r65t,Inverted_Inversion,1302096216,"Here is the tale of the Button-down Polo collar [straight from Brook Brothers](http://www.brooksbrothers.com/timelessclassics/dressshirts.tem):  &gt;The story of the original Polo® Button-Down dates to the late 1800s. While on a European buying trip, John E. Brooks, the grandson of our founder, observed that polo players had cleverly anchored their collars to their collars to their shirts by means of buttons, thus keeping their collars from flying into their faces during gameplay. Inspired by what he saw, he came back to Brooks and introduced the original Polo Button-Down to America that same year.   It may be a nearly ubiquitous element on shirts for over 100 years, but I still think it looks out of place indoors. And, while it may not be the fault of the shirt itself, per se, I most often see the button-down worn by the same folks who are wearing a worn out pair of pleated Dockers with black belt and brown shoes. Button down collars at the office, *in my perception*, are the uniform of the fashion handicapped.  The one plus I will give to the button down is that when worn without a tie, they give an element of structure that most collars lose with that top button undone. Nothing looks quite as sloppy as when a tie gets taken off and the collars fly away to one's shoulders.  It seems we mostly agree except on the finer points. Which is, I guess, what makes fashion fun.  ",®

t5_2qpp6,Slust,1302119097,"A Redditor after my own heart.  There is so much tunnel-vision with StarCraft 2.  It is easy to see why, there is a lot of passion that flows through the community and that's a good thing.  That's a really good thing.  But the problem is we've become the ADHD Generation; we need instant gratification and we need it *now*!  For one example, look back at EverQuest - you could literally go months without upgrading a single piece of gear.  And that was accepted, that was the norm.  Fast forward to World of Warcraft - you could literally replace your entire set of gear, possibly even multiple times, within a span of months.  And every game is emulating that style of fast and easy rewards, because it's a formula proven to work with the user base, they really like that they can damn near see and equip everything.  The accessibility is now about constant stimulation and constant feeling good.  Even with Reddit stimulus is rapid fire.  If you're ever bored, spend a minute on Reddit.  You'll find something new and stimulating.  When you're bored of that, you're seconds away from finding a new, stimulating topic.  Bored of that?  What's next?  And so on and so forth.  This is just how we've become.  We fixate on the *right now* and through that, we lose perspective and sight of the bigger picture.  We also lose reason.  And that's why I make gigantic, verbose posts.  It bugs me because I can't help but feel that, as the community, we're ""doing it wrong"".  I think that the greatest thing that can happen to StarCraft 2 is the community stops sperging about game balance, and instead, critically analyze games and situations where the player might have messed up and what they could have done differently and then try it.  And try it multiple times, we need to iterate the possibilities and examine them so we can figure out how to use all of the tools at our disposal.  The ideal StarCraft game, as I see it, is like a game of tennis.  The players would have to constantly look at what their opponent is doing and react to it to stop them before they do it.  This constant back and forth ""You're doing this, huh?  Alright, I'll change what I'm doing to stop that...  Oh, you caught on and are going this other route to counter me?  Alright, I'll start going this route to counter that...""  And it's back and forth, back and forth; one player positions himself to gain the upper hand, then the opposing player moves to stop that and then gain the upper hand and in the process both players get into that ""can build everything"" situation because they've lived long enough to unlock all the tech and at that point the game becomes about who can win the decisive battle.  As it is now, that is the very significant minority.  A lot of games end to timing attacks.  And those timing attacks, and the race/units involved in them, are being called OP.  So now we have the community crying about how Roach/Hydra isn't good enough against X, instead of realizing that Ling/Bling would have been a better counter.  And it is that mentality that, I feel, is really holding the StarCraft 2 community back.  That is what is preventing us from evolving as fast as we could to get to the point where literally the game design changes are the only changes that can effect the balance of the game.  Because that is the best case scenario.  It shouldn't be the only case scenario, but it is the best case scenario.  Making minor tweaks, like adding time to construction/research/duration/etc will help keep the design intent in tact, as well as make as little detriment to the existing balance as possible.  It's when you make major changes, like putting Hydras as a tier 1 unit, that you really threaten to destroy the ecosystem, so to speak.  Because then you're introducing a hell of a lot more unknowns that the players need to re-figure out.  **TL;DR YET AGAIN** (I only write novels because I really care, I promise.  ♥)  And so, we (finally) arrive back at my original point - as a community we need to stop with the QQ and make with the more Pew Pew.  Crying and discussing nonexistent hypothetical situations is not as productive as analyzing and coming up with actual material practices.  It is once we run out of those material practices to counter something that we evaluate game design changes for balance.  That's how Blizzard treats it, that's how we should start treating it too.",♥

t5_2qh2p,OriginalEnough,1302126074,"Not quite right. You've grasped relativity too firmly and are trying to apply it to everything.  'North' and 'South' are relative to the Earth. If I were sober, I would be able to explain it more eloquently, but direction (on the Earth's surface) is a vector quantity. It is made up of North/South and East/West. East/West seems to be more of a relative quantity than North/South because there are no *real* East and West poles. (The Greenwich Meridian and its counterpart may count, but only based on tradition.) It would be possible to say that someone is 190° East of you and for that to be correct.  When it comes to North and South, there are absolute poles that we determine our position by. When you are precisely at the North pole (I know it's next to impossible, but bear with me) you cannot go any further North, because you would then be heading South.  Using your example, both **B** and **A** would be South of the North pole, but **B** would be in the same direction as North to **A**, along the surface of the Earth.  In other words, you're right that:  **✈B**  ↑  ○ North Pole  ↑  **A** in New York  but only if ↑ is defined as a relative direction, not as an absolute such as 'North'.  I hope this helps.

t5_2qhkh,acpawlek,1302144727," A close reading of the literature suggests the manufacturer’s assumptions that glyphosate is “completely safe for the environment” is an overstatement.  For instance, on January 10, 1997, after receiving complaints from the New York Attorney General’s Office, Monsanto agreed to remove its advertisements portraying the herbicide as “environmentally friendly” and “biodegradable”. 4  The Attorney General’s Office disapproved of the advertisements on grounds that they inaccurately implied that Roundup® is as safe as the active ingredient, glyphosate.  As the Attorney General pointed out, the product contains ingredients with toxicity greater than glyphosate alone. Glyphosate is very stable in the environment. The chemical binds to many soil types and clay materials, making it immobile in many soils. Because glyphosate binds so tightly to soils, it can move into groundwater when the soil particles are washed into streams or rivers.  Its binding to soil particles is also responsible for inhibiting soil microorganisms.   High levels of glyphosate are known to inhibit soil respiration after ten weeks of chronic exposure. 5 Glyphosate has been detected in run-off four months after application and in stream sediment 19 months after application.   Although molecules of glyphosate tightly bond to organic matter and sandy soils, glyphosate can remain active in the environment. Glyphosate is manufactured to be used in aquatic weed programs.  However its safety has been questioned. If glyphosate is maintained at very low doses, significant genetic damage occurs in tadpoles if exposed to labeled levels for more than 24 hours. 6 Fungal species are important to the cycling of nutrients.  Fungi break down dead plant tissue and allow root systems to then take up the available nutrients.  While glyphosate usually did not exert any effect on the total count of soil fungi, it did alter sub-soil fungal organisms after testing periods lasting six to ten weeks.  Two strains of fungi showed population increases after treatment with Roundup®, while one strain, Penicillum funiculosum, was completely eliminated by a high treatment level. ",®

t5_2qhk3,Fathers4Justice,1302214058,"Fathers-4-Justice® USA Roadmap for Family Law Equality   Mission: That there may be Truth Justice and total Equality in Family Law in every family court in the United States and that every court judge, legislator and public servant be fully accountable to the people for which they have been elected, appointed or hired to serve.   General Fatherhood Issues Fathers-4-Justice® hereby demands that: 1.	The Governor of EVERY state issue a proclamation declaring that both parents are equally important in the raising and care of their children. 2.	The Federal government commission a study of the family courts systems in the United States to evaluate their impact on parents and children after divorce or separation and particularly the negative impact of courts have regarding the relationships of fathers and there children and the resulting impact on our children. 3.	Each state fund a commission to enable the production of Public Service Announcements and brochures designed to promote education and policies which would bring both parents and their children closer together.   Family Law Fathers-4-Justice® demands that: 1.	It should be each state’s public policy that it is in the public interest as well as the best interest of children and families to encourage parents to share the rights and responsibility of child rearing. To this end Fathers-4-Justice® insists that each state enact legislation stating that a rebuttable presumption of 50/50 joint physical and legal custody be the starting point custody disputes for fit parents where this is desired by at least one parent AND that such an arrangement should be supported and encouraged. Parenting time should be ""maximized"". The parties should anticipate, that those administering or supervising domestic cases (i.e., family court) will make every effort to maximize the time parents have with their children to avoid rendering either of the parties a loser in the action, and to maximize the likelihood that children will have both natural parents involved in a meaningful way. Children want, love, and need two parents. 2.	It should be each state’s public policy that frequent and continuing contact between minor children and both parents, if the parents have separated or dissolved their marriage, is presumed to be beneficial to the children for all fit parents. 3.	All states must modify its policy of enforcing only the monetary support portion of family court decrees to include equally stringent enforcement of parenting time portions of those decrees. 4.	“Move away” laws should be enacted in every state that prohibit a parent from moving the Child(ren) a substantial distance from the other parent without the written agreement of the other parent to assure a meaningful relationship is maintained with the non-moving parent and that a stable living environment may continue for the child(ren). 5.	Each state enact gender neutral Domestic Kidnapping laws that make it a crime with severe mandatory penalties for either parent to move and hide the identity and location of a child from the other parent. In addition each state must have reciprocal enforcement agreements with all other states. 6.	Every state and the federal government protect our military and civilian men and women from domestic court proceedings taking place while they are away on active duty or required to be temporary relocated and unable to appear or contest such proceedings. This protection should include but not be limited to establishing or changing support orders, custody issues, moving the children and divorce proceedings. 7.	Family Bill of Rights 1.	Must be established at a federal level 2.	A family bill of rights must be provided to each parent when married or when a motion for divorce, custody or child support is filed or served. 8.	That every family court and judges be required to publish and have available to the public detailed statistics regarding custody requests made and decisions rendered. 9.	That every family court be open to the public and media without exception.   Domestic Violence Fathers-4 Justice® hereby demands that: 1.	Judges, prosecutors and other court personnel should attend educational conferences on domestic violence (DV) structured to avoid the present gender bias that ignores or discounts domestic violence by women against both men and children. 2.	Properly trained Case Evaluators should screen each domestic violence case with the goal of arriving at mutually agreeable solutions in an atmosphere of communication and compromise. 3.	Evidentiary standards and procedures should be reviewed and revised by in domestic violence cases and such standards and procedures should be revised whenever gender biasness is found and that this review should be done on a continuous bases by a gender neutral state funded committee. 4.	Each state’s application for state and VAWA funding be reviewed by the Attorney General to determine the extent to which the application of such funds have been illegally denied funding and to determine the extent to which the services provided meet the gender neutral requirements of the Violence Against Women Act. 5.	False allegations of domestic violence, child abuse and sexual abuse should be made a criminal offence with severe but appropriate mandatory sentencing.   Child Support Fathers-4 Justice® hereby demands that: 1.	States should finance a Commission to conduct a detailed study of the root causes of the child support arrearages and make recommendations of new methods to reduce arrearages without having to resort to incarceration and other methods that would not limit the income or parenting time of the obligor. 2.	Child support should be based on the basic costs of supporting a child (food, clothing and housing) and should not include “disguised alimony”. 3.	Child support should terminate at age 18 or upon graduation from High school which ever comes last. 4.	No parent should be required to fund a child’s college education. 5.	Child support must consider the costs associated with supporting the children in BOTH the mother’s and father’s households. Support must follow the child.   Paternity Fraud and Certificates of Birth 1.	Paternity fraud should be made a criminal offense with mandatory penalties. 2.	Child support paid in fraudulent pretexts’ should be recoverable by the obligor with no statute of limitations. 3.	DNA testing at birth should be mandatory for unmarried, married or divorcing couples PRIOR to establishing paternity. ",®

t5_2qi58,valleyshrew,1302284151,"Is it unprecedented for the top scorer and top assister to neither be one of the 7 nominees? I would take berbatov, van der sar or nani over vidic. Yes vidic is great but he also makes some big mistakes and gets sent off a lot. I also prefer Ferdinand when he's fit. Much better at passing, better at tackling and more composure. Vidic is only good for winning near every header, which is great, but people in England over-rate hard men and under-rate skillful players like modric &amp; berbatov.   I pretty much would have a completely seperate list than this. Nasri and Bale haven't impressed since near the start of the season. Adam and Parker are in the relegation zone and are probably slightly over-rated as people love an underdog. Nolan and Holden have been better imo, but because they're in middling teams they don't get much attention or bonus points.   A good way to judge would be too see who's gotten the most bonus points in the fantasy league. You can keep a clean sheet and play poorly, or you can score a hat trick and not be man of the match (kuyt and rooney recently). Bonus points are a more intelligently judged factor. Though they will over-reward players for worse teams and inconsistent players.   I tediously recorded the top fantasy bonus points scorers:  Hart - 4  Cech - 2  Foster - 8  ----  Baines - 12  A Cole - 11  Vidic - 7  Huth - 12  ---  Nani - 23  Adam - 43  Dempsey - 19  Malouda - 16  Nolan - 16  Downing - 12  Arshavin - 8  Van der vaart - 16  A Young - 19  Kuyt - 8  Yaya Toure - 13  ---  Tevez - 29  Berbatov - 25  Drogba - 19  Elmander - 17  Rooney - 16  Bent - 11  Odemwingie - 21  ----  Nominees not in top 25 points: Nasri - 19, Parker - 25, Bale - 13. Parker gets a very high percentage of his points from bonuses which is good as he doesn't score/assist or keep clean sheets much, and it's tough playing for West Ham.  Based on this the nominees should be: **Adam, Tevez, Berbatov, Parker, Nani, Dempsey, Young.** That's a much more agreeable list. Adam's total is obviously extreme because blackpool are so poor he stands out more, while it's hard for a player in a top team to stand out so much. Bale is probably the least deserving. No goals or assists in spurs last 9 games. Only 10 goals+assists in total. I don't see how anyone could argue Bale should win, *except* for the fact that perhaps it's not his fault he isn't the leading assister given how horrendous Spurs forwards are at converting the myriad chances he lays on a plate for them. That's the problem with result oriented data. You should only use it as an assist to your experience of watching all the games. But who watches all the games? We're biased towards who makes the highlights on match of the day.  Goals+assists chart (✔=nominated):  Tevez 25✔  Luis Nani 25  Berbatov 23  Rooney 21  Drogba 20  Carroll 17  Van der Vaart 17✔  Andrey Arshavin 17  Van Persie 16  Elmander 16  Odemwingie 16  Adam 16✔  Bent 15  Chris Brunt 15  Nolan 14  Stewart Downing 14  Leighton Baines 14  Francesc Fabregas 13  Dempsey 13  Cahill 13  Hernandez 12  Matthew Etherington 11  Nasri 10 ✔  Bale 10✔  Peter Crouch 9  Parker 8✔  Vidic 5✔  You can see Nasri and Bale are the outliers there. 2 attacking players that are not in the top 20 goals+assists. Vidic and Parker aren't attacking players so they're understandably far down.  What about Actim stats? They're a good measure of overall performance and not just attacking play:  **Berbatov, Malouda, Tevez, Vidic, Rooney, Nolan, Nani** are the top 7 from there.  Tevez - 3rd, Vidic - 4th, Bale - 14th, Nasri - 20th, Parker - 33rd, Adam - 40th, Van der Vaart - 52nd  Bale is the only one that really annoys me. You can't count his 6 goal/assists in Europe for this award afaik and it's clear people are doing that.  After all that data, and going by my own experience of watching games, my top 7 is, in order:  **Tevez, Adam, Nani, Berbatov, Vidic, Baines, Holden**  If Tevez or Adam doesn't win, it's a disgrace. Maybe I contradict myself by placing Adam 2nd when I earlier said Nolan and Holden are better, but the data has changed my mind. I don't watch blackpool enough to have judged him fairly and it would maybe be nice for a player of the year to not come from the top sides for once. The only possible reason I can come up with for Nani and Berbatov's perplexing absence is that they've been dropped for their club lately. Berbatov is 3rd choice striker, and Nani is competing with valencia/park/giggs for a starting position. But the real reason Nani isn't nominated (despite being 1st goals/assists, 7th in actim stats &amp; 1st in fantasy league points) is because of his repuation. Journalists have admitted as much. His reputation is completely undeserved. It's just a bandwagon of hate towards him. I have seen Rooney and Giggs dive more than Nani this season. What Nani does isn't dive, but exaggerate injury. That's not a big deal compared to other things players do. Anytime the referee has a decision to make (throw in, corner, penalty, etc.), both teams players will try claim it as their own even when they clearly often know they are lieing. It's clear English football fans look down upon ""soft"" players and overrate ""tough"" ones. That's why Vidic gets in ahead of Nani despite not deserving to.   A bit of anti-united bias is probably there too (unless you can only nominate 1 per team?) as they're the team everyone loves to hate. 3 out of 4 of the top goals/assists are united players, and none of them are nominated. It's also ridiculous to do this in March. Last year if it had been done at the end, Drogba would have won. By the end of this year I reckon it's quite possible Rooney, Berbatov, Nani and Hernandez will be 4 of the top 7 players.  Hopefully this post has been informative. The fact I'm a United fan and think Tevez should win it (despite hating the little bastard) should dissuade you ABUs from downvoting me.",✔

t5_2sd1g,tesseraktik,1302292731,"Det finns mycket med Borg som är intressant och roligt att ha som tema: ---- Assimilering - Passar jättebra in i mottagningen.  Kollektivt medvetande - Spexigt; kan ha mycket kul med det.  Redundans - Nostalgi ♥  ----  Dock finns det en aspekt som definierat dem mer än någonting annat, och som enligt mig är episkt roligt: Retroaktiv kontinuitet http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetCon  ----  Jag menar, titta bara på dem (SPOIL0RZ): ----  * Första tecknen på the Borg syntes i ST:TNG S1E26, ""The Neutral Zone"": Året är 2364, och en massa Federationsutposter längs gränsen till The Neutral Zone har förintats av the Borg.   - ...men när avsnittet skrevs var tanken att det var en ras av insekter som låg bakom det hela, men cyborger visade sig vara mer budgetvänliga. Det producerades två avsnitt som handlade om neurala parasiter som infiltrerat Federationen, och det slutade med en cliffhanger som antydde att fler var på väg...  ...men de kom aldrig. Det var tanken att man skulle etablera ett samband mellan the Borg och de neurala parasiterna, men se'n gick manusförfattarna ut i strejk, så det blev inte så.  * När the Borg först syntes i ST:TNG S2E16, ""Q Who"" (som utspelade sig 2365) tyckte de att andra organismer var helt ointresserade: Allt de ville var att ta andra's teknologi, och ordet ""assimilated"" förekom inte ens (eller ordet ""futile"", för den delen). Nästa gång man såg dem (ST:TNG S3E26, ""The Best of Both Worlds"", år 2366) ville de assimilera människosläktet, och sedan dess har assimilation varit deras grej.  * Det finns ingenting som påminner om en ledare i Borg-kollektivet. Eller, ja, det trodde man i alla fall fram till det att ""Star Trek VIII: First Contact"" kom ut. Året var 2373...  ...men så åkte de tillbaka till år 2063, och där träffade man the Borg Queen. Det var oklart vad hon hade för roll i kollektivet, och många såg henne som ett förkroppsligande av kollektivet snarare än en egen individ...  ...men den teorin sket sig rätt mycket i alla avsnitt hon var med i i ""Star Trek: Voyager"".  * Okej, så tekniskt sett träffade väl människan på the Borg för första gången år 2063...  ...men de DOKUMENTERADES först år 2366, eller hur? FEL! I ""Star Trek: Voyager""-avsnittet ""Scorpion"" får vi lära oss att Starfleet öppnade en fil om the Borg år 2293, efter att man retcon:at El Aurian-rasen's öde så att de hamnade i vårt solsystem det året på ett sätt som tillät William Shatner att vara med i en till film, och man fick senare lära sig att två forskare träffade på en Borg-kub år 2354, men det var det ingen som visste förr än senare.  * ...och i ST:E-avsnittet ""Regeneration"" - släppt 14 år efter Q Who visade det sig att the United Earth Starfleet träffade på några Borg-drönare från framtiden år 2153.  ...och naturligtvis är det en massa andra detaljer som ändrats lite hit och dit, typ formatet på deras namn och en massa annat. ----- Ja, hursomhelst: Retroaktiv kontinuitet är kul! We should have us some of that!  Jag föreslår att vi byter tema lite då och låtsas att vi alltid haft ett och samma tema. Jag kan se framför mig hur några drönare håller tal vid varje fest där meningen ""Kom ihåg: The Borg's första prioritet är, och har alltid varit, [vad det än är just då]."" ---- THOUGHTS? YOUR THOUGHTS WILL BE ADDED TO OUR OWN! RESISTANCE IS FUTILE!",♥

t5_2qhx4,Filipp0,1302545075,"I don't know how to edit the first post, so I'll just give some more info here:  -I gained most weight during my first year (about 40lbs, 25-30 in the first 6 months) -Back then, I had no idea about how to train and eat properly. I just knew I had to gain weight and I started to eat literally 3x as much food as I did before. I actually drank as many water as I could as well, just increase my stomach's capacity for food during meals (needless to say that's NOT what I do today) -Never used any steroids, though I'm not against it. If one wants to use them and is aware of the risks, why not?  I'm hoping to gain 10-15lbs in the next 4 months. Hopefully I'll follow up with an improved version of myself by end of July.  By the way, I'm 195cm (6'5""), when I joined a gym (2001) I weighted 70Kg (154 lbs). Today I'm at 95Kg (209 lbs).  EDIT:  Ok, more info:     ☑ Diet/calorie intake     I have no idea. I know that I didn't eat enough and started eating too much - but too much of the wrong stuff. I eat crazy amounts of carbs (my dinner was usually 2.5 lbs of pasta). As time went by I learned about diet, and started having meals more often, less quantity and more protein-focused. Never measured calorie intake though.  Today I try to eat 6-7 meals/day:  Breakfest: Cereal + soy milk and a toast or two with light ricota cheese  Morning snack: either a protein bar, a shake (like MuscleMilk) or a fruit, depends on what's available in the office  Lunch: Usually chicken breast and pasta  Afternoon snack (x2): a sandwich, protein bar or shake, again, depending on what's available  After workout: just whey protein (I should start having some dextrose or something as well)  Dinner: depends on the time, but I try to eat low carbs and more protein (like a fish of chicken breast). If it's very late, just a protein shake  ☑ Length of transformation      From 2002 to 2003 I gained most weight - was my first year in college, so I had time and energy. From then on I've improved (net), but had several ups and downs.. working 60h+/week doesn't help  ☑ Age  16 in the first pictures, 26 now  ☑ History/summary of transformation/reasons for change      I was tired of being skinny - when you're this tall it looks very weird. Gaining weight really changed my life, got a huge self-confidence boost during college and today I feel much better about myself  ☑ Tips/tricks that worked for you      I try to vary my exercise and diet so I don't get bored. I learned that consistency &gt;&gt; short term boosts of crazy dieting/working out  ☑ Medical issues/considerations      I've injured myself (especially my shoulders) working out too hard. There are other ways to stress your muscles, if you think you're pushing yourself too hard and might get hurt, try changning your routine, during different exercises, dropsets etc.  ☑ Anaerobic routine      I have tried pretty much every routine out there. What has helped me the most was:  -Never stick to the same routine for a long time -Diving into at least 3 routines (ideally I would do 5, but because of work I can't be sure I'll always go to the gym).   Right now I'm doing: Back, biceps and traps / Legs, calfs and abs / Chest, triceps and shoulders. Abs every other day.  ☑ Aerobic routine  I absolutely HATE doing cardio in the gym. Treadmill = torture. But I know that's not healthy, so I just try to engage in sports whenever I can. There's always a group of people willing to play soccer/volleyball/whatever you like once a week or so  ☑ Supplementation  Today: whey protein after my work outs, Jack3D and Ribose pre-work out (though I think pure creatin is better). Eventual protein shake here and there",☑

t5_2qh03,Crackensan,1302583140,"I actually started with Final Fantasy 7 PC Version.  I adored it, and wondered what other games in the series had in-store.  I didn't get around to playing the earlier games until after 8, which I had a PS1 for. ♥ Birthdays.  Regardless, I went back and played, in this order, 5, 4, 1, and 6 (couldn't find ROMs for 2, 3 that were translated.); to this DAY I feel 6 (3 US) is the strongest in the series.  8's unique with it's leveling system and use of the idea that you don't use magic, you use it to buff yourself.  The refining magic from items is cool, and abusing the GF's as shields and using magic to make yourself powerful is innovative.  That doesn't help that the rest of the game was sub par.  Convoluted, weird, teen emo story wasn't bad... just... well, when you compare it to 6, you kinda see where I start really disliking 8's story.   Now, 8 had it's moments.  The Dollet Landing, the Garden Air Battle, all cool moments.  The Squall/Rinoa thing on the Ragnorok was neat, and heartfelt.  6 just had better ones.  Not once really in JRPG's had a character before contemplated suicide, or really seen a villain so morally deprived as to kill an entire town.  Yes, the town harbored ""Rebels"", but why the women and children as well?  Or had a compelling, on-going long lost love story that, in the end, despite his efforts, was never meant to end his way.  And even though it didn't, you empathized with him, and understood his journey.  Social issues of experimentation on sentient beings (Espers, Terra herself, Kefka himself.) and the ramifications; these issues 6 touched on beautifully in the context of it's world.  Now, don't get me wrong, 8 is a solid title.  But compared to 6, it doesn't hold a candle.  Even 7, the break out title here in the west for Final Fantasy, is still not as good as 6 was; and let me be clear: 7 is a DAMN FINE GAME. ",♥

I actually downloaded an iPhone app (I believe it was called ""Lose It!"" or something like that) and tracked my calories everyday. For the first week, I noticed I was well over 2,500 calories a day and had little to no physical exercise. Other than walking to class and back, I was on my ass all day.  I started lowering my intake gradually. Every couple of weeks I'd drop another 250 calories. By November, I was eating around 1,200 calories a day and running 3 miles everyday. Weird thing was, I didn't really see the results I was expecting. I was dropping weight, but nothing too substantial. Then BAM! Come December, I weighed myself and was at 165 lbs and could really notice a difference in the mirror. After that, the fat that remained around the longest was around my mid section and upper arms (which is mostly long gone now).  ☑ Length of transformation   Early October 2010-Late March 2011 (7 months)  ☑ Age  First photo: 20   Second photo: 21   ☑ History/summary of transformation/reasons for change   I've been quite overweight for most of my life. I never really was into sports (I played intramural basketball when I was in 5th grade... the last time I've ever been affiliated with some sort of sport). I had very little exercise all through grade school. Since entering college, I thought maybe I'd be able to take hold of the whole ""working-out"" thing that most college students I knew started. Sadly, not at first.  It was when I started renting my first apartment and had to buy groceries for myself is when I really noticed my ""fattening"" tendencies. I bought disgusting (well, I now see that way) food all of the time; pizza pockets, candy, cheetoes, mountain dew, etc. So, I basically just went to Dominick's one day and bought fruit, vegetables, fish, chicken, and whole wheat/grain everything. At first, I was not happy about the food. But, being a student, I wasn't about to go out and buy another batch of groceries (which would have consisted of cheetoes, mountain dew, etc.). So, I forced my self to eat the better food. I, actually, quickly began to enjoy it.  As I said above, I rarely have had much exercise in my life. With the addition of having a gym in my nearby (in my apartment complex), I felt I had no excuse to not use it. With the goal to lose weight in mind, I began jogging on the treadmill. I could barely do 1/2 a mile a day. With practice, I started pushing further. Then further. Then off the treadmill and outside (when it was still warm enough).  I guess I really wanted to change because I was sick of my lazy ass. It was depressing to see myself in the mirror everyday *when I knew* I was capable of changing. I guess that was the idea that motivated me the most: I had no physical disability or health issue that was preventing me from slimming up, so why the hell wasn't I doing it?   ☑ Tips/tricks that worked for you   I hate to sound like a local commercial here, but will power seriously helped quite a bit. I already went into it above, so please read that paragraph.  Consistent meals. I ate around 300 calories around every 6 hours starting from the beginning. This has steadily risen since I've changed some of my eating habits and am now trying to gain muscle. Also, NO SNACKING. If you really need something to hold you over, grab some salad or a little fruit.   Don't overwork yourself. At one point I was pushing myself to run 4 miles a day and do an hour of anaerobic activity. I stressed the hell out of myself and could never recommend that to anyone who is a beginner.  Break up your routines and vary them.  If you want to, download one of the many calorie apps for your phone. It helped me learn about foods and their nutrients (since most of the apps show nutritional values for foods as well). iPump was another app that introduced me to some pretty decent anaerobic routines.   Lastly, read r/Fitness (as you all are, haha). You guys have inspired me like hell. Seeing several transformation posts over last Summer just made me think about how I had the ability to do similar.  ☑ Medical issues/considerations   Like I said before, don't push yourself too hard. The weight will come off eventually. Just be consistent and try not to break from a routine that doesn't cost you too harshly.  ☑ Anaerobic routine   Mostly free-weight routines and a little lifting during the first couple of months. But, since around January, I changed up my weekly routine. I noticed I wasn't really losing weight anymore. So, I decided to start gaining muscle. I played around with the above mentioned iPhone app and started following some of the premade routines. I also did some research on various body building websites and what-not. For the past three-weeks I've started doing a 5x5 workout three times a week. I also run 4-5 miles three times a week and do weighted ab exercises on those days.   ☑ Aerobic routine   Run every other day about 4-5 miles.   ☑ Height   5'10.5  ☑ Supplementation  I begun taking whey isolate protein in late February (Myofusion). I take two scoops after each work out. I've always felt that I digest slowly, so I sometimes take the shake with me to the gym and sip on it. Every other day I try to have at least one shake.   Also, I started eating a whole lot more chicken and fish products and, basically, dropping carbs (especially after work-outs). I take a Vitamin C/B6/B12 boost before workouts for some added energy.   EDIT: I wanted to add something else really quick.  ☑ Awesome/Weird Side Effects  Hair, as you can obviously notice. This is a little odd to me. Maybe someone could kindly explain? Haha. It's not really a big deal or anything.  Sexual libido/Confidence. It's awesome that I actually have the motivation to try and meet girls at bars now. I was never really confident enough before. I would always just go ahead and give up on trying because I didn't think I'd have a chance. Even if I did, I would have given up on the issue. So.. I guess getting into shape raised my confidence which upped my sexual libido. It's actually been going very well.. except for the hair (but, many times they are in to that type of thing :) )  Acne resolution. Last summer I was a total pizza face. I now have a completely clear face. I can't directly trace that to working out (maybe I grew out of it finally?), but I'm sure it helped. (Edit: As cdwillis pointed out, this was, actually, more likely to my change in diet. The highly greasy foods I was eating was most likely causing the acne.)  Dropping cigarettes. I tried many, many times before, let me tell you. But there is no way to keep up a running routine when going on half a pack a day. I starting dropping them gradually until they completely vanished from my routines. This began when I planned on running later in the day, so I knew I couldn't smoke as much during that day. Eventually, I just dropped them all together.  I actually have to get going and buy some groceries, so please feel free to ask anything and I'll get to any questions when I get back!  EDIT 2:  I just wanted to add: Thank you all again for your kind replies and providing the inspiration for me to not only do this, but go further. I hope that this post will affect someone else, just as many of you have affected me. Seriously, it's really satisfying to have to buy a new belt because you're sick of cutting smaller notches into the old one :) .  EDIT 3: I woke up to even more great replies to my progress and, well, chest hair, so thanks again guys! Also, I appreciate the anonymously donated month of Reddit Gold.

In the case of severe over-pronators, Vibram FiveFingers might not be a wise choice for weight-bearing activities. Over-pronators will definitely benefit from some focused rehabilitation and foot-specific exercises before wearing any minimalist footwear.  This applies to any minimal shoe. They are a great tool for all around leg strengthening... just do it slowly. Unless the overpronation is severe, it should be something you should be able to work through with a minimal shoe.

When you purchase a new copy of Portal 2 for PlayStation®3, you will receive an in-box code which provides your linked Steam account with access to your copy of Portal 2 on your computer. The game is still owned by only a single Steam account--another copy will be required to play online co-op with a friend.",®

t5_2qh03,TJ_FS,1302858220,"They said it couldn't be done. Some people (Robin Walker) were emphatic that it should not be done. In fact, some people (Robin again) even threatened us not to do it.   But we are doing it. Welcome to the Hatless Update—where we leave the safety of hat-based updates to explore a bold new hatless frontier, our heads held high (though unsheltered from the elements).    And why? Because Team Fortress is no one-trick pony. As you can clearly see from the embarrassment of miscellaneous improvements making up the Hatless Update, this pony easily—easily—knows seven, possibly even eight tricks. We went and looked through some equestrian training manuals, and it turns out that's a very respectable number.   In other games, admitting that you’d like some help playing the game is tantamount to announcing that you’d like to hear all the new horrible insults the kids are using today. Not here. Utilizing state-of-the-art Altruism® technology, TF2 will help matchmake you with a coach, who can enter your game and give you some useful tips while tethered to you.Three new classes join the Soldier for basic training. Learn the detonation essentials behind being a good Demo Man; find out what to build, when, and why playing as the Engineer; and get the cloaking and backstabbing basics behind the double-crossing Spy.   We've rebuilt our UI to support basic voting in such world-defining matters as deciding which level to play next and whether or not to kick out that one guy who keeps making trouble. Years from now, you can tell your children that you were there, and that your vote made a difference.   We’ve significantly reduced the amount of memory TF2 uses, which means improved performance. You might not even notice the difference. But what better way to let your computer know you care than by making it work slightly less hard loading your games for you? It puts up with a lot, your computer. More importantly, it’s seen a lot. Too much. Don’t kid yourself, when the singularity hits, it’ll blackmail you into the ground. Be nice to it now while there’s still time.   Servers can now associate themselves with a Steam ID, which’ll allow us to track servers better going forward, rewarding the good ones and punishing the bad. If years from now you’re wondering how the entire TF2 team got a God complex, it probably started here. We’ve added a few tweaks to our Dueling system. Now when you enter into a duel, you'll be given the option to select a mutual class that you and your fellow duel enthusiast will then be locked into for the duration of the game.    Watch your backs. The Spy-Bot’s undergone significant improvements, and is now 50% more devious with his disguises and sentry-sapping. So realistic, you’ll swear the person who gained your trust and back-stabbed you was human. Plus, Offline Practice mode now supports Payload.    TF2’s now hooked up to Steam's new SILK audio codec, which dynamically adjusts bandwidth demands for superior internet audio. Listen to people around the world call you horrible things with crystal clarity.   Not since Leonardo Dicaprio painted that famous chapel in France has paint been put to such good use. Previously, painted hats were not visible in DX8. Now—wait for it—they are. Plus, improved shading within painted objects will now fit within the world lighting better.   That’s right, folks! It’s the classic Badlands map you know and love—but now there’s less of it! We pain-stakingly cut out vast swaths of map to bring you Badlands’ inaugural King of the Hill competition.  Added new map Koth_Badlands  Updated CP_Well  Spawn room by second cap for each time is now a one-way door  *Updated Training*  Added 3 new training courses for the Demoman, Engineer, and Spy  Added the Ready for Duty achievement for completing all of the training courses  Added a new system to associate dedicated servers with Steam accounts  Use the ConCommand ""cl_gameserver_create_identity"" in the Team Fortress 2 client console to create a server account using the currently logged in Steam account. This will generate values for ""tf_server_identity_account_id"" and ""tf_server_identity_token""  Put the values for ""tf_server_identity_account_id"" and ""tf_server_identity_token"" into your  server.cfg  Use the ConCommand ""cl_gameserver_list"" in the Team Fortress 2 client console to list all of the game server accounts owned by the currently logged in Steam account  **Added a new system for coaching players  Added a new vote system**  Server convars to control the vote system  sv_allow_votes : Allow voting?  sv_vote_failure_timer : A vote that fails cannot be voted on again during this period.  sv_vote_allow_specators : Allow spectators to vote?  sv_vote_issue_changelevel_allowed : Allow votes to change levels?  sv_vote_issue_kick_allowed : Allow votes to kick players from the server?  sv_vote_issue_nextlevel_allowed : Allow votes to set the next level?  sv_vote_issue_nextlevel_allowextend : Allow votes to extend the current map?  sv_vote_issue_restart_game_allowed : Allow votes to restart the game?  sv_vote_issue_scramble_teams_allowed : Allow votes to scramble the teams?  sv_vote_issue_nextlevel_choicesmode : Present players with a list of maps with the lowest playtimes to choose from?  sv_vote_kick_ban_duration : How long should a kick vote ban someone from the server? (in minutes)  dynamic model loading to improve performance   **Combat Text changes**  Added a new convar ""hud_combattext_healing"" to display the amount of healing done per second  Added bonus points to the items displayed using Combat Text  Starting position of values is now affected by range to target, making it easier to see numbers when next to targets  Updated voice to use the Steam voice codec to improve quality  Servers can toggle between the old codec and the new codec with the convar ""sv_use_steam_voice"", which defaults to 1.  Fixed not being able to see the correct colors for painted hats when running with DX8  Fixed not being able to see the | character in custom names and descriptions  Fixed a couple cases where custom sprays would not import correctly   **Duel changes**  The duel dialog has been extended to include class-specific duels in addition to the default duels  Duel badges now only show the number of wins a player has  Added Payload maps to Offline Practice  Fixed taunt kills made with a Katana not counting towards honorbound kills  Fixed a bug where killing a Katana wielder with a Katana was incorrectly causing an increased crit chance  Fixed infinite noisemakers exploit where noisemakers could continue to be used after their charges had run out  Improved the Medic overheal effect so it's more noticeable  Fixed func_build entities to respect the team value and prevent the associated team from building in the area   **Items changes:**  Added new ""Sort by Rarity"" option for sorting backpack items  Improved the backpack sorting algorithms  Added ""styles"" for the Ghastlier Gibus, Scotsman's Stove Pipe, Treasure Hat, Hat of Undeniable   Wealth And Respect, and the Googly Gazer  Added paint preview to the preview section when shopping for hats  Updated the Googly Gazer to be paintable  Added new paint styles to the Pyromancer's Mask  Items in the action slot won't be swapped until returning to a supply cabinet  Replaced the no-crit attribute with -25% damage on the following: The Eyelander, The Gunslinger, The Southern Hospitality, The Powerjack (also added +20% melee vulnerability) The Horseless Headless Horseman's Headtaker, The Ullapool Caber, The Claidheamohmor  Dalokohs Bar Removed item cool down meter and ammo count when using the Dalokohs Bar  Fists of Steel  Increase deploy times 20%  Ranged damage reduced 40% (down from 60%)   Loch-n-Load  Damage increased by 10%  Equalizer  Tuned high-end damage range so it's no longer possible to one-shot certain classes  Suppress the medic call effect while active   Battalion’s Backup  Reduced rage generation rate by 50%   Concheror  Damage-to-health conversion increased to 35% (from 20%)   Mad Milk  Heal 60% of damage done (down from 75%)   Sun-on-a-Stick  Base damage lowered slightly but guarantees crits against burning players instead of mini-crits   Fan O’ War  Marking someone for death now lasts 15 seconds (from 10 seconds)   Flaregun  Flares always crit burning targets, regardless of range   Backburner   Removed the restriction on airblast  Ammo cost increased 150% (4 blasts at full ammo)  Damage bonus reduced to 10% (from 15%)   Sydney Sleeper:  Charge rate increased 25%   **Bot changes:**  Added Spy TFBots. Spy bots have basic cloaking, diguising, sapping, and backstabbing behaviors now, and are ready to join the fight  TFBots understand the basics of the Payload scenario now, and will push the cart on offense, and try to stop the cart on defense  Added navigation meshes for pl_goldrush, pl_badwater, pl_upward, pl_thundermountain, and pl_hoodoo_final  Improved TFBot reactions to cloaked and/or disguised enemy Spies  Improved Demoman bot behaviors for planting sticky bomb traps  Demoman bots will now try to move to a safe spot and lob stickybombs onto enemy sentry nests to destroy them  Soldier bots switch to their shotgun after emptying their rocket launcher at close/medium range  TFBots will no longer hide from sapped or carried sentryguns  Engineer bots are better at moving their sentry gun nest as the scenario changes  Improved Sniper bot algorithm for finding good sniping spots for both Capture Point and  Payload scenarios  Sniper bots will take opportunistic shots at targets while they move to their desired sniping spot  Fixed bug where Sniper bots would sometimes stand around in their spawn room doing nothing.  Improved TFBot ability to find a safe vantage spot to attack enemy sentry guns  TFBots will no longer try to use a teleporter entrance they can't actually reach  Added tf_bot_melee_only cvar. If set to 1, all TFBots will be restricted to only using their melee weapon.  **Edit for clarity**",®

If it comes in *every* copy no matter what, that may explain why my local game store didn't kow a thing about it. They said that when redeemable codes come with games, they come separately and they have to put it in the packaging themselves. But that'd only be in cases such as pre-order bonuses, whereas in this case if it comes with literally *every* copy, it's probably put in the packaging at time of production so the store stuff wouldn't have to make any special cases for it.  If any of that was difficult to follow, then I'm not surprised. But I'm fairly confident now that although I'm halfway across the world, I should still get a redeemable code.",®

FROM THE RIVER TO THE SEA, PALESTINE WILL BE FREE FROM ARABS ! ARABS GO BACK TO ARABIA !  Arabs from Arabia, Judes/Jews from Judea  א  Britannica Concise Encyclopedia   Palestine  biblical Canaan  Region, at the eastern end of the Mediterranean Sea.  It extends east to the Jordan River, north to the border between Israel and Lebanon, west to the Mediterranean, and south to the Negev desert, reaching the Gulf of Aqaba. The political status and geographic area designated by the term have changed considerably over the course of three millennia. The eastern boundary has been particularly fluid, often understood as lying east of the Jordan and extending at times to the edge of the Arabian Desert. A land of sharp contrasts, Palestine includes the Dead Sea, the lowest natural point of elevation on Earth, and mountain peaks higher than 2,000 ft (610 m) above sea level. In the 20th and 21st centuries it has been the object of conflicting claims by Jewish and Arab national movements. The region is sacred to Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Settled since early prehistoric times, mainly by Semitic groups, it was occupied in biblical times by the kingdoms of Israel, Judah, and Judaea. It was subsequently held by virtually every power of the Middle East, including the Assyrians, Persians, Romans, Byzantines, Crusaders, and Ottomans. It was governed by Britain under a League of Nations mandate from the end of World War I (1914–18) until 1948, when the State of Israel was proclaimed. Armies from Egypt, Transjordan, Syria, and Iraq attacked the next day. They were defeated by the Israeli army. See Israel, Jordan, West Bank, and Gaza Strip for the later history of the region.  West Bank == Judea and Samaria  1) Judaea or Judea  Southern division of ancient Palestine successively under Persian, Greek, and Roman rule.  It was bounded on the north by Samaria and on the west by the Mediterranan Sea. It succeeded the Hebrew kingdom of Judah, which was destroyed by the Babylonians. The revived kingdom of Judaea was established by the Maccabees, who resisted the suppression of Judaism under foreign rule. Family disputes led to Roman intervention in 63 BC. Under Roman control, Herod (the Great) was made king of Judaea in 37 BC. After Herod's death the country was ruled alternately by his descendants (see Herod Antipas; Herod Agrippa I) and by Roman procurators. As a result of the Jewish revolt in AD 66, the city of Jerusalem was destroyed (AD 70). The name Judaea is used by Israelis to describe approximately the same area in the modern West Bank territory.  © 2005 Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.  ",©

t5_2qh03,Jude-From-Judea,1303041634," 2) Samaria  Central region, ancient Palestine.  Extending about 40 mi (65 km) north-south and 35 mi (55 km) east-west, it was bounded by Galilee to the north, Judaea to the south, the Mediterranean Sea to the west, and the Jordan River to the east. It corresponds roughly to the northern portion of the modern West Bank territory. Ancient Shechem (near modern Nābulus) was the region's crossroads and political centre until the Assyrian conquest of Israel in the 8th century BC. The town of Samaria, its capital, was built by King Omri с 880 BC. It was taken by Sargon II in с 724–721 BC, and its inhabitants were transported into captivity. It was rebuilt by Herod the Great, who renamed it Sebaste in honour of the Roman emperor Augustus (Greek, Sebastos). In AD 6 the region became part of the Roman province of Judaea.  © 2005 Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.   3) Israel, tribes of  In the Bible, the 12 clans of the ancient Hebrew people, which were named for the sons of Jacob (Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Zebulun, Joseph, Benjamin, Gad, Asher, Dan, and Naphtali) and his wives, Leah and Rachel, and concubines, Bilhah and Zilpah.  The tribe of Levi did not receive land in the settlement of Canaan but instead was given the priestly office. To maintain the traditional number of 12 tribes, the line of Joseph was divided into the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh. In Israel's later history, the tribes of Judah and Benjamin formed a southern kingdom called Judah with its capital at Jerusalem, while the 10 northern tribes formed the kingdom of Israel. After being conquered by Assyria in 721 BC, the northern tribes were exiled from the kingdom and were assimilated by other peoples. Disappearing from history, they became known as the 10 lost tribes of Israel and remained part of Jewish folklore and eschatological beliefs. The tribes of Judah and Benjamin survived until Nebuchadrezzar's conquest of Judah in 586 BC, when many from the kingdom were exiled to Babylon.   © 2005 Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.  4) Judah  One of the 12 tribes of Israel, descended from Judah, the fourth son of Jacob.  The tribe of Judah entered Canaan with the other Israelites after the escape from Egypt and settled in the region south of Jerusalem. It eventually became the most powerful tribe, producing the kings David and Solomon, and it was prophesied that the messiah would come from among its members. After the 10 northern tribes were dispersed by the Assyrian conquest of 721 BC, the tribes of Judah and Benjamin were left as the sole inheritors of the Mosaic covenant. Judah flourished until 586 BC, when it was overrun by the Babylonians and many of its people were carried into exile. Cyrus II allowed them to return in 538 BC, and the Temple of Jerusalem was rebuilt. The history of Judah from that time forward is the history of the Jews and Judaism. The kingdom of Judah was succeeded by Judaea.   © 2005 Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. ב  ARABS GO BACK TO ARABIA !  In all the territories of Israel there is not even one Arab that hasn't got an Arab homeland therefore they are Arabs. They have invaded/infiltrated/trickled into Israel under encouragement of the Ottoman and British occupiers but they, under these circumstances, have not become the owners. Look at the world map my deluded friends. You will see that that the territory of the Arab states (22) is bigger then the entire continent of Europe, and that the territory of all the Muslem states (56) covers about a third of the Earth. A colossal amount of land, unlimited resources of oil and wealth. So it seems only right that the Jewish people have a tiny country of their own without having to share it with another Muslim nation, don't you agree? Let me tell you a few words about the Palestinian people, there is no such thing! The Palestinians are a fiction with only one purpose-to destroy the state of Israel... Let's start with the name shall we? The Romans that conquered Judea called it as part of the conquest ""Provincia Palestina"" - named for the Philistines who lived in the coastal cities of Israel. The Philistines were redheaded seafarers that came to Israel from EUROPE and disappeared from our territory 1600 years before the birth of Muhammad. The Arabs from the Persian Gulf have no connection to the Philistines, neither genetic, nor cultural, historical or geographical. They are Arabs and not Philistines. So tell me, if the Romans would have called Judea ""Provincia Germany"" would the Arabs be Germans? And now for Israel itself... Choose any Historical record; any Historical map or any Historian accepted by the international academy to show us where Palestine is exactly, when there was a time in Human history when there was a country called Palestine, when there was a time when there was such a nation, the Palestinian nation? Who are they? Where did they come from? And what is their connection to the land of Israel? I cannot find a single detail in any place in the world including the Qur’an (in which Israel is called ""The land of Israel, The land of the Israelite people."") There is a Roman historical record, a Byzantine, an Ottoman historical record and a British historical record; there is no trace of the Palestinian people or a Palestinian nation. Let us conclude then, that if any of you find any record of the Palestinian existence (that is not Palestinian propaganda that seems to create its own history to fit its needs), than we have something to begin with. The Palestinians are a gathering of people from the Moslem world that hate each other almost...almost as they hate us. That is practically the only thing that unites the Palestinians - the hate towards Zionists, that is a very poor basis upon which to erect a nation! In 1948 the number of Arabs within the borders of Israel was identical to the number of Jews in the Arabic countries. The 20th century was a century of immigration upon the entire planet. All the Jews from the Arab countries immigrated to their homeland - Israel. All the Arabs from Israel were supposed to immigrate back to their Arab homelands... however they continued to infiltrate Israel in any possible manner you can imagine. In fact there is already a Palestinian nation, it is Jordan, however the nation that does not exist want 3 Palestines - Jordan, the Gaza strip and the West Bank and of course the Israeli Arabs who consider themselves Palestinians shall bring to Israel more and more Palestinian ""Brothers"" from all around the world until the Jews shall become a minority in their own country, sorry guys, doesn't work for us! So eventually all the Palestinians will have to turn back and leave to their Arab homelands, that will happen either by goodwill or by the sword of King David! During the years of the Jewish settlements you have adopted the Jewish legacy, that is - the holiness of Jerusalem and the right to return to Zion. You have even build a Mosque on the centre of Mount Moria - The Holiest of Holy places of the Jews (a well known custom of the Moslems) however your Holy city is Mecca, not Jerusalem, and the only right the Palestinians have is to return to their Arab homelands. In conclusion, I would ask you to refer to a cute little book full of humor called ""A delightful journey in the Holy-Land"" written by Samuel Longhorn (more commonly known as Mark Twain). Longhorn traveled in Israel in 1867, he did not see neither Palestinians, nor green pastures, nor Arab villages, nor bustling cities, nothing! He saw and described swamps, sickness, Malaria, unending desert and no civilization what so ever. ""The land of tears"", that is how he called Israel. Everything that is here, this paradise called Israel is what the Zionists made it, no wonder the Arabs want it, it is the only fully modern country in the Middle-East...and if any Palestinians will sit now in their house which is connected to electricity and running water and type an enraged counter-post to mine it is because the Zionists made it possible for you to live on a different level than 99% of your brothers in the Arab world and you have expressed your gratitude by shelling us with rockets! A Jewish-Israeli Citizen-The owner of this place.  About Gaza:  Israel left Gaza since 2005  And what going on there is the Arabs in Gaza problem  Hamas using children, populated places and populous so people will get attention...  stupidly Israel called to the people cellphones and phones in the Area to get out because from that places they shooting and firing on Israel. Those that stayed - take the blame on themselves  Stupidly Israel and others give aid Gaza more then to any other place on Earth !  Some Israelis care how others see them more then to stop the Arabs terror ...And even today the Arabs in Gaza getting more weapons from Iran and Syria...And aid, money, etc., support from others... include UN, Europe , USA, organizations and Arab States amazing...

t5_2qhhn,legalize2012,1303248534,"I think you are right that people are concerned about it.  I think you are wrong that it is, itself, an issue, even a minor one.  While there are measurable changes in reaction time and such when under the influence of cannabinoids it affects the human mind completely differently.  The first, and most important point to bring up is that the human brain is capable of compensating 100% in cases where a split-second emergency decision is required.  The adrenal response is able to completely compensate and the reaction time is equivalent to that of a ""normal"" person.  Next, for those experienced with the effects of cannabis there is no greater chance of accident, and according to some studies a reduced occurrence of collisions.  The only significant increase in accidents is in studies specifically related to teen drivers, the same drivers that in many states are not allowed to drive after dark or with other passengers in the vehicle.  Also, teens are notoriously inexperienced in cannabis use as well and furthermore oftentimes unable to assess their ability to drive.  When the results of the studies who measure only ability impairment due to cannabis use (not cannabis combined with other drugs including alcohol) there is no significant increase in the risk of collisions.  The warning label on Marinol® says to not drive until you know how it will affect your ability to drive.  It does not say to not drive while taking it.  Furthermore, with alcohol the effects mask the level of impairment.  With cannabis the effects increase the user's awareness of the impairment.  This means someone who is too drunk probably won't realize it, but someone who is too stoned is very unlikely to drive.  Their perception of their impairment is magnified such that they will choose not to drive even in cases where they are still capable of safely operating a vehicle.  And the law in question had nothing do to with any of this.  The law was to implement a per se limit.  Basically, you were impaired because the law said 5ng/ml is the point where you are unable to drive safely, not because your abilities were actually impaired.  This allows law enforcement to arrest more ""impaired drivers"" and allow the DA to get more convictions by removing the accused's right to present a reasonable defense as to their level of impairment.  It is already illegal to drive stoned in the state of Colorado.  It is illegal to drive with your abilities impaired in any way.  There is no need for this law on multiple levels.  The net result is a reduction in freedoms and rights of the people and a gain in power for the government. ",®

In animal models, maternal diet alters offspring body composition, accompanied by epigenetic changes in metabolic control genes. Little is known about whether such processes operate in humans.  **RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS** Using Sequenom MassARRAY we measured the methylation status of 68 CpGs 5′ from five candidate genes in umbilical cord tissue DNA from healthy neonates. Methylation varied greatly at particular CpGs: for 31 CpGs with median methylation ≥5% and a 5–95% range ≥10% we related methylation status to maternal pregnancy diet and to child’s adiposity at age 9 years. Replication was sought in a second independent cohort.  **RESULTS** In cohort 1, retinoid X receptor-α (RXRA) chr9:136355885+ and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) chr7:150315553+ methylation had independent associations with sex-adjusted childhood fat mass (exponentiated regression coefficient [β] 17% per SD change in methylation [95%CI 4–31], P = 0.009, n = 64, and β = 20% [9–32], P &lt; 0.001, n = 66, respectively) and %fat mass (β = 10% [1–19], P = 0.023, n = 64 and β =12% [4–20], P = 0.002, n = 66, respectively). Regression analyses including sex and neonatal epigenetic marks explained &gt;25% of the variance in childhood adiposity. Higher methylation of RXRA chr9:136355885+, but not of eNOS chr7:150315553+, was associated with lower maternal carbohydrate intake in early pregnancy, previously linked with higher neonatal adiposity in this population. In cohort 2, cord eNOS chr7:150315553+ methylation showed no association with adiposity, but RXRA chr9:136355885+ methylation showed similar associations with fat mass and %fat mass (β = 6% [2–10] and β = 4% [1–7], respectively, both P = 0.002, n = 239).  **CONCLUSIONS** Our findings suggest a substantial component of metabolic disease risk has a prenatal developmental basis. Perinatal epigenetic analysis may have utility in identifying individual vulnerability to later obesity and metabolic disease.  Received July 14, 2010.

t5_6,leoboiko,1303317544,"True enough :) though that is a rare character and I don’t know ancient Chinese so I don’t know how exactly it was used.  I went with the funniest gloss, but judging from kanjidic it’s likely it meant something like “numerous”.   In any case a character wasn’t read as “many words”; that thing with the horses, etc., was simply “jí”.  Each character generally stands (or used to stood) for a single Chinese morpheme, so with four characters all you can get is a four-morpheme phrase (the distinction between words and sentences being kinda blurred): jí cū xiān líng, in your example.  It would be like writing the English fragment “upvote your page” as “↑☑☞▯”.  When adapted for Japanese, several times they lacked an equivalent Japanese morpheme and were forced to translate a character into two native words (e.g. 快 → こころ よい、 唇 → くち びる), but even then—you still have a lower bound: to write a story you’ll need at least as many characters as the number of Chinese morphemes needed to tell it.

Please see the following website: http://www.drinkaware.co.uk/  ***DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME WITH ALCOHOL***  Intellectual Property of Niall Carr, Mike Scott, Steven Bayles and Thomas Artemius Lowe. ©  Now the boring stuff is out of the way, lets proceed with what we're all here for...  If you've made it this far, you, like us, are looking to remember (or not) the Royal Wedding as a truly messy occassion. The only things required are something to drink and a jug that shall be known as ""The Future Kings Cup"" the use of this will become clear later, although I'm sure the more experienced amongst you will be aware of its purpose. The rules are as follows (they may ocassionally enconter something of a restructuring to make them more intelligble or generally better), although as it stands they are incomplete, which means I need your suggestions to make this the best damn day it can be...  1. If the Queen is on the screen you must be drinking. The woman has ruled the country for over 50 years, the least you can do is get destroyed in her honour.  2. Any time Prince Harry appears all players must produce a Nazi salute. The last player to do so must consume 5 fingers/mouthfuls for their poor reactions.  3. If Elton John is spotted the last person to shout ""Candle in the Wind"" must drink 5.  4. Any time time paralells are drawn to the Diana and Charles wedding (or any previous Royal Wedding for that matter), by commentators or otherwise, all players must consume 3 fingers/mouthfuls of their drink.   5.We're British (or shall assume the role for the day), which means we're a simple folk who enjoy comforts such as bacon and beer. With this in mind then, what better way to greet our anthem than with a hearty chug. As a result when the National Anthem is playing, everyone must be stood up and drinking. (Cheers to Will Sugg for inspiring this rule)  6.William will one day become king of this fine country, a fact that needs to be celebrated no? Every time the word ""future"" is said, in the mentioned context or not, an amount no less than 1 finger must be added to the ""Future Kings Cup"" by any player. This should then go in a clockwise direction from the first player to do so everytime future is mentioned, to ensure the cup has a good mix of drinks. (Cheers to Sam Baggot for inspiring this rule)  7. And following on from Rule 6, The last person to shout ""God save the future King!"" upon the proclamation of ""I now pronounce you man and wife"" has to down the Future King's Cup. I fear for those that are last here, I really do. (Cheers to Dick Sharp for inspiring this rule)  8. Prince Phillip has found a warm place in many of our hearts, his ""Racist Grandad"" appeal simply too hard too dislike. As a result, whenever he is shown independant of the Queen (to avoid complications with rule 1), the last player to shout ""Bloody Foreigners"" must drink 3 fingers. Penalties can be awarded for anyone who makes no attempt to imitate his accent.  9. Prime Ministers never tend to be popular, but our current one is hated even by those standards. So to allow you all to ""stick it to da man"" whenever our fearless leader David Cameron appears on screen, the first player to shout ""Cunt"" (substitute for a less offensive word if necessary) is allowed to come up with a rule of their own. Enjoy your one chance at tyranny!  10.Whenever the union flag appears on screen, the first to shout ""rule brittania"" is bestowed with the honor of delegating four measures however they see fit, one for each nation of the UK. This can either be to single player, or spread amongst them. Make sure our great flag is honoured with the drinking it deserves!  There we have it then, the 10 rules for what could be the least remembered Royal Wedding in history. It's been emotional!",©

If you had a product that helped out the well-being of man kind, how would you be able to produce more of it if you were giving it out for free? Free mind or not, i wanted to spread the news to my r/trees family about how these Brain Sync program have done wonders to my motivation, relationships, sense of self, stress management, and overall confidence. I bought the focused learning, deep meditation, and positive thinking mp3's for around $30.   Whats it about?: Just as you turn the dial on a radio to get the station you want, with Brain Sync you can tune your consciousness to the ideal state of mind . Want to meditate or explore the mysteries of your mind? Listen to Theta Waves. Want to study for an exam, Gamma Waves will boost your brain into high gear. Need a good night's sleep? Delta Waves will help you get the rest your body craves. Feeling overwhelmed and need to chill? Alpha Waves wash away stress and increase creativity.  How it works: Brain Sync programs use window frequencies – extremely precise frequencies that fit through narrow biological windows to impact the body at a cellular level. The choice of frequencies specifically selected are based on extensive biofeedback research to help you achieve the same optimal brain states scientists have discovered in remarkable men and women.  Clinical indications: Brain Sync programs have been clinically tested with a record-breaking 87% success rate and are offered to patients at America's most prestigious hospitals. EEG studies conducted at Harvard Body Mind Medical School and UCLA concluded that Kelly Howell's Brain Wave Audio Technology® prompts brain activity into extraordinary body-mind states.     ",®
t5_6,ropers,1303676482,"It's funny :) -- but in case you were serious, it's also fallacious logic:   Most of your examples fail a very relevant (unstated but implied) test. That test is the question, *""Does this affect others?""*  &gt; Don't like semi-automatic weapons? Don't buy one.  **%** Anybody who's ever participated in an arms race knows that weapons ownership (not to mention use) *can* have very real effects on others. But it depends. I would be inclined to half grant you that point.  &gt; Don't like stealing? Don't steal.  ✘ Fail. Stealing affects others.  &gt; Don't like murder? Don't kill anyone.  ✘ Fails the test, as per the above.  &gt; Don't like poverty? Don't be poor.  In the absence of a complete social safety net in a solidaric society, anyone can in principle fall below the poverty line. Not only does poverty affect others, it even affects others if you are not poor. In profoundly and inherently unequal societies, your not being poor may even contribute to making or keeping others poor.  ✘ Fail.  ----  Now to apply that same test to the above examples:  &gt; Don't like gay marriage? Don't get one.  ✔ Does not affect others (other than the couple).  &gt; Don't like abortions? Don't get one.  **%** The question whether this affects others or not runs down to the question whether DNA/gametes/zygotes/morulae/blastocysts, etc. can own themselves, and if not, at what stage then they subsequently turn into persons who can. However, most vocal abortion opponents profess opposition to *all* abortions, even at the earliest stages, so then it's the former question of the *whether*, and not the latter question of the *when*. Figuring out how much sense it makes to proclaim that a zygote/morula/blastocyst, etc. is ""another person who would be affected"" is left as an exercise to the reader.  &gt; Don't like drugs? Don't do them.  **%** Whether or not drug consumption affects others (apart from the consumers) is related both to the *inherent harmfulness* of the particular drug (leading to medical costs, antisocial behaviour, etc.) and to the *extrinsic harmfulness* of the drug (i.e. how dangerous a particular drug can become or is made in a certain social environment, in specific conditions, and under an existing (legal) framework).   Differences between different substances which may be consumed as drugs mean that not all drugs are inherently as dangerous as any other. Differences between various social environments mean that even identical substances may not be equally dangerous or not be turned into something equally dangerous in all societies and jurisdictions.Traditions and technology also play roles. Coca leaves are not as dangerous in Andean communities as they are in many prohibitive industrialized ""Western"" societies.   &gt; Don't like sex? Don't have it.  ✔ Does not affect uninvolved others.",✔

t5_2qh13,foopirata,1303687728,"&gt; Because first, Israel does 90%+ of the killing.  In WWII the Allies killed much more than the Axis. Does that mean the Allies were the ""abuser"" ? No. It does not. Counting corpses is a terrible way of understanding a war.  &gt; Second, because Israel is the occupying power.   Israel left Gaza in 2005. The West Bank is going through an economic boom caused in great part by Israel removing barriers and obstacles. In the first case, Israel is clearly not the ""occupying power"". And as the second case shows, when Israel is not provoked, progress ensues. So no, your second point appears to be wrong as well.  &gt; your language indicates a pretty unsavory view of the other, by the way - are they not human beings, as valuable as you?  You seem to be unfamiliar with the popular concept of the underdog. I suggest you do some more reading.  &gt; Tell me with a straight face that you would passively accept occupation.  Probably not, but I'd probably recognize that once the occupation is gone, it is time for building, not for trying to destroy further.  &gt; withdraw to the 67 borders  See how well that worked in Gaza and Lebanon, eh?  &gt;  let the Palestinians have their little state with territorial integrity  Ever considered that if Gaza and the West Bank have territorial integrity, then Israel does not? How does that work?  &gt; Palestinians recognize Israel and give up the right of return to Israel.  Does it seem like it is happening any time soon? Have you read the papers in the last two days?   &gt; Why didn't it happen? Because Israel didn't (or perhaps couldn't, for internal reasons)  So Israel controls the Palestinians recognizing it and giving up the right of return? Seriously?  &gt; but it can't have it all and not give the ""dog"" equal rights.  There is a clear distinction between using the word ""underdog"" and calling someone a dog.

t5_2r9vp,darkrom,1304149835,"Some relevant info for this since I see a lot of misinformation specifically about melatonin.  You are all more familiar with it than you think.   Effects of THC on Melatonin Secretion in Man  Marijuana can be Anti-Addictive  Melatonin and Dreams   Taken from: MELATONIN: Your Body's Natural Wonder Drug,  Russel J. Reiter, Ph.D., Jo Robinson;Â©1995 Bantam Books:198-199  Of all the known ways to stimulate melatonin production, none is more dramatic than smoking marijuana. Marijuana stimulates production of a prostaglandin called PGE2, which may relate to its ability to stimulate melatonin production. Italian researchers discovered that when eight men smoked a cigarette containing the active ingredient in marijuana, THC (tetrahydrocannabinol), they had dramatically higher melatonin levels twenty minutes later. After two hours, their melatonin levels were 4,000 percent higher than at baseline!(11)  The fact that smoking marijuana is accompanied by a dramatic increase in melatonin production may explain some of the drug's positive effects. A 1995 article in The Journal of the American Medical Association reported that the hallucinogen is being used to counteract the toxicity of chemotherapy, treat migraines, reduce intraocular pressure, minimize pain, treat menstrual cramps, and moderate wasting syndrome in AIDS patients.(12) Melatonin has been shown to ameliorate each and every one of these conditions.  Smoking marijuana as a vehicle to increase melatonin production, however, may not be a good idea. The increase is so marked that it is not likely to be beneficial, especially if one smokes marijuana during the daytime, when melatonin levels are normally so low that they are just above the level of detection. Causing such a dramatic surge in melatonin levels in the daytime could phase-shift your circadian rhythms or interfere with your health in other as yet unknown ways.  References  11. Lissoni, P., Resentini, M., and Fraschini, F. ""Effects of Tetrahydrocannabinol on Melatonin Secretion in Man."" Hormone and Metabolic Research 1986; 77-78. At baseline, the mean value of their melatonin levels was 21.3 pg/ml. Two hours later, it was 904 pg/ml.  12. Grinspoon, L., and Bakaler, J.B. ""Marihuana as Medicine.""
