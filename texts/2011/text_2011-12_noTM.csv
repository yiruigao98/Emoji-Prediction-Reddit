See Also:  Hi Fi in the Arena: The Concert Sound of the Grateful Dead  The Absolute Sound, Issue 89. Copyright © 1993 by Absolute Multimedia. http://www.frankdoris.com/writing/tas/gratefuldead.htm  &gt;The other night I experienced the finest large-scale High-End audio system I have ever heard. It shattered my preconceived notions of what the state-of-the-art in High End sound reproduction is capable of.  &gt;This system was clean from fewer than five Hertz (according to its designer) to beyond the range of human hearing. Never at any time did I hear distortion. The stereo imaging was pinpoint and extremely accurate, with no bunching, ""hole-in-the-middle,"" or problems at the extreme left and right. (This was accomplished with no room treatment whatsoever.) The tonal balance was almost without flaw (though the highs were slightly too prominent at close range), simply that of the instruments it was reproducing, especially drums, cymbals (which were reproduced with a purity which had to be heard to be believed), and gongs. Its reproduction of the lowest bass was unparalleled—the bass from the Infinity IRS woofers is feeble by comparison. The same can be said about this system's dynamic capability: It could reproduce a clean 120 dB at distance of over 50 feet. Soundstaging? The depth was almost perfectly accurate compared to the locations of the instruments on the stage, and the speakers were capable of generating width in excess of 100 feet. There was an excellent balance of direct-to-hall sound.  &gt;It was easy to see the instruments on the stage. Not ""see"" the instruments, see them. Most important, the emotional connection between the listener and the music—the ability to convey the emotion and feeling inherent in a musical performance being the measure of a truly great High End system—in my opinion was absolute, total, complete.  &gt;The stereo to which I am referring is the Grateful Dead concert sound reinforcement system, heard at the Nassau Coliseum in Long Island, New York.  They ruined me for consumer Hi-Fi... ",©

t5_2qh33,Teotwawki69,1322723175,"Probably the only cases in which ""fair use'"" would cover quoting the entire work would be in a review of haiku or other very short poems. However, in that case, the form of the work -- a critique, literary criticism, non-fiction book about the author of the poem -- would invoke fair use and, in the case of the book, there'd be a little copyright notice up front saying, ""'Herp Derp Poem' © 1947 Edna St. Vincent Price, used with permission,"" and your publisher would have damn well gotten written permission first. Or would get sued later.  By the way, I don't know why you're throwing around the term ""monopoly"" in the context of copyright law, where it doesn't really apply. A monopoly would indicate someone who had gained exclusive distribution rights over a commodity that is not otherwise exclusive owned -- usually commodities like fuel, corn, coal, wheat, cotton, etc. Since a copyrighted work is, by definition, exclusive to the original copyright holders, no monopoly can be granted because the copyright excludes anyone else from the possibility of distributing that work without the permission of the owner. Granting an author a monopoly would look like this: only books by JK Rowling can be sold at Borders. No other authors allowed.  Or maybe that fifty mile wide distinction is too subtle for you.",©

t5_2qhbp,kak0,1322765481,"It is from sunnipath, the link that azeenab gave with sh. hajj jibreel haddad  read to the bottom:   http://qa.sunnipath.com/issue_view.asp?HD=7&amp;ID=4604&amp;CATE=1 ` Our Mother A'isha's Age At The Time Of Her Marriage to The Prophet Answered by Shaykh Gibril F Haddad   Question:  To begin with, I think it is the responsibility of all those who believe that marrying a girl as young as nine years old was an accepted norm of the Arab culture, to provide at least a few examples to substantiate their point of view. I have not yet been able to find a single dependable instance in the books of Arab history where a girl as young as nine years old was given away in marriage. Unless such examples are given, we do not have any reasonable grounds to believe that it really was an accepted norm.  Answer:  In the name of Allah, Most Compassionate, Most Merciful,  - Abu Tughlub ibn Hamdan married the daughter of `Izz al-Dawla Bakhtyar when she was three and paid a dowry of 100,000 dinars. This took place in Safar 360 H. (Ibn al-Athir, al-Kamil).  ... snip many paragraphs  ...  Nowhere does Ibn Hisham say this.  This shows that Ayesha accepted Islam during the first year of Islam. While, if the narrative of Ayesha's marriage at seven years of age is held to be true, Ayesha should not have been born during the first year of Islam.  Rather, Ibn Hisham lists `A'isha among ""those that accepted Islam because of Abu Bakr."" This does not mean that she embraced Islam during the first year of Islam. Nor does it mean that she necessarily embraced Islam before `Umar (year 6) although she was born the previous year (year 7 before the Hijra) although it is understood she will automatically follow her father's choice even before the age of reason.  ... snip many paragraphs  ...  According to Ibn Hajar, Fatimah was five years older than Ayesha. Fatimah is reported to have been born when the Prophet was 35 years old. Thus, even if this information is taken to be correct, Ayesha could by no means be less than 14 years old at the time of hijrah, and 15 or 16 years old at the time of her marriage.   ... snip many paragraphs  ...   These are some of the major points that go against accepting the commonly known narrative regarding Ayesha's (ra) age at the time of her marriage. In my opinion, neither was it an Arab tradition to give away girls in marriage at an age as young as nine or ten years, nor did the Prophet marry Ayesha at such a young age. The people of Arabia did not object to this marriage, because it never happened in the manner it has been narrated.  Those that itch to follow misguidance always resort to solipsisms because they are invariably thin on sources. In this particular case ""the Learner"" proves to be ignorant and dishonest. It is no surprise he moves on every single point, without exception, from incorrect premises to false conclusions.  Hajj Gibril     MMVIII © Qibla.

t5_2qh1i,EvilMisogynist,1322788952,"I have a question for you gals: you're big on equality, or at least claim to be. Why is it acceptable for women to reject men for not conforming to traditional masculine gender roles, but it is unacceptable for men to reject women for not conforming to traditional feminine gender roles? For example, if a woman rejects a man because he isn't confident enough, most women will defend her choice, and if a socially anxious man dares to vent his bitterness, he is derisively referred to as a ""Nice Guy®"" and accused of being a misogynist, but if a man rejects a woman because she is too promiscuous, these same women will criticize this man's preferences as being retrograde and illiberal, and if a ""sexually liberated"" woman complains about this, she is coddled and treated like a victim.  Don't misunderstand me. I'm not naive. No amount of egalitarian guilt-tripping is going to undo millions of years of evolution. But I'm sick of you hypocritical hens exhalting your preferences and impugning those of men, and I will not put up with it. You want to date douchebags. Go ahead.

t5_2t4zh,Robin_Claassen,1322831726,"“Rule 4: If a referee appointed by the tournament organizers feels she or he they can reasonably conclude after a review of all available evidence that he or she feels would help them make their determination that any member of any team violated any of Rules 1-3 during a tournament match, that team shall be immediately disqualified from the tournament, and all members prohibited from all future competitions.”  “Rule 11: If a referee appointed by the tournament organizers feels that he or she can reasonably conclude after a review of all available evidence that he or she feels would help them make their determination that any member of any team violated any of Rules 7-10 during a tournament game, that team shall immediately be considered to have forfeited the game in which the violation occurred.”  My original suggestion was that if a team was found to have violated any of rules 1-3, any past wins that they accrued in the tournament should retroactively be given to the teams that had lost against them.  I failed to state earlier that part of my rationale for suggesting that penalty is that it could be considered unfair for teams that had lost matches due to the other team cheating to still be out of the tournament because the cheating was not discovered until the team they lost to played in a later tournament game. If any player were to be found to have broken any of Rules 1-3, that would essentially show that they had committed an unambiguous act of intentional cheating, and it would be a strong indicator that they or others on their team had also broken one or more of those rules in any past matches they had competed. If you were to implement a retroactive reassignment of wins in the case of a team being discovered to have cheated, you’d have to create a procedure for giving some chance for the teams that had lost matches against teams that were found to be cheating to reenter the tournament, possibly including the replaying of matches, or playing of additional matches. You may decide that the additional work required in such an eventuality would be overly prohibitive. It might make sense in this situation to sacrifice some degree of fairness for the sake of expediency, and have the rules state that any team found to be have violated any of Rules 1-3 would forfeit the last match they played only, however I did want to make sure I clearly articulated my rationale for my original suggestion for you to make that call.  If you don’t wish to implement a system for retroactively reassigning earlier match wins in the case of a team being found to have cheated, I would suggest combining Rules 4 and 11 into a single rule.  As they are currently written, the only difference between them is that there is the additional penalty in Rule 4 of banning all members of a team in which one member was found to be cheating from participating in any future tournaments. Personally, I feel that this additional penalty is overly inflexible and unable to account for all eventualities, and should be removed.  For example, it’s not unimaginable that there could be a conflict between members of a team, resulting in one member of that team purposefully get caught cheating in order to ban the other members of her or his team from ever participating in any future tournament. I think that very few people would consider the banning of all team members in in such a situation to be a just outcome.  Also, I just noticed that I included a typo in Rule 4 that needs to be fixed. The word “they” should be deleted from the first line.  “Rule 5:  Bows, TNT Cannons, and detonating redstone traps are all allowed.”  “Rule 6:  To win a match, a team must complete its victory monument. The Victory Monument must have all three (3) wool blocks in the correct locations to be considered completed. If the Victory Monument is destroyed, all three wool blocks should be placed on dais for the Victory Monument to be considered completed.”  “Rule 12: Wool need not be placed in its exact location on the Victory Monument. If the Victory Monument is destroyed, all three wool blocks should be placed on the back row of the dais to be considered completed.”  Since these rules are all related to each other, and they all provide more of a general layout of the game than the other rules, I would suggest that they be placed next to each other at the beginning of the rule list. I believe that doing so would increase the ease of reading and referencing these rules.  ‘Rule 7: No player shall be permitted to break or destroy any of the three chests in their opponents' lane that begin the game containing colored wool, until and unless the chest in question has first been broken by some other means. These chests will be referred to as ""wool chests"".’  I don’t see any good reason for the inclusion of the definition of the term “wool chest” in this rule, and unless there’s some reason for it being here that I don’t see, I would suggest that it be removed. The term “wool chest” is not used at any other point in these rules, and I don’t see any need to define the term here if it is not used at any other point in these rules.  “Rule 8: No player shall be permitted to place or push blocks outside of his or her lane by any method, including manual placement or pistons.”  If you really want to include this rule, I would suggest that you remove the term “any method”, since that might seem to create some ambiguity around the legality of blasting TNT or other blocks out of your lane with TNT cannons.  ""Rule 9: No player shall be permitted to intentionally break any blocks on the starting platform. No player shall be permitted to take any supplies in the Practice Range from the starting platform.""  Nice addition. I hadn't considered that. ☺  “Rule 10: No player shall be permitted to cause the lava in Pain Water in his or her lane to turn into obsidian, either by placing/removing blocks in that area, or through any other means. It is intended for a player to peek into the center void lane for air in order to complete this obstacle.”   I feel that the map design and other rules make it fairly obvious that that’s how one progresses through Painwater, and I’m concerned that the inclusion of this piece of information might unnecessarily dilute the more important information in these rules, reducing its prominence.   If you feel that it’s important to let players know that they can partially exit their lane in order for their characters to breath while traversing Painwater within these rules, I would suggest that you convey that information by implying it in the context of an example you give in Rule 3 to clarify a broader principle, so that you’re essentially hitting two birds with one stone. It could be an additional line at the end of Rule 3 that reads as follows:  “It should be emphasized that this rule applies to any and all situations in which a competitor completely exits their lane for even a fraction of a second, including, but not limited to instances in which they move so far out of the water in Pain Water while refilling their air bar that they temporary enter a state of freefall.”",☺

t5_2qh1i,poteaser,1322843794,"How Could You? By Jim Willis, ©2001   When I was a puppy, I entertained you with my antics and made you laugh. You called me your child, and despite a number of chewed shoes and a couple of murdered throw pillows, I became your best friend.   Whenever I was ""bad,"" you'd shake your finger at me and ask ""How could you?"" -- but then you'd relent and roll me over for a belly rub. My housebreaking took a little longer than expected, because you were terribly busy, but we worked on that together. I remember those nights of nuzzling you in bed and listening to your confidences and secret dreams, and I believed that life could not be any more perfect.   We went for long walks and runs in the park, car rides, stops for ice cream (I only got the cone because ""ice cream is bad for dogs"" you said), and I took long naps in the sun waiting for you to come home at the end of the day.   Gradually, you began spending more time at work and on your career, and more time searching for a human mate. I waited for you patiently, comforted you through heartbreaks and disappointments, never chided you about bad decisions, and romped with glee at your homecomings, and when you fell in love.   She, now your wife, is not a ""dog person"" -- still I welcomed her into our home, tried to show her affection, and obeyed her. I was happy because you were happy.   Then the human babies came along and I shared your excitement. I was fascinated by their pinkness, how they smelled, and I wanted to mother them, too. Only she and you worried that I might hurt them, and I spent most of my time banished to another room, or to a dog crate. Oh, how I wanted to love them, but I became a ""prisoner of love.""   As they began to grow, I became their friend. They clung to my fur and pulled themselves up on wobbly legs, poked fingers in my eyes, investigated my ears, and gave me kisses on my nose. I loved everything about them and their touch -- because your touch was now so infrequent -- and I would've defended them with my life if need be. I would sneak into their beds and listen to their worries and secret dreams, and together we waited for the sound of your car in the driveway.   There had been a time, when others asked you if you had a dog, that you produced a photo of me from your wallet and told them stories about me. These past few years, you just answered ""yes"" and changed the subject. I had gone from being ""your dog"" to ""just a dog,"" and you resented every expenditure on my behalf.   Now, you have a new career opportunity in another city, and you and they will be moving to an apartment that does not allow pets. You've made the right decision for your ""family,"" but there was a time when I was your only family.   I was excited about the car ride until we arrived at the animal shelter. It smelled of dogs and cats, of fear, of hopelessness. You filled out the paperwork and said ""I know you will find a good home for her."" They shrugged and gave you a pained look. They understand the realities facing a middle-aged dog, even one with ""papers.""   You had to pry your son's fingers loose from my collar as he screamed, ""No, Daddy! Please don't let them take my dog!"" And I worried for him, and what lessons you had just taught him about friendship and loyalty, about love and responsibility, and about respect for all life.   You gave me a good-bye pat on the head, avoided my eyes, and politely refused to take my collar and leash with you. You had a deadline to meet and now I have one, too. After you left, the two nice ladies said you probably knew about your upcoming move months ago and made no attempt to find me another good home. They shook their heads and asked ""How could you?""   They are as attentive to us here in the shelter as their busy schedules allow. They feed us, of course, but I lost my appetite days ago. At first, whenever anyone passed my pen, I rushed to the front, hoping it was you that you had changed your mind -- that this was all a bad dream...or I hoped it would at least be someone who cared, anyone who might save me.   When I realized I could not compete with the frolicking for attention of happy puppies, oblivious to their own fate, I retreated to a far corner and waited. I heard her footsteps as she came for me at the end of the day, and I padded along the aisle after her to a separate room. A blissfully quiet room.   She placed me on the table and rubbed my ears, and told me not to worry. My heart pounded in anticipation of what was to come, but there was also a sense of relief. The prisoner of love had run out of days.   As is my nature, I was more concerned about her. The burden which she bears weighs heavily on her, and I know that, the same way I knew your every mood. She gently placed a tourniquet around my foreleg as a tear ran down her cheek. I licked her hand in the same way I used to comfort you so many years ago.   She expertly slid the hypodermic needle into my vein. As I felt the sting and the cool liquid coursing through my body, I lay down sleepily, looked into her kind eyes and murmured ""How could you?"" Perhaps because she understood my dogspeak, she said ""I'm so sorry."" She hugged me, and hurriedly explained it was her job to make sure I went to a better place, where I wouldn't be ignored or abused or abandoned, or have to fend for myself --a place of love and light so very different from this earthly place.   And with my last bit of energy, I tried to convey to her with a thump of my tail that my ""How could you?"" was not directed at her. It was directed at you, My Beloved Master, I was thinking of you. I will think of you and wait for you forever. May everyone in your life continue to show you so much loyalty.",©

Sea Foam® will slowly re-liquefy the varnish and gum deposits that hold carbon together.  To remove carbon and varnish deposits more quickly, Sea Foam® can be induced directly into the combustion chamber via the following method. With the engine warmed up and running, SLOWLY POUR 1/3 to ½ can of Sea Foam® down the carburetor throat or into any main manifold vacuum line that DISTRIBUTES EVENLY TO ALL CYLINDERS. Note that some newer induction systems, like those found on Vortec and Subaru “H” style engines, do not have any vacuum line that distribute evenly. Consequently, this process should only be attempted by technicians with a comprehensive understanding of the engine’s induction system or use Sea Foam® Spray through the throttle body (discribed in a different section of this web site).  Once the product has been applied, turn off the engine and allow the Sea Foam® to heat soak for a minimum of 10 minutes. At this time, Sea Foam® will dissolve the varnish deposits that hold carbon together. After allowing the Sea Foam® to soak, restart the engine in a WELL VENTILATED AREA as exhaust will be extreme for a short time. Drive aggressively for 2 to 5 miles to allow all the atomized carbon to be safely expelled from the system.  REPEAT Sea Foam® TREATMENT AS NECESSARY.",®

In addition, vibration actuator has been incorporated into the mobile devices, because haptic information coupled with visual information can increase the sense of reality and excitation. Accordingly, many haptic researchers have focused on generating haptic sensation using a commercial eccentric vibration motor [1-4]. Immersion Corporation developed the VibTonz ® system to generate several vibrotactile sensations using an eccentric vibration motor [5]. However, there was a limitation to create various tactile sensations because of the slow response rate.  &gt; &gt; To overcome the limitation, various vibration actuators have been developed. Ivan Poupyrev et al. proposed TouchEngine actuator using PZT ceramic for a small hand-held computing device [6]. Although this actuator has fast response time and can generate various haptic patterns, it is too fragile to be embedded into the mobile devices and controller of the piezo actuator is quite heavy. Linear Resonance Actuator (LRA) was developed by Samsung Electro-Mechanics using a solenoid, a permanent magnet, and an elastic spring [7]. To improve the response rate of the vibration actuator, the LRA uses linear actuation. In addition, The LRA uses resonant frequency to amplify the vibration strength. The structure of the LRA is durable, and its size is small enough to be inserted into the mobile devices. Hence, the LRA has been widely commercialized in mobile devices. However, when the LRA generates vibration, the vibration contains unexpected aftershocks. This problem usually happens in open-loop system. A feed-back controller can solve this problem by reducing unexpected vibration. Therefore, this paper proposes the smart actuator with feedback function. The proposed smart actuator combines actuator and sensor in small size.  The one in the paper is clever - they use a solenoid to generate the vibration and a piezoelectric crystal as a sensor. So you have closed loop control. Mind you I can imagine this would be less ""throaty"" and more ""hollow"" than the old school technique.  I knew about the eccentric motor technique - that's been around for ages. But the LRA stuff is new to me.  I hate haptic feedback myself - I always turn it off - and just want something where I won't miss texts when it is set on vibrate. So probably I'd prefer the old technique.",®

t5_2qh9z,1whhiteduck,1322960239,"I recently sent the following letter to my physician. Thought it might shed a little light on this badly neglected issue:  Dear Dr. Jones,     On December 1, 2011, my wife and I brought our 4 year old daughter Angela in for a checkup. Fortunately, she is in excellent health but she did need to update her immunizations. In the past, when we were residing overseas, Angie’s vaccinations were administered by Dr. Torres who managed to distract Angie and perform the vaccinations so quickly that there was only momentary trauma after the fact.       Her experience at your clinic was quite different. There was much more overt discussion about the upcoming injections, and the fact that another individual was being brought in to “do the hard stuff” as you put it, created more drama and ultimately trauma for Angie. When your assistant came in, I could see Angie’s anxiety accelerating and the fact that she was allowed to see the syringes, in my opinion greatly exacerbated her apprehension.      Fortunately, the flu vaccine was administered in the form of an inhalant but when it came time for the needles, Angie had a complete breakdown. The magnitude of her distress was alarmingly high and as one who has suffered from trypanophobia all my life, I understand the panic she was feeling at that moment.      The attendant attempted to cajole her in to submitting to the procedure(s) but she was completely overcome with fear and was screaming to go home. There was no way to defuse the situation through rational discussion.      In the end, my wife was instructed to physically restrain my daughter while the injections were administered. After we left it was clear that my daughter was still deeply traumatized and she continued to cry for an hour or more afterwards. Since then, she has approached me repeatedly voicing her dread of future vaccinations.     In looking back on the incident, I wonder whether you feel that it was handled in the best possible way. It is not my intent to criticize but I am curious about your philosophy and approach to matters like this. I cannot help but feel that restraining her was not the best choice and I am concerned about the potential psychological impact of such a personal violation. Moving forward, I am hoping that we can agree on an approach that better suit Angie’s needs.     As I’m sure you are aware, trypanophobia is one of the most common phobias and may result in serious physiological and physical responses. More often, it leads the sufferer to avoid all medical care, thus endangering the health of that individual. I am convinced that my daughter shares this affliction with me as approximately 80% of trypanophobes report that a relative within the first degree exhibits the same disorder.     There are products on the market that can help trypanophobic patients cope. One of the most effective steps in overcoming severe needle phobia is to anesthetize the site of the needle stick with the goal of temporarily blocking the needle puncture signals to the brain. A topical anesthesia can eliminate this sensation of being stuck by a needle.     The Synera® topical patch is approved in the United States to provide local dermal analgesia for superficial venous access and I would appreciate it if you would prescribe it for Angela’s next vaccination in hopes that we can diminish her fears and help her to overcome her trypanophobia. I’m sure that you will agree that this is a very worthwhile goal as it will help her to feel more confident as she addresses her healthcare needs in the future.  Thank you,   Hope this helps. ",®

While I accumulate the funds to buy a power cage, as an alternative I do front squats with dumbbells rested on my shoulders. How good / bad are these front squats compared to your regular barbell squats?  To me front squats always appear to be a more intense version of the barbell squat, they seem to recruit much the same muscles as a barbell squat. The biggest difference is that front squats are 'harder', and adding weight is much slower than on a program with barbell squats. I got this impression you don't particularly like front squats....why is that?  * That lower back soreness caused by heavy squatting and deadlifting. I've found that hanging from a pull-up bar after exercise helps in 'decompressing' the spine and reduces the soreness. What do you recommend for lower back soreness?   * People recommend program X or program Y after one is done with starting strength. In your considerable experience, have you come across people who intentionally decide to stall at certain weights, and keep following Starting Strength program forever? Is there anything wrong with this approach if one is only interested in maintaining strength and overall fitness, not bodybuilding? Do such individuals pay a heavy penalty on joint wear? I am mostly worried about my knees.  * Sex and masturbation. This might sound silly, but I ask in all seriousness. Many people on the net (including myself) are convinced ejaculating makes a man weaker. To the extent many forums and online communities have this online pledge system [No fap November, and so on (fap is euphemism for masturbation)]. In your opinion should one minimize -if not abstain- from sexual activity while seriously training? Does it have any benefits?  ",☺

t5_2fwo,Rhomboid,1323267554,"I was a little surprised by the file hiding issue, so I had to do a little experimentation.  Apparently, if your locale is set to C aka POSIX, and python3 encounters a filename with unrepresentable bytes, and you've requested filenames as Unicode (i.e. you didn't pass a byte string to the function), then you get this weird thing where you get back a Unicode string with the unrepresentable bytes mapped into the Low Surrogates range (i.e. U+DC00 - U+DCFF).      $ touch ""$(PYTHONIOENCODING=utf8 python -c 'print u""snowman.\N{SNOWMAN}""')""          $ ls -l snowman*     -rw-rw-r-- 1 user user 0 2011-12-07 05:28 snowman.☃          $ python3 -c 'import os; print(os.listdir("".""))'     ['snowman.☃']          $ LC_ALL=C python3 -c 'import os; print(os.listdir("".""))'     ['snowman.\udce2\udc98\udc83']  I guess this was meant to make it possible to work with files with names of unknown/indeterminate encoding when the locale doesn't specify, since this mapping apparently works both ways -- you can pass this weird flavor of Unicode-but-not-really string as a filename and it will map it back to bytes if the locale is C/POSIX:      $ LC_ALL=C python3 -c 'import os; print(os.stat(""snowman.\udce2\udc98\udc83""))'     posix.stat_result(st_mode=33204, st_ino=1060099, st_dev=2049, st_nlink=1, st_uid=1000, st_gid=1000, st_size=0, st_atime=1323264513, st_mtime=1323264513, st_ctime=1323265055)  However, if you try to actually do anything with this string -- such as display it or write it over a network protocol -- you're pretty much fucked, because it's not a byte string so you can't decode it as utf-8, but it's not a real Unicode string either, so you can't print it:      $ python3 -c 'print(""snowman.\udce2\udc98\udc83"")'     Traceback (most recent call last):       File ""&lt;string&gt;"", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;     UnicodeEncodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't encode character '\udce2' in position 8: surrogates not allowed  It seems like the python people feel that you're meant to bite the bullet and use byte strings when working on \*nix systems, since that is not locale dependent:      $ LC_ALL=C python3 -c 'import os; print(os.listdir(b"".""))'     [b'snowman.\xe2\x98\x83']          $ python3 -c 'import os; print(os.listdir(b"".""))'     [b'snowman.\xe2\x98\x83']  But this of course then requires you to manually encode/decode filenames as UTF-8 for display or use in protocols.  So it would appear that when dealing with \*nix systems^[1] you have to choose the least-worst of:  1. Always check the locale setting at startup and complain/die if it's not set to UTF-8. 2. If you just want to read/write the contents of exiting files based entirely on tree traversal but never display filenames and never use user input to select files or otherwise filter the traversal, you can ignore the locale setting and just plow on ahead and let the surrogate-mapped strings do their thing.  (The number of real-world programs that can assume this is probably vanishingly close to nil.) 3. Always use the byte form of all file APIs and do manual conversion of filenames to and from UTF-8.  That's pretty sucky, python.  [1] This of course assumes that you expect/assume everything on your filesystem to be encoded with UTF-8, which hopefully is a sane assumption in this day and age.  Hopefully you're not going to try to support filenames in non-Unicode encodings like 8859 or whatnot.",☃

t5_2r3gv,Tarkaan,1323428057,"  “There was one subroutine called Psychologist and one subroutine called Loop Expert and one subroutine called Domain Expert, and so forth,” Lenat said. “There were maybe a hundred of these little beings altogether. You’d post a problem and one of them would recognize it and broadcast to the whole community a set of requests for what needed to get done in order to solve it. And anyone who—any being who could recognize any of those requests would respond to it, process it, and broadcast requests of what it needed to have done…That succeeded pretty well…One of the tasks we applied the program to was synthesizing Patrick Winston’s thesis.”  For his doctoral dissertation, Winston, who now heads the artificial intelligence laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, wrote a program—one of the classics in the field—that could learn to recognize simple block configurations, like arches. After being presented with samples of what is and is not an arch, the program would construct an internal model of the concept and use it to judge future examples.  First, Lenat wrote the dialogue his beings would engage in if they were writing Winston’s program. (The beings included one called User, the human running the program, who could be called on occasionally to supply information or resolve disputes.)  “For each Being we had a list of the very specific facts that it needed to know. And I coded them up and now we had this system that carried out the original dialogue perfectly. Each expert that was just the right expert came in at just the right time—it was spectacular, and, sure enough, Winston’s thesis program came out as the end product. And it was great—except it couldn’t do anything else.”  The program’s knowledge was too specific to apply to other tasks.  “Of all the 500,000 things that a psychologist might know we only put down that it had to know the ten things that it had to know in order to do Winston’s thesis program. And so if you asked anything else, and a psychologist should have responded, this one wouldn’t, because it didn’t know that. And so I was very depressed because on the one hand I’d succeeded with this massive goal, but on the other hand I hadn’t really learned anything. And the reason was that having a very specific target, knowing where you want to go, makes it too easy to get there…So I said, Okay, let’s try and design a program that doesn’t know where it’s going…And the idea of mathematics research came to me as the archetypal case where you’re playing around with concepts and you don’t really have any particular goal in mind…And so I said, Okay, fine, we’ll write down ahead of time all the knowledge that’s reasonable to know to guide a researcher in elementary mathematics. And then we’ll set the program loose and we won’t add to it or do anything to it and just see where it goes, and that will be the experiment.”  Johnson02.jpg A simplified version of Eurisko’s concept of Energy Gun.  (Adapted from Douglas B. Lenat, “EURISKO: A Program That Learns New Heuristics and Domain Concepts,” published in volume 21 of Artificial Intelligence journal, 1883.)  * * *  Lenat called his new program AM, for Automated Mathematician. For the next several months he coded into it knowledge about set theory, a very abstract and basic discipline that forms the infrastructure of mathematics. A set is simply a collection of objects(A,B,C,D), for example. It doesn’t matter what the letters represent: rocks, cars, people, galaxies. A set is an abstraction, and set theory is the science describing the behavior of this pure mindstuff.  For AM to understand set theory it had to know about such fundamental notions as equality (when two sets are identical), union (when two sets are combined to form a third set) and intersection (when the members that two sets have in common are used to form a third set). Lenat included 115 such concepts in AM, along with several hundred heuristics that captured some of the rudiments of mathematical discovery and aesthetics. One heuristic, for example, said that a good way to start exploring a concept is to find examples of it. Another said that if a concept has few examples, try creating a new, more general version of it.  Guided by such rules, AM conducted hundreds of experiments in set theory, modifying and combining ideas until new ones evolved like crystals growing in a supersaturated solution. In this way, the program chanced upon the concept of natural numbers, which enabled it to discover arithmetic. The concept of union led to that of addition; addition led to multiplication, which led to exponentiation.  One heuristic advised AM to study the inverse of interesting functions. Thus, AM turned multiplication into the concept of divisors. By applying a heuristic that suggested looking for extreme examples, it found numbers that have only two divisors: the primes. Once AM knew about primes it was only a matter of time before it created versions of such famous mathematical ideas as Goldbach’s conjecture (every even number greater than two is the sum of two primes) and the fundamental theorem of arithmetic: any number can be factored into a unique set of primes.  “AM went off and discovered hundreds of things,” Lenat said, “about half of which were useful and half of which were sort of weird and probably losers.” But, after its first 200 discoveries, AM began to run dry.  “It started doing silly things, one after another, like defining numbers that were both odd and even…or other just awful stuff that doesn’t exist, or of which there is only one.” The percentage of good concepts—the “hit rate,” as Lenat called it—dropped from 62.5% to less than 10%.  As the conceptual world AM was building grew increasingly complex, Lenat realized, the heuristics he had provided it were becoming inadequate. They had been written to deal with sets, not arithmetic and number theory. To test his hypothesis, Lenat added some new heuristics, raising the hit rate slightly.  Johnson03.jpg How the concept of prime numbers looks to Lenat’s Automated Mathematician.  (Adapted from Douglas B. Lenat, “The Nature of Heuristics,” published in volume 19 of Artificial Intelligence journal, 1982.)  * * *  Then he had an insight that led to the invention of Eurisko: Heuristics, like any other concept, could be coded in the system as boxes with slots. By giving the program access to its own heuristics, it could experiment with them, gathering data, analyzing pattems-helping them evolve to keep pace with the expanding conceptual realm. Heuristics could be applied to heuristics. The rules about when to specialize or generalize mathematical concets, or when to raise or lower their worth, or combine them to form new ideas-all could be applied to this new domain of learning how to make better discoveries.  When AM was accepted as Lenat’s doctoral dissertation in 1976, he was already at work on Eurisko.  So far, the program’s most profitable success has been in Traveller, but Lenat has found his system to be general enough to make discoveries-and discoveries about discoveries-in many domains. When loosed upon the field of microscopic circuitry design, Eurisko discovered a new configuration for a memory cell, which might, however be of limited use since, Lenat wrote, “the cell can be realized most efficiently on the surface of a Mobius strip.” By giving Eurisko a set of concepts about LISPthe language in which it is written-it was able to modify parts of itself to make them more efficient.  But as with any program, there are always bugs to work out. Sometimes a “mutant” heuristic appears that does little more than continually cause itself to be triggered, creating within the program an infinite loop. During one run, Lenat noticed that the number in the Worth slot of one newly discovered heuristic kept rising, indicating that Eurisko had made a particularly valuable find. As it turned out the heuristic performed no useful function. It simply examined the pool of new concepts, located those with the highest Worth values, and inserted its name in their My Creator slots.  It was a heuristic that, in effect, had learned how to cheat.  ©1984 George Johnson  George Johnson, a freelance writer, is reporting on the quest to build computers smarter than humans.",©

Saying ""bless you"" when you sneeze gets a ""Fuck you, I'm an Atheist®"", as well as a ""Merry Christmas"", or a ""Dear Lord"". There's mass defacement of currency being cheered on and lauded. That's not a response to malignant ideology, it's just a reflex reaction tantamount to a childish bout, to anything you disagree with, and that's exactly what that subreddit is promoting, the immature and self righteous mistreatment of people with beliefs different than yours. But you know what? It's only snot nosed 15 year old brats that like or agree with the shallow minded bullshit that gets posted in that dump, so I'm going to assume that's what you are, and I seriously doubt I'm wrong.

t5_2qmg3,Kinetic_Static,1323482689,"&gt;you shouldn't point out hyperbole as it isn't a fallacy.    It definitely conflates prepositions, and while that doesn't necessarily make it false, it complicates the proof. More often than not people use hyperbole to transition to an argument that people are familiar with (like you did) and then abandon the original premises(which you didn't).   Identifying hyperbole is perfectly acceptable in a debate, because it signifies a departure from logic. Hyperbole has no place in logical arguments :      ( n ↔ h ) ⊃ (( n &amp; h ) || ( !n &amp; !h ))   So, yes hyperbole isn't a fallacy as it isn't an appeal to logic. But if one tries to use it in a logical argument, or if it is a distraction, it's perfectly acceptable to call out.  Just my 2 cents.",↔

t5_2qh68,sandstars,1323543696,"Directly from Visa Debit card page   **TL;DR- It works like a *check* that's ""backed (in cases of theft or loss)"" by Visa like a credit card would be.  Unlike a check, it comes out pretty much instantaneously out of your bank acct.  Unlike a credit card, if you don't have the money in the bank acct, you can't use the card.**   A Visa Debit card, also known as a Visa check card, is a debit card that works like a check, only better. When you make purchases, the amount is deducted directly from your checking account — but you also enjoy added convenience and security protections.  Easier Than Cash And Checks Just use your Visa Debit card when you are ready to pay. It works fast, so there's no need to write checks or fumble for change. Plus, you'll save on trips to the ATM and can leave your checkbook at home.  It's Everywhere You Want To Be® Because it's accepted at millions of places worldwide, you can use it for nearly anything, including:  Monthly bills Dining Fast food Retail merchandise Groceries Movie tickets Prescriptions Gas and automotive services Internet/online purchases Phone orders Improve your money management with an up-to-date balance and transaction history. Debit card transactions are automatically deducted from your checking account and typically posted within 24 hours of your purchase. So you can check your updated balance and transaction record on your card issuer's website or by phone.  In addition, every month you'll also receive a checking account statement that details your purchases, including merchant name, location, date and amount. So it's easy to see where your money goes.  Gain peace of mind with Visa's extra security protections. When you sign for your purchases, your money comes directly from your checking account, but you also get security protections that help prevent, detect and resolve fraud, including:  Visa's Zero Liability Policy*, which protects you from unauthorized charges. Any funds taken from your account due to fraudulent use will be returned to you. Continuous fraud monitoring to detect and prevent suspicious activity on your debit card Access to Identity Theft Assistance to help you recover your identity and prevent further problems A 3-digit security code to verify your identity for Internet and phone purchases. Enjoy 3 ways to pay with Visa® Debit ... 1. Sign for purchases To ensure your purchase is protected, tell the cashier you want to sign for your purchase. Or, if there’s a PIN pad, swipe your card, press “credit” and sign. There’s no need to enter your PIN. You’ll be protected by Visa’s Zero Liability policy* and earn rewards if your card offers them. 2. PIN for cash back If you want cash back (at certain merchants), simply tell the cashier how much or, if there’s a PIN pad, swipe your card, press “debit” and enter your PIN.  3. Purchases without a signature or PIN For many purchases of $25 or less you may not be asked to sign the receipt or enter your PIN. In these environments, your purchase — even if it’s a $2 cup of coffee — is still protected from fraudulent activity and you’ll earn rewards if your card offers them.  You'll receive these same security protections when you use your Visa Debit card for online, phone and mail orders or for purchases at merchants that do not require a signature.  Earn rewards just by using your card. All Visa Debit cardholders can reward themselves by shopping and saving with merchant discounts just for Visa cardholders.  Some Visa Debit cards also offer rewards, like Visa Extras. With these cards, you get rewarded for all of your purchases — like paying bills, buying groceries and picking up your morning coffee. Contact your Visa Debit card issuer for rewards program details.",®

t5_2qh2p,efrique,1323657382,"The common ancestor of humans, bonobos and chimps had 24 pairs of chromosomes.   Normally chromosomes have a particular region in the middle called a centromere, and special bits at each end called telomeres, which are a bit like the ends on shoelaces, and for a similar purpose.  We lost one pair when two ancestor chromosomes fused; [human Chromosome 2 has *two* separate centromeres and has *telomeres in between*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome_2_%28human%29). We can see that there were two chromosomes that at some point became joined together.  [wikipedia: The genetic structure of all the great apes is similar. Chromosomes 6, 13, 19, 21, 22, and X are structurally the same in all great apes. 3, 11, 14, 15, 18, and 20 match between gorillas, chimpanzees, and humans. Chimps and humans match on 1, 2p, 2q, 5, 7–10, 12, 16, and Y as well. Some older references will include Y as a match between gorillas, chimps, and humans, but chimpanzees (including bonobos) and humans have recently been found to share a large transposition from chromosome 1 to Y that is not found in other apes.^[4] ]  We can match up our chromosomes one-for-one with chimp chromosomes; they're very similar. Except, for our chromosome 2, two of their chromosomes match up, one with one part, another with the other part.  **Major edit** (I started out making a little addition, and got caught up):  As far as the various skulls go, take a look the image here (one I generated myself, but you can find the same information in published scientific papers - the source of the data is given on the linked page):  http://ecstathy.blogspot.com/2010/04/human-brain-evolution-clear-kink.html  Each little circle there represents a fossil, going back not quite 2 million years. On the x-axis ""&lt;--&gt;"" is time, with today (0 years ago) at the right end and about 1.8 million years ago at the left end. On the y-axis (↕) is brain volume (measured by the available volume for brain inside the skull).  You can clearly see the changing brain size over time. This involves a fairly dramatic change.  We diverged from the last human-chimp-bonobo common ancestor somewhere roughly around 5-7 million years ago -- that graph only shows skulls from genus *Homo*, which is only from the most recent third of that. If we track back further - including the Australopithecines, we see this:  http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2006/09/fun-with-homini-1.html  (the orange green and blue are nearly all the same points as in my data, the additional red points are Australopithecines.)  Chimpanzee skulls are 300-500 cc's, almost coincident with the early Australopithecines. Bonobos are 300-400ccs.  Early hominins from around the time of Pan-Homo divergence also have brain sizes not far from that. E.g. *Ardipithecus ramidus* has a brain size around 300-350 cm^3  (though *ramidus* is on the scene nearly a million years too late to be a direct ancestor of humans).   So from the early Australopithecines 3.25 million years ago human ancestors (or their near relatives) start out with a brain size about the same size as we find for hominins near the divergence time, and about the same size as modern chimps and bonobos. By 2 million years ago, Australopithecines have a brain size that is substantially bigger - quite similar to Homo habilis around 1.8 mya. Then we get to the rapid growth in brain size through various Homo species until we get to modern humans - who actually have slightly *smaller* brains than humans 50 thousand years ago. (Evolution goes both ways! sometimes things get bigger, sometimes they get smaller) ",↕

So if you focus with him on really really careful alignment it should be just fine to do those poses with him. I wouldn't suggest all out avoidance of the poses (yet), but on modifying/adjusting to make the poses accessible to him with things that make the pose more stable like a block, the wall, or partners.  If it IS a cramp situation - since it's from the same poses all the time where the hip is in flexion I'd bet he's letting his hip flexors do all the work in those poses and it's just getting overworked. So then you could just work more on what pieces to soften and what pieces to let do the work 'cause the hip flexors do tend to try and steal the show, but in the long run it'll just make them tighter and lead to more hip/low back pain. Oh yeah and strengthening the legs/feet/core bc a lack of ease there would likely be why he'd be compensating with his hips.

Thank you for listening to me at 3 in the morning when I make no sense and think I'm a bird. Thank you for telling me I'm pretty every day.

Thanks for that period of time early on when I couldn't drive and you'd take me everywhere. Thanks for trying to teach me Physics. Thanks for letting me win video games, and appreciating my sense of humor, and ostracizing anyone who's mean to me. Thanks for listening through my club music playlist even though you hate pop. Thank you for my Christmas presents last year.  The list goes on, but I just wanted to get the chance to say thank you (which is the opposite of what I tell you most of the time).

t5_2t5x7,kduluth,1323756337,"Italian Buttercream Meringue Frosting Ingredients      4 sticks (1 pound) unsalted butter, slightly soft     1 cup Crisco® shortening     8 large egg whites ***     1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar     1/2 cup sugar     2 teaspoon clear, pure or powdered vanilla     1 cup sugar     1/4 cup water  Instructions      In a mixer, or by hand, beat butter and shortening together until smooth. Set aside in a cool area (68º F).      Combine egg whites and cream of tartar in large mixing bowl. Whip on a low medium until frothy. When white color is constant, slowly add 1/2 cup of sugar in a very fine stream. Continue to beat on medium.     While egg whites are beating, combine 1 cup of sugar and water in a small saucepan. Stir until dissolved, cook over medium heat until boiling. Cook to 250º F, as measured with a Candy Thermometer.     If egg whites haven’t yet reached a shiny, but softly stiff stage, turn them up onto high to finish beating. If whites reach shiny/soft/stiff stage before sugar syrup is ready, reduce speed to stir and keep mixing until syrup is ready. Increase speed of mixture. Pour a Tablespoon of syrup into whites (stay away from pouring them onto whip), beat for 10 seconds, continue until all of syrup is used. Beat meringue until bottom of bowl has cooled to about 98°. You want the meringue to return to a stiff/shiny peak before adding the butter mixture. This will make a more stable buttercream.     Using paddle, add butter, one heaping tablespoon at a time allowing mixture to mix for 10-15 seconds between additions. Continue until all butter is mixed in. If mixture breaks, continue beating at low-medium speed and mixture will come back together. Cool for about an hour in a cool area before using. Use immediately.     NOTE: For a sweeter tasting Italian Meringue Buttercream, beat in 1 cups of sifted powdered sugar in the end.      You can refrigerate it for a week, or freeze for several months. Be sure to allow the buttercream to come to room temperature, then whip it with an electric mixer on medium speed until it is once again thick, smooth, and shiny and returns to its original volume.      ***Because much of the syrup’s heat is lost to the bowl…the foam mass normally gets no hotter than 130 or 135 degrees F, which is insufficient to kill salmonella. You can use powdered pasteurized egg whites to make the Italian Meringue Buttercream if you are concerned.  ",®

Here's the full, unedited video: http://onegoodmovemedia.org/movies/0712/ronpaul_evolution.mov  Someone else put together a lengthy response to the whole 'evolution' debacle a long time ago: http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/efnii/ron_paul_wikileaks_in_a_free_society_we_are/c17s9cv  Basically, I believe at the time of the video, he was confusing evolution with abiogenesis.  From his latest book:  &gt;No one person has perfect knowledge as to man's emergence on this earth. Yet almost everyone has a strong religious, scientific, or emotional opinion he or she considers gospel. The creationists frown on the evolutionists, and the evolutionists dismiss the creationists as kooky and unscientific. Lost in this struggle are those who look objectively at the scientific evidence for evolution without feeling any need to reject the notion of an all-powerful, all-knowing Creator. My personal view is that recognizing the validity of the evolutionary process does not support atheism nor should it diminish one's view about God and the universe.  Make fun of him for being a creationist, but don't mindlessly repeat that he doesn't believe in the process of evolution. He tries to avoid alienating his fundamentalist supporters by not coming out and saying ""I ♥ evolution"", so instead he just says that you can be a creationist and still believe in evolution.",♥

t5_2cneq,bdirnbac,1323956330,"http://robertreich.org/: November 18, 2011 Stop the Austerity Train Wreck! Robert Reich   The biggest question right now on Planet Washington is whether the congressional supercommittee will reach an agreement.  That’s the wrong question. Agreement or not, Washington is  on the road to making budget cuts that will slow the economy, increase unemployment, and impose additional hardship on millions of Americans.    The real question is how to stop this austerity train wreck, and substitute the following:   FIRST: no cuts before jobs are back – until unemployment is down to 5 percent. Until then, the economy needs a boost, not a cut. Consumers – whose spending is 70 percent of the economy – don’t have the money to boost the economy on their own. Their pay is dropping and they’re losing jobs.    SECOND: Make the boost big enough. 14 million Americans are out of work, and 10 million are working part time who need full-time jobs. The President’s proposed jobs program is a start but it’s tiny relative to what needs to be done. It would create fewer than 2 million jobs. We need a big jobs program – rebuilding America’s crumbling infrastructure, and including a WPA and Civilian Conservation Corps.  THIRD: To pay for this, raise taxes on the super-rich. It’s only fair. Never before has so much income and wealth been concentrated at the very top, and taxes on the top so low. Go back to the 70 percent marginal tax we had before 1980. And include more tax brackets at the top. It doesn’t make sense that any income over $375,000 is taxed at the same 35 percent, even if it’s a billion dollars. And tax all sources of income at the same rate, including capital gains.    FOURTH: Cut the budget where the real bloat is. Military spending and corporate welfare. End weapons systems that don’t work and stop wars we shouldn’t be fighting to begin with, and we save over $300 billion a year. Cut corporate welfare – subsidies and special tax breaks going to big agribusiness, big oil, big pharma, and big insurance – and we save another $100 billion.  Do you hear me, Washington? Do these four things and restore jobs and prosperity. Fail to do these, and you’ll make things much, much worse.  CHECK OUT: How to put America back to work By: Joseph E.

t5_2qhnf,kain099,1324027141,"When Buddha uses the word suffering, it isn't translatable in English. The first noble truth is best described as dukkha. Dukkha is an Indian word which can loosely be translated as suffering but is actually a really complex word which means ""suffering at all levels"".   Dukkha is getting to work late. Dukkha is getting cancer. Dukkha is getting a D on a test you worked hard for. Dukkha is the death of a loved one.   It encompasses suffering at all levels and all stages, death, illness, pain, sadness, depression, numbness. But it encompasses all ranges of these feelings, whether it be vexation for someone showing up late to your party or complete mental breakdown because you have lost everyone in your family.   I found a website which explains Dukkha as follows:     The First Noble Truth The Noble Truth of dukkha dukkha ariya sacca © 2005–2011 The definition  ""Now this, monks, is the Noble Truth of dukkha: Birth is dukkha, aging is dukkha, death is dukkha; sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, &amp; despair are dukkha; association with the unbeloved is dukkha; separation from the loved is dukkha; not getting what is wanted is dukkha. In short, the five clinging-aggregates are dukkha.""   ",©

Every time I played ranked games my team comp always had a lack of support champ OR someone was forced to play the support role and failed at it.  Then I decided to learn how to play support champs. I tried Taric, Soraka, Janna, Sona.... I failed hard on those. Then right after Leona's release I decided to test her as support. I was duolanning with a friend (normal game, not ranked), Leona/Ashe lane, and I was surprised to see how good Leona support was. Then I started to play her in rankeds. You have no idea how many times I was flamed in champ select for picking Leona until she became a ""popular"" support pick.  And nowadays 80% of the ranked games I play I rather play another role, but I have to play support every time because all other players can't.  I even try her in the jungle sometimes. She is slow but her ganks are DAMN worth.   ♥ Now I LOVE Leona, she is by far my most satisfying champ to play. ♥  (sorry for grammar mistakes, I'm a not native English speaker)",♥

This course introduces students to fundamental networking  concepts and technologies. The material in this course  encompasses a broad range of technologies that facilitate  how people work, live, play, and learn by communicating  with voice, video, and other data. First, you will examine  human versus network communication and see the parallels  between them. Next, you will be introduced to the two  major models used to plan and implement networks: OSI  and TCP/IP. You will gain an understanding of the “layered”  approach to networks and examine the OSI and TCP/IP  layers in detail to understand their functions and services.  You will become familiar with the various network devices,  network addressing schemes and, finally, the types of  media used to carry data across the network. In this course,  you will gain experience using networking utilities and  tools, such as Packet Tracer and Wireshark®, to explore  networking protocols and concepts. These tools will help  you to develop an understanding of how data flows in a  network. A special “model Internet” is also used to provide a  test environment where a range of network services and data  can be observed and analyzed. ",®

t5_2qo3d,robomekk,1324103274,"Here goes:  If you have a master link in the chain, take it off and keep it in a picket safely. Then shorten the chain to the necessary length, making sure you end on an ""inside"" link to which you can attach the quick link later. You will need to test multiple ratios in order to get this to work, otherwise the chain tension (or lack thereof) will not allow you to pedal; the chain will just skip. So try out different ratios, ideally keeping the chain as straight as possible, in order to find one where the chain can be kept taught. You can now re-insert the quick-link and check that the chain is tight enough to pedal. It should look something like [this](http://goar.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/jury-rigged-ss.jpg). You may need to use the large or small cog up front in order to get decent tension, but be careful what ratio you choose. You need a gear that you can ride home in; too high-walking up any hill or obstacle, overly difficult, too low-spinning along at 5 km/h, arrive home 17 hours late. This process will inherently work better on some bikes than others, simply due to chainstay length and sprocket sizes. When you are done this, before you ride, make sure that nothing can get caught in the spokes. The derailleur should be removed, and it's shifter cable tucked, tied or removed to keep it out of the way. This may or may not work for you, but it usually works well enough to get you home if you ride carefully and walk steeper hills.  If your chain does not have a quicklink, simply do as above, except you need to break the chain more carefully and reassemble it with the chain tool. Start breaking the chain, but be sure not to let the pin be pushed all the way out.  Advance the breaker by one turn at a time or less once it gets close. Wiggle the chain side to side while pulling (deflect it) to try to pull it out of the link. It should look something like [this](http://www.atomiczombie.com/home/chains/figure-05.jpg). If you screw this part up, you can always start from the other end, as you are pulling links out anyway☺. Now, before you try to find a ratio, you have to realize that you need to reconnect the chain ""inside"" link to ""outside"" link (the one with the pin still in one of the plates). Now you can find a ratio that fits, put the chain on and push the pin back in. The pin should be sticking a little bit past the outside of the plate, so you will need to lever the inside link into the gap. Once it is in (it should snap into place if you left a bit of it sticking out) you simply flip the chain tool around the opposite way to how it was facing before. You carefully push the pin back into the chain, making sure that nothing comes out of alignment. If it gets hard to push in, back off, rotate the link a bit to make sure everything is in place, and resume pushing it in. Once it is in, the chain will be tighter here (will not want to flex). You will probably need to grab the chain and flex it (the other direction from the way it normally bends) a few times with your hands. This will loosen up the link and help keep the chain running as smooth as possible.  Once you make it home, make sure your derailleur hanger is perfectly straight. Some people would recommend buying a new chain too, but you can probably put the old one back together if you have all the pieces/don't feel like spending the money.  Broken chains are also done similarly, just pull out he broken link and reattach the shortened chain sans one link.   Hope that helps. Next time you or your friend breaks a derailleur or chain, you should know how to fix it temporarily at least.   If you don't quite understand, I would be happy to help you more.     TL;DR Keep the master link; it makes things easier.",☺

t5_2qh5b,Bugsysservant,1324172898,"I should preface this by saying that I am in no way a modal logician so if someone wants to correct this, please feel free.  That said, in the context of ""possible world semantics"" (which is what we're both using and is generally accepted for modal logic), you're close with you're definitions, but are implicitly mixing them up with some axioms.  ""▆ P"" is define roughly as: ""relative to a particular world X, in all worlds which X is connected to via its accessibility relations, P is true""  Likewise, ""♦ P"" is defined as: ""relative to a particular world X, in at least one world which X is connected to via its accessibility relations, P is true""  ""Accessibility relation"" is typically ill-defined, but usually can be intuitively understand as the connection between worlds such that a statement that is true in one might be/have been true in another.  So saying ""▆ P"" might mean, in all worlds which are/have been possible relative to our own, P is true. If you let P mean, say, Plato is a woman, it is true that ~ ▆ P, however, it is probably true that ♦ P. Or, it isn't true that Plato is necessarily a woman, but he might have been.  Then you have the axioms to consider. There are a bunch of axiomatic frameworks for modal logic, so I'll just focus on the standard ones.  The first, usually called ""T"", is ▆ P =&gt; P, or, reflexivity. So a world is connected to itself via its own accessibility relation. Otherwise, you could have statements like ""Plato is necessarily a woman"" which might be true, even though Plato was male in our own world.  The second, usually called ""K"", is ▆ (P =&gt; Q) =&gt; (▆ P =&gt; ▆ Q). I'm not even sure if this one can be false in the context of many worlds semantics. Essentially, if an if/then statement is true in every world, and the antecedent is true, then the consequent is true in every world. Regardless, it is worth noting if we're being formal about it since it is required for axiomatic modal logic.  The third (S5 can have the next two simplified to a single axiom, but I think it's simpler to break it up to two parts for the purpose of an explanation), usually called ""4"", is ▆ P=&gt; ▆ ▆ P, or transitivity. This lets you move along accessibility relations. So, if in our world it is possible that Plato was a woman, and in the world where Plato was a woman it is possible that Charlemagne was a crocodile, it is possible in our world that Charlemagne was a crocodile. This is the point where things start to get controversial since not everyone will agree with this axiom.  The fourth, usually called ""B"" after the Dutch mathematician Brouwer, is P =&gt; ▆ ♦ P, or symmetry. Basically, if it is possible in our world that Plato was a woman, then it is also possible in the world where Plato was a woman that Plato was a man. This is a bit harder to see from the axiom, but trust me on this (if you're curious, Saul Kripke was the one who first came up with the equivalence between these axioms and their mathematical relational counterparts, so look up Kripke semantics for a more detailed explanation). Again, this one is also controversial, and rarely taken without also taking axiom 4.  If you combine these four axioms, you get the system known as ""S5"". As all accessibility relations are transitive, reflexive and symmetric, every world is connected to every other world. So, to finally get around to answering your question, yes, in the context of S5 saying ♦ P is equivalent to saying ""P is possible in at least one world"", but that usually isn't the case. Nor is it always accepted that it should be. One could imagine that, while it is possible that Plato was a woman in our world, and in the world where Plato is a woman it is possible that the earth never existed, and in the world where the earth never existed it is possible that charge of electrons was very slightly different, that the world where electrons have a different charge is so different from our own that it was never possible from our perspective. In this case, S5 couldn't hold because the relationships between worlds wouldn't be transitive. If this were true, you could say that ""♦ ♦ ♦ E"", or, ""it is possibly possibly possibly the case that electrons have a different charge"".  For a different example: in book 1 of Spinoza's *Ethics*, he argues that substance is necessary. However, he uses an argument that is predicated upon the existence of substance. So, substance has to exist, and necessarily has to exist, but there is no purely logical reason that substance has to exist. In this case, it might be the case that (♦ ▆ S) ^ ~ ( ▆  ▆ S). In other words, It is possible that substance necessarily exists, but it isn't necessarily the case that substance necessarily exists.  Anyway, sorry for the long-winded reply, but I hope that clears up any questions.  *TLDR*: The box and diamond of modal logic don't refer to all worlds, but rather worlds in relation to other worlds. You're implicitly combining the definitions of these operators with the axioms of S5, which is the reason it seems weird that you can have complex modalities (since S5 collapses modalities down to the far-right-most).",♦

The reviews turned out well, so I wanted to share them here.    I'm linking to their individual reviews as the original thread fell victim to a downvote brigade from another subreddit.  If you want to check out the full thread and don't mind uncollapsing everything, click [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/ms8sc/2_weeks_ago_i_gave_away_some_rocketfish_headsets/).  Otherwise, here are some highlights.. Be sure to click the links for the full reviews!   [http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/ms8sc/2_weeks_ago_i_gave_away_some_rocketfish_headsets/c33ft4o](Kung120): SRS® Wow enables the headset to provide even more amazing sound by enabling ""3d sound"", a feature that noticeably alters the sound output for games to add immersion quite unlike any headset I have experienced thus far.   [http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/ms8sc/2_weeks_ago_i_gave_away_some_rocketfish_headsets/c33fyqd](GnarShredd): Amazing sound quality that's crisp, clear, and covers a wide range. Extremely comfortable.  [http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/ms8sc/2_weeks_ago_i_gave_away_some_rocketfish_headsets/c33ibgz](Manacit): All in all, though, an extremely comfortable headset, I don't mind wearing it for five hours at a time when I switch from a BF3 binge to music and back again  [http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/ms8sc/2_weeks_ago_i_gave_away_some_rocketfish_headsets/c33iv9j](StarVixen): And the SRS 3D Sound made a huge difference that I never knew I was missing – wouldn’t want a headset without it from now on (and it’s nice that I can shut it off when necessary).  [http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/ms8sc/2_weeks_ago_i_gave_away_some_rocketfish_headsets/c33yn1z](kyren5058): There's a bass, volume and chat control as well as a mute-all mic that is definitely handy when playing a hectic match of BF3. The ability to switch mics from ear to ear is also something that I believed pushed this score from a fairly-good to great!  [http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/ms8sc/2_weeks_ago_i_gave_away_some_rocketfish_headsets/c347zfi](HaterTot): The modular design -- Flexibility is a wonderful thing. I will never expect less from any future gaming headset.  [http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/ms8sc/2_weeks_ago_i_gave_away_some_rocketfish_headsets/c35oeq4](Iamfivebears): The bass output is just the best of any pair of &lt; $100 headphones I've ever had. The in-line volume control is great, and the SRS ""3D Sound"" is incredibly interesting, though really only useful in certain situations (does almost nothing for Starcraft, but is very noticeable in Skyrim).  Still awaiting reviews from Shockwave3000, Rance_Geodes, and thorneyinak.. They may just end up commenting in this thread if they're still around.",®

t5_2qh1i,guitars_cadilacs_etc,1324323066,"&gt;Why do employers put down entry-level positions and then require 2+ years of experience?!  Because a lot of college graduates have *highly* unrealistic evaluations of their skills.   Many college grads have never been tested in the unforgiving Real World®. Many college grads have been the beneficiary of 4 or more years of ass-kissing professors in classes that don't start till noon. Thus, many college grads are shocked by what the Real World® expects of them. **SHOCKED**. And they sometimes have *hilarious* little tantrums when they hear their work wasn't good enough and they need to do it again.   So companies have learned the hard way that hiring a fresh grad is often like inviting a spoiled cousin to stay at your house for the summer: they eat all the food, make a mess, and start screaming like a baby when you ask them to wash their own dishes.   Practically, you need to get *any* job that'll hire you. Don't expect to get hired in something that's *exactly* what you studied. Then, work hard, don't complain, make a good impression and ask lots of questions. Make long-term plans to shift towards something more to your liking. ",®

[UI] 	- Change “Load Game” save sorting to be “Last Modified” by default.   	[BUGS] 	- When scrapping a unit, make sure any “cargo” units are scrapped as well. 	- When a unit is destroyed that is carrying another unit, make sure to kill both (missiles sometimes lingered). 	- Corrected a bug that was causing eliminated Civ’s to not generate notifications correctly. 	- Changed notification language for when a Research or Trade deal is cancelled due to the AI running out of funds to pay for it (per-turn deal), or are eliminated. It was currently displaying a “because of war” notification which is incorrect. 	- Corrected an issue that could cause unhappiness from city count and number of specialists to become incorrect over the course of a long game. 	- Changed Frigate obsolete tech to Combustion. 	- Fixed Korean science building exploit. 	- Fixed a problem with City Strike that gave the user the impression that they could not end their turn, when in reality, city strike was still active. 	- Crash: Fixed a crash that could occur in hot-seat when exiting to the main menu. 	- Crash: Fixed a crash that could occur when a unit was eliminated by standing too close to a Citadel.",®

Be extremely careful with this as it is the absolute strongest solution outside of industrial copper/brass tarnish remover. Once you're done you need to resurface/seal the cymbal. This will help keep if from tarnishing faster, and prolong the surface's life.  **Crazy John's Mean Clean® Formula Cymbal Cleaner**. It takes practice to use correctly, and if you're not careful will easily, easily strip any screen printing on the cymbal. It has (just like any tarnish remover) an abrasive chalky quality to it that polishes cymbals to a literal mirror finish. Its pretty easy to go overboard.  Once its polished seal it with something like **Paiste Cymbal Cleaner**. They may not make it the same way anymore, but if it has a viscus semi transparent milk like look to it, that what you're looking for. Go over it a second time, and go easy.  One of the best ways to keep they clean is to progressively clean them. That and using gloves (ugh). When you're done for the night, take a towel that has nothing on it. No oil, soap, polish, nothing, and wipe them down. I used to fold it over my middle finger and go over the whole cymbal. If you're worried about very tiny scratches (you will get scratches from a towel) either get a photographers microfiber lens cleaning cloth, or more practically an auto microfiber chamois.  I've experimented (see: done really stupid things) over the years, and using this technique with an electric buffer on a raw cymbal with no lathe marks, not only gave the cymbal perfect reflective surface, but brought out not normally seen hues in the surface. A platinum look.  Cymbals look gorgeous this way, but tragically sound awful. Good luck. ",®

Genetic approaches to complex traits such as personality have moved from single-gene models and methods to approaches that can identify genes of small effect size in multiple-gene systems called quantitative trait loci (QTLs). We review results for the association between dopamine D4 receptor (DRD4) and novelty seeking, which was the first QTL association reported for personality. The identification of QTLs will revolutionize genetic research on personality by providing measured genotypes for tracking the developmental course of genetic effects, for investigating genetic links between traits and between personality and biological mechanisms, and for identifying interactions and correlations between genes and environment. © 1998 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.

(they company claims they are more disease resistant, but this describes the farming technique not the fish.)  i've been reading the npr article, and it is agreeing with me on several points. so let me exaggerate.   the sterilization technique is not 100%. and even though there's always a chance some random chain of events caused a release (a tornado, an extreme rain event, a sinkhole into an underground river, aliens, barbarsol can egg safe) what will happen when these things are FDA approved is that there will eventually be large accidental releases of 99.99% sterile females. this fish is a product that will be licensed. the number of facilities will increase. people will desire the profits from this fish, that ""has the potential to grow to market size in half the time of conventional salmon""    people will not follow the rules, they will farm them on rivers in cages. their sterilization techniques will fail more often.  this is from the aquabounty website  Q. Can we be sure that AquAdvantage® Salmon will really be sterile?  A. Yes. There are specific tests to establish the effectiveness of our process to produce sterile fish. These tests will be performed on every commercial batch of fish to assure our product meets our specifications.  somehow i'm not convinced... i'm sure they are more worried about losing a fertile fish for financial/competitive/intellectual property reasons than they are about something being released into the wild to possibly affect nature.  this is also from their webpage http://www.aquabounty.com/images/Transgenic%20vs%20non-transgenic%20siblings%20CREDIT%20AquaBounty.jpg  their website sucks.  many of the answers they give to questions are lacking or arguable. they even take a bad tone in some.  they talk plenty about the chinook salmon gene, but not so much about the other modified gene (from a fish called an ocean pout).   i think aquaculture is good. i think a fish that grows huge really fast is exactly what you want.   but we have to make sure, no matter what, that it doesn't ever affect nature.     it would be the first transgenic animal with fda approval.  mad scientists all around the world will be working on products.

You wouldn't move invalid things around so validity should be preserved for free.  &gt; because of infix operators and their differing user-defined associativities and precedences you can never be really sure what the partial AST should even be, since it can change as soon as the next token shows up (e.g., when moving from ""3 + 5"" to ""3 + 5 *"").  This can be sorted out with either (1) explicit parentheses, in which case there is no precedence nonsense (which I would prefer if it were just me using this editor, precedence frankly gets on my nerves), or, (2) inspecting the fixity declarations in scope.  Ideally, for me at least, it would be (1) for editing, but (2) for display.  Also, it depends on how entering code works. I've been thinking of typing arbitrary text in a box and then pressing RET to ""commit it to the AST"", if it's valid the text will become part of the AST, if it's wrong it just stays there in the box. Another, more interesting, way, would be for it to construct the AST as you go. Like this (where | is the caret):  * ⌨`3 +` → `(3 +[|])` * ⌨`3 + 2 * ` → `3 + (2 * [|]])` * ⌨`3 + 2 * 5 )` → `3 + (2 * 5) |` * ⌨`3 + 2 * 5 ) + ` → `3 + (2 * 5) + [|]` * ⌨`3 + 2 * 5 ) + BACKSPACE` → `3 + (2 * 5) |` * ⌨`3 + 2 * 5 ) + BACKSPACE UP LEFT -` → `3 |+ (2 * 5)` * ⌨`3 + 2 * 5 ) + BACKSPACE UP LEFT DEL -` → `3 -| (2 * 5)` * ⌨`3 + 2 * 5 ) + BACKSPACE UP LEFT LEFT 5 -` → `35| + (2 * 5)` * ⌨`"" hello "" ++` → `(""hello"" ++[|])` * ⌨`"" hello "" ++ y` → `(""hello"" ++ y|)` * ⌨`if` → `if|` *(at this point it's still a ""box"")* * ⌨`if SPC` → `if [|] then [] else []` * ⌨`if SPC BACKSPC` → `if|` * ⌨`if SPC x` → `if x| then [] else []` * ⌨`if SPC x TAB y` → `if x| then y| else []` * ⌨`if SPC x TAB y TAB z` → `if x| then y| else z|` * ⌨`case SPC` → `case [|] of [] -&gt; []` * ⌨`case SPC x TAB` → `case x of [|] -&gt; []` * ⌨`case SPC x TAB foo TAB` → `case x of foo -&gt; [|]` * ⌨`case SPC x TAB foo TAB bar` → `case x of foo -&gt; bar|` * ⌨`case SPC x TAB foo TAB bar TAB` → `case x of foo -&gt; bar; [|] -&gt; []`  You get the idea. Similar to paredit. But that's trickier.  &gt; The point is, there's always some stage in programming where everything's a mess.  Can you provide an example where the mess is syntactical mess?  &gt; Trying to impose well-formed structure on the messiness of development in every place and at every time is just doomed to failure,   I disagree, clearly. That's the whole point of a structured editor.  &gt; because development isn't universally pretty and well-structured. People are messy. Creativity is messy. But more importantly, we don't care about how people keep their houses just so long as they present themselves well in public.  You can be messy without being syntactically invalid.  &gt; The obvious solution is to consider an interface like Agda's sheds. In general, Agda will try to compile and typecheck everything for you, but sheds are a way of saying ""hey waitaminute! don't bother checking this part yet, because I know it's a mess"". You do all your mucking around and developing inside of sheds, and when you're ready to show it to the world (i.e., the compiler) then you remove the shed. This way, Agda can check everything that it knows is stable, but avoid things it knows are a mess, and so the checking isn't going to interfere with the messy process of figuring out what the heck you're trying to do.  I think you've misinterpreted my intentions. I don't care about type safety, I care about syntactical correctness. Not because being correct all the time would save me getting compile errors, but because it enables structured editing. Because structured editing, a la paredit, is fast and safe.  Sheds are a nice idea but they're a separate idea. I could also implement sheds separately, in a structured or non-structured editor.",⌨

However, there is conflicting evidence about when this was and what it originally meant.  &gt; According to R. H.

t5_2qyn1,StilRH,1324668470,"You can forbid eggs or turn them off in the kitchen menu - but the minimal amount of fuss and micromanagement (especially if you want SOME of your birds to feed your kitchens) would involved nest boxes and a locked door :) They can take a while to incubate. I once believed that every nest box'd egg would become fertilised if left long enough but now am reviewing that ‼SCIENCE‼ needed. Leaving eggs undisturbed should be enough if a bird with a breeding partner has claimed the nest box. Different species take different gestation periods, you'll know if you're doing it right because you'll get a notification.  The metal situation... As you can change the metal scarcity in the world gen stage and choose which spots to embark on, I wouldn't say it was normal or abnormal - You've not killed yourself, this might be a more challenging embark though as you lack metal for tools and soldiers. Gold is a boon - make nice stuff and trade for the weapon grade metals. See if you have glass and make plenty of glass weapon traps to shred goblins (who should be attracted to your fortress wealth) and then reclaim their weapons - melt the goblinite into dorf worthy gear :) Or you can abandon and start over :)  Assign war dogs to people?

t5_2s4k5,edit1754,1324735949,"Resolution tends to makes more of a difference than any other spec because it affects everything you do. Higher resolutions let you fit more onscreen at once and make a significant difference for productivity and multitasking. Not only that, most 15.6"" 1366x768 screens have significantly worse quality than 15.6"" 1920x1080-resolution screens and (some) 15.6"" 1600x900 resolution screens. 1600x900 in a 17.3"" screen is quite a poor size/resolution combo as well.  Resolution should actually be a category on your spreadsheet. It's way more important than RAM, which is a category. RAM is irrelevant at the time of purchase because you can always upgrade it later and because RAM past 4GB usually doesn't make much of a difference.  Also it's safe to assume that all 15.6"" and 17.3"" Toshiba Satellites have bad screens. I've never seen a Toshiba Satellite with a screen any better than the worst available for its size.  - Same goes for Acer Aspires.  -------  You say the XPS 15 and XPS 15z have bad graphics cards because they have the nVidia 525M? The 525M is actually lot closer to the 540M than to the 520M in performance.

[Configured on Dell's website](http://www.dell.com/us/p/xps-l502x/fs) with the coupon **932N$0ZCCHWZB9**, it's $849 with the base i5 and [1920x1080 display upgrade](http://img189.imageshack.us/img189/5268/xps15display2.png).  ------  * The HP DV6t and HP DV7t currently have misleading information on their configuration pages. It is difficult to figure out what the options for the GPU mean. Once HP clears this up, it should be good to go to order a DV6t or DV7t from their configuration page and the **NBT3886** coupon. Remember: You need the 1920x1080 display and the Radeon 6770M GPU. Those need to be present in the config, everything else is second and should only be considered after these upgrades are in place. Go for a lower base model (ex: regular DV6t instead of the Quad Edition) if necessary, in order to ensure you have **both** of these upgrades in your configuration at a low enough price after the coupon. Note about the coupon: It only works when the final config price is $899+",®

Bush administration. Brownback hired Siedlecki this year to be Kansas’s secretary of social and rehabilitation services.  Siedlecki cut dozens of jobs, closed offices, doubled the size of the team that investigates welfare cheats and rewrote state contracts to encourage providers of state services to promote pro-fatherhood and pro-family ideals. He also hired a Florida pastor, Rick Marks, to head the state’s new healthy-marriage initiative. Marks has been described by some as the state’s “marriage guru.”  After less than a year on the job, Siedlecki resigned this month. But some of his legacy remains.  To help fund its new fatherhood initiative, Kansas has shifted $600,000 from an Early Head Start program in Riley County, which has double the state’s percentage of residents in poverty. Head Start officials said they already have strong fatherhood programming in place and that they would rather have used those funds to get children off the waiting list for day care.  “Dr. Marks — we have a ‘marriage guru’ now — came out to our program, and he was shocked at all the things we do at Head Start,” said Korey Hensley, the director of Heartland Early Education in Salina. “He said, ‘Oh, you do family preservation!’ I said, ‘Absolutely.’ ”  As the opening session of the state legislature approaches in January, officials are preparing for another bruising budget battle. Brownback plans to revamp the state’s tax system with cuts to the income tax rates and plans to change the 20-year-old funding formula for schools, a move that opponents fear could benefit wealthier districts.  “It will be a bloodbath,” said state Sen. Laura Kelly, a Democrat. “There’s going to be a raft of things that will come, but details are lacking. It’s all been so clandestine.”  For his part, Brownback sounded a triumphant note during his recent speech in Wichita.  “We’ve started our reforms,” he said. “It’s going to take some time. We’ve gotten off to a good start.”  Staff researcher Magda Jean-Louis contributed to this report.  © The Washington Post Company",©

We kept moving stuff on into the night, and at about 2 AM I finally see it. It'd been up there for about 14 hours.  My neighbors in that complex never spoke to me...

If the label on the cable on the table at your house,      says the network is connected to the button on your mouse,      but your packets want to tunnel on another protocol,      that's repeatedly rejected by the printer down the hall,      and you screen is all distorted by the side effects of gauss,      so your icons in the window are as wavy as a souse,      then you may as well reboot and go out with a bang,      'cause as sure as I'm a poet, the sucker's gonna hang!          When the copy of your floppy's getting sloppy on the disk,      and the microcode instructions cause unnecessary risk,      then you have to flash your memory, and you'll want to RAM your ROM.

I’m not a producer [yet, but I am definitely working towards that ☺] but I’ve just picked up mixing and have my first gig coming up in two months – and I can tell you, I spent a lot of time becoming a hermit researching, reading forums, learning how to midi map, studying and practicing alone in my room and I now understand why there aren’t many girls in the EDM industry.  We were raised to play with Barbies, baby dolls, and have imaginary tea parties and bake imaginary cupcakes.  And boys, you got remote controlled race cars, Legos, video games, etc - problem solving, building, and learning about technology at an early age.  It’s the same reason why there aren’t many female gamers.  Lucky for me I always liked video games more than Barbies… haha.  But seriously, it’s just unnatural (in general) for females to sit in their rooms alone for hours working on anything that has to do with electronics, not because we’re not smart enough.

t5_2s46m,F00LY,1324974992,"So I complain to my girlfriend alllllll the time how much I hate shaving. It hurts, its boring, it takes forever, it has to be done way too often and its expensive.  What does she do? Hints that I am getting a new razor for Xmas. ..........   I open my gift and to my pleasant surprise it just *looks* fancier than the normal cartridges I have to deal with.  That AND there is a book. Being as I am on break from college, I can actually read said book!  What did I get in total? * 1 Badger Hair Brush * 1 Merkur Futur Razor * 5 Tris Blades * 1 Shaving Soap [Not sure which brand!] * Leisureguy's Guide to Gourmet Shaving * An awesome orange towel * A Styptic Pencil (Burns, but works wonders!)  That said, I shaved today very excitedly for the first time.  I showered first, and then held a towel to my facial hair for a minute or so before hand, alas I should have put the first layer of lather on.  Also while it wasn't particularly thick, I felt like I was having an okay time making the lather. Even enjoying it.  Then it came time to go across the grain.  This was slightly harder, but still worked well. And while the guide said not to, I had to try against the grain.  WTG and XTG just did not remove enough hair for me to be comfortable with the shave.  This is where things got...painful.  I cut myself several times, though I learned a lot in the process. I was holding the blade VERY light and not pushing much at all. I feel like perhaps the blade was bad. As recommended, I plan to try a few more times before switching though.  That said, he recommends early on getting a sampler pack. Is there a specific sampler anyone recommends?  Furthermore, what about a specific preshave soap?  For an aftershave I am currently using Nivea for Men Sensitive Post shave balm.  Thanks to my girlfriend for the gifts ♥ Also, Thanks to any help you all can give! I look forward to making my purchase based off your suggestions! Hopefully my [amazing] girlfriend is right and I can begin to enjoy this. It feels like I will.",♥

t5_2r9vp,silverbullet1,1324998168,"The most popular artificial sweetener in cola beverages is aspartame, which has been cleared again and again by double blind studies.   Did you even read the page you posted? It essentially proves my point.   From your link.   &gt;However, results from subsequent carcinogenicity studies (studies that examine whether a substance can cause cancer) of these sweeteners have not provided clear evidence of an association with cancer in humans.  and   &gt;Aspartame  Aspartame, distributed under several trade names (e.g., NutraSweet® and Equal®), was approved in 1981 by the FDA after numerous tests showed that it did not cause cancer or other adverse effects in laboratory animals. Questions regarding the safety of aspartame were renewed by a 1996 report suggesting that an increase in the number of people with brain tumors between 1975 and 1992 might be associated with the introduction and use of this sweetener in the United States. However, an analysis of then-current NCI statistics showed that the overall incidence of brain and central nervous system cancers began to rise in 1973, 8 years prior to the approval of aspartame, and continued to rise until 1985. Moreover, increases in overall brain cancer incidence occurred primarily in people age 70 and older, a group that was not exposed to the highest doses of aspartame since its introduction. These data do not establish a clear link between the consumption of aspartame and the development of brain tumors.  In 2005, a laboratory study found more lymphomas and leukemias in rats fed very high doses of aspartame (equivalent to drinking 8 to 2,083 cans of diet soda daily) (1). However, there were some inconsistencies in the findings. For example, the number of cancer cases did not rise with increasing amounts of aspartame as would be expected. An FDA statement on this study can be found at http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/2006/ucm108650.htm on the Internet.  Subsequently, NCI examined human data from the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study of over half a million retirees. Increasing consumption of aspartame-containing beverages was not associated with the development of lymphoma, leukemia, or brain cancer (2).  All from your link.   &gt;Coke contains caffeine, so it does have an physical and psychological addictive property.  It's addictive qualities are hardly extreme in a physical sense, and anything can be psychologically addictive. ",®

You may be assured the safety and well-being of all of our guests is the utmost importance to us.  Crime never has, or ever will be, a welcome guest at our theme parks.  We are sorry when anyone endures the pain of a crime, that's why we work so hard to prevent it.  In a recent review of publicly-available FBI statistics, the Walt Disney World Resort had the lowest rate of crime than in any Metropolitan Statistical Area, or in any city or county with a comparable population, in the United States of America (Note: The resort has an average daily population in excess of 200,000 people).  We conduct criminal background checks on new employees and regularly screen all 55,000 of our employees against Florida law enforcement's database of sexual predators and sex offenders.  Our well-trained Security Department has 1,250 employees who provide a highly visible deterrent to crime, 24-hours-a-day.  In addition, by special contract, local law enforcement's routine on-site presence is enhanced by local deputies.  We provide them office space, company radios to monitor all activity and open access to our property.  spirit_spine we hope you will find this information helpful.  We look forward to future opportunities to entertain you in our resort.  If you have questions or need further assistance, feel free to contact us.  Please include your full name, E-Mail address, and reservation number if applicable on all correspondence.  Sincerely,  Claire Flores WDW Online Communications",®

New people entering this pool can be immigrants, canadian migrants, people coming of age, people separating and any other form of splitting or additions.  I can make the assumption that on any given day there are more ""rent/buy eligible"" people entering the city than any amount of homes being bough or sold.  As for my theory on housing prices I believe it is a supply and demand issue.   There is limited supply and demand is high.    As with anything in this case prices will rise.   Couple that with historically low interest rates and you have the perfect storm.   How can we fix it?  Increase supply, Vancouver is adding coach homes and other measures.  And decrease demand by raising interest rates.   Some facts:   http://www.akcanada.com/lic_vancouver.cfm ""During the period of 2001 to 2006 Vancouver became home to 151,695 new Canadian immigrants.

t5_2qh6c,theram4,1325116785,"I recently read the book [The Bondage Breaker](http://www.amazon.com/Bondage-Breaker®-Neil-T-Anderson/dp/0736902414) by Neil T Anderson. In it, the author makes the point that we ought to get rid of anything that resembles demonic power, because if we allow even the slightest foothold, Satan will take that foothold and try to increase his power over our lives.  Here's the thing. Some people are very spiritually weak. For these weak, I would not recommend things like yoga or any other activity that has it's roots in mysticism. For the strong, they realize that there is nothing inherently wrong about yoga, acupuncture, or any of the things you mentioned. We are strong enough to base on faith on the true healing power of Jesus Christ.   But again, there are many who might get into these things and delve ever more into mysticism or satanism. It's all how we look at things. The Bible makes it clear that we shouldn't just make rules for the sake of making rules, and especially not to prevent others from exercising their freedoms they have in Christ. But we also shouldn't put a stumbling block in anyone's way, especially not in our own way.",®

So according to my experiences, yes.  Atheists, on the other hand, will mostly agree that both people to believe there is no god and people who lack a belief in god are both atheists.  You'll rarely see an atheist using a True Scotsman fallacy regarding another atheist, unless the rest of the population agrees.  Christians, on the other hand, all think they *are* ""True© Christians"", yet can barely agree amongst themselves on what that actually *is*.  All they know is that if an atheist gives their two cents on what it means, it will be wrong... because they are atheist.  &gt;.&gt;  Case in point, I call anyone who believes Jesus is the Son of God and Christ a Christian.

t5_2qh2a,Prettym1k3,1325201015,"I took a class at WPPI last year that absolutely changed my workflow in Lightroom.  My very first order of business is to sync cameras.  Having a second body, or a back-up shooter's camera even 5-10 seconds off of my own is super frustrating, and while you can change that in Lightroom, it may never be 100% perfect.  So start there.  As for my filing system, I'm a PC guy, and use folders.  They're all in a main ""Prettym1k3's Photography"" folder.  From there, I sub-folder into Automotive, Children, Families, Architecture, Weddings, etc.  Then I sub-folder again into the name of the car's owner, the couple's name, the family name, etc.  Then inside of each of those folders I keep folders for Blog, Jpeg, RAW Images, etc.  I do weddings, so after importing 1:1 rendered images and sorting them by date and time taken, I go through and I pick (using the ""P"" key) and flag my good images.  Then I go through again, and unpick (using the ""U"" key) the ones I realized were duplicates or ones that weren't up to par.  Then I go through and have my wife 1 star (using the ""1"" key) any images she doesn't like.  Then I review.  I 5 star (using the ""5"" key) anything I plan to blog or leak onto my Facebook page early.  Then I edit in LR, and move to CS5 when necessary.  When uploading into Lightroom, I always pull files straight from the folder that they're in on my computer.  So when I offload memory cards, I move the physical files into their proper folders on my C:/ drive.  I never import and make a duplicate copy through Lightroom.  I've had problems doing that in the past.  As for everything else, I use descriptions.  Each photoshoot I do, and each family gathering I get ""volunteered"" to shoot for my personal family, I use names of people, dates, locations (city, state, landmarks) and the even name (wedding, family shoot, birthday, anniversary, etc.).  Remember to insert your Copyright metadata into Lightroom and use it for ALL of your images.  Every single one.  Yay for Facebook, if you have it.  Facebook will read certain portions of your metadata or programmed copyright information (if you can do that with your camera - my D7000 and D700 will do that) and read it.  So under each image I host on Facebook it says ""© Prettym1k3 Photography 2011"".  Sorry if that didn't fully answer your question, but hope that helps.  I think I jumped around a little bit.  In the end, sitting down with someone who has a complete and smooth system, learning what they do, and making adjustments to better fit your style/goals is key.  I've had a few people come over for a little sit down sesh and, as I'm told, they feel 100% better when they leave.  For perspective, the last wedding I shot I ended up with 4,500 images.  Culled down to 1,100 in 3 hours.  Culled down to 900 in another hour.  Fully edited in an additional 4 hours, including blemish removal, B&amp;W conversions, etc.  (Not bragging, just intending to show that the system I use works for me quite well).",©

t5_2qh13,darkwasthenight,1325209569,"Well, it's a pretty big problem when it comes to acoustic guitars. The nut and saddle are often made from ivory. It's usually marketed as ""pre-ban"" material, but I think it's pretty shameful to have a ""pre-ban"" stockpile of these guitar parts or (more likely) to just get it fresh and lie about it.  Anyway, it does lend a different sound to a guitar. For those looking for an ivory sound without the guilt, Tusq® is a synthetic material that is very common which many guitar makers like Taylor have opted for due to its sound being a bit more open in the lower end than ivory.  Still, real ivory does sound *different*, and it's a sound that some people want. Those people should just buy old guitars that already have ivory in 'em, though.",®
t5_2qhnf,bobbaphet,1325209980,"&gt;Are you saying that there are buddhist concepts which are not readily provable, but which are ~~expected~~ beneficial to be believed by some buddhists?  &gt;Or are you saying that sometimes, in buddhism, you have to have confidence or reasonable expectation of an outcome based on observable evidence?  I'm saying yes to both because that is what the Buddha taught. With one slight alteration of the first statement, that I indicated in the quote.   Thanissaro Bhikkhu, one of the prominent pali translators, explains it in great depth for anyone who is interested.   [Faith In Awakening by Thanissaro Bhikkhu © 2006–2011](http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/faithinawakening.html)  The Buddha never placed unconditional demands on anyone's faith. And for anyone from a culture where the dominant religions do place such demands on one's faith, this is one of Buddhism's most attractive features. We read his famous instructions to the Kalamas, in which he advises testing things for oneself, and we see it as an invitation to believe, or not, whatever we like. Some people go so far as to say that faith has no place in the Buddhist tradition, that the proper Buddhist attitude is one of skepticism.  But even though the Buddha recommends tolerance and a healthy skepticism toward matters of faith, he also makes a conditional request about faith: If you sincerely want to put an end to suffering — that's the condition — you should take certain things on faith, as working hypotheses, and then test them through following his path of practice. +++++++++++  He then goes on to explain how a western view inherently misinterprets Buddhist faith.

When we are concentrating on something, like a computer screen, we tend not to blink as often and this can dry out our eyes. Purposeful blinking or closing the eyes for short periods of time when reading, watching T.V. or working on a computer may help alleviate dry eye symptoms.      Eligibility  The Dry Eye Disease Study is a Canada-wide randomized trial investigating the effectiveness of a new eye drop formulation against commonly used eye drops named Refresh® Tears.  Men and women over the age of 18 who experience symptoms of dry, burning, itching eyes may qualify to participate.   Other symptoms of dry eye disease include red eye, a pulling sensation on the eye, the feeling that something is in the eye, blurred vision, tiredness and increased sensitivity to light.   Dry eye disease is caused when there is an imbalance between tear production and tear evaporation.  Factors that can alter this balance include aging, contact lens use, eye strain and exposure to dry and extreme weather conditions.   For more information about the study or to see if you qualify to participate:  Visit http://dryeyestudy.ca/   Call 1-855-85-TRIAL (87425).  ",®

As a side note, I will tell you that you are definitely a great looking guy. I know that all the compliments in the world can't help you with a low self-image, but over time you will realize how attractive you are, and life will be excellent for you. ♥  I can tell you that I personally have struggled with weight for 12 years now. I got a pituitary tumor when I was a senior in HS, and due to the hormonal and emotional issues I went through, I gained a -lot- of weight.   I have tried so many different ways to lose weight, and have been unable to drop any. I have actually gained, and currently at 29 I stand 5'9"" and weigh 320 lbs. I am a female, and have always had body/self image issues, even when I was thin (but didn't realize it).  My mom suggests I get a gastric bypass so that I can lose weight, and then continue my current methods to keep it off. I walk at least a mile every day, and workout in the gym. I eat very little, and sometimes not at all. The depression gets so bad sometimes that I will sink under the weight of it (no pun intended  &gt;_&lt;) and just binge on all the sweet crap foods I can fit in my face.   I hope one day I can post some amazing before/after photos here like you did to join the ranks of healthy people proud of their accomplishments.  :)",♥

I switched to another site that allowed embeds, but they merged with another site that does not.  So in mid-June, I started making them myself.  They’re not really cartoons, per se.  They are graphics, but I call them cartoons because they serve that function here.  Except for sick days, I’ve posted one daily ever since, and let me tell you this.

t5_2snuc,ShamanSTK,1325324044,"&gt; The existence of God is unfalsifiable, which sounds good for God, but in the context of logic and science is A Bad Thing©. This is the same thing as using an all-powerful god as a premise; you always win, but the argument holds no weight. If there is no method of proving something wrong, how can you tell it's right? Faith.  Right, but unfalsifiable isn't necessarily a limitation. It just means you need to find the most internally consistent philosophy that, not only explains this world, but predicts it. This is specifically the part I take issue with.  &gt;  in the context of **logic** and science is A Bad Thing©.  Logic is not limited to falsifiable endeavors. In fact, that was the main contention between empiricism and logicism. If you're making scientific and falsifiable claims, you're doing religion wrong. But, there's nothing wrong with extending logics further than what is empirically verifiable, like spirituality, ethics, morality, and general philosophy. My problem with a religion being built on unconsidered premises is solely that they are unconsidered for their truth. Among Judaism's first formal answers to these types of demands, namely substantiating your premises, is Saadia Gaon's The Book of Beliefs and Opinions and Maimonides' Guide for the Perplexed. While they cite to scripture to show that the premises have always been substantiated, they build from scratch logical proofs for Judaism's premises. This is what started the Jewish Rationalism movement which would use contemporary science and logics to demonstrate basic theological truths. Judaism considers blind faith to be a poor basis of a religion, but rather, it is preferable to believe what you believe because you've seen it to be true.",©

Tell her the Bible commands us to drink.  And Jesus FIRST MIRACLE From John chapter 2:  7 Jesus said to the servants, “Fill the jars with water”; so they filled them to the brim.  8 Then he told them, “Now draw some out and take it to the master of the banquet.”  They did so, 9 and the master of the banquet tasted the water that had been turned into wine. He did not realize where it had come from, though the servants who had drawn the water knew. Then he called the bridegroom aside 10 and said, “Everyone brings out the choice wine first and then the cheaper wine after the guests have had too much to drink; but you have saved the best till now.”  11 This, the first of his miraculous signs, Jesus performed at Cana in Galilee. He thus revealed his glory, and his disciples put their faith in him.   There is NOTHING scriptural about NOT drinking. Jesus made it, and encouraged it. Paul TOLD people to drink.   Tell your Mom that her issue with alcohol is cultural, and has nothing to do with the Bible and/or Christianity.  Maybe ask her why she is so against Jesus' and Paul's teachings.",©

Did you read the system requirements?  550 Watt or greater power supply with one 150W **8-pin PCI Express**® power connector and one 75W 6-pin PCI Express® power connector recommended  Here is the AMD 6900 series approved PSU list:  http://support.amd.com/us/certified/power-supplies/Pages/listing.aspx   I took a look at your board and it does have integrated graphics.  Please refer to your user manual.   If you do not have your manual, you may download a copy from here:  ftp://174.142.97.10/manual/K10N78FullHD-hSLI%20R3.0.pdf  Please refer to page 45 which details how to gain access to the BIOS.  Then refer to page 53 which details Chipset options and how to change/set your Primary Graphics Adapter.   You would select PCI Express. Save and exit the BIOS.  If you were using the onboard graphics and did not previously correct this setting, you may now get some signs of life.  However if you try to fire up a game in 3D mode where the video chip now needs to draw it's full rated power requirement, the computer will probably shut down.  You may very well (almost certainly, in fact) blow out the PSU which in turn could blow out and damage other system components.  Govern yourself accordingly. Swap the PSU and that does't fix it, it's time to go under the hood into the BIOS as I mentioned and change over to PCI Express.  That should do it. Hope this helps.",®
