t5_2qh7d,neuromonkey,1296522293,"&gt; I pulled your type from 2 posts!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  You *guessed* my type (incorrectly, it turned out. I am primarily introverted.) based on a tiny data set. That's hardly scientific.  Many people have accurately guessed my astrological sign based on my personality, that doesn't necessarily mean anything. The fact that you semi-correctly identified my M-B type based on a tiny amount of social behavior, and feel that this comprises some form of *proof* says little about the validity of M-B typing, and more about your own intellectual methods.  &gt; Yes, really INTJ's are the smartest.  As I said earlier, in order to even argue that point, you would need to explicitly define what you mean by ""smart.""  Could you cite a study that supports this assertion, or is this your opinion? I'm not talking about a sociological opinion piece, I'm talking about a scientifically valid study. Frankly, it's hard for me to believe that someone who actually believes that is... no offence intended... all that smart. In high school, when I was having academic problems, one of the tests I was subjected to was an IQ test. I got a 162. I have never put much stock in that. I've known people with tested lower IQs who were much more capable than I, in certain areas. When I worked at MIT, I knew people who were much, much smarter than I, but who weren't as capable at some things as I was. Intelligence isn't a linear value, nor can it be directly correlated to any analysis of ""personality type.""  Let's assume that INTJ's are, as a group, ""the smartest."" Within that group, you are going to have a distribution of intelligences. If that distribution matched that of the general population, (ie. a bell-curve, centered at around 100,) you could be INTJ and be very bright or very dim. If [this](http://www.myersbriggs.org/my-mbti-personality-type/my-mbti-results/how-frequent-is-my-type.asp) data were accurate, then INTJ's make up about 2.1% of the population. If your assertion is that the INTJ group is comprised entirely of people at the top of the intelligence distribution curve, then we have an quite an astonishing coincidence on our hands.  You are asserting that all or most highly intelligent people are of a particular ""personality type,"" all having similar thinking styles, reactions, desires, perceptions, lifestyles, and behaviors. This is demonstrably incorrect. If you examine the set of people having the highest intelligences, you find every type of person in the mix, from Einstein to the unibomber; actors to gas station attendants; programmers to carpenters; chemists to farmers; musicians to bakers; engineers to zookeepers. There are highly intelligent and deeply stupid people everywhere.  Viewed another way: What you are suggesting is amazingly improbable given that there are *virtually zero similarities* between traditional IQ testing and Myers-Briggs assessment. IQ tests measure problem solving, pattern matching, associative agility, math and spatial skills, whereas M-B testing was originally designed to determine a person's preferences and inclinations for the purpose of placing them in a job where they would function well. For two such completely different sets of tests, the idea that they might produce such perfectly identical or overlapping results is unlikely to the point of impossibility.  I've seen people change. I've seen people change their daily habits, their preferences, their desires, their emotional conditions, their behavior, and certainly their opinions. I've watched people change their thinking based on learning new languages. Furthermore, I have changed myself. Not completely, not fundamentally as a person, but I have changed quite a lot over the past 15 years; certainly more than enough to alter my alleged M-B type.  Furthermore, if by ""smart,"" you *are* referring to intelligence quotient, that is something that changes over time, as IQ is scored as a function of **age**. If your IQ changes over your lifespan, and your M-B type (as you suggest) does not, they are not directly correlated. Frankly, I can't think of a single reason why they'd be even loosely correlated.  &gt; People never change they only act differently.  How does one determine a person's makeup, other than by their actions? Isn't a large component of the MBTI® assessment an analysis of human behaviors?  &gt; As an INTJ and a mensa member I find a lot of book and teachers for that matter or wrong in not logical.  Um. Yeah. I can only guess at what you're trying to say here, though I will say that it isn't suggestive of ""smarts"" or critical thinking.  &gt; I can tell someones type just by looking at them. How the hair is.  &gt; The way they stand what and how they are wearing clothes.  Yow. You just demonstrated that you are talking about superstition, not science. Are you, by any chance about 14-15 years old? If so, I could find your thinking forgivable, and would encourage you to stay in school.  You are either an awesome, awesome troll, or someone who isn't quite the critical thinker you believe yourself to be. Having achieved a MENSA membership, why don't you go out for The Prometheus Society, Four Sigma... or, what the hell! Go for The Pi or Mega Societies!  I'm trying not to be insulting, but instead of trying to convince me of these things, I suggest that you make an effort to learn to think critically about them for yourself.  &gt; If you ""change"" an opinion you never had it in the first place.  This is such a bizarre statement, that I cannot possibly refute it logically. It has no logical basis to address. If a person is capable of learning, they are capable of changing every aspect of their world view. Many linguists assert that our language structures how we think. Learning new languages, particularly very different languages, can change thought patterns enormously.  [This](http://www.overcomingbias.com/) is also a good site.  The MBTI® assessment is simplistic and incomplete at best, and a deeply flawed pseudoscience at worst. If you believe in it, that's certainly your prerogative. While so-called ""Ladder Theory"" has some basis in reality, (in the same way stereotypes do,) it is yet another example of a simplistic way to evaluate potentially complex human relationships. As a simple model, it's clever and fine. As a way to actually analyze real people in real relationships, it is utter bullshit.

t5_mouw,Velorum,1296558614,"Massive pressure on the thl.fi servers. Just in case its slow/down here is a plain text of the news release: __   Increased risk of narcolepsy observed among children and adolescents vaccinated with PandemrixR  1 Feb 2011  Among those 4-19 years of age who received Pandemrix®-vaccine had a manifold increased risk of falling ill with narcolepsy during the 8 months following vaccination in comparison to those unvaccinated in the same age group. Based on the evaluation done so far, the National Narcolepsy Task Force finds it probable that Pandemrix®-vaccination contributed to the observed increase in incidence of narcolepsy among those 4 -19 years of age. Currently, the most likely explanation is that the increase in narcolepsy is by joint effect of the vaccine and some other factor(s). At the moment, there is no evidence that the increase in narcolepsy observed in Finland could be attributed to the vaccine lots used. The results can be read in the Interim Report of the Task Force which is published on February 1st, 2011.  The association of Pandemrix-vaccination and narcolepsy was studied using extensive registry based data. Data gathered from hospital discharge registries on patients fallen ill with narcolepsy during years 2009-10 was linked with data from primary care records on pandemic vaccination. The observed association is so evident that it is unlikely that other so-called confounding factors could fully explain the phenomenon.  In Finland during years 2009–10, 60 children and adolescents aged 4-19 years fell ill with narcolepsy. These figures base on data from hospitals and primary care, and the review of individual patient records by a panel of neurologists and sleep researchers. Of those fallen ill, 52 (almost 90 percent) had received Pandemrix® vaccine, while the vaccine coverage in the entire age group was 70 percent. Based on the preliminary analyses, the risk of falling ill with narcolepsy among those vaccinated in the 4-19 years age group was 9-fold in comparison to those unvaccinated in the same age group. This increase was most pronounced among those 5–15 years of age. No cases were observed among those under 4 years of age. Also, no increase in cases of narcolepsy or signs of vaccination impacting risk of falling ill with narcolepsy was observed among those above 19 years of age.  In addition to Finland, increase in cases of narcolepsy observed only in Sweden and Iceland   In 2009, among countries using similar pandemic vaccine as was used in Finland, an increase in cases of narcolepsy has been observed only in Finland, Sweden and Iceland. Contrary to the observations in Finland, narcolepsy has occurred in greater numbers than expected also among unvaccinated children and teenagers in Iceland.  The association between narcolepsy and PandemrixR vaccine requires more investigations  During the coming months, these preliminary register based results will be confirmed in Finland.  In further investigations, special attention will be given to infections and other stimuli in close time association with the pandemic vaccination. The significance of the possible joint effects will be explored.  In addition, other significant co-factors contributing to the onset of narcolepsy will be evaluated in epidemiologic, immunologic and genetic studies planned. The main aim of the immunologic studies is to clarify, whether the immunological responses to the different components of the Pandemrix® vaccine and to the A(H1N1) virus among those children and teenagers with genetic disposition to narcolepsy and those fallen ill with narcolepsy differ from the immunological responses of other children and teenagers not belonging to these risk groups.  It is also of utmost importance to find out whether the association is observed also elsewhere than in Finland. At present, Finland is participating in the ECDC contracted, VAESO led narcolepsy background incidence and case control studies which are being conducted in 9 European Union countries by pharmacovigilance researchers from Public Health Institutes, Regulatory Agencies and Universities. These studies will evaluate the contribution of the pandemic vaccines and other risk factors in the onset of narcolepsy, and confirm whether increase in incidence in narcolepsy is seen in other countries. The outcomes of these studies will be reported during early summer 2011.  By January 24, 2011, 56 notifications of narcolepsy in association with Pandemrix® vaccination have been received by the National Vaccine Adverse Events Register maintained at the National Institute of Health and Welfare in Finland. Of these, 54 cases belonged to the age group of 4–19 years. Among most of the notified cases, the onset of symptoms of narcolepsy had started approximately two months following Pandemrix® vaccination.  The final report from the National Narcolepsy Task Force will be released by 31st August 2011.

GreenCell Technologies Inc. is pleased to announce the successful development and forthcoming release of a new product to complement its HydroCell™ unit. (Toronto) – GreenCell Technologies GT5 Develops New Wireless Product to Complement HydroCell™ unit. GreenCell Technologies Inc. is pleased to announce the successful development and forthcoming release of a new product to complement its HydroCell™ unit. Based on recent feedback from long-haul truckers, the GreenCell research team has now designed a wireless status indicator that will be manufactured and sold as a package in tandem with its popular Hydrogen Enrichment System. The innovative device simply plugs into the cigarette lighter on the dashboard and instantly indicates the current status of the HydroCell™ and its present operating condition. The driver will instantly be aware if the HydroCell™ is in need of water and can rectify the condition which will minimize downtime. The HydroCell™ requires the addition of water every 40 - 50 hours of operation and will shut down and not generate Hydrogen if allowed to run dry. This device will ensure maximum fuel savings by eliminating downtime due to lack of water. HydroCell™ has exceeded expectations and is typically doubling hydrogen output and increasing fuel efficiencies for transportation companies and independent drivers alike. Hydrogen, as a fuel, is emission free and the only by-product of combustion is water. It is the most abundant element in the universe and is the fuel of choice for the Space Shuttle’s main engine. To assure continued fuel savings, the HydroCell™ is always tested for performance, efficiency, reliability and hydrogen output on numerous vehicles, to enhance its core design and help refine the product specifications for engineers. In addition to recent discoveries, GreenCell Technologies GT5 is also conducting extensive lab tests to establish the most efficient electrolyte mixture and the optimal Anode to Cathode distance for maximum hydrogen production. These tests will lead to new modifications to increase hydrogen output, boost fuel efficiency overall and reduce manufacturing costs. The HydroCell™ is an electrolysis-based on-demand Hydrogen generator designed specifically for the transport industry. The product draws a small amount of power from the vehicles electrical system and uses it to produce Hydrogen gas from a water-based solution. The HydroCell™ directs the produced Hydrogen gas to the intake of the vehicles engine where it acts as a catalyst during the normal combustion cycle. This creates more power and fewer emissions, burning only the existing fuel in the cylinder, resulting simply in less fuel being required to operate the vehicle. GT5 GreenCell Technologies Inc. is a Canadian company, dedicated to designing and bringing to market technology-based products for the transportation and energy industries.

t5_2qi86,iForgetWhereWeParked,1296743535,"It sounds like your local RACES guys were less interested in actually being an Emergency Service than they were looking to be part of a club.  There was an incredibly scathing commentary in the Correspondence section of QST in September 2010 about this sort of thing:  &gt;**TRAIN TO BE READY** &gt; &gt;The article by Assistant Editor Steve Sant Andrea, AG1YK, article touches only on the tip of the iceberg [""When Not to Operate,"" Apr 2010, page 74]. A not often enough thought of summary says ""Amateurs train until they think can do it right, professionals train until they cannot do it wrong."" Many in our community find that offensive because our name is ""amateur,"" yet others say ""amateur in name only."" That's a big difference. Which is correct? Answer: It depends. &gt; &gt;It depends on if you are in Amateur Radio as a hobby or if you think of yourself as a communicator. A communicator can have fun in the hobby, but few hobby people are even remotely adequate communicators. While both use radios, there is little else in common. From what I have seen, the majority of ARES®/RACES/MARS groups are woefully short in training. They feel that being able to check into a net and possibly operate a Packet station means they are trained. AG1 YK's example of a 25 word message requiring 15 minutes to pass is accurate, and that is horrifying! &gt; &gt;Does this mean that to be a communicator that you must spend hours every day or days every week at training? No, it does not. It does mean that you as an individual must decide for yourself if you wish to become a communicator, and if you say yes, plan what you can do and how much time you have available to accomplish it. Checking in to a net with your name and call does not prepare you for an emergency net. Similarly, being able to take check-ins for a weekly net does not prepare you to be a real NCS. Many will complain that they don't have the time. Fine, you have just defined when you will be ready as a communicator. &gt; &gt;You must participate regularly - at least for the first few years - in public service nets, training nets, data nets and anything else you can. It is only by learning to apply the training materials that are available (some available at no cost) that you begin to become a communicator. Just please do not say ""I'll be ready when I'm needed"" unless you have trained, really trained. &gt; &gt;PAT LAMBERT, W0IPL, ARRL Life Member &gt; &gt;Longmont, Colorado ",®

GreenCell Technologies Inc. is pleased to announce the successful development and forthcoming release of a new product to complement its HydroCell™ unit.  Based on recent feedback from long-haul truckers, the GreenCell research team has now designed a wireless status indicator that will be manufactured and sold as a package in tandem with its popular Hydrogen Enrichment System.  The innovative device simply plugs into the cigarette lighter on the dashboard and instantly indicates the current status of the HydroCell™ and its present operating condition. The driver will instantly be aware if the HydroCell™ is in need of water and can rectify the condition which will minimize downtime.    The HydroCell™ requires the addition of water every 40 - 50 hours of operation and will shut down and not generate Hydrogen if allowed to run dry. This device will ensure maximum fuel savings by eliminating downtime due to lack of water.  HydroCell™ has exceeded expectations and is typically doubling hydrogen output and increasing fuel efficiencies for transportation companies and independent drivers alike.  Hydrogen, as a fuel, is emission free and the only by-product of combustion is water.  It is the most abundant element in the universe and is the fuel of choice for the Space Shuttle’s main engine.    To assure continued fuel savings, the HydroCell™ is always tested for performance, efficiency, reliability and hydrogen output on numerous vehicles, to enhance its core design and help refine the product specifications for engineers.  In addition to recent discoveries, GreenCell Technologies GT5 is also conducting extensive lab tests to establish the most efficient electrolyte mixture and the optimal Anode to Cathode distance for maximum hydrogen production.  These tests will lead to new modifications to increase hydrogen output, boost fuel efficiency overall and reduce manufacturing costs.    The HydroCell™ is an electrolysis-based on-demand Hydrogen generator designed specifically for the transport industry. The product draws a small amount of power from the vehicles electrical system and uses it to produce Hydrogen gas from a water-based solution. The HydroCell™ directs the produced Hydrogen gas to the intake of the vehicles engine where it acts as a catalyst during the normal combustion cycle. This creates more power and fewer emissions, burning only the existing fuel in the cylinder, resulting simply in less fuel being required to operate the vehicle.  GT5 GreenCell Technologies Inc. is a Canadian company, dedicated to designing and bringing to market technology-based products for the transportation and energy industries.

t5_2fwo,noiserr,1296850164,I was actually curious as to what the impact of GIL was on this benchmark so I ran some benchmarks myself. Page 33 of the linked [.pdf](http://www.dabeaz.com/python/UnderstandingGIL.pdf) goes into details of why GIL impacts performance on multi core systems. I hope you find these results as interesting as I did.  I've tested this on a 3.2Ghz Quad core Phenom II computer. Running Ubuntu. During benches I did have a browser running but I wasn't doing anything too CPU impacting like Video or heavy JS pages.. But take these results with a grain of salt.  First I ran tests on the host 4 core system all tests are with 50 million token modifications. Interpreters used:  Python 2.6.5 and 32-bit PyPy 1.4.1      4core_host$ time python threadring.py 50000000     292     real    11m4.366s     user    3m38.980s     sys    6m57.490s      4core_host$ time bin/pypy threadring.py 50000000     292     real    10m22.042s     user    2m53.070s     sys    6m55.460s  Next I tried setting CPU affinity to only one core:      4core_host$ time taskset 2073 python threadring.py 50000000     292     real    7m17.701s     user    2m20.990s     sys    4m11.730s      4core_host$ time taskset 2073 bin/pypy threadring.py 50000000     292     real    6m46.881s     user    1m53.460s     sys    4m6.970s  So we almost doubled the performance by telling the kernel to only use one core. Some of the performance gain may be due to hardware context switching and NUMA.  Now let's look at the single core VM I have running on the same machine:      1core_vm$ time python threadring.py 50000000     292     real    2m3.801s     user    0m38.718s     sys    1m23.933s      1core_vm$ time bin/pypy threadring.py 50000000     292     real    1m52.973s     user    0m28.730s     sys    1m22.881s  GIL seems to be impacting this benchmark by quite a bit. By simply moving the benchmark from a quad core system to a single core system we managed to increase the performance by almost 6 times (not even taking VM overhead into consideration).  The original [benchmarks](http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/u64q/program.php?test=threadring&amp;lang=python3&amp;id=2) were executed on a x64 Ubuntu : Intel® Q6600® quad-core system.  edit: oh actually on that same website I found an alternative python thread_ring benchmark using coroutines instead of _thread:  http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/u64q/program.php?test=threadring&amp;lang=python3&amp;id=3  Which showed a dramatic increase in execution time of this benchmark. ,®

From my perspective you might as well suggest using WebTV for all the overlap between what I use my computer for and what Windows is useful for.  Of course, people use computers for different things so YMMV.  In my case, my computers are employed for Science™ and engineering, software Q/A, etc. purposes plus a little web browsing.   I don't have any games installed right now, but when I play a game it would be some kind of tetris/puzzle game and there are many fun ones for GNU/Linux.  Typically I'll have dozens of terminal sessions going— many connected to remote systems—, a web browser, a couple of R or gnuplot windows, and a emacs session running.  When I work with windows running colleges on joint projects I get the distinct impression that they are computing handicapped.  Questions that I can answer with a one line bit of cli+awk or something are too often too much work for them to bother exploring while it's just no big deal for me. 40GB data set? feh, no big deal, I'm sshed into a 32 way machine with 64 gigs of ram, and the tools I just used will work just as well over there....  I'm often left with the impression that Windows is just a computing etch-a-sketch— it might be turning complete, just as an etch-a-sketch can create amazing art— not something you'd want to use for real work.  Though perhaps I'm just that much more 'ninja' than others. ;)  Of course the learning curve is steep. Some things that are easy in windows are much harder, and new users don't even know about all the new things that they can do which are now easier / reasonably-possible, so the rewards are probably low at first except for the pleasure of learning something new.  I wouldn't recommend dual booting. Not only will the lack of forced immersion slow your learning but you'll often find yourself in 'the wrong system for the job'.   You'd be better off using two computers or a VM (though the slower learning is probably double true for the VM).   Beyond the direct advantages in the system there is also an inherit advantage of diversity.  You can be a greater contributor to a team if the skills and tools you have do not completely overlap with everyone elses.

t5_2fwo,aim2free,1297036855,"There are many ways we can fight. One is to encourage free software whenever we can. Proprietary software constitutes an artificial scarcity. Encourage the usage of licenses like GPL/DSL and Creative Commons.  The reason why software is important, is that tomorrow's replicators will be controlled by software, then it's important that we are in control of that software, as we need to be in control of the internet and similar communication channels.  We already have 3D-printers able to print in stainless steel, OK, they may not be cheap, but within not too far in the future they will fall in price, other printers and systems will become available that will allow us to produce stuff like chips, clothes, cars etc on our own, and when these also become able to self-replicate, then we start having the basis for a revolution to kill most of the greed.  However, I guess there will be a lot of forces trying to keep us in control, to limit our possibilities (sw patents, insane copyrights laws, ACTA etc) these we need to fight, and I suggest building a network where we become independent of these laws. The Swedish ISP Bahnhof did recently a smart thing to counteract the new Storage Directive, where ISP would be required to store a lot of information about people's communication. Their answer, give each customer a strongly crypted VPN line, implying no useful information to store :)  Over time, the nano technology will certainly come, when we can build anything, atom for atom. Then I see it as highly essential that we have got rid of greed, as well as the desire for control over money. The simplest way to do that, is to create the moneyless society. I'm not speaking about replacing money with bits, that has mostly happened long time ago, but really the moneyless society. Money is needed only due to scarcity. When the scarcity becomes only purely artificial, then there is no need for money any more. Of course, there are finite resources like land and water which are not trivial to deal with, but I am optimistic. If we can combat greed and power-hungriness I'm quite convinced that we can learn to share our finite resources, in some way.  Regarding my own plan, I'm working on a concept now, it's getting slowly forward as my resources are not big, but the concept is to create products from people's desires and wishes, we call this concept [Wish-IT®](http://wish-it.com) (Wish Innovation Technologies). This is a system to generate new free (GPL/DSL) products from people's desires and expectations. When technology improves this will allow more and more people to get products which are more and more adapted towards their personal needs, to constantly lower and lower costs and efforts. Finally, when we get nano technology, all limits for creativity will be taken away.  Other ways I see is to work with Pirate parties all over the world. Pirate parties as such are not about left or right, socialism versus capitalism. Pirate parties are pro free market, but also against all forms of artificial restrictions and they are strong proponents for free software. However, the free market, is the foundation to create a society in progress, towards this utopia, if artificial restrictions and monopolies like patents and insane copyrights are taken away, and common things like infra structure is not allowed to be controlled by private interests, then we have the foundation for the future.",®

Note that are right in line with the CONTEXT OF THE OP (hopefully you have that figured out by now):  &gt;Theism, in the broadest sense, is the belief that at least one deity exists.[1][2] **In a more specific sense, theism refers to a doctrine concerning the nature of a monotheistic God and God's relationship to the universe.[3]** Theism, in this specific sense, conceives of God as personal, present and active in the governance and organization of the world and the universe. **The use of the word theism as indicating a particular doctrine of monotheism arose in the wake of the scientific revolution** of the seventeenth century **to contrast with the then emerging deism** that contended that God, though transcendent and supreme, did not intervene in the natural world and could be known rationally but not via revelation.[4]  and  &gt;Deism (pronounced /ˈdiːɪzəm/ ( listen), US dict: dē′·ĭzm)[1][2] in the philosophy of religion is the standpoint that reason and observation of the natural world, without the need for organized religion, can determine that a supreme being created the universe.

t5_2qh1i,Release_the_KRAKEN,1297065923,"Err..ok so..its a nice computer but there is one pretty fucking epic problem here. I got the feeling from your earlier responses that you want to game on it. Problem here, is that the Lenovo has:  &gt;Up to NVIDIA® GeForce® 305M 512MB graphics.  And this, is..a phenomenally shit graphics card. Like..I thought I had it bad with my 310M but..your lenovo's card is above and beyond shit. For clarification: The 3 simply refers to the 3rd generation of the card. 05 means its right at entry level.  I can't seem to find a review for the 305M, but if you take a look at the [review for the 310M](http://www.notebookcheck.net/NVIDIA-GeForce-310M.22439.0.html), you can see that its a pretty damn punny graphics card. The 305 is only lesser in performance.   The rest of it is a pretty standard affair.  This is why I suggested the Asus:  - Bitchin battery life  - Very nice processor..the highest end i3 (this might not seem important to you but I'd compare it to a race between a tuner car {the i3} and a low end BMW 3 series {the i5}. This i3 will totally pwn the i5 in the lenovo)  - A Nvidia 425M. A graphics card where you can actually do some serious gaming. [Here's the review](http://www.notebookcheck.net/NVIDIA-Geforce-GT-425M.34152.0.html). Pay attention to the fps counts on the different games towards the bottom. This is a gpu I'd happily play Dragon Age on :)  - Bigger Harddrive. 320 gigs vs Asus' 500 gigs  - Bitchin Techsupport/Warranty  - Chiclet keyboard, light weight, and looks (though thats totally subjective).   The only superiority that I see the Lenovo has is that it has an eSATA port while the Asus only has 3 USB2.0 ports. But I' pretty sure thats not much of an issue for you.   **SO IN SUMMARY**:  I really really REALLY think you should get the Asus because it is simply more powerful than the Lenovo. That being said, it is more expensive, but I think its totally worth it. In fact, if I could, I'd sell my laptop right now for like $800, whore my self out for $200..then go buy that Asus fucking ASAP. But hey, its your money not mine.   Good luck with your choice! ",®

From Medscape Medical News Chocolate May Exacerbate Acne in Men Fran Lowry February 8, 2011 (New Orleans, Louisiana) — Bad news for chocolate lovers who are prone to acne — researchers report that the consumption of pure chocolate can exacerbate facial acne vulgaris within days in people who have a history of the skin disorder.  The finding runs counter to the results of earlier studies that reported no connection between chocolate and acne breakouts, said Samantha Block, a medical student at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, in Florida, who spoke here at the American Academy of Dermatology 69th Annual Meeting.  The studies that were fundamental to the notion that diet and acne are not related looked at acne outbreaks after the consumption of chocolate candy, which contains added ingredients such as milk, sugar, and nuts, Ms Block said.  ""No studies were found in the literature assessing the effects of pure chocolate, made of 100% cocoa, on acne, so we set out to see what effect pure chocolate might have on acne exacerbation,"" she said.  The study involved 10 healthy male subjects between 18 and 35 years of age with a history of facial acne vulgaris. The subjects had at least 1 but no more than 4 total facial acneiform lesions (comedones and papules without pustules, nodules, or cysts) at study entry, and were not allowed to use any over-the-counter or prescribed medications.  ""We limited our study to males because we didn't want any confounding influences of hormones that women might have around their menstrual cycle affecting our study,"" Ms. Block explained.  The subjects consumed 6 ounces of 100% Ghirardelli chocolate, which they washed down with a glass of water. They were instructed to maintain their usual diet for 1 week.  Lesion counts were assessed at baseline and on days 4 and 7.  The researchers found a statistically significant increase in the mean number of total acneiform lesions (comedones, papules, and pustules) on day 4 (P = .031) and on day 7 (P = .050), compared with baseline. There was also a trend toward increases in the mean number of noninflammatory comedones on days 4 (P = .058) and 7 (P = .067). There were no significant differences in the number of inflammatory lesions (papules and pustules) at any time point.  The study found a strong correlation between the amount of chocolate that was consumed and the amount of acneiform lesions that developed (r = 0.510 on day 4 and 0.608 on day 7).  Subjects also reported headache, nausea, gastrointestinal distress, vomiting, and diarrhea, Ms. Block noted.  ""I think these results show that 100% chocolate does exacerbate acne in individuals who are acne prone,"" she told Medscape Medical News. ""We are planning to continue this work and are recruiting patients for a randomized placebo-controlled trial.""  She explained the reasons for choosing Ghirardelli chocolate. ""We felt that if our subjects were going to eat chocolate, why don't we give them the best? Also, Ghirardelli makes a chocolate bar that is made with 100% pure cocoa. Not all the manufacturers have 100% chocolate.""  ""There is a possible mechanism here,"" F.W. (Bill) Danby, MD, a dermatologist in private practice in Manchester, New Hampshire, told Medscape Medical News after the presentation. ""There are theobromines in chocolate. I have no idea whether Ghirardelli chocolate has more theobromines than other chocolate, but I get more headaches from Ghirardelli chocolate than I do from Hershey's, so I wonder about that as a mechanism. That should be quantitated and investigated further.""  He added that the earlier work that found no link between chocolate consumption and acne was ""fuzzy,"" but everyday evidence would indicate otherwise. ""We all have patients who swear that their acne breakout was due to eating chocolate, so this may be a reason,"" he said.  Jonette Keri, MD, from the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, told Medscape Medical News that this study adds another piece to the puzzle of what causes acne to flare up.  ""We're getting closer and closer to figuring out how diet affects acne. I love this study because it's adding a piece to that puzzle, so I think it's important. I'm pleased that they are going to continue with a randomized trial,"" Dr. Keri, who moderated the session, said. She was not part of the study.  Ms. Block, Dr. Danby, and Dr. Keri have disclosed no relevant financial relationships.  American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) 69th Annual Meeting: Abstract 305. Presented February 6, 2011.

Graning worked for the Capital Area Rural Transportation System (CARTS) near Austin, Texas, for less than a year before he was let go in January. At the time, he told his supervisor that, ""in good conscience, he could not take someone to have an abortion,"" according to the lawsuit. Graning is an ordained Christian minister. Advertisement  &gt;Planned Parenthood, a health care provider that offers a range of medical services to women, including those related to abortion, often draws the ire of anti-abortion groups in the United States, where the procedure is legal but fiercely controversial.  [Omniscient Texas Bus Driver's Story Falls Apart](http://www.rightwingwatch.org/content/omniscient-texas-bus-drivers-story-falls-apart)  &gt;Of course, as I pointed out before, that facility offers a whole range of services from pregnancy and HIV tests to abstinence education.  So not only did Graning have absolutely no way of know why this woman wanted to go to this facility, his claim that the facility's message alerted him that abortions were performed there is flagrantly false.  &gt;Graning just assumed that this woman was going to Planned Parenthood to get an abortion and refused to take her.  For that, he was fired ... and became a Religious Right hero.   [Southern Border Brings Easy Access to Abortion-Inducing Drug:  Women in anti-choice states like Texas are turning to off-label drug use to induce abortions.](http://www.alternet.org/health/80551/southern_border_brings_easy_access_to_abortion-inducing_drug)  &gt;In Texas, abortion is legal in the first 25 weeks of pregnancy. Cameron County is one of the 7 percent of Texas counties with a clinic. Still, for local women the cultural pressure and economic barriers to abortion often outweigh the risks of swallowing an unprescribed pill.  &gt;Even a conservative estimate would double and possibly triple the number of abortions occurring in the area.   n Texas, women are required to receive information about abortion 24 hours in advance, a stipulation that some womenâ€™s health advocates say represents an economic and social barrier for many women too difficult to traverse.  â€œIf a woman has to drive 30 minutes, turn around and then do it again the next day, thatâ€™s two hours of driving, plus the appointment time that she canâ€™t easily hide,â€ said Jessica Gonzalez-Rojas, the director of policy and advocacy at the National Latina Institute for Reproductive Health.",™

Once there, we had seminars every semester about recognizing abuse (not just from priests, but in the general population) and Covering Your Ass™, and the seminary process has for a very long time required you to pass a vote every semester to remain in the program. It's a strong screening process, and the church isn't willing to let the priest shortage be cause for the next child rapist or Martin Luther or whatever.  As far as the abuses by the already ordained, that's more complicated. Excommunication is off the table, but that doesn't mean that nothing can be done. Some say the Vatican encouraged handling the problem internally. Some bishops might have simply been unwilling to take drastic measures. As for the bishop we had when I was in the seminary, he sent an abusive priest off to the monastery, but only after reassigning him once. He never did talk about why reassignment ended up not working out.  As a side note that's irrelevant to the point you were making, I'm not a Catholic, I'm an atheist.

First off, Ferrari has not made a pick up truck, or in fact any commercial vehicle. It has not in fact used the term F-150 at all. The term F150 has been used as an abbreviation for the official name of it's 2011 F1 racecar.

t5_2cneq,ATG77,1297405720,"First of all, the email dump was in retaliation of a personal vendetta from the justice department against Anonymous. Just as the Justice department didn't bother to worry about the civil liberties of spying on individuals in Anonymous, so too did Anonymous ignore the rights of privacy for those individuals who were attacking them. That to me seems like 'par-for-the-course' at this point.  The existence of what one might call ""a distributed network of anti-authority individuals"" such as Anonymous falls pretty far into anarchism on the spectrum of government activism, i will admit. However, activism in the form of a 'hive mind' such as this is not new; The term ""hive mind"" and the research regarding it extends well before the existence of the internet: the french revolution; the American revolution; the start of world war 1; most instances of racism and gentrification throughout history. These are instances where individuals who, while not necessarily doing things for the same personal reasons, all end up doing the same thing collectively. If you are thinking ""wait wait, those were consigned protests with the will of the collective people all following the same talking points"" I think you may be experiencing a bit of the hindsight bias. There was no way to explain to the entire illiterate french commonwealth how the french oligarchy was making trade difficult and consolidating political power; instead, chanting ""burn them all at the stake, and kill those Jewish money-lenders too!"" worked just as well.  Now, physiologically, non-human primates have similar reactions when they organize into subcultures within a population; many beta-males will group together to topple an alpha male, even knowing that only one of those beta males can end up as the new alpha. The non-human primate notion of 'common good' follows from within a sub-population judging the fittedness of the leader. You are perhaps mistaken if you think there is some societal standard for 'common good' in the world.   Not everyone's notion of the 'common good' is the same, or even comes from the same place. Most of the time, people are using incomplete information or can't see the bigger picture. 'Anonymous' is a group of frustrated, alienated, and marginalized technologists, who act for the sake of their own impression of the common good. I ask you how Egypt's government officials, or these security firms, or our own government's officials are any different? The common good of Anonymous aligns a whole hell of a lot more with normal everyday working people, and I think that probably scares you a bit. Just as companies like Nokia were worried as Apple released the iPhone.   &gt;Anonymous: the Apple™ of the activist world.   What? you'd prefer regular activism? Like signing petitions, lobbying, or labor unions? Well Anonymous is finding out how easy your regular activism can be hampered and dismantled, so perhaps some new activism will shake things up, if nothing else.  **tl;dr** Hive minds have existed throughout history and they are not a new concept in activism or social change. Non-human primates also engage in hive-mind-like behavior at times when leaders are perceived to not have the best interests of the community in mind. Anonymous has their own sense of collective justice about the world, and they act on it; just like collective individuals in regular activist groups or government organizations.",™

Let’s take two different diapers, one premium brand and one store brand.  Personally I’ve been just as happy with store brand as premium brand so in my mind they’re comparable quality.  * up &amp; up™ Diapers Club Box - Size 3 (144 Count) $19.99 - 13.8 cents per diaper  * Luvs Premium Stretch Diapers - Size 3 (204 count) $38.99 - 19.1 cents per diaper  The Luvs diapers are 5.3 cents more per diaper than the store brand.  Big deal, right?  But you’ve got 2 butts to diaper and you’re changing them an average of 8-10 times per day.  You may change more or less, but this is considered a pretty reasonable average by most baby resources.  Let’s go on the low side and say 8 changes per day.  Two babies, that’s 16 diapers per day.  Luvs costs you $3.05 per day.  Store brand costs you $2.20 per day. Luvs costs you 85 cents more per day than store brand.  Assume an average 30 day month.  Calculate 6 months of that cost difference. Luvs costs you $153 more just in the first 6 months alone.  $300 in the first year.  Maybe that’s no big deal but when you’re talking about an imperceptible quality difference it seems silly to throw away $300 on name brand diapers.  If you use daycare or give birth to an enthusiastic pooper that number of diapers is going to be on the high side, so assume 10 per day per baby.  In year one you’ll have spent more than $380 on diapers.  That’s almost $100 more in year 1 just by diapering each baby 2 more times per day.  For the record I did a per-ounce analysis of name brand versus store brand, too.  the difference calculated over a year was shocking. ",™

Eldora Gold anticipates, based on initial testing, that the auspicious debut (1/2 tonne per hour) of GravSep™ will result in not only the recovery of valued minerals, but also the rehabilitation of former tailings sites.

The GravSep™ is designed to be scalable, and is suited for small deposits less than 300,000 tonnes that cannot support permanent high capital cost equipment installations. The anticipated advantages for Eldora’s proprietary environmentally-friendly physical separation processing, which can be tailored to each specific deposit, now include potential for successful treatment and rehabilitation for many smaller size deposits using simple to maintain and operate equipment, as well as chemical-free processing.

This small quantity of Hydrogen has large effects on the combustion process.     * GT5 GreenCell Technologies: HYDROGEN USE AS A MOTOR FUEL       There are several ways that hydrogen can be used as a motor fuel. It can be used to directly replace gasoline or diesel fuel in specially designed internal combustion engines (ICEs), or it can be used to supplement these typical fuels in existing engines. In either of these cases, the vehicle drive system will be identical to those used on most gasoline-powered or diesel-powered vehicles. The engi     * Evolution of Wireless Technology       he First Generation (1G) of wireless communication is an analog type of technology wherein the signals are modulated to higher frequency to transmit signal from a mobile device to another via base station. Different standards were developed in different regions, to name a few - AMPS (Advanced Mobile Phone System) in US, NMT (Nordic Mobile Telephone) in Eastern Europe, TACS (Total Access Communications System) in United Kingdom.  The driver will instantly be aware if the HydroCell™ is in need of water and can rectify the condition which will minimize downtime.      The HydroCell™ requires the addition of water every 40 - 50 hours of operation and will shut down and not generate Hydrogen if allowed to run dry. This device will ensure maximum fuel savings by eliminating downtime due to lack of water.  HydroCell™ has exceeded expectations and is typically doubling hydrogen output and increasing fuel efficiencies for transportation companies and independent drivers alike.

Honestly, I think you've painted a pretty extreme picture for the sake of argument. In my experience, families that couldn't 'afford' to do anything for their animal were generally just as comfortable as any other working class family. Their animal's comfort just wasn't a priority - at least, not as high a priority as mum getting the newest iPhone. No doubt there are people in the situation you described, and my heart goes out to them (although I would argue there are alternatives to be found in community-funded shelters and vets, but that just opens up a whole new can of worms). The (fictional?) family in the comic isn't one of them - hence the whole, 'going away for the weekend and coming back to scrape up the dead cat' thing.  Additionally, I never mentioned anything about 'human hope' - and neither did the comic. It was purely about money. So please, spare me the sermon. The folk in the comic *went away for the weekend*, for God's sake (incidentally, how would providing pain meds for your suffering animal clash with *~*~♥*human hope*♥*~*~?).  Ignoring your next couple of paragraphs of what appears to be the purified essence of condescension, I think you and I just fundamentally have very different values concerning pet ownership. I believe that, if you wish to own an animal of some kind, you need to be prepared for expenses associated with pet ownership (yes, that includes vet expenses). You seem to believe it's all okay, as long as you're marginally more nurturing than the friggin' wild. That's not my thing.  ",♥

That apparently aren't capable of a coherent attack, settling for randomly fiddling things around on their character sheets. Let's set aside how awkward and gamist that is for a moment. Being beyond comprehension doesn't mean doing things that serve no purpose. Unless changing your name to ˜å˙∂˚ƒ®¢£≠ sets up for some unknowable plan it has, it's just pointless stoogery. It's almost the *opposite* of Lovecraftian.  I'm not telling you how to have fun. If you and your group like that, please enjoy. I'm just explaining why I would never do this.  **e**: As for old metalface, last Planescape game I ran, I made it a central point of the plot that ""she"" (really ""it"") is an entity of a far higher existence who escaped the Far Realm by using Ao (essentially a tool of her creation, a massive construct) to create a protective bubble  of adamantine around herself. Within this bubble she took refuge, sleeping and dreaming. In dreaming, she created reality, all of the planes, starting with Sigil. As reality is entirely fueled by her belief, all of reality *is* belief. Belief really *can* change the nature of a man, because that's ultimately all a man is. The concentrated belief of a religion can create a god from nothing, if necessary; gods are constructs of the concentrated belief of people (which are constructs of the Lady's belief).  This big bubble around reality was still outside of reality, though; one can't simply travel to the edge and touch it. It was outside time and space. The entities chasing the Lady in the first place set to shaking and rocking it, forcing parts of it to enter reality at random points and times. It would sometimes be found, and mined for the preciously rare and useful material that it is. Which means whenever one mined adamantine, no matter where or when, one weakened the bubble protecting space and time from the Far Realm.",®

t5_2qh1i,CallmeUgly,1297720709,"Basically, yes. But me and my OCD are going to make it more detailed than that ☺. The file system on a formatted hard disk drive keeps track of where every file is located. It's an index your computer refers to to locate a file that has been requested. Deleting a file deletes it's reference in that index so that it can't be found by normal means. None of the data that makes up the file itself is altered at all. Once it's reference in the file allocation table is removed, the space that the file inhabits is seen as free space by the operating system. Over time it may be incidentally overwritten, fully or partially. [Flash memory data location is more dynamic, primarily because of processes called wear leveling and garbage collection.] Or it may be recovered, fully or partially even if some time has passed. One of the simpler recovery tools is [Recuva](http://www.softpedia.com/get/System/Back-Up-and-Recovery/Recuva.shtml) (Options→Actions→Deep Scan).   An alternative to deleting, is getting a program that can overwrite a file on command. Unfortunately there aren't a lot of good options there. One is using the infrastructure of an already popular program like Spybot or Glary Utilities (where you'll have limited control over the overwriting method). Or getting a dedicated program like [Eraser](http://sourceforge.net/projects/eraser/), which will net you more control, but Eraser is very flawed (some systems need 5.xx to use context menu commands). There aren't a lot of good dedicated programs for this, and none that I'm really happy with.  Deleting browser history/cache is another concern. Especially for those that browse amateur porn(people have been prosecuted for having underage porn in the browser cache, though you'd have to warrant a seizure). Using [Ccleaner](http://www.softpedia.com/get/Security/Secure-cleaning/CCleaner.shtml) to erase browser cache/history/tracking cookies is preferable to ""Private Mode"" or having the browser delete them on close. Options→Settings→Secure Deletion→3-7 Passes will attempt to make those files unrecoverable. It will also handle all browsers at once to keep unwanted traces of activity from spouses, children, or coworkers.    For any software erasure method, it's been suggested to me that overwriting the free space on a drive is also necessary to be sure. I can't verify that though, and it takes as much time as to be completely impractical to do often. I wipe the free space every time I defrag.",☺

An average sized woman needs only 1800 cals to maintain weight (basal metabolic rate falling around 1500 cals), while an average sized somewhat active man requires only 2000-2200 cals. 3500 cal deficit required to lose 1 lb; so if you don't create a dietary deficit to pair with your exercise plan you're going to have some difficulty shedding anything beyond excess water-weight.

The interesting thing is that once you get rid of the huge number of frameworks and libraries, you no longer have the problem of having to manage a ridiculous number of dependencies. We just had a folder that looked something like this:      libs         gwt-presenter             jars         gwt-dispatch             jars         guice             jars         gin             jars  and so on.

We just included that directory on the classpath in our ant build, and it was done.  Maybe if you had a legitimately large number of dependencies, something like ivy or maven would make sense, but honestly, I only go looking for solutions to problems I *actually have*, and just using the simple scheme above... we didn't *have* any problems to go solving.

t5_6,SweetWurds4Hur,1297885823,"Here is the text, if you can't read on the page:  To My Angel,  As I sit here looking at the dead rose on my TV tray, so many thoughts and emotions are pulsing through my soul.  I’ve written so many song lyrics and poems and monologues in an effort to express myself to myself, and a few I’ve shared with you.  But not until now have I actually taken the initiative to try and translate “myself” to you directly, so bear with me if you’ve heard this one before (lol).  To begin with, I can’t find the words to explain how we gravitated toward one another so easily.   Perhaps it was physical, but I think maybe, no absolutely, we had a connection from the moment we met: You were coming in to check your schedule and I hadn’t met you yet – I remember being surprised by your presence (mesmerized by your eyes, really) and trying to play it down by asking you to pronounce your last name for me.  I know you remember this ☺.  The next thing I know, I’m having these amazing conversations with you on the beach – and it was then, long before “the kiss”, that I sensed something between us that awakened the possibility that love could be Real and Honest, yet Innocent and Sacred.  These are, as I see it, the pillars of what Love should be.  I have just never been fortunate enough to find these pillars supporting the same person – until now.  This, coming from a man who has a lifetime of experience on you – your lifetime, to be exact, presents a realization that to most would be counterintuitive. I mean what, as your father so poignantly put it (that is sarcasm, by the way), would a guy like me see in a girl like you?  The answer to that question, Katie (notice the proper spelling) lies in the fact that Love is not defined by the confines of “age” or “experience”; rather, Love is sustained by a belief in something Real, something Honest, something Innocent – something Sacred.  It is empathetic and everlasting.  And I believe we have found that with one another – regardless of the circumstances.  All of this being said, Love can take many forms: It can be a shoulder to cry on, a warm embrace, a laugh, a vent, or a friendly place (yes I am busting a rhyme right now) a dance with chance or a sweet romance, but don’t freelance the rants and you’ll enhance the trance.  Word.  You get the point.  While I don’t know what any of this means, really, in the “big picture”, what I do know is this: While we are clearly staring at what we could both agree is “bad timing”, it is not about being together -- I can love you on many levels and be perfectly happy.  For this is, after all,  about said big picture – and ultimately, and no matter what – I love you Katie.    I’m often amazed when I think about the ways you have affected me since we have known one another.  For one thing, you’ve given me a renewed confidence in being honest with myself and who I am, but more importantly, who I want to be.  Though I have been “exposed” many times over to various religious ideologies, you have reintroduced me to Jesus Christ in a way that has made me truly rethink the way I move forward in this world.  You are the epitome of Godliness: You are faithful without being judgmental, you are mindful without being meddling.  Your willingness to put the happiness of others in front of your own is a testament to your devotion to the Gospel.  I often find that YOU are my moral compass when I am faced with theoretical adversity.  To put it plainly: Your example has encouraged me to seek sanctuary with The Lord – and I am working on it on my own pace, but I am working on it.  Thank you.  It is with all of this in mind that I add my addendum about the conversation regarding your crush on Ricky (which, by the time you read this you will be way over, but it speaks to larger issue).  Allow me to make one thing clear:  My sentiments were not born from jealousy, but rather, betrayal.  Not on your part – he’s a good lookin’ guy with some musical talent, gay or not – I don’t blame you!  I was more disappointed with the possibility that, knowing what he knew about “us”, he would consider “going there”.   Having said this, I don’t want that to ever prevent you from sharing these types of things with me in the future.  Beyond all else,  “We” are above this: “We” care about each other’s happiness and that will always supersede. In other words, what we may or may not be in the future is not nearly as important, for me anyway, as what we can be for one another in the meantime.  You are my Angel, Katie, and I am your man.  No matter what.  I love you.  Thank you  for being in my life.  Love,  Me ",☺

This concentrate will contain the majority of the recoverable metallic values in these former tailings, as well as the majority of the minerals responsible for the adverse environmental consequences of the original tailings disposal.  The proprietary process includes the preparation of a recirculating water pond, whereby final tailing separation from pulping water will provide recirculating water for pulping fresh feed, thus no continuous use of fresh water is required. After pulping the excavated feed and pumping the pulp through the physical separation process, Eldora anticipates ultimately discharging a tailing material in a form suitable for environmental rehabilitation of the site.",™

t5_2cneq,mrmulyani,1298007051,"I've got no problems at at all with your response, but I hope you don't mind if I diverge a little (quietly assuming that it's just you and I reading this thread now ☺). Firstly I suggest that unless you are literally an exceptional human being, you are likely to waver on your 'convictions' if they are in disagreement with those for whom your reputation depends, or with those in authority. This is perfectly normal, as demonstrated by such things as Nazi Germany (and countless other regimes throughout history), the Milgram experiment, etc.  But the really interesting thing you said was your distinction between whether you are in power or under the control of others. To me, no matter how much power a person may be perceived as having, they are *always* under the control of others, should those others choose to exercise that power. Power, unless it happens to be backed by a personal doomsday device in one's pocket, is always dependent on those ultimately responsible for granting it to you. The recent revolutions throughout the Middle East and Northern Africa are an awesome demonstration of what happens when people realise this fact. It's just sad that we are so easily convinced that resistance is futile.  Finally, I have to say that I can have no admiration for a man whose distorted world view leads him to value the lives of mindless foetuses over, for example, the thousands of young people sent to die for nothing in countries they know nothing about.",☺

t5_2qh61,SolomonKull,1298055918,"&gt; Holy cow, man, lose the aggression.  No.  &gt; I am not ""one of those people,""   Completely irrelevant.  &gt; I have simply studied a number of religions extensively as they and their practitioners fascinate me, both philosophically and psychologically.   As have I, and that's why I know you're erroneously and contradictorily arguing for a theology you do not believe in.   &gt;  If anything, I consider myself an agnostic,  Agnostics are atheists by definition.  You don't believe that a god exists, and therefore are not a theist.  It's a logical fallacy I see among so-called agnostics all the time.  If you are not sure about the existence of a God then you do not believe that a God exists.  By default all agnostics are atheistic.  &gt; searching for the truth.  You claim...  &gt; I'm not trying to convince anyone, I'm just stating what modern Christians/Protestants believe.   By making the statement as if it were concrete suggests otherwise.  Stop trying to argue for a Protestant theology if you are not trying to convince people of it's arguments.  &gt;There are a number of different interpretations of Matthew 5:17, but the one I outlined above is the most prevalent among Protestants and is supported by the apostle Paul in his letters to the various churches (Ephesians 2:14-15, Romans 10:4), among others.  The theology of this cult bares no relevance to the contradictory nature of these Biblical quotes.  We have a clear contradiction between the so-called new laws and the old laws, and also a contradiction between the teachings of Jesus and the teachings of Saul/Paul.  This should make Christian theists ponder about the validity of not only Paul but of the entire Bible, and of the belief that it is a series of messages from an infallible deity.  &gt; If you're going to follow the Mosaic Law to the letter, I suggest you start by immediately putting to death anyone who breaks the Sabbath (Exodus 31:14), anyone who has cursed their parents (Lev 20:9), and anyone who murders another.   I'm not going to follow the laws of a bunch of barbaric, desert dwelling maniacs.  However, if one is to be consistent in their delusions then they need to accept that Jesus clearly states the old law is eternal and that these commandments from YHWY are a *must* for Abrahamic theists.  &gt;The Mosaic Law was supposed to be impossible to follow.   [citation needed]  &gt; The antithesis of ""abolish"" that Jesus mentioned is not ""abide by,"" but is ""fulfill.""  Fulfillment of these commandments does not negate the fact that they are eternal.      Matthew 28:20 (New International Version, ©2010)      20 and teaching them to obey everything I have      commanded you. And surely I am with you always,     to the very end of the age.”  See that?  Obey *everything forever*.  What did Jesus say in John 14:15? He said, `""If you love me, you will obey what I command.""`   Matthew concludes his gospel with the same thought about obeying Jesus' commandments. Here he says: `""Go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you""` in Matthew 28:19-20.  If Jesus is YHWY then YHWY's laws are eternal.  Period.  If the Mosaic Laws are to be done away with, then why does the Bible say that Jesus said `""And he charged him to tell no man: but go, and shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing, according as Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them""`?  &gt; Jesus is the hope that the Jews had...  No.  &gt; Jesus is the hope that the Jews had for final salvation  Nope.  &gt;Jesus is the hope that the Jews had for final salvation from their imperfection   Have you even read /Jewish/ theological books?  &gt; Jesus is the hope that the Jews had for final salvation from their imperfection that enslaved them to all the insane laws of the Old Testament.  Jesus did not change these laws.  Period.   &gt; The OT will never go away and and still very important source of teaching, historical data, and perspective on just how much the sacrifice of Jesus matters to the Christians.   The OT is neither a book of fact nor a history book.  Many of the so-called historical details of the books in the OT are demonstrably not true.  This is not debatable among the educated.  Also, the ""sacrifice"" of Jesus has nothing to do with the OT, as  anyone who reads the Messianic prophecies can see - Jesus does *not* fulfill them.  Read that again, Christians.  Jesus does *not* fulfill the Messianic prophecies.   &gt;  But the laws concerning ceremonial ""cleanliness"" and ""uncleanliness,"" etc., are fulfilled and no longer required under the New Covenant (Mark 7:19 is an example, Matthew 22:37-40 is another).  Glad you mention Matthew 22:40, `All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments.”` All of the laws.  Not some of the laws...ALL OF THE LAWS.  Regarding Mark 7:19.....  In the New Testament, Jesus never once even hinted that all meats were made clean. For example, in Mark 7 the entire context of the chapter is a vital concept involving our MIND and not physical food. The first rule of Bible Study is to study scriptures in their context, and not to pull them out of context to try to establish a doctrine or point of truth.  Mark 7:1-13 shows Christ chastising the Jews for being hypocrites (verse 6), and thinking more about their picky do's and don'ts (like washing ceremonially, verse 3), rather than matters such as honoring your parents (verse 10).  Then in Mark 7:14-16 Jesus spoke a parable to the people stating that taking in a bit of dirt when you eat without washing your hands cannot defile you (verse 15). But it is that which comes OUT of a man that defiles him. Since the disciples didn't understand the parable, Jesus, in verses 17-23, explained to them that ingesting some food with a bit of dirt on it couldn't harm them at all, because it doesn't enter the mind, rather it passes through the normal bodily function (verses 18-19). This has *absolutely nothing* to do with clean and unclean meats.  &gt; As for the Ten Commandments, all are repeated by Jesus in the New Testament with the exception of one: keep the Sabbath.  If Jesus if YHWY then all commandments are eternal.  We have already established this.  Not mentioning one of these laws does not negate the law.    &gt; So one's expected conduct does not change, only the penalties for sinning.  [citation needed]  &gt; As you have so aptly demonstrated, the world would be a better place without religion: less hate, less indignation, less conflict, and less judgment.   I'm not religious, just educated on the subject.    &gt; People will always have different opinions than you.  We're talking about textual *facts*, not opinions.  One can have opinions on the facts, but the subject matter here deals with facts not opinion.  Citing our sources is proof of that.  &gt;  It's best that you make peace with that fact.  Meh.",©

t5_2qpp6,Slust,1298334818,"I spent so much effort on this post then the guy deleted it.  =/  SOMEONE MUST SEE IT!  ♥  Going to continue this trend of disagreeing with community proposed balance changes for Zerg.  =p  At least this time I'll bring some math to the table.  OMFG TEXT CRIT INC!  So giving Mutalisks +1 Armor will give them +100% initial starting mitigation, as well as +25% maximum mitigation.  This is something that really needs to be considered, especially at the point in the game when Mutas can first take to the skies, as well as the rest of the game (scaling with upgrades and additional numbers).  A Mutalisk has 120hp and +1 Armor to start with.  It does a base 9/3/1 damage (initial + glaive bounce) every 1.5246GTS.  A Mutalisk will attack 39 times (if non-stop) in a minute, which totals out to 351 damage in just the initial hit over a minute.  Divided by 60 (seconds), this totals out to 5.85DPS.  (Again, just the initial hit only)  A Stalker has 160EHP and +1 Armor to start with.  It does a base 10 damage every 1.44GTS.  A Stalker will attack 41 times (if non-stop) in a minute, which totals out to 410 damage in a minute.  Divided by 60 (seconds), this totals out to 6.83DPS.  Now both units have +1 innate Armor, so let's calculate out the math.  **Mutalisk vs Stalker:  ((9 - 1) * 39) / 60 = 5.2DPS**  **Stalker vs Mutalisk:  ((10 - 1) * 41) / 60 = 6.15DPS**  But if we add in another +1 Armor to Mutalisks, the numbers come out to:  **Mutalisk vs Stalker:  ((9 - 1) * 39) / 60 = 5.2DPS**  **Muta 1st Bounce:  ((3-1) * 39) / 60 = 1.2DPS**  **Muta 2nd Bounce:   (1 * 39) / 60 =  0.65DPS (you can't mitigate damage out to equal 0)**  **Stalker vs Mutalisk:  ((10 - 2) * 41) / 60 = 5.46DPS**  Now both the Mutalisk and the Stalker are doing almost the same DPS on the initial hit.  Then factor in the bounce DPS and the Muta is doing 7.05DPS, which is more than Stalkers do against Mutas without the additional +1 Armor.  Now let's see what happens when we have 10 Mutalisks and 10 Stalkers duking it out, pre-additional armor that was suggested.  We'll total up their HP and DPS to see a rough collective vs collective scenario.  **As Is:**  Mutalisks - (120 * 10) = 1200HP  ||  ((5.2 + 1.3 + 0.65) * 10) = 71.5DPS  Stalkers - (160 * 10) = 1600HP  ||  (6.15 * 10) = 61.5DPS  Conflict Outcome:  It would take the Mutalisks about 22.4 seconds worth of full DPS to do 1600 damage (with some variance given to Glaive killing some units at a non-static rate).  It would take the Stalkers about 19.5 seconds to do 1200 damage.  Given that the Stalkers would win straight up, the Mutalisks would only do about 1394.25 worth of damage, which would leave about 2 Stalkers still standing.  (""Average"", there is about 1.28 worth of Stalker HP left, so there could be 2 Stalkers with 102HP or 3 Stalkers with 68HP.  Remember, these are just math fights, not simulations!)  **Post Suggestion:**  Mutalisks - (120 * 10) = 1200HP  ||  ((5.2 + 1.3 + 0.65) * 10) = 71.5DPS  Stalkers - (160 * 10) = 1600HP  ||  (5.46 * 10) = 54.6DPS  Conflict Outcome:  It would take the Mutalisks about 22.4 seconds worth of full DPS to do 1600 damage (with some variance given to Glaive killing some units at a non-static rate).  It would take the Stalkers about 21.9 seconds to do 1200 damage.  Given that the Stalkers would win straight up, the Mutalisks would do 1565.85 worth of damage.  Holy shit, giving Mutalisks another +1 Armor would make them do a total of 1566 damage against an equal size Stalker ball, instead of 1395.  But here's the kicker, these are just math fights, I'm pretty sure the Mutalisks would win due to the glaive bounce.  The reason being is that the Stalkers would do consistent damage against the Mutalisks, but the Mutalisks would not do consistent damage against the Stalkers; I don't know if there is any math behind the bounce formula, but if every single glaive attack hit the same Stalker on the first bounce (taking 20 damage every 1.5246GTS) and the same Stalker takes the second bounce (Taking 10 damage every 1.5246GTS), those two Stalkers would die sooner, which drops the total DPS curve for the Stalker collective - that buys the Mutalisks more time to do their damage, and as the math fight suggests, since it's so close already, 10 Mutas would trump 10 Stalkers.  Then don't forget to factor in the Mutalisk's speed and agility (air unit with a speed of 3.75) and now it doesn't seem a bit too much?  **TL;DR Version (aka: I don't want to read math)** - You can test this scenario yourself by making a custom map with 10 Mutalisks with +2 Armor and 10 Stalkers with +1 Armor and Blink, then position them close so they're not attacking, then Blink the Stalkers in range and see what happens.  Also, with the Baneling speed upgrade, Banelings are not as fast as Stimmed Marines.  But they are *on creep*!  Read:  Giving Banelings a base speed 2.9531 (the speed with the speed upgrade), then stacking the speed on top of that would make them 3.4062 (versus Stimmed Marines 3.375).  But then if you factor in the Creep speed bonus (30%), they would move 4.42806.  They would be the fastest unit in the game (Phoenix has 4.25 speed, for reference) and become too effective on Creep.",♥

I am many things—and I am one thing. But I am not a thing that is just lying around somewhere, like a pen, or a toaster, or a housewife. That is for sure. I am much more than that. I am a living, breathing thing, a thing that can draw with a pen and toast with a toaster and chat with a housewife, who is sitting on a couch eating toast. And still, I am much more.  &gt;I am a man.  &gt;And I am a former baby and a future skeleton, and I am a distant future pile of dust. I am also a Gemini, who is on the cusp.  &gt;I am “brother” and I am “son” and I am “father” (but just according to one person, who does not have any proof but still won’t seem to let it go). Either way, I am moving very soon and not letting her know about it. I am asking you to keep that between us.  &gt;I am trustworthy and loyal, but at the same time I am no Boy Scout. No, I am certainly not. I am quite the opposite, in fact. And by opposite I do not mean Girl Scout. No. I mean Man Scout. And by that I do not mean Scout Leader. In fact, I am not affiliated with the Scouts at all. Let’s just forget about the Scouts and Scouting altogether, O.K.?  &gt;I am concepts and thoughts and feelings and outfits. And I am each of these all at once, unless I am in the shower. Then I am not outfits, because that would be uncomfortable.  &gt;To some I am known as Chief. And these are usually people who work in Radio Shack or try to sell me shoes. To others I am known as Buddy. These are people who dwell in bars and wonder if I’ve got a problem or what it is that I am “looking at.” And to still others, who are in that same bar, standing just off to the side, I am “Get Him!”  &gt;I am he and I am him. I am this and I am that. And I am, from time to time, Roberta, if I am in a chat room.  &gt;People have known me by many titles. In high school, I was Student and Key Club Vice-President and Queer Bait. In college, I was Pledge and then Disappointed and then Transfer Student. I am still amazed at how picky certain so-called “brotherly” organizations can be. And I am actually glad that they didn’t choose me for their stupid fraternity.  &gt;To some I am fantasy, and to others I am Frank, mostly because I have told them that this is my name—even though it is not even close to my name. I am a mystery wrapped in an enigma wrapped in a pita. Why the pita? That counts as another mystery.  &gt;I am everything and I am nothing. I am just kidding; I am not everything and nothing. That would be ridiculous. I am just everything.  &gt;I am what I eat. And I am this especially when I bite my nails.  &gt;I have been called Hey, You! and Get Out of the Way! and Look Out! And then, some time later, Plaintiff.  &gt;I am my own worst critic. I am going to give you an example. “That’s not me enough” is the kind of thing I am prone to say about myself. See what I mean? I am sure you do.  &gt;I am the silent majority.  &gt;I am a loud minority.  &gt;I am not talking about Puerto Ricans when I say that, because I am not a racist. I am just clearing that up. In fact, I am pretty sure I have at least one friend from each of the races (Hi, Guillermo).  &gt;I am friend. I am foe. I am fo’ sho’. What up, y’all?  &gt;I am sorry about that. I was just talking to one of my race friends, a black one. I am white and I am black. And I am both of these when I am dressed as a mime. And then I am sh-h-h.  &gt;I am Batman, but only on Halloween. And then I am not invited to many parties. But I am fine with that, because that just makes me an even more accurate Batman (because Batman does not go to parties as Batman but only as Bruce Wayne). I am right about this.  &gt;I am someone who likes to go to the park. But I am not the guy with the Labrador retriever and the tennis ball and the tattered book under his arm, who is wearing fleece and is kind of tan. No. I am not that guy. I am sick of that guy and all the women who talk to him.  &gt;I am the Walrus, but not the one you’re probably thinking of. I am the Other Walrus, the one who is less the Walrus in the sense of legendary music and more the Walrus in the sense of his tendency to lie around on a beach for too long.  &gt;I am bravery. I am courage. I am valor. I am daring. I am holding a thesaurus.  &gt;I am the sun. I am the moon. I am the rain, I am the earth. I am these when I am taking mushrooms with Kevin. I am good friends with Kevin. I am not sure what Kevin’s last name is.  &gt;I am sometimes referred to as Excuse Me in an annoyed tone of voice, because apparently I am in the way. I am so sorry. I am supposed to be some sort of mind reader, I guess. I am moving out of the way now as slowly as I possibly can. I am doing this and there’s nothing you can do about it.  &gt;I am often the one they call You but I am no more You than you. I am me. And I am more Me than you are or can ever be. And one time I was Corey for almost five minutes while I was talking with a stranger, until she realized that I was not her friend Corey.  &gt;I am neither here nor there, but there—a little to the left. Yeah. That’s me.  &gt;I am waving at you. I am waving right at you now.  &gt;I am looking right at you.  &gt;I am sensing that you don’t know me.

Modulo is Latin for ""with respect to the modulus"".  In this example the modulus is 6.  So I think my choice of variable name, `@modulus`, is appropriate in that respect.  Although [The Free Dictionary](http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/modulo) suggests that: 'The % symbol is the modulo, or ""modulus"" operator', I'm inclined to agree with you that 'modulo' is more correct, e.g. '42 mod 6' would be pronounced as 'forty-two modulo six'.   But either way, the operand on the RHS of the operator is always the modul*us*.   Incidentally, your comment made me think of a minor improvement that could be made:      - print $modulus[$n % 6]-&gt;($n), "" "";     + print $modulus[$n % @modulus]-&gt;($n), "" "";  This relies on Perl returning the size of an array when used in scalar context (`$size = @items`).  If at some point in the future we decide to change the modulus then we only need to add the new conditions to the `@modulus` array and the above code will Just Work™. ",™

t5_2cneq,anonymous-coward,1298399300,"&gt; In China, people save 40% of their income.  China is a weird case in many ways.  People are *forbidden* from spending on foreign goods, because dollars are confiscated and turned into renminbi at the country-wide level.  The savings boom is being concentrated into housing ([65 million empty apartments](http://seekingalpha.com/article/238912-how-big-is-the-chinese-property-bubble)).   This high savings rate is not really sustainable, because, for savings to make sense,  saved money has to go into some productive enterprise. Very high savings means cheap lending for productive enterprises, but it also means very low demand for goods (no one is buying stuff).     Savings is useful in shifting present utility to future utility to the extent it replaces short-term hedonistic consumption with long-term productive investment. It does this by driving down interest.   But if interest rates are not what is hobbling productivity, then savings won't help.  Today, interest rates are low.  &gt; This article explains the causes of cost increases in health care: http://www.cato.org/pubs/pas/pa211.html  It says:  &gt; The major culprit in the seemingly endless rise in health care costs is found to be the removal of the patient as a major participant in the financial and medical choices that are currently being made by others in the name of the patient. The increasing share of medical bills paid by third-party payers (insurance companies and governments) and the disastrous consequences are documented. Patients overuse medical resources since those resources appear to be free or almost free. Producers of medical equipment create new and more expensive devices, even if they are of only marginal benefit, since third-party payers create a guaranteed market. Attempts to rein in those costs have led to a blizzard of paperwork but proven ineffective in controlling costs.  Yes, this is a big problem.  The problem is that the public demands this.  *""We want a $35000 fizzulator even if it keeps grandma alive for just another month""*.  The article rails against 'excessive' medical treatment, defined as marginal cost exceeding marginal utility.  I think they're right.  But this effect occurs at the terminal, life-ending end of the spectrum.  Good luck persuading people to let daddy die 13.2 days earlier by denying them Eli Lilly's *Worthlex®*.  And they suggest:  &gt; The Patient Power plan would allow patients to selfinsure (meaning that patients themselves pay for the treatment of their illnesses) for many potential medical bills through medical savings accounts that would go hand in hand with the tax changes. It typically costs an employer more than $4,800 to provide health insurance for a worker, her spouse, and two children. Under the Patient Power plan, employers would purchase *only catastrophic policies* for workers, and workers would deposit the savings in premiums in medical savings accounts.  But a problem I see  is that much of the expense occurs at the catastrophic end of the spectrum.  [Most people don't consume *any* serious medical care: the lower 50% consumes just 3% of care!](http://www.ahrq.gov/research/ria19/expendria.htm)  So this $4800 is lost from the medical economy, when today it typically goes to the sick (or perhaps the overspending semi-sick).   And the 'only catastrophic policies'  mentioned as a footnote is where the real money is spent, if catastrophic includes expensive chronic conditions.   Then what about old people?  Eventually, they all go 'catastrophic'.    In other words, implementing this idea of marginal utility seems reasonable, but it is going to require denying care to some pretty sick people, on the basis that X months of their lives are not worth $Y.    And this difficulty really has nothing to do with government intervention.   ",®

For I am the the only human Fart Wizard left on Earth (note: this is COMPLETELY different than Ass Wizard. Very VERY different).

(aside: [fuck you Kurt Vonnegut](http://www.quotationspage.com/quote/39857.html). I'll use a semicolon if I want to)   Let me know if you would like to be a part of this amazing scientific breakthrough and get in on the ground floor of this unprecedented business opportunity. You will be the ""Patient Zero.""    You will visit my Fart Lab for your a dose of Shit Vapor Therapy or SVP as we'll call it. Right before you go to sleep you will put on the [""Rectal Alchemy Mask""](http://i.imgur.com/2ftCM.jpg) (patent pending you thieving swines!). Begin to count backwards from 500. Then you will slumber...blind to the horrors your body will shortly be forced to endure.   At this point I will begin forging the vaporized trouser serum in my own personal apothecary (read: my tummy). Using the same principles and conditions a sedimentary rock is transformed into a metamorphic rock, I will take our base ingredients (Chipotle and possibly Thai food. We'll iron out the exact chemistry by the time of our first trial...SCIENCE!) and break them down to a molecular level; to the ESSENCE OF LIFE...farts. What usually takes Mother Gaia (or Jesus or Allah or Vishnu or Nicholas Cage depending on your own beliefs) thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of years to educe...I will do in minutes using heat levels akin to Earth's molten iron core (about 5000°C ) and pressures that would crush even the most technologically advanced deep sea submersibles.

After producing an adequate supply, I will 'dock' to your mask with tubes made by NASA to withstand the heat and pressure of reentering Earth's atmosphere. Then, OH THEN, I will begin to slowly administer the fetid narcotic.  As you inhale the gas into your respiratory system and directly into your brain, you will be rendered unconscious and I hypothesize (with my professional farting experience in mind) your body will initially begin to reject the treatment. It will immediately detect the gas's sinister composition and use any and all defenses in it's repertoire. You will go into Anaphylactic shock, your internal temperature will reach upwards of 115 degrees F, you will begin to sweat profusely and convulse/seize. At this point I will stick a wooden salad spoon in your mouth to make sure you do not bite off your tongue and suffocate on your own blood. No doubt you will involuntarily begin to projectile vomit and shotgun blast diarrhea at an alarming rate, completely covering my lab with feces and bile. Fear not, for I will have already hooked you up to a [banana bag](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana_bag) so you will most likely survive the initial trials which may last upwards of 36 hours. However, might I suggest you to do some prior training to ready yourself for this experience. I suggest chewing on the anal scent glands of a skunk (I got a guy) while jazzercising at a fat rendering plant.   At this juncture, you will now be mainlining 100% pure fart. From the results of this experiment, a new element will inevitably be introduced to the periodic table. It will be element INFINITY and will be placed above Hydrogen as the new building block of life; the central proton containing the Higgs Boson with one orbiting muon. It will be known as Death Breath or DB for short.  As your whole body harmonizes with the great gas god (suck it, Jupiter), you will become one ethereal being. The whole process, I imagine, will be similar to when Ed Harris' character in the Abyss gets in that water astronaut suit and starts breathing placenta smoothies or whatever. YOU WILL FINALLY BE WHOLE. YOU WILL BREATHE FOR THE FIRST TIME.   As demigods are impervious to almost all human diseases and conditions, you will no longer suffer from depression. You will also have superhuman strength and the ability to fly (using farts as propulsion). You are now free to do whatever you want with your newfound powers, however the only thing that I ask of you is to track down that LYING SAIGON HOOKER AND RIP HER IN HALF LIKE A PHONEBOOK.

t5_6,thedanieljsmith,1298491777,"Look at the title, and think about whether or not you pay attention to everything said to you in a given day; or do you hear only what you want and fill in the blank spaces with noise?  In a job such as recruiting or sales, the ears are almost more important than the eyes when it comes to making decisions. Any time a decision needs to be made; it is best made when all the information is at hand, and that no nuances or misinterpretation is at hand. I have a calendar at home, and one of the pictures depicts a rabbit with his fingers in his ears saying “I’m not ignoring you, I’m listening to my fingers”. While this seems funny, as I thought more about it, I realised that there are alot of decisions made without having enough information, and by having enough information, I mean by listening to all the facts before reacting.  Our days are made up of a lot of little conversations with people, be it in person or over many possible ways on the internet, or on the phone, that it is possible to confuse conversations, or swear you heard something from someone that was never said.  Hmmmm…. If we hear all we are told, and we listen to all that is said to us…..How is this possible? Simple….in a nutshell….we didn’t listen completely to the thought expressed, or digest it completely before reacting.  In our zeal to please those around us, oftentimes we react to things before we take the time to act on them. Its this knee-jerk reaction that often leads us into trouble where there really wasn’t any forming.  This could eventually cause enough bad blood between people that countries would go to war for honour, rather than just admit that they didn’t hear the entire statement which they were being told.  In sales, something that simple could cost us a much valued client, or a deal which we had spent a lot of time working on, or worse even a shot to the reputation which will take a long time to fix.(if ever)  Trust is key; so is hearing everything before taking action.  That can be the hardest part of the equation, as most people are wired to lash out at WHAT THEY THINK has been said; when in reality no such thing had been said or even intimated.  For those of us in the “people business”, its easy to get caught up in the moment, and judge or defend someone or something without having the right information, or getting involved in an issue or help out in a consultation or a sale without being asked. Giving information prematurely, or at all when it is not needed is grounds for creating a bad situation when it doesn’t need to happen.  We get involved because we think we are helping. Great if we were asked, not so if we weren’t.  Think about all the occasions where getting involved cost you something you never should have lost.  Was it worth it in the end?  Probably not….Maybe next time, Listen to the entire statement and then act on it, and not on what you think was said…..Something To Think About…..  ©2011 The Daniel J.

t5_2fwo,tarballs_are_good,1298515429,"While the work has copyright by default, as you emphasized so clearly, the copyright line is still incorrect. I point this out because it is an important thing, especially for older works.  Before 1978, it was necessary to have a copyright notice otherwise the author waived all rights to their work. On January 1, 1978, the 1976 Copyright Act (title 17, *U.S. Code*) was enacted, and the 1988 Berne Convention Implementation Act modified the Copyright Act as to not make it a *requirement*. The Berne Conventions were enacted March 1, 1989.  The 1976 Copyright Act very clearly states what constitutes a **proper copyright notice**. In a nutshell, it states the following should appear ""in close proximity"" or ""together"" with the copies.  1. First, symbol ©; the word ""Copyright""; or the abbreviation ""Copr.""  2. The year of publication.  3. The name of the copyright owner, or some abbreviation or designation thereof.  In all, we have the templates:      © [year] [holder]     Copyright [year] [holder]     Copr. [year] [holder]  The position of the notice is also important, as specified by 37 C.F.R. 201.20 ""Methods of Affixation and Positions of the Copyright Notice on Various Types of Works"". The comic falls into three categories:    - Single-leaf work   - Other serial   - Machine readable work   - Pictorial work  The end of the comic is fine for each of these.  Now, the 1976 Copyright Act was never nullified, just modified. As such, there is still a clear definition of what a valid notice is. The act clearly states that a notice which  1. does not contain ©/Copyright/Copr.,  2. does not contain a date,   3. does not contain a name,  4. is dated more than one year after publication,  5. does not contain the notice as a part of the work itself, or  6. does not put the notice in a reasonable location, as defined in the Act  constitutes an **error in the notice** and is equivalent to omitting the notice entirely.  Again, I'll emphasize that since the enforcement of the Berne Convention, this does not compromise the fact that the holder retains copyright. However, the Copyright Act was not nullified, and therefore there is a clear meaning of a ""proper copyright [notice]"".  So, I'd think twice if I was really ""wrongity wrong wrong wrong"".",©

The entire thing is jam-packed with clauses that *cannot* be enforced.  You'd think that if Sony thought their EULA was sufficient to sue, they would actually sue for breeching it.  Instead they are suing geohot for computer fraud, and tried to use the EULA to show intent.  All EULA's basically say the company owns your immortal soul, the company can change the terms at any time, you consent to binding arbitration and waive your right to seek legal compensation, yadda yadda yadda.  And yet there's an entire field of contract law set up to explore how binding contracts interact with consumer protection laws, so far the protection laws have been upheld.  Modifying your console isn't illegal.  Reverse engineering your console isn't illegal, consumer rights trump the EULA.  The only potentially legally hazardous part is distributing the tools to let others do the same, something that isn't (and in fact cannot be) covered by Sony's EULA.

Oh, you know the sort... had a good home life, a loving mother and doting father that loved each other, learned to read at an early age and lived her life in books where the rebellious but strong willed heroine proved everyone wrong and found her prince charming in the end.   All her life, she was surrounded with a support system of friends and family who loved her and told her that her dreams will come true if she works hard enough... and this, of course, included her dashing prince with the chestnut eyes, chiseled brow and strong, aristocratic chin. The sort of man who would be the first out of the boat when storming the beaches, and the first to cry a tear when the sick child in her favorite film passed away; the early to bed, early to rise sort who shared her interests and all of her tastes, only drank beer to fit in with his buddies (and always just one), and worked happily at a job he loved, all the while considering it a privilege to come home exhausted at night, hand her his paycheck, then tell her how delicious the meal she ""just threw together"" tasted before going to bed in his Macy's pajamas (that she had bought him with his own money and he *always* wore), neither needing nor initiating sex except when she was in the mood... he just knew her that way.  ...problem is, she never met him.  Oh, she thought she had a time or two... but it was a case of perpetual close but not quite.   ...great job, great personality... but liked to get drunk with his friends on the weekend...  ...shared a ""kindred soul"" with her when it came to love, interests, and communications... but he had no *ambition*...  ...plenty of money and all the ambition in the world... but she just wasn't into the kinky stuff he liked...  Days turned into weeks and weeks turned into the whole of her youth as crows left marks upon her face the way disappointment left cynicism in her heart. Time after time... close, but not quite.

Yes, we know, it took several expansions to finally make this change that could probably have been done merely by changing a few lines of code. Aren't we clever?  **Druid:** A fix to Solar Beam  **Death Knight:** A fix so that Death Strike self-healing no longer generates Threat.  **Paladins:** Significant survivability/healing over-nerfs to Protection and Retribution through an enforced 20 second cooldown to Word of Glory. I would now say ""Respec Holy or reroll an actual damage dealing class that doesn't play like a Fisher Price™ My First Damage Dealing Class and hits about as hard as one."")  Face it, Paladins no longer have a niche seeing as we nerfed Selfless Healing **TO THE GROUND BABY**, and knowing our development priorities, we will probably not buff Ret or Prot damage to even remotely compensate for the loss of this niche until the next expansion.

The best advice would be to level Enchanting to 525, shard all your gear, AH the shards and any other valuables you still have and transfer it to a new character.  **Rogues:** Significant buffs to Stealth. Insgnificant nerfs to Recuperate. Don't worry, Mercader will still be making videos proving how overpowered the Rogue class is, and will probably solo 5 of every single class and spec by the time we finally get off our lazy arses and nerf Recuperate to a more balanced level.  **Warriors:** Buff to Arms damage and a Last Stand Shout. Too bad their mobility is still buttfucked. Also, for some retarded reason, Intercept and Charge only stun for 1 second again. Collossus Smash nerfed at long fucking last.  **Mage:** Fire nerf that turns out to be a buff due to the ad hoc way that Ignite actually procced off of periodic Fire effects.

Your inverted fourier transformation idea is possible, but make sure you don't take it of any feline animals you happen to have present, results have been inconsistent and it's generally not recommended.

t5_6,xbris,1298661010,"okay this is a little dated but:  &gt;Clinton has signed a bill passed by Congress that orders the states to adopt new, more onerous drunk-driving standards or face a loss of highway funds. That’s right: the old highway extortion trick. Sure enough, states are already working to pass new, tighter laws against Driving Under the Influence, responding as expected to the feds’ ransom note.  &gt;Now the feds declare that a blood-alcohol level of 0.08 percent and above is criminal and must be severely punished. The National Restaurant Association is exactly right that this is absurdly low. The overwhelming majority of accidents related to drunk driving involve repeat offenders with blood-alcohol levels twice that high. If a standard of 0.1 doesn’t deter them, then a lower one won’t either.  &gt;But there’s a more fundamental point. What precisely is being criminalized? Not bad driving. Not destruction of property. Not the taking of human life or reckless endangerment. The crime is having the wrong substance in your blood. Yet it is possible, in fact, to have this substance in your blood, even while driving, and not commit anything like what has been traditionally called a crime.  &gt;What have we done by permitting government to criminalize the content of our blood instead of actions themselves? We have given it power to make the application of the law arbitrary, capricious, and contingent on the judgment of cops and cop technicians. Indeed, without the government’s ""Breathalyzer,"" there is no way to tell for sure if we are breaking the law.  &gt;Sure, we can do informal calculations in our head, based on our weight and the amount of alcohol we have had over some period of time. But at best these will be estimates. We have to wait for the government to administer a test to tell us whether or not we are criminals. That’s not the way law is supposed to work. Indeed, this is a form of tyranny.  &gt;Now, the immediate response goes this way: drunk driving has to be illegal because the probability of causing an accident rises dramatically when you drink. The answer is just as simple: government in a free society should not deal in probabilities. The law should deal in actions and actions alone, and only insofar as they damage person or property. Probabilities are something for insurance companies to assess on a competitive and voluntary basis.  &gt;This is why the campaign against ""racial profiling"" has intuitive plausibility to many people: surely a person shouldn’t be hounded solely because some demographic groups have higher crime rates than others. Government should be preventing and punishing crimes themselves, not probabilities and propensities. Neither, then, should we have driver profiling, which assumes that just because a person has quaffed a few he is automatically a danger.  &gt;In fact, driver profiling is worse than racial profiling, because the latter only implies that the police are more watchful, not that they criminalize race itself. Despite the propaganda, what’s being criminalized in the case of drunk driving is not the probability that a person driving will get into an accident but the fact of the blood-alcohol content itself. A drunk driver is humiliated and destroyed even when he hasn’t done any harm.  &gt;Of course, enforcement is a serious problem. A sizeable number of people leaving a bar or a restaurant would probably qualify as DUI. But there is no way for the police to know unless they are tipped off by a swerving car or reckless driving in general. But the question becomes: why not ticket the swerving or recklessness and leave the alcohol out of it? Why indeed.  &gt;To underscore the fact that it is some level of drinking that is being criminalized, government sets up these outrageous, civil-liberties-violating barricades that stop people to check their blood – even when they have done nothing at all. This is a gross attack on liberty that implies that the government has and should have total control over us, extending even to the testing of intimate biological facts. But somehow we put up with it because we have conceded the first assumption that government ought to punish us for the content of our blood and not just our actions.  &gt;There are many factors that cause a person to drive poorly. You may have sore muscles after a weight-lifting session and have slow reactions. You could be sleepy. You could be in a bad mood, or angry after a fight with your spouse. Should the government be allowed to administer anger tests, tiredness tests, or soreness tests? That is the very next step, and don’t be surprised when Congress starts to examine this question.  &gt;Already, there’s a move on to prohibit cell phone use while driving. Such an absurdity follows from the idea that government should make judgments about what we are allegedly likely to do.  &gt;What’s more, some people drive more safely after a few drinks, precisely because they know their reaction time has been slowed and they must pay more attention to safety. We all know drunks who have an amazing ability to drive perfectly after being liquored up. They should be liberated from the force of the law, and only punished if they actually do something wrong.  &gt;We need to put a stop to this whole trend now. Drunk driving should be legalized. And please don’t write me to say: ""I am offended by your insensitivity because my mother was killed by a drunk driver."" Any person responsible for killing someone else is guilty of manslaughter or murder and should be punished accordingly. But it is perverse to punish a murderer not because of his crime but because of some biological consideration, e.g. he has red hair.  &gt;Bank robbers may tend to wear masks, but the crime they commit has nothing to do with the mask. In the same way, drunk drivers cause accidents but so do sober drivers, and many drunk drivers cause no accidents at all. The law should focus on violations of person and property, not scientific oddities like blood content.  &gt;There’s a final point against Clinton’s drunk-driving bill. It is a violation of states rights. Not only is there is no warrant in the Constitution for the federal government to legislate blood-alcohol content – the 10th amendment should prevent it from doing so. The question of drunk driving should first be returned to the states, and then each state should liberate drunk drivers from the force of the law.  &gt;November 3, 2000  &gt;Llewellyn H.

If I was able to reply to lobido, it could have reminded him ""Oh hey, I forgot about /r/craigslist! I should post something there"".  Obviously not everyone is going to have this train of thought, but I am someone who does. I love little niche subreddits, but I'm terrible at keeping track of them, and so is reddit. I think I'm subscribed to too many subreddits because sometimes major ones such as /r/pics won't be listed in the bar at the top or show up on my frontpage. But that's another bug for another time. I think that the month cutoff will really stunt the ability of smaller subreddits to grow, and that there's a greater chance they'll become forgotten.

t5_2qj1c,authorblues,1298873481,"The problem with genetic algorithms is that they don't reliably find extrema. They breed a population set that is optimal in terms of genetic tolerance, not optimal in terms of the fitness function. The population will end up being that which is best suited to in-breeding valid solutions, not one that attempts to best solve the fitness function.  That being said, problems that are suited to the domain of GAs ""just work™"", whereas simulated annealing is less often an intuitive solution. The only thing that is necessary for a GA is that the solutions are able to be concisely expressed, and that the fitness function provides some sort of gradient toward the best solution.",™

t5_2qh1i,goout,1298880882,"Fair point and you're right of course. Ugh, I didn't want to get dragged down on discussing UAE itself, because I'm not the man to justify it. Of course these things are wrong. And could be avoided. Ultimately, what would it change to have decent conditions for these workers, it's some people earning $10M instead of $20M.  We agree on all this. What I'm trying to say is, take UAE 40 years ago. Enormous wealth, little development. Put a man in charge at the top. What is he going to do ? Plenty of examples in the area of what will probably happen, of presidents and kings becoming rich at the expense of their country and their people. Sheikh Zayed was the exception in that regard, he had the vision, the generosity and the willingness to do the right thing™. Everything is not rosy in the UAE, far from it, but I feel it came more of a lack of more people who shared those same values in the bureaucracy surrounding him than of a direct intention from Zayed to impose those conditions.  It's interesting that Paul Atreides was mentioned in the thread as well. I've heard an interview of Frank Herbert and David Lynch from 1983, that [you can find here](http://www.amazon.com/Dune-interview-Frank-Herbert-David/dp/0681308958/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1298880791&amp;sr=8-1). Part of it was Herbert talking about this very phenomenon. Right man at the top, wrong things happen as a consequence of the surrounding bureaucracy.  I wish I could develop further, I feel I've just scratched the surface but I've gotta leave for work now.",™
