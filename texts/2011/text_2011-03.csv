t5_2qh1i,jdrake90,1299005985,"I do. There is strong archeological evidence (as in thousands of cave and object paintings) of extremely anatomically correct creatures (resembling dinosaurs we have fossils of) interacting with people. While some of these might be a hoax, like the Icca stones, there are too many - spread across too many geographical areas - to conclude that people consistently imagine or make up artistic creatures that all look the same.  Also, history is full of dragon legends - the word Dinosaur wasn't used up until a couple hundred years ago - if you read descriptions of ""dragons"" that men have killed or attacked throughout history - you find descriptions of creatures that are very similar to dinosaurs we know existed. Again - probably a lot of myths amongst the historical accounts - but too many to discount. Marco Polo, for instance, reported seeing dragons pulling the king's carriage in China:  ""The book,The Travels of Marco Polo, is the written record which chronicles the adventures and travels that Marco Polo experienced while exploring the eastern world. In part 2, chapter 40, Marco Polo reports what he describes as ""huge serpents"". The descriptions given sound in many ways no different than descriptions given of the dinosaurs in the text books.  The following is an excerpt from Marco Polo's book in which he describes a dinosaur:  ""Leaving the city of Yachi, and traveling ten days in a westerly direction, you reach the province of Karazan, which is also the name of the chief city....Here are seen huge serpents, ten paces in length (about 30 feet), and ten spans (about 8 feet) girt of the body. At the fore part, near the head, they have two short legs, having three claws like those of a tiger, with eyes larger than a forepenny loaf (pane da quattro denari) and very glaring.""  The jaws are wide enough to swallow a man, the teeth are large and sharp, and their whole appearance is so formidable, that neither man, nor any kind of animal can approach them without terror. Others are met with of a smaller size, being eight, six, or 5 paces long; and the following method is used for taking them. In the day-time, by reason of great heat, they lurk in caverns, from whence, at night, they issue to seek their food, and whatever beast they meet with and can lay hold of, whether tiger, wolf, or any other, they devour;  ""After which they drag themselves towards some lake, spring of water, or river, in order to drink. By their motion in this way along the shore, and their vast weight, they make a deep impression, as if a heavy beam had been drawn along the sands. Those whose employment is to hunt them observe the track by which they are most frequently accustomed to go, and fix into the ground several pieces of wood, armed with sharp iron spikes, which they cover with sand in such a manner as not to be perceptible.  When therefore the animals make their way towards the places they usually haunt, they are wounded by these instruments, and speedily killed. The crows, as soon as they perceive them to be dead, set up to scream; and this serves as a signal to the hunters, who advance the spot, and proceed to separate the skin from the flesh, taking care immediately to secure the gall, which is most highly esteemed in medicine.  In cases of the bite of a mad dog, a penny weight of it, dissolved in wine, is administered. It is also useful in accelerating parturition, when the labor pains of women have come on. A small quantity of it being applied to carbuncles, pustules, or other eruptions on the body, they are presently dispersed; and it is efficacious in many other complaints.  The flesh also of the animal is sold at a dear rate, being thought to have a higher flavor than other kinds of meat, and by all persons it is esteemed a delicacy.""

When InGen learns of staff stranded on the island after the park’s collapse, they hire a group of mercenaries to launch a rescue operation. The team arrives amidst the chaos of dinosaurs running rampant, and begins to round up survivors committed to protecting the dinosaurs they created.

Along the way, a new mysterious nocturnal dinosaur threat emerges, stalking the group as they work their way across the island in hopes of escape.  ##Key features:## * An episodic adventure in five parts * Set during the events of the first film. * Story unfolds through a Steven Spielberg-inspired cinematic adventure crafted to stir mystery and tension while building to exciting climactic peaks. * Survive confrontations with T-Rex, Velociraptors and other dinosaurs.  ##System Requirements## * OS: XP Service Pack 3 / Vista / Windows 7 * Processor: 1.8 GHz Pentium 4 or equivalent * Memory: 2 GB RAM * Hard Disk Space: 2 GB Space Free * Video Card: ATI or NVidia card w/ 256 MB RAM * DirectX®: Direct X 9.0c * Sound: Direct X 8.1 sound device  *Jurassic Park is a trademark and copyright of Universal Studios and Amblin Entertainment, Inc.

The author seems to seriously misjudge the usefulness of a math and science-based education, and overestimates the necessity of an institutionalized postsecondary humanities education.   I tend to scoff at the humanities as a major choice because, unless you plan on *teaching* the subject yourself, spending thousands of dollars and 4 years of your life to read things you could just as easily read on your own time seems silly. If you choose a math or science-based university education, you get training and skills with wide applications while retaining the ability to read and learn whatever else you wish. The reverse is not usually true.   And I don't know where the author gets off thinking the ""problems in economics [and] ecology"" can be solved by someone without a quantitative background. This particular sentence shows a tremendous ignorance in the fields themselves and how a scientific education can be applied. And politics itself would probably get a boost if politicians had a working knowledge of statistics and data visualization, not to mention even a rudimentary understanding of science.   IMHO the root of everything he rails against is more the problems we have in our K-12 education. Our current system is churning out scientifically illiterate students who lack a basic curiosity for *anything*, including the various domains of the humanities, and whose only concern is making enough money to live ""the American Dream™"".

Then he went on his journey. 16 The man who had received five bags of gold went at once and put his money to work and gained five bags more. 17 So also, the one with two bags of gold gained two more. 18 But the man who had received one bag went off, dug a hole in the ground and hid his master’s money.     19 “After a long time the master of those servants returned and settled accounts with them. 20 The man who had received five bags of gold brought the other five. ‘Master,’ he said, ‘you entrusted me with five bags of gold. See, I have gained five more.’     21 “His master replied, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master’s happiness!’     22 “The man with two bags of gold also came. ‘Master,’ he said, ‘you entrusted me with two bags of gold; see, I have gained two more.’     23 “His master replied, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master’s happiness!’     24 “Then the man who had received one bag of gold came. ‘Master,’ he said, ‘I knew that you are a hard man, harvesting where you have not sown and gathering where you have not scattered seed. 25 So I was afraid and went out and hid your gold in the ground. See, here is what belongs to you.’     26 “His master replied, ‘You wicked, lazy servant! So you knew that I harvest where I have not sown and gather where I have not scattered seed? 27 Well then, you should have put my money on deposit with the bankers, so that when I returned I would have received it back with interest.     28 “‘So take the bag of gold from him and give it to the one who has ten bags. 29 For whoever has will be given more, and they will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what they have will be taken from them. 30 And throw that worthless servant outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’    ---   that being said, Christians tend to voluntarily donate more to the poor, they just don't like being forced to pay more without having say where it goes.   http://abcnews.go.com/2020/story?id=2682730&amp;page=1  ",©
t5_2qh1i,Networkian,1299162325,"150 comments, 11 hours. Dunno if anyone will see this but anyways... The first thing I thought of when I saw the title of this thread is what my friend posted a few weeks ago:  &gt; **I find that I often lack motivation. The trick here is not to try and find it, but to just get this dreadful stuff done.**  I realized that was true (for me at least). As a major procrastinator, I find it rather difficult to keep motivating myself. This quote basically summarizes my recent study efforts.  So to answer your question: when I'm not motivated, **I just knuckle down and do it.**  Edit: I do realize it's a bit simplistic and may not work for everyone. But IMO that's the heart of the matter. One just has to face the fact that there's study/work/whatever to be done and Just Do It™, even if there's no motivation or driven feeling at the given moment. Motivation is a great thing to have, but at other times, you just gotta just put your head down and plod onwards.  Edit 2: It's the wee hours of the a.m., so excuse my disjointed thoughts, haha. Don't get me wrong, I definitely try various things to get myself motivated. But when motivation fails, I remind myself that I have to do the work, fullstop.  Thanks for reading. *zZZZzZZZZzZZ*",™

t5_2qh1s,Fjordo,1299170268,"I agree if we wanted to keep the modality that we have today, it would continue to require a lot of energy (not necessarily oil), but our Way of Life™  is vastly inefficient. As energy becomes more expensive, these inefficiencies will disappear. This will suck from a standard of living perspective, but it will not represent a large crash.  I'll give one example: fresh produce. We ship a hell of a lot of it, and we ship it by truck and airplane because these are the only things that can logistically get it to market before it spoils. In a high energy cost environment, fresh produce will become a luxury for the rich. Instead canneries will be set up in the areas of food production and heavy rail will be used to move food. It will be canned, possibly high in salt, and not as nice as now, but it will be there, in the grocery store, ready for purchase.  This is just one aspect. Our economy is exceedingly complex and interwoven with energy intimately. Doomsayers keep taking the current energy usage and saying ""this is what we need"" taking it as an axiom that demand cannot shrink without massive starvation. This just isn't true.  But I have big concerns for urbanized areas. Cheap energy is what allowed people to leave rural parts for large cities. It all seems efficient until you understand the net energy. People in urban areas will, as always, rely on energy to be provided to them from non-urban areas.",™

t5_2qh1e,jeannaimard,1299202947,"&gt; You can complain that they were here first all you want, makes no difference. Until the complaints stop, nothing can move forward. Sure, they were here first, and maybe it's not fair we invaded their lands...but we did, and we're here, and we're not leaving. So they need to get over it.  Why would they need to get over it? Their civilization has been upheaved, and this solely thanks to the anglo-saxon imperialist attitude that cannot accept that other cultures are different and can co-exist with no problems.  Example: when the french started to cultivate the land, they had none of the constipated english attitude towards private property, so the farmer didn’t care the indians hunted on “his” land. Heck, more often than not, he’d join them on the hunt. This was a clear case of two intermingling civilizations because they had very few common points that could become conflictual. One hunted, and the other cultivated.  But when the english came, with their extremely anal views about private property (there is no specific word in french for “tresspassing”), they could not bear the idea of indians hunting on “THEIR” land (even though it had no effect on the productivity of the land), so they shoved them in reserves.  &gt; Sitting around crying about it with their hands held out, costing us millions in prison costs,   Well, it’s just too bad the english are too snotty to take a word from the french book… We grant the natives plenty of leeway to administer justice as they see fit, and the result is four times fewer aboriginals in jail.  &gt; addiction counseling and hand outs does nothing to endear them to the rest of us who have to work our asses off to pay for all of it.  If your civilization was against the wall, you would abuse substances too.  How about giving them a social environment where they could be themselves? But noooo. The anglo-saxon imperialistic view has to absolutely shove their way of life upon everyone.  &gt;  Again, this is at the risk of being too generalized, my best friend is aboriginal...  I have also plenty of niggers, asians and jews in my best friends… (Note for the sarcasm-impaired: this phrase is so full of sarcasm that it is dripping from your monitor).  &gt; Point being that there are a lot of aboriginals who have dignity and morals and ambition, and those I applaud.   Those, who have become white and are adhering to the strict anglo-saxon canons of the Holy Saint Personal Responsibility™???  &gt; But I, and I think many Canadians like me want aboriginals to start taking some responsibility for themselves.  It is only the anglo-saxons who worship personal responsibility so much. Other cultures don’t. Best proof: the no-fault car insurance in Québec. Sure, it lets all sorts of bad drivers escape from their own responsibility. But we have been viewing this as better as the alternative.  &gt; My point is simply this. It's been generations gone past, sure mistakes were made, but here we are. Time for aboriginals to pull up their socks and start making a difference in their own lives rather than drag the rest of down.  Translation: “enough bullshit, it’s time for the indians to become white so they can become members of the canadian mainstream society”.",™

Unless using LM has a direct impact on some particular user experience, I don't see Apple actually focusing on it.  Like a magician (or Steve's ""Reality Distortion Field™""), you focus on presenting the magic without the distraction of revealing all your tricks - the sale is more impressive and convincing that way.   Nerd types like the details but they are the minority market now - they are Early Adopters but personal computing devices are in Late Adoption now so they are not market changers/definers so much anymore.

The differences between these are as great, as subtle and as boring as the differences between LM vs Ti or Al or Mg in Macs.

t5_2qh33,shelanman,1299218269,"I won't doubt that some public workers work very hard and potentially suffer injury.  Actually, pensions are the primary cause of individual states' broken budgets.  They are not the cause of the overall economic crisis at all.  During the good times, government expenditures grew and government revenues grew.  Then, Bad Things™ happened, and revenues fell.  Government expenditures continued to grow -- at an enhanced pace, due to government attempts to limit the growth of the recession.  Government revenues are starting to rise again, but expenditures as a share of the overall economy have grown so much that, in total, they can not be afforded.  The best approach would probably be a small reduction in the pay of most government employees and a *massive* reduction in the *number* of government employees.  However, unions are completely unwilling to consider the latter, so states are pretty much forced to balance everything on the former.  My state has already raised taxes (personal income tax has increased to 9.55% (10.55% on $1 million/income, a 4% overall increase, sales tax has risen to anywhere from 8.75% to 10.25%, an average increase of about 15%), the state has borrowed huge sums of money, sold off most of its assets (hell, we collateralized the *lottery* so we could sell off the next 30 years of lottery revenue *now*), and it *still* isn't enough to pay for everybody that the state has hired.  We simply can't afford this much government.  We have no choice but to reduce its size.",™

t5_2qh03,Clbull,1299343411,"The PC gaming community can be compared to the Mac community in many different ways:  * They're paying out of their ass for decent hardware/performance. Compare the prices of gaming PCs and peripherals to the price of a new games console, and realise that you may need to replace your PC hardware just as if not more often in order to play upcoming titles on decent graphical settings at a decent framerate. And at the same times compare the prices and specifications of PC hardware and Mac hardware. * They have a cult following consisting of brain-less, militant fanboys. Heres a prime example of this. Look at how colossal mistakes (according to common sense) such as the iPad become success stories. Thats because the fanboys that consume the products do not care that the iPad is just an upscaled iPod Touch disguised as a tablet when in reality, it lacks the features that a proper tablet PC would have.  * They don't justify their arguments on why their choice is better. Much like this comment where everbeard calls every console gamer ""retarded"" and how most Mac vs PC commercials portray PC users as boring fat nerds who work in an office and do ""work things"" instead of ""fun things."" Thats not really a justification, that is just crapping nonsensical turds out of your mouth because the reality is..... Macs and PCs can do both 'work' and 'fun' stuff. * When they do justify their arguments, they come out with a load of bullshit. Take for instance the PC gamer argument that keyboard and mouse controls are superior to that of a gamepad. And the Mac fanboy argument that Macs are better because **'It just works™'** On those notes, Macs don't ""just work"", and while keyboard and mouse may be superior, it doesn't mean that the X360/PS3 are technologically incapable of supporting them.

t5_2qh68,jeannaimard,1299344974,"&gt; I don't mean this to be insulting in any way but I would really appreciate if you could detail the reasons why you would like Quebec to leave Canada. As a non-Quebecker I have to admit that I'm a little mystified about why such a strong separatist movements exists since my outsider's view doesn't reveal any situations that would necessitate such a drastic action like separation. I'd be really interested to hear what your motivations are.  You have to understand, first, how we are different. For we are different, very different. But this is only explained by History (prepare to be educated, because canadian history is so disgusting, it is not completely thaught in schools):  We are french, and as such, we have had a very different history, shaped by a very different geography.  France is the dead-end of ***ALL*** european invasions for the last 10,000 years. We are one of the mose mixed people on Earth. Why did all the invaders settled in France? Because it’s a very rich country with plenty of ressources.  Contrast this with Britain, whose poor ressources were depleted long ago, forcing the british to seek fortune overseas, hence their extensive empire.  By contrast, we did not need an empire; it wasn’t a question of survival; we had one just because it was fashionable.  In 1215, a weak king, Jean Sans-Terre (“John Lackland” — don’t forget that the british monarchy came from France) got conned into signing the magna carta, which paved the way for the anglo-saxon cultural mistrust of the State. During the industrial revolution, the bourgeois accumulated enough wealth to be able to subvert the whole political process.  By contrast, France always had a strong monarchy, that went unchallenged as the king consolidated his power. As France was a rich country, pretty much everyone was spared from the throngs of poverty who sent thousands of british overseas to seek fortune. As a result, the people was relatively contended with their lives as they had plenty to eat.  Of course, there was the french Revolution, which was the logical outcome of the centralization of the king’s power that got too far. As the french inherently trust the goverment, it takes a very long time to revolt against it when it goes too far, and the revolt, instead of suppressing the government, simply institutes stricter checks and balances to insure that the State does not become counterproductive.  Psychologically, since we trust the State, we see nothing wrong with working for it. So the brightest people have no problem working for the government, so it’s action is very competent: the largest high-speed rail network in the world is run by the french government, for example, and Québec’s government-owned Hydro-Québec provides the cheapest electricity on one of the very best power grids that is (the only northeastern grid that didn’t go down in 2003).  By contrast, anglo-saxons demonize and loathe the government. Everything is done to hinder it’s efficiency, and the power is detained by the wealthiest bourgeois who do not work for the public interest, but their own.  So, when we were abandonned by the king of France in 1763 and thrown in the clutches of the hereditary ennemy, the english. The government that was installed was a bourgeois government, by the bourgeois, for the bourgeois.  The incompetent merchants that came from Britain (because they were not successful in Britain) brought with them their incompetence.  I’ll give as an example John Molson (each time I see Concordia’s “John Molson school of economics” building, I want to puke at the testament to utter incompetence).  Most of the french settlers came from coastal regions, with the biggest chunk from Normandy. That‘s one of the few regions in France where grapes don’t grow. And, lo and behold!, grapes don’t grow (much) here either. But in both places apples thrive, and we cultivated apples, and we drank applejack cider.  Now, here comes John Molson who starts to make beer. Nobody drinks beer here, and why would we buy it when we make very good cider? So, of course, John Molson is just as unsuccessful here as he was in Britain, because his “beer” is a piss-poor product (always been, always will be).  So he went whining to the governor who promptly outlawed cider-making, so Molson could sell his donkey piss.  After the conquest, Canada (then Lower-Canada) was ruled by the incompetent family-compact, that horde of unsuccessful merchants and industrialists that poured from Britain.  James Murray, the very first british governor lamented that, thanks to the british anti-scatholic laws, he could not hire french people to help him administer because he was stuck with absolutely incompetent and stupid protestants who were not successful (for good reason!) in Britain.  For two centuries, we were at the mercy of english entrepreneurs and bourgeois who ran the show for their sole and only benefits, leaving us nothing but crumbs.  So, why did we not take over, because, at first, we were a majority?  Well, this is thanks to the scatholic church who teaches that “money is the devil’s dung” (actual quote from an actuall school book I actually had while in school). Since we were brainwashed to believe that businessmen go to hell, there were not very much french entrepreneurs. Even more so after the 1837 rebellion, which had decimated the french intelligienstia, leaving only the clergy who was against the rebellion.  As a reward, 30 years later, the scatholic church had the biggest plum you could imagine: the british north america act constitutionally enshrined it’s control over education in Québec, thus insuring that the upcoming generations would be brainwashed into not going into business, and therefore posing no economic threat to the incompetent family compact.  In 1840, the act of union basically accomplished one thing: to have lower-canada bail out upper-canada after being so blatantly mismanaged by the incompetent family compact (so you can see that the economic competence of the english is largely a myth). And they had to be bailed-out yet another time afterwards, at confederation!  Canada was founded as a business decision; the incompetent family compact running the show was clearly aware that it could not compete against the dynamic yankee industry, which was at the time being buoyed by the civil war, so they decided to form a “confederation” in order to shield their incompetence from the yankees. Initially, there was to be a referendum in Lower Canada (Québec) about joining the confederation. Even though at the time only rich landowning men could vote and the scatholic church threatened to excommunicate anyone who voted against (back then, voting was not by secret ballot; eligible electors signed a register), it was clear that the french were not interested in joining confederation, so Cartier and McDonald simply cancelled the referendum, substituting instead a vote in the Lower-Canada legislative assembly, a vote for confederation that was won by a single solitary vote of majority.  This is how we were dragged into a canada we did not want, and kept low by a foreign bourgeoisie that only sucked us dry.  It was only in the mid 1950’s that we stopped to blindly listen to the church, and a decade later, we were on the way of catching up centuries of History, ditching the scatholic church (that had done so much to fuck us up with the blessing of the english) in the garbage heap of History.  Having been raped and pillaged by english entrepreneurs, we wanted no more of this, and for that, we elected strong governments that would either take control of ressources (hydroelectric power) or enact very strong laws to protect us against the english exploiters. We have no problem with that, because, remember? we trust the government and the State.  And our government-owned corporations have nothing to be ashamed of; need I talk about Hydro-Québec, which runs circles around the utter incompetence of Ontario, who after such crappy management in Hydro-Ontario privatized it during the Nonsense Revolution™ only to have electric rates quadruple??? There is also the much-dreaded (in canada) Caîsse de Dépôt et de Placement, who offers extremely aggressive capital management to the point that, in the past, federal laws have had to be passed to shield canadian companies from being taken over by those disgusting frogs (I’m looking mostly at Canadian Pacific, the fer de lance of british imperialism in Canada and of scandalous government handouts and influence peddling).  We want out of Canada because we want out of the disgusting cesspool of bourgeois incompetence Canada is. It’s a filthy, disgusting, awful rotting mess of a country no one in his right mind should be proud of, it’s History having been nothing but rape and pillage (as british imperial history inevitably is).",™

I think its a fucking pisstake when people like Liu Xiaobo, Lech Walesa, Aung San Suu Kyi and the Dalai Lama have to do much, much, much more in order to earn the same reward. Obama so far has been disappointing, but that may be because he has faced so much opposition to his proposed changes, even when the mid-term elections didn't lead to Republican House dominance. Having said this, didn't the democrats win quite significantly in the US elections?

And what about TIME Person of the Year. Clearly the editors who actually decide who gets the award are ass-kissing idiots...  I mean what the fuck has Mark Zuckerberg done to earn that award? Built and subsequently ran a social network into the depths of hell with intrusive privacy defying updates, terrible layout redesigns and the introduction of the Application platform, an invention so terrible that it has turned every profile from a wall of posts into a clusterfuck of terrible apps such as ""What Kama Sutra position are you?"" quizzes where you have to spam the fucking app to 30 friends to find out your answer.  Hell.... dare I say it, even Justin Bieber deserved that award more than he did. Facebook may be the dominant social network now but thats only because MySpace was a steaming turd.  And what about George W. Bush. Only Person of the Year because:  A) He was US President  B) He started an illegal war in Iraq.  Point A goes for every US president who has pretty much appeared as Person of the Year at least once.  The US soldiers did a lot more to earn their spot, risking their lives to fight in both Afghanistan and Iraq.

t5_2qh1i,aazav,1299386593,"The recounting of my life in a haunted house on Wing Lake Rd. in Birmingham/Bloomfield Michigan. © 1999  Part 1 of 2.  The address is on Wing Lake Rd in Birmingham/Bloomfield Township, Mich.  First or second house on the right when entering Wing Lake Rd from the south.  With a gravel driveway, the house was painted yellow when I lived there in 1982.  At that time, I was a sophomore in HS, about 14 or 15, didn't drink, do drugs and was a normal 15 year old kid.  The first night my family lived in the house, all the lights went out in the house except in the garage below the small attic and the attic.  The door to the small attic would slowly open with a creak and then within a minute, slam shut.  Often, when in the house and after standing still, I would get a feeling like someone cold was walking up behind me and putting their hand right over my shoulder.  Quickly turning around would make the feeling go away then it would settle in again.  Like someone was right behind you and you turn around and they are not there.  When eating dinner, the sound of someone bouncing a ball would be heard over our heads.  Like when you drop a ping pong ball and it quickly speeds up its bouncing but this would go over several minutes.  Twice when entering the garage, a large rusty 3 inch nail fell out of a nailless, stucco ceiling, leveled out and zipped in front of me, hitting the garage divider, bouncing off a box and hit the floor with a ping.  Then it disappeared.  This happened to me twice and to my father once, but he was able to pick up the nail. The amazing thing was that the nail took exactly the same path both times it happened to me.  There was no hole in the ceiling left by the nail either.  A pattern was developing that only these things would happen to men, not women.  I never figured out why until after I had moved out of the house.  We had a yard man who lived in Wayne or Pontiac, Mich and was recently unemployed from one of the car companies.  Curious, I asked him if he noticed anything funny happening to him in the house.  He denied any odd happenings until he was painting the room to the small attic and the radio station changed on him while he was listening to it.  After this experience, he informed my mother that when we had any house work he'd call us, and not to call him.  After a while he calmed down but was pretty shook up.  Twice while sleeping, odd things happened in my room.  The first was reminiscent of the old Pepto Bismol commercials where the man in the commercial would bulge and wobble due to his discomfort.  One night, I woke up in the middle of the night and saw my closet doors doing this.  Realizing that there was nothing I could do to change it, I closed my eyes and went back to sleep.  That to me, is a very strange reaction and after we left the house, we wondered if we were insane to live there for a year.  The second incident was a simple ""there is someone walking in my room"".  I could hear footsteps and boards creaking as if someone was entering my room.  There were no depressions in the carpet and only 3 audible steps were taken into my room.  Again, I just went back to sleep.  While playing on the lake ice with my friend Quigley and his dog, we decided to play at my house.  I warned him that it was haunted but we'd make the best of it.  When we approached the house, it took some effort to get the dog into the front yard but a taunting with a tennis ball eventually got the critter onto the grass.  Finally able to grab the dog, we took him off the grass and onto the front porch where he fought against us strongly.  From there, Kevin took the dog by the collar and I opened the front door.  His dog froze, looked up the staircase inside, whimpered, backed off the foundation taking us with him and almost dragged us off the lawn.  We couldn't hold on and the dog just stayed in the street, never coming close to the house or the lawn.  Baffled and not seeing any spectres, Kevin and I entered the house and got cookies.  After the cookie break, we went upstairs and as adolescents started wrestling and beating each other up.  While wrestling about the room, we fell on my solid pine bed and the bed snapped in half.  Now, I had that bed for 12 years and it had taken a beating but it could have just broken.  Kind of embarrassed, we both went downstairs and Kevin left with his dog.  I had another friend named Justin who had a beer can collection like I did.  I kept mine in the small attic and therefore did not go there much.  Knowing that if I invited Justin over, the ghost would pay more attention to someone new, I told him about the haunted house and we went over to check out my beer can collection.  Justin reacted rather well for the first ten minutes except that I didn't have ten minutes of beer cans to see.  He often got a surprised look on his face and tried to brush something off his shoulder.  Three times I asked him if he wanted to leave until he strongly told me that he would tell me when he wanted to go.  He just walked back and forth between the same racks looking at the same cans.  3  minutes later, he asked to leave.  Going down the stairs, I asked him if he felt the ghost touching his back.  Abruptly, he turned to me and without answering my question, told me never, EVER to take him back to that room again.  Years later, I described to him exactly what happened to him (that feeling from paragraph 3) and he was amazed that I was exactly right. ""Like you're walking down a deserted road with no one for thousands of miles and you know there is someone right behind you.""  Nonchalantly, I told him that I lived there for a year and was well accustomed to the feelings of that house.  When we moved to the house, we had a cat.  The cat would normally be a ""house cat"" and stay around the house with a few late night jaunts.  The critter's behavior changed and it rarely spent time around the house and finally left.  Don't really know why but animals did not seem to like this house.  The problems of living in that house were not shared with our neighbors.  Surprisingly, a neighbor from 3 houses up the block would ask me how I was doing and how things were going whenever he would see me.  Only later, I would realize that he was asking me ""are you doing ok in that haunted house?""  Once, my father and I entered the room next to the room that went to the small attic and felt a presence.  We decided to lighten up the atmosphere and started paying attention to the ghost and actively speaking about being nice to the ghost and maybe ""take a ghost to lunch.""  1/2 hour after we started, without a word, we stopped.  An ominous hostile nature hinting ""stop NOW"" was the general feeling that came about the room.  During that time, the feeling on my back could be shrugged or whisked away with a brush of my hand.  1/2 hour later, we both got up and left.  I asked my father who was a former secret agent and not a wimp, ""let's never do that again.""  He quickly agreed.  Coincidentally, at the time that we lived in the house was when Poltergeist was released to theatres.  I definitely went to see that movie.  After a while, it was obvious to the family that I was having trouble living in the house.  Once I asked my dad if anything happened to him that he hadn't told me about.  He recounted a story of a few weeks earlier where he was sitting on the porcelain throne and the wastepaper basket flew across the room without his permission.  My definition of an area influenced by a poltergeist is if inanimate objects fly around the room without you asking them to.  Continued... ",©

t5_2qhos,dagbrown,1299420078,"The main problem with GZip: The Human Language™ is that it completely fails the ""huh?"" test.  Let's say a motorcycle rider is revving their bike nearby.  Someone says something in Ithkuil near you, and half of it is obscured by BRUMM BRUMM BRUMM BRUMM.  If the speaker was speaking English, odds are enough of the meaning would survive to make it to your ears, and the bits that you missed you could probably fill in.  If the bits that were missing were an infix, a particle and a tone, and that made the difference between ""the horse I sold to the old merchant"" and ""my grandmother who needs to buy a new wooden leg"", the language is too information-dense to be practical for use by normal humans in normal situations.  Which is why most languages have seemingly way more phonemes than is really necessary--because people need to communicate in noisy circumstances, and it's better to throw in enough information that you can reconstruct what was originally said, without saying ""What?!"" eight times.  Also related--when there are tonal languages that have whistling variants (for long-distance communication across jungles, for example), the whistling phrases are always long-winded so as to include enough information for the listener to be able to reconstruct what was said without mistake.",™

t5_2qzb6,kelly961,1299477513,"Religions has some type of ritual in which this distracts from Gods main goal. Salvation...and i don't refer to myself as a christian being that people distorted the concept. I am a child of God. Christ died a horrible death for you and me and God allowed it to happen. That's the last sacrifice thus ritual...  The PROOF is in you if you want it....Romans:10,9. If you accept Christ in your heart and you humbly honestly mean it and ask for forgiveness of your sins and confess with your mouth that Christ was raised from the dead you are not only saved. ..You receive the Holy Spirit in you on immediate confession. If  you do this and ask the Holy Spirit to guide you, and stay in His word (get spiritually feeding, Ask for guidance in reading the bible)- it can be as little as you want..(baby steps God says).. you will experience change in you and you will feel the difference in your new life as appose to old. God says."" you are a new creation. The old you is gone.)"" You will feel a change as long as you don't let anything hinder it. (obstacles-people) The Holy Spirit ((John 14:16 .....(New International Version, ©2011) 16) And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another advocate to help you and be with you forever)—   (((What does the Holy Spirit do in our lives? He . . . Teaches believers and reminds us of what we have learned (John 14:26). He brings to mind verses and scriptural truth we have forgotten.  Convicts the world (the saved..Child of God...born again)of sin, righteousness, and judgment (John 16:8-11).  Testifies about Jesus, rather than Himself (John 15:26). He reveals our need for Christ and shows us how to depend on the Lord.  Guides us into all truth (John 16:13).  Dwells within every believer (Rom. 8:11). He lives within us the moment of salvation.  Guides our steps and helps us discover the Father’s plans for us (Rom. 8:14).  Assures us that we are saved. He “testifies with our spirit that we are children of God” (Rom. 8:16) ( Charles Stanley www.intouch.org)))Saturday eastern time 8:00pm  The Holy Spirit Helps interpret the bible...  Helps us know the real sent teachers of the world and the false deceiving -after money teachers..""We will know them by their fruits.""  ..You will experience all this and be sure of it inside you..you'll know it by feeling;  If you choose not to because of the angers of the world or your not happy with your life or angry for or about certain issues in or of the world, that's your choice. God gave us free will. Sorry I took so long..just noticed and i'm using on screen keyboard...The terrible thing about writing to people you dont know is that people cant hear your voice. because of this, it distorts manners in which we speak. .. You feel it because if we didn't feel it, no one on this planet would be sure and missionaries wouldn''t be uprooting their lives, going to other countries and putting their selves and families in danger if they didn't feel God strongly within. Their are people who say they are Christian's and don't no what it means to be one. Your not and you now do. Which is following the examples of Christ.  Why are people so threatened by Jesus teaching to love your neighbor, how to be a better person,be kind, helps you to be calm in situations, how to handle tuff situations, gives inner peace and promises to be there by your side at every moment. IF so called christian's are disgruntled , then they didn't trust Him with their life...Some people think if they are not in control, then they will have a boring life.which questions their salvation....on the contrary, it gets more exiting. God is a rewarder...not sayin yu wont have tuff times, but  He will make the load lighter on your shoulders.. Gods exact law is to be obedient and that we are to be examples of Jesus,  to be gentle disciples and help lead people to Salvation. The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness;(slow) but is longsuffering ( patient) toward us, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance. He wants us to have eternal life and enjoy a good life here on earth...If we are not happy, we are less likely to spread His word...(AKJV)Matthew 6:34..Take therefore no thought for the morrow:( don't worry) about for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient to the day is the evil thereof...(Jesus could come back tomorrow) Revelations.....Well that's it. Your choice...I could go on and on..with great things....Im afraid of angering  you even more..wasnt my intention..I really care for your life and have undoubted belief or i wouldn't have responded. wishing you the best.",©

Even the dogs came and licked his sores.    22 “The time came when the beggar died and the angels carried him to Abraham’s side. The rich man also died and was buried. 23 In Hades, where he was in torment, he looked up and saw Abraham far away, with Lazarus by his side. 24 So he called to him, ‘Father Abraham, have pity on me and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, because I am in agony in this fire.’    25 “But Abraham replied, ‘Son, remember that in your lifetime you received your good things, while Lazarus received bad things, but now he is comforted here and you are in agony. 26 And besides all this, between us and you a great chasm has been set in place, so that those who want to go from here to you cannot, nor can anyone cross over from there to us.’    27 “He answered, ‘Then I beg you, father, send Lazarus to my family, 28 for I have five brothers. Let him warn them, so that they will not also come to this place of torment.’    29 “Abraham replied, ‘They have Moses and the Prophets; let them listen to them.’    30 “‘No, father Abraham,’ he said, ‘but if someone from the dead goes to them, they will repent.’    31 “He said to him, ‘If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets, they will not be convinced even if someone rises from the dead.’”    The rich man asked that his brothers be warned of the torment.

t5_2qh5b,Lors_Soren,1299551169,"&gt; Could you give some examples of propositions that have moral value and the different moral values they have? For example, I can say ""Obama is currently the president"" has truth-value True, while ""Obama was born in Kenya"" has truth-value False.  Not really because I don't have an ethical theory to put forward. Within the context of some ethical theory if you had a 2-valued algebra the theory would state like ""Janey had premarital sex"" has a value of immoral and ""Amy saved an innocent man's life"" has a value of moral.  Maybe I also want to use a set containing the words ""should"" or ""must"" or ""thou shalt not"" as the image the words maps onto.  Ethicists can go many different directions with this, it's just using the same symbology but instead of {T,F} or {T,F,I} or [0,1] or {T,F,B,N} -- whichever logic system -- there's an isomorphism from {T,F} to {moral, immoral} or whatev.  Sorry if I'm still being unclear. I just don't think or read often about ethical philosophy.  Then there is another, totally different, application of modal logic, which is to express ◻x = ""it's obligatory that x"" and ◇x = ""it's permitted that x"".  &gt; ... similar ... lesswrong  Indeed, we have been indoctrinated by the same overmasters. I especially liked the post ""Bayesian Judo"" but I try not to read too often, so I don't go there much anymore.  &gt; ctrl+f  http://www.stats.uwaterloo.ca/~cgsmall/ontology.html + Ctrl-F = ""contingent"". There are four modal cases there: necessary falsehood, contingent falsehood, contingent truth, necessary truth.  &gt; sociopath  Zing!  &gt; impractical  Yup, after all this is philosophy.  &gt; bizarre ... how the USA got [its views]  Sounds like it's time for a self post.  &gt; utility ... good  Back to that. Utility is an individual-level concept. Good feels like a macro concept especially in the God context, although it can be applied on a smaller scale. You can say ""That was a good thing you did there"" -- the good act feels somehow an element of the set of good acts.  So it seems natural to me to define good via a map from individual utilities to {good, ..., ..., ...}. This gets around the problem of objective reality and can even stand up to the non-existence of 1-D utility. However this approach fails because Good has to do with intentions as well as outcomes. Sigh.  On a personal note. I think the reason I'm so out of my depth and being unclear here is that I don't personally believe in good or 1-D utility as such, so I'm always reasoning at arm's length ... ""well, if good *were* to exist, what could it possibly be like? how could we logically design something that might fit the shape of what people seem to mean by the word 'good' ?"" Same goes for Pareto comparisons, I make moral choices entirely from the gut and don't try to philosophize them so the ethical theory for me is entirely theoretical.",◻

t5_2qh1i,jeannaimard,1299561311,"&gt; Americans are not the worst people in the world. It is ridiculous that Americans are incarcerated at a much higher rate than any other nationality.  Well, yes, real, good americans are not the worst people in the world. It’s all those beaners, niggers, tokers and perverts who are locked-up.  &gt; We need to drastically reduce the number of people being incarcerated, by reducing the number of crimes involving imprisonment. At the very minimum, a crime possibly involving imprisonment must always have one or more real human victims who suffered as a result of the accused's actions. (No prison at all for ""victimless crimes"".)  Crimes are made by people without any morals, so it is necessary for the well-being of society to lock-up morally-deficient people.  &gt; As part of hopefully ""fixing"" the problems raised by Citizens United, no corporation involved in the private-prison industry is allowed to lobby, advertise, or contribute toward any legislation regarding criminal laws.  A private prison is a very good means for the taxpayers to have excellent value for their tax dollars.  &gt; Resolution of property crimes should focus primarily on restoring the property (or value of the property) plus extra for interest, inconvenience, emotional attachment, legal costs, etc. If someone convicted of a property crime is financially unable to pay ReimbursementPlus, the government will reimburse the victim and then either take the money from the convict's future earnings or assign sufficient community service to handle the debt to society.  With such a system, the Saint-Holy Personal-Responsibility™ that is worshipped in Amerika goes flying right out of the window. You do not want the Evil, Bad State™ to take the role of a formative experience for all those criminal with dubious moral character. What has to be done is to effectively punish criminals so they can improve their morality.  &gt; Intent does matter. It can be difficult to establish intent, but generally speaking accidents should be distinguished from crimes for personal profit. Stealing a loaf of bread should be distinguished from stealing a watch.  It is the same thing. It deprives someone of his Holy-Saint Private-Property™ acquired through hard labour, and there is nothing more morally uplifting than working hard for his very own personal property, so theft shall be punished with the utmost regard to enforce the highest moral standards.  &gt; Eliminate all versions of ""Three-Strikes-and-Out"" laws. Restitution and punishment should escalate for repeated offenses, but thresholds where a petty crime results in a life sentence are insane.  Repeated offences are the hallmark of morally bankrupt characters which we do not want roaming our streets.  &gt; We should try for non-prison sentencing for non-violent crime whenever feasible. If the convict will not comply with the terms of sentence, then punitive incarceration should be considered.  Sentencing should be the harshest possible punishment, left you drive the message that it is okay to be morally deficient.  &gt; Finally--and for me, most importantly--violent criminals and non-violent criminals are never to be housed together.  Violence by unrepentent morally bankrupt criminals is a part of the punishment for being morally deficient.  It is all about punishment and revenge; this is why americans are so prompt to jail.",™

t5_2qh1i,bdfortin,1299728285,"Funny story from a few hours ago:  I work at a NorthernTel Mobility (A Division Of Bell Aliant™) dealer. We had a customer come in today looking to switch over from Rogers because he gets a special teacher rate plan with NTM/Bell, and because he doesn't get reception with Rogers in his new house. Not only was he looking to switch, but since we just launched HSPA ho could bring over his phone, too, provided Rogers was willing to unlock it for him.  Easy enough, I know from experience that all he has to do is make sure he still has an account (so they can charge him the outrageous unlocking fee), and since he wanted to port his number over I knew he'd have to get it unlocked before we finished the port.  So, while he's in the store he calls customer service to get his phone unlocked, and they say since he's moving outside their coverage area they'll waive the early termination fee. All he has to do is finish the port and they'll gladly unlock the phone for him, as well as put through the cancellation request.  Kind of weird, I thought, and he questioned it while he was still on the phone with them, but they assured him that's how it worked. So we carried on with the port, got the number over, and finished signing the paperwork.  Once we were done he called customer service back to unlock his phone. ""Oh, we're sorry, you need an active account to do that. You'll have to go to your nearest Rogers dealer to open an account so we can unlock it for you. And since we noticed you're cancelling while you still have a contract, you'll be looking at an early termination fee on your last bill.

The car, 'grown from the soil,' had hemp plastic panels whose impact strength was 10 times stronger than steel; Popular Mechanics, 1941.    http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&amp;aid=872   And   &gt;The only steel in the hand-made body is found in the tubular welded frame on which are mounted 14 plastic panels, 3/16 inch thick. Composed of a mixture of farm crops and synthetic chemicals, the plastic is reported to withstand a blow 10 times as great as steel without denting. Even the windows and windshield are of plastic. The total weight of the plastic car is about 2,000 pounds, compared with 3,000 pounds for a steel automobile of the same size.

It's just like the pill and how women who are on it for a long time and then want to get pregnant normally have to wait a while after stopping the pill to be able to conceive. It's all about residuals.  Also, been on it 3 years, fuck all the time and don't use a condom [I'm in a completely monogamous relationship]. I'm not really advocating that this is for everyone, but it sure has worked for me. And my doctor did say it was perfectly fine.   edit: From NuvaRing's website:  *If NuvaRing® is out for less than 3 hours: Rinse NuvaRing® with cool-to-lukewarm (not hot) water and reinsert it as soon as possible, at the latest within 3 hours. You should still be protected from pregnancy.

I'm not trying to tell you what to do, I'm just pointing out that Nuvaring does not endorse taking the ring out for sex, and I personally wouldn't choose to take the risk since I don't have access to the relevant mathematical models that would tell me just how big a risk it is.

t5_2qh1i,yawgmoth,1299971066,"First thing that came to my mind. $3500 for a touchscreen, winCE and some pictorial software?   And that form factor is so huge.... why does it need to be that big? Just get an iPad or a Xoom and make the software yourself.  Then I saw this: &gt;Medicare classifies the ALT-Chat™ DPlus as a Speech Generating Device (SGD) and covers it as durable medical equipment within Part B benefits. The ALT-Chat™ D+ fits into the Medicare HCPC coding of E2510. This HCPC coding system is used to determine the allowable reimbursement by Medicare. Reimbursement rates are typically updated quarterly and can be found on the Medicare web site or by contacting Saltillo Corporation.  THAT's where the price is coming in. Now I have no idea what it takes to get that kind of thing certified, but I know people that work in the medical  and aeronautical device industries and they say that most of the cost of *any* device is not in the actual design of the hardware or software, but in all of the layers of bureaucracy needed to get it approved and certified. (which isn't necessarily a bad thing... you don't want your plane going down or your surgical equipment crashing because a coder forgot to implement some standard, or the device wasn't tested properly)  It would take more research to figure out exactly what you have to do to get an iPad or android tablet certified in the same way as this device and then you could do a proper cost analysis. This device has very little potential for injury if it fails, so the restrictions are probably pretty lax, and are more along the lines of 'does this actually help non-communicating people?'.",™

t5_2scnv,theinternetftw,1299972715,"Alright.  A data flip-flop (DFF) is one of the smallest building blocks of Clocked Memory, memory that changes state only when the clock changes.  The Level-Triggered D Flip Flop will output whatever you're inputting to it when the clock is off, but when the clock is on, it locks on to the last value you put in, and ignores anything you do to the input until the clock goes back off again.  The Edge-Triggered DFF is more precise, because it pays attention to the input value ONLY at the exact moment the clock changes.    There are actually two types of edge triggered flip flops, because you can either pay attention to right when the clock goes off, or right when it comes on.  The wiki talks about that last type.  --------------------------------  Ok, so that's what a DFF is, but here's what it \*isn't\*:   A DFF \*isn't\* exactly a bit of memory yet.  To really be a bit of memory, you need kind of a ""wrapper"" around the DFF to make it easy to use, and to make it hold a value past the next clock cycle. Without that, every clock cycle it's always checking the input for the next bit to hold on to.   That wrapper basically feeds the output of the DFF back into itself until it's told to load something new.  That's when you have real memory, with an input, an output, a clock, and a ""load"" switch.  ------------------------------------  One last thing: a specific reason why Edge triggered DFFs are valuable.    When I was making Registers for the CPU, since those are just small 16bit chunks of memory, I was using DFFs.   I wanted to use regular DFFs because they're about half as big as edge-triggered, but I ended up using edge-triggered because of a big problem:  For the CPU I let registers feed back into themselves (example, Register D = Register D + 2).  With regular flip flops, when the clock signal goes down, the DFF just keeps changing. That means D would just keep adding 2 to itself over and over and over again while the clock was off and the load bit was set.    With Edge Triggered, there's not that problem, because the DFF only looks at input one brief instant per cycle, instead of there being a period of time where it can change over and over again.  There, hope that helps.  I'm kind of inspired now, actually.  I might make a small world with some  demonstrations of what I'm talking about.  -------------------------------------  **EDIT**: Sorry for the Wall Of Text™, but there's one more thing: If you look on the wiki (in the [d flip flop table](http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Redstone\_circuits#D\_Flip-Flop)) it'll say that an edge triggered flip flop isn't that much bigger than a regular one. That's because whoever designed the ""B"" DFF is cheating: using something called an edge detection circuit to create a ""fake"" edge triggered DFF with far fewer parts.  I tried using that design but it was... unruly.  It'd flicker and be inconsistent.",™

t5_2r5vt,Zeratul,1300060311,"I've had this idea for a while and I'm kind of surprised no porn company has tried it: personally-customized videos. So before downloading, or maybe in your registration with the site, you check your preferences, like:  * ☑ Show the blowjob scene * ☐ Show the pussy-eating scene * ☐ Show actress angrily spitting on his cock * ☐ Show actor angrily spitting on her pussy * ☐ Show the guy's face right before he cums * ☐ Show the guy's face ever * ☐ Show the shot-from-low saggy-ballsack-swinging man-ass scene * ☑ Show the facial * ...etc.  So the software would re-cut the video based on your preferences.  And while we're customizing porn, I'm pretty sure it would be technologically feasible, and not particularly expensive, to be able to choose the girl's hair color. You'd just have to have the actress dye her hair some weird color that otherwise won't be used in the scene, like bright green, and then have your software replace any green pixels with the chosen color, whether it's blonde or black or purple or whatever. **Edit:** Or even changing color, shifting smoothly from one to another. That could be a porn movie's gimmick, that there's a girl whose hair changes color depending on her arousal. Sure, that's a weird and not-inherently-hot gimmick, but in porn, novelty sells.  Come to think of it, you could probably choose eye color too if she wore those really brightly colored contact lenses.  (Not that I personally care all that much about hair and eye color, but some people do. Basically I just think the technology is interesting and feasible, and the porn company would get free press from it and it would generate curiosity.)",☑

t5_2qh1i,J-Rad,1300066045,"The thing with both of these franchises is that they had strayed (in many people's opinions) far enough from their roots that some fresh blood was needed to reinvigorate interest in them.  Take the Bond franchise for example: 2002's *Die Another Day* is rated at [59% on RT](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/die_another_day/), which seems a bit high in my opinion (lifelong Bond fan here); *Casino Royale* is [rated at 94%](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/casino_royale/).  Critics aside, what made the Bond films so appealing in the first place?  Charisma.  Sean Connery's pushing 80 and women are STILL crazy for him.  Roger Moore had the same pull (for awhile at least) to rank him as a top Bond in many books.  Pierce Brosnan brought that very appeal to *GoldenEye*, which was faithful in following the established Bond formula (gadgets, Q, Miss Moneypenny, etc.), and was, in my opinion, a breath of fresh air.    But even Brosnan's charm only went so far -- the wit was disappearing from these scripts and the dialogue was getting just plain awful.  It was time to reevaluate the approach.  Fleming's first Bond book, *Casino Royale*, was the place to start.  When describing *Royale's* Bond, words like ""raw"" and ""intense"" are often used.  This is not the Bond we're used to seeing.  That Bond, the Sean Connery/Roger Moore, was born through the events of *Casino Royale*.  He let his guard down briefly in *On Her Majesty's Secret Service*, but after that it was business as normal: Q, gadgets, Moneypenny.  So while Craig makes a very good raw bond (especially in body type), the question remains: can he be the witty, charming, womanizing, stoic Bond that we're used to?  I don't know yet.  *Quantum of Solace* was a steaming pile, and [it'll be awhile before we see Bond 23](http://filmpopper.com/the-next-james-bond-movie-is-now-on-indefinite-hiatus/) (though it's rumored to be in pre-production).  Just so long as Bond doesn't get sabotaged by another terrible script I think Craig will do him justice.  As for Batman, I'm glad it graduated from campy to serious.  True, the movie franchise inherited its silliness from the Adam West series, but the story has been far more dark and complicated than [Bat Nipples](http://i.imgur.com/qprq1.jpg) or the [Bat Card™](http://i.imgur.com/74vP4.jpg).",™

View our Clevo Models here.   So basically, yes, they make more than you imagine. If you buy from one of the many resellers like XoticPC, Malibal, Mythlogic, LPC-Digital, PowerNotebooks, etc, you get better warranties than through Sagernotebook.com themselves. (and much better customer support). They're well known in owner's circles for great build quality and the user upgradeability of parts. Check out the [Sager-Clevo forums on NBR](http://forum.notebookreview.com/sager-clevo/) if you want to read up on them or ask questions. It's where I went to learn about them.   Feel free to look up the resellers and go ask them questions directly. I did live chat with Malibal and XoticPC before I bought mine, and they were always awesome. The stock warranty is 3 year labor / 1 year parts with free shipping both ways for the first year at most resellers. You can always bump this warranty up, but for most people they don't have any real technical issues until 4-5 years after purchase based on what I see in the forums.  ",®

t5_2s4an,Tylerdurdon,1300206876,"Just what I was going to say...Nothing wrong with modifying the hosts file, but be aware that it will ALWAYS take the hosts file as the final word when it comes to resolving a name (IE, converting a name like www.blehbleh.com to an IP like 23.34.56.78). (and yes, this is assuming the client's DNS cache is cleared)  On a sidenote, it's fun to mess with your friends by looking up a bad site's IP address and replacing a normal entry with it's IP (like finding out that smut.com is at 44.33.22.11 and putting an entry to www.myspace.com in your hosts file pointing to that address).    Also though, it's used to control surfing in a company.  Combining hosts file redirection (IE I don't want people surfing to myspace.com so I'll redirect to 127.0.0.1) with a web-filter saves you local bandwidth because the requests don't ever leave the users' machines.

Particularly (as in the case of nuclear), the failures can be spectacularly catastrophic. But also from an anti-terrorism point of view (if you're into that sort of thing).  And also from an economic point of view as well - If small groups of people (e.g., towns, communities) can own wind turbines, or solar farms, they can all generate an income. That's awesome!

As for it breaking down:   SunChips® tested the compostability of the bag under multiple conditions, aerobic, anaerobic and adiabatic conditions. The results have provided insight into the best conditions for composting this new packaging material. They found that under aerobic compost conditions at &gt;55˚C the film structure breaks down very quickly, in about 12-16 weeks. They also found that under anaerobic conditions (similar to what would be found in a landfill) no significant decomposition takes place. This means that the new film would not decompose in a properly maintained landfill.  [Source](http://www.novativemedia.com/green-news/sun-chips.php)",®

t5_2qh2p,dekesler,1300373377,"Here is the comment that I left. Let us see if it gets approved.  Eschatology is mental masturbation. It helps pass the time in an enjoyable way, but it really does not accomplish anything. No ones life has ever been improved by listening to someone else’s claim that the end is neigh.  Regardless, let’s take a look at your claim that Japan is the dragon from John of Patmos’ Book of Revelation.   International Standard Version (©2008) “Then the dragon stood on the sand of the seashore. I saw a beast coming out of the sea. It had ten horns, seven heads, and ten royal crowns on its horns. On its heads were blasphemous names.”  First off, there is no dragon in earlier translations. Consider the same passage from the King James Bible.  King James Bible “And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy.”  One could argue that John of Patmos, not to be confused with the Apostle John, is the Dragon. However, that would mean that the mistranslation was all part of some inscrutable divine plan. But I digress.  You contend that the dragon is not literal. That is a huge leap. You are not the first to make this leap. Futurist interpretations of Revelation were first introduced in the 16th century by Francisco Ribera. Prior to this, the Revelation was viewed as an account of prophecies being fulfilled throughout history. The earliest complete commentary on the book of Revelation was carried out by Victorinus in 300 AD, considered to be one of the earliest Historicist commentators. But, again, I digress.   Let’s look at your claim that Japan is the Dragon. First off, Japan is not known as the land of the dragon. Japan is more commonly known as the land of the rising sun. The sun is featured on Japan’s flag. I’ll concede that dragons are a common feature of Japanese mythology; however, this legend of the Japanese dragon has its origins in Chinese myths and folklore. Let’s consider China.  China has been known as the land of the dragon. It has had a long association with creatures that westerners have called dragons; however, in China “Loongs” are considered beneficial and magical creatures. They are very different from western dragons. To find a land that is identified with our western understanding of dragons, we should go westward.  The Welsh Dragon appears on the national flag of Wales. The oldest recorded use of the dragon to symbolize Wales is from the Historia Brittonum, written around 820, but it is popularly supposed to have been the battle standard of King Arthur and other ancient Celtic leaders. However, is this dragon from Revelation even a land mass?  From the text it seems clear that the Dragon is standing upon the sand of the sea. This is suggestive of a city or a structure or a person and not a country or land. After all, land standing upon the land is nonsense. The City of London has as her symbol the Dragon.  So, the Dragon of Revelation is John of Patmos, Japan, China, Wales or the City of London. If we squint our eyes a little, the dragon could be King Arthur.  Let’s try this interpretation on for size. King Arthur is the dragon that stood upon the sands near the sea. There he confronted the great beast with seven heads and ten horns. Rome has seven hills and ten provinces.   In conclusion, attempting to find symbolic or futurist meanings in the writings of someone from the Iron Age is pointless. If there is a god and he wanted us to know the future, then he would have simply provided it to us in a manner that was plain and clear and consistent. Even your own holy book makes it clear that this endeavor is pointless.  Matthew 24:36-37  36 “But about that day or hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father. 37 As it was in the days of Noah, so it will be at the coming of the Son of Man.  Sadly, there is no geological evidence to support the story of a global flood. But I digress. ",©

Put it on a tray and roast it slooooowly at 80°C / 175°F, until the thermometer reads 55°C / 130°F.  Take the roast out of the oven and let it rest for at least 15 minutes.  Serve with greens or [saukerkraut](http://www.reddit.com/r/Paleo/comments/ff58i/make_sauerkraut_at_home/), and something fatty if the roast is lean. Want a simple recipe for hollandaise sauce?   **20 minutes work**:  Get a thick (up to 5 cm / 2 in) steak cut of halibut, clean it and put it on a tray. Pre-heat your oven to 150°C / 300°F. Mince some garlic and sauté in olive oil (or maybe butter, I haven't tried that).  Pour the garlic and oil over the halibut. Put the fish in the oven and roast it until it's done, which is when the meat is just about to get easy to separate from the bones. Be very careful not to overcook it.  Boil some carrots and broccoli while you wait. Hollandaise sauce goes extremely well with this dish also.   **40 minutes of work** (and at least 12 hours of waiting):  Get some marrow bones/scraps/meat leftovers and put them in a huge saucepot together with some onions, carrots and other root vegetables you have lying around, and at least 4 l / a gallon of water.  Leave it on very low heat, just below simmering, for 12 hours or more. Let it cool a bit and strain it through a cheesecloth or fine sieve into another container. You now have bone broth, the **Paleo Super-Ingredient™**. You can freeze it, or leave it in the fridge for maybe 5 days. You can use it in [any soup](http://www.reddit.com/r/Paleo/comments/fy0i2/xpost_from_rfood_beef_bone_marrow_in_buttergarlic/c1jh448)/stew that's not based on seafood.  The fat in the broth will congeal on the surface of the broth. Many recipes tell you to throw this fat away. That is madness.  Now for the actual meal:  Sauté a chopped onion and carrot in a saucepan using some of that wonderful fat. Add some other chopped root vegetables and sauté some more. Pour on a litre or two / 4-8 millihogsheads of broth and bring to a simmer.  Cube some meat while you wait. (Maybe some leftovers from that game roast. Anything will work, even offal). Put the meat in the saucepan when the root vegetables are tender, together with whatever spices you like, and maybe some spinach or parsley. Turn off the heat and wait 15 minutes. You now have dinner.",™

t5_2qh1i,jeannaimard,1300497156,"The bible, which is a crock of bullshit, says that “god” himself gave the Holy-Land™ to the jews (never mind that it was the jews who conveniently invented themselves that “god”).  Some 2000 years ago, the romans got pissed at the jews’ self-righteousness and they expelled them from Palestine, sending them all around the Medditerranean sea, where they thrived and prospered in many places, but never fully integrating with the cultures they moved into.  Over time, Palestine was ruled by various empires, the latest one being the Ottoman empire, which was dissolved following World War one. Followed a british mandate to administer Palestine, where many palestinian peasants did not actually own the land they lived on.  After World War I, some jews who adhered to the zionist movement (that advocated jewish return to Palestine) began to purchase some of that land, kicking out the palestinian tenants that lived on it, and jews started to immigrate. In order to prevent ethnic strife, the british attempted to stop jewish immigration, which led to the rise of jewish terrorist groups such as the Irgun that picked on the british but also exterminated whole palestinian villages (a harbinger of things to come). A member of that terrorist group, Menahem Begin, would eventually rise to head that jewish state.  Came World War II, which was brought about by the germans who insisted that their woes following World War one was brought about by the jews (never mind that they helped a lot to start World War I). When the germans were finally beaten senseless and Prussia (home of the militaristic instincts of Germany) was totally eradicated from the map (it has been split over Poland and Russia), it was discovered that jews had been exterminated over an industrial scale.  Out of a sense of guilt and a lot of arm-twisting, the United Nations eventually approved the creation of a “jewish state” over Palestine, not taking account of the displacement of arabs.  Some claim that the land was purchased alright, but a property is not everything, especially if you don’t care that there are people who rent the land you just sold. This was the basic mistake in assuming that buying the land would be the solution.  The eventual jewish state had pretty convoluted borders, and following nearly two decades of arab hostilities, in 1967, they invaded neighbouring countries and have not ceded the territory back (except Sinaï which was returned to Egypt following a peace treaty in 1979) and have occupied it since.  Many palestinians fled to nearby countries and have been living in refugee camps for decades, straining relations with those countries’ citizens (Lebanon, Jordania), to the point of festering civil wars.  The main point of contention is that a lot of zealot zionists who base themselves on the bible (a crock of bullshit) have took to make settlement colonies in the occupied territories (not ceded back after the 1967 war) and have been effectively stealing the better land and expelling the arabs who lived there.  The repression zionists are inflicting upon the resisting palestinian is rather barbaric and primitive; they do not hesitate to shoot children, they will forcibly demolish arab houses that stand in the way of zionist settlements, the water points are denied to arabs, some roads (the shortest ones) are reserved to zionist settlers, making the arabs’ life more difficult.  In a sense, the zionists are behaving exactly like the americans with regards to native americans; pushing them aside, exterminating them when they resist and putting them into reserves (the refugee camps).  This is what the controversty is about.  Now cue the antisemite* accusations.   \* antisemite = someone the jews don’t like.",™

Every other one was stuck on 1 Digg because nobody noticed them at all, because it was buried in the sea of shitty spam submissions and popular submissions which were brought to the top illegitimately.  To add more fuel on the fire I just built, I was estatic when they removed shouts from Digg, because everybody who would actually friend request you was a spamming cunt who would relentlessly unleash their blogspam onto their friends through shouts. In fact, this was the ONLY way to get your submissions noticed. Once shouts were removed, it certainly removed a lot of my e-mail spam (apart from the wow phishing emails sitting quietly in my Spam folder.)  In reality, it's not only the user's fault for ignoring upcoming submissions and just reading the Digg front-page, but also the developer's fault for only making popular submissions noticeable on the frontpage and not mixing up new, upcoming and popular submissions by default when you go on the site.  In fact, when I clicked ""New"" and ""Upcoming"" on Digg, it became extraordinarily evident how many submissions:  * Were at 1 Digg because nobody ever clicked the New or Upcoming tabs showing immediately how much of a failure the whole recommended submissions idea was. * Were reposts of the same submission. Put it this way, if MrOhHai went to Digg 2 years ago, he would probably explode in rage. * Were blogspam. About 75% of the posts were regurgitated stories from another blog.  Instead, they upped their spam filter (not to the strength of Reddit's) and made their bullshit Recommendation Engine™ which nobody used.  No, it wasn't the shitty Digg ""memes"" that made me quit such as ""Fuck you, two of my friends died...."" or ""This is the best xkcd ever!"", it was this.",™

This means, by way of example only, that checking email, surfing the Internet, downloading legally acquired songs, and/or visiting corporate intranets is permitted, but downloading movies using P2P file sharing services, redirecting television signals for viewing on Personal Computers, web broadcasting, and/or for the operation of servers, telemetry devices and/or Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition devices is prohibited.

t5_2qh2p,TheFlyingBastard,1300663601,"** *Part 2: My Childhood, or How To Stunt Children's Development Of Critical Thought* **  Our religious weeks would consist of visiting our local Hall on tuesday evenings and one evening in the weekend for two hours. The thursday evening was dedicated to ""bookstudy"", which entailed a Q&amp;A study of a book written and printed by the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, the organisation behind Jehovah's Witnesses. (Think the Vatican for Catholics, except way more subtle.)   These studies and meetings were pretty boring. Rarely would we hear something new. We were already thoroughly familiar with the Witness doctrines, and these meetings served as a great reminder of what we believed, why, and why everyone else was wrong. There was another layer to all of this that piqued my interest, though. Sometimes the writers of the publications would speak about the original Greek texts. This fascinated me. I wanted to know more about the *world* of the bible. What does the source text say? Where were these cities? What happened scientifically to the Red Sea? My knowledge of the bible was ever increasing - but only within the confines of Witness material and my own speculation.  I went door-to-door once every two or three weeks. Usually I went in the afternoons. After all, didn't want to wake up the poor people who were still in the Church of Bed, right? How unfortunate that not many people in the congregation shared this thought and insisted mornings were the best time, but what can you do. That said, people aren't that spiritual where I lived. Many never gave it much thought. How was I able to use all this in-depth knowledge if people just didn't care? I couldn't get their attention for these things, so when push came to shove, I sucked at it. So I just kept studying the bible. But inquisitive minds are prone to fall into the trap of good information...  -  ** *Part 3: Apolegetics Phase, or Go Bibleboy!* **  I would often talk to other Jehovah's Witnesses about their experiences. Many said they would often feel blessed that they were in the religion that was so clearly directed by God's Holy Spirit. I never did and that raised some questions. Why did spreading the Truth® never make me feel happy? Was it just me doing something wrong? Why couldn't I spread the good news to people?  So I turned to the internet, where my geekdom would be welcomed and my utter lack of charisma hidden. I subscribed to forums such as CARM (which is the ultimate repository of Christian insanity - you should see it, they've got a secular concentration camp with stickies that say homosexuals are spreading disease. It's amazing.) as well as some other forums in order to spread my faith and defend it from people who spread misinformation about it. Despite the warnings given by the elders (congregational leaders) not to go to these sites, I started participating in discussions with Christians and atheists alike. I needed to know what they thought. How else would I be able to defend my faith while simultaneously decide how to convert them? Know thine enemy and all that.  I identified as a Witness. Immediately Christians hurled abuse at me, calling me a cultist. I ignored them. These people were obviously mentally deficient and could not argue their way out of a wet paper bag. This strengthened my faith; clearly all the stupid people are out there, and all the smart people were Witnesses! But then, there were the atheists. Usually respectful people, who read what I had to say and calmly brought up evidence for their position. Whenever a theist would stop by to proseletyze, they calmly yet firmly refuted the arguments presented. The bible was proven wrong in places. All I could do is look it up on the CD-ROM with Watchtower publications and get a half-assed apologetic explanation. I found the contrast quaint. On the one hand we have the close minded, militant believers, and on the other hand the intelligent, intellectual and thoughtful atheists. It puzzled me; the difference was quite clear.  But I marched on despite this. I would become the voice of reason among the insane theists. I fired up my Watchtower Library on CD-ROM, read an article from the CD and put it in my own words. That way I would understand the point made instead of degrading into cheap copypasting. Then I would wait for the answer. And answers I got. This wasn't how I imagined it. I thought atheists would tell me I had a good point. I thought I could triumphantly declare myself the winner of a discussion about the existence of God and the veracity of the Bible! Instead, they poked many, many holes in my arguments. I got scared. I prayed.  ""Please, God. I want to fight for you. Please, give me strength. Please, give me the wisdom to defend you and glorify your name. I need something to work with, help me!""  Nothing ever came of it.  I retreated.  Months later I returned. The threads I participated in dropped off the first page, and new ones had popped up. I decided to do dust myself off and try again. And what do you know, the same thing happened. I prayed again. I failed. I left. Months later, same thing.

t5_2qhcz,mountaindrew_,1300671627,"Here's the real abstract of the study. Children's psychiatric symptoms don't disappear... There's also a big difference between the levels of behaviour problems of non-remitting and remitting mothers. Children of non-remitting mothers fare much worse in the beginning.  Am J Psychiatry Published March 15, 2011 doi: 10.1176/appi.ajp.2010.10010032 © 2011 American Psychiatric Association  Children of Depressed Mothers 1 Year After Remission of Maternal Depression: Findings From the STAR*D-Child Study  bjective: Maternal major depressive disorder is an established risk factor for child psychopathology. The authors previously reported that 1 year after initiation of treatment for maternal depression, children of mothers whose depression remitted had significantly improved functioning and psychiatric symptoms. This study extends these findings by examining changes in psychiatric symptoms, behavioral problems, and functioning among children of depressed mothers during the first year after the mothers' remission from depression. Method: Children were assessed at baseline and at 3-month intervals with the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children–Present and Lifetime Version, the Child Behavior Checklist, and the Children's Global Assessment Scale for 1 year after their mothers' remission or for 2 years if the mothers did not remit. The authors compared children of early remitters (0–3 months; N=36), late remitters (3–12 months; N=28), and nonremitters (N=16). Results: During the postremission year, children of early-remitting mothers showed significant improvement on all outcomes. Externalizing behavioral problems decreased in children of early- and late-remitting mothers but increased in children of nonremitting mothers. Psychiatric symptoms decreased significantly only in children of mothers who remitted, and functioning improved only in children of early-remitting mothers. Conclusions: Remission of mothers' depression, regardless of its timing, appears to be related to decreases in problem behaviors and symptoms in their children over the year after remission. The favorable effect of mothers' remission on children's functioning was observed only in children of early-remitting mothers.",©

Additionally, an expert panel appointed by the China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) recently concluded that CANDU technology “is the ideal nuclear reactor design to further China’s nuclear power program using thorium as an alternative nuclear fuel source.”  The panel unanimously recommended that China consider building two new CANDU units to take advantage of CANDU’s unique capabilities in utilizing alternative fuels.""  http://www.aecl.ca/Reactors/CANDU_Fuel_Cycles.htm",®

The point of raising this issue isn't to say ""Fox is bad because it's Muslim!"" or even to say ""Fox is hypocritical because it's Muslim,"" the way I see it. The point is to remind people that Fox is a corporation that trades in an infotainment product marketed to a certain demographic of consumer (probably, by all accounts, something like ""the 65+ intellectually insecure angry conservative caucasian market""). It has less to do with hypocrisy and more to do with breaking down the near-religious faith that some Fox News viewers have in the ideas perpetuated by the network.  Behind that snappy branding as the #1 Cable Source for Conservative Truth™ or something lies the same features of any other corporation: investors that do not necessarily share the views of their consumers.

Scientists in Utah have identified a quaking aspen as the biggest living organism on Earth, weighing 6,600 tons!

If you were to go and have a look at it yourself, you'd probably be fooled. It looks like a grove of aspens covering 200 acres. But, they're all part of the same tree.  Scientists took samples from all the aspens in this forest and found that they're all clones - genetically identical. And they're all connected to a single parent tree. New sprouts called suckers grow from the roots of the parent aspen. The suckers are protected by the grove, and the young trees can get their nutrients from the parent's roots until their own are well established.  This may be why quaking aspen is the most widely distributed tree in North America. And aspen root systems can remain dormant for centuries, until the right conditions exist for the suckers to produce the young trees stems, called ramets (there's a new Scrabble® word for you).  And to top it off, by checking out fossilized aspens, scientists have determined that some of these aspen clones may be more than a million years old.

t5_6,ultrawox,1300838204,"Folks should realize that ""race"" is something people long ago made up to explain why slavery could exist in the land of equality, but people got so used to this bullshit that it caused real effects on society.  See the PBS documentary [""Race: The Power of an Illusion.""](http://www.pbs.org/race/000_General/000_00-Home.htm)  Here are 10 quick factoids about race, from the [PBS site:](http://www.pbs.org/race/000_About/002_01_a-godeeper.htm)    ""TEN THINGS EVERYONE SHOULD KNOW ABOUT RACE""  Our eyes tell us that people look different. No one has trouble distinguishing a Czech from a Chinese, but what do those differences mean? Are they biological? Has race always been with us? How does race affect people today?  There's less - and more - to race than meets the eye:  1. Race is a modern idea. Ancient societies, like the Greeks, did not divide people according to physical distinctions, but according to religion, status, class, even language. The English language didn't even have the word 'race' until it turns up in a 1508 poem by William Dunbar referring to a line of kings.  2. Race has no genetic basis. Not one characteristic, trait or even gene distinguishes all the members of one so-called race from all the members of another so-called race.  3. Human subspecies don't exist. Unlike many animals, modern humans simply haven't been around long enough or isolated enough to evolve into separate subspecies or races. Despite surface appearances, we are one of the most genetically similar of all species.  4. Skin color really is only skin deep. Most traits are inherited independently from one another. The genes influencing skin color have nothing to do with the genes influencing hair form, eye shape, blood type, musical talent, athletic ability or forms of intelligence. Knowing someone's skin color doesn't necessarily tell you anything else about him or her.  5. Most variation is within, not between, ""races."" Of the small amount of total human variation, 85% exists within any local population, be they Italians, Kurds, Koreans or Cherokees. About 94% can be found within any continent. That means two random Koreans may be as genetically different as a Korean and an Italian.  6. Slavery predates race. Throughout much of human history, societies have enslaved others, often as a result of conquest or war, even debt, but not because of physical characteristics or a belief in natural inferiority. Due to a unique set of historical circumstances, ours was the first slave system where all the slaves shared similar physical characteristics.  7. Race and freedom evolved together. The U.S. was founded on the radical new principle that ""All men are created equal."" But our early economy was based largely on slavery. How could this anomaly be rationalized? The new idea of race helped explain why some people could be denied the rights and freedoms that others took for granted.  8. Race justified social inequalities as natural. As the race idea evolved, white superiority became ""common sense"" in America. It justified not only slavery but also the extermination of Indians, exclusion of Asian immigrants, and the taking of Mexican lands by a nation that professed a belief in democracy. Racial practices were institutionalized within American government, laws, and society.  9. Race isn't biological, but racism is still real. Race is a powerful social idea that gives people different access to opportunities and resources. Our government and social institutions have created advantages that disproportionately channel wealth, power, and resources to white people. This affects everyone, whether we are aware of it or not.  10. Colorblindness will not end racism. Pretending race doesn't exist is not the same as creating equality. Race is more than stereotypes and individual prejudice. To combat racism, we need to identify and remedy social policies and institutional practices that advantage some groups at the expense of others. 	    © 2003 California Newsreel.

t5_2qk5q,Seele,1300844532,"&gt;The paper, not the ""preliminary analysis"" was what was being discussed earlier as supporting the other surface records.  I get the strong impression that the draft paper that Ken Caldeira wrote about is based on this preliminary analysis, and that it exists only in the most rudimentary form.   In fact, I find the whole affair so far downright confusing. It looks as if he started with the theme that according to Prof. Caldeira's email:   *[...]Their preliminary results sit right within the results of NOAA, NASA, and HadCRU, confirming that prior analyses were correct in every way that matters. Their results confirm the reality of global warming and support in all essential respects the historical temperature analyses of the NOAA, NASA, and HadCRU.[...]*   and a public statement by  Richard Muller:  *“We are seeing substantial global warming” and “None of the effects raised by the [skeptics] is going to have anything more than a marginal effect on the amount of global warming.”*    the BEST project had confirmed the earlier datasets as essentially accurate which was a GOOD THING™. Then he discovers a comment from Steven Mosher:  *[...]There is no DRAFT paper. Ken made a mistake or Joe misrepresented him. There are some draft figures, some charts, that a few of us have seen. These charts are made with 2% of the data.*  Dr. Romm's initial response to this is to dismiss Steven Mosher as being a liar who is not in a position to make any claim about the state of the project. Then he appears to have confirmed somehow that Mosher was indeed involved, and he proceeds to trash Muller, the BEST project  and the climate denial machine in general in an updated version of his article here ([link](http://climatechangepsychology.blogspot.com/)):  *Nail in the coffin of BEST project's credibility: Richard Muller's BEST project not at all independent -- noted climate change denier and misrepresenter of climate science, Steven Mosher, claims (on March 19, 2011) to have already begun writing a paper on the results. Mosher is a noted tool of the Climate Denial Machine*  I suppose we'll have to wait until the smoke clears to get any clear picture of what is going on. Romm seems way over the top.   Edit:- From Romm's article, Steven Mosher comments again:  *Hey Joe,*  *It turns out that Ken did in in fact read a draft paper by the group. It’s just NOT a draft paper on the issue at hand. Its a draft paper on Oceanic indices. That draft paper has a preliminary chart of the global land temp. That preliminary chart is taken from a 2% run.*  *There are 3 other papers the group is working on. So Ken read a draft. That draft paper IS Not the draft on the new approach to calculating the temperature series. That paper has just one or two sections done.*  So, if this is true, then Prof. Caldeira was not referring to a rough but representative form of the finished product. This affair may be somewhat premature after all.",™

t5_2qh6c,palehorse864,1300955831,"Ahh, I see what you're saying.  I think part of the issue, at least for Christians is that our central tenets are that Christ is the center of our salvation. He's referred to as the keystone (The central stone in an archway that supports everything and keeps the whole thing from collapsing).    The centrality of Christian faith is that man has sinned and Christ the Son of God/God himself paid the penalty for our sins on the cross to save us. If we're going to share or tell anyone about our faith at all, we have to cover or at least imply some things.  The fact that he paid for our sins/saved us is the central point of being a Christian. You're someone who Christ has paid for and saved. If we're saved though, that naturally means that we needed saving in the first place. He wouldn't be saving us if we all didn't need saving in the first place. Keep in mind, I'm giving a cliff notes version here that sticks just to certain ideas.    New American Standard Bible (©1995) ""I do not nullify the grace of God, for if righteousness comes through the Law, then Christ died needlessly. (Galatians 2:21).   Christ's sacrifice was necessary because we needed saving and no other method was sufficient, not even attempts at obedience to God's law.  Salvation could only come through Christ.  About the issue of saying our faith is the only one, one issue is that pretty much everyone thinks their faith or unfaith or whatever is the right one mainly because if you didn't think it was the right one, you would go pick another that you did think was right.  There are exceptions, people who don't believe but go through the motions for social reasons, but if you truly believe in something, you believe because you think it's more right than other views.    For a Christian, another central tenet of our Faith is that Christ is the only way, and we largely believe this because the gospels indicate that he said as much.   New American Standard Bible (©1995) Jesus said to him, ""I am the way, and the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father but through Me.  That's Christ saying he's the only way, so it is certainly central to our belief that he is.    If you have to some up the Christian faith though, a lot of people use John 3:16 as a sort of twitter length summary of our faith.    John 3:16 For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.   The idea that Christ died to give us eternal life, and his being the only way to be saved is pretty much the central idea of Christianity.  If you leave any part of that out, you're not really sharing Christianity all that well. You can share lots of points about Christianity, the story of Jesus' birth, the story of his Crucifixion, his resurrection, some stories about hsi disciples, etc. but if it's missing the reason for it all, it can be a hollow story and you aren't really sharing your belief or telling someone it.  I don't think a Christian can truly share Christianity without covering forgiveness through Christ and his being the only way.  Trying to go about it that way might be akin to promising to feed somebody but only giving them an empty lunch box. The idea is there, but the whole point is missing.  I would also suggest that you read the versus surrounding John 3:16, they will explain a lot about why we believe that people are condemned without Christ.  John 3:16 implies that condemnation by saying ""not perish"" which means that those who don't gain eternal life in that way will perish, but the surrounding versus make it much clearer. http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john%203:14-21&amp;version=NIV  That establishes the centrality of these issues to the Christian faith I think, and the need to share them to be sharing Christianity, but I think the question of why Christians need to share may also be a question some have.  Why don't we believe in this centrality and keep it to ourselves, or discuss it with like minded believers?  For one, it would be terrible to believe in this condemnation, and to know  (I know some would say we don't ""know"" but going back to the idea of everyone following a particular belief because they think it's the right one, the Christian at least ""knows"" in their own mind) the way out of condemnation and not try to tell people. It might be like seeing someone walking onto a faulty staircase or blindly toward an open elevator shaft and not telling them there's a problem. They may tell you off for saying it and continue on, but at least tell them and give them a chance to avoid it. We believe in salvation and condemnation, so we believe that to not tell someone is detrimental to that person.  We can save their bodies, give them food, medicine, etc. but doing so without telling them how to protect their eternity means they are still in grave danger.  The other reason, apart from just our concern for those in danger (If you saw someone in physical danger, wouldn't you say something to warn them?) is that after the resurrection, Jesus set down what is known as the ""great commission"" to his disciples. New International Version Matthew 28:18-20  18 Then Jesus came to them and said, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. 19 Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, 20 and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.”  This is what he told his disciples to do and why we share with our neighbors, our families, and other nations and cultures as well. It's a command he gave us to do so.   I hope the idea of the great commission is enlightening, and helps you understand why Christians do what they do in many instances.  Our belief, our religion isn't just going to church and such. A big part is actively reaching out to others and sharing our faith, telling what we believe and informing people about Christ.  They don't have to accept it, we leave that up to them, and they can walk away and say they don't want to hear, but it is a big part of the Christian life to share your testimony with others.    Sharing is a part of our faith, so telling a Christian to not tell others about Jesus, salvation, the need for him to save people from condemnation, etc. is essentially (though that may not be the intent) like telling that Christian ""stop practicing your religion"" or ""quit practicing your religion now"". I know many don't intend for it to come off that way, but a key point in Christianity is to share your beliefs and not leave people in the dark. To fully practice Christianity, we have to share the things above, and to suggest  not sharing or watering down our faith is to suggest that we should just stop practicing our religion. Now, personally, I believe we can be saved and be a Christian before we've done any of this, I'm just saying that the actual practice requires this.  As in my last message, I want to say you have been very respectful in this whole line of questioning and I fear my words in this reply may have come off as a bit direct and harsh sounding in places.  I want to emphasize again that I think you've been respectful and I don't want to come off as talking down to you or accusing you of anything.  I spoke in whatever way the thoughts came into my mind, and in the most direct and clear way I could say these things. I respect that you are wondering about these things and so didn't want to insult you or your request by using a bunch of fluffy nice sounding language that may not really answer your questions.  I think being very direct, explaining what I believe, as well as is possible provides more clarity, even if I do need a disclaimer at the end to explain that my tone is a friendly one. :)",©

t5_2qhc8,Pyrallis,1300969847,"As if the case isn't disturbing enough, it's an example that when it comes to Protecting The Children™, the burden of proof is upon the accused to prove his or her innocence, instead of the authorities to prove guilt. At least in this case, the man was able to prove his innocence by supplying the woman's birth certificate and passport.  This isn't the first time. A man was arrested because a customs officer spotted some porn in his luggage, and thought the actress looked young. Lupe Fuentes, the porn star in question, [actually flew out to the man's trial](http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/2982906/porn_star_helps_new_york_man_accused.html?cat=2) to testify that she was indeed of legal age when that porn was made. It was only by her personal appearance that the man was not convicted. It goes to show that human beings simply cannot properly determine a woman's age in photos. Yet, they blunder ahead anyway, which puts the burden of proof on the innocent suspect. In the US, the assumption of innocence no longer exists for crimes involving children.  The issue of no-knock raids is another kind of evil, especially when, like in this case, the police are acting upon a misguided tip from an idiot informant. This is the type of police activity I used to hear about happening in fascist/totalitarian states. Yet these raids on peoples' homes [happen hundreds of times](http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=6476) each day in the United States. And, most of the raids [aren't even needed;](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/dtuj4/louisiana_man_gets_five_years_for_shooting_two/c12xpja) they simply occur for no other reason than for the police to display a show of force.",™

Apple goes on the record pretty regularly, both to the press and to shareholders, to say they never pay for product placement.  When they're credited for ""promotional consideration,"" that means they either lent their products to the production or just gave them outright for on-screen use at no charge.  Product placement for big-ticket durable goods is *rarely* ever paid for. I can't think of any instances off the top of my head where it was. When GM provides a dozen cars to Michael Bay for his big chase scene, no money changes hands. The production people and the lawyers work it out (and they're *really* good at it; lots of practice) and a truck just shows up on location with the cars on the back and a guy hands over the keys.  A good rule of thumb is that paid product placement is for stuff that wouldn't have cost the production anything to use or not use, like food or drink products, or sometimes store brand names. If you see characters enjoying a Refreshing Pepsi™, that's usually paid product placement. If they go to a Bed, Bath and Beyond it *may* be, or the production might have been allowed to shoot there for free with the cost written off as an in-kind consideration. If they drive Ford cars or use Apple laptops or iPhones, it wasn't paid for; the products were given or lent at no cost instead.",™

As soon as the charges go through, the copyright will be in effect.  5 Print out the Copyright Office registration form and send it through the regular mail, if you prefer the paper version to the Internet. Send the completed application along with a copy of your script.

The greatest thing that can happen to a marriage, is the longing that comes for another that's outside of the marital bond. By having your heart reserved for another, only strengthens your bond with your spouse-to-be. Cherish this love. It will not only make you a better husband, but it will also ensure that when things don't bode well for you and your wife, you'll always have your best man watching your back.   Your wife will also come to appreciate this. Even though you may never tell her of your longing feelings towards your best man, she'll know deep in her heart, that nobody can tickle your prostate like he can - which, will also serve as a vital source of your longevity. Your wife may not be able to feel those lumps, but your buddy-in-waiting certainly will, and what better means to check your rectal wellness than with the cheapest, and most efficient probing of them all?  She may resent this unspoken love. It may even make her cry...but deep in her heart, she knows that it's for the better, and you wouldn't be the honest man that you are today if you didn't have an outlet for your unspoken urges. She will come to respect it, and even embrace it - because even lesbians know that plastic will always pale in comparison to the real thing.  ~*♥ God Bless ♥*~",♥

t5_2qh1q,dhatura,1301232871,"Here is Chomsky on that question.  ""It's difficult to assess blame for historical disasters. It's somewhat like trying to assess blame for the health of a starving and diseased person. There are lots of different factors. Let's say the person was tortured-that certainly had an effect. But maybe when the torture was over, that person ate the wrong diet, lived a dissolute life and died from the combined effects. That's the kind of thing we're talking about. There's no doubt that imperial rule was a disaster. Take India. When the British first moved into Bengal, it was one of the richest places in the world. The first British merchant warriors described it as a paradise. That area is now Bangladesh and Calcutta—the very symbols of despair and hopelessness.  There were rich agricultural areas producing unusually fine cotton. They also had advanced manufacturing, by the standards of the day. For example, an Indian firm built one of the flagships for an English admiral during the Napoleonic Wars. It wasn't built in British factories-it was the Indians' own manufacture.  You can read about what happened in Adam Smith, who was writing over two hundred years ago. He deplored the deprivations that the British were carrying out in Bengal. As he puts it, they first destroyed the agricultural economy and then turned ""dearth into a famine."" One way they did this was by taking the agricultural lands and turning them into poppy production (since opium was the only thing Britain could sell to China). Then there was mass starvation in Bengal.  The British also tried to destroy the existing manufacturing system in the parts of India they controlled. Starting from about 1700, Britain imposed harsh tariff regulations to prevent Indian manufacturers from competing with British textiles. They had to undercut and destroy Indian textiles because India had a comparative advantage. They were using better cotton and their manufacturing system was in many respects comparable to, if not better than, the British system. The British succeeded. India deindustrialized, it ruralized. As the industrial revolution spread in England, India was turning into a poor, ruralized and agrarian country.  It wasn't until 1846, when their competitors had been destroyed and they were way ahead, that Britain suddenly discovered the merits of free trade. Read the British liberal historians, the big advocates of free trade—they were very well aware of it. Right through that period they say: ""Look, what we're doing to India isn't pretty, but there's no other way for the mills of Manchester to survive. We have to destroy the competition.""  And it continues. We can pursue this case by case through India. In 1944, Nehru wrote an interesting book [The Discovery of India] from a British prison. He pointed out that if you trace British influence and control in each region of India, and then compare that with the level of poverty in the region, they correlate. The longer the British have been in a region, the poorer it is. The worst, of course, was Bengal—now Bangladesh. That's where the British were first.  You can't trace these same things in Canada and North America, because there they just decimated the population. It's not only the current ""politically correct"" commentators that describe this—you can go right back to the founding fathers. © 2000 ESubjects Inc. All rights reserved. 1 The first secretary of defense, General Henry Knox, said that what we're doing to the native population is worse than what the conquistadors did in Peru and Mexico. He said future historians will look at the ""destruction"" of these people—what would nowadays be called genocide—and paint the acts with ""sable colors"" [in other words, darkly].  This was known all the way through. Long after John Quincy Adams, the intellectual father of Manifest Destiny, left power, he became an opponent of both slavery and the policy toward the Indians. He said he'd been involved—along with the rest of them—in a crime of ""extermination"" of such enormity that surely God would punish them for these ""heinous sins.""  After the West had robbed the colonies—and they did, no question about that, and there's also no question that it contributed to their own development—they changed over to so-called “neocolonial"" relationships, which means domination without direct administration. After that it was generally a further disaster.  [source - PDF](http://www.esubjects.com/curric/general/world_history/unit_one/pdf/chomsky_prosperousfew.pdf)",©

t5_2qgzg,powercow,1301238898,"&gt;excerpted from ATLA fact sheet. © 1995, 1996 by Consumer Attorneys of California  THIS IS FROM THE LAYWERS FOR THE VICTIM, THIS IS NOT UNBIASED FACTS&gt;  &gt;Judge Frank Easterbrook wrote a unanimous 7th Circuit Court of Appeals opinion affirming dismissal of a similar lawsuit against coffeemaker manufacturer Bunn-O-Matic. The opinion noted that hot coffee (179 °F (82 °C) in this case) is not ""unreasonably dangerous."" The smell (and therefore the taste) of coffee depends heavily on the oils containing aromatic compounds that are dissolved out of the beans during the brewing process. Brewing temperature should be close to 200 °F [93 °C] to dissolve them effectively, but without causing the premature breakdown of these delicate molecules. Coffee smells and tastes best when these aromatic compounds evaporate from the surface of the coffee as it is being drunk. Compounds vital to flavor have boiling points in the range of 150–160 °F [66–71 °C], and the beverage therefore tastes best when it is this hot and the aromatics vaporize as it is being drunk. For coffee to be 150 °F when imbibed, it must be hotter in the pot. Pouring a liquid increases its surface area and cools it; more heat is lost by contact with the cooler container; if the consumer adds cream and sugar (plus a metal spoon to stir them) the liquid's temperature falls again. If the consumer carries the container out for later consumption, the beverage cools still further.[27]",©

Effective immediately, Yeo will report directly to Black. “Yeo launched hetmerk and oversaw the management of our website with excitement and professionalism,” explained Chris Black. “We recognize the value of those sincere qualities in both our employees and partners, so I invited him to participate in our growing venture in a more meaningful manner ndhe has accepted the challenge with gusto.”   Yeo will oversee the next critical phase of the Solamon business plan, and will begin to establish strategic relationships with potential partners in English-speaking territories in the Caribbean and also Belize.   Solamon Energy Corp. designs and installs integrated arrays of ground-mounted photovoltaic cells that are connected by cable to each other and to converters, batteries and transmission points, utilizing 5 acres of land per unit; each unit is called an Apollo Acre™. Solamon is focused on packaging and delivering turnkey systems across the Caribbean, and seeks to open field offices in The Bahamas, Jamaica, Barbados and Puerto Rico.   The company is excited not only to deliver turnkey power plants using renewable energy sources, such as sun and wind, to Caribbean countries but that will also generate jobs locally, in terms of their installation and subsequent maintenance. Our executives are thus not only looking for locations and partners to manage each Apollo Acre™, adds Black, but to also establish a suitable training program for implementation teams in collaboration with relevant government agencies.   For each customer, Solamon Energy Corp. provides full management of each Apollo Acre™ installation, including site inspections, project design and development, as well as environmental and local permitting, 3rd party engineering, procurement, construction and system commissioning.   Over the past few years, Solamon executives have visited numerous countries across the Caribbean and Central America, as well as Morocco and India, to discuss the significant need for new energy in growing economies. These conversations, enjoyed with many people of many professions and backgrounds, have enabled the company to continue its efforts and expand.   Many of these discussions have now turned to implementation. In addition to planning solutions, Solamon is actively pursuing new partners each day to prioritize the most valauble land and the solar farms that will deliver the best local power returns.

For as they are heretics, they cannot be true Christians, because it is not from Christ that they get that which they pursue of their own mere choice, and from the pursuit incur and admit the name of heretics.

t5_2qh2p,Denny_Craine,1301375724,"I studied Buddhism and considered myself a Buddhist in my early teens after I had already decided I wasn't a Christian and had shopped around various religions. I think Buddhism is largely harmless, and many of the teachings of Siddhartha Gautama and the Zen schools are fantastic (don't believe anything, no matter who says it or where you read it, unless it makes since to your critical thinking), however at it's core Buddhism is still an ascetic religion that preaches and encourages abstinence in pretty much anything fun. I think asceticism is for the most part, unhealthy and immoral to teach.   Ultimately I think buddhism is seen as good and friendly by pretty much everyone because buddhism is characterized by a pretty fundamental belief in humanism. But in the end it's still a religion based on rather absurd claims (desire is the root of all suffering), unnecessary for the good parts (humanism) to be practiced, and is not immune to being used to justify atrocities (the Japanese empire, the ongoing violence in Sri Lanka fueled by a belief that Sri Lanka rightly belongs to the Buddhist majority).

I believe that having no religion actually sets your mind free and allows you to be a better person (because of the lack of guilt, cognitive dissonance, extreme dogmatism, etc. caused by religion).

Fox may paint immigrants in a negative light but they also do the opposite many times. Since they occasionally ask very legitimate hard questions to Liberals they are ""permabanned"" on a biased site like Reddit. You just don't see that on a biased site like Reddit.   I am currently studying CS at an american university. My father got his bachelors degree in Canada and his masters degree in the US and he has worked at many good engineering firms in his career. My mother got her bachelors in Pakistan but got her masters in the US and she also has had a very good career in Microbiology thus far.   &gt;Like in the video above, doctors sometimes move to Canada expecting to be able to practice, only to find they need all sorts of re-qualification exams etc.  That is true. If you went to a medical school that is not WHO certified you will have trouble in both the US and Canada. The commercial was not implying that though. The commercial was a failed attempt to change the minds of Canadians who don't look at an individual's talents but more at their ethnicity. It is a difference in culture. The US has and is continuing to become more and more integrated in society. Employers, especially in the sciences realize that colleges are graduating so many non-white people that if they become all Canadian style racist and not hire they are essentially fucked business-wise.  Since corporations care about the all might dollar and if all they have are minorities that fit the job description then those are the people that are gonna get hired. Canada while gaining more diversity is still like a ""salad"". Since there is a smaller job market in Canada, employers can pick and choose and still deny there is racism resulting in commercials like what I linked to.   &gt;Any experience or anecdotes you can share regarding the US?  What kind of experience or anecdotes do you want? Where are you from? The reason I ask is that based on your past comments you seem like the type of person that thinks they have the whole world figured out, essentially a ""typical Redditor ™ ""   I can tell you then when September 11 happened, I was in the 8th grade and really worried but the next day, nothing happened. I interacted normally with students. Nobody ever said anything during my whole school career even when the war in Iraq started and the country was in a frenzy to ""blow some shit up"" and I continued my educational experience on good terms with everyone in my school and town all the way to graduation. I don't see job discrimination too much either seeing as a majority of my friends who have graduated in the last few years have all been hired right out of college and are making salaries from 50,000 to 70,000$ starting which is about double the national average. So these so called ""minorities"" are making more money than most white people. This is why I get so offended at stupid Reddit comments such as yours with no research into how much this country has helped minorities achieve things that they probably would not be able to anywhere else on this planet.

t5_2qh1a,aphexairlines,1301491809,"With its new generation of 2011 Vaio™ notebooks, Sony will allow advanced developers to unlock the boot loader in a secure and legal way. We will enable this opportunity later this spring, although it will only be possible for certain releases of these notebooks.  Find out the details after the jump.   Over the few last years, Sony has received several requests from the Windows™ and Linux communities to allow advanced developers to unlock the boot loader of their notebooks. Up to now, the answer has been “No”. The reason is that we haven’t had a secure technical solution in place to support this. Furthermore, the boot loader could not be shared since that would violate important business agreements with many of our partners, such as ISP customers and developers who want to protect their apps and games from being ripped from the secure area in the notebooks.  But we are developing a solution for this. It will be possible to unlock the boot loader for certain releases of our 2011 Vaio™ notebooks. But it is important to point out that this will only be possible for certain releases of the notebooks.  Basically, your notebook has to fulfill a number of requirements. For example, you can’t unlock the boot loader if you have a cablecard lock protected notebook.  There are other requirements as well, depending on your market and the original configuration of your notebook. The only way to determine if you can unlock the boot loader for your notebook is to connect your notebook to the PhoenixBIOS Setup tool in the Windows™ or Linux SDKs. If your notebook can connect to PhoenixBIOS Setup, the boot loader can be unlocked. For earlier products, we cannot allow the boot loader to be unlocked due to technical and legal reasons.  Also, please note that you may **void the warranty of your notebook if you unlock the boot loader**. See your notebook’s warranty statement for details.  Additionally, due to the modified notebook software, Sony’s repair network may not be able to properly test and repair your notebook according to our normal procedures.  Consequently, if Sony does perform a warranty repair, Sony may charge you a **handling fee** for any additional incurred costs due to your modification of the software.  If you unlock the boot loader and then install a custom unsigned OS to your notebook like Microsoft's latest Windows offering or a Linux distribution, the custom unsigned OS will not have gone through the thorough tests that we run for each notebook and software version that we release. Because of that, the custom unsigned OS might not work properly on your notebook. Certain functions may cease to work, and the performance of the device might not be ideal. You might damage your notebook permanently. In worst case, it will cause **physical injuries** or **material damage**, for example, due to the notebook overheating on your lap.  Therefore, you should only unlock the boot loader of your notebook if you are an advanced developer with good knowledge of the technology and risks involved. **We strongly recommend that standard users NOT unlock the boot loader**, as it is not needed. We are proud to deliver great notebook experiences through our rigorously tested and official software releases.  However, we hope that this is a useful service for advanced developers, and demonstrates that Sony is listening to and working with the open developer world. We will provide more details about this service later this spring. Stay tuned for more information…  Note: To enable this, we will later launch a web service where an unlock boot loader key can be retrieved by entering your MAC address. This key will be used in PhoenixBIOS Setup where you perform the actual unlock boot loader sequence. A more detailed instruction will be provided later, when this service is available.    Depending on the original configuration of your notebook, it will be either be possible or not possible to unlock the boot loader. No notebook updates are required to enable this functionality.",™

Edit: Here is the email I sent(I'm sure I could of done better but I suck at writing):  This email is in response to your article “Sniper rifle photo draws ire of social media critics” that was posted to your newspaper and website. (http://www.torontosun.com/news/columnists/joe_warmington/2011/03/16/17646396.html#/news/columnists/joe_warmington/2011/03/16/pf-17645821.html and http://i.imgur.com/1PTyS.jpg)  I am the photographer who took the original photo and subsequently posted it on www.reddit.com under the user name “YougnZeebra”. By using it on your website and newspaper without my permission or knowledge you have violated my copyright of the picture, imposed by the website www.imugr.com where the picture was originally hosted.   “All files are copyrighted © to their respective owners. Imgur directs full legal responsibility of files to their respective users.”  You also acknowledge the use of this website to obtain the photo by stating the number of views the picture has in the following quote:  “has already received over 321,000 views on the Internet.”  In regards to this copyright infringement, I will be expecting fair compensation for your use of this picture as well as extra for using it in the first place without my consent.  Youngzeebra  I will keep you guys up do date on what their reply is.  Update 1: So the journalist replied telling me to contact his editor in chief directly, so I did. The editor in chief then replied that he would get his photo editor in touch with me tomorrow, since he's out of the office today.  Update 2: Told to Editor in chief TLDR: I don't want to wait until tomorow. Give me money now  Update 3: After no response from my email I tried to call him when I came home from work. Sadly no answer and his VM was full (You guys wouldn't have to do anything with this right?) Hopefully something will come out of this tomorrow.  Update 4: Well today was sort of productive if any1 still cares. They made an offered  to me and I rejected it. I made a counter offer. After not getting a reply I called them up. Said they still needed time to ""Discuss"" it. Said they would have an answer for me by tomorrow morning.  ***Final update*: so yesterday they offered me 150$, the standard price for a front page picture. I refused it of course and said I deserved more. They replied with ""Our standard rate is $85 for an inside picture. For a photo that is used in paper and online, the rate is $100. Mr. Editor in chief has offered you more than the standard rate."" I countered saying that copyright infringement is worth more then 50 IMO. I counter offered with only 250$ because I didn't want to ask too much and run the chance of sparking a legal battle, That I would not have the time to fight. They said they would talk it over. This morning they sent me an email agreeing to give me 250$. All in all, 250$ isn't that bad considering I had no plans of making money off of the picture in the first place until they stole it. I'm sure you guys will think this is a let down and that I could of gotten more but c'est la vie!**  **Once I get the cheque and (Hopefully) a letter of apology that I asked for, I'll take a picture of it to and post it on /r/pics to prove I wasn't trolling if anyone wants me to.**",©

t5_2qnmr,jeannaimard,1301600365,"&gt; Something to note: rental listings in Quebec are different than pretty much everywhere else due to the architecture. Purpose-built apartments from the pre-1950s (which is most of the apartments you'll be looking at) had a lot of flexible rooms, so the standard is to refer to apartments by the number of total rooms, rather than the number of bedrooms.  Beware of the infamous «salons doubles» (“double rooms”)!!!! It’s like the silly balcony-from-a-closet in Vancouver.  Very often, flats are very narrow and stuck together, so there are no windows on the side. So builders have been creative by making one huge room with two doors, separated in the middle by a very wide door/arch. Many people will count this as two rooms, so when you call to visit a flat, make sure you ask if it has double rooms. You may avoid an useless visit.

t5_2qnmr,jeannaimard,1301602944,"Okay. Time for a “mise au poing”…  There are a lot of “Canadien français” that go a long way to look like they are english. You’ll find plenty of those working for CN and in the Army, where they learned a long time ago that if you were french, you had no chance of being promoted.  Those “canadiens français” are so extremely colonized that they have become undistinguishable from the english, your rant about “fucking taxes” and “other peoples’ money” is very petty-bourgeois/anglo-saxon. You seem to be one such case, and therefore I have much less sympathy towards you than I have for a bona-fide bloke. You have been back-stabbing us for so long that we don’t care much about you.  You are so colonized that you have not realized that if Québec becomes independent, your life will improve much, because we will have reciprocal treaties to treat the english in Québec as well as the french are in Canada, something that Canada has consistently refused to do since that, given the english are extremely well treated in Québec, Canada would never accept to treat the french as well.  As of “Québécois de souche™”, that’s totall bullshit. There is no “souche” of Québécois; we came from France, one of the most racially-mixed people on Earth (for 10,000 years, all the invasions of Europe finished up in France, and when we came here, we mixed-up with the indians).

I honestly don't understand how anyone could even consider doing that to another person, oh my god. I'm really glad you're managing to get over her though. You deserve better!  The PCOS is such a bitch. Are you on any medication for it? I was on birth control for a while then my doctor stopped prescribing it... it didn't really help with the weight (which is what they were focussing on) but I think it helped with hair growth and my skin, except she couldn't/didn't want to see it so I'm not on anything now. :( I really should register with a doctor here and see what they say but I haven't been sick so never really bothered. I'll have to make the effort to do it after Easter.  I'm also going to call up the counselling service once I'm back from Easter holidays. Thanks for the suggestions on what to talk/ask about - one of the reasons I've been putting it off is because I have a lot of trouble articulating how I'm feeling even if I can pinpoint the cause. When I went last time I felt triggered by a certain event and I feel that was kind of all they wanted to talk about even though there were underlying issues, but when I go next I'll make a list of talking points so I can concentrate on what's important. It did help, though. I resolved to be a lot more outgoing and talk to people more, and I do, and I have a lot more friends now but they're kind of more 'good acquaintances'. I would hang out with them while at uni, but wouldn't ask them to do anything spontaneous or go out for a meal or watch a film with them or anything. It's nice knowing a lot more people though and I think I would be feeling a lot worse if I hadn't made that effort. I'm just not very good at getting closer to people than that.  But it's good to hear a success story, thank you for sharing. Good luck with your own journey! ♥",♥
