t5_2qqlo,Moffel,1312223732,"How about this study, for instance? http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022437582900160  'Anonymous random digit dialing telephone surveys of nearly 6000 16–19 year old respondents were conducted in Massachusetts and Upstate New York in 1979–1981. These surveys explored frequency of driving after using marijuana, driving after drinking, respondent accident involvement in the year prior to the interview, and a variety of other respondent characteristics. Frequency of driving after using marijuana and after drinking were each associated with greater accident involvement. To isolate the accident risk of driving after marijuana use, respondents who drove after drinking were excluded from a logistic regression analysis. This analysis also controlled for the distance respondents drove and several respondent demographic characteristics. Compared to respondents who did not drive after marijuana use, teenageers who drove after smoking marijuana on at least 6 occasions per month were 2.4 times more likely to be involved in traffic accidents. Those who drove after marijuana use on at least 15 occasions per month were 2.9 times more likely to have an accident.'  Or this one, from the producers of medicinal marijuana?  http://www.nhtsa.gov/People/injury/research/job185drugs/cannabis.htm  'The drug manufacturer suggests that patients receiving treatment with Marinol® should be specifically warned not to drive until it is established that they are able to tolerate the drug and perform such tasks safely. Epidemiology data from road traffic arrests and fatalities indicate that after alcohol, marijuana is the most frequently detected psychoactive substance among driving populations. Marijuana has been shown to impair performance on driving simulator tasks and on open and closed driving courses for up to approximately 3 hours. Decreased car handling performance, increased reaction times, impaired time and distance estimation, inability to maintain headway, lateral travel, subjective sleepiness, motor incoordination, and impaired sustained vigilance have all been reported. Some drivers may actually be able to improve performance for brief periods by overcompensating for self-perceived impairment. The greater the demands placed on the driver, however, the more critical the likely impairment. Marijuana may particularly impair monotonous and prolonged driving. Decision times to evaluate situations and determine appropriate responses increase. Mixing alcohol and marijuana may dramatically produce effects greater than either drug on its own.'

t5_2qm4e,iorgfeflkd,1312234993,"&gt;Five drug-free male subjects ingested marijuana-laced brownies in a double-blind crossover study designed to test for behavioral effects, physiologic effects, and urinary cannabinoid metabolites produced as a result of consumption of marijuana plant material cooked in foodstuff. On three separate occasions, each subject consumed two brownies which contained 1.6 g of marijuana plant material. Placebo marijuana plant material (0% THC) was mixed with marijuana plant material (2.8% THC) so that each subject ingested equivalent marijuana plant material of 0, 1, and 2 marijuana cigarettes (2.8% THC). Subjects scored significantly higher on behavioral measures after consumption of brownies containing THC than with placebo; however, the effects were slow to appear and variable. Peak effects occurred 2.5 to 3.5 h after dosing. Modest changes in pulse and blood pressure also were noted. Urinalyses by EMIT® d.a.u. assay and Abuscreen® RIA for cannabinoids and GC/MS assay for THCCOOH indicated that substantial amounts of marijuana-related metabolites were excreted over a period of 3 to 14 days. No positives were produced as a result of ingestion of placebo brownies.

Además la Administración para el Control de Drogas de Estados Unidos (DEA, por sus siglas en inglés) dio aviso en años pasados a los principales líderes del Cártel de Sinaloa de operativos policiales en su contra para que pudieran huir, afirmó Zambada Niebla.   Como parte de una solicitud para desechar el proceso criminal que enfrenta ante la Corte Federal del Distrito Norte de Illinois, el hijo de Ismael ""El Mayo"" Zambada afirmó que Washington dio inmunidad a los capos contra cualquier proceso criminal en EU.  ""El Vicentillo"", quien está preso en Chicago luego de ser extraditado en 2010, afirma que el acuerdo se concretó antes de 2004 a través de Humberto Loya-Castro, abogado del Cártel e informante de EU, y que le fue refrendado personalmente por agentes estadounidenses en una reunión en 2009.   ""En algún momento anterior a 2004, y siguiendo a lo largo del periodo cubierto por esta acusación, el Gobierno de Estados Unidos entró a un acuerdo con Loya y el liderazgo del Cártel de Sinaloa, incluidos 'El Mayo' y 'El Chapo'"", asegura el testimonio presentado el pasado viernes por la defensa.  ""Bajo el acuerdo, el Cártel de Sinaloa, a través de Loya, iba a proveer al Gobierno de Estados Unidos información acopiada por 'El Mayo', 'El Chapo' y otros, contra organizaciones rivales de tráfico de drogas mexicanas"", agrega.  Informante desde 1998 para la Administración para el Control de Drogas (DEA, por sus siglas en inglés), Loya Castro fue descrito por la defensa como un confidente de los líderes del Cártel de Sinaloa y a quien, cumpliendo el acuerdo, se le habría desechado un proceso criminal que enfrentó en 2008 en California.   ""Como reciprocidad, el Gobierno de Estados Unidos acordó: desechar el proceso del caso pendiente contra Loya, no interferir con sus actividades tráfico de drogas (de Loya) ni aquellas del Cártel de Sinaloa, a no procesar activamente a (Loya), ni al 'El Chapo', ni al 'El Mayo' ni el liderazgo del Cártel de Sinaloa y a no arrestarlos"", agrega.   Vicente Zambada Niebla, quien tiene mañana miércoles una cita ante la Corte, aseguró que la inmunidad le fue ratificada personalmente por agentes de la DEA durante una reunión en el hotel Sheraton del DF en marzo de 2009, horas antes de ser arrestado por el Gobierno de México.   Las reuniones con la DEA  Según un testimonio escrito (moción) presentado ante la Corte federal, ""El Vicentillo"" afirmó que agentes de la DEA le reiteraron verbalmente dicha inmunidad en una reunión en un hotel del Distrito Federal horas antes de ser arrestado por el Ejército mexicano y la PGR la madrugada del 18 de marzo de 2009.   ""Siguiendo el acuerdo (con EU), Loya acordó que el señor Zambada Niebla se encontrara con agentes del Gobierno de Estados Unidos en el hotel Sheraton de la Ciudad de México en marzo de 2009"", agrega la defensa en otra moción que asegura que contaba con la venia de agentes de EU.  ""Ésta (reunión tenía) el fin de presentar al señor Zambada Niebla a los agentes y con el propósito de continuar proveyendo personalmente de información a la DEA y al Gobierno de Estados Unidos y ya no a través de Loya"", agrega la moción de la defensa que describe la reunión en el DF.   De acuerdo con los documentos, Zambada acudió a dicha reunión bajo gran riesgo físico para él y en ella estuvieron presentes un supuesto agente de la DEA de nombre ""Manny"" -con el que Loya trabajaba- así como otro agente llamado ""David"" quienes le confirmaron el acuerdo de inmunidad.   ""En la reunión (del Sheraton) quedó claro que el acuerdo existente con Estados Unidos -que cubría a Loya y el acusado y por el que el acusado estaba bajo inmunidad de sus acciones- estaba vigente y continuaría"", agrega la defensa encabezada por los abogados George Santangelo y Ed Panzer.   ""Al acusado le fue dicho específicamente que recibiría inmunidad no sólo a partir del acuerdo anterior con Loya, sino por un acuerdo con él personalmente y aprobado a los más altos niveles del Gobierno (de EU)"", agrega la defensa, asegurando que los agentes agradecieron a Zambada Niebla por datos.  ""Al señor Zambada Niebla se le dijo (en la reunión) que una acusación basada en Washington, DC, sería desechada y que estaría inmune de cualquier proceso"", asegura otra moción de la defensa, recordando que ""El Vicentillo"" tenía ya una acusación previa a la que afronta actualmente.  ""Hubo evidencia que en el hotel, el señor Zambada Niebla aceptó el acuerdo y que de ahí en adelante el señor Zambada Niebla proveería de más datos sobre cárteles de droga rivales. Al señor Zambada Niebla le fue dicho por los agentes del Gobierno que estaban satisfechos con la información que les proveería y que haría arreglos para volverlo a ver"", añade.  Dentro de los documentos presentados por la defensa, Zambada Niebla asegura que hay muchos antecedentes de que la DEA se basa en acuerdos de colaboración con informantes dentro del narcotráfico para datos de criminales por lo que el caso del Cártel de Sinaloa no sería la excepción.   Los 'pitazos'  Ante la Corte federal del Distrito Norte de Illinois, la defensa de ""El Vicentillo"" afirmó que tiene pruebas que la DEA tuvo comunicación indirecta con Ismael ""El Mayo"" Zambada y con Joaquín ""El Chapo"" Guzmán como muestra de que EU le otorgó inmunidad el liderazgo del Cártel.   De acuerdo con la moción legal de ""El Vicentillo"", la DEA informó a ""El Chapo"" y ""El Mayo"" de operativos en su contra a través del abogado Humberto Loya Castro.  ""La defensa tiene evidencia que de tiempo en tiempo, el liderazgo del Cártel de Sinaloa fue informado por agentes de la DEA, a través de Loya, si agentes del Gobierno de Estados Unidos y/o autoridades mexicanas realizaban investigaciones cerca de los territorios que son hogar de los líderes del Cártel"", apunta el documento sin citar casos.  ""(Esto) para que los líderes del Cártel tomaran acciones apropiadas para evadir a los investigadores aún cuando el Gobierno de Estados Unidos mantenía acusaciones, solicitudes de extradición y recompensas por la aprehensión de 'El Mayo', 'El Chapo' y otros supuestos líderes así como por el señor Zambada Niebla"", añade el documento.  De acuerdo con el documento presentado por la defensa ante la Corte, tanto los miembros del Cártel como la DEA sabían que el abogado Loya Castro servía como correo entre ellos y que la propia agencia de EU -junto a otras- lo habían vuelto informante desde 1998.  Piden retomar 'Rápido y Furioso'  La defensa de Vicente ""El Vicentillo"" Zambada pidió a una Corte federal considerar incluir datos del operativo ""Rápido y Furioso"" -por el que Estados Unidos habría permitido el tráfico vigilado de armas a México- como pruebas de que EU mantenía un pacto de inmunidad con el Cártel de Sinaloa.  ""Las solicitudes de Zambada Niebla están enfocadas en obtener información gubernamental para determinar si líderes y/o miembros del Cártel de Sinaloa estuvieron entre los individuos que recibieron armas (de Rápido y Furioso)"", asegura la solicitud incluir datos del operativo como prueba.

This letter will definitely come to you as a huge surprise, but I implore you to take the time to go through it carefully as the decision you make will go off a long way to determine the future and continued existence of the entire members of my people.  Please allow me to introduce myself. My name is Rt. Hon. Sir. Anomander Purake, the lord of High House Dark, former head of state and commander in chief of the armed forces of the federal republic of Moon's Spawn who escaped its destruction in 1164th year of Burn's Sleep.  My ordeal started immediately after my domain's utter destruction during Battle of Black Coral, in 1164th year of Burn's Sleep and the subsequent scattering of my people and take-over of government of Coral by the new administration of Malazan Empire. The present Malazan government is determined to portray all the good work of my people in a bad light and have gone as far as confiscating all my late kingdom's assets, properties, freezing our accounts both within and outside Coral. As I am writing this letter to you, my sole ally, Caladan Brood, is undergoing questioning with the government. All these measures taken by past/present government is just to gain international recognition.  I and the entire members of my people have been held incommunicado since the destruction of Moon's Spawn, hence I seek your indulgence to assist us in securing these funds. We are not allowed to see or discuss with anybody. Few occasions I have tired traveling abroad through alternative means all failed.  It is in view of this I have mandated Dr Kruppe, who has been assisting the family to run around on so many issues to act on behalf of the family concerning the substance of this letter. He has the full power of attorney to execute this transaction with you.  My late domain had/has Eighty Million UVT (⬆80,000,000.00) specially preserved and well packed in trunk boxes of which only I knew about. It is packed in such a way to forestall just anybody having access to it. It is this sum that I seek your assistance to get out of Coral as soon as possible before the present civilian government finds out about it and confiscate it just like they have done to all my peoples' assets.  I implore you to please give consideration to my predicament and help a widow in need.  May Mother Dark show you mercy as you do so?  Your faithfully,  Rt. Hon. Sir.

Do you know what they use?  Sugar.  Dextrose, sucrose, and maltodextrin.  (Maltodextrin is corn syrup solids composed primarily from fructose and glucose in a starch form.)   All sweetener packets are at least 96 percent sugar.  Splenda is 99% sugar.  The packets are labelled calorie free as a result of manipulating a loophole in the food labeling laws.  The product can be described as sugar free if a serving contains less than 5 grams of sugar, and calorie free if a serving is less than 5 calories.  So they set the serving size on bags at .5 grams  and the packets contain a serving of 1 gram.  A one gram packet contains 4 calories.   This can be confirmed on the manufacturer’s website in the FAQ section:  “Like many no and low calorie sweeteners, each serving of SPLENDA® No Calorie Sweetener contains a very small amount of common food ingredients, e.g., dextrose and/or maltodextrin, for volume. Because the amount of these ingredients is so small, SPLENDA® No Calorie Sweetener still has an insignificant calorie value per serving and meets FDA’s standards for “no calorie” sweeteners. “  http://jstevens.wordpress.com/2008/02/20/how-sucralose-aka-splenda-is-made-and-why-you-want-to-avoid-it/",24589,1194,0,0,1,1,®

Entre las carnes , el plato estrella es los saltimboca a la romana , pequeÃ±os filetes de ternera cubiertos de una loncha de jamÃ³n y una hoja de salvia . TambiÃ©n el cordero tiene gran importancia . Roma es un paraÃ­so para los amantes de casquerÃ­a que es muy tÃ­pica del barrio de Trastevere .

One sexually promiscuous woman lowers the sexual value of *all* the women in her group/cohort/community. It's basic evolutionary psychology.   Genetically, we're all cavemen and women. And the cavewoman part of female genes wants to find a man who will (a) impregnate her and (b) stick around long enough provide resources to support their children because pregnancy, birth, lactation, and childrearing require tons of energy.   But a woman who provides sex without also demanding a long-term investment from the man lowers the incentive for *all* men to commit to sexual partners. In contrast, men aren't threatened by a promiscuous man (provided the promiscuous man doesn't have sex with his *his* wife).    It's a double standard rooted deeply in our biology.

t5_2qknj,plumbob,1312485842,"Hey man, I need to disclose that I own a company that makes and sells Arduino boards. But here is my advice:  One of the toughest limiting factors with experimenting with boards is soldering surface mount components, so if you go with a kit, look to see how much of it is through-hole versus surface mount. Some kits even allow you to easily remove the Atmega chip, which means you can easily swap it out if you fry it accidentally. So, I'd definitely look for a through hole kit starting out. Plus, it will really give you a good feel of everything involved with making the board work.  Secondly, if you want to tinker a lot, get a dedicated FTDI breakout board. This is handy if you ever want to try something OTHER than an Arduino board (like LaunchPad®) and you want a common interface library to build your software off of it.   Finally, don't blow everything on the Arduino board itself. The sensors and motors are the most fun part! I recently built a low powered radar that could detect motion behind walls off a $10 Arduino board and a 9V battery. You don't need a lot of components to interface with with the ADC.

t5_2qh1i,elohim_algebra,1312682551,"&gt;I'm not interested in getting laid, I'm interested in finding a peer who I can share mutual respect with.  I suggest you focus on getting laid, at least initially and at least in terms of your mindset. Here's why:   Getting laid (or getting in touch with your sexual side) will do more than anything else to boost your confidence with women. You'll walk differently. You'll talk differently. You'll radiate a different energy, and women will react to that energy. In a way, women often can't respect you as a Man® unless you want to fuck them. You send off a ""just friends"" vibe that is not attractive. If you want a girlfriend, you'll need to send a sexual vibe that makes her pelvis twitch.    Some of the seduction community stuff *is* sleazy. But (a) you don't have to use it all and (b) most girls want to be seduced or lured, and the seduction community stuff is generally useful at teaching tricks that women actually respond to. Think of it as a buffet: take what you want, leave the remainder.   For example, the ""three second rule"" is *very* helpful and non-scummy. It simply states that if you're interested in a girl, you talk to her within three seconds of meeting/seeing her. If you wait, you'll second guess yourself, try to build up courage, think of the right thing to say, etc. But if you quickly start talking, before you get into ""paralysis by analysis"" mode, you'll do a lot better.   If there's a seduction group in Portland, they'd probably be willing to give you some pointers on how to speak, what to say, awareness of your body language, etc. Think of it as fantasy camp training for when you meet someone you like.   Of course, sex is not all you want from her if you're looking for a serious relationship. In fact, some studies indicate that postponing sex by at least a few months leads to better long-term relationships for men (see Jack Kammer's free e-book ""If Men Have All The Power, How Come Women Make All The Rules?) But sex is a big part of a serious relationship, and you need to be okay with your sexual desires.   Have you ever seen *Legends of the Fall*? There's a funny scene where brothers Tristan (Brad Pitt) and Samuel (Henry Thomas) are discussing Samuel's girlfriend:   Tristan: Samuel, God bless you. You are good at everything you try to do. I'm sure it'll be the same with fucking. Samuel: Tristan, really. We're talking about my future wife. Tristan: Oh, you're not gonna fuck her? Samuel: No! Tristan: No? Samuel: No! I'm planning to be with her. Tristan: I recommend fucking.   Girls want to fuck, too, and they prefer guys who want to fuck. And they watch that movie repeatedly because they want to fuck Brad Pitt (or Aiden Quinn), not Henry Thomas.   You didn't mention any sexual abuse or other trauma in your life that might result in difficulty with the opposite sex. So my guess is that you just need more practice. Make a habit of talking to ALL women whenever you have a chance. Don't wait until you see some cute girl. It might be good to make a homework assignment out of it. Go to the mall, walk into every other store, talk to a female clerk or salesperson, no matter if she's old, young, fat, skinny, whatever (leave your wallet in the car so you're not pressured into buying anything). Ask for recommendations about whatever she's selling. Ask her to explain the differences between Product X and Z. Make small talk. You'll gradually get better at it, and earn more confidence.   Good luck. ",8,1,0,0,1,1,®

Anyone who may have had a sexual encounter with Peterson is encouraged to seek medical attention.  Two individuals have made complaints to police, and the Sexual Assault Section has now launched an investigation.  Under the Criminal Code of Canada, failure to disclose your status if you are HIV positive can lead to aggravated sexual assault charges.  Peterson is a minor, and under normal circumstances police would not be able to name her, but EPS has obtained a court order to do so.  Police also say that Peterson is not a prostitute, but she is very sexually active.  She frequently spends time in the Whyte Avenue area, but at this time her whereabouts are unknown.  Anyone who knows of Peterson's whereabouts or has been sexually involved with her is asked to call police at 780-423-4567 or Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-TIPS. © Copyright (c) Shaw Media Inc.",11,1,0,0,0,1,©

t5_2qh13,mvlazysusan,1312714222,"&gt;More than 99 percent of both natural and depleted uranium consists of the isotope U-238. One gram of pure U-238 has a specific activity of 12.4 kBq, which means there are 12,400 atomic transformations every second, each of which releases an energetic alpha particle. Uranium 238 has a half life of 4.51 E+9 (or 4.51 times 10 to the 9thpower, equivalent to 4,510,000,000 years).  &gt;Each atomic transformation produces another radioactive chemical: first, uranium 238 produces thorium 234, (which has a half life of 24.1 days), then the thorium 234 decays to protactinium 234 (which has a half life of 6.75 hours), and then protactinium decays to uranium 234 (which has a half life of 2.47E+5 or 247,000 years). The first two decay radioisotopes together with the U 238 count for almost all of the radioactivity in the depleted uranium.   http://www.ccnr.org/du_hague.html    &gt;DU munitions are classified by a United Nations resolution as illegal weapons of mass destruction. Their use breaches all international laws, treaties and conventions forbidding poisoned weapons calculated to cause unnecessary suffering.  &gt;According to a report by the UN subcommission, laws which are breached by the use of DU shells include: the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; the Charter of the United Nations; the Genocide Convention; the Convention Against Torture; the four Geneva Conventions of 1949; the Conventional Weapons Convention of 1980; &amp; the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907.   &gt;Dr. Asaf Durakovic, a professor of nuclear medicine at Georgetown University, is a former army medical expert. He told nuclear scientists in Paris last year that tens of thousands of sick British and American soldiers are now dying from radiation they encountered during Gulf War I. He found that 62 percent of sick vets tested have uranium isotopes in their organs, bones, brains and urine. Laboratories in Switzerland and Finland corroborated his findings. In other studies, some sick vets were found to be expressing uranium even in their semen. **Their sexual partners often complained of a burning sensation during intercourse, followed by their own debilitating illnesses**.      http://www.afge171.org/news/20050330DU.htm   Um...

Written and Edited by John R. Hernandez, Jr.  All source quotes have no editing except where emphasis used  What I love the most about those that leave such kind words on my htt://www.newdawnwordpress.com webpage is that many are being sincere and most are actually website owners who honestly took a look or two and found my site and information helpful to them enough to admit to me and to all of us in their own words. My blessing and thanks for all of those who have stood up and helped another fellow website owner receive the accolades from his fellow writers and producers as they feel merit’s it. My special and long overdue thanks to wordpress.com still the best on the internet by far over all the pothers!     From free jsp web hosting on “Poetry I LOVE and My Views and Comments”   “I enjoy your writing style really enjoying this internet site.”    From Katerine Bloedel on “Comments; Values and Morals; and whatever else they don’t want us to know!”   “Great post, but I’m having some problems subscribing to your RSS Feed, anyway l love reading your post.”  REPLY TO RSS FEED PROBLEMS; Hi Katerine, I did check out the feeds and it worked out fine. Sorry you had trouble with it. Try again another time and see what happens and then let me know. Maybe we can figure something out to fix the issue. Anyway, thanks for your sweet and kind words about the site. Sometimes, some people don’t realize what it takes to publish books and write these stories. And when few people show up and leave comments; it makes for example, the 20 hours I spent on Sunday the 7th of August, 2011 putting that day’s page together -with so many problems from wordpress- humbling. But then, when I come by and see comments like yours and all the rest; it makes 2011 worth the while. I am glad that you and everyone else enjoys the stories and I am hoping one day -soon- all of you will unearth the treasure of beautiful poetry found in my book. “In the Birth of a New Dawn”. Now found on (Smashwords.com DISCOUNT CODE RK42A), Kobo.com, Scrollmotion.com, Diesel.com, Apple.com and Barnes &amp; Noble.com!

By all means share what I have posted here with your friends and readers and remember if at all possible to place a site somewhere on your page back to my page and or just a few words on our collaborative efforts to make this world a better place by partnering our pages and helping people to get a more fair and balanced view.

Hernandez, Jr. (c) 2011                                  From my new book “Beyond the Dawn”  Together the rain ceases, the sweltering moments of despair fade, the countless moments of hopelessness seem distant; once again. Even these waves once restless and foreboding seem nimble and faint before your smile. To the beating of our hearts, to when our eyes first met, to the depth between our touch; as long as, and whenever you and I are here in thought.

Hernandez, Jr. © 8/2011   http://www.newdawnmedia.wordpress.com   This is the Republican comment to Standard and Poor’s downgrading of the US credit rating, “Unfortunately, decades of reckless spending cannot be reversed immediately, especially when the Democrats who run Washington remain unwilling to make the tough choices required to put America on solid ground,” &gt;&gt; [This statement by Boehner gives the reader the impression that for decades the Democrats have been the spenders] &lt;&lt; Speaker John A. Boehner, an Ohio Republican, said in a statement.” If I remember correctly it was and has been the Republican’s voracious appetite for control of energy resources at whatever means along with it’s global warmongering and it’s questionable relationship with defense contracting and spending; not necessarily because of any overall US policy or interest in pursuing major profits in these areas but as a result of a global energy consortium of conglomerates that wish to take hold and have taken hold of much of this previous decades global oil and gas research and exploration projects-at whatever length.

t5_2qh2b,gerbs,1312868196,"When you sign your two year agreement to get a fancy phone, it says that using your phones data connection in any way other than by direct use of your phone blah blah blah, is a breach of contract.  They can take action against you for breaching contract.  Also, since you broke the terms of the contract, they can choose to cancel it at any time, or charge you, based on what the contract says.  If the contract says that breaching contract results in fees totaling the remaining value of the contract (Lets say you have 13 months left on a 2 year agreement), then they can take you to court and say, this person owes us for the rest of the value of contract because they did things that weren't agreed upon in the contract.  It's all in your 2-year agreement.  No one reads those things, but if your contract says that you can't do those things, then you can't do those things.  If your phone contract says that you can't wear socks with sandals, then sorry, your toes are going to be cold at the beach.  You can probably bring it before a judge and get your contract voided in that case, but that would also mean you would lose phone service.

It looks like a $200 vibrator:-)  Compared to the cost of a new violin, though, almost anything is worth a shot: expensive strings, rosin, shoulder rests that don't dampen the sound.   My only issue with the device as advertised is: ""An initial ToneRite® treatment of 72-144 hours is recommended."" It's just not an option for me.  Also, it seemed that it was advertised on the website not just for new instruments, but also to keep much older instruments sounding great.  In that regard, some free solutions/ideas:  To keep a violin sounding great, Carl Flesh (violin pedagogue of note) recommends cleaning the rosin off of strings everyday and keeping dust out of the body.  ""If used constantly, especially in hot concert halls, one's instrument may develop a 'tired' lackluster quality. In such case it is advisable to reduce the pressure of the strings for a 24 hour period, by tuning them down by and octave or so.  The instrument seems to 'breathe' more freely after that and reward the player with a renewed 'freshness' of tone."" - Art of Violin Playing, book 1",3219,318,0,0,1,1,®

For the first maybe five minutes of conversation, he seemed alright. I can't remember what he did, something vaguely technical, so I told him I'm a tech and I fix computers as my job. It's pretty sweet.  Anyways, then his pitcher of beer comes. I can't really recall whether he turned into this horrid sex-joke spouting neanderthal when this event occurred or if he was already was one, but I remember that the rest of the meal, he wouldn't leave me alone. A friend insisted on snapping lots of photos of us sitting around the table, so he'd lean in and put his hand on mine a couple times. He'd touch my hair, he'd say I smelled nice, he wouldn't shut up about my looks. I tried communicating to people that I was uncomfortable, but no such luck. They were busy having a blast with all the sex jokes and innuendos going around. (Disclaimer: Normally I'd be okay with this, but I was stuck sitting next to a guy *desperately* trying to get into my panties.) At one point during the 'conversation' he proudly declared he was in his ""horny forties"" or something like that. I'm 23.  All the while I also tried the cowardly ""I have another man so back off"" tact: I was texting on my phone most of dinner and kept talking about a guy I was seriously interested in (Boyfriend now ♥). I'd text him things like ""What should I get? Steak or crab?"" to keep the messages incoming and my fingers busy. Any time I looked up from my phone it was to talk about him or something he'd said. Guy was *completely oblivious* to my rampant acts of puppy love and trying to make myself sound unavailable. In hindsight, I should've been a lot more direct.  Finally, I look at the time and OH LOOK IT'S LATE, I have to catch a bus ""before they stop running."" My friends know I live in the middle of nowhere and without a car it's hard to get around. What they're not clear on is that the last bus on a weekend starts it's route at 11pm. It was only eight o'clock or something. I've *had* it with this guy though and I have to bail *immediately*. He asks me for my number and I make up some excuse like ""I don't answer my phone"" or something along those lines. He'd asked me at one point if he could add me to Facebook and did it on his phone immediately, I went home and rejected/blocked him.  I was pretty rude to my friends throughout dinner, but I've talked to them since about how much that guy was bothering me and they seem to understand. Feels bad though :(  **TL;DR:** Horny guy in his forties tries to pick me up at a dinner with friends.",54987,331,0,0,0,1,♥

As much as I'm intrigued by a Quaker who's read Nick Bostrom, I'm going to have to correct that: it's *some* indication that it actually is.

Stross and Vinge were the real influences that turned me on to the harder stuff, like Bostrom.   But it shouldn't be all that intriguing; there are two published sci-fi authors that I know of in our meeting (congregation). In general, actually, Quakers tend to be pretty well-read.  &gt; To argue that it's no indication is logically equivalent to arguing that if the first electron microscopes found little ""© YHVH 4,000BC"" tags on every human cell, that would be zero evidence that our universe is not naturally occurring.  I disagree. It would be absurd to suggest that such a thing came about naturally.

Thank you for sharing, it means a lot to me that someone out there is 'with' me. ♥e-hugs♥  I want to ask you a few questions :)   :  how vivid is your memory of these events?  You describe them in detail, but I am wondering how much of this detail is just words to you.  The reason I ask, is that my ""event"" is a very weak memory, I sometimes doubt my own memory.    have you ever had a feeling or sensation trigger the memory of your abuse?  as I said before I have a very poor memory of the event and a certain sensation can trigger that memory.  So I just wanted to know if you have the same thing.  I have similar psychological and social issues that you have, which seem to be typical of someone who was sexually abused.  Anyways I am just rambling thank you for posting this, it really hit me hard.

I didn't say Atheists support communism. I'm just saying atheists don't speak out against it actively in the way you expect Christians to actively criticize extremist Christians. The strawman argument that all religious people are maliciously enabling right wing wackos is getting old.  And honestly, IMO conservative Christianity isn't very christian at all. Jesus represents ideals that would be criticized as socialism by the christian right.  &gt;every politician in the country must pretend to be a Christian, and do &gt;things he believes the Christians want  it very much disappoints me when people try to gain votes by pretending to be something and flaunting it in public (see Rick Perry's prayer meeting thing). But don't pretend that it is specific to religion or any one religion. I come from an Italian background and my dad wants Rudy Giuliani to be president. I wouldn't vote for the guy but unfortunately people like to identify with candidates in that way.   &gt;Your angry comment makes my point.

Blizzard likes to make their maps ridiculously retarded and abusive and I feel that rather than trying to take idiotic thirds its best to just do a heavy hit off 2 bases. It hits right about 10 minutes, which is usually when terrans are moving out - if you catch them unsieged it's basically GG right there. Not only that, but it sets you up for a third base and a mutalisk transition - this is NOT an allin, but it is a fairly substantial attack.

t5_2qpp6,morphoray,1313474635,"This is really nice, and I really love the idea of using it practice in vs computer games ect, or just learning a build order, but I feel anything beyond that is not appropriate.  As people have mentioned before small things will throw off build orders (even things like walling/building placement) and real games have situations like hatch block/contain/6p/proxygate/rax ect ect ect that will throw a build order out of the window.  For just learning a build order, though, I don't think you guys could have made it any easier or better than this short of adding that sexy voice to YABOT ~♥  Finally, I know this is probably me being more uptight than I probably should be, but I feel this could be considered an ""unfair advantage"" in online play.  It's no different than a sticky note with chicken scrawl on it, but it's still an advantage for some players.  Thankfully it's not even close to as bad as that one coaching program someone made (the one that watched keypresses to see if you were looking at the minimap, macroing, ect).  Overall I'd have to say kudos for making some of the best build order videos I've seen in a long time.  The idea is pretty novel and a great tool for practice at the least.

Get a better routine, get pissed at yourself for constantly getting supply blocked. It will smoothen your play eventually. Just set your aim to look at yourself at 100 games, don't try to look at your last few games because it will feel demotivating. Look what you've achieve for yourself after 100 games or so. It's like when you  diet, you don't want to look at the scale every day but once a week, because a minor setback can result in a huge setback in your head.

With NHL®12’s soundtrack we’re looking to continue this trend through a mix of classic songs and new hits.  “The true NHL experience is about intense skill, hard hits, and fast action,” says Steve Schnur, Worldwide Executive of Music and Marketing for EA.  “For this year’s edition, we’ve created a crunching mix of classic arena anthems from artists like Judas Priest and Billy Idol, killer recent tunes from bands such as Dropkick Murphys and Against Me!, and heavy tracks from emerging acts like Middle Class Rut and Manchester Orchestra. We’re also launching all-new songs from upcoming albums by Anthrax and BUSH. The true sound of the upcoming NHL season is the soundtrack of EA’s NHL ’12.”  Here’s the full list of tracks that will be on NHL®12 in alphabetical order by artist (album in brackets):  Against! Me – Occult Enemies (Russian Spies/Occult Enemies)  Anthrax – I’m Alive (Worship Music)  Beady Eye – Standing on the Edge of the Noise (Different Gear, Still Speeding)  Billy Idol – Mony Mony (The Very Best of Billy Idol)  Black Tide – That Fire (Post Mortem)  Blackguard – Farewell (Firefight)  Bush – Sound of Winter (The Sea of Memories)  Death Letters – I Wish I could Steal a Sunset (Post-Historic)  Dropkick Murphys – Hang ‘em High (Going out in Style)  ELO – Don’t Bring Me Down (Mr. Blue Sky: The Very Best of ELO)  Judas Priest – You’ve Got Another Thing Comin’ (Screaming for Vengeance)  Manchester Orchestra – April Fool (Simple Math)  Middle Class Rut – Busy Being Born (No Name No Color)  Murderdolls – Whatever you got, I’m Against It (Women and Children Last)",6226,1775,0,0,1,1,®

t5_2r2jt,siljak,1313736005,"That depends on who paints it ☺  I charge by materials plus my time, so if it's a portrait done from photos and I can get it done in a day (my usual work), then a 30x30ins canvas would be about US$250. If it's from life or takes two days then it would be more like $500-600. That may seem like a lot, but I work long days so after expenses it works out at about $16 an hour, which is about the average wage where I live, and of course there are also some days when I don't have any commissions.  But I have painter friends who charge a bit less and others who charge a lot more. It's one of those things where your market value depends a lot on what people are prepared to pay for your time, and that isn't always determined by the quality of your work. A lot of painters who aren't technically very good at all can charge a hell of a lot for their stuff just because they (or their gallery) is good at marketing, whilst if you look around for a while you can usually find at least a couple of people who are really talented but are broke and so can be persuaded to work for peanuts.

You see, corruption is a double edged sword: on the one side is draining millions of euros for nothing, on the other side is preventing this money (and people's work and time) from being invested on something important, something that would really create jobs and bring money on the mid-to-long term.   This lack of investment on education, investigation, development, etc is wrecking Spain in the long term. How are we ever going to pay our debt back if we lose all our competitiveness?

t5_2r9vp,tiffums,1314346927,"The first time I did knife hits I was very, very new to smoking; it was approximately my third time getting high, ever. My boyfriend served me the hits, we left immediately after and headed out with a group of 7-8 similarly high/drunk friend to an improv comedy show on campus, just a few blocks away.      So, I take the hit, possibly take two or three. But I'm fine at first after some coughing, because even ice filtered those hits are damned hard on my noobish throat. I grab my coat, feeling a little tingly, and we all head outside. About thirty feet outside our dorm, I start having open-eye visuals so intense that I literally cannot see where I'm walking. The world is moving, shifting, multiplying, and changing color so rapidly that I clutch my boyfriend's arm for dear life. And just as if I were actually blind, he has to tell me when we get to a curb or an obstacle because I'm genuinely incapable of actually processing the sight of what's in front of me.  Time does not mean what it meant just ten minutes ago, and I'm pretty sure whomever determines that this meter is the same distance as that meter has similarly fucked off early for the day.   Walking these six blocks is rapidly becoming the most intense experience of my life. The lights, the many stores and restaurants that are bustling with people are all adding to the intensity of the tingling in my body and the visuals in front of me. A few blocks into the journey I see flashing blue and red and have just enough brainpower left to realize we are going to have to walk past a cop car. I clutch my boyfriend's arm to the point of leaving marks, because at this point I can't even focus my eyes on command, nevertheless converse coherently or try to pass for anything other than being incredibly, ridiculously stoned out of my everloving mind. The only thing right now that I know for certain is that the arm I'm clinging to is real, and that it's keeping me safe... (aside from those few early stumbles when I felt like those IMAX theaters where they drop the camera towards the ground at high speed and even though you're in a theater your brain still thinks you're going to die.) So, fairly safe. And somehow, we pass the cops without incident while I'm distracted by solving the universe.   By now, going up curbs feels like a ski-lift up a mountainside: a cold whooshing as you travel a long way up in a single bound. Going down reminds me of my favorite childhood water slide, and I'm pretty sure I'm even swinging gently from side to side gently as I *whooosh* down the curb, that single step feeling like it's lasting forever.   Eventually, we make it to the auditorium. Either the show is free or someone in the group pays the suggested donation price for me, because I am still incapable of reaching into my pocket to get my wallet. I am incapable of even processing whether or not this is even something I am expected to do.  I do manage the steps into the building on my own though. Or at least, I think I do. The boyfriend-arm is still tightly encircled by both of mine, though, because at this point I'm fairly sure our skins have melded into one entity, and it would hurt a lot to separate them. Besides, I don't want to and you can't make me. I have three arms now. Hah!  We sit down inside, and I am told I spend the next 15 minutes staring at the wall to the right of the stage and laughing softly to myself. They don't understand though, I say, because the wall isn't moving for *them* the way it's moving for *me*.  After another ten minutes I come down enough to actually process and hear snippits of the show, but what's happening inside my head is still better, so I retreat inwards, feeling like a snail withdrawing into a shell made of warm fluffy towels, straight from the dryer but not too hot. It's a nice feeling.   Later we make it back to the dorm, but we could have gotten there by tyrannosaurus-back for all I remember of the rest of the rest of the show and the evening. It was unquestionably, indisputably the highest I have ever been, and almost certainly the highest I will *ever* be.     I wasn't a [10], I wasn't even an [11] (Spinal Tap has nothing on me.) I was a solid [¥®¶].  And I dare any of you to tell me I wasn't tripping balls.   &lt;3  Edit: And I always did feel a special affinity with the (then) boyfriend's right arm after that night.",6536,10,0,0,0,1,®

t5_2qhhk,BALTIM0R0N,1314450261,"From: ""How Stuff Works - How To Treat A Bleeding Dog""   http://animals.howstuffworks.com/pets/how-to-give-first-aid-to-your-dog3.htm  A dog's paws and legs are vulnerable to injury from broken glass, nails, and other sharp objects, and they will bleed heavily when cut. An injured ear will also bleed heavily because the skin over the ear is so thin.  With any bleeding injury, the main purpose of first aid is to prevent excessive blood loss, which can lead to shock. The signs of shock include pale or white gums, a rapid heartbeat, or rapid breathing. If any wound is spurting blood, it means an artery has been cut. This requires immediate professional attention.  How you tend to your dog will depend on the location and extent of the bleeding. The following dog care tips will help you apply first aid to various body areas.  Dog's Bleeding Head or Torso  Step 2 ©2006 Publications International, Ltd. Step 2  Step 1: Restrain the dog if necessary.  Step 1a: Approach the dog slowly, speaking in a reassuring tone of voice.  Step 1b: Slip a leash around the dog's neck, then place the leash around a fixed object. Pull the dog against this object and tie the leash so the dog cannot move its head.  Step 1c: Muzzle the dog to protect yourself.  Step 2: Cover the wound with a sterile gauze pad, clean folded towel, or sanitary napkin.  Step 3: Wrap torn rags or other soft material around the dressing and tie or tape it just tightly enough to hold the bandage in place.  Step 4: Transport the dog immediately to the veterinarian.  Dog's Bleeding Leg, Paw, or Tail  Step 1: Restrain the dog if necessary.  Step 3 ©2006 Publications International, Ltd. Step 3  Step 1a: Approach the dog slowly, speaking in a reassuring tone of voice.  Step 2: Clip the hair around the injured area.  Step 3: Examine the wound for glass or other foreign objects. If visible, remove the object with your fingers or a pair of tweezers. If the tissue under the wound appears to pass by when you move the skin, the wound will probably require stitches.  Step 4: Flush the wound thoroughly with clean water. Avoid home antiseptics, which may cause pain when applied.  Step 5: Cover the wound with a clean cloth, sterile dressing, or sanitary napkin.  Step 6: Place your hand over the dressing and press firmly.  Step 8 ©2006 Publications International, Ltd. Step 8  Step 7: Keep pressure on the dressing to stop bleeding. If blood soaks through the dressing, DO NOT remove it. Apply more dressing and continue to apply pressure until the bleeding stops. If the bleeding does not stop within 5 minutes, continue to apply pressure on the wound while transporting the dog to the veterinarian.  Step 8: Wrap torn rags or other soft material around the dressing and tie or tape it just tightly enough to keep the bandage on. Start below the wound and wrap upward.  Step 9: If the wound is deep enough to require stitches, keep the dog off the injured leg, and immediately transport your pet to the veterinarian.  Dog's Bleeding Chest or Abdomen  Step 1: Restrain the dog if necessary.  Step 1a: Approach the dog slowly, speaking in a reassuring tone of voice.  Step 1b: Muzzle the dog to protect yourself.  Step 2: If the wound is in the chest and a ""sucking"" noise is heard, bandage the wound tightly enough to keep air from entering, and transport the dog immediately to the veterinarian. If not, proceed to Step 3.  Step 3 ©2006 Publications International, Ltd. Step 3  Step 3: If there is a protruding object, such as an arrow, DO NOT attempt to remove the object. If not, proceed to Step 4.  Step 3a: Place clean cloths, sterile dressings, or sanitary napkins around the point of entry.  Step 3b: Bandage tightly around the point of entry.  Step 3c: Transport the dog immediately to the veterinarian.  Step 4: Clip the hair around the injured area.  Step 5: Examine the wound for glass or other foreign objects. If visible, remove the object with your fingers or a pair of tweezers. If the tissue under the wound appears to pass by when you move the skin, the wound will probably require stitches.  Step 6: Flush the wound thoroughly with clean water.  Step 7: Cover the wound with a clean cloth, sterile dressing, or sanitary napkin.  Step 10 ©2006 Publications International, Ltd. Step 10  Step 8: Place your hand over the dressing and press firmly.  Step 9: Keep pressure on the dressing to stop the bleeding. If blood soaks through the dressing, DO NOT remove it. Apply more dressing and continue to apply pressure until the bleeding stops.  Step 10: Wrap torn sheets or other soft material around the dressing and tie or tape it just tightly enough to keep the bandage on.  Step 11: If the wound is deep enough to require stitches, transport the dog immediately to the veterinarian.  Dog's Bleeding Ear  Step 1: Restrain the dog if necessary.  Step 2 ©2006 Publications International, Ltd. Step 2  Step 1a: Approach the dog slowly, speaking in a reassuring tone of voice.  Step 1b: Muzzle the dog to protect yourself.  Step 2: Cover the wound with a clean cloth, sterile dressing, or sanitary napkin. Place dressing material on both sides of the ear flap, then fold it over the top of the dog's head and hold firmly to control bleeding.  Step 3: Wrap torn sheets or rags around the dressing, ear, and head, making sure the entire ear is covered. Tape or tie the bandage in place.  Step 4: Transport the dog immediately to the veterinarian.  Dog's Bleeding Nails  A broken nail or one that is cut too short are the most common reasons for a bleeding nail. Be sure to bring your dog to the groomer if you're not comfortable clipping its nails.  If the nail is broken:  Step 1: Restrain the dog if necessary.  Step 1a: Approach the dog slowly, speaking in a reassuring tone of voice.  Step 3 ©2006 Publications International, Ltd. Step 3  Step 2: DO NOT try to cut or remove the broken nail without muzzling the dog.  Step 3: Hold a clean cloth, sterile dressing, or sanitary napkin against the nail. The bleeding will stop in a few minutes.  Step 4: Transport the dog to the veterinarian as soon as possible.  If the nail is cut too short:  Step 1: Restrain the dog if necessary.  Step 1a: Approach the dog slowly, speaking in a reassuring tone of voice.  Step 1b: Slip a leash around the dog's neck, then place the leash around a fixed object. Pull the dog against this object and tie the leash so the dog cannot move its head.  Step 1c: Muzzle the dog to protect yourself.  Step 2: Hold a clean cloth, sterile dressing, or sanitary napkin against the nail.  Step 3: Keep firm pressure on the area for at least 5 minutes. DO NOT remove the bandage until the bleeding stops.  Step 4: If the bleeding does not stop in 15 to 20 minutes, transport the dog to the veterinarian as soon as possible. Continuous bleeding indicates a bleeding disorder that should be treated promptly.  Internal Bleeding  Internal bleeding is always an emergency. The signs of internal bleeding are pale or white gums; rapid heartbeat or breathing; and bleeding from the ears, nose, mouth, or rectum. The following steps will help you treat the dog for any potential shock, and transport the dog to professional help immediately.  Step 1: If there is bleeding from any external wounds, treat for shock.  Step 1a: Examine the gums by gently lifting the upper lip so the gum is visible. Pale or white gums indicate the dog is almost certainly in shock and may have serious internal injuries and/or bleeding. If the gums are pink, the dog is probably not in shock.  Step 1b: Determine the heartbeat. Place your fingers firmly on the dog about 2 inches behind the dog's elbow in the center of its chest. Count the number of beats in 10 seconds and multiply by 6. If the dog is in shock its heartbeat may be more than 150 beats per minute.  Step 3 ©2006 Publications International, Ltd. Step 3  Step 2: Place the dog on its side with its head extended.  Step 3: Gently pull out the dog's tongue to keep the airway open.  Step 4: Elevate the dog's hindquarters slightly by placing them on a pillow or folded towels.  Step 5: To conserve body heat, wrap the dog in a blanket or jacket.  Step 6: Transport the dog immediately to the veterinarian.",102641,13090,0,0,0,1,©

Now what's the common link? The   &gt;  deliberate and systematic extermination of a national, racial, political, or cultural group.      Nothing close to that is happening in Israel (as much as ggbesq would like to have you believe it, given that he's part of the supposedly oppressed group and has been known for inciting baseless conspiracy theories here on reddit). In fact, the relative proportion of the population of Arabs/Muslims/{whatever else ethnic group you think is being culled} is *rising* in Israel proper compared to most other segments (for the record, the main group surpassing them are the Orthodox Jews, which most Israelis hate.) Populations in Gaza/{West Bank} are also sharply on the rise. (Who'd have thought that a country which almost surely has nukes would be so bad at exterminating people that they do it at a negative rate?)      &gt; BUT MAYBE THEY'RE JUST DOING IT SLOWLY SO THE REST OF THE WORLD DOESN'T NOTICE LOL?      Good question (though it wasn't really a question), but if you consider the militant/civilian casualty ratio of the operations in Gaza, you'd notice that Israeli military strikes are collectively among the most precise set of operations that *any* country has ever accomplished in the history of modern Guerilla warfare (unfortunately for the militants, actually, as they actively hide among the population in hopes of having their fellow Gazans killed for the sake of PR).

The entire list is below:  &gt; Automatic headlights, Xenon HID headlights, Navigation system with 6.5"" touchscreen &amp; XM NavTraffic® (90-day trial), cruise control, Leather seating surfaces with Power Driver Seat &amp; Heated front seats, rear spoiler, the upgraded sound system (600-watt Infinity® AM/FM/XM®/CD/MP3 audio system with 10 speakers), Automatic temperature control, Electrochromic auto-dimming rearview mirror with compass, HomeLink® integrated transceiver, Heated outside mirrors with turn signal indicators, Power tilt-and-slide glass sunroof, Metalgrain and chrome interior accents, Backup warning system, Chrome front fascia accents, Aluminum pedals, Aero wiper blades or Premium door sill plates  Unlike the Mustang standard vs Premium where there are major differences (suspension, brakes, 19-inch wheels with summer Pirellis, front strut tower brace).  And even if you want to compare the Track model:  &gt; Want a richer ambiance and equipment on par with that in our Genesis tester? You'll need to throw down $3700 for the Premium Package (leather, Bluetooth, satellite radio), $2340 for the Electronics Package (navigation and auto climate control), $595 for heated seats, and $525 for Xenon headlamps. Total? $32,545, or $1075 more than the Hyundai's sticker.  So pricing-wise they're pretty much on par.  And finally an actual link to the Motortrend test: [3.8L Genesis v. V6 Premium Mustang (and others)](http://www.motortrend.com/roadtests/coupes/1004_2011_mustang_v6_vs_2010_genesis_coupe_3_8_vs_2010_camaro_rs_vs_2010_challenger_se/viewall.html) - Genesis comes out on top overall.

t5_2sokd,Ginnigan,1314717201,"Some things I try to keep in mind:  * Don't clutter the desktop with shortcuts and documents (this goes for ANY computer.)  * Every so often backup unused files to an external harddrive and remove them from your computer. A full hard drive is a slow hard drive. You can burn the files to CDs or DVDs, too, if you don't have an external hard drive.  * Keep the software updated. You can click on the little Apple logo in the top left corner, then click ""Software Update..."" and it will check if there is an update for you. It will also check automatically every so often, just in case you forget :)  * Don't forget to close programs when you are not using them. On Macs pressing the red X won't close the whole program. Any program on your dock (bottom bar) with a blue dot under it is open. Right-click the icon and click ""Close"" to fully close it.  Having a lot of programs open at once can slow down your computer.  * Like MySuperLove said, try not to overheat your laptop. Macs can get VERY warm, so try to only use them on a hard surface (like a table or a desk.) You *can* use it on your bed, but it will get very hot and it's not good for it. I bought a [lap-desk](http://www.walmart.com/ip/LapGear-Auburn-Tigers-Lap-Desk/16904515) so that I could use it on my lap or my bed without worrying about it.  * Keep an eye on the battery. If within the first year the battery is not lasting as long as it used to, or it is actually bulging (mine did this...) take it back to Apple/the store you bought it and they will replace it for you. This goes for any problem you have with the computer within the first year. As long as the damage wasn't caused by you (say, if you spilled water on it, or dropped it, or left it in a car overnight in the winter), Apple will fix it. If you can't get to the store you can submit your problem online at [Apple's website](http://www.apple.com/support/contact/).  * Like hurbaga said, be careful what you download. Most computer viruses out there are out to attack Windows PCs, but as Macs become more popular, so will viruses that are out to attack Macs. Viruses are bad! You do not want them, so be careful of downloads and know what you're getting.  If I think of more I'll add onto this, or make another comment :) Hope you enjoy your Mac!

t5_6,dementiatoday,1314737865,"**What is Dementia?**  Dementia is not a specific disease; it is a collection of symptoms that can be caused by a number of disorders, including neurodegenerative disease. The term “dementia” describes a progressive decline in memory or other cognitive functions that interferes in the ability to perform your usual daily activities (driving, shopping, balancing a checkbook, working, communicating, etc.).   The deterioration is more than might be expected from normal aging and is due to damage or disease. While dementia often includes memory loss, memory loss by itself does not mean that you have dementia.  Dementia is caused by various diseases and conditions that result in damaged brain cells or connections between brain cells. When making a diagnosis of dementia, physicians commonly refer to the criteria given in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV).  To meet DSM-IV criteria for dementia, the following are required:  Symptoms must include decline in memory and in at least one of the following cognitive abilities:  * Ability to generate coherent speech or understand spoken or written language; * Ability to recognize or identify objects, assuming intact sensory function; * Ability to execute motor activities, assuming intact motor abilities, sensory function and comprehension of the required task * Ability to think abstractly, make sound judgments and plan and carry out complex tasks.  The decline in cognitive abilities must be severe enough to interfere with daily life.  **How Common Is Dementia?**  Approximately 3.4 million individuals aged 71 and older in the United States have dementia (reference), and an estimated 5.3 million Americans of all ages have Alzheimer’s disease (reference). While a number of different diseases can cause dementia, Alzheimer’s disease is the most common cause in older adults.   Some other diseases that cause dementia include frontotemporal dementia, stroke (vascular dementia) and dementia with Lewy bodies. For people who are age 65 and older with a degenerative dementia, the most common disorders are Alzheimer’s disease and vascular dementia. In people who are under 65, frontotemporal dementia and Huntington’s disease are also common. The damage caused by each of these diseases creates a typical pattern of cognitive loss due to the areas of the brain impacted by the underlying disease.  Dementia caused by nervous system disease, especially Alzheimer’s disease, is increasing in frequency more than most other types of dementia. Some researchers suspect that as many as half of all people over 80 years old develop Alzheimer’s disease. Also, the increased incidence of AIDS dementia complex, which results from HIV infection, helps account for the increased dementia in recent history, although with the invention of newer and better drugs to treat HIV, the occurrence of AIDS-associated dementia is declining.    Researchers have also found that two nervous diseases, which were originally incorrectly diagnosed as Alzheimer’s, are emerging as major causes of dementia: Lewy body disease and Pick’s disease.  **Who Gets Dementia?**  Dementia is considered a late-life disease because it tends to develop mostly in elderly people. About 5% to 8% of all people over the age of 65 have some form of dementia, and this number doubles every five years above that age. It is estimated that as many as half of people in their 80s suffer from dementia.   Some cases of dementia are caused by medical conditions that can be treated, fully or partly restoring mental function. When dementia cannot be reversed, the goal of treatment is to make life as easy as possible for the person and the caregivers.  **Which Dementias Are Treatable?**  It is important for a physician to determine the cause of memory loss or other dementia-like symptoms. Some symptoms can be reversed if they are caused by treatable conditions, such as depression, delirium, drug interaction, thyroid problems, excess use of alcohol or certain vitamin deficiencies.  * Dementia due to long-term substance abuse. * Tumors that can be removed. * Subdural hematoma, accumulation of blood beneath the outer covering of the brain is the result of a broken blood vessel, usually the result of a head injury. * Normal-pressure hydrocephalus. * Metabolic disorders, such as a vitamin B12 deficiency. * Hypothyroidism, a condition that results from an underactive thyroid. * Hypoglycemia, a condition that results from low blood sugar.  **What Are Some of the Untreatable Causes of Dementia?**  When dementia is not caused by treatable conditions, a physician must conduct further assessments to identify the form of dementia that is causing symptoms. Different types of dementia are associated with distinct symptom patterns and distinguishing microscopic brain abnormalities.  * Alzheimer’s disease. * Multi-infarct dementia (Dementia due to multiple small strokes). * Dementias associated with Parkinson’s disease and similar disorders. * AIDS dementia complex. * Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a quickly progressing and fatal disease that consists of dementia and muscle twitching and spasm.  **Citation**  WebMD Medical Reference from Healthwise Last Updated: June 17, 2009 This information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor.

t5_2qh1i,highguy420,1314762149,"Fair enough, in your mind it is a faulty comparison.  I'm glad you shared.  My dad works at monsanto and says that GM crops are superior to the way nature has done things for thousands of years despite evidence to the contrary.  Your ""dad"" as you put it, is ignoring the obvious facts, or has not done the research himself and is trusting a biased opinion.  I'm guessing he is not a cannabis researcher for the Mayo Clinic.  The researchers that actually do study this have shown that THC, including the synthetic substance included in dronobanol (Marinol®), by itself is not as effective as the complete plant, or a more complete extract including multiple cannabinoids.  He would know that if he actually ever researched it.  But he hasn't, and, like the rest of us, is suffering from confirmation bias.  Let me ask my mechanic what he thinks of zero-clearance hinges for my kitchen remodel... it's all mechanical shit anyway, cars are no different than cabinets.  The statement is about ability, not alacrity.  If you can sink 60 free-throws in a row, without missing once, in one minute sober, and it takes 61 seconds to do high, you still just sank 60 free-throws in a row.  Sure, it took you, on average, a bit longer, but your ability to do 60 free throws in a row was not inhibited.  The report that comes from is in relationship to driving in a simulator, so I think the scientists would have said something more direct if the amount of time was significant enough to actually affect driving safety ... as that was the entire purpose of the study.  So now we are going to argue the definition of ""success""?  Hah.  Good one.    I understand that you want to understand my perspective, but you have to realize that you have grown up in a society where everyone around you has been told lies for so long they actually believe them.  You grew up in a society that had already been indoctrinated for over twenty years to believe that cannabis, one of the safest and most beneficial plants known to humans, is somehow able to destroy society, let alone a person's life.    The only thing that the prohibition of cannabis, or any drug for that matter, accomplishes is to allow the government to control our personal choices.  That is it.  It does not protect society.  It does not protect a drug addict from themselves, it does NOTHING but undermine our freedom from the prying eyes and violent intervention of the government.    There is no reason a plant should be illegal.  End of story.  If someone uses that plant to hurt someone that action should be illegal.  If I extract cyanide from apple seeds and kill someone then that would be called murder.  If I extract cocaine from coca leaves and ingest it the only harmed party is myself.  If I then kill someone on a ""drug induced psychotic episode"" then that would be murder.  Punishing someone for possession or use of any psychoactive substance is preemptive punishment.   To try and prohibit every single harmful substance is a laughable goal. What about pencils?  Bicycles?  Swimming pools?  When will it be actually illegal to run with scissors?  Each of those things kill more people daily than marijuana has killed in the entire time since the first mammal discovered that the plant produces chemicals that activate some receptors in their brain, let alone the first human being cultivated the cannabis plant for spiritual, medicinal or recreational use.   I'm not saying that there should not be assistance available if someone wants to quit using it, just like there should be assistance available to someone who wants to quit any life-altering habit, such as overeating, uncontrolled sexual urges, pokemon, biting your nails, etc.  If a habit is harmful to you, or those around you, and you want to find help, then you should be able to find help for that problem.  The point is that it is not a matter for the courts.  If your family, your friends, and especially if you find that any habit, drugs or otherwise, is causing negative life consequences then that is a matter for your family, friends and most importantly yourself to address.  There is no reason, short of you committing actual crimes, that the court should be involved in your personal affairs.  It is a waste of resources, plain and simple.  So, the issue is not so much a matter of cannabis being a harmless plant, which it is as much as ebay.com or eclairs are ""not a danger to society"", instead it is a matter of the entire concept of prohibiting it being absurd and contrary to the foundational concepts upon which this country was built.  The thing that makes cannabis dangerous is the prohibition.  Remove prohibition and you will find that cannabis is safe and beneficial to society in many, many ways.  Anyone who tells you otherwise wants your money, your freedom or both.   edit: found a few typos, should have proofread. ",36749,1359,0,0,1,1,®

t5_2qmvj,yorugua,1314819603,"Del Observador:      © El Observador  El fiscal Diego Pérez pidió a la Justicia el procesamiento con prisión del ex intendente Mariano Arana, de la ex secretaria general de la comuna María Julia Muñoz y del ex director municipal Alberto Rosselli. Luego de dos años de investigación que incluyó el testimonio de 60 personas y ocho careos, el magistrado concluyó que los ex jerarcas fueron responsables de dos de los tres delitos que le imputó a Juan Carlos Bengoa y que terminaron con el director de Casinos tras las rejas: delito continuado de fraude y de concusión. También solicitó a la jueza Fanny Canessa que se los procese por un delito continuado de abuso de funciones.  A juicio del fiscal, los superiores a  Bengoa, a pesar de su intento por negarlo, estaban al tanto de las maniobras llevadas adelante por el responsable de los casinos municipales.  Por este caso también fueron procesados en diciembre de 2007 los ex asesores de Bengoa, Orestes González y José Luis Antúnez, el ex funcionario municipal Gustavo Dalmonte y el empresario Felipe Ruiz. Fundamentalmente la Justicia los responsabilizó por el cambio de estrategia de negocios por la que se pasó de comprar a arrendar máquinas tragamonedas para los casinos municipales, con pérdidas millonarias para la Intendencia y ganancias para los empresarios.  Además, todas las empresas que pusieron US$ 270 mil para la refacción de obras en el Casino Parque Hotel resultaron seleccionadas por la IMM para arrendar directamente slots.  Fraude y concusión A juicio del fiscal Pérez, resultó clave para pedir coautoría de estos delitos una nota que figura en el expediente de agosto de 2002, en la que Bengoa informa a sus jerarcas de la nueva estrategia de negocios basada en el arrendamiento de tragamonedas.  Si bien los ex jerarcas municipales aseguraron que nada sabían de las decisiones tomadas por Bengoa, a juicio de la Fiscalía esa nota confirma que conocían la maniobra, y que cooperaron con ella en perjuicio de la administración. En esa nota, Bengoa también menciona la refacción del Casino Parque Hotel y la licitación que se llevaría a cabo posteriormente. De ahí devendría, a juicio del fiscal, la coautoría del delito de concusión. El fiscal entendió que los jerarcas favorecieron la estrategia por la cual quienes pusieron dinero en la “colecta” para las obras del Parque Hotel luego salieron beneficiados con la contratación directa.  A lo largo de la indagatoria judicial, Arana, Muñoz y Rosselli insistieron en que desconocían las obras. Arana declaró en marzo de 2009 –en el careo con Bengoa– que se enteró de las obras poco antes de la inauguración y que desconocía que se hubieran llevado a cabo con la colaboración de los empresarios. Además, definió esa obra como “minúscula” con relación a otras y que por lo tanto no se trató en las reuniones que el intendente mantiene con sus directores.  Abuso de funciones El fiscal Pérez quiere que se los procese, es decir, que se los investigue por un nuevo presunto delito: abuso de funciones. Pérez entiende que hay dos resoluciones adoptadas por Arana, con participación de Muñoz y Rosselli, que confirman  que ordenaron actos arbitrarios en perjuicio de la IMM. La primera es la adjudicación de dos máquinas marca Sigma Japón con una ganancia del 50% para el empresario Carlos Mautone, titular de esas máquinas. Mautone fue el único empresario que no puso dinero para la colecta.  Según el fiscal, quedó probado que Bengoa no tuvo participación en la asignación de esas máquinas. La resolución fue firmada por Muñoz. Luego se supo que Mautone se reunió con Arana y el intendente le ofreció esa ganancia.  Esa resolución de diciembre de 2001 lleva también la firma de Rosselli. En ese momento Bengoa no había asumido la responsabilidad de los casinos, cargo que desempeñó a partir de 2002.  La Fiscalía señaló como parte del abuso de funciones la decisión de la IMM de aumentar las ganancias al Hotel Oceanía en 10%, que debían ser entregadas a Carmitel.  Durante el careo con Muñoz, Bengoa declaró que la IMM negoció con Carmitel para que retirara el recurso que presentó contra la instalación de la sala de juegos en el Oceanía. Bengoa, acompañado del secretario de Arana, Mario Areán, negoció ese incremento con el titular del Oceanía, Everly Rodríguez. Según Bengoa, lo hicieron a pedido de Arana, pero éste lo negó.",12671,6849,0,0,0,0,©
