Your jaded approach is a wise one, and further, you are right to mistrust the enormous media machine whose shadow knows no boundaries. The same script is given to most if not all outlets, be they 'alternative' or not. Regarding the wars, the first casualty is truth, whether or not the wars were actually declared. Truth in media, *any* media is virtually non-existent. Sources who talk about sensitive contemporary issues (War on Terror™, terrorism, the 'death' of bin Laden, etc.) all read off the same script. You as the citizen are meant to believe a certain way and they will tell you how to do that. Anyone who questions this is a 'conspiracy theorist' or a 'truther'. We love our labels in this country, especially when they defy status quo, leaving the door open for the hypnotized masses to go from pointing the finger at dissenters to feeding from the tittie of Faux News and being none the wiser. The trick is to recognize the lull of the Drone Army and keep your ears out of its frequency.  ",™

I remember saying something like ""I'll try anything once"" or whatever. So we went out on the back-side porch, myself and the two girls smoked but the friend I came with didn't(even though he smoked all the time back then, which made no sense to me. but then again he was a douche and liked being the sober one to take advantage of whoever wasn't). I remember totally failing at lighting the bowl and at one point shotgunning a hit from one of the girls. It was pretty relaxed and peaceful. The next day I hit up the one girl to chill, we did, and of course we smoked. And its been like that ever since, except those people aren't my friends anymore haha*  *wish the girls were still, they were great frients while they lasted   tips:     1. don't tip the lighter too much while trying to burn the herb, you will just burn your flesh     2. inhale at a steady pace, not too fast or you will torch the whole bowl and not too slow cause you wont get a hit at all     3. learn to corner, everyone likes an ent who corners (:  Enjoy your journey down the green path ☮",☮

We are french, and last time I checked, french ≠ english. So we are different. We expect different things from Society and Civilization than you blokes do.  So, no matter what, there are (many) things the english will find annoying about the french. And, don’t worry, there are many things we, the frogs, find annoying about the english. Like that numbskully retarded omnibus crime bill, which goes against our very notions of Civilization.  Our Society does not revolve around biblical retribution. We have dumped that religious “morals” bullshit 50 years ago, so we view anything that purports to be “biblical” as being both retarded AND annoying. And even then when we were smothered under that heavy, suffocathing scatholic moral, we weren’t as retarded as the Canadian Reform Alliance Party wants to be, as scatholics follow the new testament as opposed to the utterly retarded bronze-age old testament that is worshipped by protestants of the ilk that vote for the Canadian Reform Alliance Party.  So, though the wholly united voice of our **FEDERALIST** government of Québec, we are saying that the federal omnibus crime bill is pretty much the textbook definition of goddamned fucking annoying.  &gt; If there's a way to be divisive, it does it.  Good!

t5_2qm4e,visutton,1320215321,"Chapter 5, Venusian at Heart by Victoria Sutton © 2011  	Georgian was always right there in her laboratory, right when she didn’t need him.  She was in the middle of a gene isolation experiment, and couldn’t be interrupted.  She needed to get this finished in time to give the human subjects the gene therapy treatment, so that she could time their ordered termination, for a full moon.  That way, they could have some light on their way to the Everglades.  Janis thought how lucky she was that no one had perfected the ability to read thoughts, or she would be headed for the death penalty.   That’s exactly what crossed her mind when Georgian entered her laboratory.  He was much too interested, and should not be in her laboratory.  He had something up his sleeve.  She could tell by the look on his face. “Janis,” Georgian called her name and she had to look up from her work. “Oh hi, Georgian,” Janis said casually and continued to work. 	“I am bringing the investigators to talk to you about the human subject escape,” Georgian said with stern seriousness, “and they want to talk to you about where the escape route could be.  I told them that you knew this laboratory and the human subject pod better than anyone else.” 	“Sure, I am happy to talk to them,” Janis said, having done this several times before for each of her carefully orchestrated escapes.  She had always thrown them off track enough that they never came close to discovering her escape route. 	“They have some idea that you may be their insider suspect who is planning the escape, but I told them that was nonsense.  You were up for the promotion to head the gene design exploration project, and you had much better things to do with your time.” 	Janis laughed a nervous laugh, try as she would not to sound so nervous. 	“Exactly.  I am quite excited about the possibility of heading the Gene Design Exploration project,” Janis managed to get out a sentence that didn’t sound nervous or flustered.  She needed to sound perfectly confident.  She didn’t need to add to any suspicion he might have.  	“Well, just a heads up that you can expect them any time, and I know you will take care of their concerns,” Georgian sounded satisfied.  He turned to go as he finished his sentence like he usually did.  Then he turned back around at the doorway, which he usually did not do. 	“Oh, and one more thing.  Make sure that Ali has everything she needs to do her work,” Georgian added. 	He really didn’t need to add that, Janis thought, but she nodded dutifully toward Georgian as he continued out of her doorway and down the hall. As promised, the investigators show up at Janis’s laboratory within the hour.  She begins to shut down her experiment because she knows this will take at least an hour and blow the rest of her productive day in the laboratory.   “Janis69?”  the investigator asked, and when Janis replied in the affirmative, sticking her tongue out for the optical DNA scan to confirm her identity, scanning her DNA that sat ready for the viewing on her tongue.  Then in a millisecond it linked to her employment identification and position  in Progenitor. “Research scientist, Director of the Gene Laboratory,” it read. And your creds?” Janis replied in return, knowing that she needed to affirm their identity as well.  They complied by showing her their pocket reader scans of their DNA linked to their position in Progenitor.    “Janis, we are here to just ask you a few questions, and I know that you have done this before, so we have only a couple of things to ask,” the guy with a scar over his eyebrow responded. “How much laboratory space do you have here?” Janis thought that an odd question for an criminal investigator but responded, “20,000 square feet.” “And how many portable pods do you have with your work in storage?”  Again, Janis thought this an odd question, and responded, “twenty-seven.” “Very good,” the investigator looked satisfied, “we can effect your transfer immediately and transfer your pods to the laboratory in the East quad while we continue the investigation.” Janis heart sank.  They couldn’t move her from her laboratory!  That was her area, and they had no right to take her space and just haul her into another quad!  And the human subjects.  She would not be able to carry out her next escape plan, and they would soon learn that the one person who was no longer here was responsible when no other escapes occurred!  That must be their plan. “I find this highly irregular,” Janis said without emotion, “I need to stay in my space.  I have a limited amount of time, and we are in the middle of accelerating our project to finish with our human subjects.” “That has all been taken care of.  You can continue with your research, but your laboratory will be under the supervision of …. Let’s see here, yes, Ali51 will be the temporary laboratory director while you are in your temporary space,” the scar on his forehead twitched as he spoke. ",©

t5_2qm4e,visutton,1320216041,"continued . . . Chapter 5, Venusian at Heart by Victoria Sutton© 2011  “It is only a temporary arrangement to clear you of any suspicion,” the second investigator added, who up until this point had been decidedly quiet. “You can gather your things and you have two hours, before the movers will transport you to the East quad,” the first investigator added, “and please touch the pad to signify that you understand what we are doing and that this is not an admission of guilt.” “Sure,” Janis replied trying not to show the panic that was cursing through her body at this very moment.  She dearly hoped that no one noticed her deep fear that she would be discovered.  But what is worse, the human subjects will be ordered to termination and she would be absolutely powerless to help them. “Good day,” they hardly smiled and Janis thought it just as well, relieving her of the obligation to smile back. While Janis was reeling from the new chaos that was her life, now Georgian walked into her doorway.  That man always managed to appear at the most unfortunate times. “Janis, I am sorry we have to move you,” Georgian said, and he hardly knew how to say the words ‘I am sorry’ so Janis was a bit worried. “Are you crazy making Ali the head of this lab?” Janis said to Georgian, “you know she is a security risk and has a terminator gene!” “Yes, I know Janis, that is what you say, but we need to clear your name.  The rumors that you are the insider responsible for the escapes are creating a morale problem, and it is also going to affect my ability to promote you to the laboratory director position that you want.” “Are you kidding me?” Janis was incredulous, “over some silly rumors?” “Fewer rumors have sunk more than one ship, Janis,” Georgian remarked in his usual cold way, then added, “we also believe that there is a corporate spy that may have infiltrated Progenitor, and we want to isolate them.  We have found irregularities in the entries and searches in the bioinformatics databases.” Janis is immediately suspicious of Ali but holds back from pointing this out to Georgian.  Janis thought surely he hadn’t been completely blinded by her beauty, too?   “How long is this temporary transfer?” Janis wanted a direct answer. “I don’t know, but probably for maybe three weeks,” Georgian said knowing more than he was telling her. “That is too long!  This is going to slow down my research and the replication we need for the gene to get the conception insertion rate higher, and you know this!” Janis knew she was beginning to sound exasperated.  “It‘s a deal that is closed, Janis.  I’ll check in with you in the East quad later today,” Georgian said, as he turned and disappeared quickly out of her doorway.  There was no more to be said. Janis had two hours, and she needed to get to find the gene that Ali was searching, the one that she was replicating that had origins in Venus bacteria.  This just doesn’t make sense, and she would not dare tell Georgian because then they would all just dismiss her and conclude that she was jealous of Ali. She had to find real proof. Janis went to the classified database with the access code for her laboratory which Ali had already entered.  As she watched the codes spinning like an old slot machine on her wallscreen, she watched for the gene’s code to appear.  When the spinning stopped, she hit the jackpot.  There was the gene and the information she wanted to search. “Hi Janis!” Magellan lumbered into the laboratory, like he was floating on a cloud.  Janis thought he was the last thing she needed just now. “Magellan, I don’t have time to hear about your lunch with Ali, right now, I have two hours before I am being transferred to the East quad,” Janis talked without removing her gaze from the wallscreen. “What?  The East quad?  That’s the Siberia of Progenitor.  What is going on?” Magellan said. “You know perfectly well what is going on,” Janis said, still not looking away from the wallscreen, “they are trying to find the insider they believe is pulling the escapes of the human subjects.” “So it is just a temporary move, and after the next escape you will be back,” Magellan said trying to cheer his friend, while a worried look crossed his face. Janis stops talking, and just looks quietly at the wallscreen, then turns it off. “Let me know if I can help,” Magellan said as he turned to go. “Yeah, I will let you know,” Janis said quietly. She had just discovered that the gene Ali had isolated and identified for insertion in every baby born in America was not only the CO2 tolerant gene, but another gene in the same sequence that would go quietly undetected in the insertion along with the CO2 gene.  It originated on Venus, too.  It was the terminator gene. ",©

t5_2r2jt,sltkr,1320229942,"&gt; ""Nice Guys"" aren't the same thing as genuinely kind and friendly men, and are actually just assholes with a veneer of niceness.  That distinction is artificial and inappropriately equates nice guys with Nice Guys™. Many people are genuinely nice without malicious intent. Your definition is somewhat popular on 2XC, however, because it allows women to reclassify nice people as assholes based on whether or not they are attracted to them, which is obviously fallacious.  To understand why this is comforting, you should realize that the idea that it is good to be nice, and that people will like you (personally as well as romantically) when you are nice, is pervasive in society and shared by men and women alike. But in reality, women are attracted to a variety of traits, sometimes including but certainly not limited to niceness.  As a result, women regularly pass over nice people in favour of others who act less nice but they are more attracted to for other reasons. I don't think this is wrong, but those women may still feel like a bad person for doing so. After all, doesn't society say she should strive to be with nice people? Isn't that what she always said she wanted?  The idea that the nice guy was actually an asshole in disguise is then very comforting, because it allows her to reconcile the contradictory notions that this guy she rejected was nice to her with her belief that she is attracted to nice people: if she wasn't attracted to him, he must have secretly been an asshole. Perfect!  That notion isn't helpful at all. What *is* helpful is for men and women to realize that attraction isn't based on niceness alone and that it's harmful to tell people it should be. It leads to misguided ideas about love for both men and women.",™

Is that saying that Legal Momentum = ""NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund""?  Or only in 1970?  Because I thought VAWA was passed in 1994?  So far you have a couple random lines that suggest that a feminist organization called Legal Momentum was funded as a subdivision of NOW in 1970.  &gt;1. An agreement to perform together an illegal, wrongful, or subversive act. 2. A group of conspirators.  Where did you get this definition?  Why do you feel it is more valid than the one I used?  Secrecy is a generally accepted element of conspiracies.  Pick a conspiracy-- JFK, Jimmy Hoffa, 9/11, going to the moon-- they were all alleged to have been planned and carried out secretly.

Nambudripad's Allergy Elimination Techniques, also known as NAET®, are a non-invasive, drug free, natural solution to eliminate allergies of all types and intensities using a blend of selective energy balancing, testing and treatment procedures from acupuncture/acupressure, allopathy, chiropractic, nutritional, and kinesiological disciplines of medicine. One allergen is treated at a time. If you are not severely immune deficient, you may need just one treatment to desensitize one allergen. A person with mild to moderate amount of allergies may take about 15-20 office visits to desensitize 15-20 food and environmental allergens. Basic essential nutrients are treated during the first few visits. Chemicals, environmental allergens, vaccinations, immunizations, etc. are treated after completing about ten basic essential nutrients. NAET® can successfully eliminate adverse reactions to egg, milk, peanuts, penicillin, aspirin, mushrooms, shellfish, latex, grass, ragweed, flowers, perfume, animal dander, animal epithelial, make-up, chemicals, cigarette smoke, pathogens, heat, cold, other environmental agents. It may take several office visits to desensitize a severe allergen.NAET® was discovered by Dr. Devi S. Nambudripad in November of 1983. ",®

t5_2cneq,sheasie,1320293466,"I hate to criticize your point (it's a fair point), and I agree that the global war on terror has all but gutted America's coffers (not to mention its moral high-ground).  That said... please consider this:  **technology**.  Technology is out-pacing man-kind's ability to manage it safely  To make a point, a small vile of a deadly bio-toxin - placed stragically on a manhattan subway train, could essentially lead to the disintegration of modern society (taking-down billions of people in the process).  **The simple fact is ""the war on terror"" is more legitimately about ""prevention""** than ""revenge"".    Yes, the American people ""authorized it"" out of revenge.  But the leaders of the country were pushing for it as a matter of prevention.  (The leaders didn't care why Americans approved it, so long as they did.  And by leaving the propaganda of 9/11 for another discussion, I am by no means suggesting that I agree with ""the ends justifies the means"" mentality.  We live hear, now and in the present moment.  We do not live at ""the end"".  On a graph, we live the actual data points -- we do not live the trend, which can suggest stability when, in fact, we are living nothing but spikes.)  In any event, the point is simple:  To judge the success of the war on terror by calculating the cost per American death as a result of terrorism over the past decade is interesting if you buy into the myth that ""the war on terror"" is about revenge.  It's not.  It's about the future and prevention.  It will only be quantifiable in 200 years once we can see that modern civilization has not collapsed due to a technologically-enabled terrorist strike by a very small group of extremists.  And yes, here's what makes the argument so dangerous:  1.  It's an entirely valid argument; but 2.  **There is no accountability** (because the only measure of success is when modern civilization **  *doesn't* ** collapse).  So getting back to your point... yes, it has been a complete waste.   The War on Terror™ is the ultimate con game.

t5_2cneq,robkinyon,1320343590,"I'm not disagreeing with your assertion that fluoridated water is a ""Bad Idea""™. I'm probing to determine exactly *why* you think this is the case, primarily by attempting to apply the logic I think you're using to other scenarios and seeing what your response is.  &gt; That means that our water (H20) should at most include . . . any necessary additives in minimal quantities that kill organisms in amounts not found in clean fresh water.  &gt; Since you don't find fluoride in natural/fresh water systems (brooks, rivers, lakes, springs, etc..) then adding it becomes a medicinal endeavor rather than one of safety.  The notion of ""clean fresh water"" is a nice one, but such a thing doesn't exist. There is ""pure water"" (water that is comprised solely of H2O molecules), ""potable water"", and ""non-potable water"". Those are the only three classifications that are of use here. ""Potable water"" is defined as ""water that is fit for human consumption"". This may require the addition of chemicals **not normally found in water**, such as chlorine and other anti-bacterials. It may require filtration using charcoal, reverse-osmosis, and the like. In other words, your definition still doesn't work.  I think the line you're attempting to draw is based on which side of the glass the additive is meant to impact. Chlorination impacts the water inside the glass, converting it from non-potable to potable. Fluoridation doesn't affect the potability of the water, but is meant to effect the human drinking the water in ways that are non-hydrological. In other words, chlorination treats the water directly, but fluoridation uses the water as a delivery mechanism, just as a vaccine uses a needle as a delivery mechanism.  If you choose to draw *that* line, then your argument starts to gain some coherence. Most importantly, it makes very clear what you do want the municipality to do to your water. When first stated, your argument seemed to imply that you don't want the municipality to treat your water at all, which is ridiculous on its face.",™

t5_2qm4e,bdunderscore,1320471392,"It's complicated. We start with really basic components, and use them to build up to more complex components, and eventually we make it to the computer.  First of all, we start with the basic electrical components. Resistors, voltage sources, capacitors, transistors. How to build these things is a bit out of my field; ask someone versed in semiconductor technology for transistors, at least. In any case, transistors in computers act a bit like a switch. You might have a circuit a bit like this:                  C               |              /     B ------|              ↘               \               |               E  B is the 'base'. C is the collector, and E the emitter. The way it works is, if the voltage at B is higher than E, then a current can flow from C to E, thus increasing E's voltage. When combined with other components, we can start building the next step up - logic gates.  Logic gates take one or more digital inputs (ie, we only care if they're high or low, and will amplify the hell out of the signal anyway so all the subtle analog variations will be lost) and produce one or more outputs according to some defined rule. For example, the NOT gate takes one bit of input, inverts the signal (changes high voltage, ie 1, to low, ie, 0, and vice versa). The circuit diagram for a NOT gate looks a bit like [this](http://www.kpsec.freeuk.com/images/trinvert.gif). There are plenty of [other gates as well](http://230nsc1.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Electronic/trangate.html).  Now, at this point we can build what are called sequential logic circuits. By putting lots of gates together, we can essentially build an uber-gate - which takes lots of inputs and makes lots of outputs, according to some rule. You can build circuits to [add numbers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adder_(electronics\)), for example. But there's no state yet - that is, it can't remember anything. If you put the same set of inputs, it'll always make the same set of outputs.  So, at this point, we add in latches (aka flip-flops) and a clock. A latch is simply a set of gates configured to loop back into themselves, which stores one bit of data. One of the most common kinds in use is the [D flip-flop](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flip-flop_(electronics\)#D_flip-flop) - it takes a bit of input, and a 'clock' bit, and has an output. The moment the clock bit _changes_ from 0 to 1, it takes a snapshot of whatever's on the input bit, and presents it at the output.  Usually, you then connect a clock generator (basically something that toggles between 0 and 1 on a fixed schedule) to all your flip-flops - making sure the signal takes the same amount of time to reach each one. At this point you now have a circuit that can hold state. You can loop your sequential logic circuits back on themselves with a flip-flop in between - essentially, then, your sequential logic becomes a circuit that moves the 'state' of the system (held in the flip-flops) ahead one step. After each step, the clock flips over, the new state is saved in the flip-flops, and yet another state is then built up based on this state (and probably some inputs from the outside world).  Typically there'll be even more high level concepts built upon this, as it's impossible to keep everything in your head otherwise. Things like finite state machines, instruction decode ROMs, buses, muxers, etc etc. If you're interested in the details, I encourage you to watch Harry Porter's [excellent presentation on the design of his relay computer](http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~harry/Relay/VideoTutorial/index.html) - it's basically the same except he uses relays for switches instead of transistors, because they make this very satisfying chunka-chunka noise as the machine runs.  As for how memory works, there are a few major data storage methods in use:  * [Dynamic Random Access Memory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_random_access_memory) (DRAM) - the 'RAM' in your computer. Fast and moderately expensive. It works by creating an array of capacitors, each with a single transistor controlling access. Downside: Data only lasts something on the order of a few hundred milliseconds; the RAM controller must 'refresh' the data before then by reading it off, amplifying the signal, and writing it back. Data is therefore lost when power is lost. * [Static RAM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_random-access_memory) - used for CPU cache RAM. Very expensive, but very very very fast. Basically a flip-flop in nature. No need to refresh. Also loses data when the power is cut, but for different reasons. * [Flash RAM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_ram) - used for those USB memory sticks, as well as storing the computer's BIOS and (recently) in solid-state drives. Slower than DRAM, but less expensive per-byte and preserves data on power-off. Uses some [quantum tunneling weirdness](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_ram#Floating-gate_transistor) that I don't fully understand. Major downsides: It's not possible to _fully_ erase a flash RAM cell, and after some number of write-erase cycles, the cell will eventually fail. Additionally, it's usually not possible to erase a single flash bit; instead, a very large block of flash cells are erased all together; this makes efficiently storing data in flash quite complex. * [Memristors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memristor) - supposedly will come to market in 2-3 years. Like flash, it is persistent, but supposedly it'll be able to achieve higher density and/or more write cycles and/or faster access. May have applications in computation circuits as well, possibly replacing transistors for some applications. Only time will tell if it lives up to all the hype. * Magnetic media, such as [hard disk drives](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_disk) - data is encoded as magnetic fields on a spinning disc or tape. Advantages: Very low cost compared to the memory technologies above, and the technology is very well understood. Downsides: Slooooooooooooooooooow. As in 2-3 orders of magnitude slower than everything else.  There are a number of other experimental technologies such as [phase change memory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase-change_memory) and historical technologies such as [delay line memory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delay_line_memory), but I'll leave it to you to explore wikipedia for these :)",↘

The SFW Porn Network has a significantly higher standard of quality than the rest of Reddit and you're right, we're not an ""atypical"" subreddit.   We have many [submission guidelines](http://code.reddit.com/wiki/help/faqs/HumanPorn#ThisismyfirsttimesubmittingwhatshouldIknow) which all aim to encourage the users to submit original content and original sources. Though, we understand that this is not possible in all cases (sometimes it's too much of a burden on the user to find the original) and so we have some approved hosts which offer no attribution (such as imgur or minus) but do offer reliable links that will last for a very long time.   In the case that you do know the original source and/or the photographer we encourage you [to submit in such a way so that you give the photographer the credit he or she deserves](http://code.reddit.com/wiki/help/faqs/HumanPorn#WhatshouldIincludeinmytitlewhensubmitting). If you look at the Flickr page you will notice the little © All Rights Reserved disclaimer on the right hand side of the page. Users who upload their images to Flickr do in fact hold rights for those images. The network prefers this submission format and as I am a mod who wrote the FAQs and helped come up with the submission format of course I am going to adhere to them. In any case we will not remove submissions if they do not follow this format as it would be somewhat arbitrary especially if they linked to the original source where the photographer can most likely be found but we most certainly prefer it.  That being said, I am not the photographer which is why I have formatted the title in such a way. A lot of users submit their own content and they usually do not credit themselves in the title (other than a casual mention like ""taken by me"" or something). ",©

Except for Shakespeare, no artist has been able to bring out such deep and intimate emotions like he did. Bach offers something that helps us getting closer to what is true in life, as if his music was the music conscience itself, its reassurance and its promise"". &gt; &gt;Today she performs Bach accompanied by the chamber orchestra of the Bavarian radio. In order to open a dialogue with the Brandenburg concertos' composer, she chose two works for orchestra and piano by the Ukrainian composer Valentin Silvestrov, who presents his own music as metaphorical: music after music. Der Bote (1996) is a simple work for strings and piano; Zwei Dialoguen mit Nachwort (2002) is dedicated to Arvo Pärt. In a second part, the Kammerorchester des Bayerischen Rundfunk will perform the Serenade for strings by Czech composer Antonín Dvořák. &gt; &gt;View Hélène Grimaud's page on the Deutsche Grammophon label. &gt; &gt;Photo : © Mat Hennek / DG &gt; ",©

Chessmaster®: Grandmaster Edition expands the scope of chess to include broader principles of learning. Josh Waitzkin's much-anticipated book The Art of Learning (Free Press) is designed to pave the road to successful long-term growth on and off the chessboard. The eight-time National Chess Champion and two-time martial arts World Champion puts users in his shoes in some of the most riveting and formative moments of his chess career, including the legendary climactic game from the book and film Searching for Bobby Fischer. Waitzkin then turns to the classics, introducing beginners to brilliant games from some of the most important players in the history of chess. In his most revealing commentary ever, Waitzkin not only teaches the beginning chess player the fundamentals of the game, but also humanizes the road to mastery. Never has chess been so exciting. -  Taken from the website [here](http://chessmaster.us.ubi.com/xi/pcFeatures.php).",®

t5_2cneq,sarcastic_smartass,1320628696," Mouth breathing From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia   (Redirected from Mouth breather)  This article needs additional citations for verification. Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (May 2011) Mouth breathing ICD-10	R06.5 ICD-9	784.9 Mouth breathing refers to the state of inhaling and exhaling through the mouth. A healthy individual normally breathes through the nose while resting or doing light exercise, and breathes simultaneously through both the nose and mouth during vigorous aerobic exercise, in order to supply sufficient oxygen. Excessive mouth breathing is problematic because air is not filtered and warmed as much as when inhaled through the nose, as it bypasses the nasal canal and paranasal sinuses, and dries out the mouth. Mouth breathing is often associated with congestion, obstruction, or other abnormalities of the upper respiratory tract. Mouth breathing is a diagnostic sign of adenoiditis especially with persistent rhinorrhea.[citation needed] Comorbidities include asthma, obesity, snoring, halitosis, and obstructive sleep apnea.[citation needed] Mouth breathing in children can be a cause of abnormal facial growth primarily in the upper and lower jaw shape, leading to Long Face Syndrome or other malocclusions[1]. Contents  [hide]  1 Dental effect 2 Social perception 3 See also 4 References [edit]Dental effect  Mouth breathing is considered harmful to the dento-oral complex as it can lead to hypotonicity of the upper lip, hyperactivity of the lower lip, distoclusion, harm to dental growth as well as bone growth, high vault of the palate, xerostomia, and adenoid face[citation needed]. [edit]Social perception  In North America, mouth breathing in public is sometimes considered to be less socially acceptable or attractive than nose breathing, as mouth breathers can appear to have a somewhat ""slack jawed"" look, and mouth breathing can amplify or make more obvious the existence of bad breath. The term 'mouth breather' is used as an insult towards a person with a perceived lack of intelligence or someone with poor social skills. This term is widespread as a pejorative in America, but is rarely used in other parts of the world. [edit]See also  Sleep apnea Snoring [edit]References  ^ R.M.

Large, fluorescent no parking stickers show that you mean business. Pierce the ol’ “I thought it was okay to park here” or “I never saw a ticket” defense. These parking stickers do not “just blow off”.  • We offer two different types of adhesives. Our ScrapeIt™ stickers use a strong adhesive that the driver must use a blade to remove. Yes, this is doable – but a real nuisance. Let them think twice next time! Our ClingIt™ stickers have an adhesive that keeps your sticker in place. Yet, you can remove this label cleanly. Of course, in many cases (e.g. the driver’s first infraction), many security officers may not want stick the violation notice to the window. Instead, officers often just place the sticker underneath the wiper, with the still liner attached.  • Our no parking violation stickers are 8"" x 5” - twice as large as the mini labels sold by competitors. You have plenty of room for your writing and your violation sticker cannot be missed.  • Fluorescent No Parking stickers get noticed 75% faster than other warnings. ",™

t5_2qh03,Nienordir,1320636494,"I was quite suprised too when I did the math for the first time, because I didn't expect such a huge gap. Some factors that play into it are the more standardized pc hardware, because going from PCI to AGP, PCIe and several CPU&amp;DDR sockets was quite expensive, but AMD did a really great job with the AM2/2+/3/3+ platform, because you always had a reasonable upgrade path and the compatibility of PCIe generations helped a lot too, then there's the incredibly long console generation, which is 'holding back' gaming with the positive side effect, that even older pc hardware can run many games at 1080p with max settings.    Finally a good pc is so versatile, especially for singles/students. When I moved out I got to keep the old sound system (eventhough I didn't want it), but I never used it, because a PC combined with mp3s is just so much more awesome than a old CD Player. I never bought a crappy TV, because a 23"" HD TFT is more than enough. And since I got a decent (but cheap) capture card to replace a old tv card. I can plug in pretty much anything from old consoles to modern HDMI stuff and run them through my soundcard. No need for another DVD player either. Hell, I even use the PC to tune my guitar and as a makeshift amplifier, because the distortion channel on my crappy amp shorted out. There's pretty much nothing a PC can't do.. ♥    The best thing is once you have a decent system upgrading is a lot cheaper, because you can keep using everything and only replace parts of the core system CPU&amp;MB&amp;RAM / GPU and you're fine. But one of the biggest misconception about console gaming is that people think they run in 1080p and then compare the console to a high end rig that runs BF3 on true 1080p with ultra settings and 16xAA/AF, as if you couldn't run the game on high settings (which still looks a lot better than on the consoles xD). I actually had the opportunity to play Red Dead on my TFT in _'1080p'_ and the textures were so muddy and in the area with many trees I could hardly see the stuff I was looking for, because everything started to blur out badly.    And then there are the glorious steam sales, where you can grab a dozen high quality games of the last years at a price that you almost feel guilty, which puts the PC miles ahead from consoles when it comes to the cost of games..",♥

t5_2qh6c,passportsling,1320642761,"Christian here and I love the movie (never saw the book)  It brings a new perspective in looking at the humanity of Christ. We in the church mostly too focus in the godliness  of Christ and often forget the human side of him   forget that he who is wholly god was at that time 100% human as well.   Mel Gibson's passion of Christ might portray the physical suffering that he had to endure for our sins. But this movie open my eyes that his sufferings was more than just physical ones. the temptations that he had to endure was even harder to overcome  It gives me new understanding to this verse: For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who has been tempted in every way, just as we are--yet was without sin.  (Hebrew 4:15-niv)  He has been tempted in every way. And the movie shows it beautifully, complete with ""alternate ending"" (or dream, if you read roger Ebert review) showing what will happened to the world if the messiah has fallen to temptation:  meaningless and chaos.  It gives me a new understanding of Jesus last words on the cross as well: 'it is done.' Indeed, not just his mission but also all his sufferings and burdens and temptations, physically and mentally had done.  It was a beautiful movie. Was looking for the book but gave up long time ago. Maybe now ill try to look for the eBook .Thanks for reminding me ☺",☺

t5_2qh6c,pbhj,1320675139,"I don't think that makes sense.  If they paid the cost of eating out as mandated by the restaurant then the server is getting the wage that they have agreed to work for. Meanwhile that tip money when spent on a clean water supply for a village, eye-care, general medical supplies, food generation programs, etc., can make a measurably larger contribution to overall happiness.  One doesn't know the specifics, it could be a tight-wad, it could be that they've donated money to people who would otherwise be living a far-far less manageable lifestyle than the person who served the food.  FWIW I work in service industry (customer facing) for lower than the mandated minimum wage in my country (though it's legal) and have never received a tip as much as 10%.  I don't like the coercive tone or the inference that for some reason Christians *must* pay a server more simply because they're Christians. Yes, they should *want* to be just.   For the OP: you should work to get a proper minimum wage instituted and probably talk to management about how you communicate to customers that they (management) pay you less than minimum wage and that you rely on direct customer paid wages (they don't fit the definition of ""tips"" IMO) to make a living. If you're not communicating that to the customers then it's really your boss that's ripping you off isn't it.  Christianity is about relationship to God. It is not a necessary condition of moving towards a better relationship with God that one be generous. It *is* an expected outcome.

That squeal is built into the brakes to let you know they are wearing out, if you wait much longer, you'll have to replace the rotors/drums which will cost quite a bit more.  Does your car make a clunk noise when you turn a corner?  Your CV joint is probably going.  You can confirm this when you park.  Get out of the car and see if you can pull on the tire (away from the body of the car).  If it shifts at all, you need to replace that CV joint ASAP.  Else the wheel falls off while you drive.  If it recently snowed, and you find your car vibrating while you drive at high speed, you probably have ice in your tire treads.  Trying to 'peel out'  to shake out the snow. will make it worse, not better.  Just be patient!  If your area has a custom muffler shop (that make cars sound more like race cars etc) they can often save you ridiculous amounts of money on exhaust repairs.  Muffler shops like Meineke and Munro typically have pre-assembled complete exhaust systems in stock for your car, and their method of repairing anything is to just replace the entire thing costing you 3 or 4 arms and at least 1 leg.  But a custom speed shop is typically able to do lots of custom pipes and can repair a hole or even flex pipe damage for a fraction of the cost.  ALWAYS look at your serpentine belt before taking your car to a repair shop.  Unscrupulous shops may damage your belt with a razor blade to con you into repair costs.  (scraping the blade along a moving belt makes it look cracked and frayed)  Don't forget to clean the inside of your windshield.  It's amazing how dirty it can get, and the wipers can't seem to reach that far. :)  You can easily (read: lazily) diagnose broken tail lights by backing up to a glass-front store at night and testing the lights and looking at the reflection off the glass in the rear-view.  Rather than putting on a blinker and getting out and looking etc.  If your interior fans or your engine compartment smell sweet like maple syrup, you're probably leaking coolant (radiator fluid).  Check inside the driver's doorjam for the proper tire-pressure for your tires.  Always keep them inflated to at least that amount.  It'll save gas and give you better control of your car.

t5_2quw1,kotchomet,1320722636,"If the idea of having a dating sim section of an RPG is what's scaring you away from Personas 3 and 4, then 4 is *not* the one you want to start with. The characters are likable and (somewhat) believable, sure, but their stories all end up the same way: they have some great epiphany on how to live their life because of the Protag's (he has a name, but no one can agree on it) presence in it. The last two scenes in literally every Social Link path (that's essentially what the stories are called for each character you can 'date') are comprised of the NPC telling the Protag exactly where and when their lives had gone so wrong, and then thanking him for showing them the right way to live.  &gt; ""I just didn't want to admit that I was insecure, so I started acting all tough and confident to hide it. But being around you showed me that it's okay to like girly things. Thank you so much, Protagonist! ♥""  That's an exaggeration, of course, but that's what many of the Social Links end up feeling like. You end up getting the impression that the main character is the male twin of Mary Sue. It was also much easier to balance your time and see many of the SL paths to their completion (though finishing them all in one playthrough was extremely difficult and not worth it to most players).  Persona 3 did the Social Links and their stories much, much better. For most of them, the characters in each SL have their own problems that they end up solving on their own. You, the Protagonist, end up befriending them along the way and just sitting back and witnessing their own personal growth. The writing and presentation feels much more natural than P4's script, and the main characters and their stories were kept rightly seperate from what was essentially just a way to expand the gameworld (albeit a nicely-executed one), challenge the player to prioritize their time outside of battle, and assist in creating a more defined combat role for the Protag in-battle. Each SL path is linked to a specific Major Arcanum of the Tarot, the way every Persona -- your summons which define how and how well you can battle -- was; Personae aligned to Arcana whose SL you'd progressed in somewhat gained an extra boost to their starting level when you created them. Personae from a specific Arcanum are balanced to be used in a certain way and at a certain range of levels, and some SL's are encountered later in the game than others; that combined with the extremely slow rate at which your Personae leveled up forced you to continuously create stronger ones by fusing the ones you currently had together as well as choose which Arcana you wanted to progress in over others, which translated into which Personae you had the most proficiency with and what roles the Protag would perform in battle.  **Tl;dr: If you do decide to play either of the latter two Persona games (P1 and the P2 duology don't count because they're so different), start with P3. It's just better.**",♥

t5_2qm4e,visutton,1320738279,"Venusian at Heart, Victoria Sutton ©2011, Chapter 6 	Janis watched as each of her precious work pods was crated into a container for rapid transport to her East quad exile.  But she couldn’t stop thinking about her human subjects and she walked down to the laboratory to see them.   How she wished she could let them go right now, but that would bring the investigation to an unsavory end, and the death penalty would be waiting for her.  This was a prima facia crime, and there would be no trial, just the death penalty.  The Congress had considered it so serious that the uncertainty of a jury could not be risked.  Mistakes might be made with convictions, but it was that serious to the survival of the human race. 	This was the first time that Janis felt completely out of options.  She couldn’t be seen anywhere in this quad or suspicions would soar.   Her hopes of freeing the human subjects were quickly diminishing with each hour, and tomorrow, Ali, the new laboratory director would be giving the order to exterminate them in the afternoon.  It was a blessing indeed, that the human subjects never knew the date or the time of their extermination.  They only knew it would be coming. 	Janis didn’t plan to go on her own to the East quad, she knew she would be escorted, and her escorts had arrived.  As she picked up her wallscreen key, she noticed Ali walking down the hallway toward her, a smile easing across her face.  She was not hiding her pleasure with Janis’s removal and her sudden promotion.  Magellan was not far behind her in the hallway.  Janis couldn’t help but think that Ali was the corporate spy, but from where and why would she be inserting terminator genes?  Or was it simply for retribution because she had mistakenly been inserted with a terminator gene?  Or was it a mistake? 	Janis turned to the information she had discovered about this gene.  Something obscure in the footnote had been nagging at her, and it was this strange property of being triggered by a pheromone, a chemical produced by humans, a natural perfume perceptible only if the right gene happened to be there. 	In her new quarters in exile, Janis began setting up to look at her wallscreen from a comfortable vantage point in the room.   	“Janis, did everything arrive in order?” Georgian appeared as promised.   	“What is it that you are looking at?” Georgian moved into her vantage point to view the wall screen. 	“It’s a world history bioinformatics database.  It describes the use of pheromone triggers for genes.  It looks like it was a technique used in one of the old bioweapons programs last century,” Janis continued to explore the data while Georgian focused on the wallscreen. 	“Let’s take a look at the gene sequence we have been inserting for the last thirty years,” Janis said to Georgian as he looked confused. 	“Look at this gene sequence we have been using since the beginning of the CO2 tolerant gene project, Georgian,” Janice pointed with her chubby hand at the wallscreen.  She wasn’t thinking about her unpolished nails right now. 	“Yes, I see it, and run it through the bioinformatics database,” Georgian said with certainty.  The gene code whirled to a stop like three oranges on a slot machine. 	“There it is.  The gene code is exactly what we have in the bioinformatics database,” Georgian said smugly, “it is the CO2 tolerant gene.” 	“Yes, but it is in a gene sequence, Georgian.  Let’s see what else is in the gene sequence,” Janis said, eyes focused intently on the screen. 	“These are just genes which do nothing, or nothing important,” Georgian said.  We have tested them and run them through the database for thirty years.  Janis, you are really going beyond reason, here.” 	“Wait.  Let’s access the classified bioinformatics database that you gave Ali full and free access to,” Janis smirked a bit. 	“So what, Janis?  I have my reasons for giving her access,” Georgian said, now defensively. 	The gene code whirled again and landed on a match, and just as Janis had expected. 	“It’s a terminator gene,” Janis let the words sink in and watched Georgian’s reaction. 	“My God!  Why did we never discover this before?” Georgian reels from this discovery. 	“It was in our off-limits database, and it was always just in the useless part of the gene sequence, merely a handle bar for the gene we were inserting,” Janis continued, “Now we have a terminator gene in every child conceived in America for the last thirty years.” 	“Look, this is impossible.  If that were true, then we would have people terminating!” 	“It has only been thirty years.  What if the terminator ends in thirty years, like Ali’s claim, or what if it is triggered by something like the old bioweapons plan?” 	“You mean by pheromones?” Georgian asked incredulously. 	“Yes, I mean by pheromones and what if Ali has been coded for the release of the pheromone?  Maybe she could trigger the gene to begin termination with one person she was close to, but so what?”  Janis said. 	“It would have to be dispersed over the earth, and there is nothing that can do that other than a nuclear blast and a pheromone would disappear in the cloud immediately, like alcohol evaporating in the sun,”  Georgian surmised. 	Just then the Progenitor alarm sounded, and alert-optics pierced their exchange.   	Janis and Georgian looked around, and the hallways filled with emergency Progenitor police, each reaching their monitoring stations in seconds. 	“It looks like you don’t need to worry about further rumors,” the investigator with the scar above his eyebrow had appeared behind her quietly emerging from the hallway chaos, “we have had another human subject escape, and this time it is a record number.  We estimate almost 250 on the way to the Everglades.  It’s a full moon, too.  Really bad timing for us.”   	Janis was stunned.  An escape? 	Georgian smiled, “I knew you were innocent all the time, we just had to prove it,” he said nervously, “I told Ali that I knew you were innocent but she kept telling us that she had seen you behaving suspiciously the day of the last escape.”   	Ali.  No surprise.  Janis knew Georgian was just as suspicious of her as the rest of the rumormongers.  But she couldn’t worry about Georgian’s fickleness now, she had to focus on Ali and what she might do to trigger the terminator gene. 	“Where is Ali, anyway?” Georgian asked. 	“I know that she was going with Magellan to hike Mt. Ranier today, after closing,” Janis said, still wondering how the human subjects had escaped. 	“Now that’s bad timing,” Georgian remarked, “Mt. Ranier is rumbling and the entire northeast is under a volcanic ash warning.” 	“What happens to volcanic ash, Georgian?” Janis said rhetorically, “A huge cloud forms and covers most of the earth for the next year,” Janis grabbed her coat and started for the door with Georgian following her.",©

As he sipped on the Dr. Pepper, he knew it was time he gets done with the shopping. There it was at the end of the clown pink shit aisle full of tissues and Huggies™; right next to the aisle of mars chocolates .   Glaring bright - Kraft™ Jet Puffed Marshmallows is all he can see now.  ""Should I get some cat nip?"", he pondered. It has been like his daily habit - getting cat nip for his kittens. They were his babies. They were all the friends he had.   Cursing at the kid who made fun of his wheelchair, he picks up that pack of Jet Puffed Marshmallows. Repenting his idea to carry a Dr. Pepper can while shopping, he throws it away. It is his anger.   He makes faces as he rolls past that kid who is now standing beside his dad. With such maneuvering abilities, at speeds like that, inside a mall, anyone could bet he must belong to some Paralypmic team. But he was not.  He had lost both his legs in the war.   The young and bubbly cashier looked at him creepily while she packed his pack of Kraft™ Jet Puffed Marshmallows, a roll of duct tape, cat nip and a pack of condoms.   ""Thank you, Sir! Have a good night! &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232; ""  He is home in no time. It's the jetpacks in his upgraded wheelchair.   Without wasting any more time, he rolls towards the kitten shelter. His Doberman barks at him. It is hungry. But it's chained. He is angry. Given a chance he will gnaw his teeth into our hero. He can be that dog you want to see in a graphic novel.   ""Purr!"", the kitten cries. It knows it's time. It's what it had been waiting all it's life till now.   Within minutes he pours all the contents of the Marshmallow pack into the big bowl. It's like he has become an expert on it.   ""Click!"" Done. That was the first of his pics of the act. This one is going into Imgur and then on Reddit.   He clicks on submit and BAM! it's on Reddit. Now it's the waiting game until he sees his e peen grow.   He pours some scotch and lights his cigarette before he gets down for the next of the pics. He takes a puff from his Marlboro.   He finishes his drink and rolls his wheelchair to the kitten bowl. It would be while till he will be back with the next set of pics for his other favorite site: www.4chan.org    ",™

t5_2qh6c,TheFlyingBastard,1320780676,"&gt; So what are you saying Jehovah isnt the source of abject morality? That there is a better source? Or that man could do better?  Well, obviously. Yahweh does not exist. And even if he did, just because he supposedly lives in some kind of heavenly abode above the clouds it doesn't make him right. In fact, I'm going to pose you with a challenge.  *Is something right because Yahweh commands it so, or does Yahweh command it because it's right?*  &gt; How ius your argument different then Korah murmuring against Moses?  Korah was critical. So he should be. Thomas was also critical. So he should be. But no, ""blessed are those who have believed without having seen"". Just take it aaaaall on faith. *That* is how you stay ignorant. *That* is how you stand still - not just as a group, but as a species. Korah's big mistake - in my eyes - was trying to stir up trouble rather than actual discussion. But it certainly does not warrant such an abhorrent punishment.  Yahweh seems to be extraordinarily butthurt with humans questioning the top brass claiming leadership.  &gt; I may have some things I dont agree with but you know what? I'll wait on perfect and then I can ask Jehovah directly. How is leaving the org and turning on Jehovah and the ones he chose going to answer your questions?  Because first of all, Yahweh does not exist. Also, once you get out of this bubble you'll find a world that holds more answers than any Watchtower book can provide you. And then you'll see that they're full of it. I mean, like, everything. From science to reasoning, it's horribly flawed to the point where I am convinced that in some places they are doing it on purpose. All of this in defense of a flawed book.  &gt; Who will learn more about the world those that have a short time left or those that are granted the gift of everlasting life? Dude I like science and all the other things and plan to pursuit them but for now i'll wait on Jehovah.  You should probably pursue science *before* you die. Nobody will live forever. It's a fairy tale. Yahweh does not exist, remember?  &gt; Isnt teaching people the bible keys to happiness and everlasting life a greater key to maximizing their happiness?  Nope. The bible has a little bit of good philosophy, but it really doesn't give us anything special that you can't figure out with some common sense. Plus, as mentioned above, it encourages blindly following people.  &gt; the world is on a knifes edge a powder keg because of all the injustice and greed.  It's not nearly as bad as the WTS makes it seem. There's some political tension, but injustice and greed is mostly an issue in countries with a lot of religion. The more secular a society is, the better it actually functions.  &gt; You things these atheist high priest like sam harris , dawkins etc are going to personally tell you they where sorry and wrong on the day of armageddon?  Armageddon does not exist. Are you fear-mongering now?   Second, they are not high priests. I really wish you would stop strawmanning.   Third, sure. They have admitted they are wrong. ""I used to be of the opinion that x, but now I think y because z."" is something that I have heard more than once. But why is this so relevant? Why do they need to apologize? They are not high priests, they are speakers. They do not claim divine inspiration. They do not claim to be right all the time. That's religious leaders. They put their opinion out there with the caveat that it is only their view and that it is alright to disagree.   &gt; How do think Satan feels having you as a pawn? Dude you have the truth that leads to everlasitng life what evolutionist and atheist who are putting their faith in sicnece wish to have and you turned your back on it really?  Satan does not exist. The Truth® that leads to everlasting life is a baloney too. There is not a single shred of evidence that any JW has so far provided for their faith. Perhaps you can be the first one? Perhaps you can provide evidence for say, creation? Or how about just the existence of a god? Any god. Doesn't even have to be your god. Can you do that?  &gt; i'm trying to find out why someone who potentially had it all, could walk away from it. How a person that should have clearly seen satan in the background not chooses to fall in line with satan and his lies.  Well, first, Satan does not exist. Second, if you want to know the answer, perhaps next time you should ask ""Hey, what is your story? Why were you a JW first and now you're not?""  &gt; Dude there are only 2 sides. For Thor or you are automatically on Jörmungandr's side. There are no thousands of other options. For Thor's sovereignty and rule or not. Obviously not.  Fixed that for you.   See how inane that looks when you don't have any evidence to back up your beliefs?  Again, out of the thousands of options, I have merely chosen the one with the least assumptions.  &gt; That is not really knowing much more then christians is it?  You're shifting the goalposts now. Some atheists don't know *much* more, but on average, atheists *do* know more. And that was the matter at hand. It's irrelevant anyway; the believers need to come up with evidence. Can you come up with evidence (1 Peter 3:15)?  &gt; No its not and I cannot for the life of me understand how you can again choose it over knowing the truth about God and Satan and his lies. He is not said to be misleading the entire earth because he isnt, it is because he is.  Satan does not exist. What you call the Truth® is nothing more than a confabulation based on old texts without any evidence to back it up whatsoever.  &gt; Well what would you call a person who held the keys to everlasting life, with perfection in mind and body. Then he turned his back on it to run with a bunch of people who claim they are independent but dont know that they are in fact also being mislead. Really dude I cannot see how you got from here to there. Other then a really bad heart condition. Because no sane person would make that jump.  Perhaps something is wrong with your reasoning then. I'd say you are badly mistaken on the initial assumptions on the situation. For example, nobody holds the keys to everlasting life. Satan does not exist. Yahweh does not exist.  I suggest you read up on your own mythology - and here comes the trick - *outside the confines of the Watchtower Society*. I know it's a huge leap to go from that walled garden of derp to gaining actual knowledge, but if you really do value science as you say you do, you can get over it.  &gt; We end our conversation here.  Ah, is that the way you handle things? First make long, drawn out posts, spouting your stories and claims and then you push the eject button?  Have a spine. Back up your claims with evidence or bite the bullet and admit you have been making some very bad basic assumptions.",®

All for everything else but i feel like talking about money so soon... if it's an awesome product/service, having to pay for it is not a problem.  There will not be a free plan. So I'm simply being clear with my prospects here. I'm not interested to the email contact of someone that already knows (s)he will not pay anything for such a service. No free plan means no spammers, no trolls and better (because really motivated) community members. The ""elite"" term I used in my startup short pitch means exactly this. Obviously there will be an affordable basic plan.  &gt; anyway, i too was thinking about something like this. but screw social, i'd rather set goals and have the site complain when i fail to meet them. After all i know what I need to get done and when i'm not getting things done, so I don't need some random internet guy to tell me to pick up the pace. I would rather the site scream at me because i haven't gotten things done that i previously said that I would. keep commitments to yourself, screw everyone else.  If you think a site autocomplaining (how can it really do it?) when you fail to meet your goals is enough for you, you can take a look at Hasslers.org by Reddit user *fatjesus* (see other comments under this thread). On *[asaclock™](http://www.asaclock.com/?utm_source=reddit_entrepreneur&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=cs1)* you will not be in contact with *some random internet guy*, but with not-anonymous like-minded people which you'll voluntarily establish reciprocal ""control"" relations with.

Taking a look at what you have put together so far and what i've interacted with (AKA where you put your complexity) i'm not expecting anything useful. but i signed up anyway, we'll see what happens. You would likely do better with a more generalized implementation - startup founders is definitely a little specific.

t5_2qldo,ruru32,1320818515,"&gt; There will not be a free plan  would suggest revisiting this. Not that it absolutely needs one, but for such a niche market you'll certainly want as many users as possible. Even if it's ""view only"" of some sort. Totally with you on it filtering out spam and all, though. Definitely a plus to a paid service.   but I guess I simply didn't like the ""1 year 10% off"" image. Because you haven't even really covered what it does, or even what the price is going to be. Like when installers say ""call now and get $5K cashback!"" which makes you wonder ""well WTF does it cost that $5K just gets tossed around like that?""   &gt;If you think a site autocomplaining (how can it really do it?) when you fail to meet your goals is enough for you, you can take a look at Hasslers.org by Reddit user fatjesus (see other comments under this thread). On asaclock™ you will not be in contact with some random internet guy, but with not-anonymous like-minded people which you'll voluntarily establish reciprocal ""control"" relations with. I'll not screw social. Nope.  Your site sounds primarily social based however the three primary uses of procrastination are as a tool, as a Weapon, or as a Shield (credit:Monica Basco). So I fail to see how any kind of buddy system or what have you is going to negate the underlying reasoning for the behavior. But it's not like your site really outlines much of anything about what it does or how it works, so i have limited information to operate off of. and regarding your ""how can it really do it?"" there's e-mail, IM, text message, phone calls, other people you know... did network monitoring for a few years, so i have some experience with important notifications and getting people to act on them.   &gt; You cannot technically judge the app from the landing page, you know it.  correct. But there's something to be said about where you put your energies, what the pages say / contain and don't say / contain. And other sites (such as your shiny new blog) and throwing in the ™ pretty much every chance you get. You put a lot of focus on things that don't matter, so it makes me wonder what focus you'll be able to put on things that actually do.   &gt;my niche is that of startup founders.  A very tight niche that is indeed. Between the people who actually are that, and then those that even know about your site, and then those that see value and/or can pay for it. And again, this sounds like a social paid service. Which gives you a chicken and egg problem on top of already having one. Getting people to use a free site is hard enough.  &gt; ""i'm expecting this to fail like whoa"" :) so gentle :)  Yes, i've heard some pretty awful ideas lately, so my tolerance is shrinking, i admit. It's just constant facepalm. Your site could work but i'm betting it won't.  It's a real problem that you're trying to solve, but your target audience &amp; execution leave a lot to question. If this was a startup, and asaclock(™!) was the product being developed, and i was being interviewed for a developer position, I'd walk out. I have no faith in it. I don't mean to bash you; by all means do SOMETHING versus nothing. But this just doesn't sound like a worthwhile venture to me.   but if you build it, and people come and pay you, that's what matters. and I can't tell if people will do that or not. I'm doubtful, because I wouldn't use it and don't believe others will find it useful either. or that it scratches the itch but in a roundabout way. ",™

In the second quarter, 41 metro areas had posted annual price gains.

They do not contribute to the creation of Bromate.  &gt;Wouldn't that be an argument FOR a different colour though? If the visible colour had nothing to do with the absorbtion rate of the rays that need absorbing?  You're assuming they care about visible light. They don't. It's cheaper to make them black so they are black.   &gt;And I don't see any ""black sunscreen"" on the market, if you compared that with the ones available, yes, you would be significantly hotter.  Sunscreen is [opaque](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:UV_and_Vis_Sunscreen.jpg) to UV radiation. In other words, it's a UV absorber.   &gt;And I don't see any reference to the timeframe this solution is supposed to be aplicated other than ""they are building an underground one"".  They dropped the balls there in mid 2008. 3 years is hardly a timeframe worthy of concern for the slow transferrance of some unspecified chemical from plastic to a giant lake. Not that it matters. From a manufacturer's website:   "" Armor Balls™ are manufactured with : High Density Polyethylene (HDPE) -- Suitable for working conditions up to 176°F (80°C). HDPE is recommended for all external applications due to its enhanced resistance to freezing conditions. **Black, UV stabilizing additives prevent the degrading effects of sunlight.** HDPE is also recommended for demineralized water and Chromic acid applications.""  &gt;And as far as bacteria and chlorine go... Thats how evolution works, you have a habitat with a pressure, and you get adaption.  Surely you don't imagine that engineers at a water storage facility are guessing? Water sanitation isn't exactly a new science. Exactly no one is sitting around wringing their hands over the possibility that bacteria will evolve to live in chlorinated environments.

t5_2qm4e,emporsteigend,1320948687,"&gt;I've read papers by Elman, and I might suggest you read 'The Blank Slate' by Pinker.  I have ""The Blank Slate"". It was amusing. Choice excerpts:  &gt;[One logical] talent [allegedly not captured by connectionism] is compositionality: the ability to entertain a new, complex thought that is not just the sum of the simple thoughts composing it but depends on their relationships. The thought that cats chase mice, for example, cannot be captured by activating a unit each for “cats,” “mice,” and “chase,” because that pattern could just as easily stand for mice chasing cats.  &gt;[Another] is recursion: the ability to embed one thought inside another, so that we can entertain not only the thought that Elvis lives, but the thought that the National Enquirer reported that Elvis lives, that some people believe the National Enquirer report that Elvis lives, that it is amazing that some people believe the National Enquirer report that Elvis lives, and so on. Connectionist networks would superimpose these propositions and thereby confuse their various subjects and predicates.  Too bad Pinker hadn't heard of [recursive auto-associative memory](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.30.6437&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf), which had been first published back in *1990* and neatly addresses his concerns. When did The Blank Slate come out? 2001?  Pinker claims at one point not to be indulging the GOFAI fetishism of traditional cognitive psychology:  &gt;[The preceding discussion about the computational nature of the mind is not] to say that the brain works like a digital computer, that artificial intelligence will ever duplicate the human mind, or that computers are conscious in the sense of having first-person subjective experience.  But his material in other books indicates that he is, at least tacitly. In Language Learnability and Language Development and, as far as I can tell, in How the Mind Works, Pinker gives combinatorial explosion as an argument for innatism: innate knowledge must constrain the set of possible computations that could be made in any given domain.  What he doesn't realize is that the brain doesn't do tree searches like a typical GOFAI program and that combinatorial explosion actually works *for* the brain, rather than *against* it, as Paul Churchland pointed out, by greatly expanding its representational space.  (An approriately embodied artificial intelligence could probably one day rivial or exceed human intelligence but that's another issue altogether.)  Pinker mentions the work of Geoffrey Miller, another notoriously wild speculator of EP:  &gt;In The Mating Mind, the psychologist Geoffrey Miller argues that the impulse to create art is a mating tactic: a way to impress prospective sexual and marriage partners with the quality of one's brain and thus, indirectly, one's genes. Artistic virtuosity, he notes, is unevenly distributed, neurally demanding, hard to fake, and widely prized. Artists, in other words, are sexy. Nature even gives us a precedent, the bowerbirds of Australia and New Guinea. The males construct elaborate nests and fastidiously decorate them with colorful objects such as orchids, snail shells, berries, and bark. Some of them literally paint their bowers with regurgitated fruit residue using leaves or bark as a brush. The females appraise the bowers and mate with the creators of the most symmetrical and well-ornamented ones.  I personally emailed Miller asking him why creative people tend to be less fecund than others (source: Cambridge Handbook of Creativity) and he came up with an ad hoc explanation about modern prophylaxis. Then I asked him how that could be tested. No answer.  I might add that creativity has been linked with schizotypy, which in turn is linked, again, with lower fecundity, as well as social anhedonia. So, in other words, evolve creativity out of mate selection, then avoid and shy away from everyone. Makes sense! It must be wonderful to be an evolutionary psychologist.  And his derogation of modern art in the same chapter, essentially pure speculation, is just obnoxious. Bach is objectively better than Terry Riley. Why? Because Evolution™. Never mind that some people delight in art forms that seem utterly discordant to most people, such as black metal. They must have defective Aesthetics Modules™.  Dreadful book. If I didn't have it in PDF format, I'd have already used it to kindle a fire when we had that massive blackout a few weeks ago.  &gt;So, you think the structure of the human eye is down to 'self-organization', and is not encoded in the genome?  I don't think it's terribly controversial that development is an emergent product of genetic expression and I recommend At Home in the Universe to you, or Origins of Order if you are more mathematically and biologically inclined, both by Stuart Kauffman.  In any case, we're talking about the brain, not the eye. How is modularity of higher cognitive functions compatible with the coarse reaction-diffusion development of the neocortex?",™

t5_2rzgi,Mozai,1320993640,"""enforced""?  Oh good gosh, no.  Rule 0 still applies and will never be obsolete.  I'm not suggesting that GMs should be restricted in their non-combat storytelling, any more than a melee system restricts combat storytelling to a series of  ""step forward, swing sword"" instructions.  Here's an example: a GM with a party of fighters, and not a single magician, knows that her players want physical melee.  There are rules for physical melee.  She still has the choice of when, where and how, or even to use a magical opponent when it is appropriate to shake up the players.  Since the players explicitly chose their combat roles by their class/career choices, she has cues for what sort of combat-story the players want to see. Now, where would a GM get these cues for what her players want in the social or emotional parts of the game?  Does she make a guess, bring in a caliginous hate-interest for a character and /whoops/ that player is uncomfortable role-playing blackrom .  If a player was uncomfortable with putting their character in physical danger, they'd pick an archer or wizard.  If they're uncomfortable with ♠, there's no cue in the mechanics of a combat-oriented rpg for the DM to know this.  I guess it comes down to what kind of game you want when you are making a SBURB/SGRUB-themed game.  Do you want a combat game?  Weird puzzle shit?  Time shennanigans?  Quadrants of romance?  One could say ""we have a combat system, just make up the rest of the stuff,"" and I would counter ""why is the combat system so special that it gets rules when the other aspects of the game have to be made-up on the spot?""   Would it be upsetting to just make-up the combat skirmishes on-the-spot?  If so, why is that not okay, but playing by ear for the social conflicts *is* okay?  EDIT: I don't think making the social/emotional parts of the game as systematic as the combat part of D&amp;D or DarkHeresy is the answer either (though the idea of a battlemat for blackrom does have it's appeal... or moving minis around a shipping wall...).  I don't want to wrench the game from one extreme (absence) to the other (regimented), just away from the extreme of ""absence; make it up as you go along, hope the players are okay with it.""",♠

t5_2qzb6,well_golly,1321044437," **There have been 50 apologies ... so then ... what about all these apologies?**   First of all, it can be said that Japanese citizens have a keen **awareness** of their culpability during the war.  They routinely **watch** their leaders get up and make speeches of apology in their elected assembly (their representative body called 'The Diet'), as well as in foreign countries at press conferences and meetings (***including***, notably, in **China** and Korea, although the apology parade makes regular stops in Europe and the United States, as well).  Because Japan has a **free press**, their news sources and televisions feature frequent apologies and contrition regarding the war.  They all **see** this regularly.  They all **understand** this.  They elect the leaders who do the apologizing, and the apologies are thus made on their own behalfs.  Conversely, the Chinese dictatorship stirs the pot continuously, by denying or downplaying the existence of a constant stream of apologies from Japan.  In this way, the dictatorship in Beijing *avoids scrutiny* about the massive crimes that Beijing has committed against its own people.  In 1985, Japan’s new government **apologized to its own citizens**, to the Japanese people themselves, for the damage the previous Japanese dictatorship had done to the Japanese people.  It may be said that crimes against humanity are perhaps even more treacherous when a government harms its own people.  **What did Beijing ever do to anyone?**  10-20 times as many Chinese died under Mao, as died under all of Japan’s invasions combined (even when you lump in all other countries like the Philippines as one large ‘act’ by Japan).  This goes on up until the 1980s.  Hardly a peep is spoken about it in China.  Mao is still a hero.  ***On a personal note***:  I know a woman from China who was kidnapped by the Beijing government in the 1970s, and made into a slave.  It precipitated from a known policy that was part of an open act of hostility by Beijing against the people China the “Cultural Revolution”.  She was made a slave by Beijing, and sent to work as slave labor on a farm where she was routinely tortured for purposes of amusement.  Her crime as a little girl all of 12 years old, was that her parents were both educated.  Her family was non-political, her parents just both had college degrees.  I guess that little girl ‘had it coming’.  China owes **her** an apology.  In fact, I think China owes her a few $USD million in compensation for the kidnapping and enslavement, but the never will pay.  Millions of Chinese did *not* survive this and the many other acts by Beijing *against* the people of China, and so they are no longer alive to receive an apology.  **Is it technically possible for Beijing to apologize at all?**  As Japan is a representative democracy, all of these apologies (even the one from their now powerless figure-head Emperor) are literally statements made on behalf of ALL the people of Japan.  Their government represents all the Japanese people.  Being a dictatorship, perhaps China is incapable of demonstrating the true desires and the will of its own people.  Perhaps this is a reason behind Beijing’s non-expression of humility about its own horrible crimes.  The questions being:  Upon whose behalf can Beijing apologize?  Upon whose behalf can Beijing truly speak at all?  It would seem that Beijing can’t apologize on behalf of the Chinese people, because Beijing is not China, and China is not Beijing.  However, the dictatorship in Beijing is a continuation of Mao’s original dictatorship, and it has a short pedigree that flows back to Mao himself, and his co-conspirators.  **But that is the rub:  Perhaps China’s government is *uniquely positioned* to apologize for its own past government deeds.**  After all, Beijing's leadership are the direct heirs to the atrocities their brutal regime committed.  Many of them sat in leadership as the atrocities went on.    The Beijing regime is **un**interrupted, unlike Japan which has experienced a sharp and total regime change.  In Beijing, they are the same leaders as before - a continuous line of unapologetic dictatorship.   **Japan even has even made public a government policy of continued apology:**  On January 16, 1998, the Japanese press secretary Tanaka was asked a series of pointed questions by the Australian press.  One notable answer stands out:  “**Q:** *So, you do not see a need to extend that (special apology for Britain) apology to particular countries?*   **Spokesman Tanaka:** *Whenever the opportunity arises and whenever necessary, we do not hesitate to renew our determination (to assert the sentiments of our apology to the world on June 9, 1995)* ”  But Beijing wears its own atrocities like a badge of honor.  Whenever scrutiny arises, the distraction policy in Beijing is thus: “Apology?!  Why should ***WE*** apologize?  We committed **our** atrocities for “the greater glory of China ™”!  Instead, **JAPAN** should apologize (*again*)!”  The first apology Japan issued contained an important statement of truth:  *“The Japan of today is not the Japan of the past, but, as its Constitution indicates, is a peace-loving nation.” *   Japan is peace loving now.  I mean, it isn’t like Japan has invaded Tibet, or shipped massive arms to fight proxy wars with child soldiers in Africa over mineral rights or something.  As the apology parade continues and the Chinese press is ordered to under-report it, Japan has even begun to **reference back** to its ***prior*** apologies in newer apologies (since about 2000).  So now we see apologies referencing apologies, referring to still more previous apologies.  I predict that in 1,000 years, there will be people living on an international space settlement on Mars.  There we will still find a Japanese guy, apologizing daily to a Chinese guy.  Of course, there will still be no apology from Beijing about its *own* atrocities against its own people.  **About me:**  I am person with friends who have come from China, Taiwan, Japan, Korea, Malyasia and all over Europe and Latin America. I recognize the indisputable fact that Japan has already apologized and continues to apologize. I think it is right that Japan continue to apologize as it already has. When **China** begins to apologize to its ***own*** people, that will truly be a “Great Leap Forward”.  (**tl; dr:**  Japan apologizes continuously, and has always apologized.  Japan apologizes at Japanese press meetings in Japan, in China, and all over the world.  By this constant activity, the Japanese people are keenly aware of the problems they caused in the past.  During WWII and for half a century afterwards, Beijing killed far more Chinese than Japan ever did.  The dictators in Beijing have committed massive crimes against the Chinese as recently as the late 1970s.  China still worships their brutal dictators.  The current Chinese dictatorship is a straightforward continuation of these brutal actors.  There has been no regime change in China.  Beijing is unapologetic.    There has been regime change in Japan, yet their democratically elected leaders still see reasons to apologize to the World, to Asia, to China in particular, and to their own people (the Japanese).  Beijing may be technically incapable of apologizing for the metaphorically cannibalistic acts of the Chinese people on the whole (as Beijing does not truly represent the Chinese people in a democratic sense).  However, as a clear continuation of the same regime, China owes apologizes on behalf of that regime, and massive financial compensation that it has still yet to admit to.) ",™

t5_2qie5,TroutM4n,1321080191,"Technique-wise here's my best advice:   1.) Count in your head.  Understand how many beats you're expected to ""fill"" and try to start realizing that it doesn't matter so much which drum you're hitting, but more that you're keeping the rhythm and tempo. If you start by just pushing yourself to play something and make sure you know when to come back into the main groove, the rest will come with time. You'll begin to find certain fills that work better in different time signatures or with different drum arrangements and eventually, you'll get to the point where you're not really thinking so much about sticking patterns or counting: you'll just feel the patterns of the song and let them flow out.  2.) Practice Rudiments like you're getting paid and someday you might be. . .  damn I just came up with that, but it's not too bad. ™ 2011  *edit* - the most common mistake when ""filling"" is to drastically rush tempos.

t5_2qh0u,kerat,1321110332,"&gt;You are still generalizing that everyone in the army kills. This man did tours in Iraq that does not mean he killed anyone.  I already explained the logical contradiction of what you are saying. But since English doesn't seem to be your first language, let me repeat:  ""sharpening the murderer's knife for the purpose does not free one from responsibility. Cooking the murderer's breakfast to ensure he has energy to do more killing does not make him a hero. Again, more simplistic b.s from you.""  He joined an illegal war. He joined an immoral war. I don't care if he spent his time giving other soldiers blowjobs - he's still a criminal and an idiot.  &gt;You are from a different state of mind. You cannot fathom anything like volunteering for service.  Oh yeah of course not. Only True Americans© can understand real sacrifice. HOORAAH! FUCK YEAH! AMERICAAA!  Hey I think I'll apply for citizenship of your country. Then when we're both Americans we can jack each other off! ALRIGHT FUCK YEAH! AMERICAAA! NO ONE IN THE WORLD UNDERSTANDS US YEAH!   &gt;If that isn't honorable, then does it become honorable when you kill someone else far away? &gt;Im going to go off on a limb and say THE NAZIS.  Hahahaha. How old are you man? You have the logical consistency of a sock.  You just told me that fighting for your country is honorable.   Then you told me that joining the army doesn't mean that you kill people.  Then you told me that people who join the army don't necessarily believe what their governments tell them.  And when I ask you about murder, you tell me it's honorable if they were Nazis! Hahahaha! So rich! What about all the Nazis who didn't agree with their governments? What about all the Nazis who joined the army for ""respectable healthcare""?   Again - you only see an ""enemy"". Not human beings. You only empathize with your own kind. To your sick mind all other human beings don't matter, because this guy needed ""good healthcare""  If your country is so fucking pathetic that it can't offer its citizens healthcare unless they go off to murder others, then your country is sick and rotten from inside out.  And you didn't even answer my question. I asked:  **Is it honorable to kill your neighbour if it is to ensure you get ""respectable health benefits"" or to ensure that your kids have a good future?**  And:  **If that isn't honorable, then does it become honorable when you kill someone else far away?**  You answered: The Nazis.  Ok, now forget about the Nazis. What about Afghans? What about Iraqis? What about Yemenis or Somalis that your country is now bombing? Are you admitting that killing them isn't honorable whatsoever? Because to me that sounds like a confession.    &gt;We honor both WWII and IRAQ veterans on this day, not because we agree with the government, not because we condone what is done, but because there is a sense of pride for a fellow countryman who is willing to give up his life for HIS COUNTRY.   This is what you don't understand you underaged nitwit. All those other people ALSO died for their countries. You are honoring someone who voluntarily went to kill others for some idiotic childish concept like nationalism, and because someone in the government told him to do it. That is fucking pathetic.   &gt;Unfortunately that also may involve being deployed into a country he is not willing to invade.    Oh yes, ""unfortunately"". Unfortunate for almost a million dead Iraqis. What an elitist sick fuck you are.    &gt;If he disagrees? Dis-honorable discharge, no job, eventual homelessness.   That's because your country is fucking pathetic. No human being should be forced to go off to kill others in fear of joblessness or homelessness. You've become a drone. A simpleton.

Rousseau is to blame for starting it, really: ""private property is the root of all evil! we need to, like, reject modern society and get back to a holistic wholeness with nature and reject materialism and smile on your brother everybody, try to love one another right now.""   it's a *coercive* movement, with a seed of totalitarianism: about 70 thousand protesters have the chutzpa to call themselves ""the 99%"". your reply proves it: WE NEED A NEW SOCIETY! huh, we do?

This is reminiscent of the Bolsheviks calling themselves the ""majority"" who spoke for the working class in fact, they were a small minority of wealthy intellectuals in the Russian political system who resorted to violence and mass terror when the majority rejected their plan for ""bettering society.""  but when Rousseauist fantasy clashes with ugly reality, as it always does, the Rousseauists react with violence and then nihilism.  OWS has burned through this cycle in only a few months. if it's typical of other leftist movements, it's about time for a few bombings or assassinations in the name of the revolution, after which the bulk of supporters will become disillusioned and fall away from the movement.

t5_2qm4e,Copterwaffle,1321137040,"There is a ton of peer-reviewed, scientific research on yoga. Here's an abstract form an article in the Mt. Sinai Journal of Medicine (2010):       Mechanisms underlying the modulating effects of yogic cognitive-behavioral practices (eg, meditation, yoga  asanas, pranayama breathing, caloric restriction) on human physiology can be classified into 4 transduction pathways: humoral factors, nervous system activity, cell trafficking, and bioelectromagnetism. Here we give examples of these transduction pathways and how, through them, yogic practices might optimize health, delay aging, and ameliorate chronic illness and stress from disability. We also recognize that most studies of these mechanisms remain embedded in a reductionist paradigm, investigating small numbers of elements of only 1 or 2 pathways. Moreover, often, subjects are not long-term practitioners, but recently trained. The models generated from such data are, in turn, often limited, top-down, without the explanatory power to describe beneficial effects of long-term practice or to provide foundations for comparing one practice to another. More flexible and useful models require a systems-biology approach to gathering and analysis of data. Such a paradigm is needed to fully appreciate the deeper mechanisms underlying the ability of yogic practice to optimize health, delay aging, and speed efficient recovery from injury or disease. In this regard, 3 different, not necessarily competing, hypotheses are presented to guide design of future investigations, namely, that yogic practices may: (1) promote restoration of physiologic setpoints to normal after derangements secondary to disease or injury, (2) promote homeostatic negative feedback loops over nonhomeostatic positive feedback loops in molecular and cellular interactions, and (3) quench abnormal 'noise' in cellular and molecular signaling networks arising from environmental or internal stresses.

This is for the protection of those in the TF2 community, including all of you reading this, and we do have your best interests in mind.   2- If the tagged person claims that a friend, a brother, cousin, or so on did the scam using their account, but it wasn't them, we still usually will not unban.  Why?  Because as admins we are repeatedly lied to by all kinds of scoundrels and should we simply start 'trusting' account owners whose accounts have scammed, without eveidence to support their claim, would be disasterous for all of us in the end.   3- Every person is ultimately responsible for their own account.  Should one choose to ""loan it out,"" then they need to ""man up"" and take responsibility for any wrong doing the person that is controlling it may do.   This case is still ongoing and we as admins are doing what we can to make it fair for everyone, and not make exceptions in some situtaions without evidence that supports an untagging.   Peace all  :) ",☠

There is no reason you can't drive on weed, and some studies have shown an insignificant benefit to your driving.   The latest research by Schaffer in 2010 showed that when adjusted for age none of the data they reviewed from multiple studies showed any significant increase in risk of accident between cannabis smokers and non-smokers.  The other factor is that people who smoke are more cautious.  They over-estimate their level of impairedness (unlike alcohol which has the opposite effect) and are less likely to drive, and more likely to drive more cautiously if they do drive, meaning that the chance of someone driving when they are not capable of it is extremely reduced (unlike alcohol which has the opposite effect).   So, the only thing you are doing by propagating this superstition is to help prop up the fear-mongering that those who would oppose legalization use to justify the continued prohibition.  The lie you believe and tell on their behalf does you no good.   If someone doesn't feel they can drive safely, they shouldn't.  Regardless of any other factors.  Eating food while driving or driving with friends in the car is more dangerous, as far as risk of accident, than smoking cannabis.  ",®

On your side you claim to have ""the diffusion of power"" -- which only exists when the State enforces antitrust laws to prevent monopolization and concentration of wealth and corporate political power -- and simultaneously the amorphous, catch-all buzzword ""freedom"" which in your typical libertarianspeak means zero corporate regulations and freedom to control the political system with unlimited concentrated wealth, and freedom to control the tort system with ""tort reform"", i.e. ""freedom"" from class-action lawsuits against corporate manslaughter ... with those class-action lawsuits always being conveniently post-hoc and too-late, after Dow Chemical has poisoned the Colorado River system and killed hundreds of cattle and given children cancer:  ""Whoops, but at least we'll let the Free Market Magic™ (that replaced Big Gub'mint regulation) restore the balance, except, Whoops, Dow Chemical owns the newspapers and the Congressmen who changed the tort laws in Dow Chemical's favor, even though Dow Chemical would NEVER do that because it's not in their long-term best interests as a corporation in our Libertarian Utopia"".

Beat in eggs and vanilla until creamy.      3 In medium bowl, mix together flour, baking soda and salt. Gradually blend into creamed mixture.      4 Stir in mini chocolate chips and chopped nuts, if using.      5 Drop from small spoon onto ungreased cookie sheet. Bake 10 to 12 minutes until golden brown.      Makes about 6 dozen cookies.  We've only ever used margarine though, not shortening. You can probably use butter if you want as well. The key here is to make sure that the butter/margarine/fat/whatever is cold when you make the cookies, and make sure that the cookies aren't pressed super flat - they will flatten out as they cook.  They are done when they are browned around the edges.  Also, try not to eat the whole bowl of cookie dough - you won't get any cookies!  The cookie dough should be the consistency of playdough. :)",®

Other than the consumer account schedule for fees, I don't see any reference to those account types on Schwab.com; they may have been retired.  &gt;The Schwab Bank **High Yield Investor Checking**® (“High  Yield Investor Checking”) account is a Schwab Bank  checking account linked to a corresponding Schwab  One® brokerage account (“Schwab One® account”)  maintained at Schwab Brokerage. The linked accounts  allow you to move funds between your High Yield Investor Checking account and your Schwab One®  account. Fees applicable to your Schwab One® account  are listed in the booklet entitled Charles Schwab Pricing  Guide for Individual Investors, which you received when  you opened your Schwab One® account. The **High Yield Investor Checking** account allows you to earn a variable rate of interest on funds you keep on deposit. You also receive a Schwab Bank Visa® Platinum Check  Card and unlimited checkwriting privileges.   &gt;We do not charge any fees for use of any ATM  machine. If you use a machine that is not a Schwab  Bank ATM, you may be charged a fee by the ATM  operator or any network used. This may include a fee  for a balance inquiry even if you do not complete a  withdrawal or other monetary transaction  Alright, now for the important part: &gt;For the following accounts, we offer a rebate on fees assessed by others for ATM cash withdrawals, for the first six transactions, up to a total of $9 per Statement Period  &gt;*(high yield checking not listed)*  &gt;**For the following accounts, we refund fees charged by ATM operators when you use your Schwab Bank  Check Card for ATM cash withdrawals**. The rebate will  appear as a lump-sum credit on the same checking  account periodic statement that includes ATM fees  incurred for that account statement cycle.  &gt;* **High Yield Investor Checking**  I have High Yield Investor Checking and both the text above &amp; calling Schwab yielded the same results. I asked if for my checking account # (1234....) I could visit an ATM 10 times in Vegas with a ($15 fee and get fully refunded), the rep laughed and told me yes, and that if I go overseas all ATM fees for cash withdrawal are refunded  as well (however, fees for other services, such as purchasing postage or getting a balance inquiry printed, are not; as long as you just withdraw cash and get your reciept, you're refunded).",®

I've had plenty of people crop my images to remove logos, or remove something I believe to be vital to the look/style/feel of the photo.  It's highly frustrating.  It's a catch.

I often can get sliced deli meat behind the counter for less per pound than the packaged Oscar Mayer/Hormel crap.

t5_2qh03,theeponym,1321409723,"Sorry, but I'm gonna have to rain on this Glorious PC Gaming Master Race™ parade.  This UI, as intended for its primary target, is *great*. It's not perfect, but it's praise-worthy. And given the current state of UIs in some games (MW3, I'm looking at you), it's nothing short of jaw-dropping.  While I will concede that it's flawed when it comes to mice, given that's it's still *very usable* and that it's meant for controllers (sorry guys, 86% of sales are consoles so suck it up), all of this whining is unwarranted. Doubly so because The Glorious PC Gaming Master Race™ loves to customize their stuff anyway. Could the devs have optimized it for PC users? Absolutely. But it's a hard sell to make when only a small fraction will ever see it, even less will complain and even fewer still will stick with it (instead of using some mod).  &gt; 1, Not making good use of screen real estate  Sorry, this isn't a basic rule of UI design. There is no direct correlation between space usage and effectiveness. And to quickly demonstrate why maximizing space usage can be a **bad** idea, let's look at an example from Typography 101.  [Readability Example](http://i.imgur.com/ZZU3r.png)  Here we have a large body of text, presented in two layouts. (A) uses a shorter measure and thus takes up nearly two pages. (B) uses a full page measure and thus can fit all of the text in the one page.  You would be tempted to say, ""Hey look, (B) is better. It saves paper and ink and I don't have to flip a page. So it's clearly better."" But guess what? You'll read (A) quicker and easier than you would (B).  &gt; 2, Requiring too many user actions to reach information &gt; 3, Putting crucial information 'below the fold' (so it requires scrolling to reach)  You strike me as somebody who likes to champion web design clichés (and lies) that things should only be x-number of clicks deep and users don't scroll.  The fact of the matter is Skyrim's information hierarchy is very shallow. It doesn't take ""too many actions"" to get anywhere. It's been purposefully made very shallow to speed up the console experience, which lacks things like keyboard shortcuts. And scrolling isn't a ""step"". Scrolling isn't an information layer in a user's mental model (with some exceptions).  Here's a little secret: I've never played an elder scrolls game before. And within 30 seconds (tops) of opening the menu for the first time, I knew where *everything* was and how to do anything. It was immediately comfortable and informative enough to be useful.  **Skyrim's Inventory Screen**   &gt; I am a list of only 9 items yet still require scrolling   This is a valid example from a mousing perspective. But is irrelevant when using directional selection.   &gt; Too thin / I take up only 1/5th the screen / I am a long angular column that maximizes tedious scrolling / Should be spread out so no scrolling is necessary   There's a number of things here that you seem to be overlooking. First and foremost is resolution flexibility. The amount of ""wasted space"" is rather contextual to the user. And the size of the column doesn't *need* to be any wider. One item per line (no text wrapping). Perfect. The column has no functional reason to be wider.   And I can't for the life of me understand how you think the scrolling is tedious, but a grid like Morrowind's is not. Having a single column, alphabetical list is about as easy to **scan** as it gets. The iPod isn't dead simple for even a grandmother by accident. The grid system you so loudly champion is terrible for this reason: it's not half as easy to scan. With a grid like that, I'm forced to:  • scan in two directions, not one  • have to guess/remember which row/column something is in  • have to guess/remember which page it's on  • guess that an item I'm looking for is what I want before hovering/clicking to confirm   &gt; No images used, just labels. The addition of an icon would make finding what you want faster. A picture says a thousand words.   A picture says a thousand words. An icon says almost none. And either way, a picture says a thousand *different* words to different people.  The vast majority of icons do not convey information pictorally. They convey *location* of an action. People don't memorize what icons look like, they memorize where they were. There's a well known experiment where the toolbar of an extremely well-known application was re-arranged (same icons, just moved) and it nearly crippled every user. But that same toolbar, with completely changed icons (same position) was adapted to right away.  Icons do not convey information like you believe they do. And an icon-heavy, text-less grid like the Morrowind interface is awful. And impossible for a non-mouse interaction. And either way, do you really expect icons to be useful in a list of 100+ ingredients? Do you really think a meaningful distinction can be made between ""Weed X"" and ""Thistle X"".  &gt; Equipped items should jump automatically to the top of a list   This would only be desirable if an *alias* was placed there, or if it were referenced in a secondary list. The actual item as it belongs to the rest of the list, must stay put. Ever used a website where the navigation links would re-arrange based on what page you were on? It was downright awful, no? Imagine experimenting/looking for things and they keep moving on you.   &gt; The selection arrows are not conspicuous enough   Right, the only non-text, graphical element in the column doesn't stand out. Know what isn't conspicuous enough? Which of the filters is active in the Morrowind screen.  &gt; See yourself during item selection  There's a good reason to have something like this and I do agree something of that nature should've been included. But your suggestion would not be an improvement. First and foremost, item selection to ""see"" it on you is something you don't care about in the heat of battle—which is probably the majority of the time you'll be in the menu. Mid-combat, if I bring up my menu to change something, I still want to see what foes are in front of me. So seeing yourself has to be an *optional* view, not the default.  Secondly, the motivation to see what you have/haven't equipped is not satisfied properly this way. If you're looking for information conveyance, a fully dressed person doesn't tell you much. It certainly doesn't tell you the breakdown of the items (i.e. how many different things you can wear). A good example would be armour, which as I understand is now simpler in the number of pieces vs Oblivion. But you wouldn't know that by seeing your character model. What you really need is something like Diablo's breakdown that shows the slots that can be equipped.   &gt; most of the time the player does not know what effects are active   I agree that the magic information is over simplified. Nothing's made inaccessible or hidden, but it doesn't offer a quick path to status. The list isn't the issue per se. It's that there's no general ""status"" screen somewhere/somehow.   If I had any real gripe with this UI, it's that there's no centralized aggregation of all the separate bits of information. No quick overlay that I open from any screen that shows where I'm at, what I'm wearing and what effects are present.  In the end, that's what this post really is about. The original critique was attacking the spokes, when in reality it should've been asking why there was no hub. The existing screens aren't the problem. It's the missing screen.",™

t5_2qxih,doctoreldritch,1321413480,"&gt; So does this mean that one might pre-order but not get into early release?  Sounds like probably not (ie, you won't get left hanging), based on the language used in their legal small text down at the bottom: ""Customers who pre-order Star Wars™: The Old Republic™ **will** be able to play the game before the official launch.""  Their FAQ says ""may,"" but probably mostly just to keep their butts covered in case it proves impossible to get everyone in; my interpretation overall is that their *plan* is to give everyone who pre-ordered at least 1 day of early access, but they don't want to be legally obligated if there are technical difficulties.   However, nobody knows yet (possibly including BioWare) how they're intending to parcel out the ""up to 5 days,"" exactly, so if you pre-ordered fairly late, don't count on more than 1 day of early release.  You might get more, of course, but don't count on it.",™

The difference in appearance between dull and shiny is due to the foil manufacturing process. In the final rolling step, two layers of foil are passed through the rolling mill at the same time. The side coming in contact with the mill's highly polished steel rollers becomes shiny. The other side, not coming in contact with the heavy rollers, comes out with a dull or matte finish. The exception is when using Reynolds Wrap® Release® Non-Stick Aluminum Foil. The non-stick coating is applied during manufacturing to the dull side of the foil. Always place the non-stick (dull) side toward the food.   ",®

AWESOME.  One of the first things I ever tried to make with Daiya tapioca-based cheese--These quesadillas are SO good! Such a quick and easy recipe.  What you'll need:  • Small whole wheat tortillas  • Daiya mozzarella-style cheese shreds (or Daiya Pepperjack-style cheese shreds ♥)  • Daiya cheddar-style cheese shreds  • 1-2 cans black beans  • 1-2 cups brown rice  • 1-2 small onions, chopped  • 1-2 cups green bell pepper, chopped (optional)  • Taco Bell Fire Sauce (Sriracha sauce also works great!)  • Tofutti sour cream  Cook rice. Heat up black beans with chopped onions and chopped green peppers (if desired) on medium setting in skillet/pot or in a Crockpot until heated through. Next, lay down one tortilla and spoon desired amount of bean, rice, and onion/pepper mixture into the center, leaving about a 1-inch margin around the outside. Sprinkle cheese along the outer edge of the tortilla (this allows the cheese to melt and seal the edges so the filling doesn't dump out) and over top of the beans and rice. Add an evenly-spread amount of hot sauce (I like to either use 2 to 3 packets of Fire Sauce or a generous amount of Sriracha) and lay another tortilla on top. Press down to secure. Brown both sides of the quesadilla on medium-high heat in skillet until the cheese is fully melted. Done! Quick and easy! I also like to add chopped seitan that has been cooked in taco seasoning sometimes.  Best when served with yummy Tofutti sour cream on the side. ♥  Makes 4-6 servings.",♥

Then Miyamoto-san said that Mario Kart 7 doesn't get blurry. I took a look, and it really didn't. I wondered why and came to understand it was because the player's kart was placed in a location where there is no binocular parallax. While driving, the players are looking at their own kart, so it doesn't look blurry. So what will people be looking at in Super Mario 3D Land?

Shop Now.  www.levi.com Why Men Lose Attraction   10 Ugly Mistakes Women Make That Ruins Any Chances Of A Relationship  CatchHimAndKeepHim.com It is very important that we dress well and look presentable everyday. Even if we wouldn't like it to be that way, first impressions are quite frequently the last impressions. Take a very simple example. You go to a cafe to meet a guy for the first time. The first thing you notice when you set your eyes on him is what he is wearing. What is he wearing? Is he properly dressed? Are the clothes in vogue? Are they well coordinated? It is the same case when we go on an interview. Guys should wear neatly polished shoes, ironed pants and prim shirts. Girls should see to it that their footwear and bag are well coordinated and goes with the outfit. The files, folders we carry, and the papers within them, should not have dog-ears.   This might be quite a daunting aspect for those of you who have a tight budget. How can you possibly afford to spend all your money on just one dress or one bag, or one pair of jeans? Well, here is the good news - you don't have to. One can look equally well-dressed by having to dish out a lot less money, and I am here to tell you how to do that. Find out how to dress well on a tight budget as you read on...  6 Sassy Tips!  Quite contrary to the popular belief, dressing well on a tight budget is absolutely possible. All it needs is a little bit of planning, and the correct information. Here are 6 sassy tips on how to dress well on a tight budget.  1] Store Brands Store brands offer a range of clothing apparel and at much cheaper rates than high fashion brands. You would be saving a lot of money if you go in for such brands. Store brands usually offer something I like to call practical and affordable fashion. The styling of the clothes is pretty good. Most importantly, they are good on the pocket. Alfani (store brand of Macy's), NOBO i.e. No Boundaries (store brand of Walmart) are some such examples. Good quality fashion at affordable prices is what you will find at such stores.  Tip: Take a market survey and find out which are the best store brands available around your place. Pay a visit to as many as you can before you start picking stuff - you do not want to spend money on something you half liked only to discover something else in a different store that you like much more! Remember, you are on a tight budget.  2] Discounts and Sales Make the most of discounts and sales when different stores and brands come up with them. The 'Sale' period is when you can get a really good bargain on the high fashion brands. However, chances are that even with discount, some brands may exceed your budget. The best thing to do at such times is to be prepared. Save up some cash so that you can spend it on such sales.   Tip: Keep a tab on the different high fashion brands around your place and when they have sales. A good way to do that would be to subscribe to (or lend from the local library) some good fashion magazines. Usually big brands announce their sales in magazines or in the newspapers. Keep your eyes open!  3] Modify Who said just because clothes are old you have to dish them out? With a little bit of creativity (and a little bit of help from a fashion designer friend, if you have one) you can revamp your old clothes and make them look brand new! You can even buy plain clothes and modify them to suit your taste. Flea markets would be a good place to look at for knick-knacks to modify your clothes - beads, strings, scarves, anything. Here is one idea: you can take an old shirt and stitch hoops on the sides. Hang a beaded belt in it, and you have a chic new shirt!  Tip: Study different clothes crafted by fashion designers and try to understand their styles. Try to think of suitable replacements and adapt the same style in your own clothes. It will also serve to boost your creativity. Begin with a plain dress and jazz it up with sequins. An old pair of jeans can be cut to give you cropped pants or capris. Think MAD!  4] Fast Fashion One of the biggest advantages of fast fashion brands is that they are affordable. They do not compromise on the style and fashion in any way in their bid to be affordable. So fast fashion could be a good go-between for dressing well on a tight budget. Zara is one of the leading fast fashion brands. If you take a look at their catalog or even take a tour of their website, you will be amazed at the different styles and fabrics they offer, at prices that make your wallet smile! Give it a thought.   Tip: Fast fashion sells like hot pancakes! So make sure to visit the store regularly so that you get the best pick on all different kinds of apparel. It would be a good idea to take a look at the websites of different fast fashion brands to have a cost-comparative account with you.  5] Capsule Wardrobe The ultimate solution to dressing well on a tight budget would be to maintain a capsule wardrobe. A capsule wardrobe has all the essential types of apparels, but in such colors and patterns that they can be very easily and efficiently mixed and matched with each other so that you get a new look every time. The best thing about a capsule wardrobe is that it cures shopaholism! You would be surprised at the number of different looks you can work up with only a set number of different clothes - try it! It is amazing.  Tip: Work out the different kinds of clothes that you like to wear, the clothes you wear the most, etc. before you go shopping for your capsule wardrobe. The capsule wardrobe of a teenager, a college student, a businesswoman, a working mom and a housewife would all be different. So plan and execute.   6] Design Your Own This would be the best kind of tip I could ever give you if you are interested in fashion designing or are already a student of fashion designing. There can be nothing as cheap and as creatively satisfying as designing your own clothes. You get your own raw material. You design your own clothes. You wear them. You flaunt them! Your dressing style and wardrobe would hence be very unique, and it would have a characteristic flavor, as it would consist of designs all coming out of your own head. What's more, if your family and friends like what you wear, you could soon start your own store or something, right from your own backyard! Designing clothes could hence turn from a hobby to a source of income.  Tip: If you are not a professional fashion designer or a student of fashion designing, take the time to read up a few good books about the basics of tailoring. Learn the different techniques, the tips and tricks of the trade. When you begin with your first garment, make sure you do not splurge on the material. Begin with simple inexpensive stuff, gain the confidence and then move on to more ambitious projects.  Dressing well on a tight budget is not as difficult as it may seem. You need some time to plan things, some more time to make appropriate surveys, and then some time to actually go and shop. The best part is you need very little cash! One final tip I would like to give is - whatever you do, never buy fake clothes! People may not give a second thought to your store brand clothes probably, but wear a 'Lee Pooper' jeans, or carry a 'GUGGI' bag, and people are going to rolls their eyes and mock you! Never do it. Hope the above tips will help you look stylish, smart and sexy without emptying your bank account! Have fun! /www.topstar-nb.com /is my web site",®

This is so good. ♥   What you'll need:  • 8 oz. seitan, chopped into small pieces  • 5 to 6 large potatoes, chopped into 1-inch cubes  • 1 to 2 cups carrots, chopped into small pieces  • 1-2 onions, diced  • 1 cup corn  • 1 cup peas (optional)  • 1/2 cup celery, chopped (optional)  • 1 cup vegetable broth  • cilantro  • garlic powder  • pepper  • corn starch  • 9-inch whole wheat pie/pastry crust (or make your own)  Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Line baking dish with one of the pastry crusts and poke holes in it, baking it for 10 minutes.  Then, fry up the seitan until it's good and browned and set aside in a bowl.  In a large skillet in a small amount of vegetable oil, soften the potatoes, carrots, and onion for a few minutes on medium-high heat.  Add seitan to the pan.  Next, add vegetable broth and spices.  Stir well, cooking for a few minutes before adding vegetables of your choice (corn, peas, celery, green beans, chopped spinach, etc.).  Add some corn starch to thicken up the broth, and once it gets to desired filling consistency, pour into baking dish and cover with the other pastry crust, again poking holes in it.  Seal the edges, pressing with a fork.  Bake for 45 minutes, or until crust is golden brown.",♥

Tangerines are fairly thin-skinned and most zesters go all the way through, so I usually do it with my paring knife.  Wash and then halve your tangerine, squeeze the juice out and then cut the zest from the pith (the white bit inside the orange skin) afterwards.  I can usually get good-sized strips and then I slice them into riny ribbons.  The blood orange has a bit thicker skin, so you can either use a zester or do it manually.  Add juice and zest to the pot.  Wash your apple or pear and dice into approx 1/4"" pieces with the skin on.  add to the pot.  Finally, put all the other ingredients in (spices, salt, sugars, booze*) and simmer for about 45 minutes to an hour.  Keep in mind that it will be appear to be bit thinner on the heat, than it will actually turn out to be after it cools down and sets up.  If it gets too thick pull it off the heat and add a little water until it's thickened back up.  Be sure to warn people about the sliced ginger so they don't try eating them.  :)  *Be careful when adding the booze.  It can catch fire.

As far as whether they pay more than they take out, it would certainly go on a case-by-case basis as it would for any resident of the U.S. Getting more out of the govt than one pays in is a signal of one's socioeconomic status, not of one's immigration status. I know many citizens on welfare, and many undocumented immigrants who have worked their way into Fortune 500 companies.  Keep in mind, too, that every student--whether legal citizen or undocumented immigrant--takes more out of the system than they put in. That's just how it works. In each case, though, those who can will pay back for that education through a lifetime of hard work. For them to put more into the system than they take out though their education, we have to allow them to be more than busboys and farmhands once they graduate. Hence the DREAM Act.  Every wave of immigrants, from the Chinese and Japanese to the Italians and Irish have been viewed as leaches and lowlifes. Each group, though, was allowed to reach for the American Dream™ and rise past their socioeconomic status to become white-collar workers and business owners. For some reason, though, ever since the 50s with [Operation Wetback](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Wetback), we have been unable to allow Hispanics to do the same; at least not without meeting great and constant resistance.  But, to answer your question; statistically speaking and on average, do immigrants pay in more than they take out? Probably not, but only because we do not allow it.",™

t5_2qh33,rampant_elephant,1321646739,"So, the company asks some politicians whether they can use a marketing phrase; the politicians check with some scientists and they say:  &gt; Following an application from Prof. Dr. Moritz Hagenmeyer and Prof. Dr. Andreas Hahn, submitted pursuant to Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 via the Competent Authority of Germany, the Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies was asked to deliver an opinion on the scientific substantiation of a health claim related to water and reduced risk of development of dehydration and of concomitant decrease of performance. The scope of the application was proposed to fall under a health claim referring to disease risk reduction. The food, water, which is the subject of the health claim, is sufficiently characterised. The claimed effect is “regular consumption of significant amounts of water can reduce the risk of development of dehydration and of concomitant decrease of performance”. The target population is assumed to be the general population. The Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 defines reduction of disease risk claims as claims which state that the consumption of a food “significantly reduces a risk factor in the development of a human disease”. Thus, for reduction of disease risk claims, the beneficial physiological effect results from the reduction of a risk factor for the development of a human disease. The Panel notes that dehydration was identified as the disease by the applicant. Dehydration is a condition of body water depletion. The Panel notes that the proposed risk factors, “water loss in tissues” or “reduced water content in tissues”, are measures of water depletion and thus are measures of the disease. The Panel considers that the proposed claim does not comply with the requirements for a disease risk reduction claim pursuant to Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006. © European Food Safety Authority, 2011  **TLDR** Article 14 says the product must reduce risk factors for a disease, Profs can't think of a risk factor.

Everyone in our neighboring departments knew it.  [I wanted him to know it.](http://i.imgur.com/Nu3uc.jpg)  So, I had recently bought a couple [Phantom Keystrokers](http://www.thinkgeek.com/gadgets/electronic/ae83/) from Thinkgeek.  These clever little devices act as HID interfaces (mouse/keyboard) and do three things: toggle caps-lock, shift the cursor around a little and type some pre-loaded text.  The frequency of these can be modified from 5 seconds to 15 minutes, though in practice that turned out to be about 2 minutes.  It was good enough for my purposes.  Now, after testing it out on my machine to see what the user experience would be like I determined that the cursor wiggling and typing would be too overt, so I turned those off and only had it toggle caps-lock.  Bossman had one of those fancy monitors that has a USB hub built in to it and somehow had figured out how to connect it to the dock he used for his laptop.  He didn't actually use the ports on this monitor, but it was still attached.  I slapped my new best friend into one of the ports, [admired my handiwork](http://i.imgur.com/F7IOx.png) and left.  Every couple weeks I'd poke my head back there to see if it was in place and sure enough, it always was.  It blended in so perfectly with the plastic on the monitor that unless you had the notion to turn the monitor around to stare in the exact spot where it was plugged in, you just wouldn't see it at all.  A couple months later I'm in Bossman's office to have a one-on-one with him and he's finishing up an email or something.  I notice a big bright-green **CAPS ON** flash up on his screen and scarcely missing a beat, his pinky finger flashes out and hits the caps-lock key.  **CAPS OFF**  [He lets out an exasperated sigh and starts dumping his frustrations about his Logitech keyboard and how he has reloaded the drivers and software for it and he just doesn't understand what the problem might be.

That being said, there were three big things that I think made Losira lose that game:  1. Losira was bleeding brood lords throughout the game. When you aren't more than 2 bases ahead of the Terran, which he wasn't at the time, these sort of loses add up.  2. Losira let the MMM switch do too much damage to him before he was able to switch unit compositions correctly. He also didn't get Mutas out again, and the current metagame dictates that ling/bling/muta is the correct counter to MMM. Infestors do a lot of damage, but between losing Infestros, the added cost of infestors, and the delay between fungal growths, Losira just couldn't keep up.  As an ex-zerg, I ♥ Losira, and I'm definitely rooting for him to win the next few games.",♥

t5_2qh03,AptMoniker,1321747028,"Although I don't see a new console coming out, as devil's advocate, here's a scenario. When the 360 came out, a big part of the selling point was backwards compatibility. In terms of where we are with what I call DLC thinking &amp; pandering, it's not entirely impossible that the release of a Halo ""720"" version that ""OMG looks better than the 360 version and can only be accessed by purchasing a new console and oh yeah, by-the-way, you now don't have enough money for anything playstation...."" But at least you can stiiiiill play your 360 games! And all your previous stats and information will simply transfer over using Cloud-X® (made up). You see, DLC is less about providing a new experience as it is exploiting/guilting/pandering to the fans just enough so that you'll bite. The thing is, DLC has become so profitable, that it's turning into a game model (ie. MW3). What worse? It's also a model which will breach into the console itself. Obviously, new technology comes around, right? So it makes sense. But what about the instances where it doesn't make sense? The catch is, IT'S A OLD IDEA. BOTH xbox's have had controller upgrades. Each one has less/more affordable versions and themed versions. I actually work for a digital design agency right now, and this is the type of things we come up with. When you think about it, it could happen. Probability? I'm leaning towards exactly what you're saying. They're going to launch when there are titles to flaunt.

t5_2r4w1,legendary_ironwood,1321755886,"Sure. (Keep in mind that all of this is from a layman's perspective, as I have no design background. Sorry if it seems like a bit much )  * some pages are unnecessarily long , a couple have a big block of nothing at the bottom (fencing and college, e.g.)   * the ""Welcome!"" seems a bit tacky, same with ""fencing, college, and you!"" All text that is in that position should be put below the Hub City Fencing Academy logo, either centered or left justified. When it is to the right of the logo, is distracting and in a funny place  * the web address is for the home page: http://www.hubcityfencing.com/Hub_City_Fencing_Academy/Hub_City_Fencing.html  that's kinda long, especially for the home page. I'm sure you can trim it down to something more visually appealing  * when I view the site in chrome, I get [this](http://imgur.com/a/FCT0m#0) for some reason. It looks fine in firefox. (look at the other suggestions in the album)  * the ""Find Us On Facebook"" box is a little awkwardly positioned on the home page, I would consider just getting rid of it and replacing it with a simple link to your facebook page  * you ""Links"" section is also awkwardly positioned and vague. Some links direct you to another website and some are links for your website. The ""about us"" link, for example, should be more prominently placed. I'd say you should have a separate page and call it something like ""additional links.""  * the home page seems a bit cluttered, you have a text box labeled ""about us"" and a link for ""about us"", e.g. . Just keep the home page super simple.  * it might be just me, but I find there to be too many columns throughout. there is a lot of looking back and forth on the screen for information  * throw in a nice picture of the outside of your facility somewhere  * if it was me, I'd move the toolbar on the top to the side for improved navigation. If you can, have a drop-down menu appear (like on amazon.com) when you hover over a link. That may clean things up. The links would be (from top to bottom) Home, About us, Why Fence [to be combined with the college section], Our Coaches, Membership Classes &amp; Fees, Fencing Camp, Birthday Parties, Additional Links, Hours &amp; Location, Contact Us. A link could be labeled ""Why Fence?"" and when hovered over ""Fencing &amp; College"" and ""Health Benefits"" could drop down, for example. Might not be a great example, but you get the idea.    * Or maybe a combination of sidebar and top bar. I think that the site logo should be above the links, but that might be a my own preference.  * membership and classes page - it's quite long and should be made more concise. make it so you don't have to scroll all the way down to know what each course you offer is, the ""General Scheduling and Pricing"" surprised me, it didn't look like a link. more tables and charts, less prose   * the site seems a little dark in some places, takes away from the chreey vibe i can tell you'r going for. the contact us page, for example. Very dark text is used on the message box. But then the directions part becomes a large white box all of the sudden, unlike anywhere else on the site.   * reduce the amount of photos in the gallery and get them more varied, maybe bunch them into galleries of when they were taken  * i'd throw a footer at the bottom like the one on reddit that says ""[contact us] - © 2011 HCPA inc. All rights reserved."" or whatever, just something to neatly end every page ",©

t5_2qh16,bluestargalaxy4,1321770073,"No I don't think it's arrogant, and yes I do have a narrow understanding of how the brain works. Scientists know a lot about the composition of the brain and have machines that can detect large portions of brain activity. But it doesn't go much further than that when we're talking about consciousness and thought. There's no way to track the path of neurons talking to each other. There's 100 billion neurons in the brain that we can't keep track of. That's a lot of things we don't know. The brain is too complex right now to know a lot about it. We're not there yet. Here's an interesting fact to further prove my point: We know Adderall makes ADHD people focus better, but scientists don't really know why it works. They have theories on why it works, but they don't know for sure. So there they are, scientists not knowing how Adderall works, and here we are talking about knowing when A.I. is going to be a reality in 20 years. Give me a break... We're at the tip of the iceberg in understanding the human brain and no I don't think that that's an overstatement.  Edit: If you don't believe me, take a look at [how Adderall works here.](http://www.adultadhd.net/adderall/) ""Although it is not known exactly how Adderall® works."" And on [Wikipedia here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adderall) ""It is **thought to work** by increasing the amount of dopamine and norepinephrine in the brain."" Anti-depressants are another example of this. Take a look at this [Zoloft commercial.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vfSFXKlnO0&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=20s) ""**While the cause is unknown**, depression **may be** related to an imbalance of natural chemicals between nerve cells in the brain.""",®

t5_2qhek,TX1138,1321775615,"&gt;His resolutions are lazy and riddled with contradictions  If this was in any way going to 'kill this show' as you claim, then it already would have under RTD's time, whose resolutions were almost always pulled out of his backside at the last second, often completely killing any of the tension built up over the episode. I'm specifically referring to scenes like Pete/Mickey/Jackie being able to teleport just in time to save Rose/Sarah Jane from the Void/Daleks, God!Rose, the MagicVoidVacuum™, Floaty-Glowing Messiah Doctor, the Doctor-Donna's 'magical keyboard' solution to the Reality Bomb that serves only to reduce both Davros and the Daleks to a laughing stock, Donna's unintentionally hilarious mind-explosion powers that adds nothing to the plot and raises a huge number of safety concerns, and the previously unhinted-at third target that allows the plot to resolve itself without the Doctor being forced to make any moral judgement call whatsoever from *The End of Time* are all symptoms of a writer who again and again has proved himself unable to produce a satisfactory resolution.  Claims that Moffat's resolutions are in any way 'lazy' are just silly. I'd argue that Moffat tends to lays out a strong, cohesive plot, with elements that all tie together in order to create a satisfying resolution. For instance, A Christmas Carol sets out a number of key plot points;  * There is crippled Star Cruiser that needs saving from dangerous fog. * The planet is inhabited by fish that swim in this fog. * There is a flying shark that has swallowed part of the Doctor's sonic. * The fog is controlled by Kazran's weather machine using sonic waves. * Abigail's singing resonates with the ice-crystals that make up the fog.  All these parts, entertaining in their own right, go on to form the resolution to the story. I'd argue that the solution to the universe collapsing at the end of Series 5 was a bit out of left-field and could have used a bit more foreshadowing, but I have absolutely no problems with the resolution to the Doctor's 'death' at the end of Series 6. There was plenty of foreshadowing, had a place in the narrative *prior* to its use as the solution, slotted in well with the recurring themes throughout the season and made perfect sense in the greater context of the narrative. I'd probably argue that it's the *best* finale resolution since the revival.  &gt;The only way you can be ""surprised"" by a reveal in Series 5 or 6 is if you have the mind of a six year old or are just incredibly stupid.  And the only way someone could criticise Moffat for being 'unsubtle', 'lazy', writing 'sub-par' stories, and claiming that these things will 'kill the series' when RTD, the man who brought the show to unprecedented levels of popularity, is equally guilty of these traits (if not more so) is if they were lying to themselves.",™

I'd say Moffat's lows are similar to RTD's mediums, while RTD's lows are ones we'd like to forget even exist (Fear Her, ugh). I think what frustrates me with Moffat's stories are that the good ones are amazing, and so when we are given a story that isn't as good, it's frustrating because we know what the show is capable of.  &gt;I'm specifically referring to scenes like Pete/Mickey/Jackie being able to teleport just in time to save Rose/Sarah Jane from the Void/Daleks, God!Rose, the MagicVoidVacuum™, Floaty-Glowing Messiah Doctor, the Doctor-Donna's 'magical keyboard' solution to the Reality Bomb that serves only to reduce both Davros and the Daleks to a laughing stock, Donna's unintentionally hilarious mind-explosion powers that adds nothing to the plot and raises a huge number of safety concerns, and the previously unhinted-at third target that allows the plot to resolve itself without the Doctor being forced to make any moral judgement call whatsoever from The End of Time are all symptoms of a writer who again and again has proved himself unable to produce a satisfactory resolution.  I agree with you on Floaty-Glowing Messiah Doctor (which I still don't understand), the Doctor-Donna's 'magical keyboard' solution, and Donna's unintentionally hilarious mind-explosion powers. The Torchwood time lock is another thing that comes to mind that just pops out of nowhere. And not only were these out of nowhere, but it reduced the seriousness of a major threat that had been looming the entire episode.   However, in your other examples, I was perfectly okay with them. I don't think you need to have everything be foreshadowed or hinted at way ahead of time. Sometimes it works well, other times it doesn't. The times when it became an issue was when RTD had a greater goal than telling the story. But that's just me, I don't really look for that too much. You seem to have a deeper analysis of these episodes.   My biggest issue with the finale in series 6 was that he raised such a huge question of how to prevent the doctor from dying, and although the Teselecta is able to pull off all of the technicalities involved with rescuing the doctor, it almost felt like a cop-out. The theory of a duplicate was probably the most common one thrown around throughout the series. To me personally, I expected more. It may have been the best resolution in terms of context, it seemed like the easy answer. Even if it had been Moffat's plan from the beginning,  considering the Teselecta was introduced halfway through the season, it didn't really feel like it. I guess in the end, after struggling with this problem of the doctor dying for the whole season, for it to be so predictable was a let down. Once I saw the Teselecta in TWORS, I was hoping for the rest of the episode that it wasn't the answer to the problem, but I was disappointed.   At this point, I'm not even sure if what I'm typing is relevant anymore. It's 4 am. I should have slept hours ago and now I'm just rambling. ",™

The length of a game of StarCraft varies greatly from 10 minutes for a bo3 to 1 hour for a single game. MLG has to estimate how long a series is going to take (I think they use 1 hour for a bo3). If they give match more time the next match is more likely to be on time because there is a bigger margin for the transfer. But if they make it too long people are going to complain about crowd shots.  Conclusion: shut the fuck up and make some coffee ♥",♥

This is a blatent *lie*. There are plenty of references to the classic era in the Moffat era; more so than what we got under RTD. Hell, six seconds into his era we get a reference to Pertwee, which has to be some sort of back-referencing record for a new showrunner. There are, however, less references to the RTD era, which given the overload of RTD characters in *Journey's End* and *The End of Time*, can only be a good thing.  &gt;Guess what? MOAR RIVER SONG EVERY OTHER EPISODE.  Replace 'River Song' with 'Rose', and again you'd have the RTD era down to a tee.  &gt; RTD at the very least laid clues and hints as to what the end game of each Series was going to be. Bad Wolf, The Missing Planets, Torchwood, Saxon, etc. He put the answers to what the finale would be all over in plain sight without EVER focusing in on them and blatantly telling us, ""Hey see this? It's important. Remember this.""  Are you being serious? RTD's Series 2 arc was completely-TORCHWOOD-in-TORCHWOOD-your-TORCHWOOD-face-TORCHWOOD-about-TORCHWOOD-it. And the Bad Wolf arc has to be the biggest let-down of the series so far. The words 'Bad Wolf' turned out to be just that; words! They had no real meaning or purpose beyond just happening to be the words closest to MagicGod!Rose™ when she sends them back in time. Coupled with Rose's ludicrous leap of logic when she somehow couples the words 'Bad Wolf' to 'I can somehow go forward in time to save the Doctor despite all evidence to the contrary', the resolution seems forced and contrived. The less said about its bizarre, in-your-face appearance at the end of Turn Left, the better.  &gt;He stripped away the danger of death which leaves nothing for our characters to be worried about anyway because somehow there's ways around even HUMAN companions dying.   Again, RTD had just as much of a problem with 'death', and the show *exploded* under his run. Rose is going to die? NOPE JUST TRAPPED IN A CONVENIENT PLOT DEVICE WHICH SHE'LL LATER ESCAPE FROM WITH NO EXPLANATION. Donna is going to die? NOPE JUST HAD HER MEMORIES WIPED NOW SHE'S NO LONGER A USEFUL PLOT DEVICE. The Doctor is going to die? NOPE JUST GOING TO REGENERATE AND CONTINUE LIVING DESPITE RTD'S ATTEMPT TO CHARACTERISE IT OTHERWISE.  &gt;LOL! Have The Doctor being a one-note 'this is cool now!' pony""  Another bizzare misrepresentation of what happens on-screen. You are entirely right, however, to claim that this argument is going nowhere. Your irrational hatred of Moffat and bizarre scaremongering about how he is going to 'kill' the show despite all evidence to the contrary I find utterly baffling.",™

t5_2qn70,kamins89,1321847778,"Hey I’m a liberal from Europe who supports social democracy. I know, the devil himself. Here is how I would answer your questions (sorry for vague answers I don’t have much time right now). It’s my own opinion, others might think I am crazy and what not ☺, hope it helps:   1.	High taxes alone don’t create jobs, never did. However if you have good welfare programs that secure persons healthcare and education (the basics, that are considered a personal right in most of Europe) allows people to save more for their retirement and other needs. You don’t have to worry if you have saved enough money so that all your children could get college education, or , god forbid, if something terrible happened to your family and you lost your income. Furthermore your spending power increases, because despite paying higher taxes you are still left with significant amount of income that does not need to go to your savings.  2.	Single payer reduces the cost of healthcare because all pay a lower amount for their healthcare. It doesn’t matter if you’re sick or not. However if you get sick you are fully covered. Considering the revenues collected from all people and the costs needed for those who are sick everybody is covered. Furthermore, doctors can have private practice in order to do add to their income, although in developed countries it is not necessary as their salaries are one of the highest from all professions. Your understanding about European countries in wrong, the ones that are bankrupt are because they have no economy (no real industries, etc.) and spend too much compared to what their economy can produce. 3.	For energy I think nuclear is the future (you must be stupid not to thinks its green, one accident is a random occurrence not a trend), although renewable can also work. Consider Denmark. 4.	Individual rights are one thing, societal morals and norms are different. Let me take another example. Consider junk food. There’s a lot of noise about government wanting to tax fat and sugar. Of course conservatives argue that people should choose what they eat! Well obesity is already a huge problem Western Europe, and particularly US. Furthermore it adds up to costs of  healthcare and in turn people cant afford it.. you now the drill. Also, if you care so much about smoking pot than I should urge you to reconsider your priorities.  5.	Give money to the middle class. Since spending has multiplier effect you can collect more revenue over time (this is why you can actually spend yourself out of recession). Cuts are necessary, but not from entitlements. By taking them away you will make people save more, thus taking money out of the economy, which leads to slowdown in growth. If you want to cut, cut defense.  6.	It’s the start and general population views it as fair game. Probably the most important thing everybody needs to understand is that rich do not create jobs. Demand creates jobs. Nobody will work if there is no demand for the crap you’re selling.   7.	Compared to other developed countries US has very low taxes and almost no regulations. Company’s are leaving because they can pay much lower wages for unskilled work. In order to prevent that people have to get educated, i.e become skilled labor. Remember that most of the R&amp;D is still in US. Supply of skilled labor force is the future I think. (Bachelors degree has to become a new high school degree in order for US to lead the future. ).   I think the problem is that conservatives usually take things out of context and make them sound ridiculous. Everything has to work together. However, if you’re really interested in liberal governments read up on Sweden, Germany, Denmark. Remember that conservatives in Europe are democrats in US. US conservatives would be considered radical in Europe, the same as Social Democrats in US.  Sorry for poor English, it’s not my first language. ",☺

I've always felt that the 'Bad Wolf' arc was enormous let-down; all that build up for a simple predestination paradox was disappointing to say the least.   The fact that it turned out that the words 'Bad Wolf' were just 'words' didn't help at all. They had no real meaning or purpose beyond just happening to be the words closest to MagicGod!Rose™ when she sends them back in time. Coupled with Rose's ludicrous leap of logic when she somehow connects the words 'Bad Wolf' to 'I can somehow go forward in time to save the Doctor despite all evidence to the contrary', the resolution seems forced and contrived.  Its bizarre appearance at the end of *Turn Left* also made no sense, mostly due to the complete lack of follow-through or explanation in *The Stolen Earth*.",™

t5_2cneq,tpowers22,1321903825," The other evening I saw a wonderful documentary on Hugh Romney aka Wavy Gravy, and it got me to questioning as to why I harbor such an animosity against the Right-Wing of this country, and, since they are usually all Republicans, why I harbor such a deep dislike in general of the Republican Party. Firstly, let me say that I know now for certain that after being exposed to the way Wavy Gravy has lived his life of “protesting” for world peace and sanity that I am far from enlightened, and far from wise. Were I so, I would not have this abiding anger towards this political party.   I am a child of the 60’s. I grew up idolizing FDR and The New Deal. In that world, where all was far from perfect, government still managed by presidential and congressional action, to actually provide for the common good. Government was actually the guardian of the welfare of all its citizens, and government actually created jobs by the millions. I am an idealist, and, as the right-wing would label me, a bleeding Heart Liberal. I am proud to wear that union label. In my youth I had such high hopes for my country. I believed, as did my contemporaries, that peace in the world was an achievable dream, and that people, in this country at least, and perhaps in the whole world, could live in peace, free from want, from need, be educated, be productive…in short, I imagined what John Lennon imagined. In the 50’s, like others, I managed to not go to war in Korea, a war presided over by Democratic President Harry S, Truman I might add, realizing it was a part of the cold war’s trumped up “Domino Theory” and, as such, didn’t pass the smell test. It wasn’t my fight, and I believed that if the politicians thought that killing people in Korea was so important, they should strap on a rifle and go kill them themselves. It’s interesting to now see all the Korean products on our roads and shelves. In the 60’s I marched for peace, and was arrested in Washington D.C. protesting the Viet Nam war, and was part of a class-action lawsuit brought against the government for false arrest – which we won. So yes, in many ways this is an amazing country. But that was then, and this is now. Now the country I love is much less amazing. Now my constitution has been violated by people who’ve no clue as to its real intentions, and instead use it to further their mean-spirited agendas. Not only has peace not been achieved, but we now fight three wars at once, and the current Republican desired and designed wars in the Middle East, and their terrible waste of people and treasure, are ludicrous in their transparent lust for hegemony and oil - even as Republicans thwart every effort at alternative energy sources. Also, as far as “terrorism” is concerned, I’ve always thought it a job for Interpol - not whole armies. But of course Dick Cheney, he of Halliburton stock profits, would strongly disagree.  The case for where we now find ourselves as a country can be made against the Republican Right vis-a-vis the accumulated product of the callous, mean spirited, greed inspired, Right-Wing Republican policies over the course of the last half-century. If you check the statistics of job creation by Administration over the last 40 yrs you’ll find that the most jobs were created in descending order, by Johnson, Carter, Clinton, and Kennedy, and the least amount of jobs were created by Nixon, Reagan, Bush I, and, worst of all, Bush II. This alone speaks volumes as to where the Republican bread is buttered. I know that there is enough in this world for everyone never to go hungry, or go without shelter, or medical attention, or an education. Nor is there any rational reason for someone who wants to work to go without a job because they are uneducated or untrained. I know this. No one can tell me otherwise. And yet there are people in this country who think that providing whatever training, or education, or help, there is to all of us is somehow against the “spirit” of laissez-faire Capitalism. Against the “spirit” of the free market because, being the pirates that they are, they see the world as a dog eat dog place, and these same people profess without the least trace of irony, or shame, or embarrassment, to be Christians. This is surely a joke. Please understand, I have no quarrel with wealthy people who are not greedy, who are philanthropists, generous and giving of their time and money as many are. My brief is against the wealthy and connected who can never have enough, and who use their power and position to the detriment of the public at large. Witness their current attack on our working class. Of course, the poor never enter into their metric at all. How these people can bear to see so many in this country go without and continue in their selfish pursuit of power and money above all other things is obscene, and, to me anyway, convincing evidence that they are the most worthless humans among us, and worthy of my abject contempt. Of course these same Right Wing “Christians” who decry Socialism as “dangerous” are not above receiving bail-outs from the Government i.e. Wall Street, and AIG. To the contrary, that form of Socialism - Socialism for the rich - is quite alright in their minds, but paying off people’s mortgages with that same money, or using that money to re-build our infra-structure, and in doing so provide jobs - that would be a kind of Socialism they never could abide to this day. They are the biggest of hypocrites whose only objective is to “game” our system, which laws they have rigged to make it easier for them to do so, in order to amass, and protect by any means necessary, including whole armies, that which they have gained in too many cases by immoral, illegal, or borderline illegal, means. These selfish criminals, who would go to the lengths of pre-emptively starting a war to protect their positions, and profit by this war as well, without the slightest twinge of conscience as to it’s bloody consequences, have managed through the years to turn Socialism into a dirty word. These people persist in their mad uncaring lust to amass more than they could ever need in four lifetimes, and not only amass, but take away from others less fortunate than they by continuing to thwart the chances of people who are in need. And children go hungry; families go without homes, without work, without an education, without hope, just…without. But wait, the Right-Wing does care…they care if gays get married, they care if workers can bargain collectively, and they care that women should not have the right to determine what to do with their own bodies, even in cases of incestuous rape. Of course, these are truly large concerns when placed in juxtaposition to silly things like jobs, homes, education, basic necessities, etc.   This morning’s news has just informed me that one of the richest, fattest Republican pigs, Newt Gingrich - the very name makes my skin crawl – a candidate for President of this country, has been quoted saying of the Occupy Wall Street protesters, “they should get a job, and take a bath.” This person has the sensitivity to say this to a nation whose unemployment number stands at 13.9 million people. Another prominent Republican, Tim Pawlenty has said “suffering is not only necessary, it is essential.” I could never sit down to dinner with this sort of criminal.  There are many reading this who will disagree with me, and that, of course, is their right. I am only trying to explain to you all why I hate the Republican Party with all my heart and soul.   © tony powers and Barking in the Dark, 2011.

t5_2fwo,ropers,1321906151,"Let me tell you a story:  As you know, back in the olden days, computers were not personal. It took several individuals to operate a computer. I am not even talking about the users (of computing services). I am not even talking about the programmers. I am not even talking about the engineers and technicians who designed, constructed and installed the hardware. I am not even talking about the system administrators who maintained and serviced the computing system installation. I am talking purely about the [operators](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_operator), whose job it was to run, to operate the computer.  An old friend of mine used to be an operator. This was in a major IT company. He started being an operator before the [killer micros](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killer_micro) arrived on the scene. This meant he had specific duties, not just in the sense that he didn't get to do all of these other aforementioned people's jobs, but also in the sense that his duties were vendor- and system-specific. What the company needed him to have and use was basically a non-transferable skill set. And he kept working at this job for years, on this very important big iron system.   But meanwhile everybody and their grandmother got a Pee Cee at home, with em ess DOS. The kids who grew up on DOS became ""computerists"" – they became computing *generalists* who did everything. Sure, those 4.77MHz pseudo-16bit machines had nothing on what the big boys did on Real Hardware™, but boy oh boy, if those pesky little X-Wing-gadfly killer micros didn't start eating big iron's lunch and didn't knock down much of the mainframe business brick by brick like in so many Breakout games.   My friend didn't have a desk-top home computer. He worked on Real Hardware™, remember? He kept utilising and honing his very specialised custom big iron skills. The PC revolution passed him by. And in fairness – nobody ever asked him to buy a PC. Nobody ever exposed him to learn DOS. He did his job just fine, thank you very much.   Until that big iron machine was retired and his job disappeared.   And suddenly he was out there in the cold in a brave new world of personal computers that now defined his field. His skills in IT? No longer relevant. He had not only completely missed DOS, but also missed the hardware conventions that had formed around it. He didn't even understand the basic make-up and arrangement of components that had long since become typical for personal computers. How boot-up occurs, roughly how the BIOS works, and where the OS takes over, how DOS relates to Windows, what the typical pitfalls were – he didn't know any of that. And IT was his whole career, was all he knew anything about – just not anything that was relevant anymore.   It was very hard for him. He had to practically start over from scratch. He had missed the whole DOS era, and while it's easy enough to learn how to use the mouse, his ignorance of DOS did him no favours when making the switch directly from old iron to a world of Windows PCs.  He was a really nice and kind person too. I wish he'd had it easier, but he didn't.",™

The Bible tells me I can own slaves, but only from a neighbouring country. I am Canadian, so why can't I buy an American? The Bible supercedes human rights, according to those who don't believe in equality for GLBT people, atheists, people of other religions. Why not do away with that pesky non-slavery issue too?  Also, if you've eaten shellfish, shaved your facial hair, been in public on your period, or left your head uncovered, according to the very same book in the Bible you pull that homosexuality quote out of, you're going to hell with all the homos. Why is it okay for you to do those things?  Additional Details Thinking of you: don't worry, if I owned an American, I'd make sure it was safe from all those destructive behaviours. I'd keep it in an enclosure with plexiglass so that when they threw their faeces at me, they'd just be soiling their own space. I'd be nice and hose it down though, they're simple creatures and don't know what they're doing, after all :o)  Remember, kids: leash your American.

Just need to re-stack the order a bit.  - Curtain-puller that makes you go ""Meh."" ☑   - Toilet break a.k.a Diva's Match ☑   - Shameless plug for WWE '12. ☑   - ""Humor"" segment. ☑ (The Rock Chantalong/Singalong, not to mention the idea of Sin Cara being in a live match...)   - 5 vs. 5 decided by RKO out of nowhere. ☒   - Segment ending with John Laurinaitis texting. ☑   - Mark Henry and the Big Show tries for a 15 minute match for the World Heavyweight Championship despite having the stamina for a 3 minute match between them. Henry prevails. ☑   - Shameless plug for WWE '12. ☑   - CM Punk about to win the WWE Championship, gets screwed by Kevin Nash. ☒   - Team Bring the Hate wins clean over Awesome Truth, The Rock proceeds to knock out Cena. Fade to black with Cena sitting in the ring looking to be in pain. ☑  Impressed to see Sheamus getting DQ'd rather than to come across strong and eliminate Swagger and Hunico before getting eliminated and leaving Orton to take out Barret and Rhodes. Instead, Orton ended up putting them over good if they just bother to do something about it in the days to come. Rhodes adds another huge event to his rather handsome resume.  Even more glad to see CM Punk take the belt. Big, big win for him. Unfortunately that just means a rematch at TLC with the storyline hanging suspended from nothing at the moment.   The Rock was electrifying for the total of four minutes he was moving around inside the ring. (He probably was electrifying for the 43 minutes he kept jumping around on the apron as well). So now he'll go back to phoning it in, or sending it in via pony express or whatever he does in order to end up ""trending world wide"", while Cena goes back to being the most booed main event in recent WWE history. There was a tense moment in the end, during the showboating, where I almost expected Cena to do a full heel turn, but rather than to have Cena assault The Rock, they ended up with a perfectly expected turn of events. Cena rolling out and leaving The Rock to celebrate in front of the New York crowd is really something I should have expected.  Also, who the fuck books the Diva's match at 00:20 in a PPV?

That's not even the point. There absolutely is a case for fixing common issues in a somewhat more routine fashion. I don't dispute that. The problem is that *by design* many if not most so-called ""customer service"" departments are commonly run in a way that plays stats-games worthy of *The Wire* and leaves almost zero room for competent resolution and escalation of deserving issues. Some issues *do* need special attention. Customer support departments should have incentives to swiftly determine and facilitate that escalation where it is necessary. But the fact that The Big Run-Around™ is the norm is the least of the problems with the industry. Many practices that extremely commonly happen in the call centre industry do more than just border on [the illegal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unfair_business_practices). And the upper echelons commonly see nothing wrong with them, as long as the revenue keeps flowing and as long as the rabble is kept at bay. That is the problem. Wrong guidelines, wrong incentives, wrong deliverables, corrupt leadership. And that is endemic. And it doesn't deserve to be called ""customer support"".",™

That spirited debate arose because your post was wrong. So not only did it break the ""no pics"" rule, but it was a tad sensationalist. Instead of posting a picture, why not find a relevant article on the subject?  &gt;Reddit was once a great place with great potential.  ...then people started posting pictures of their cats and infographs with no sources. What sort of magical time are you talking about where reddit could go unmoderated with millions of users and still aggregate quality content?

Looking at r/all right now, 17 out of the 25 submissions are images, and most are jokes. Doesn't that bother you, that this site devolved from news and discussion to cheap laughs?  &gt;People should have the power to decide what they want to consume, and not a moderator or a reddit administrator unless that administrator gets his marching orders from a corporate executive which I believe to be the case here.

I'm thinking this would require some site integration to prevent people posting outrageous images and whatever with BBcodes - possibly just a text box in your main profile settings which lets you input your Bnet profile URL and then takes care of the rest internally. Of course this is easy for me to say when someone else would have to do it - which is why I'm making this post to see if it's actually a good idea or not before bothering any mods.      **MY OWN THOUGHTS/CONCERNS:**    1) Saves people constantly saying ""I'm such and such ranked whatever"" all the time in the constantly-changing ladder seasons.    2) Might cause flaming between players not respecting opinions of lower league kids? On the flip side however, might encourage people to be more respectful to higher ranked players and their opinions? Solution - not everyone has to use it - just revert and get rid of it if it incites too much e-penis waving.    3) I think it might create a useful insight to how players operate at different levels and might hopefully boost the level of respect between players of different leagues (maybe idealistic?).    4) Looks good, simple, clean and does not attract needless attention and clutter up forum posts like the other signature generators going around.    5) Could wildly break format for people looking at the site on mobile view? Maybe just disable for this (somehow)?      Poll: Is this a good idea?    **Yes, definitely.** (31)    62%    **No, forget it.** (16)    32%    **Maybe, but I have some concerns.** (3)    6%    50 total votesYour vote: **Is this a good idea?**([Vote](/userpoll/vote.php?poll_id=28425&amp;vote=0&amp;token=arxgUtZK)): Yes, definitely.  ([Vote](/userpoll/vote.php?poll_id=28425&amp;vote=1&amp;token=arxgUtZK)): No, forget it.  ([Vote](/userpoll/vote.php?poll_id=28425&amp;vote=2&amp;token=arxgUtZK)): Maybe, but I have some concerns.        Hopefully I'm not ""out of line"" in anyway by bringing this up.

t5_2qh2p,three_dee,1321993269,"&gt;It is impossible to know whether God exists.   Certainly a defensible position, but not unarguable either.  &gt;It is impossible to know whether God exists. Certain religious people ""feel"" that God exists, and come up with their own (bad and outdated) explanations as to how God is plausible. The arguments of atheism top most of those explanations, but atheism never disproved God, and it can never disprove God. It can disprove Christianity, which is what people here do the most anyway, but it can't ever disprove creation.  Atheism's job isn't to ""disprove God"".  We reject all claims till they're proven.  That's the scientific method and it works.  Your suggestion is to do it backwards (accept all claims until they are disproven) and that doesn't work.  That way, you wind up with Power Bracelets™ and homeopathy and other dumb shit that doesn't make any sense.  Because essentially, you are claiming we don't need evidence for any claims.  They're all equally valid.  If we believed that throughout history, we wouldn't have these computers we're talking to each other on right now.  &gt;To think that something as short-sighted, limited, tiny and insignificant as a human being could truly comprehend and explain something as high as the reason behind all existence is plain arrogance.  So you're against religion?  I agree.  &gt;The science most of you **worship**  You're using this word wrong.  Anyone who takes science seriously doesn't ""worship"" it.  They test it, assume it's wrong, try to poke holes in it, and make sure it works.  Very different from how worshipers approach God.  They look for a way to make God fit the facts, rather than questioning God to see if what they believe makes sense with the observable universe.  &gt;Making a decision on something you can't comprehend puts you in the same pit with all the believers you bash.  I don't make a decision on whether there's a God.  I think it's an open question, but there's no reason for me to believe there is one, so I don't.  That makes me an atheist.  If new evidence comes in tomorrow that there's a God, I'll be a theist.  But not without evidence.",™

In other words, both rejected by the community.  So much so that they didn't even appear in my search because I searched by ""top comments"".  Neither of these supports the idea advanced by the OP, that /r/atheism is famous for making complaints about sneeze responses; it actually confirms the opposite, that anyone making that claim is summarily downvoted because it's stupid.  But that doesn't stop people from making that argument against /r/atheism, because people don't give a shit about facts when they want to crap on something.  &gt;Note also that /r/atheism will loudly proclaim ""no true atheist"", while often holding the bulk of ""moderate"" theists responsible for the fringe nutjobs. I fail to see a difference.  More like, ""there is no such thing as a true atheist because we don't have a common ideology or dogma"".  Atheists can be smart, stupid, believe in homeopathy and Power Bracelets™, ghosts and UFO abductions.  It's all irrelevant, the only thing we have in common is we don't believe in God.  There can even be atheists who get offended by stupid things like God Bless You.  But they are an insignificant, tiny minority, as a quick search of /r/atheism shows.  If you read comments here, you would think the top 10 posts are all talking about sneezing.  People are prejudiced idiots who complain about things they don't even read.  And, ""fringe"" nutjobs aren't really ""fringe"" since there are 30,000+ different sects of Christianity, and ALL of them pick and choose which parts of the Bible to follow and which to ignore.  That's how the Bible works, it's a mess of contradictory gobbledygook.  You pick out parts that confirm your pre-existing beliefs, and pretend the Bible taught it to you.  Most Christians, to their credit (and I applaud them for it) focus on the very, very few nice parts of the Bible and reject the evil stuff.  That's good for the rest of us and it's a big improvement over how they behaved 150 years ago.  But that doesn't make them more ""real"" Christians than the ""fringe"" Christians who focus on the evil things and ignore the good.  Both ways are supported by the Bible if you cherry-pick.",™

t5_2qgzg,seancage,1322022310,"Comprehensive Suite Safeguards High-Speed Connections from Malicious Threats and Inappropriate Content   CUPERTINO, Calif. - August 21, 2003 - Symantec Corp. (Nasdaq: SYMC), the world leader in Internet security, today announced that Scientific-Atlanta will include Norton Internet Security 2003 with select cable modem shipments. Norton Internet Security 2003 is the most tightly integrated and complete online security and privacy suite. Scientific-Atlanta is the fourth largest cable modem supplier in the U.S. Under terms of the agreement, Scientific-Atlanta will ship Norton Internet Security 2003 with a 60-day trial subscription with WebSTAR™ DPX100™ and DPX200™ cable modems. Distribution will begin in North America. ""Scientific-Atlanta is one of the top five cable modem suppliers worldwide and we shipped over 270,000 WebSTAR products in the quarter that just ended,"" said Joe Wytanis, director of data product business within Scientific-Atlanta's Subscriber Networks Sector. ""The combination of Symantec's Norton Internet Security suite and our high-speed, standards-based cable modems delivers a powerful solution for proactive consumers who want protection against a wide range of potential threats."" ""Broadband connections provide the convenience and speed of always-on Web access, yet they can also present an appealing target for hackers and malicious code,"" said Steve Cullen, senior vice president of Symantec Consumer and Client Product Delivery. ""Symantec is pleased to offer to protect Scientific-Atlanta cable customers from these growing risks with Norton Internet Security-easy-to-use, proven security and privacy software that, like cable connections, is always on to guard all entry points against new and emerging threats."" According to a May 2003 Nielsen/NetRatings report, nearly 40 million people have broadband Internet access in their homes. Broadband users at home grew 49 percent year-over-year, while narrowband users declined 12 percent during May 2003. This rapid, widespread adoption of broadband introduces a growing population of computer users to the unique risks of having always-on connections to the Internet, which hackers can identify through port scans and use to gain unauthorized access to the user's PC. Norton Internet Security 2003 includes Symantec's best-of-breed antivirus, firewall, intrusion detection, privacy control and content filtering technologies in a single, easy-to-use suite. Norton Internet Security automatically blocks viruses, worms, Trojan horses and hackers and prevents confidential information from being sent without authorization in outgoing email messages and Microsoft Office or instant message attachments. Exclusive worm- and script-blocking technology automatically defends against known and unknown threats without the need for virus definitions. Norton Internet Security is the only security suite to offer a complete intrusion detection system, which adds another layer of security by automatically detecting and stopping malicious attacks such as BugBear, Nimda and Code Red. Further, virus definitions, firewall rules and intrusion detection signatures are updated automatically-without requiring user intervention-to ensure uninterrupted protection against the latest threats. Scientific-Atlanta customers will be offered a free 60-day trial subscription service from Symantec that will deliver regular updates to virus definitions, firewall rules, intrusion detection signatures and other security updates. Users are able to purchase a one-year subscription renewal after the expiration of the initial subscription period.

t5_2cneq,jhujhiti,1322038834,"I like explaining this sort of thing, so here goes, pretty much from square one:  DNS is the system that resolves names to IP addresses. Since your computer can't address a packet to ""www.google.com"", DNS is a **critical** mechanism for maintaining the system we're all familiar with.  The DNS is a globally-distributed database, delegated from the root ("".""). The servers that host the root have delegations (ie., pointers/hints) to servers that know more about the second-level domains. For example, the roots know who hosts "".com."" (all domains technically end with ""."", but it's almost always omitted). When I do a lookup for ""www.google.com"", the recursive server (the one actually following these pointers) will:  * Ask the root who owns .com. * Ask .com. who owns google.com. * Ask google.com. who owns www.google.com. * Return the answer from the server that owns www.google.com.  Essentially what divsky is saying is that the .org servers returned an unknown domain answer when queried. The domain effectively does not exist in the global DNS.  Now, why do some people still have answers while others get errors? This has to due with how answers are cached. Since designing a globally distributed database is Hard™, there are some tradeoffs. One of them is that a server will remember the answer to a question it's already asked and answered for a certain amount of time (dependent on the time-to-live set by the domain administrator). If my server hasn't done a lookup for a particular domain (technically, a particular ""resource record"" -- it's a lot more granular), it will need to follow the path from the root to get its answer. If it has, it will respond from what it already knows until the TTL expires. This makes old records hang around for a while after the domain actually disappears.",™

The dark miasma evaporates around the town when touched by the brilliant light emited by the Runes, but still spits waves of slimy undead which try to stop the ritual.  Even though hunderts of this soulless things fall consumed by the flames, the party need to fight desperately till the sunlight seals the binding. At dawn, as the night loses the fight against the day and the sun appears between the mountain peaks the last city guard falls under grasping claws of the undead. Alas in the Rune Light they still fight as translucent shemes even when their mangled bodies crash to the ground. The rays of sun wander agonizingly slow toward the key stone and few more minutes are needed - suddenly the light of the runes dimish and the time slows down to mere crawl .  The body of the priest laying at the feet if his ghostly presence. In broken voice he whispers ""I am so sorry, I can't give more."" It pains me to ask this from you, were you willing to sacriface a year and a day of your life  to stop this abomination?"".  If the heroes agree, the Runes explode with light like miniature suns.   After blinking the blindness away, the party realizes that they are suddenly standing in a big temple surrounded by hunderds of astonished people. A little more than a year is gone where they stood frozen in time. They are the heroes of the city and nearly everybody is excited when they come alive. Everyone of them lost not only a year of their life, but also is marked with a silver streak of hairs.  Later they discover they can teleport once per day (and once per night) to the rune stones (or fragments of the rune stone).   scnr  An artefact - like a Key that makes any door opened by it a passage to the room where its twin lies. Ring allowing the use of Mirror Pathways ( the space behind the mirror). Or let the get kind of bag of holding which is in reality a doorway to an ""abandoned"" fortress.  On the other hand all that are just places.  I can imagine that if you introduce an group of NPCs which the party befriends it could offer the same possibilities. Maybe a troupe of gypsies - after saving some of them from trouble the party runs every now and then into them.

Go to a cheese factory or dairy farm in your area an inquire where you might find some. Many cheese factories that don't sell curd directly can sell you a *very* young cheese that is still very curd-like and has the distinctive 'squeaky' texture on your teeth when you bit it while it's cold, this will suffice if you can't find curd, but don't go around thinking you're getting the Real Deal™, admit that you're having imposter poutine so you don't mislead your friends!  **EDIT** I live in a town where every restaurant has poutine, but we also have standalone 'Poutineries' which only serve poutine (various flavours as well). Compare the regular poutine on this site, to the 'Mama's Poutine' under the Chicken section. Yes, we serve chicken &amp; pea poutine, but it still must have the cheese curds to qualify as poutine.  Bottom line: chicken &amp; pea poutine exists, but this isn't it.  education -&gt; [Smoke's Poutinerie](http://smokespoutinerie.com/Menu.aspx)",™

Let me say once again that there are generally a third more greens in any fighting weyr since they are the fighter pilots, whose skills often saved the larger and less flexible dragons from getting Thread scored. Any Weyrleader welcomed with great relief the presence of each new green rider. But, since the greens are small and have exchanged speed and manoeuvrability for stamina, they generally fly only half of a Fall, being sent back to the Weyr to rest, returning only if a Fall lasts longer or is heavier than normal.   The blues are stronger, have a wider thrust of flame, and can last an entire Fall. The browns are stronger yet, with a wider and long thrust of flame, which is another reason they are often appointed as wingseconds. The bronze, of course, is the strongest of the fighters, having great depths of reserve and the most potent flame in length, depth and duration: the bombers you might say. They are invariably wingleaders, with two wingseconds, either or both of whom can be browns.   The queens don't like to be left out of the action and flame-throwers were their method of defence since they can't digest firestone. They fly low as the best way to catch whatever Thread might escape the upper level flights.   Back again to the different sexes involved. The greens, like their little cousins, are extremely affectionate, flirtatious, and when in season can be quite a problem to the Weyrleaders. However, some long-term unions were formed between greens and any of the other colors, bar the bronzes who always hope to make the queen theirs in her next mating flight. The greens oblige any of the males including bronzes...or we'd have a heap of sexually frustrated, very unhappy virgin male dragons.   As the queen is wholly heterosexual, larger and stronger than even the largest bronze, and certainly any browns, she mates infrequently and only when she feels an irresistible urge to procreate. (To be totally whimsical, she's catholic, you might say.) Nevertheless, she is not as amenable to being caught as the greens are. She makes quite a show of her sensuality, evades and taunts all the dragons rising with her in a mating flight. As she is larger and stronger, her stamina is considerable. The bronze that catches her has to be the smartest, strongest and fastest of the flight. The higher he can take her before linking with her, the longer he has to impregnate her which means a stronger and larger clutch. The stronger the impact of that mating is on the two riders also improves the clutch since the male is not inhibited by the queen rider's indifference. (It's no wonder Nemorth has so few dragons-she could barely get off the ground and neither S'loner, F'lon nor R'gul could stand the female.) If Weyrleader and Weyrwoman are totally compatible, clutches invariably reflect that accord and include more of the larger dragons, and possibly a queen.   There is a rational chain of command for very obvious reasons - ESPECIALLY DURING FALL. I designed my Pern Air Force quite carefully and, if it seems sexist to readers in this decade, I make no apologies for the world I designed thirty years ago: LONG before it ever occured to me that the World of Pern© would be online and subjected to alterations that contradict its basic traditions and canons.   This is my world, folks. I designed it. I haven't changed the design. When I gave permission for online games of Pern, I was assured by you, or your predecessors, that these traditions and social entities would be scrupulously followed. Most of you, and I thank you from the bottom of my heart, have kept that bargain.   Therefore you will not try to out-persona another member of your group and teach Maid Marian karate kicks and how to shorten her costumes despite the draughts that were prevalent in 12th century castles. Nor will you design newer bigger better models of the Ninja Turtles or Hercules with a Valley accent. War is not a word in the Pernese vocabulary. It's one reason so many people would like to live there. Including me.   Which brings me to my final point. Recently, I discovered that there may be quite a few players of the various sorts of Pern games who have never read a single Pern novel. They just enjoy playing games. Which is fine by me but causes some of the problems, which have been plaguing me, the Sysops, the Wizards or whoever runs the online games (It was for the fanzines.) Not that this is a ploy to sell more books because one can borrow one from a friend, who HAS read a Pern book, or the local library.   Reading a Pern book gives the player much more of the 'feel', the 'ambience' of the planet that so intrigues games players. And it also lays out the rules, and the whys of those rules, again and again. It also gives you insights into a persona that might be better than the travesties that have come to my attention.

The irony is, both anarch-capitalism and communism (not half arsed socialism) involve the total elimination of the state, they just use different means to achieve it.  Why has that never happened in the leftist system? Because those pesky human conditions like greed, jealousy and addiction to power.  Like yourself, the adherents will continually maintain that the theory is fine, it's just the implementation that fails.   &gt;Why is Africa never out of the agriculture age where as America and England did and surpassed them? Why is it that European and American economy are shrinking as their governments grow despite their relative stability and access to resource?  Because there's more involved than merely correlating amount of government with economic development. The authoritarian government of China has transformed the economy from agrarian peasantry prior to the overthrow of the Manchu Dynasty - to the economic powerhouse of today.   Taiwan experienced massive growth (becoming one of the Four Asian Tigers) under the single party control of the Kuomintang.  &gt;The laughable thing about you, and there are many things that are laughable about you, is that you don't know what you are advocating. You recognise complete state control would be very bad, but you don't make that connection on why it's bad and then apply that reasoning to every other service government provide. If public service are so essential to economy, why do you not want them to completely control it? Not even the whole economy, why don't you let them control the food trade if governments are so essential and food are an essential good? &gt; And when you say private and public partnership, you really mean the government telling the private market what to do. That's facism BTW.  No. What I'm advocating can be summed up by a sporting analogy. The private sector are the football teams on the ground. The ground, infrastructure and umpires are supplied by the government to ensure fairness and safety.  &gt;If resource were put into inventions that served no practical purpose - then that's a very fucking bad thing you nubskull. It means all those resources that was put into things that no one wanted was supposed to be put into the things that everyone wanted. That means people just wasted all their time and money. THIS IS BAD. People are already making inventions that serves a practical purpose in the market. Do you know who does that? People in the industry. Private people. Not the government. That's how entrepreneurship and competition work. And that's why central planning doesn't.  Which is why Marie Curie performed her work on radiation because she wanted to invent smoke detectors, and why Einstein patented E=MC^2 and why every split nucleus in power generation demands a royalty to OppenheimerCorp™.  Developments in quantum mechanics have lead to the laser, the transistor/microchip, the electron microscope, and magnetic resonance imaging. The study of semiconductors led to the invention of the diode and the transistor, which are indispensable for modern electronics.  You were saying about ""wasting time and money""?  I'm not even going to get into the irony that you're using a government funded invention to peddle your bullshit. Without the pioneering work of ARPANET and NSFNET (both government funded) you'd be stuck in a smoke filled cafe listening to jazz and bitching about government.  See, I have no problem with the fact that private enterprise takes these inventions/discoveries and eventually makes useful practical applications  for the rest of us to use. I say you're full of shit if you think a private enterprise is willing to fund comparable amounts of research for the sake of research.  &gt;He compares an economic rich state to an economic poor state and says ""Hayek was wrong because when you compare these two countries at this moment of time it rebuts hundreds of years of economic thought"".  Yes, that's so very different to saying: ""they've got too much government, they're fucked, let's get rid of government.""  How about you go through all those comparisons between Africa and the US/UK and draw some more irrefutable ""conclusions?""  Arrogant, simplistic and hypocritical.  ",™

But I don't eat pork and I don't like vinegar.  **Favorite 3 types of Candy:** chocolate covered nuts, peppermint candy and caramel.  **Chocolate Yes/No:** Kind of. Only if it has nuts, caramel and/or wafer/biscuit e.g. Twix, Almond Snickers, KitKat, almond Mars bars, chocolate with fruit and nut, etc.  **Favorite Scent**: Crisp/flowery scents. I find that I more likely than not will like any scent that has ""white"", ""crisp"", ""cotton"", ""mountain"", ""ocean"", ""linen"" or ""fresh"" in its name.  **Do you have any Hobbies?** I'm on the internet, mostly. Does that count? XD But I read, bake, cook, craft and write.  **Favorite Author/Genre of Book:** Fantasy and Teen Fiction. I really love Madeleine L'Engle, and highly respect JRR Tolkien. Currently reading Robin Hobb and George RR Martin, and both are quickly becoming favorites. I guess JK Rowling too.  **Favorite type of animal:** PANDAS! BUNNIES! KITTENS! PUPPIES! TARSIERS!  **Movie you would like to own:** Practical Magic. I don't know why, but it's one of my favorite movies of all time. Matilda is also a classic. When I was a kid, I could practically recite the entire movie dialogue off the top of my head.  **Favorite Color:** Pink. Blue (especially turquoise and electric). Lilac. Purple. Yellow. Green.  **What person (dead/alive) you would like to meet?** I honestly think it would be intriguing to interview Adolf Hitler. He's like the sane kind of crazy, so it would be pretty surreal to kind of view his thought process. Lady Gaga would be cool too. JRR Tolkien would be fascinating to interview.   **Favorite Music Artist/Type:** I love music in general, and I'm willing to give anything a listen. I'm just not really a fan of rap, techno, house and R&amp;B, though I'm willing to give those a try too if they come recommended highly enough.  **Do you Collect Anything?**Wind chimes.  **Favorite Stores to shop at:**I...don't really like to shop. However, I like H&amp;M and Tokidoki. But I'm really just a shirt, jeans/shorts and sneakers kind of girl. I also love cute/humorous/geeky shirts.  **Favorite Drink:** Water. I'm boring like that. I hate soda ;w;  **Favorite Sports Team/Athlete:** YUNA KIM. She's like a fairy on ice ♥  **Favorite Time of the Year:** The cold season...as cold as it gets in a tropical country anyway :/  **One Place You Would Like to Visit:** IRELAND! :D  **Favorite Magazines:** I don't really read magazines. I just read whatever's lying around the house.  **Favorite Restaurants to Eat at:**Japanese, Mexican and Italian.  **Favorite TV Show:**Lie To Me  **Breakfast, Lunch, or Dinner?** All of it. Just feed me good food. But breakfast for dinner is the best.  **One Actor or Actress You Would Want to Meet:**Angelina Jolie, because there's so many things being said about her, I just want to know what's really up with her. Lol.  **Favorite Movie Theatre:** The clean ones.  **Coffee or Hot Chocolate?** Either. It will depend on my mood.  **Favorite Type of Cookie:** Oatmeal-cranberry.  **Apple or PC?** Either. Though if we're talking gaming, it's definitely the PC.  **My favorite part of the day is:** Sunset. I look forward to every sunset because I never know what color combination it will be that day.  **If I ruled the world:** I would put people through a mandatory time-pressured maze with IQ- and EQ-testing obstacles. People who fail will be considered the ""lower class"" and will have strict procreation limitations imposed upon them. Those who prove to be unable to control their ""urges"" will be sterilized.  **Anything else your SS should know:** I'm a pretty easy-going person (except when it comes to ruling the world. That shit's srsbznz.) and I'm fairly easy to please. If at a loss, just think of what an overgrown five year old pixie might like. And there's your answer :D",♥

t5_2r2jt,mangarooboo,1322212782,"Reading this made me ache and want to cry. Story time :/  **TL;DR: My mom also has frequent bouts of gastrointestinal distress that can have her in and out of the bathroom all day/night; I used to be almost constantly annoyed with her about it and now I try to be more understanding. I just needed to vent about the guilt I feel about how I used to be annoyed. :(**  My mom got gastric bypass surgery a year and a half ago and is in more or less constant gastric distress as a result. She can't drink anything with dinner or she won't digest it, she can't eat too much because it'll make her nauseous, and if she eats too quickly, it'll all basically come back up (or want to). My dad and I are aware of this and try to remind her not to eat too much/too quickly/crappy food, but we can't control what she eats all the time.  Sometimes she does eat too much or she eats what she has too quickly or whatever, and she has to sort of sit back and relax and try not to get sick at the table. My dad and I can tell right away what's up so we gauge if it's actually serious or if it's just the regular old run-of-the-mill nausea. If it's regular stuff, we ignore it because: A) she doesn't want to talk about it, B) we don't want to talk about it, and C) we already know what's wrong, we've had many a discussion about it, and it's just the same thing every time.  At first, when it was all new to her, she'd inform us every time she was having distress. It got to the point where my dad and I knew what was going on before she mentioned it but she told us about it anyway. I don't know about him, but I got a little resentful of how she assumed we had no idea what was going on. That slowly branched out into other physical ailments of hers (she has terrible shoulders that aren't much good for lifting anything heavier than bubble wrap), and I'd get frustrated hearing her explain time and time again why she needs me to lift this giant box.   ""My arms just can't do it.""   '*I GOT it mom, I'll do it, just stop telling me it hurts!*'  I've realized recently, however, that she's only talking about all this because it frustrates her to no end that she can't eat stuff the way she used to and she can't lift stuff the way she used to. It's been a bit of a trial, but I've trained myself to not let my first reaction be annoyance or frustration, but compassion instead. Tonight, for instance, was Thanksgiving. Mom ate way too much way too quickly, and her stomachache came suddenly and without mercy. She looked up at me and gave me ""panic eyes,"" which basically ask me what she thinks I should do using eye contact. I nodded and mouthed, *""go""* to her, meaning ""Go to the bathroom right fucking now and to hell with the company, I'll check up on you in a few minutes."" She got up and bailed. She ended up being pretty okay, but I wandered to the back bathroom to check on her a few minutes later. She mentioned that she appreciated that I can always tell what the matter is and how to handle the situation.  Ugh, I guess... the reason why I sat here writing this for a while is I'm really, really sorry you have family members that shun you for something that isn't your fault. I never got to the point where I'd say anything to my mom's face, but she probably knew from looking at my facial expressions that I was irritated about something. I feel awful about ever feeling that way. I wish I could give your whole family a talking to or something. :/ Reading your story made me feel really sad.

t5_2qhx4,CaptainSarcasmo,1322219726,"Granted.   The second link did mention that there is a difference between setting up for a suited squat and a raw squat  &gt;For Standard Rack Squatters: &gt; &gt;Set your feet under the bar, at about shoulder-width apart. I’ve seen countless squatters in reader submitted videos who take the bar out in a split stance. This may work on lighter weights, but it will hold you back at maximum attempts because it can throw you off-balance. &gt; &gt;Arch your back and push your hips back. Take a deep breath into your belly and break the bar out of the racks by pushing your hips forward. Still holding your breath, step back and out. You should only need 2-3 steps to take your squat stance.

t5_2rxrw,cblname,1322220665,"Confused if you are a niceguy™ ?  Quick test:   ---  * Do you only spend time with a girl if you think it could lead to something more(going as far as to falsify what may seem a genuine friendship with one only hoping it will lead to intimacy)?  * Is it the girl's job to make all big decisions in the relationship?  * Do you have any spiteful/bitterness towards your previous failed conquests?    ---  [Niceguy™](http://www.heartless-bitches.com/rants/niceguys/ng.shtml) tend to engage  a neutral platonic relationship with a girl they like, never clarifying their underlying agenda hoping this is enough to lead to something more(believe that it's the girl's job to reciprocate with sex/intimacy/all decision making). But quite often this just leads the girl to think it is a genuine friendship. When niceguy™  secured a friendship and doesn't get any further, they get impatient and mad at the girl if she starts dating someone and quickly end the friendship calling the girl ""evil, manipulating bitch for leading them on"". After which niceguy™  almost seem genuinely surprised why they are seen as manipulative ... after all, it was them who carried on with a facade of a false friendship they were only engaging as an exchange of sex/intimacy out of the girl.   Or worse: because niceguys are too much of a welcome mat, they get targetted by predatory women, used and abused and as a result become bitter and feel *all* women are like this.",™

t5_2qh1i,HatHatHatHat,1322250504,"Female here. First time post, and my heart is beating like a drum because I really identified with this thread but am wildly nervous about posting.  I was a butt ugly kid. Early-bloomer tomboy who thought the world was a rip-off for females because it seemed like as a girl, you had to sell your soul to be something that boys liked, and that being yourself just wouldn't cut it. On top of it, I was a smarty pants (borderline obnoxiously so) and was moved up a grade in primary school. One day at about the age of 16 my mom sat me down and gave me her version of a ""makeover"" and within weeks I had a steady boyfriend. (think Princess Diaries Anne Hathaway before/after) I played a lot of sports, and grew quite tall- having a 34'' inseam, so use your imagination there. When I was a senior, I remember walking down the hall in a tight cardigan and plaid mini skirt and upon seeing me and checking me out up and down one of the most popular guys at school loudly yelled, ""You get my vote for MOST CHANGED!"" because I think I was fairly invisible until I dressed my curves and made up my face.   I have been told I look like Cindy Crawford, Jessica Simpson, Kate Winslet, and a whole bunch of other really random celebs that don't look much like each other. I have strong facial features that got me some cash modeling, but they're a unique kind of beauty.    **PROS**   *it is a lot easier to get what you want in a tense situation, especially if you are reasonable, nice, and understanding. Playing a little dumb really helps, because people assume you're only what you look like on the outside. This has saved my ass so many times, and the asses of my friends who recruit me to go untangle a situation with a soothing voice and a pretty face. It got me out of a huge fine overseas, and many late fees, getting friends out of the back of cop cars, etc. However it does take confidence and empathy as well- but the face definitely opens the door and I know this.  *I know for the time being (until my youth runs out) I will always be able to find someone to date.   *I made money with my looks- promo, print, and runway modeling, and it was good money.   *Free stuff- deals, coupons, even calls my way during sports. Not every day, mind you, but every so often.   *A's in certain classes from creepy teachers and profs.   *drinks at bars, ashamedly.   *getting attention first, before anyone else, even if I am not seeking it or there's a huge line/crowd etc.    **neutrals**  *I feel as if for some reason, the way I look specifically makes people assume things about me and by this I mean the actual shape of my face and body. I am not ""cute"" nor ""pretty"" like Emma Watson, Hillary Duff, or Jessica Alba. I am more Veronica Lake/Cindy Crawford. My ex recently got a new girlfriend and my mom showed a co-worker the picture of his new girlfriend. The co-worker said, ""Well that girl is really pretty, but your daughter is stunning."" So whatever that means.  I think my face looking the way it does combined with my height and shape makes me radiate some kind of accidental sexuality. Doesn't matter if I am in sweats or tight jeans. I don't know if I like this or hate this, because clearly I could use it to my advantage however when you feel people's eyes constantly lasering a layer off your skin off it begins to mess with your head. I also think that I scare a lot of people away, I have heard many a time how intimidating it was to come and approach me. I have started dressing really effeminately so that people think I am cuter, sweeter, like I want to feel more innocent or something... I feel as if the second I put on a pantsuit or a pencil skirt, everyone sees me as this crazy man-eater who will steal your husband and your job, breaking hearts as I please along the way. I don't know how I feel about it all. For example last night a married friend of mine and I were going to check on someone outside of a bar, and his wife quietly freaked out and insisted on coming with. Crap like that, seriously... I don't know what to do about it.    **CONS**  *People hate you. People want everything to see you fall into disastrous ruin. If I had a nickel for every time I have heard, ""Man, I HATED you until I got to know you!"" I would have like, $1.00. The rumors that are started, especially when you look like a sex-bunny, are terrible. YES, I want to be pretty, YES, I wear makeup, and so technically speaking it is my own fault! BUT it doesn't mean I am going to steal your boyfriend or take all the attention away from you at whatever social function we're going to! I am not a threat! Seriously!  *I have no close female friends. Zilch.    *Any intelligence or authority you have is automatically challenged because people don't want you to be attractive and smart, or in a position of power. I have learned people only like you to be one or the other. This was hard adjusting to in grad school. My peers really critically assess anything I produce (which I guess just makes it better in the long run) however the criticism isn't equally distributed.   *Men want to possess me. Like keep me fenced up or in a tower, and nothing makes me feel worse about myself. I also hate the testosterone fueled 'tude given off by the seemingly most humble and non-overprotective guys that I somehow inspire.   *I am terrified of growing old, because I know I am going to be perceived as a total cougar.     *something you should know*  I consider myself to be pretty smart, no- really smart. I am unafraid and confident, and I believe the combination of my brain and my face are to blame for this. I guess this makes me intimidating, however I was a total ugly duckling. This means I know what insecurity, jealousy, and envy feel like. This also means I know what revenge means for someone with scorned feelings.  The best advice I was given was by my cousin who told me that popular people aren't always the best looking, but rather popular people are nice to everyone regardless. Being nice to everyone and treating everyone like people generally means that it is reciprocated, and therefore you will become popular.   IF I am genuinely nice to you because I want to get to know you, and you just reciprocate with hate because of the way I look... I will remember it. And if I am feeling really immature, or hurt, or somehow my pride has been trampled on because I have tried so hard to earn your respect and you haven't given me the slightest chance? I promise you that the next time I know you and I are going to be at the same social function that I will wear my very most flattering pencil skirt and deep cut blouse, those ridiculously sexy heels that make me about 9'' taller than you, my very most favorite bombshell lipstick, and I think since I wear my hair up just about every day, I'll set it in long, flowing waves.   And so, I become what you want me to be. I hate myself for it for perpetuating something I should know better than doing, you hate me for it because you feel like an ugly little grub, and god kills a kitten.   ♥  ",♥

Yesterday though I had some major issues with both Battlelog and Origin when I tried to let a friend test my copy of BF3 on his computer (mostly to see if it would run on his gaming laptop.)  Our first problem was that Origin for some reason installed Battlefield 3 in a directory with the ™ (TM symbol) at the end which apparently crashes the game, so he had to rename the folder and changed the path in the registry to let Origin know that this was the install folder.  After restarting his computer we thought that now it was time to play, oh but no.. He could not use Chrome to join games and because he did not have firefox installed we tried IE (yes we did... sue us) but due to being the 64-bit version it did not work either so he had to install firefox, I know that I've used chrome on my computer so it has to be a rare problem.  TL;DR There are some quirks but the game really makes up for it. What I usually say when someone asks me if BF3 is any good I say: ""Yes it's awesome, it's just some things around the game that does not always works that could make you go mad.""",™

t5_2qh1i,bassett_horn,1322346980,"guy here, and IMHO this is the main difference between males and females regarding friends:   - To men, a friend is someone we *do something with* (sports, hiking, watch movies, play music, play video games, etc).   - To women, a friend is a non-sexual soulmate.   Guys tend to understand that our friendship is *limited*. Even when we're very good friends with another guy (ie, we talk about Big Issues and ask for Serious Advice), we usually know that our two lives only overlap a little bit. We know that the other guy has a job, a family, a girlfriend/wife, other hobbies, etc. Male friendships are often ""emotionally shallower"" than female friendships (and I mean that in a good sense, as explained below).   In contrast, lots of modern American women seem to expect that their friends be ""non-sexual soulmates."" The trouble is, ""soulmates"" are an illusion. No one is perfect. You'll have fights and disgreements with everyone. No one will approve of everything about you or the way you live. The intense emotional bonding of female friendships is a double-edged blade: it can provide a powerful sense of community and understanding. But, as you've learned, the downside is that you're desperate for the approval of your friends. That's simply unhealthy.   So how to change? Be a bit more like a guy. Seriously. Next time you make new female friends, resist the urge to make the discussion all about your Feelings® and her Feelings® and the *meaning* of your Feelings®, etc. If you don't have an ""active"" hobby, get one: exercise, playing cards, playing guitar, whatever. And cultivate friendships that are built *only* around that activity. ",®

t5_2cneq,rambojenkins,1322377427,"There are certainly issues with the current system in place, however, the solution will not be creating alternative/competing currencies.   Part of the issue is that we don't allow creative destruction in our companies. The Fed™ would work a lot better if companies were simply allowed to fail.  Creative destruction says that when a company fails, other (sometimes new) companies learn from the mistakes of that company and much like natural selection, pass on the lessons learned to companies that are made in the future.   Right now, companies are allowed to do everything involved in failing, but not actually fail. They are allowed to stay alive and ""reproduce"", spreading their awful ideas to other companies. If they were simply allowed to go bankrupt the economy in the long run would be much stronger.   In the short-run, failures of huge banks would be tough, but simply allowing huge failures to continue on only sets up inevitable collapses in markets that are even larger than if we had simply let the company fail in the first place.  Some of the bad rap that the fed gets comes from pressure from political parties to bail out failing companies.

The primary ill here is economic marginalization where these people are only seen as worth help if they can make some sort of narrowly-defined contribution to a small set of employers. In these conditions, the talents you describe are, in effect, worthless and not reinforced by economic or social contingencies. What is needed are human development grants with no demand for strictly economic return, but rather aid for the sake of easing the misfortunes of these people. Unfortunately, neoliberal economic moralizing has concluded that these people are worth only what they can contribute to the wealth-based economy despite no opportunities to do so. It's a vicious cycle and more and more people are finding themselves trapped in it.   edit/disclaimer: I am not a sociologist and this advice is not to be taken as a substitute for true sociological insight.

t5_2r4cj,Triox,1322383782,"Also, I thought I would make a post on some other tips on how to make sure YOU have a good connect:  1.) If you are using a router, make sure your ports are opened.  Check [portforward.com](http://portforward.com/) for how to do it on your specific router.  After that, open up the following ports:  **On Xbox**  * Port 88 (UDP) * Port 3074 (UDP and TCP) * Port 53 (UDP and TCP) * Port 80 (TCP)  If you are on GFWL also open:  * Port 443 (TCP)  **On PSN**  * Port 80 (TCP) * Port 443 (TCP) * Port 5223 (TCP) * Port 3478 (UDP) * Port 3479 (UDP)  ""For voice / video chat and online game play, direct communication with other PS3™ systems is used for data transmission during voice / video chat and online gaming. The port number used for this is **UDP: 3658**. However, you may need to use a different port number when  you are connected using a NAT router.""  2.) Make sure nothing else is pulling a bunch of bandwidth while you are playing.  I know this seems simply, but it seems to be the biggest contributor to bad connections online.  When you are going to play make sure you (or someone else) isn't doing the following: torrenting (this will RAPE your connection), downloading stuff (from a website, steam, origins), streaming (netflix, twitch.tv). This may be hard if you are living with other people though.  3.) Don't play on wireless.  Wireless drops packets.  Unless you are leeching bandwidth from your neighbor (ಠ_ಠ), you're wireless router can accept a wired connection.  Either set up your system/TV closer to your router/modem, or spend the money to get a long cat5 cord.   This is just the basic stuff.  If you plan on playing online seriously, this should be a bare mimimum of what you should do, in my opinion.",™

That was after all your original point.  Here are the facts: there is nothing in Islam that advocates honor killings, ignorance, extreme violence, hindering others from practicing their religion, or sexism period. Men and women have different rights because of the difference in their roles but that does not make them unequal. Why does no one ever point out that Islam was the first religion that gave widespread and legal rights to women for divorce and their own earnings? Under shariah it is NOT allowed to stone a woman for being raped or premarital sex. Yes women are given less inheritance rights but that is balanced by the fact that whatever money a woman earns in a marriage is hers exclusively while whatever a man earns is equally divisible in the case of divorce. Violence is allowed in defense and it is not okay to kill innocents. Islam is also among the first religions to recognize animal rights. Factory farms where animals are cooped up for their entire lives are haram (not allowed). Animals must be allowed to roam and live a pain free life. Islam advocates the gain of knowledge and it is commanded by the prophet himself. These are all tenets of Islam (keep in mind we are not debating what muslims do).

Yes, I was allowed to socialize with non-JWs, but the Watchtower Society (which is kinda like what the Vatican is to the catholic church) strongly discouraged that. The JW faith is a very divisive one. It's us vs. them. If you are a JW, you are ""in the truth"". If you are not JW, you are ""in the world"" and thus part of the devil's world. So socializing was allowed, but don't get too attached.  &gt; Did you feel like you were correct in what you were doing?  Absolutely, 100%, totally correct. The grass is green, the sun rises in the morning and God exists. It was all part of ""reality"" as I was taught. It felt good to ""know"" that I was on the winning side of some kind of spiritual war, one with all of mankind at stake. I felt privileged to have this deep understanding of who God was and what his plans were. I had it figured out! If only other people would see what I saw; their lives depended on it, I had to help save them!  &gt; How did holidays feel? How did it feel being pulled from school on Halloween?  I'm Dutch, so I never went through Halloween, but there was still stuff like Christmas. I was always a very easy child, so I never complained. I never really cared about those parties. I still don't. I do, however, remember that my sister picked me up from school when I was five or six, and someone in my class had their birthday. They had popcorn to celebrate. I had some, because hey, popcorn, right? So my sister picked me up from school, put me on the back of her bike and softly, with all the love in the world, told me that was not what Jehovah wanted. I felt a bit guilty, but I just nodded and kept eating. Because hey, popcorn!  &gt; What are your beliefs now? How does it feel looking back?  I am now an atheist. There has been, so far, not enough evidence for me to believe in the existence in a god, but I could be wrong. (Some would call this agnosticism; William Lane Craig calls this ""ahhh-theism"", and I say weak atheism.) But I am also sure as one can be that Yahweh/Jehovah does not exist (strong atheism). I've done some reading on how Yahweh started out, developed, etc. and that kind of put that god on the same level of likelihood as... say... The Little Mermaid. I feel pretty silly, thinking back. But oh well, I was ignorant and gullible... All I can do now is fix that as much as possible.  &gt; Any stories?  Well, there's one thing that the Society needs above all: information control. Having access to good information is exactly what [turned me atheist](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/g7tnt/another_jehovahs_witness_bit_the_dust_or_how_i/). They tell you it's okay to scrutinize your beliefs, but if you disagree you're wrong. Most likely members would not even come to the point of ever disagreeing, because JWs have their own ecosystem of information. Everything is regulated. Do you want to know something about the bible? Anything at all? The JWs have The Truth®. You don't need to look anywhere else. Especially not on the site of apostates because they are unwittingly in the pay of Satan and are out to pull you away from your loving heavenly father, etc.  Having thrown all my beliefs overboard and going back to basic, I was of course free to pursue more knowledge from *secular* sources. It was absolutely refreshing, like you just came from your lazy chair, opened the front door and stepped out into the sun.

t5_2r82v,quatch,1322497384," So what happens to to ODD children? There are four possible paths.  * Some will grow out of it. Half of the preschoolers that are labeled ODD are normal by the age of 8. However, in older children, 75% will still be noticeably defiant later in life. * The ODD may turn into something else. 5-10 % of preschoolers with ODD have their diagnosis changed to ADHD. In some children, the defiant behavior gets worse and these children eventually are diagnosed with Conduct Disorder. This progression usually happens fairly early. If a child has ODD for 3-4 years and he hasn't developed Conduct Disorder, then he wonג€™t ever develop it. * The child may continue to have ODD without any thing else. This is unusual. By the time preschoolers with ODD are 8 years old, only 5% have just this condition and nothing else. * The child develops other disorders. This is very common.  Medical Treatment of Oppositional Defiant Disorder  Recent studies demonstrate that certain medications can help with Oppositional Defiant Disorder. The research is preliminary, but the studies show that under certain circumstances medical treatments may help.  In one study, Ritalin was used to treat children with both ADHD and ODD. Researchers found that when treated with Ritalin, 90% of the children no longer had the ODD. However, this was a poorly executed study. The researchers dropped a number of children from the study because they were too defiant to take their medication as scheduled. Still, even if these children are included as treatment failures, the study still showed a 75% success rate with Ritalin.  In two separate studies, researchers examined the use of Strattera on children with both ADHD and ODD. One study showed that Strattera helped, one study showed it did not help.  In Canada, researchers found that Risperdal helps aggressive children of below normal intelligence. ADHD was not a factor. It didn't matter if the children had ADHD or not.  In another study, 80% of children with explosive behavior improved when given the mood stabilizer, Divalproex.  ODD Alternative Medical Treatment  No extensive studies have been run testing alternative medicine in ODD children or defiant teens. However, an alternative medicine that helps with ADHD should be effective with ODD. There was a pilot study examining the use of Omega-3 oils and vitamin E in ODD children. Both helped the problem behavior to some degree.  Psychological Intervention for Defiant Child Behavior  The main treatment for Oppositional Defiant Disorder is parental management. That means parents of ODD children or defiant teens need to improve their parenting skills in order to meet their child's particular needs and maintain their own sanity.  Originally, these programs were given by health care professionals either privately or in group settings and were expensive and not available everywhere. However, research has come out that demonstrates that a well structure home study parenting program is just as effective, less expensive, and far more convenient. ",™

It can be a problem when carrying the camera over your shoulder with the lens hanging downwards, as having the zoom continually extend to its maximum length is not just irritating, but also makes the lens more vulnerable to being knocked and damaged.      However zoom creep can also be a problem when pointing the camera either upwards or downwards when shooting, as it means that the lens can attempt to zoom under its own weight; this isn’t much of a problem when shooting hand-held (simply keep hold of the zoom ring), but can become a genuine problem when shooting at slow shutter speeds with the camera on a tripod, at which point holding the zoom ring is not an option….

t5_2qh61,jaxspider,1322526307,"##Sticky goo on Pa. turnpike disables about 150 cars  (AP) – 5 days ago    PITTSBURGH (AP) — A flood of gooey black muck dropped from a tanker truck disabled about 150 cars and damaged an unknown number of other vehicles along a nearly 40-mile stretch of the Pennsylvania Turnpike, officials said.  A leaking valve on a tanker spread driveway sealant over the eastbound lanes of a long stretch of the Turnpike between New Castle and the Oakmont Service Plaza on Tuesday night, Turnpike spokesman Bill Capone said. Turnpike operations officials on Wednesday said 150 or more cars were disabled when the sticky goo covered their tires and wheels. Some state police and turnpike maintenance vehicles had to be towed away after getting stuck in the tar-like substance, according to the turnpike operations center. Traffic was moving normally by Wednesday morning, but the sticky mess had already hindered the travel plans of some motorists traveling for the Thanksgiving holiday.  Laura Frick told WTAE-TV she was traveling from Cleveland to New Jersey for the holiday. ""Now we have to turn around and go back home,"" Frick said. ""It's horrible.""  Retired firefighter Bob King told the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review the experience was the most harrowing of his life. ""It caught us off guard,"" said King, who now lives near Chicago. ""It didn't seem like anyone knew what it was or what to do. It had to be an incredible amount of tar. It's still piled on my tires.""  Cpl. Mike Corna, with the state police barracks which patrols the pike near Pittsburgh, said Wednesday the driver will be cited for not properly securing his load, though the specific tickets to be issued were still being determined. Police have yet to trace the origin of the load. The tank was filled somewhere in Ohio.  Maintenance crews got out quickly, dumping sand on the pooled goop and using snow plows to push it on to the shoulder, turnpike spokesman Carl DeFebo said. The mess was mostly confined to the right lane and the roadway didn't have to be shut down while workers tried to clean it up because the substance hardens in about 15 minutes, DeFebo said.  ""It's been cleaned up since about 11 o'clock last night,"" DeFebo said Wednesday. Turnpike officials urged motorists whose cars were damaged to stop calling its operations center and instead call Traveler's Insurance at 800-238-6225 and follow the prompts to file ""business claims.""  The insurance company is handling claims on behalf of Marino Transport Services of Stevensville, Md., which operates the truck.  Copyright © 2011 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.",©

t5_2qqlo,therealprotonk,1322544621,"&gt;Democracy doesn't mean you must have direct control over the current government.  Yes and no.  This is getting a little meta, but you've touched on one of my pet peeves so I'll say something.  The way reddit works™ is mods get near-absolute control over the content, look and members in their subreddit.  Users who don't like it can piss off to another subreddit or make their own in which they can play dictator.  There are big advantages to this system, primarily that it stops a group of people outside a given community from backseat driving another one.  But you know how reddit works, so let me get to the point.  How it works *technically* is distinct from how it *could* work given the consent of the mods and maybe even how it *should* work.    To use your example (which is a good one), the mods could close this place up if they wanted.  It would be within their technical abilities to do so.  But it would be a **huge** fucking waste of time and resources (that's not including the circlejerking and moaning over the closure, c.f. the AMA fiasco).  Just as it would be a huge waste of time to delete every third submission just because, even though the mods *could* do it.  Wouldn't it be much nicer if the mods said ""hey I know we technically can ignore everything you jerks say but we're going to listen because that will make everything run smoothly""?   &gt;&gt;we want mods to make judgment calls all the time that leave a non-trivial percentage of the userbase unhappy one way or the other  &gt;That's exactly what I'm saying.  My point there was to say that *if* we are going to have stated rules, a rule whose interpretation consistently divides the userbase (and even the mods) is a crappy rule.  We should get rid of it or replace it with a rule which has a more consistent interpretation.    To wit, if the LJ rule isn't actually a bright line then mods end up removing or keeping LJ-ish rage comics on a more controversial basis: whether they suck or not.  Just as you say, mods *can* do this, but historically on this subreddit they haven't.  So if we have a rule which forces the mods to make those kinds of decisions, maybe it is a crappy rule.  ",™

t5_2qhwp,Farkamon,1322545773,"This is why I don't expect TOR's endgame to be all that thrilling.  The storyline is great; it's gripping, it's immersive, and it's very good in conveying that feeling of getting more powerful.    But if you teach the player to expect that the whole way through, then dump them at the end with a series of repeated raids and pvp, all that teaching goes out the window and you're back in Grindland.  You can't train a player to expect great stories, then drop it off the wagon once they reach max level and tell them to raid dungeons forever.  It's an unsustainable model.  It's stupendous for the first 50 levels, but once you hit that end wall, there's nothing left to keep you coming back because you've eaten through all the content, especially since WoW has trained all MMO enthusiasts that there's no reason to care about the game until you reach Max Level, which is where the Real Game™ is.  They literally cannot generate content faster than players can chew through it.  The strength and longevity of WoW revolves around teams and raiding, but more importantly it teaches the player they are just a cog in a machine.  TOR goes complete opposite of this and makes you feel special and important in the world.  And once a player hits the level cap and says ""Hey wait, I'm just another Jedi, I'm not special at all,"" they'll go do something else.",™

Making RF isn't as simple as putting AC into a wire, if the antenna is not a minimum wave length long in relation to the frequency (usually 1/8 - 1/4 wavelength) the power you are transmitting will reflect back into the transmitter (which at high power levels will blow your RF amplifier).  You are better off using actual cellular devices as not only will they give you the right frequency ranges and a tuned antenna, they will give you more accurate peak and average power.  To verify your frequency you are going to either need a dedicated frequency counter that RF folk use, a high end oscilloscope, or a spectrum analyser. But really the important thing here is going to be power level, which will require a RF power meter between the antenna and the antenna, AND a stand alone RF field meter.

t5_2qh9z,Rivensteel,1322628986,"Short answer: Hereditary angioedema  Long answer:  Medical Mysteries: Abdominal pain has been diagnosed, but it’s not curable  By Sandra G. Boodman, Published: November 28  For years before the identity of her long-standing problem was revealed, Hannah Love’s family had its own name for the periodic, disabling episodes: “Hannah’s stomach thing.”  The attacks, which first struck when she was 3, would gradually progress from discomfort to a crescendo of sharp pains to an abdomen so swollen she could not bear the touch of clothing. Nausea and vomiting invariably followed.  “Usually I would lie down in front of the TV with a bowl until it passed,” recalled Love, now 38. Between episodes, which lasted 24 to 48 hours and occurred on average every few weeks, she was fine.  Doctors initially shrugged off the problem, figuring it would pass. They prescribed drugs that didn’t help and ran tests that found nothing. After conventional medicine provided no answer, her family turned to a host of alternative therapies that proved equally useless.  “It was humiliating to not have a name for something that was so clearly present in my life,” recalled Love, an associate editor at the University of California Press in Berkeley who grew up in nearby Oakland. “I was thinking, ‘How could they believe me?’ ’’ Doctors had told her parents that they thought the problem was psychological; one doctor suspected she was bulimic, which Love vehemently denied.  So when, at age 17, she learned the name and cause of the problem that had dominated her life, Love was surprised to feel oddly disappointed.  “I was sort of like — what? All those years and it was just a blood test?” she recalled telling her mother. The doctor who ordered the test remembers his distinctly different reaction. “I probably had ordered this test 10 times, but hers is the only one that came back positive,” said Ronald Adler, a retired gastroenterologist who remembers the details of Love’s case more than 20 years later. “I was relieved and happy that at least we had an answer. I remember being more worried about how to treat it.”  Trying alternative remedies  Until she was 6, Love said, her pediatricians didn’t do much except offer advice about possible symptomatic relief in the hope that the problem, whatever it was, would go away as she got older. Antibiotics didn’t help, and Love was growing normally so it didn’t seem likely that she had a malabsorption problem. A specialist suggested an endoscopy, a procedure that involves threading a tube down the throat and into the stomach to inspect the upper GI tract, which Love’s mother vetoed because she considered it overly invasive.  Frustrated by the lack of progress, Love’s mother turned to alternative medicine.  For the next several years, until she was about 11, Love received various unconventional treatments. She saw a homeopathic physician who treated her with herbs and other substances. She underwent biofeedback, psychic healing, nutritional treatments and Reichian therapy, which involves massage and breathing exercises.  All failed, although the homeopath noticed that Love exhibited “rebound” abdominal tenderness: pain when pressure is released, not applied. Most commonly a sign of appendicitis, which had been ruled out much earlier, it can also indicate swelling.  Because most of the practitioners saw her only when she was well, “they tended to interpret my symptoms in a diffuse way,” she said. But Love and her family, exquisitely attuned to her “stomach thing,” had discerned patterns: attacks seemed linked to stress, excitement and fast food.  “We were the experts,” she recalled. “We knew how to get through the attacks, how to inform my school and teachers. We knew that travel, sleepovers, parties, all came with the risks that I could become sick.”  Her robust health between episodes added to the diagnostic confusion. It also “made denial a little easier than with some chronic conditions, because no matter how many times I would get sick, in the back of our minds there was this constant hope that maybe it wouldn’t happen again,” Love said. As she got older and became more embarrassed by her illness, she tried to hide it, which was difficult given her frequent absences from school.  Around age 13, her mother began taking her to a new round of specialists. One recommended exploratory surgery for a possible intestinal obstruction, although a CT scan later found none. A pediatric gastroenterologist suspected Meckel’s diverticulum, a small vestigial bulge in the intestine that can cause pain and swelling, which was also ruled out. A third suggested that her problem was an abdominal migraine, whose stomach symptoms mimic those felt in the head. Love’s mother rejected the doctor’s recommendation that her daughter take potent drugs to combat it.  When she was 15, Love developed a new symptom: the abdominal attacks were accompanied by swelling in her hands, feet and, more ominously, her throat.  A rheumatologist was stumped and sent her to an allergist; food allergy testing detected only a mild sensitivity to wheat. The allergist referred her to Adler, a new gastroenterologist, for a colonoscopy. The day she saw him in May 1990, Love was recovering from an attack and sported a circular red rash on her chest.  A tip-off and a test  “I think in gastroenterology, unexplained abdominal pain is attributed to irritable bowel syndrome,” Adler said, recalling that he immediately ruled out this catchall diagnosis. “People with IBS are never quite satisfied with their digestive function,” he said. By contrast, Love felt fine between attacks.  “That was the tip-off,” Adler said. So was the rash.  Adler told Love and her mother that he wanted to hold off on the colonoscopy and order specialized blood tests. From his earliest days in practice, Adler said, he always carried “a short list of exotic things” tucked in the back of his mind in case more common causes didn’t explain a patient’s problem.  The blood test showed what Adler suspected. After 14 years, “Hannah’s stomach thing” finally had a scientific name: hereditary angioedema, or HAE, a serious disorder marked by swelling and caused by a deficiency in a blood protein called a C1 inhibitor.  The disorder, which often surfaces in childhood, was once called angioneurotic edema, because doctors erroneously thought it had a psychological cause. First described in 1882, angioedema most often affects the gastrointestinal tract; in some patients it can cause swelling so dramatic that it resembles the late stages of pregnancy. Death can result if throat swelling occurs and emergency treatment isn’t administered in time. And in about 30 percent of patients, a non-itchy rash accompanies a swelling attack, which can be triggered by stress.  There is no cure for the condition, which affects about one in 50,000 Americans, according to the Genetics Home Reference. Although most cases are familial, about 20 percent, Love’s among them, occur as the result of a spontaneous genetic mutation. The child of a person with HAE has a 50 percent chance of developing it.  When her mother called with the news, minutes after she had spoken to Adler and learned the diagnosis, Love said she was stunned. “More than anything, I remember not believing her,” she said. “At that point, I thought there was no way we were ever going to figure it out.”  The news was bittersweet, because there is no cure for HAE and treatment options were so limited. Adler prescribed one drug that didn’t help. Love, who was about to go to college in Massachusetts, decided against the only other possibility at the time: long-term corticosteroids, which carry a host of side effects, including weight gain and mood swings. “I had come that far living through the attacks, and I wasn’t going to do it,” she said.  She joined the National Organization for Rare Disorders, a support and advocacy group, and met other HAE patients, which she said greatly helped. “It didn’t seem possible that anybody had been living the same bizarre reality I had,” she said.  Over the years Love has been involved in clinical trials of various experimental drugs. For the past four years she has self-administered infusions of Cinryze. The prophylactic therapy has largely eliminated Love’s attacks, but it remains one of the world’s most expensive prescription drugs, according to Forbes; a year’s supply costs about $350,000. Love said her insurance covers the cost. Before the last year’s federal health-care overhaul law abolished lifetime caps on coverage, she worried about burning through her $2 million limit.  Her 16-year-old son, she said, has tested negative for the disorder, while her 10-year-old daughter shows no signs of the problem but has not yet been tested.  Love said that despite her ordeal, she doesn’t wish she had been spared the disorder that has shaped her life. “I gained a lot of attributes having to live with it and through it,” she said. “It definitely made me who I am.”  If you have a medical mystery that’s been solved, we’d like to hear about it.

t5_2qh33,wmsalfiacarla,1322646762,"Hanukkah vodka ad pulled after protests from Jewish groups By Elizabeth Flock A New York City billboard advertising cheap vodka with the slogan “Christmas Quality, Hanukkah Pricing” was taken down after the company received a number of complaints from customers, as well as from the Anti-Defamation League. The Wódka vodka promotion features two dogs, one in a Santa hat and the other in a yarmulke.   (Anti-Defamation League ) “In a crude and offensive way of trying to make a point that their vodka is high quality and inexpensive, the billboards evoke a Jewish holiday to imply something that is cheap and of lesser value when compared to the higher value of a Christian holiday,” ADL regional director Ron Meier said. It “reinforces anti-Semitic stereotypes.”  The creative lead on the campaign, Brian Gordon, says he is Jewish and the campaign wasn’t intended to be offensive. He says the ad wanted to convey that Hanukkah was an “understated” holiday.  “As a Jew growing up, the only thing we could say was we had eight nights, and Christmas had only day, so we had eight days for the price of one,” he told CNN. “With our brand, our message is you can get more for less, eight nights versus one, and we don't need to wrap ourselves in fancy packaging.”  The vodka company has been unapologetic for its shock advertising in the past, with ads that read: “Hamptons Quality. Newark Pricing” and “Escort Quality. Hooker Pricing.” This time, Wódka sang a different tune:   By	 Elizabeth Flock  |  09:03 AM ET, 11/23/2011   Tags:  National, Ads, Hannukah, Christmas    inShare Tumblr Reddit Stumbleupon Digg Delicious  Previous: Helicopter crashes installing Christmas tree; pilot limps away (Video)  Next: Anne McCaffrey, sci-fi author of Pern series, is dead  Weigh In Discussion Policy About Discussions, Badges  LOG INREGISTER + SHARE THIS DEBATE You are not logged in.

t5_2qh87,georedd,1322654117,"most serious reviews of the Viking landers made with the hindsight of biological and mars chemistry knowledge we have now now say they found life on mars in the 70's  Life on mars was detected.   from the man who designed the exepriment http://www.gillevin.com/ ""Dr. Levin proposed to NASA and was selected for the Viking Mission to Mars.  He was designated Experimenter of the Viking Labeled Release life detection experiment which landed on Mars in 1976.  The experiment got positive responses at both Viking landing sites.  However, a consensus did not accept his results as proof of life.  After years of study, in 1997 Dr. Levin concluded that the experiment had, indeed, detected life on the red planet, and published his conclusion.  Subsequent findings of environmental conditions on Mars and research on extreme environments on Earth have been consistent with his claim.  Pursuing the life issue, Dr. Levin was a member of the Scientific Instrument Team for NASA’s experiment on the ill-fated Russian ’96 Mars Mission.  He has since developed, proposed and published on a Chiral LR life detection experiment as a way to remove any doubt about the original Mars LR results.  He has published over 120 papers in scientific and technology journals, and has been awarded more than 50 patents for his inventions""  http://news.discovery.com/space/viking-mars-organics-experiment.html     Viking Found Organics on Mars, Experiment Confirms     Using Mars-like soil taken from Atacama Desert, a study confirms Mars has organics, and Viking found them.    http://www.solstation.com/life/marslife.htm  Signs of Life?  On August 6, 2009, scientists studying and modelling observed variations in Martian methane emissions announced that the gas was being produced and destroyed much faster on Mars than can be explained with known Earth processes (Mars Express news Release; Jessica Griggs, News Scientist, August 5, 2009; Judith Burns, BBC News, August 5, 2009; and Lefèvre and Forget, Nature, 2009).  © 2009 Nature Publishing Group, Lefèvre and Forget, 2009    Larger illustration.     Martian atmospheric methane is being produced and destroyed faster than would be expected from known Earth processes (more).  On January 15, 2009, a team of scientists (including Michael Mumma, Geronimo Villanueva, Robert Novak, Tilak Hewagama, Boncho Bonev, Michael Disanti, Avi Mandell, and Michael Smith) announced the confirmation of three hot spots of repeated methane emissions north of the Martian equator during local summers (NASA press release; Science@NASA; Mumma et al, 2009; Rachel Courtland, New Scientist, January 15, 2009; and Marc Kaufman, Washington Post, January 16, 2009). Detected by three scientific teams since 2003, methane plumes were vented from areas exhibiting evidence of ancient ground ice or flowing water (at a rift called Nili Fossae, a flat cratered region in the large upland region of Arabia Terra known as Terra Sabae, and the southeastern region of Syrtis Major, an ancient volcano about 745 miles or 1,200 kilometers across). They were unable to resolve from the methane emissions and other data whether Mars is either biologically or geologically active. If Martian microbes are producing the methane, however, they may reside far below the surface where it can be warm enough for liquid water to exist. On Earth, bacteria have been found some 1.2 to 1.9 miles (1.9 to 3.1 km) beneath the Witwatersrand basin of South Africa, where natural radioactivity breaks down water molecules into oxygen and hydrogen, which can be used biologically for energy. On the other hand, on Earth, the conversion of iron oxide into the serpentine group of minerals can also create methane, and on Mars this process would use water, carbon dioxide, and the planet's internal heat (more discussion of methane detections below under Signs of Life?).  Methane emissions have found at three locations north of the Martian equator (more).  In papers published in 2006 and 2007, two planetary scientists speculated that microbes relying on a mixture of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and water (H2O) in their intracellar fluid might be able survive the thin, cold, dry atmosphere on Mars. Life that uses hydrogen peroxide has been found to exist on Earth (i.e., bombardier beetles and the soil bacterium Acetobacter peroxidans), and such life would be better able to absorb what little water is available from the rarified Martian atmosphere. Such life may also be consistent with the ambiguous results coming out from the life-detecting experiments aboard the 1970s Viking Landers; to date, no purely chemical explanation for the results of the Viking life-seeking experiments has been found, nor is there an explanation for the gas exchange experiment (which released carbon dioxide (CO2) and molecular nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2)), the pyrolitic release experiment (which broke down organic material), and and the labeled release experiment. An interesting ramification, however, is that H2O2 life would probably be easily killed by liquid water. (For more discussion, see: Lee Pullen, November 26, 2007; Doug Ellison, August 24, 2007; Astronomy Picture of the Day; and Houtkooper and Schulze-Makuch, 2007 and 2006).    more.................... At a late April 2010, Nasa-sponsored conference on Astrobiology, a NASA Mars Meteorite Research Team presented new evidence supporting its 1996 assertion that a 4-billion-year-old meteorite from Mars which landed thousands of years ago on Antarctica shows evidence of microscopic life on Mars. In addition to new evidence disproving counter-claims of non-biological origins for the ""biomorphs"" in meteorite ALH84001 (which may be mini-fossils of single-celled organisms or pits and textures formed by long-gone bacteria colonies), the team reported that additional Martian meteorites appear to house distinct and identifiable microbial fossils that point even more strongly to the past existence of life on Mars (Marc Kaufman, Washington Post, May 4, 2010; and NASA Johnson Space Center news release of November 25, 2009, with additional images and links to papers; ""Life on Mars Hypothesis"" presentation; Mckay et al, 2009; and Thomas-Keprta et al, 2009).  and more at..............  http://www.solstation.com/life/marslife.htm ",©

And because Japan is a few steps further away than most cultures, there is going to be a lot more confusion and misunderstanding, hence the Crazy Japan™ stuff riddling Western pop culture.  Now, there is a pervasive attitude towards animals these days that is less like that of master and companion and more like owner and handbag. For that reason, I am entirely unsurprised that some bullshit like this exists in Japan. (I am equally unsurprised that it exists in the US, too, but for entirely different reasons.) This isn't even the worst of it. I have heard stories of people going on vacation and coming back to find a little doggie corpse, because it didn't occur to them that they needed to provide food or make arrangements to have them looked after while they were away. They didn't need to feed their other toys, after all!  In any case, you will notice that I qualified my original statement above with ""a lot of"" so as not to include the entire Japanese race. I could have been more specific, and written ""a lot of modern, city-dwelling Japanese of a certain mold,"" but I thought the implication was clear enough. I agree with you , this is r/japan, and sometimes a motherfucker's gonna generalize about some motherfucking Japanese people. Deal with it.
