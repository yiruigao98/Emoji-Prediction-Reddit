t5_2qh63,barron224,1333248825,"Anyone look at her bio on the side? It's rich:  &gt; I am Hot Chick living in Parker, CO with my fabulous family and my Giant Schnauzer. I'm a U.S. Navy vet, and I currently work as a Senior Systems Engineer for a major manufacturer of telecommunications equipment. I specialize in VoIP and Contact Center technologies, so if you have a bad experience with a contact center, it's probably my fault. I care about science, the U.S. Constitution and the military. I'm a tax and spend liberal in a largely red county, but I try not to be stabby about it. I'm a perennial student currently attending the University of Denver, and I donate knitted cold weather gear to various charities. Stupidity, cupidity and wanton assholery piss me off, and I'm more than a little soft when it comes to dogs and those who serve others. I blog about whatever I feel like. I use foul language, so if that sort of thing offends you, feel free to fuck off now - if I'm unwilling to clean up my language for my fabulous Great Auntie Margie, I'm unlikely to do so for you. Newcomers are welcome here, especially those who disagree with me, but trolling and spamming will be met with the Shovel of Doom‚Ñ¢.  Now the two points that jumped out at me were:   &gt; I care about science, **the U.S. Constitution**...I'm a **tax and spend liberal**.  And she lambastes libertarians for ""not knowing history"".  Also notice the unapologetic collectivism:   &gt; I'm more than a little soft when it comes to dogs and those **who serve others**.  Now, I have nothing against people who serve others, I think it is noble, but I think it is a little telling that she specifically points out that she likes people who sacrifice themselves for others.  Another strawman that pisses me off is when she talks about how individualists don't appreciate the work of others. Individuals have absolutely no problem with deriving benefits from others so long as it is through a voluntary exchange.",‚Ñ¢

Issa asked the TSA rep about the total number of employees, the exponential growth of the agency, the large percentage (25%) of administrative jobs, and expanded waiting times at airports.  The TSA rep was confused by most of this basic information.  There was a dissenting voice, sort of -- a GAO representative.  Among many damning statistics, his office ranked the TSA in the bottom 5% of federal gov't jobs (I don't recall the exact criteria).  So compared to other agencies, we're truly dealing with some of the dullest minds in DC -- performing work that's neither desirable nor rewarding.  There was a lot of focus the employee badge system, apparently an over-funded nonfunctional program for ""high tech"" identification of TSA workers.  Only two Congressmen really dug in hard.

This is an amazingly lazy shuck to avoid definition of your beliefs beyond bumper-stick slogans and Von Mises talking points. The truth is resilient. The truth stands well against any level of scrutiny. If you were certain that your political beliefs were firmly based in reality, you‚Äôd gladly provide a wealth of empirical evidence to support your conclusions. You have not done this because your claims are unsubstantiated and flimsy.  &gt; You seem to believe that war, loss of civil liberties, the surveillance state, the nanny state, the police state, and broken monetary policy are our only choices to vote for, which is just plain wrong.  I‚Äôm able to acknowledge that politics are imperfect. I‚Äôm not a Utopian. That doesn‚Äôt mean that I want to live in an Orwellian nightmare or would prefer to be enslaved by massive surveillance and corporatism. It means that I know that society works as a balancing act composed of countless counter-forces. It means that I accept complexity beyond ideology and am not so na√Øve as to believe in my own ideas above that which has actually been tested.  **You wanna get nuts? Let‚Äôs get nuts!**  Take off the training wheels and let your Libertarian freak-flag fly. I want you and the rest to participate in a mass-migration to an ungoverned territory. This should be a place where there is no government for you to blame for all your woes.  Establish your form of government, live by it, and own the results. Show the rest of the world that it doesn‚Äôt just look good on paper but is actually a functional form of government. The Communists assumed all of the risks and costs associated with testing the ideas of Marxism, and history shows how that worked out. Marxists were wrong, but don‚Äôt assume that the exact opposite is somehow correct.  &gt; It'd be one thing if you just ""gotta make sacrifices"" and you ""can't have everything you want,"" I get that. But what we have now is institutionalized corruption and Crony Capitalism.  You have the audacity to cry out against ‚ÄúCrony Capitalism‚Äù in a thread linking to a video of Rand Paul defending Oil Subsidies? This, after I pointed out that even the CATO Institute (Founded by one of the [Koch Brothers]( http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/peopleandpower/2011/10/2011102683719370179.html) and Murray-Fucking-Rothbard) disagrees with Rand on this issue. Are you really so fact-adverse? You can still go on believing in Libertarianism if you admit that you and Rand Paul are on the wrong side of this issue. Your grandiose notions of anti-war small government Utopia are not even at stake here. Fuck.  &gt; It's not a valid political system and it's completely indefensible.  Indefensible? It is the system we have. The world holds its breath waiting for you to create some kind of Paulistine Utopia for the rest of us to model our society after.  **TIME FOR AN ALLEGORY**  ‚ÄúCars powered by gasoline are contributing to ruthless dictatorships, they pollute the environment, deep-water drilling has devastated natural habitats for countless sea-life, and gives too much power and wealth to a controlling class in our country! Our dependence on fossil fuels must end!‚Äù  ‚ÄúHow about a hybrid-electric car? They get good gas mileage, right?‚Äù  ‚ÄúNot good enough! Using *some* gasoline means supporting *some* dictatorship and destroying *some* of the environment. How can you support something so awful?!‚Äù  ‚ÄúWell, I need a car to get around, I have a job to commute to and need transportation. Using less gas is a step in the right direction, you can‚Äôt just change things like this over night, it took a century to get to this point and getting rid of fossil fuels now would be a disaster.‚Äù  ‚ÄúRon Paul believes cars shouldn‚Äôt us gasoline at all.‚Äù  ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs all well and good, but unless he has something to replace gasoline with I don‚Äôt see how‚Ä¶‚Äù  ‚ÄúRon Paul believes in the Constitution. The founding fathers never supported cars running on internal combustion.‚Äù  ‚ÄúThe founding fathers lived in an era of dirt roads and used horses for transportation.‚Äù  ‚ÄúIf you vote for Ron Paul, we can stop running cars on gasoline.‚Äù  ‚ÄúIf not gasoline, then what will cars run on?‚Äù  ‚ÄúHere are some YouTube videos showing a car that runs on water! We can run cars on water!‚Äù  ‚ÄúHow do you even know that this works?‚Äù  ‚ÄúI believe in creativity and innovation, you hate creativity and want to keep things the way they are!‚Äù  ‚ÄúWoah, buddy! Just because I‚Äôm skeptical about running car engines on water instead of gasoline doesn‚Äôt mean that I‚Äôm against the idea, I just want evidence that something like this even works.‚Äù  ‚ÄúBack in the late 1800s all kinds of things ran on water, haven‚Äôt you ever heard of Steam Power?‚Äù  ‚ÄúYeah I studied engineering at the University of Maryland and have an EE degree, you seem to be confused about how Steam Power actually works, the combustion of coal or other fossil fuels were needed to generate the steam in these engines, returning to that kind of fuel has all kinds of negative consequences, things would be much worse.‚Äù  ‚ÄúBut this YouTube video doesn‚Äôt show it like that, the car runs on 100% water.‚Äù  ‚ÄúIf that were true, then I‚Äôm sure someone would have already done it.‚Äù  ‚ÄúThe Big Three in Detroit won‚Äôt let them. Ron Paul will get rid of the Big Three and let the free market decide what we use to fuel our cars. Barack Obama wants to keep us dependent, Ron Paul wants‚Ä¶‚Äù  ‚ÄúDoes Ron Paul have any experience in building water-powered engines?‚Äù  ‚ÄúRon Paul believes in creativity and innovation, Ron Paul knows that if we end government regulation of the Auto-Industry that water-fueled cars will replace gasoline engines. Vote for Ron Paul!‚Äù  ‚ÄúYou still don‚Äôt have any proof that cars can even run on water.‚Äù  ‚ÄúDuh, I already told you, we used steam power all the time in the 1800‚Äôs‚Äù  ‚ÄúYeah and the burning of coal was very harmful to the environment, for decades countless coal miners were killed, coal is a finite resource just like oil, steam-powered engines are not a practical answer to the current price of oil.‚Äù  ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe that you‚Äôd support big oil. You want to keep US-friendly petro-states in power. You support Saudi Oil barons and thugs like Hugo Chavez and Vladimir Putin with your gas-powered vehicle. You hate creativity and innovation.‚Äù  ‚ÄúI really don‚Äôt think it is that simple. Fuel alternatives are a complex issue, right now we have technology that will help us to use less fuel and electric vehicles with limited range will probably be a good alternative for some people. Can you name any cars on the market that run purely on water?‚Äù  ‚ÄúThat question isn‚Äôt fair! How can we get cars that run on water if you won‚Äôt let us get government out of the business of regulating the automotive industry? If the government would get out of the way and let the free market provide us with water-fueled cars we wouldn‚Äôt even be having this discussion.‚Äù  ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre really so sure that this will work, why don‚Äôt you assume the risk and costs and start building water-fueled cars yourself?‚Äù  ‚ÄúThe government would never let that happen. We need Ron Paul to end the federal government‚Äôs death-grip on the free market. Only then will water-fueled cars be able to enter the market.‚Äù  **END ALLEGORY**  &gt; What's your explanation for why Obama didn't restore everything to its proper place for when he and the Dems had supermajority?  Are you kidding me? A few things off the top of my head:  Democrats rarely (if ever) do anything in lock-step. Go look back at any piece of legislation and you‚Äôll find that even if the overwhelming majority of Democrats vote ‚ÄúYay‚Äù there are always a few ‚ÄúNay‚Äù votes in the mix. A common political joke goes something like this: *I‚Äôm not a member of an organized political party, I‚Äôm a Democrat.*  Next, considering the fact that something as vital as reforming healthcare results in bark-at-the-moon pundits crying out all kinds of nonsense about ‚Äúsocialism‚Äù or ‚Äúdeath-panels‚Äù and you‚Äôve got a whole lot of senior citizens (already receiving government-funded healthcare by the way) scared shitless. They all start writing and calling their local officials demanding that they vote no for ‚ÄúObamacare‚Äù.  Obama wasn‚Äôt elected as ‚ÄúKing‚Äù of the United States, and the legislative process is not historically renowned for being the swiftest branch of government. Do I even need to point out the rabid over-use/abuse of the filibuster? Even with a majority vote in both houses, many pieces of legislation simply died because Republicans decided to filibuster.  Then you‚Äôve got to think about those Blue-Dog southern Democrats that are basically Diet-Republicans (GOP-lite‚Ñ¢) and the fact that if someone like Ronald Reagan were running in the 2012 race, he‚Äôd probably be a member of the Democratic-Socialist Party given how far to the right politics have moved in this country. For fuck sake, the individual mandate now being ruled on in a Supreme Court hearing was first proposed by Republicans under George H. W. Bush in 1989.  Democrats are not nearly as ‚Äúleftist‚Äù as many conservatives have been lead to believe. Period. ",‚Ñ¢

t5_2rc19,Oryhara1344,1333324765,"Disappointing ending or not, I would totally play a Mass Effect RTS, set concurrently with ME3. I think it'd be best done as hybrid space/ground, similar to Empire at War but with realtime interaction between the two ""layers."" Multiple simultaneous fronts (Sins of a Solar Empire, anyone?) would be intriguing, but possibly too chaotic unless it went the turn-based route.  I'd definitely want multiple campaigns. A Systems Alliance campaign could start with the fall of Earth and the ensuing guerrilla war, with lots of time sensitive hit-and-run missions and a limited supply of forces. After a certain point, the player's POV would switch from Anderson to Hackett, where you're commanding the Alliance military as a whole. A finite supply of fleet resources would be a nice story-driven gameplay element, and if it was handled similarly to Homeworld 2 I'd be all for it.  The turians started off with a sizable military, but were caught off guard almost as badly as the humans. A turian campaign could consist of fighting on and around Palaven and Menae. We saw slightly more of that conflict than we did Anderson and Hackett's adventures over the course of ME3, but there's a lot left to be explored.  The asari would make for a nice third campaign, starting you off on slightly stronger ground than the turians or humans, but with less of a standing military than either. I envision it as a long slog of a defensive war, even more so than the fight on Palaven or Earth. Constantly falling back with a last stand on Thessia, that sort of thing.  After all three of these campaigns are completed, the fourth campaign becomes available: the fight to retake Earth. You'd once more take on the role of Hackett, with command over all of the fleets.   It'd tie into your ME1/2/3 save files, and all the choices you made throughout the games would have just as much of an effect on the RTS as they did on ME3's story. Depending on your actions, krogans would assist your troops on Palaven, STG units would become available, the Destiny Ascension would be a player-controlled unit in the battle for Earth... Maybe we'd even see some rachni in action this time around.  EDIT: Another campaign that'd work? The quarians fighting their way into the Perseus Veil, with the end of the campaign occurring just as they push the geth back to Rannoch. Their involvement, along with the geth's, would also be determined by player choice.  EDIT 2: Oh, and no matter what choices you make in the game and how well you do, you still get whatever Space Magic‚Ñ¢ your character got at the end of ME3.",‚Ñ¢

t5_2qh03,ejjz,1333337138,"There is a mod for BF1942 named [Battlefield Pirates](http://www.bfpirates.com/). They have a version for Battlefield 2, too. Unfortunately, the technology for modding ""isn't there yet"" for frostbite. Apparently they have made their destruction system so complicated that they can't write a manual on it, so for user convenience they wont release any mod tools at all.  This is of course not the real reason (I ramble), however I remember some DICE dev saying in an interview that ""everything is too complicated for modders to get a grip of"". This is just utter bullshit, though, since the mod community have shown time after time that they actually innovate and piss on the devs when it comes to creating the content for the finished engine.  [Empires mod (Wayback machine)](http://web.archive.org/web/20040401142732/http://www.empiresmod.com/about.html), for example. It let you have a commander (in BF1942), that watched over the battlefield, could place buildings (barracks that people could spawn in, armories that had ammo and health boxes, refineries over geysers to collect resources so you could build more, basic RTS stuff), while the soldiers were actual people playing. It was very buggy and at first, but the head dev back then was a fucking magician with them config files and it got really good and was appreciated by the community. It eventually moved on to the Far Cry engine (for a little while), and is currently on the Half Life 2 engine. I haven't played it in a while, though.  You also have [Galactic Conquest](http://www.moddb.com/mods/battlefield-galactic-conquest) (also for BF1942), which also was a total conversion. To Star Wars, complete with drivable AT-ST (two-legged walker), Millennium Falcon, X-Wing and a lot of other things (although I believe the AT-AT (four-legged walker) was not in the mod). My favorite map was definitely the assault on Hoth (which had a destructible home base for the rebels). Oh, the fun! Ninja edit: This mod also had space battle maps. Death Star also featured.  (Desert Combat needs no introduction since it's almost as known as BF1942, at least if you back up a couple of years)  It's so sad that the developers are forced to lie. The mod tools are not made because modders can't handle the engine. The mod tools are not made because of money. Fucking money. Why would we buy expensive DLC's if there were free mods? And the game franchise would get locked up forever since everyone would ""refuse to buy the sequels"". Idiots. I hate it. Games should be about fun, not about money. Even though money controls everything and it's big boy EA top bosses who decides and they are cigar smoking, whiskey drinking golf players with monocles and the same attitude as [Cornelius Hawthorne](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peZaQ_7GFoU).

t5_2stjd,krugmanisapuppet,1333342152," the best thing that pops up immediately is the AMA's lobbying budget on opensecrets.org:  http://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/summary.php?id=D000000068  which only goes back to 1990.   it's more likely you'd have to crawl through their budget documents as part of a coordinated study.  technically, the AMA is a  501(c)(6):  &gt; A 501(c)(6) business league may further its exempt purposes through lobbying as its primary activity without jeopardizing its exempt status. However, a 501(c)(6) organization that engages in lobbying may be required to either provide notice to its members regarding the percentage of dues paid that are applicable to lobbying activities, or pay a proxy tax.   any lobbying association is there to represent a corporate interest receiving favors from Congress - or about to.  here's their annual report:  http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/about-ama/ama-annual-report.page  for 2010...after 11 pages of filler, we get to the budget material.   total ""general and administrative expenses"" in 2010 were $238,000,000, with a revenue of $278,000,000.    their net expensese are broken down into ""Core Operations"", ""Administration, Operations &amp; Overhead"", ""Amagine^TM"", ""Governance"", ""Restructuring Changes.""  Amagine is an IT system*.  ""Core Operations"" is broken down into this:  &gt; Core Operations includes three groups: Professional  Standards, Advocacy and Federation Relations and  Marketing and Communications.  &gt; Professional Standards includes Science, Medicine &amp;  Public Health; Clinical Quality Improvement, Clinical  Quality &amp; Patient Safety; Medical Education; Ethics;  and Grants. The various groups are involved in  developing AMA policies on scientific issues for the  House of Delegates; public health advocacy; defining  or influencing standards for undergraduate, graduate  and continuing medical education; establishing and  disseminating ethical standards for the profession;  providing support for the Councils on Ethical and  Judicial Affairs, Science and Public Health and  Medical Education; **influencing the public on  health problems;** quality of care and patient safety;  prevention and wellness; disaster preparedness; and  **eliminating health care disparities.** [how?] Advocacy and Federation Relations includes **federal  and state-level advocacy operations; private sector  advocacy;** economic, statistical and market research  to support advocacy efforts; political education  for physicians; and maintaining relations with the  federation of medicine. Marketing and Communications focuses its efforts  on **enhancing the AMA‚Äôs brand image; informing  the public about the AMA‚Äôs positions and policies;**  supporting the AMA‚Äôs advocacy efforts; and  maintaining member communications. Core Operations increased net expenses by $2.7  million or 5.5 percent in 2010. Advocacy net  spending was largely unchanged. Professional  Standards increased net spending by $1.4 million,  almost entirely due to expanding clinical quality  improvement efforts. Marketing and Communications  net expenses increased $1.1 million, most of which  related to increased media buys on the Medicare  reimbursement issue.  that's an increase.  not the spending itself.  ""Core Operations"" totals $48.8 million in expenses.  an additional $11.3 million is expended on the ""Governance"" operations, described as such:  &gt; Governance includes the Board of Trustees and  Officer Services and the House of Delegates (HOD)  and Professional Relations units. The Board  of Trustees expenses include costs related to  governance activities as well as expenses associated  with support of Advocacy, Professional Standards  and Marketing &amp; Communications. The HOD and  Professional Relations unit includes costs associated  with annual and interim meetings, groups and  sections and other HOD activities. In 2010, Governance net spending increased $0.2  million, with a $0.1 million increase in each of  the Board of Trustees and the HOD &amp; Professional  Relations units. The Board of Trustees unit spent  more on outside professional services, while the HOD area experienced higher travel and meeting costs,  mainly due to a more expensive venue for the interim  meeting than in the prior year.  their job is to sell out the medical profession.  huge sections of their operation are completely for-profit and corrupt.  these are mixed with functions that are partially useful, to give them the appearance of a benevolent organization.   *regarding Amagine:  http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/news/news/ama-introduces-amagine.page  &gt; AMA Introduces AMAGINE‚Ñ¢, Health IT Solutions Platform for Physicians  &gt; The AMAGINE physician platform has successfully completed pilot testing and is now available to physicians nationwide  &gt; For immediate release:  &gt;  April 19, 2011  &gt; Chicago ‚Äì Amagine, Inc., a subsidiary of the American Medical Association (AMA), today announced that its health information technology solutions platform, AMAGINE‚Ñ¢, is available to physicians nationwide. The unique platform provides physicians with a single point of access to more than 20 health information technology (health IT) solutions, knowledge and communication tools and consulting resources to help improve practice efficiency and patient care. Subscriptions to the AMAGINE‚Ñ¢ platform vary in price and can start from $20 per month per physician for electronic prescribing solutions to $300 per physician per month for electronic medical records systems.  &gt; ""Navigating the murky water of the health IT marketplace can be daunting and we are thrilled to be able to help physicians with the AMAGINE‚Ñ¢ physician platform,"" said Robert Musacchio, Ph.D, Senior Vice President, Business Product Solutions of Amagine, Inc. ""The AMAGINE‚Ñ¢ platform delivers tailored health IT solutions to medical practices to help physicians determine their practice needs, select the right system and qualify for federal health IT incentives.""  &gt; The AMAGINE‚Ñ¢ physician platform brings a plethora of health IT solutions to physicians, including three electronic medical record products, electronic prescribing software, claims management solutions, and clinical decision support and reference tools. Dr. First, Allscripts, DocSite, WellCentive, CareTracker, Quest Care360 and NextGen are just some of the top solutions providers available through the AMAGINE‚Ñ¢ platform. The AMAGINE‚Ñ¢ team continually reviews new services and solutions to ensure its products fit physicians‚Äô needs. AMAGINE‚Ñ¢ consultants provide physicians with a free practice assessment to determine their readiness to adopt health IT and then make tailored recommendations for the individual practice.   &gt; ‚ÄúThe free AMAGINE‚Ñ¢ practice assessment is an invaluable resource for physician practices,‚Äù said Mr. Musacchio. ‚ÄúBy having physicians answer a few simple questions, AMAGINE‚Ñ¢ consultants are able to help them identify their unique needs and make specific recommendations on how they can best incorporate health IT into their practice.‚Äù  all these ""solutions"" are ostensibly for-profit, even though the AMA is legally a non-profit, tax-exempt organization.   what appears to be happening here - although it is difficult to confirm - is that the American Medical Association is pushing for massive decreases in patient privacy in order to - essentially by mandate of law - incorporate patient records into its own proprietary, for-profit platform.  so to answer your question?  they lied about it back then, like they're lying about it today.  let me know if you track down a report - there are some places i don't want to search for one.  you could probably find one in a large enough library - i'm sure the budget breakdown was similar in many ways.",‚Ñ¢

What is he talking about? **What** libraries? What *are* libraries?  ;-)  Seriously... C++ (and C) *languages* have no notion of libraries. None whatsoever.

I can imagine e.g.      {       whatever();     }     catch(const exception&amp; e)     {     }  But that's too asymmetrical compared to a mere *try* at the front.

The Easter Bunny is missing ‚Äì presumed dead ‚Äì and the Easter eggs he left lying across RuneScape are the target of the Evil Chicken and Chocotrice‚Äôs wicked wager: to find out who can turn the greatest number of adorable little chicks into diabolically delicious snacks!   Report in to the Evil Chicken or the Chocatrice in Varrock square to find out when the next Easter egg hunt is starting. Once you‚Äôve pledged your allegiance to your chosen villain, you‚Äôll be gifted with a patented Eggsterminator¬Æ, which will turn the innocent chicks within the eggs into fried chicken drumsticks or chocotreats, depending on whether you have scotch eggs (for the Evil Chicken) or marshmallows (for the Chocotrice) selected in the Combat Styles tab.   Hunts are held on every odd hour (so, 9am BST, 11am BST, 1pm BST etc.) There are 5 eggs to find per hunt, and you have you have a little under 2 hours to find them. You may be able to convince the Evil Chicken or the Chocatrice to set you off in the right direction, but after that it‚Äôs down to you and your fellow players to find the rest. Breaking the eggs doesn‚Äôt stop other players from finding them, so it might be wise to work with some partners in crime. Join the EvilEggFind or ChocEggFind chat channels to find suitably unscrupulous associates.   If you seek out, hatch and destroy 3 chicks, and then hand the relevant treats to the bad-guy you‚Äôre backing, you‚Äôll earn the right to claim an egg or chocolate-themed mask, to show the world your shame (or lack thereof). You‚Äôll need 3 drumsticks for the egg on face mask, or 3 chocotreats for the chocolate egg on face mask.   Get all 5 eggs in a single hunt, and you‚Äôll earn a lamp giving you XP in the skill of your choice. You‚Äôll need to be a member to do this, as at least two of the eggs will always be in members-only areas.   Finally, RuneScape members among you finding all 5 eggs in a total of 3 hunts can claim a permanent version of the Eggsterminator. It‚Äôll be no yolk doing this, but persevere and you‚Äôll wreak eggy ruin across RuneScape for ever more.   Need more help?

t5_2qhkh,ndt,1333431081,"There's as many ways of doing it as there are people doing it. I did wholesale propagation of less common natives for the nursury trade and reclamation projects for several years and while this is probably excessive for most people who just want to take a couple of cuttings, I've rooted over 150 species of plants, shrubs and trees using this system. Obviously this is not going to work for some plants and other are better done as hardwood cuttings, etc. but this-will-root just-about-anything¬Æ including a lot of things that aren't suppose to root from softwood cuttings.  * Sanitize a razor blade, and pane of glass or other sterilizable cutting surface. * Take your cuttings when the stem just starts to harden slightly but is still fresh and limber, not woody. * With the razor cut a clean slice right below a leaf node at a 45 degree angle * Remove the bottom 2-3 sets of leaves and remove the top growing point. You should still have at least 3-4 leaves above ground. * Dip the trimmed portion in rooting hormone, I prefer dry but it doesn't matter. * Push a pencil into the rooting medium (1 part perlite, 1 part vermiculite, 1 part peat moss, a dash of time release fertilizer like ozmocote). Do not push the cutting into the medium as it will remove much of the hormone, drop it in a hole. * When all your cutting are in water it in to settle the medium.  OK, that's all pretty standard but here's the excessive part for most people but makes a huge difference.  * Put the cuttings under misters, in full sun but under shade cloth. The misters should come on for a second or two whenever the leaf surface dries out. That might be once every 10 min or once every 10 hours, it depends on conditions.  Rooting under mist in a high light environment I can get a manzanita cutting to be well rooted and ready to pot up in under two weeks and it's growing like gangbusters right from the start with nary a single cutting lost to rot. In the standard low light, stagnant humid environment like you get with a plastic dome next to a window, it can take twice as long and usually results in a significant number of lost cuttings and many things won't root at all.  Having done both, there is no comparison. ",¬Æ

Other than that, just make sure you have plenty of warm clothes and at least a moderately thick skin and/or a well developed sense of self-irony. We all love an American that makes self-deprecating jokes about all things American. We're less PC than most, but also not really as rude or mean as we easily appear to be. Casually mention how you can't stand George W. and you're mostly set. You can also freely joke about Russians, but sadly your jokes about Russians aren't likely very relevant to our jokes about Russians. We're practically commies anyway, just the better kind.   Of course we're capitalists too, but not the bad kind like all Americans.  What we most pride ourselves for is our modesty and complete lack of pride.  We're approximately 60-70% Americanized‚Ñ¢, thanks largely to Hollywood and MTV, but, in a true Slavic fashion, we're still also semi-professional self-loathers, so don't take any anti-Americanism as offense -- we're just built that way.  We're pretty much like Canada, except we're not wearing any pants.  We're relatively hard to approach and befriend, but once you break the ice, there tends to be good fish for a long time. (See, to a Finn, that does make sense. We have lots of ice, so fish tend to be under it most of the time. This can work as some kind of an analogy too if you're into that sort of thing. If not, that's OK, we have nothing against straight people either.)  Shit tends to work most of the time. If not, there's usually a number you can call in to complain until they send someone over to fix whatever it is that is not working. This usually costs (next to) nothing.  Railways are the one exception to the above rule. Expect to be late or to have to take a bus instead.  Beneath all the petty bickering and bitching, we're overall pretty liberal and tolerant.  Take off your shoes when entering anyone's home, though.  There's at least one MacDonalds in pretty much every self-respecting little town or district of a larger city (we call anything with around 100k or more habitants a large city). Starbucks-equivalents are popping up all over the place too, not to mention all the more (or less) traditional Old World style bars and cafes that have always been and will always be a permanent part of the landscape of virtually every city block, village, camping area and gas station.  Don't be extremely fat and loud all the time and we won't treat you as a caricature.  For extra points, learn a few key phrases like *kiitos, tuoppi, vittu, perkele, saatana* and *teksasilainen lehmipoika etsii estotonta naisseuraa*.  Visit some rock festivals if you possibly can. These are about as crazy Finns will ever get, with the possible exception of weekend cruises to Estonia. Bars may be a good starting point to tip in your toe first. Helsinki has a metric fuckton of bars and clubs with live music pretty much every day of the week, whether you're into classical, jazz, rock, pop, iskelm√§ (the local country variant), any kind of EDM, or something else completely. A bit more quiet on the zeuhl front, though.  It's OK to be quiet for a while and just vegetate. It's not awkward unless *you* make it awkward. (Now try not to make it awkward.)  Whatever relationship you have with God, better keep it to yourself in order to not seem like a bible belt hillbilly on a holy crusade (we're generally kind of private about matters of faith in that way). Whatever relationship you *don't* have with God, feel free to come out but don't expect it to make you in any way special.  Also try to visit someone's summer cottage if at all possible, preferably way too far from the city and by a lake somewhere, with a wood-heated sauna and annoying neighbors that come over to socialize way too often and way too drunk. These are the most interesting kind of people you'll meet outside any historical comedy.  As everywhere, girls and women tend to find exotic guys more interesting, which definitely gives you an advantage if you're interested in abusing our quasi-Scandinavian na√Øvete.

t5_2t5qh,drugsrbad,1333474060,"**Zeus: Master of Olympus &amp; Poseidon: Master of Atlantis - PC -** While Impressions Games is no longer around (meaning you can pirate without guilt, plus it's long out of production and not on steam), Zeus and its expansion Poseidon, continue to be the best historical city builders ever. Features some pretty interesting GRRL POWER in Athena (and Artemis as well who is a strong independent goddess who will destroy your enemies. Also has some very subtle (but numerous) references to pop culture.   **Children of the Nile - PC/Steam -** Zeus too Greek for you? No problemo, Children of the Nile is here and will put pyramids all over your silly temples. It's not as broad as Zeus is, but it is deep. Pyramid building is (obviously) the main draw, but managing your city's economy is fairly addictive. For history nerds, it's a lot more realistic and accurate that Zeus which is its own draw in and of itself.  **Caesar 3 - PC -** Pretty much the gameplay of Children of the Nile in Rome. Like CotN, it's not as broad as Zeus, but much deeper than CotN, and holds a special place in many people's gaming memories.   **Civ City: Rome/Caesar 4 - PC/Steam -** I've put them together since they're both roughly identical, although only Civ City: Rome is available on Steam. Both being 3D Rome city sims, they have similar gameplay elements and production teams (honestly the historical city builder world is pretty incestuous), your choice is honestly based on personal preference. Having said all that, they aren't as deep or broad and the games I have previously listed, and they are *very* fun, but I feel like they're missing the ""spark"" of the older city builders and CotN.   **Cities In Motion - PC/Steam -** And now for something completely different! This is a ""transit management simulator"", meaning you control a public transit company and build bus/train/subway/boat lines in a European city somewhere. Being a Paradox game, it's ridiculously complex and if you want to spend hours mastering a challenging strategy game this is perfect. Of course, if you're like me and just want to set up a Metro line and watch it run around town, you can do that too. If you're a Red Blooded American(‚Ñ¢), there is DLC so you can play in a US city.   **Sid Meier's Railroads - PC/Steam -** THIS GAME. I'm not sure how many hours I've sunk into this but it's probably in the hundreds. Essentially there's this great big undeveloped map for you build a massive rail empire on. What's great is you can follow the scenario goals or just go at your own pace and the game won't punish you for it (which is what I did when I was just starting out). If you're heard of the Railroad Tycoon series, this is ultimate itineration of the train-sim genre.   **Sim City 4 - PC -** Did Herman Cain's 9-9-9 tax proposal interest you? Well he may be out of the race but at least you can have your 9-9-9 tax rate in the most popular modern city builder ever. I'm not going to write much on it because many people have already done so and better, but it's a great game if history just doesn't do it for you.   **Metropolismania - PS2 -** It's wacky and Japanese and *incredibly poorly translated*, and it is a ton of fun. You're a guy in a yellow suit who uses the power of PERSONAL CONNECTIONS to build a city of the future.   I'm kind of running out of simulation games to extol, so here are some games in completely different genres that I love to bits:  **Borderlands - PC/Steam/PS3/360 -** A sci-fi space shooter that doesn't take itself seriously. What's not to like? Oh right, the problematic token characters (the black guy and the girl *eyeroll*). But if you can get past that, it's a ton of fun and one of the better co-op games out there. Not sold on it? It has Claptrap, one of the best one-wheeled robotic mascot characters ever.   **Plants vs. Zombies - PC/Steam/iOS -** It's silly, it's hard, it's a casual game, it's got anthropomorphic plants, it's fun. I paid $3 to get it on my phone and it's the best $3 I ever spent.  **Shadow of the Colossus - PS2 -** The game that will make you cry, and that's just at the desolate beauty of the environment. It's on many people's Best Games Ever Period lists for a reason. Also try the prequel (maybe prequel? maybe not...) Ico, which has some frustrating mechanics (why is there a button to drop a weapon if you can't get another?!) but is still a very good game.   **Tales of Symphonia/Tales of the Abyss - GCN and PS2/3DS -** The Tales series is widely beloved by JRPG fans for a reason. Tales of Symphonia, and to a lesser extent Abyss, deals heavily with themes of alienation, discriminations, and lots of social justice-y themes very admirably. The major differences: Symphonia's story is a lot less 'mature' but is more engaging than Abyss'; the combat system is arguably better in Abyss but they're both roughly the same; the characters are a bit more likeable in Abyss; Abyss is much longer than Symphonia, and as such, it takes forever for the Leading Dude to stop being whiney (but his big character changing moment is worth it); and lastly, Symphonia is a better introduction to the series despite dated graphics. Abyss was recently rereleased on the 3DS, but I've only really played the PS2 version, so I can't say how good the port is.   **Digital Devil Saga 1&amp;2 - PS2 -** A Shin Megami Tensei spinoff game, DDS is hard to play through due to the opressively depressing atmosphere and the frustrating grind, but it has some very fascinating characters, great voice acting, and a compelling story.  I apologize for the tl;dr, but these are all great games. :D",‚Ñ¢

P‚ù§m Wonderful Presents: The Greatest Movie Ever Sold was fascinating to me.  I have a few questions relating to this film.  1.  When you were initially contacting advertisers over the phone you had some difficulty getting any of them to bite.  Do you think this was because documentaries don't draw as large an audience as feature films, the premise of the film itself was unconventional and possibly uncomfortable for a company to get behind, your reputation, or a mix of any or all of these factors/something else.   2.  Do you think it would have been possible to make this film before the success of Super Size Me and other projects?   3.  Do you think it would be better if the U.S. had laws like S√£o Paulo and could not advertise outdoors?  Or do you think that they are important to the aesthetics of our country and provide some of the beauty and cultural identity we have.  I.E. Some advertisements are beautiful but do you think we would be better off focusing artistic expression on art as art, not art as ads; or artistic expression through architecture?   4.

t5_2t5sa,scartol,1333544664,"Perhaps ""anxious"" isn't the right word; I probably should have said I'm aware of the potential and always on the lookout for it. That said, you may be right about whether I've got the WMB or not. (I expect I'm not the best one to judge such a thing. Although I might add that a person on the internet who's only ever read one thing I've written may not be perfectly positioned to make such a judgment either, heh.)  There's no doubt that I see some of myself in Mr. Russell, and I won't deny that I feel compelled in some ways to defend the guy. But I've presented a gaggle of critical quotes with which I agree criticizing the guy (and therefore my own tendencies and potential).   &gt;You say you act in solidarity but in spite of the reactions of Uganda at large (that you truncate into one quote, the shortest, after giving two to white men) you say that you can't take sides on this issue  I'm not claiming any sort of solidarity with the people of Uganda, because I've never been there and know virtually nothing about it. That was a reference to my work with the people of East Timor.  I think you're right that I've given short shrift to voices from Uganda, but elsewhere in my blog post I most certainly *do* take a side on the issue of Kony 2012:  &gt;The video was a viral sensation, and for the first time in my 12 years of teaching, I was approached by students who wanted to learn more about what was going on in central Africa. I spent a day showing my classes an excerpt of *Kony 2012* and discussing some of its points (and some things it leaves out). I discussed it at length with friends and family. I responded to Facebook comments and Reddit threads.  &gt;This whole affair has resonated strongly with me, for reasons I‚Äôll make clear in the final section. For now I will simply say that I care deeply about human rights and political awareness; they have been core elements of my pedagogical ontology both inside and outside the classroom for my entire adult life. I was (and continue to be) impressed by the popularity of the *Kony 2012* campaign, and I believe it is ultimately a good thing.  I tried not to make this about me, but as a teacher I do see the video from a different perspective than most of the people with whom I've been discussing it.   &gt;did you really just ask the question as to whether or not he could keep that promise, ever ever, ever ever? He can't change the world, but it's not because because he's not trying very hard  The question I asked is: Can he keep his promise about ""stopping"" the LRA? Again, I'm skeptical, and I share your criticism that he's putting himself in a position of Rescue Man‚Ñ¢. But I think the guy deserves a little credit for dedicating his life to this work, and for obviously working with [lots and lots of Ugandans](http://www.invisiblechildren.com/our-team.html). (I think the dozens of people from Uganda on that page surpasses any pretense to tokenism, don't you?) There is, of course, not one monolithic Ugandan voice.   Furthermore, we should remember that our world's [sensitive dependence on initial conditions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_effect) means that we change the world all the time in all sorts of ways. Do I wish IC had less paternalism in the movie, and/or involved folks from Uganda more in the production of the film, telling their own stories, etc? Yes, absolutely ‚Äî you and I are totally in agreement there. But considering the tendency of most Americans (especially Christian missionaries) to blind themselves to human rights atrocities in Africa, I think it's cool that he's trying to do the right thing.  Let me ask you a question: Can you give me some examples of folks who are doing real solidarity work of the kind you would prefer to see championed by IC and others?  &gt;Let's say Kony2012 really succeeds, and the Ugandan military gets a bunch of money to arrest a former warlord. What does that accomplish?  A good question. Let's start by remembering that [the US government actively resisted the creation of the ICC](http://www.globalpolicy.org/empire/us-un-and-international-law-8-24/us-opposition-to-the-icc-8-29.html). I'm not a Maoist, but I do often think of his [maxim](http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Mao_Zedong#Quotations_from_Chairman_Mao_Zedong_.28The_Little_Red_Book.29.281964.29): ""We shall support whatever our enemies oppose and oppose whatever our enemies support."" (I would add that I don't see myself as an enemy of the US government, but rather its many misguided policies, etc etc.)  How did folks in Africa react to the recent conviction of Thomas Lubanga at the ICC? I found [this article](http://africanpress.me/2012/03/24/icc-verdict-on-lubanga-hailed-why-not-bring-nkunda-to-icc-also-he-committed-the-same-crimes/) from API featuring reactions from people who had been targets of his atrocities.  &gt;Francis Tumba Pandemoya who fled Bunia, the main town in the northeastern region of Ituri where Lubanga‚Äôs forces were active, said: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a wonderful decision by the ICC. Lubanga recruited Congolese children to become soldiers and ordered them to commit several atrocities and war crimes‚Ä¶ Lubanga was a killer. His militia killed the Congolese and raped women. I want him to be jailed for 25 years. Others will learn from it.‚Äù  But of course we also have to look at the larger picture, and there are some serious questions there. Koen Vlassenroot was one of the authors in the *Foreign Affairs* article I mentioned, and he wrote [a piece on the Lubanga verdict](http://africanarguments.org/2012/03/22/the-lubanga-verdict-a-milestone-in-the-fight-against-impunity-%E2%80%93-by-koen-vlassenroot/) which shares your view that conviction of single individuals doesn't achieve much.  &gt;Lubanga was an easy target. At the time he was transferred to The Hague, he was already politically neutralized and no longer posing any security threat. Things may be different with people such as Bosco Ntaganda, who holds one on the keys to stability in the east, and who is an essential element in Kabila‚Äôs strategy of control ‚Äì including maintaining a delicate balance with Kigali. So let‚Äôs be realistic and limit our ambitions. Sending Bosco to The Hague may do some good and would send a clear message that war crimes committed no longer go unpunished. But it will have limited impact on those dynamics and mechanisms that are defining current realities on the ground. There will be no lack of new Lubangas and Boscos as long as there is no serious effort at state building in the DRC.  So I will say what I said to my students the day after I first saw *Kony 2012* ‚Äî the arrest of Mr. K is an important step, but not nearly enough to change the dynamics of the region and prevent other kids from being conscripted. (Thus I also echoed [AI's call for an end to child soldiers](http://takeaction.amnestyusa.org/siteapps/advocacy/ActionItem.aspx?c=6oJCLQPAJiJUG&amp;b=6645049&amp;aid=517367) around the world.) Speaking of AI..  &gt;Amnesty International is great, but it's a very distant, privileged form of help.  I don't really know what to say here, other than I live a very distant, privileged form of life. Unless you expect me to sell all of my possessions and move to East Timor, I'm not sure what would be better. I'm also involved with a sister city alliance, and we've done work to help kids go to school, provide funds for medical assistance, etc.   In the end, however, I'm not too worried about whether you (or anyone else) approves of the methods of activism I've chosen to pursue. If my discussion here has focused mostly on white people, it's because they are the vast majority of the (dozen or so) people who read my blog. I have considered my audience and written accordingly. (Elsewhere, however, you will find plenty of discussions about [Assata Shakur](http://www.fbesp.org/synapse/?p=268), [Sally Zahran](http://www.fbesp.org/synapse/?p=99), [K'Naan](http://www.fbesp.org/synapse/?p=12), and others.)  Okay, so now that I've put myself so completely out there, may I ask you to do a bit of the same? Perhaps you can help me reorient myself to a less WMB style of activism? Please explain what sort of actions you take on a regular basis to make the world a better place. (Aside from commenting extensively on Reddit threads.) I'm not trying to be a jerk here ‚Äî I really want to know where you're coming from and what you have in mind for more enlightened activism.  Thanks for being in dialogue.",‚Ñ¢

t5_2fwo,aseipp,1333589525,"I don't think this is a very fair observation of academia. To be honest, pretty much no black and white analysis along those lines is. It's like saying either you're either an expert programmer or you're just a terrible one working with toys, and there is no middle ground. Programmers, like research, do not work this way. They are accumulations that result from many facets of the world we live in, over time. It also paints a bleak picture that isn't there; ignoring the crucial fact that small steps are needed to make a large journey. If the world was as simple as you make it out to be, it wouldn't be anywhere near as interesting.  I'd also disagree that many of the people working on languages like Haskell are solving toy problems. Or the people working on, say, theorem provers, which have made incredible strides in the past few decades - people would laugh at you 15 years ago if you told them we had formally verified compilers or OSs in a decade, but we do. Indeed, the GHC crew &amp; co in particular have tackled many interesting, pragmatic problems over the course of their work that I think deserves applause, including things other languages cannot grapple anywhere near as easily.  Transactional memory is an easy example as it's been a historic failure in pretty much every other language to date, but was relatively easily added to GHC. The type system has gotten increasingly more powerful, while remaining consistent and robust. GHC is perhaps the only compiler I know of that uses equality proofs as evidence in the core IR to achieve such goals - an approach based on work out of the theorem proving community among others. Much work has gone into making Haskell fast, and it is really surprisingly fast when you compare it to many other languages. The RTS contains an advanced parallel garbage collector, with modifications even allowing multiple threads to do minor GCs totally independently. Declarative and safe parallelism is another - with dozens of libraries with different designs to accommodate different problems, some achieving completely transparent and automatic parallelization - while remaining safe. Lightweight threads that effectively operate like real OS threads, scaling into the millions on commodity machines across cores is another (Erlang being the exception. I don't know how Go acts in the face of goroutines making e.g. blocking syscalls, but maybe they cover it too.) Achieving these goals are not easy, and there has been much thought put into making them fit together well. This aspect is just as much engineering as it is research (Simon Marlow in particular is quite the engineer IMO.) Practically speaking, many Haskellers use these features to write Real Software‚Ñ¢ every day, many doing commercial software, even.  None of this work however, would have been possible without the work of dozens of other researchers analyzing what you may consider ""toy problems"" and taking small steps. Go look at any research paper on GHC - the amount of citations and prior work is high, with careful analysis of competing designs. Not every design or idea works - many papers have not come to fruitation. But none of the above would have been possible without hard research, decades of accumulated ideas, and good old elbow grease.  TL;DR your analysis is woefully simplistic and short-sighted.",‚Ñ¢

t5_2sokd,Popular-Uprising-,1333593507,"I agree that as long as politicians can be unduly influences, the conflict of interests for a private prison outweigh any financial upside, but I couldn't disagree more for education or healthcare.   Education is a voluntary arrangement. Parents should be able to pick the schools that their children go to and the profit motive will force those schools to educate the children. It simply isn't working the way it is set up now. Illiteracy rates are climbing, test scores are falling, and graduation rates are very low. Why is it okay to force children to stay in a failing school. The conflict of interest here is in the government educating the future voters of the country.  Healthcare costs are spiraling out of control right now because of government influence and restrictions on the industry. It is also a conflict of interests for the government to decide who gets covered and to decide who gets what health treatment.   &gt;If we're going to subcontract prisons to private organisations, why not the police, why not courts and judges?   Why not? We already subcontract police (private security, etc.) and the areas they protect are safer than the areas that the police protect. They are also more responsive to their customers wishes and more susceptible to lawsuits. This tends to make them less likely to violate someone's civil rights. I'm not saying that we should do away with public police forces, but private ones certainly work and they are better in many ways than the brutality and corruption that many police forces in the US employ now.  We already have private courts (arbitration). It certainly works. As long as all parties agree to it, what harm is there in having them alongside public courts?   &gt;Why should I get the right to an attourney at public expense? Why not a attourney sponsored by Pepsi‚Ñ¢ if it saves the state money? Hope I don't get a Coca-Cola ‚Ñ¢ judge.

Well, I hung out with my cousin, sister-in-law and nephew this evening, that was nice. * Today was eventful in regards to finding a job. Received the email with the tests I've been waiting for for over a week. Completed 2/4, the other two wouldn't work on my computer, so I emailed technical support. Still waiting on a reply. I also received an email from another agency I'm registered with regarding a possible data entry position. I slept in, so by the time I emailed back they were closed, so I'll have to call in the morning to see if the position is still available. But even if it is, there's pretty much no way for me to work it out. First I'd need to bring ID to the agency, but I don't have ID. No SIN card, license, and an expired passport. Nor do I have a car (obviously), so I'd have to bus there with money I don't have. Then I'd have to bus to the job. =/ I suck. Need to get myself more prepared. * Took a break from French stuff today after yesterday's LEARN ALL THE THINGS French madness. * Going to ask my mom if she can bring me to get my license on Monday. Also if I could pay her back when I *finally* have a job... I don't see her agreeing, but we'll see. * The weather's been pretty crap all week. If I can get up while it's still sunny tomorrow, I'll go outside and just sit. Could use some fresh air. * Brushed my teeth once and flossed once. * No exercise today. Tomorrow, **definitely.** * I helped tidy up the house today, but not my room. * I'll be reading chapter one of The Shack before sleep. I read the foreword on the night of Day One. * Practiced ukulele for maybe 2 hours, spent another 2 hours finding tabs/chords of more songs to learn. * Yeah... It's 5:47AM... &gt;_&gt; * Anyone have any tips on how to boost self-esteem and confidence? Something I could do daily? I guess I'll look that up tomorrow. * I started writing something on the night of Day One... Haven't forgotten about it and I will not be giving up on it. I think if I complete it, it'll be a nice boost to my confidence in myself and my abilities, or might be a push to write more and not give up when I have ideas. * Did a bit... I could do better.

Many of these tweaks are included in nearly every free android rom, but cost anywhere from $1 to $15 for ios. iBlacklist, gridlock, mail enhancer, etc.   Though on the flip side of this argument, when a component of Android or one of its default apps is lacking, which is often, because many seem to be designed with a ""hey, it's just the default.

Only 10 have had the treatment for over 10 years. There has been basically no study in how effective the reversibility is.  There are also significant questions over the quality of studies.  Early trials were aborted due to significant safety concerns:  &gt; In October 2002, India's Ministry of Health aborted the clinical trials due to reports of **albumin in urine and scrotal swelling in Phase III trial participants.**[6] The Indian Council for Medical Research noted that dimethyl sulfoxide used as a solvent for the injection is known to cause kidney damage.[7]   And there are serious questions over lack of progress since then.  &gt; In March 2006, the ICMR announced that Phase III trials of RISUG could resume at 4 centers around India. The announcement of this progress led to renewed interest in RISUG. **Unfortunately, little progress has been made since March.** The research centers do not have enough of the RISUG compound to move forward with the trial. Marksans, the pharmaceutical company which has a manufacturing agreement with the inventor and the government, is now over a year past its initial **April 2005 product delivery estimate.** It is not clear why the delay continues.

This is configured at the organization level on a per-external organization basis, with one organization relationship in place with each external organization you want to share free/busy information with. This provides the other organization access to your Availability service at the level of detail specified. You can also restrict which internal users' free/busy data is accessible by specifying a security distribution group; only members of that group will have their free/busy data accessible via the organization relationship. Organization relationships are discussed in detail in the ""Organization Relationship"" section of this chapter.   The organization-level prerequisites to enabling two-way free/busy access between organizations are: Both organizations must be running Exchange Server 2010 Client Access servers. Both organizations must have federation trusts created and configured for the SMTP domains of the users who will be accessing free/busy between the organizations. The creation and management of federation trusts is discussed in detail in the ""Federated Trust"" section of this chapter.

t5_2qy7t,ropers,1333696367,"[Linux is a *Unix-like* OS, and a *functional Unix*.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix-like#Categories) It is a non-genetic relative of the same family of operating systems. (See [here](https://www.google.com/search?q=unix+family+tree&amp;tbm=isch) and [here](http://www.levenez.com/unix/).) It uses many of the same kinds of standard tools, but there are often several clones/versions/implementations of those standard tools available (with varying degrees of [POSIX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX)-compliance), one of which would typically be installed on your system. In Linux, the OS is not monolithic and not centrally managed. The choice of which implementations (even of standard tools and libraries) to cobble together the whole OS from is largely up to the distribution maintainer or the user. (For Unix-like OSes where all the standard tools and libraries are centrally managed and maintained, and where the OS is more unified as a whole, try [the BSDs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_BSD_operating_systems), which by the way are genetic Unixes.) Not all implementations of the [passwd](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passwd_%28command%29) tool say ""UNIX password"", but I guess it makes sense to say this for clarity, because it can help terminal users (especially terminal users juggling many terminal sessions with different command lines) to clarify that they're now about to change the OS user password of a Unix-like OS (and not, e.g., a database password or some other kind of password). In your case, if you didn't do it yourself, then it was probably the maintainer of your Linux distribution who chose a passwd implementation that says ""Unix"" as part of its output. Mind you, most Unix-like OSes are broadly compatible and try to more or less follow similar standards (such as POSIX), and this means that you can often install tools from a (genetic) Unix OS on a work-alike OS (a functional Unix) such as Linux and vice versa. There's not really a sharp distinction between what's Unix software and what's Linux software, and this mutual compatibility is a good thing. It is however typically required that you recompile from source code, because all the various flavours of Unix and Linux are not binary-compatible. If you don't like your passwd tool's output to say ""Unix"", you could always install an implementation of `passwd` that doesn't say Unix, or you could even change e.g. the source code of your passwd tool and recompile.   PS:   Some reasons why you might not like a standard tool in your Unix-like OS to say ""Unix"" are:   * Even though ""Unix"" has long since become a [genericized trademark](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genericized_trademark), there are still various companies and trademark trolls out there who will try to claim the term ""Unix"" as their own proprietary trademark, and some folks fear being bothered by those trolls over the mere mention of a genericized trademark. Others don't want to make things any easier for trademark trolls and are confident that an actual lawsuit would result in legal confirmation of the loss of proprietary rights to the Unix‚Ñ¢ trademark, due to the long-standing and widespread genericization of the term.  * There's been a long (and partially Microsoft-financed) lawsuit by some ""Intellectual Property"" trolls called SCO who unsuccessfully tried to claim in court that Linux was not just a functional Unix but also a genetic Unix, i.e. they claimed that Linux had copied proprietary Unix code that they claimed to own. They were wrong on both counts, but because this was such a dirty campaign to hurt Linux, some Linux users might be especially averse to installing any implementation of a standard tool that says ""Unix"", if only because of the bad memories.",‚Ñ¢

Much thanks to IPL for organizing a tournament in such a luxury hotel. After taking a power nap (the travel was very taxing). After the nap, we (myself, partners from Playhem and my friend Slava) went to a buffet (Whicked Spoon) which was 35USD per person with a lot of different delicious food. Especially appetizing was the lobster which was already cut up and you did not need to spend the effort to get the meat out. After that we went to a bar where we ordered a drink called ‚ÄúMoscow Mule‚Äù (the cocktail appeared a bit spicy for my taste) with Justin and his friend.   &gt; Then we went to buy some beer. We had to cross a bridge from the Cosmopolitan into Walgreen‚Äôs. Along the way we saw some interesting situations occur. There were homeless people on this bridge. One of the homeless people clearly had too much to drink and threw up on the bridge. Another person was threatening to ‚Äúcut you up‚Äù (he also had too much to drink) and a female was responding to him ‚Äúcome on, nigga,‚Äù but security was near and was doing their part on keeping the peace. The store also refused to sell us a bottle of Jameson because I did not have my passport with me (but my friend did and are of legal age). The cashiers refused to budge (so we wound up without Jameson). This doesn‚Äôt really work well if only one person with an ID walks in and buys alcohol for minors.

I dunno how your mate broke his cable - although I haven't been reading any reports of cables breaking (none posted in the subreddit as I can recall), the cable seems really robust to me. The guitar cable part of it, and the guitar jack itself, is *really* thick and solid, and better than regular guitar cables I've paid ¬£10 ($16) for. Likewise the USB end isn't much flimsier, and it's *at least* as thick as any other USB cable I have here in the house, perhaps thicker than any other (and I'm a computer geek for a living - I've bought USB cables by the dozen before now). The only part of the cable I've dubious about is that it's got this [proprietary ""quick release"" connector near the USB end](http://i.imgur.com/touZr.jpg), which is keyed; I don't really like it that much, and I guess it might be possible to jam in in wrongly and break it if you were rough with it.

It could be any number of things. It could be a statute requiring every household to tear down and rebuild its dwelling each year, or repeatedly dig a hole and refill it, but either of those would be a little bit too direct. It could be easy credit that creates a contagion of unnecessary home construction. Futile dirt-movement, drugs, home demolitions, excess construction from easy credit, etc. are just possible ways to provide the same incineration function.

The LEDPB10W-40E LED boat light from Magnalight produces 3,440 lumens of bright light while drawing only 40 watts @3.35 amps from a 12 volt electrical system. Four CREE XLamp MC-E¬Æ ten watt LEDs producing 860 lumens each are paired with high purity optics to produce a 20 degree spread spot beam approximately 450' long by 75' in width. We also offer floodlight versions with a 40 degree beam spread to provide more light over a larger area nearer the fixture, making flood versions ideal for use as spreader and area lights. These LED light bars are waterproof to 3 meters, sealed against intrusion by dust and dirt and very ruggedly constructed to withstand the demanding conditions found in marine environments.  An integral Pulse Width Modulation controller, high output, low power requirements, high durability and versatile mounting options makes these LED light emitters a superior lighting solution for boats and marine applications where versatility, extreme durability and efficiency is needed.  Heat Management: Heat is the single largest factor in premature LED failure and color shifting. These LED units contain advanced drivers which use pulse width modulation to control heat buildup rather than simple voltage regulators which are typically harsh on sensitive electronics and can contribute to early LED failure. These units automatically sense the temperature of each LED and adjust the energy frequency or ""duty cycle"" accordingly to maintain heat levels within acceptable ranges. This system in essence flashes current at an extremely fast on and off rate to each LED based upon the LED's core temperature. This flash rate is too fast to detect with the human eye, but provides precise control of the current flowing to each LED and thus the heat it generates. This allows the LEDs to be driven at up to 100% capacity without overheating or visible loss of light output. The LEDs are always driven at the same voltage but the duty cycle, however, is changed to alter how long the LEDs are actually on or off. The end result is more light with less heat and longer LED life with an average 70% lumen maintenance after 50,000 hours.  PWM Control: The PWM drivers in these units provide boaters with an extremely versatile lighting option. The pulse width modulation drivers provide the ability to tap into a provided input wire with an external pulse generator and adjust the duty cycle of the current being applied to the LEDs. Thus, you can connect an external dimmer, switch or pulse control and adjust the perceived output of the light, effectively causing the light to flash, dim or brighten to the desired levels. This ability makes these LED fixtures capable of acting as beacons and signal lights as well as all around lighting fixtures.  Additionally, this method of controlling light output results in a corresponding drop in amperage draw, so if the duty cycle is cut back to 50% there will be a matching 50% reduction in amperage draw. These units are also able to monitor and adjust input current to maintain the correct LED voltage levels regardless of input levels across a specific range. These LEDP10W series light bars can operate on current ranging from 9 to 46VDC without any modifications necessary as a result. This ability to sense and adjust input current also provides protection against voltage spikes and drops that can occur in a watecraft's electrical systems which would otherwise result in burning up or premature LED failure without it.

I agree 100% that people drink the kool-aid and totally went balls deep into barefoot/min running and that most of them when talking about forefoot vs heel striking don't know what they're talking about.  Even on this thread we see it.  But the fact of the matter is, you are absolutely correct in that people (and as the defendant claim's, Vibram) did not follow the advice of the exercise science community.  But again, that's the whole point...the science **doesn't know**    Here's the American Podiatric Medical Association's statement on Barefoot running -  &gt;Barefoot running is a possible alternative or training adjunct to running with shoes. While anecdotal evidence and testimonials proliferate on the Internet and in the media about the possible health benefits of barefoot running, research has not yet adequately shed light on the immediate and long term effects of this practice.  So, when Vibram says ""you get all the health benefits of barefoot running combined with our patented Vibram¬Æ sole that protects you from elements and obstacles in your path.‚Äù  One could infer that there are actually (proven) health benefits to running barefoot.  From Vibram's site -  &gt;The benefits of running barefoot have **long been supported by scientific research**. And there is ample evidence that training without shoes allows you to run faster and farther with fewer injuries. (bolding mine)   That's really the heart of the matter right there because **there is not that scientific evidence**.  Vibrams can try and cover their ass all they want by giving you a plan and telling to start slow and that it might take a year for the adjustment to occur but that's not the point, the point is that, according to Vibram, once you've adapted you'll miraculously have all these ""health benefits"".  /r/triathlon can circlejerk all they want about heel vs forefoot striking but just like Vibram, they can't prove anything, the science just isn't there.

Freedman, PhD,corresponding author Uta Landy, PhD, and Jody Steinauer, MD, MAS The authors are with the Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences and the Bixby Center for Reproductive Health Global, University of California, San Francisco.  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2636458  &gt;**Nontreatment, Delays, and Transport of Patients** &gt;Obstetrician‚Äìgynecologists working in Catholic-owned hospitals described cases in which abortion was medically indicated according to their medical judgment but, because of the ethics committee's ruling, it was delayed until either fetal heartbeats ceased or the patient could be transported to another facility. Dr P, from a midwestern, mid-sized city, said that at her Catholic-owned hospital, approval for termination of pregnancy was rare if a fetal heartbeat was present (even in ‚Äúpeople who are bleeding, they're all the way dilated, and they're only 17 weeks‚Äù) unless ‚Äúit looks like she's going to die if we don't do it.‚Äù In another case, Dr H, from the same Catholic-owned hospital in the Midwest, sent her patient by ambulance 90 miles to the nearest institution where the patient could have an abortion because the ethics committee refused to approve her case.  &gt;&gt;    She was very early, 14 weeks. She came in ‚Ä¶ and there was a hand sticking out of the cervix. Clearly the membranes had ruptured and she was trying to deliver‚Ä¶ . There was a heart rate, and [we called] the ethics committee, and they [said], ‚ÄúNope, can't do anything.‚Äù So we had to send her to [the university hospital]‚Ä¶ . You know, these things don't happen that often, but from what I understand it, it's pretty clear. Even if mom is very sick, you know, potentially life threatening, can't do anything.  &gt;In residency, Dr P and Dr H had been taught to perform uterine evacuation or labor induction on patients during inevitable miscarriage whether fetal heart tones were present or not. In their new Catholic-owned hospital environment, such treatment was considered a prohibited abortion by the governing ethics committee because the fetus is still alive and the patient is not yet experiencing ‚Äúa life-threatening pathology‚Äù such as sepsis. Physicians such as Dr H found that in some cases, transporting the patient to another hospital for dilation and curettage (D&amp;C) was quicker and safer than waiting for the fetal heartbeat to stop while trying to stave off infection and excessive blood loss. Dr B, an obstetrician‚Äìgynecologist working in an academic medical center, described how a Catholic-owned hospital in her western urban area asked her to accept a patient who was already septic. When she received the request, she recommended that the physician from the Catholic-owned hospital perform a uterine aspiration there and not further risk the health of the woman by delaying her care with the transport.  &gt;&gt;    Because the fetus was still alive, they wouldn't intervene. And she was hemorrhaging, and they called me and wanted to transport her, and I said, ‚ÄúIt sounds like she's unstable, and it sounds like you need to take care of her there.‚Äù And I was on a recorded line, I reported them as an EMTALA [Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act] violation. And the physician [said], ‚ÄúThis isn't something that we can take care of.‚Äù And I [said], ‚ÄúWell, if I don't accept her, what are you going to do with her?‚Äù [He answered], ‚ÄúWe'll put her on a floor [i.e., admit her to a bed in the hospital instead of keeping her in the emergency room]; we'll transfuse her as much as we can, and we'll just wait till the fetus dies.‚Äù  &gt;Ultimately, Dr B chose to accept the patient to spare her unnecessary suffering and harm, but she saw this case as a form of ‚Äúpatient dumping,‚Äù because the patient was denied treatment and transported while unstable.",¬©

t5_2s3bw,Joseph_P_Brenner,1333858012,"Summary of why the large egg size?  EDIT: &gt;Although giant water bugs (Hemiptera: Belostomatidae) are large, aquatic insects known for their obligate paternal egg brooding behaviors, little research has focused on the structure of their eggs. The respiratory requirements of developing embryos likely created selection for brooding, so a thorough understanding of the respiratory morphology of belostomatid eggs could help explain how brooding behaviors facilitate embryonic gas exchange. This study used scanning electron microscopy to document the respiratory microstructure of the eggs of Abedus herberti, a back brooding giant water bug. The exochorion is similar to that of other belostomatids in texture and organization except that the respiratory region is confined to the uppermost quarter of the egg. This is the area exposed to the atmosphere by encumbered males. A plastron network made up of densely packed vertical projections demarcates the boundary between the respiratory and nonrespiratory regions of the chorion. The internal chorion is composed of alternate air-filled and denser layers that likely facilitate the movement of oxygen from the aeropyles at the top of the eggs to the developing embryonic tissues.

t5_2cneq,laofmoonster,1333917058,"The church itself may be conservative on social issues, but Catholic Americans as a whole are moderate on [abortion](http://www.gallup.com/poll/117154/catholics-similar-mainstream-abortion-stem-cells.aspx), and slightly liberal on [LGBT issues](http://www.religiondispatches.org/dispatches/candacechellew-hodge/4417/new_poll_shows_strong_catholic_support_for_gay_rights).

Discussions of Catholicism on Reddit often devolve into two topics:  1. Pedophile comments  2. ""Catholics aren't as crazy as Reddit thinks. I went to a Catholic school and we kept science and religion as separate topics. I learned evolution in biology class and theology on Sundays"".  \#1 is general redditry, but #2 is worth noting. My Completely Unverified Theory‚Ñ¢ is that since Catholics in the US tend to be moderates living in liberal areas in the north, and since Catholic doctrine is centralized (and thus more visible), Reddit characterizes Catholics as more conservative than they actually are. Reddit also forgets that people can identify as Catholic while not agreeing with the church on everything. A religion is more than the sum of its beliefs, so even the 40% of Catholics who are pro-choice should still be taken at their word that they are really Catholics.",‚Ñ¢

t5_2qnmr,jeannaimard,1333938628,"Pour commencer, si tu veux √™tre pris au s√©rieux, c‚Äôest pas mal important de parler fran√ßais.  Mais, tout d‚Äôabord, un peu d‚Äôhistoire politique‚Ä¶  La ville de Montr√©al a √©t√© incorpor√©e en 1833; le premier maire √©tait Jacques Viger.  Montr√©al a √©t√© gouvern√©e comme ville d‚Äôaffaires; c‚Äôest √† dire que les sp√©culateurs fonciers, les commer√ßants et les propri√©taires locateurs ont √©t√© grandement favoris√©s par la ville, qui permettait un type de construction √† haute densit√© qui n‚Äô√©tait pas tol√©r√© dans les villes de banlieue o√π habitaient g√©n√©ralement ces hommes d‚Äôaffaires.  Jusque dans les ann√©es 60, le conseil municipal √©tait loin d‚Äô√™tre d√©mocratique; il y avait trois classes de conseillers municipaux: ceux √©lus par le petit peuple habitant Montr√©al; ceux √©lus par les propri√©taires (qui ne devaient pas n√©c√©ssairement habiter √† Montr√©al pour y voter) et ceux √©lus par des organisations sociales (chambre de commerce, syndicats, clerg√©, associations professionnelles, etc.). Bref, c‚Äô√©tait en fait un gouvernement fasciste (dans le sens mussolinien).  De plus, les partis politiques n‚Äôont d‚Äôimportance √† Montr√©al que depuis les 50 derni√®res ann√©es; la charte de la ville est con√ßue pour faire fonctionner la ville par des conseillers municipaux ind√©pendants (Pierre Bourque s‚Äôy est d‚Äôailleurs cass√© les dents, car un de ses conseillers qui si√©geait au comit√© ex√©cutif, ayant d√©cid√© de quitter son parti, a pu conserver son si√®ge, car la charte de la ville ne reconna√Æt pas l‚Äôexistence de partis politiques ‚Äî c‚Äôest d‚Äôailleurs pour √ßa que G√©rald Tremblay y a nomm√© quelques conseillers de l‚Äôopposition).  Donc, les partis politiques sont une apparition r√©cente‚Ä¶ Jusque dans les ann√©es 60, les conseilliers √©taient g√©n√©ralement corrompus, car le plus souvent financ√©s par la p√®gre, qui permettait √† celle-ci de prosp√©rer de toutes sortes de commerces illicites (prostitution, jeu, boisson, etc.).  Puis au d√©but des ann√©es 50, deux avocats ont d√©cid√© de nettoyer le tout: Jean Drapeau et Pacifique Plante. Ils ont cr√©√© la ligue d‚Äôaction civique et Drapeau a √©t√© √©lu en 1954. S‚Äôensuivit un nettoyage de la ville qui a grandement entach√© sa r√©putation de ville agr√©able. On rasa m√™me le sommet du Mont-Royal pour mettre un frein aux √©bats sexuels qui s‚Äôy d√©roulaient; pour cel√†, on il fut longtemps surnomm√© ¬´le mont chauve¬ª, et il a fallu pr√®s de 40 ans pour s‚Äôen remettre‚Ä¶  Bri√®vement √©cart√© du pouvoir entre 1957 et 1960 par Sarto Fournier (qui, soit dit en passant, a pouss√© la candidature de Montr√©al aupr√®s du Bureau International des Expositions ‚Äî non, ce n‚Äôest pas Jean Drapeau qui est responsable de la venue de l‚ÄôExpo 67!!!), Drapeau revient en force en 1960 o√π il r√®gnera sans partage, d‚Äôune main de fer, gr√¢ce √† son conseil municipal-marionnette, jusqu‚Äôen 1984. C‚Äôest √† ce moment que Montr√©al fut saccag√©e pour construire des autoroutes et des stationnements; 50 ans plus tard, le centre-ville a toujours l‚Äôair d‚Äôune zone d√©vast√©e. Jean Drapeau a pratiquement tu√© la ville avec sa politique pro-automobile. Le transport en commun a √©t√© grandement n√©glig√© durant ces ann√©es l√†, malgr√© l‚Äôouverture du m√©tro.  Au d√©but des ann√©es 70, le r√®gne de Drapeau suscitant de nombreux m√©contentements, le Rassemblement des Citoyens de Montr√©al (RCM) est form√©, et parvient √† faire √©lire des conseillers en 1974, ce qui fait dire au maire d‚Äôalors, Jean Drapeau, que c‚Äôen √©tait fini de la d√©mocratie √† l‚Äôh√¥tel de ville!!!  Finalement, le RCM est port√© au pouvoir en 1986, ce qui a permis de d√©faire la plupart des politiques les plus n√©fastes de l‚Äô√®re Drapeau, et d‚Äôinstaurer une √®re o√π les citoyens seront consult√©s. Mais en 1994, le jardiner en chef de la ville, Pierre Bourque (G√©ranium Pommier, pour les dames) a √©t√© √©lu, et s‚Äôest empress√© de saccager le transport en commun et les m√©canismes de consultation populaires, d√©faisant ainsi le travail du RCM.  Entretemps, le RCM est devenu l‚Äôactuelle ¬´Union Montr√©al¬ª, qui a pris le pouvoir en 2001, instaurant ainsi l‚Äô√®re actuel de corruption inh√©rent √† tout lib√©ral (G√©rald Tremblay est un lib√©ral notoire), ainsi que celles des poign√©es de main en Jell-O‚Ñ¢.  Une fois Pierre Bourque √©vinc√©, Louise Harel a repris sa formation politique et en a d√©barrass√© tous les cr√©tins incomp√©tents qui y pullulaient pour y installer des personnes comp√©tentes, et ils ont rafl√© plusieurs mairies d‚Äôarrondissement lors des derni√®res √©lections, de m√™me que l‚Äôautre parti d‚Äôopposition, Projet Montr√©al, dirig√© par l‚Äôurbaniste Richard Bergeron qui refusa de s‚Äôallier √† Louise Harel, voulant √™tre maire lui-m√™me‚Ä¶",‚Ñ¢

Goodbye t.  ok, we've gotten rid of the three most common letters.  the fourth most common letter is the o.  if you got this far you are doing really well!  only two more, and half of all the letters will be hidden!  that's because the six most common letters occur half the time.  letters i and n are next. that wasn't too bad, right?  here are a great couple lines from steve jobs:  ""life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact; that everything around you that you call life was made up by people no smarter than you.  the minute you understand that, you can poke life; you can change it, you can mold it, embrace it, make your mark upon it.""  let's remove some of the mouseover hints, before adding letters.  you probably know a, e, and o pretty well, so no more hints for them.  also, i is pretty easy and looks like an i, so no hints for i now.  you are doing very well if you've gotten this far.  let's do no more t hints. t is everywhere.  if we do no n hints, we can move onto more letters.  this could be a good time to go to memorize.com/dotsies.  or, if you're enjoying just reading this way, that's good also.  s is the next letter. it is an easy one.  it is a sassy shape. see how it sits in the middle.  letter h is after s on the frequency list.  h is harder than s but is higher than i.  did I mention you are doing fantastically well?  only two more, and about three fourths will be dotsies!  r kind of looks like an r, with the hole at the top.  you rarely regret reading an r, or whatever.  d is a dot above the e, of course.  some dudes do good deeds, but deny doing them.  excellent, that takes care of three fourths of letters.  after the next group we'll be at about ninety percent!  now do the first two tables on memorize.com/dotsies.  do the sixth and seventh tables too, since they correspond.  that should help you be comfortable with the first ten letters.  now we can start turning some hints off.  let's remove s because it's so simple.  now so long to h hints for now.  only two more left, and we're at seventy five percent.  r has the hole at the top, so let's remove it.  and d is the single dot, so let's delete its hints.  wow, now three fourths of the letters are dotsies.  that is fantastic! be sure to tell us on twitter.  it is down hill from here.  do the third table on memorize.com/dotsies.  that way we can add the next five all at once.  they are l, c, u, m and w.  ok, so how is this? you're now up to ninety percent!  the last eleven letters are used surprisingly rarely.  the last six are only used two percent of the time.  some have argued they should be removed from the alphabet.  let's see where we are now: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz.  not bad! you are doing splendidly if you're reading this!  reach around to your back and give yourself a good pat.  or maybe even a quick massage.  ok, stop massaging yourself. hints off!  we'll do the next two tables quickly.  once you know most of the letters you can often guess the rest.  now go to memorize.com/dotsies and do the fourth table.  the letters are f, g, y, p and b.  they're off now, but it doesn't look much different, eh?  it's truly down hill now. only one more group after this.  i'm going to turn the hints off in a moment.  are you ready? the letters in that group were so rare anyway.  ok, the hints are off again.  now, onto the very last group!  go to memorize.com/dotsies. and do the last table.  letters v, k, j, x, q and z are now dotsified!  that means every single letter is dotsified and you're a friggin expert :).  if you didn't notice, check out the ""combine"" link on memorize.com.  you can use it to do all the tables at once.  ok, hints are now off for the last group!  this is the full dotsies font without the hints!  you may notice that it's no longer stretched out as well.  the dots are very close to squares.  and here it is a bit smaller. congrats - well done! this makes you one of a pretty select group. chat with us on twitter!

t5_2qhnf,snbrgr,1333986448,"&gt;Whole western culture and logic is based upon that.  Regarding culture, this a controverse and vague statement, which certainly has a point, but also oversimplifies and disregards the role of for example the Enlightenment or the term ""western culture"" itself. Regarding logic, I would just ask you to demonstrate in which way for example the statement ""p &amp; q ‚Üî r"" is in any way abrahamic.   &gt;(after the demise of greek civilization, greek philosophers rational world gave way to christianity's God's world).  Again, this is a strong oversimplification and in some points simply wrong. Many medieval Christian thinkers had ancient Greek role models, the most famous one being Thomas Aquinas and Aristotle. The whole culture of Scholasticism is based on the harmonisation of ""rational"" (one could argue about that) ancient philosophies such as Aristotle's or Platon's and Christian theology on the other hand; if science was based on Scholasticism, then you would have a point in your claims of an amalgation of religion and science - but this is not the case. Your line from culture to education to science disregards the last 500 years of secularisation in the west.   &gt;That's why we don't easily see that ""there is no rebirth, mind is not the sixth sense, no life after death"" etc are infact basic hypothesis in western science. We don't even question them.  We question them, just as Stevenson did. But collecting anecdotes from children may not live up to the standards of the scientific method. You're right when you say, that there are some basic hypotheses in science (there's a lot of dispute going on about those in the philosophy of science), but those are not based on religion or are religious of nature: unlike dogmata, they can be proven wrong and dismissed.   So, if you want to make the mind the sixth sense, prove the existence of an afterlife or rebirth, I would suggest you to deliver some verifiable and falsifiable arguments. The subjectivism which is reminiscent in terms like ""developed minds"", ""great level (of mind)"" or ""improvement of mind"" may not serve that purpose so well. ",‚Üî

To allow optimal system operation and long-term reliability, the processor must not exceed the maximum case temperature specifications as defined by the **applicable thermal profile**.  TCASE is the temperature measurement using a thermocouple embedded in the center of the heat spreader. This initial measurement is done at the factory. Post-manufacturing, TCASE is is calibrated by the BIOS, through a reading delivered by a diode between and below the cores. (The temp you reference is the temp measured during production of 66.8C. The reading delivered by the diode, post production is listed as 72.8C)  Tjunction is synonymous with core temperatures, and calculated based on the output from the Digital Thermal Sensor (DTS) using the formula Tjunction = (Tjunction Max ‚Äì DTS output).    From what I've read, ideally the core temps should be 15-20C below Tj Max (91C according to Real Temp).   Edit: The paragraph is cut and paste from intel site.

t5_2qpp6,LRed,1334029438,"No problem at all I was just providing my personal experience and maybe I was just an isolated incident IDK but sure I'm always happy to help :) There were 2 instances where this happened to me first was a headset I bought after I broke my last razer headset for sitting on it(woops) it was a TTe-sports spin headset or something (it was a while ago) and what happened was that after spending some time gaming at a friends house and coming home I was beat and just lightly threw the headset on top of my bed now I think it might of hit in a bad angle but  the small part connecting the actual speaker to the frame broke and the speaker was left just hanging by a thread(literally) and that was the end of that. I guess maybe it hit in an odd angle and all the weight pressed down on it and the small plastic bit connecting which was around the size of the 3.5mm jack broke now I'd only had the headset for around 4 months and had never fallen or anything like that and considering how sturdy my past headsets had been this struck me as (no offense) crap material or design and after looking online I saw some ppl also found that the quality was lacking.Now I know you've released the HD one and maybe you fixed it but that experience left me with a bad taste. Second might not really be so much on you as it is on how rough I am on with my mice but basically one day it stopped working possibly due to falling so much when I go to my friends and try to untangle cables but I'd had my previous mouse which was razer last over 2 years where as this last 6 1/2 months maybe.Now these might of been isolated incident's but this is what happened to me and I take my knowledge from my experiences but maybe these were freak accidents idk but I hope this was of help besides I really love how you support e-sports , white-ra and the color red :p tl;dr bought 2 pretty pricey items from you.at most lasted 6 months. might of been just bad luck don't listen to only one person and make your own well thought out decisions. again hope I was of help I still love you Thermaltake ‚ô•",‚ô•

It's popularity is the only reason you think it's disrespectful. We consistently mock Norse, Greek, Roman and other mythologies and you have no problem with it. Why? Because they're not popular now.  My respect is earned, not given. I respect and admire many Christians. (It would be hard for me not to, considering there are so many of you.) I don't lump them in with douchebags unless they show themselves to be douchebags.  Finally: You aren't forced to be a Christian. You chose to be associated, at least by name, with people whom you would find distasteful.

I had my birthday in January, and he had started looking for the ideal gift around Christmas. He had something in his mind that *""I don't have yet, don't know I want yet, but that I will totally love""*. He had the worst of luck finding it: first he couldn't find one for sale because there aren't many of them around, because they never produced a new batch of them and because most collectors want to keep it. Then he found one for sale on Ebay, but was overbid in the last couple of seconds. Search started again, and then he found one, bought it, and had to wait a while for it to be shipped from America to Belgium.   He dropped a few hints:  - You want it, but you don't know you want it (yet).  - You probably don't even know it exists.  - It's brown.  - It has twelve things in it, ten that are similar and two that are different.  - It can, in a way, produce sound - but don't be misguided, if you smash a vase, it produces sound as well.  I was curious, he kept teasing me with it. I have been looking forward to last Saturday for a while and couldn't believe my eyes when I saw it. Apart from some ""extras"" he found (a couple of books with pictures and lyrics), he got me [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Solo_Collection): **Freddie Mercury's entire collection of solo work, combined with two DVDs and other unproduced soundbits and pre-final versions of songs, bundled in a big book with photos and a biography.**   I am really really happy, and since I teased you by letting you know I was getting a gift, I thought I might as well let you know what it was.  ###I am the happiest girl in the world.  Not because of the Freddie Mercury book/collection, but because of the man who gave it to me. ‚ô•",‚ô•

Time flew by and it was Sunday morning, just enough daylight to start exploring the caves. Jr decided to go ahead of us and barefoot, with no flashlight, he managed to get through the pitch black cave until we reached him at the point within the cave of climbing a rope up about 10-15 feet above us to get to a vertical shaft we would have to free climb with help from a rope from up top the mountain. Needless to say I couldn't do it, and my best friend and I walked back to camp through the cave, the same way we came in. By then the boys had already climbed to the top of the mountain, and came down the side of it. Jr was still up above us when we came back through the caves entrance.   Around noon, on Sunday, we began calling out to him to come down the same side the boys had come down earlier, but he insisted on resting his feet. 20mins go by and we begin calling to him again only to get no response. Wondering where he went, Michelle and I walked around to the back side of the mountain where there is a canyon ravine type of land behind it, and we began calling out his name in a panic. Went back to camp and told the boys to go back into the cave to check if he had gone back in because it was hot outside on his bare feet. 45 minutes later the boys reached the top and call down to us that he wasn't in fact in that cave at all, and began to track his movements via footprints atop the mountain (covered in holes, leading down narrow to man-sized shafts, straight into caves) with only enough information to know that he wandered above the mountain but there were no tracks leading down any side.   After searching for almost two hours we immediately drove out of the desert leaving the water tent and a note telling jr we went to get water and food, and we drove as fast as the terrain allowed to the border patrol checkpoint on the highway to inform them of a missing person in our group. Since Sunday afternoon, without water, food, protection, flashlight, sweatshirt, or shoes, junior has been missing. Sheriffs, rangers, border patrol, helicopters, volunteer search and rescue teams, and search dogs have all been searching for him since. These mud caves are extremely unstable and can collapse with pressure, or with rainfall they fill up. Tomorrow is estimated that it should be raining and this terrifies us because we don't know where he could be, and rain would make things 100 times harder to search for him. We are all praying for his safe return and I ask that you please take the time out to pray for him and his family, and if anyone is willing to join the search party please contact me at (PM me for details).

Needless to say I couldn't do it, and my best friend and I walked back to camp through the cave, the same way we came in. By then the boys had already climbed to the top of the mountain, and came down the side of it. Jr was still up above us when we came back through the caves entrance.  Around noon, on Sunday, we began calling out to him to come down the same side the boys had come down earlier, but he insisted on resting his feet. 20mins go by and we begin calling to him again only to get no response. Wondering where he went, Michelle and I walked around to the back side of the mountain where there is a canyon ravine type of land behind it, and we began calling out his name in a panic. Went back to camp and told the boys to go back into the cave to check if he had gone back in because it was hot outside on his bare feet. 45 minutes later the boys reached the top and call down to us that he wasn't in fact in that cave at all, and began to track his movements via footprints atop the mountain (covered in holes, leading down narrow to man-sized shafts, straight into caves) with only enough information to know that he wandered above the mountain but there were no tracks leading down any side.  After searching for almost two hours we immediately drove out of the desert leaving the water tent and a note telling jr we went to get water and food, and we drove as fast as the terrain allowed to the border patrol checkpoint on the highway to inform them of a missing person in our group. Since Sunday afternoon, without water, food, protection, flashlight, sweatshirt, or shoes, junior has been missing. Sheriffs, rangers, border patrol, helicopters, volunteer search and rescue teams, and search dogs have all been searching for him since. These mud caves are extremely unstable and can collapse with pressure, or with rainfall they fill up. Tomorrow is estimated that it should be raining and this terrifies us because we don't know where he could be, and rain would make things 100 times harder to search for him. We are all praying for his safe return and I ask that you please take the time out to pray for him and his family, and if anyone is willing to join the search party please contact me at (PM me for details).

t5_2qh0u,r4willia,1334081061,"Guillermo Pino, UCSD Alumni, went missing on Sunday while exploring mud caves in Anza Borrego State Park. If anyone knows/is an EXPERIENCED climber or will be visiting Anza-Borrego within the next day or so, please keep a look-out. I must stress that you not venture into the mud caves alone, as they are unstable and can collapse without warning. I was not close friends with Guillermo, but whenever I did meet with him he was quiet and kind. He obviously made an impression on me, because I am doing my best to get the word out for him wherever I can. There is a search and rescue operation currently in progress. Below is the text from his family:  This past Saturday, a group of us including my bf, best friend and her husband along with her brother, Junior, went camping in the Anza Borrego desert mudcaves. Time flew by and it was Sunday morning, just enough daylight to start exploring the caves.

t5_2cneq,wikidd,1334085347,"It's not about hate though; lets ignore the large chunk of people who still engage in hateful bigotry (which happens even here on Reddit). It's about how the legacy of discrimination pervades our culture and discourse, and so cheapens and demeans us all.   I went to a bit of effort to find [this video](http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/the-big-picture/5465-Relics) in my browsing history, so please watch it. It's about racism, but I think the same logic can be extended to other prejudices. Failing to engage critically with ones own behaviour causes one to perpetuate the discrimination. It's not enough to think to yourself ""well gee, women should be free to leave the house and we shouldn't lynch black people, I guess now I'm all liberal!"". As well as changing your ideas, you also have to change your behaviour.  The really annoying thing is that it's not hard to not be a bigoted shitposter, it just requires a bit of empathy and decency. When someone says that they find something offensive and/or discriminatory, don't get defensive and go ""ah! logic proves you wrong!"" or ""well, if I were in your place"". Empathy is about imagining what it's like to be *someone else*. Don't put yourself in their shoes, try to be *them* in their shoes. It's like [bad kerning](http://xkcd.com/1015/): most people don't know about it but it's not hard to understand. When you do though, seeing it done wrong is *really* annoying.  Which brings us back to SRS. SRS does engage in lots of bigoted anti-white male cis straight etc humour. If it's wrong, it's only as wrong as the rest of Reddit. If straight white men were an oppressed minority then Reddit as a whole would be like SRS (without the funky CSS I guess) and SRS would be like Reddit is now.  But hey, at least it's contained within the circlejerk. There's no downvoting, no shitposting invasions or anything that causes a problem for the rest of Reddit. Despite that, it's highly controversial - it seems Reddit taken as a whole doesn't like being made fun of!  tl;dr discrimination is subtle and complicated.

t5_2qm4e,Cebus_capucinus,1334100124,"I am going to simplify things for you - but in general the Earth's biogeochemical systems are in balance. Meaning the natural cycles of GHG's - [nitrogen cycle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_cycle), [CO2 cycle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_cycle), water cycle, oxygen cycle... are balanced between what is stored (either as plant material, underground, or in water) and what is in the atmosphere (effecting Earth's temperature). Since these natural sources of GHG's are in balance over short time scales (geologically speaking) the Earth's temperature does not fluctuate very much. Over large time scales (hundred of thousands to millions of years) the Earth's temperature does change naturally, but very very slowly. For example: ""The global carbon budget is the balance of the exchanges (incomes and losses) of carbon between the carbon reservoirs or between one specific loop (e.g., atmosphere ‚Üî biosphere) of the carbon cycle"". This means what is naturally put back into the atmosphere (as proposed by your friend) is naturally reabsorbed by the biosphere - the carbon cycle is in balance - and there is little to no global temperature fluctuation.  Now you add humans to the equation - we are taking stored sources of GHG's (oil, natural gas, coal), burning them and shoving the resulting GHG's into the atmosphere at faster rates then the Earth can naturally reabsorb them. We are contributing more to the 'income' side of the equation and not balancing it with the 'losses' side - and the Earth cannot make up the difference fast enough. It is also important to note that what we are burning is the result of millions and millions of years of stored carbon and we are releasing back into the atmosphere in the span of a 150 years. The Earth's cycling systems cannot keep up - so the atmosphere gets clogged with GHG's resulting in global warming.  Basically we are the problem, this is the scientific consensus. Humans are causing the current observed global warming, not nature.  TL;DR: Your friend is wrong - irregardless if the mariana trench (and by that I assume they mean undersea thermal vents) is a source for greenhouse gases these are natural derived sources offset by re-absorbtion mechanisms that also occur naturally in '[biogeochemical cycles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biogeochemical_cycles)'.

First of all, Macs aren't PCs. ...Er, right? Yeah, Apple said so, so they aren't. They get **Mac** viruses, not PC viruses.  Also, the word ""Virus"" only describes malware which self-replicates from computer-to-computer. Welcome to semantics, where you can say *anything* if you apply a technical enough definition.   I hope Mac users understand what people mean when they refer to the ""Apple Reality Distortion Field‚Ñ¢"". It's not that Apple *lies*. It's that they twist words so much that they manage to say whatever they want and fool most people who see the advertising.  The average consumer doesn't understand that Apple doesn't consider their computers ""PCs"", so the phrase ""Doesn't get PC viruses"" fools them into thinking that it can't get viruses. And then a Mac-adept will swoop in and say ""Well, it can't get *viruses* at all, because [insert ultra-specific technical definition of a virus]"", even though the average user does not differentiate between ""viruses"" and general ""malware"".  And there are plenty of other examples. How they call OSX the ""World's most advanced operating system""; any technically-literate person would tell you that ""most advanced"" is an ambiguous term that's impossible to define. Or how they say their support is ""award winning"", but they don't list the awards anywhere. Or how they call their displays ""retina"", even though there's [controversey](http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2010/06/iphone-4-retina/) over whether that's a valid term. Or how they claimed that the A5x was ""4x more powerful"" than the Tegra 3, without listing which benchmarks they used; in reality, [the Tegra 3 destroys the A5x on CPU,](http://www.redmondpie.com/a5-vs.-a5x-vs.-tegra-3-thoroughly-benchmarked-the-winner-is-rather-surprising/) the A5x does about 2x better off-screen graphics, and in day-to-day graphics usage (IE, on-screen), they more-or-less tie.

t5_2qh6c,IRBMe,1334130534,"&gt; We so often hear that children should not be indoctrinated into religion by teaching in public schools, but it's worth remembering that there's no reason to believe that indoctrination into atheism will be any less harmful.  Yes, it would be awful!  The kids would start the day by praying to Hitchens, before singing Satanic death metal.  Each of the classrooms would have a little model coffin, each with a little Bertrand Russel inside, nailed to the walls and posters of the Flying Spaghetti Monster up everywhere.  There would be a mandatory class dedicated to reading and studying The God Delusion.  Each week, the kids would be taken to the local Sam Harris Worship Building (¬©) for their periodic Atheist Sermon, where they would listen to quotes from atheist philosophers and sing John Lennon's Imagine - original lyrics, of course.  At the age of 10, they would be required to take part in a confirmation ceremony in which they denounce all religion, take the blasphemy challenge and confirm their atheism.  Eventually, atheists would start to open their own universities and colleges where they can continue their education with an atheist slant. Biology classes would remind students that evolution clearly disproves creationism and physics classes would explain that God is not required to explain the origins of the universe. There would be strict rules and regulations. Any student found with a Bible or a Qu'ran would be severely disciplined.  Eventually atheism would turn into a recognized subject at all universities across the world. Students would study The God Delusion and learn of the much more subtle interpretations than they had learned in school, they would study atheist philosophers, atheist history, arguments for atheism and so on.  More Churches of Sam Harris would spread across the world, but there would be disagreements! The church would fragment into two schools of thought: the Sam Harris denomination and the Hitchens denomination. Further fragmentation would result in the Church of Russel, the Church of Dawkins of the Latter Day Saints, and the Dennettons.  Oh, the humanity! We must stop this atheist indoctrination before it begins! It starts with one student in Bible class saying ""*Well that's stupid*"" and before you know it, you have Dawkins Worshippers knocking on your door early on Sunday mornings and ""*In reason we trust*"" printed on your money.",¬©

t5_2r4oc,Valkyrja_bc,1334182901,"It really does sound like The Eagles' Brood, third in the series, here's a review of the book:  In the author's The Skystone (1996), set in the last years of the Roman occupation of fifth-century Britain, the sword Excalibur was forged, presaging the reign of King Arthur years later. This time, the narrator, grand-nephew of the forger of the sword, is none other than that (traditionally) eerie being, Merlin the sorcerer--sanitized here to the most high-minded of soldiers who survives wars, betrayal, and a tragic love affair. Caius Merlyn Britannicus, born in a.d. 401, is the son of the Commander in Chief of the forces of the fortress/town of Camulod, a community of Romans and Britons. Merlyn's best friend from boyhood is his cousin Uther Pendragon, a mighty warrior and the son of a Celtic king, though with a terrible temper that can show itself off the fields of war. Torturing Merlyn is the suspicion that it might have been Uther who brutally beat the waif whom Merlyn will name Cassandra after she violently resists Uther's sexual games. The deaf and dumb Cassandra (her real identity will be a surprise) is healed and then secluded, eventually becoming Merlyn's wife until her savage death. There are wars and invasions, waged principally by King Lot of Cornwall, wars that bring awful innovations like poisoned arrows. There are also theological conflicts, since the free-will doctrines of Pelagius are condemned as heretical by the Church. Merlyn's trek to a seminal debate of theologians is marked by skirmishes--he rescues the warrior/bishop Germanus at one point--and by the discovery of a half-brother. All ends with the deaths of those fierce antagonists Lot and Uther, and with Merlyn holding up Uther's baby son by Lot's dead queen, a baby who has ``the deep golden eyes of . . . a mighty bird of prey . . . a King perhaps, to wield Excalibur.'' With plenty of hacking and stabbing, pontifications, dogged sex, and a few anachronistic mind-sets: another dipperful from the fertile Arthurian well, sans magic but brimful of action. -- Copyright ¬©1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

t5_2qk68,TheLastBoyScout,1334254659,"Im sure others will post some of this too, but I'm just going to run down my list and what I learned playing in the rain.      ‚ô† Good Rain Gear that breaths... That sounds dumb I know, but being able to control your body temp and not get too hot or too cold is important.      ‚ô† Gore-Tex (or similar products like Keen-Dry) Shoes help a lot. However, just remember that if water gets over the top of the tongue of the shoe, they will get and stay wet.      ‚ô† Have a back up of everything.... Clothes, Shoes, Socks, etc. If you get wet be sure to change first thing in between rounds. Fresh, dry clothes, socks, and shoes could be the difference maker. While you are dry and happy, someone is soggy and miserable.      ‚ô† Bring a large golf umbrella. The bigger the umbrella, the easier it is to keep your bag on your stool and off the wet ground, yet its still small enough to remain under the umbrella and dry while you are putting.      ‚ô† Bring a really small and compact umbrella. This way, if it looks like rain, but you don't want to carry your golf umbrella, its small enough to fit in your bag out of the way if you do need it.      ‚ô† Buy a leather chamois. I love these things. They work better than those microfiber towels or synthetic shammys or sham-wows. Leather chamois (or shammys) work best when wet and ring out easily. It will make any disc, no matter how wet it is, dry and grippy. Just be sure to slightly pull and stretch the chamois when it is drying so it remains supple and smooth to the touch. You don't want a rough chamois.      ‚ô† Bring extra towels and put them in a ziplock bag. This way you have dry towels in the bag if you really need them. If you have a leather chamois, you shouldn't really need them.      ‚ô† A pair of waterproof socks are a real deal maker. If you cant get Rocky (Gore-Tex) or Seal Skinz (the cheaper version of Gore-Tex), then use this old trick from Scouts: Bring 2 bags that bread comes in and 2 rubber bands to hold the tops of the bags up and to keep water from getting in. I've told people to do this before, and as they told me, they feel dumb when they first put them on, but were so happy at the end of the round when their shoes were wet, but their feet and socks were dry.      ‚ô† If you struggle with gripping your discs at all, bring some windex in a small spray bottle and put it in your bag. Also, take a wash rag and soak it in windex then put it in a ziplock bag. If you dry your disc off, the wipe it down with the windex rag, and wipe down your hand, you will remove any residual water and oils and have a super tacky grip. This also works well for regular play if you struggle with discs slipping out of your grip.      ‚ô† Bring an exercise band. Most people really don't want to go out and practice in the rain, so using an exercise band will help you get loose and stay loose. Also, the extra movements will help you warm up if you start to feel a little cold or the temperature drops any. Also, if its raining and you can find a dry spot to stay out of the rain, ask someone to play catch with. Get about 15 feet away and take turns ""putting"" at the other person stomach. Makeshift baskets FTW.      **PRO-TIP:** If your Gore-Tex shoes get wet and you need to dry them, this generally is a big no-no. There is a trick though, you want to hang the shoes up against the inside of the dryer door, and let the shoe laces hang over the top. This way when you shut the dryer door, the shoes stay up against the door and don't make a huge banging racket. Now, you only want to dry the shoes until they are slightly damp. The Gore-Tex material will actually start to degrade in heat, so you just want them to get to where they are nice and steamy, and almost dry. This amount of heat will allow the Gore-Tex material to shrink just enough to restore any waterproofness. This means if you have a pair of Gore-Tex shoes that are leaking, clean them up really well, get them soaking wet inside and out, and then dry them almost all the way. After they finish air drying they should be totally waterproof again. As always, I suggest using a Gore-Tex approved wash to help maintain the Gore-Tex material and as an added protection against water. I learned this from a Rep. for Gore-Tex.",‚ô†

t5_2qzb6,huzzy,1334261218,"Somewhat correct.   Love is not *entirely* missing prior to marriage, it usually exists before marriage in most cases.  Granted that before marriage, interactions between man and woman are limited, this love may be weak since the couple have not gotten to know each other that well.    However as time goes on, and if the love is fostered and nurtured properly, it will only grow.   Therefore it is possible that you love someone more after 40 years of marriage than when you first met that person given the fact you've shared a lot of experiences with that person and have gotten to know that person better.

t5_2qh68,Slappy_MC_Garglenutz,1334262083,"[Here's the pic of the lynx.](http://i.imgur.com/48zMU.jpg)  And a quoted copy of the article:    He weighs in at up to 14 kilograms, but thanks to his enormous feet shaped almost like snowshoes, looks as though he is floating on air as he ambles along the snow.  His legs are long and powerful, his coat is thick and grey, and the patches of fur that frame his face look like the kind of beard sported by aristocrats.  When Trevor Kinley opened up his e-mail earlier this week, he saw the subject heading ‚ÄúA Little Morning Surprise‚Äù and the photograph of the majestic beast.  ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt help but be struck by how beautiful it is,‚Äù says Kinley of the March 28 photograph of the animal known as the Canadian lynx.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôve only had a glimpse of one in the wild, so to capture such a clear image is a rare treat.‚Äù  What was an even bigger treat for Kinley, a biologist and road ecologist for Parks Canada, is the precise location for the photograph: the Redearth Creek overpass in Banff National Park, just a few kilometres up the road from the Sunshine Village ski area.  The overpass is one of six that are part of the wildlife-crossing project in Banff National Park.  Combined with 38 underpasses along the stretch of Trans-Canada Highway that cuts through this wildlife-rich area, the intent of the crossings is to keep the number of animal deaths on the highway to an absolute minimum, thus ensuring that nature‚Äôs balance is retained.  Started in 1996, the project has included not only the building of animal crossings throughout the park, but also the ongoing monitoring of their effectiveness.  For years, the way researchers kept tabs on usage was through old-fashioned tracking of animal prints. In recent years, motion-sensitive cameras have filled in much more effectively.  ‚ÄúThe remote cameras are left there for weeks at a time,‚Äù says Kinley.  Every three weeks or so, someone goes in and retrieves the data from the cameras and reviews them.  ‚ÄúMost of the time, we see bears, deer, elk,‚Äù he says.  But this time, there it was ‚Äî a National Geographic-worthy image of the elusive Canadian lynx.  This is partly due, Kinley notes, to the relatively lower numbers of the species in the park. Estimates are only in the dozens for this animal that prefers to roam in high evergreen forests.  The other reason is that the majority of the lynx that call Banff National Park home prefer the environs around Lake Louise, where the latest passes have only recently been ready for use.  ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll find more bears east, more lynx west,‚Äù Kinley says.  Add to that the fact that lynx have proven to be more wary of the passes than other wildlife ‚Äî ‚Äútheir learning curve appears to be much higher,‚Äù says Kinley ‚Äî makes for only the most rare of sightings even for those who spend their time tracking animals.  ‚ÄúIt was like he was posing for us,‚Äù says Tony Clevenger of the March 28 photograph. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like he‚Äôs floating on top of the snow ‚Äî it‚Äôs really compelling.‚Äù  Like Kinley, Clevenger, who works with the Western Transportation Institute, is also excited about it, but for other reasons.  ‚ÄúNow, we can start to study more closely what they respond to, and look at such factors as crossing dimension and fencing,‚Äù says Clevenger, who is one of the world‚Äôs foremost roadway ecology experts.  ‚ÄúIt is going to be an exciting time for us, to get a much better understanding of this particular animal.‚Äù  A research collaboration between Parks Canada and the Miistakis Institute, the monitoring project is one that has caught the attention of conservationists around the world.  Its hefty price tag ‚Äî wildlife mitigation measures are estimated to account for nearly one-third of the $310-million cost of the Trans-Canada Highway twinning project from Castle Junction to the B.C. border alone ‚Äî and other aspects of the 15-year project have met with some controversy.  But those in the field say there‚Äôs no denying that Banff National Park now serves as a model for effective management of human-wildlife conflict.  Over the past few years, Clevenger has worked with groups in Colorado and Washington state that use the Banff model: ‚ÄúI always call Banff the only laboratory in the world where we can do this research.‚Äù  While the successes accumulate, it‚Äôs still a rare treat for those devoted to their preservation to see the Canadian lynx is in its grand, natural state.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been doing this research for more than 15 years, and that‚Äôs probably the best image I‚Äôve seen of a lynx,‚Äù says Clevenger. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm looking forward to seeing more in the future.‚Äù  Valerie Fortney is a Calgary Herald columnist.  vfortney@calgaryherald.com ¬© Copyright (c) The Calgary Herald",¬©

t5_2cneq,ucccft,1334330475,"(CBS News) Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa), the senior Republican on a Senate committee overseeing immigration and visa policy is calling for action following a CBS News report featuring whistleblower Jay Palmer.  Palmer, a principal consultant for Infosys, accuses the tech giant of putting Americans out of work by illegally bringing in foreign workers at lower wages.  ""CBS This Morning"" featured Palmer's story on Thursday.  Now, Grassley is pressing for ""a thorough investigation by the Departments of State and Homeland Security of the B-1 visa program.""  The B-1 visa allows foreign companies to send employees to the U.S. for meetings. But Palmer says Infosys was sending them to the U.S. for jobs.  (Watch John Miller's original report below.) Grassley said, ""If you're bringing them here to work full time and maybe cheaper labor, it's not only against the law, it's immoral and unjustified and unethical.""  Palmer says the practice displaced American workers qualified for the same jobs, but, he charges, it increased profits.  Palmer said, ""For example...if I'm gonna pay you $15,000 a year, why would I pay an American or a legal worker $65,000 a year? It makes no - it's just economics.""  Ron Hira, an expert on immigration and visa policy, told CBS News the problem is bigger than just one company. ""A number of companies, very profitable, large companies that are expanding very rapidly are exploiting loopholes that should be closed,"" he said.  Palmer says after he blew the whistle, Infosys retaliated against him. Now he is suing the company. Infosys categorically denies all of Palmer's allegations, saying they will address the facts in court.  On ""CBS This Morning"" Friday, CBS News senior correspondent John Miller said the State Department has acknowledged that the B-1 visa program needs more oversight because of the potential fraud.  Miller said, ""I think one of the things that has irked Sen. Grassley, is in 2011, the company in this story, and there are others, applied for 4,700 more of these worker visas on the idea that they needed nearly 5,000 people that had skills so specialized that no American computer worker could do them.""  The living conditions of the people who come to the U.S., Miller said, are of concern also to Palmer and fellow Infosys employee Marti Harrington.

Add to that, the clients I've built the site for have an even more limited understanding of how the internet works, let alone how Drupal works (think Elk's Club, Freemasons, or Knights of Columbus). Aside from a few CCK fields added for events and one or two views, there's nothing custom.   This was a completely volunteer undertaking. I would have preferred to start in 7, but at that point (seven months ago) a lot of modules I was looking to use weren't ready. They have a basic ""out of the box"" site with a few text pages, a FAQ, Chat, and a members only area with forums and events they can sign up for.   The fact that you can bolt on modules that dramatically add to the functionality of this site was a huge selling point. So was the straightforward ""Fill out these for fields, and hit publish, and you're all set"" method for building their own content. I felt it would be a disservice to make things more complicated than they needed to be, for both myself and them.  I would still call it a Drupal Success Story‚Ñ¢.

A mesh liner allows air to reach baby's skin, and an absorbent core wicks moisture away from the surface to promote dryness.

t5_2cneq,greengordon,1334336541,"From the paper you cited:  &gt;We found crop yields to be 20% lower in the organic systems, **although input of fertilizer and energy was reduced by 34 to 53% and pesticide input by 97%. Enhanced soil fertility and higher biodiversity found in organic plots may render these systems less dependent on external inputs.**  The factors I emphasized are going to become increasingly important as climate change changes growing conditions.   Here are sample results of some [long-term US studies](http://www.rodaleinstitute.org/fst30years/yields):  * Over the 30 years of the trial, organic corn and soybean yields were equivalent to conventional yields in the tilled systems.  * Wheat yields were the same for organic and conventional systems. (Wheat was only added to the conventional system in 2004). * Organic corn yields were 31% higher than conventional in years of drought. These drought yields are remarkable when compared to genetically engineered ‚Äúdrought tolerant‚Äù varieties which saw increases of only 6.7% to 13.3% over conventional (non-drought resistant) varieties. * Corn and soybean crops in the organic systems tolerated much higher levels of weed competition than their conventional counterparts, while producing equivalent yields. This is especially significant given the rise of herbicide-resistant weeds in conventional systems, and speaks to the increased health and productivity of the organic soil (supporting both weeds and crop yields).  * Farmers who cultivated GM varieties earned less money over a 14-year period than those who continued to grow non-GM crops according to a study from the University of Minnesota. * Traditional plant breeding and farming methods have increased yields of major grain crops three to four times more than GM varieties despite huge investments of public and private dollars in biotech research. * There are 197 species of herbicide resistant weeds, many of which can be linked directly back to GM crops, and the list keeps growing. * GM crops have led to an explosion in herbicide-use as resistant crops continue to emerge. In particular, the EPA approved a 20-fold increase in how much glyphosate (Roundup¬Æ) residue is allowed in our food in response to escalating concentrations.",¬Æ

Here's the full post:  &gt;The new Quentin Tarantino movie Django Unchained is set to be released this year and we have now been given the official movie poster for the movie, as well as the official movie synopsis. The Weinstein Company has described Django Unchained as follows:   &gt;Set in the South two years before the Civil War, ""Django Unchained"" stars Academy Award¬Æ-winner Jamie Foxx as Django, a slave whose brutal history with his former owners lands him face-to-face with German-born bounty hunter Dr. King Schultz (Academy Award¬Æ-winner Christoph Waltz). Schultz is on the trail of the murderous Brittle brothers, and only Django can lead him to his bounty. The unorthodox Schultz acquires Django with a promise to free him upon the capture of the Brittles ‚Äì dead or alive.    &gt;Success leads Schultz to free Django, though the two men choose not to go their separate ways. Instead, Schultz seeks out the South‚Äôs most wanted criminals with Django by his side. Honing vital hunting skills, Django remains focused on one goal: finding and rescuing Broomhilda (Kerry Washington), the wife he lost to the slave trade long ago.  &gt;Django and Schultz‚Äôs search ultimately leads them to Calvin Candie (Academy Award¬Æ-nominee Leonardo DiCaprio), the proprietor of ‚ÄúCandyland,‚Äù an infamous plantation where slaves are groomed by trainer Ace Woody (Kurt Russell) to battle each other for sport. Exploring the compound under false pretenses, Django and Schultz arouse the suspicion of Stephen (Academy Award¬Æ-nominee Samuel L. Jackson), Candie's trusted house slave. Their moves are marked, and a treacherous organization closes in on them. If Django and Schultz are to escape with Broomhilda, they must choose between independence and solidarity, between sacrifice and survival...    &gt;Written and directed by Academy Award¬Æ-winner Quentin Tarantino, DJANGO UNCHAINED is produced by Stacey Sher, Pilar Savone and Reginald Hudlin. The executive producers are Harvey and Bob Weinstein, Michael Shamberg, Shannon McIntosh, and James Skotchdopole. DJANGO UNCHAINED will be released in the U.S. on December 25, 2012, and internationally by Sony Pictures Releasing International.*       &gt;Django Unchained stars Jamie Foxx, Leonardo DiCaprio, Samuel L Jackson, Kerry Washington, Sacha Baron Cohen and Kurt Russell.

t5_mouw,susanmariez,1334367945," http://neriumskin.com/research/science.htm 	  Cold Sore (HSV-1) Study ST&amp;T initiated a pilot study on human subjects that provided for testing a topical application for  Cold Sores (HSV-1) utilizing the Nerium SkinCare topical formulation Nerium CS‚Ñ¢. ST&amp;T initiated this pilot study to test the safety and efficacy of the Nerium natural topical oleander-based antiseptic solution, Nerium CS‚Ñ¢, to help promote and speed the healing, reduce symptoms, and/or to mitigate and reduce pain and the spreading of skin irruptions or wounds to mouth areas [lip lesions, pimples, blemishes, fever blisters, or active cold sore(s)]. Study Aim/Purpose: The specific aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the natural Nerium topical  oleander-based antiseptic solution, Nerium CS‚Ñ¢, in volunteers with lip lesions, pimples, blemishes,  fever blisters, or active cold sore(s). Subjects enrolled were all healthy, with no significant medical history. All had lip lesions, pimples, blemishes, fever blisters, active cold sore(s) thought to be related to the Herpes Simplex Virus type 1 [HSV-1] (in lab cultures/tests of volunteers, 80% showed a positive results for HSV-1 and there were 20% who had sores/lesions related to another underlying  cause). It is estimated that recurrent HSV -1 (cold sores of the mouth area) alone affects approximately 20-40%  (some figures suggest as high as 80%) of the adult population in the United States. The frequency of the disease among affected individuals varies from rare episodes to 12 or more recurrences per year. Although there are a variety of intravenous, oral and topical antiviral drug agents tested in clinical  research settings which have shown efficacy against herpes lesions, there is a need for over-the-counter  natural antiseptic products with proven efficacy, to help lessen and/or mitigate the symptoms. Background-Viral Related Skin Eruptions/Vesicles: Upon contact with the body, HSV-1 penetrates susceptible cells and begins to replicate itself with cell nuclei, destroying host cells. Clinically, there are five stages of this type of skin infection: Prodromal Stage: a generalized precursor of herpes infection becomes evident about 6 to 48 hours before a cold sore is visible, subject may feel tingling, burning, itching, numbness, tenderness, or pain in the affected area, even symptoms consisting of mild malasia, fever and localized lymphadenopathy, which can occur with HSV-1. The infection then proceeds into a localized skin reaction. Erythema Stage: an erythematous reaction, or localized redness without induration. Papular Stage: begins with induration, or hardening of the skin. Vesicle Stage: The vesicular stage begins with destruction of host cells causing painful eruption of vesicles. Ulcer Stage: The blisters ulcerate and form a crust, drying out and healing rapidly. When the crust falls  off, the virus is no longer transmissible, or contagious. The mean duration of recurrence is 7-12 days, and sometimes up to 2 weeks or more. The viral  particles persist in its latent form, without symptoms, in the neural ganglia until recurrence. Viral  replication usually occurs at the same site, triggered by a variety of different factors, such as  sunlight, physical, environmental or emotional stress and cell destruction with subsequent vesicle  formation begins again. It is suggested that viral shedding begins prior to vesicle formation. Clinical Summary: In the study of this natural Nerium oleander-based topical antiseptic solution, Nerium CS‚Ñ¢, it was found that its effectiveness help promote and speed the healing, reduce symptoms, and/or to mitigate and reduce pain and the spreading of skin irruptions or wounds to outside mouth areas  in form of lip lesions, pimples, blemishes, fever blisters, or active cold sore(s) / HSV-1. The Nerium topical solution was faster than or equal to traditional drug therapies, though it was found that its greatest success on inhibiting and/or clearing of vesicles was if it is applied early, before or at the early onset of the outbreak. Participant blood samples were done at visit day 1 (screening) and at the study conclusion (their  last visit). A comprehensive blood chemistry panel was run to test for oleandrin absorption and accumulation in the blood. From results of the blood test, there were no adverse reactions noted,  blood analysis showed all subjects within normal ranges, and that there was no detectable CG‚Äôs  in the blood.   The subjects were enrolled for the natural Nerium CS‚Ñ¢ treatment duration of 10-26 days depending  on the severity of cold sore and time they took to heal. On average, subjects where the Nerium  antiseptic solution was applied at stage 1-2 (Prodromal or Erythema), rarely progressed to other  stages and vesicles cleared within two days. Subjects who were seen in stage 3-4 (Papular or Vesicle) before applying the antiseptic solution experienced a healing time of two to four days on  average, other subjects presenting at stages 3, 4, or 5 (Papular, Vesicle, or Ulcer) had varying results from 3-5 days on average and up to 10 days or more (likely dependent upon the infection  or viral load, environmental considerations, i.e. stressors, diet, sun [UV radiation] exposure, etc.). Solution effectiveness was apparent, (faster than or equal to traditional drug therapies),  though it had greatest success on inhibiting and/or clearing vesicles if applied before or at the  early onset of the outbreak.

VAT)**   * **Color:**  Blush wine, or a reddish apple juice.   * **Nose (neat):** Peat, smoke, butter, seawater, malt, warm spices (cinnamon, cardamom, nutmeg), apples, cider vinegar.  * **Nose (w/ water):** Similar to neat, but with butter, seawater, and warm spices brought into foreground.  A little estery pear appears.   * **Mouth Feel (neat):** Prickly, burning on tongue; oddly, the texture is also smooth and round.  Peppery burn stays in the mouth, but doesn't proceed down the throat.  * **Mouth Feel (w/ water):** Much less prickly, with a more oily texture.  Very pronounced and pleasant change over neat.  * **Taste (neat):** Peppery blast!  Cayenne pepper, black pepper, apples, peat smoke, salt, buttery sweetness.  * **Taste (w/ water):** Pepper diminishes substantially, becoming more briny, buttery, and sweet.  More peat smoke develops as well.   * **Finish (neat):** Medium length finish; pepper quickly diminishes, leaving behind a warming tingle.  Finish becomes increasingly mild, creamy, and smooth with flavors of butter, smoky peat, oak, and eventually hints of apple.  * **Finish (w/ water):** Same as above but richer and smoother.  Lingering fruit is better defined - dried apples.  &gt;Taste:  69/75  &gt;Value:  13/15  &gt;Uniqueness:  5/5  &gt;Buy Again?:   4/5  &gt;**Total Score: 91/100**  Talisker 10's peppery palate is distinctive and warming, being entirely appropriate for the day I spent fishing in the damp, windy cold.  Although the spicy mouthfeel is quite striking, I am even more impressed by the finesse of Talisker 10's nose.  The aromas are enticing, complex, and evolving.  This whisky has one of the best noses I've encountered, and I am content to sniff it for some time.    This dram is great neat and offers a deliciously dramatic change when water is added.  Both ways are great, but they are fairly different experiences.  I prefer Talisker 10 with a bit of water, as I find it becomes richer and less intensely peppery.  I noticed a substantial change with even a small amount water, so proceed slowly.   ",‚Ñ¢

Maybe you could even talk to agence7seven. I've no idea if they're expensive though.    EDIT: You could also look at [this recent highly NSFW flash game](http://konashion.blogspot.co.uk/2010/11/super-deepthroat.html) for inspiration. Maybe something like that might work in your game too. Well, maybe, or maybe not.  On the other hand, you could, even with the Silicone Valley performers, pull off a *[Call On Me](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_fCqg92qks)* [production](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_on_Me_%28Eric_Prydz_song%29), and manage to sex things up to the max and beyond without ever showing a single [Janet Jackson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janet_Jackson%27s_nipple), and thereby technically still qualify for non-adult industry retail channels.  I'm sure if you get performers like the aforementioned, Fox News would love to loop the outrage [porn](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHEXzlNHC8Q), and whoever the current [Brent Bozell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L._Brent_Bozell_III) is would have a field day with this.

t5_2qhkh,foty8,1334462052,"http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/hs104  Propagation  Leafy Stem Cuttings. This is the most feasible method to propagate large quantities of plants. Leafy stem cuttings may be propagated from the apical 4‚Äì6 inches of cane when the cane is succulent but still firm. Application of Rootone¬Æ to the cut stem can also improve rooting efficiency. Cuttings should be placed to a depth of 2 inches in a perlite and peat or peat and sand mixture. The cuttings should be misted, especially in the two- to four-week period before the roots are formed. It is important to promote good water drainage.  Root Cuttings. All blackberries can be propagated by root cuttings. This is the fastest method to produce new plants. Cut roots ¬º‚Äì¬Ω inch in diameter into 6-inch pieces. They can be directly planted in the new location, grown as a potted plant, or placed in a plastic bag in a refrigerator. When planted directly in the field, uneven stands often result during the first year. Potted plants can be grown in the nursery for up to one year. When planted in soil, they should be covered with 2‚Äì4 inches of soil. Planting is best accomplished during the winter. Substantial quantities of suitable roots can be had by plowing a furrow and severing the roots adjacent to the mother plant.  Suckering. The easiest and most rapid method to propagate blackberry is to utilize the suckers that naturally form from roots. Simply sever the sucker from the point of attachment with the mother plant and move it to its desired location. Removing suckers has minimal or no impact on the mother plant. Genetically thorny blackberry cultivars will remain thorny and genetically thornless blackberry cultivars will remain thornless whether propagated from stem cuttings, root cuttings, or suckers.  Tip Layering. Semi-erect or trailing blackberries can be propagated by tip layering. Tip layering sometimes occurs in nature and is a viable method for the homeowner to propagate relatively few plants. The technique is to bring first-year vegetative shoots into contact with the ground and cover the shoot under approximately 3 inches of soil. A more efficient method of tip layering is to remove the shoot apex to induce lateral branching. Next, during the summer, dig a 3-inch-deep hole that slopes toward the mother plant and vertically away from the plant. Place the terminal end of the shoot in the hole and cover the shoot with three inches of soil. By the fall, the shoots will have produced roots and the plant can be transplanted.",¬Æ

t5_2rfxx,Readorn,1334497286,"1.Where is pause? It's a mandatory feature in every MOBA game honestly. There should be no excuse. I don't mind replays but there are countless times where it is 4v5 because of a disconnect causing an instant loss.  Soon‚Ñ¢ ,they said they work on it..But yeah it really sucks that a company such as Riot cant actually deliver sooner.  2.Why aren't rune pages like... mastery pages? Why can't you just configure them in game @_@. Are they just really a money-making scheme in order to make people buy rp or utilize IP to buy runes/rune pages? Just curious. It's one of those interesting features that I don't completely understand...  Probably because it would lead to server loads and incredible bugs..We have all felt bad when we realize ingame that we have no masteries.Immagine that with runes &gt;_&gt;  3.Instead of making rune pages 6300 ip... why not make them something more reasonable zZz and/or increase the cost of runes while making the cost of rune pages lower?  No.  4.Is ryze ever going to get a nerf? Looking at all the recent PBE (pre-released patch notes and whatnot) there seems to be no indication of nerfing ryze, a hero that's concept is broken because of the fact that he is a mage that scales by building TANKY. Also he has a high amount of sustain when he builds wota + R. He is also a scary laner because of the W + jungler gank issue. His W is instant which means flash snares are so easy... There are very few instant stunner/snare heroes i.e. tf/amumu. Something needs to be changed.  He is balanced but annoying to play against according to some.For him to get nerfed they need to nerf the items he gets meaning directly nerfing a lot of casters and tanks in the process.They could nerf the scaling but would he be able to compete against other casters?Personally i think his whole redesign was wrong to begin with but thats just me .  5.Is Shen ever going to get nerfed? The fact he is able to outsustain almost anyone while being tanky + his power of splitpushing &gt; forcing 4v5s or pressuring other maps is ridiculous. Also his utility the moment he hits 6 prevents almost anyone from diving and very few can counter this. FIX :( He is instabanned every game for a reason and the games he is in almost lead to 2 things. 1. the shen sucks cause he never practiced it or 2. the shen pwns cause it's solo q and people throw/dive all day  If we get the time it gets them to release the stealth rework,the time it gets them to release ""pause"",the time it gets them to balance melee champions,the time it gets them do really basic stuff for the game,i doubt that Shen will get nerfed anytime soon.Approx i believe in about 1-2 months after some major tournament,after M5 plays Shen they will nerf him,maybe.They could at least nerf the range of his ultimate TF,Pantheon like.  6.Janna... her passive has to be nerfed. As someone who mains AP seeing my opponent have 30 movement speed more than me simply because of masteries/runes + JANNA = ridiculous. I just can't space against him (keep the same amount of distance) and he can simply get free spells off. Likewise, you can't even chase if he goes to roam as he is innately faster...  Heracim + MS runes + MS masteries + Janna = Free Dives all day,cause he moves too fast trolololololo.But yeah she needs a nerf,but hey u know lets reduce the ultimates mana cost,cause its the right thing to do.  7.any chance of being able to move realm to realm while having everything (runes/masteries/acc etc.) in the nearby future @_@ or does it not work because of the name issue  You cant,EU ppl who play on NA ask for this the last 2 years,no responce yet.There is a thread in the NA forums prolly necro by now.  9.An oracle limit should be placed. Oracles are vital to winning the map and sometimes supports don't even need anything except wards/oracles. The instant someone dies with an oracle... well, sometimes they just re-buy it. I think a 7 minute cooldown or something should be placed on it. Map vision is crucial and if you just keep re-buying stuff (yes i know how you lose oracles upon death) like that...  With the stealth rework,something will be done about this too probably.But hey the stealth rework was announced a year ago...yeah..  10.Am I the only one that sees infinite wards fking op? Dunno, as a pre-dota/hon player I understood the importance of wards... Whenever I play support, I have 15 wards in my inventory and place them everywhere... Why don't people do this?

Section 1b says  &gt; use the Game in conjunction with the Service for your noncommercial entertainment purposes only  There's Blizzard's line which can require a separate license for any commercial use of the game. I believe this includes LAN parties promoting the game as a tournament, even if they are not *distributing* the game (although such is actually allowed by the end user via Section 1c).  Section 2c is a little more explicit regarding commercial use. The user shall not:  &gt; Exploit the Game or any of its parts for any commercial purpose without Blizzard‚Äôs express permission, with the sole exception that you may use the Game, or copies of the Game, on the Service at a cyber cafe, computer gaming center or any other location based site;  Section 2f might also prohibit tournaments, since they are matchmaking services, however luddite:  &gt; Host, provide or develop matchmaking services for the Game or intercept, emulate or redirect the communication protocols used by Blizzard in any way, for any purpose, including without limitation unauthorized play over the internet, network play (except as expressly authorized by Blizzard), or as part of content aggregation networks;  Their right to terminate your license at any time is in Section 9:  &gt; Blizzard may terminate this Agreement at any time for any reason or no reason.  Section 12 is where it's really meaty:  &gt; The Game is capable of both offline and online player modes, both of which require that you obtain authorized access to the Service. **You understand and agree that the Service is provided by Blizzard at its discretion and may be terminated or otherwise discontinued by Blizzard pursuant to the Terms of Use**.  (emphasis mine)  Having exhausted the relevant stuff in the SC2 EULA, let's switch to the Blizzard ToU.  Blizzard sets forth the difference between the two agreements in paragraph 1:  &gt; The EULA governs your use of the Game client ‚Äì that part of any Game installed on your computer ‚Äì and this Agreement governs your use of the Service.  And then defines that it's for non-commercial use only, which further clouds the issue:  &gt; you may use the Service solely for your own non-commercial entertainment purposes by accessing it with a web browser or an authorized, unmodified Game client  And then we find the coup de grace. You may not under any circumstances:  &gt; B. exploit the Service, a Game or any part thereof for any commercial purpose, including without limitation: (a) using the Service at a cyber cafe, computer gaming center or any other commercial establishment without the express written consent of Blizzard, unless otherwise stated in a Game EULA; **(b) communicate or facilitate any commercial advertisement or solicitation**; (c) gather in-game currency, items or resources for sale outside the Game without Blizzard‚Äôs authorization; or (d) perform in-game services in exchange for payment outside the Game, e.g., power-leveling;  &gt;**C. use the Service for any ‚Äúe-sports‚Äù or group competition sponsored, promoted or facilitated by any commercial or non-profit entity without Blizzard‚Äôs prior written consent;**  This section 2c is what really mandates the tournament license. Emphasis mine. Section 2f echoes the SC2 EULA section 2f:  &gt; F. host, provide or develop matchmaking services for any Game or the Service, or intercept, emulate or redirect the communication protocols used by Blizzard in any way, for any purpose, including without limitation unauthorized play over the Internet, network play, or as part of content aggregation networks;  Section 7 outlines how Blizzard is allow to suspend accounts:  &gt; ACCOUNT SUSPENSION/CANCELATION. BLIZZARD MAY SUSPEND, TERMINATE, MODIFY, OR DELETE ACCOUNTS **AT ANY TIME FOR ANY REASON OR FOR NO REASON**, WITH OR WITHOUT NOTICE TO YOU. Accounts terminated by Blizzard for any type of abuse, including without limitation a violation of these TOU, a Game-specific Terms of Use, or a Game EULA will not be reactivated for any reason.  Section 12b(a) essentially says that you're not allowed to attack their service. I'm not a sysadmin, but if I got a ton of connections from the same IP when I'd normally get only one or two from any specific IP, I'd probably think that something was up.  &gt; (a) institute, assist, or become involved in any type of attack, including without limitation denial of service attacks, upon the Service or otherwise attempt to disrupt the Service or any other person‚Äôs use of the Service;   The Battle.net ToU doesn't have [binding arbitration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitration), but SC2 EULA does.  **TL;DR** Blizzard can do anything they want to your access to the game at any time and there's nothing you can do about it without getting lawyers involved, and that'll probably not make Blizzard want to restore your access or ever do business with you again.

t5_2qh2p,Dudesan,1334510799,"Remember, many Christians find it more comfortable to believe in a god who doesn't condone, command or commit murder, slavery, rape, child abuse, animal abuse, arson, torture, ritual mutilation, fratricide, patricide, matricide, infanticide, genocide, and so on than to believe in one who does.  Unfortunately, since the Bible (Old Testamant and New) is pretty clear about Yahweh's position on these things, holding a belief in Loving Hippie Jesus‚Ñ¢ requires ignoring huge portions of it. Or just never reading it in the first place, which seems to be the most popular option.  Well, let's say what Jesus has to say about that:  &gt;‚ÄúDo not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished.  (Matthew 5:17-18, NIV)  Some Christians claim that his death and resurrection ""fulfill"" this. That is bullshit for one simple reason: last time I checked, Heaven and Earth haven't passed away.  Jesus also made his views on people ""picking and choosing"" quite clear:  &gt;[Jesus] answered them, ‚ÄúAnd why do you break God‚Äôs commandment because of your tradition? For God said:    *Honor your father and your mother;* and, *The one who speaks evil of father or mother must be put to death.*  &gt; But you say, ‚ÄòWhoever tells his father or mother, ‚ÄúWhatever benefit you might have received from me is a gift committed to the temple‚Äù‚Äî  he does not have to honor his father.‚Äô In this way, you have revoked God‚Äôs word because of your tradition. Hypocrites! Isaiah prophesied correctly about you when he said:    &gt;These people honor Me with their lips, but their heart is far from Me.  They worship Me in vain, teaching as doctrines the commands of men.‚Äù  (Matthew 15:3-9, NIV)   Looks like Jesus has quite a bit to say about people who ignore commandments, in fact. But maybe it's just Matthew?  &gt;It is easier for heaven and earth to disappear than for the least stroke of a pen to drop out of the Law.  (Luke 16:17, NIV)  Okay, so Jesus is a bust. Let's see what the Epistles have to say about the Mosaic Code:  &gt; If you really keep the royal law found in Scripture, ‚ÄúLove your neighbor as yourself,‚Äù you are doing right.  But if you show favoritism, you sin and are convicted by the law as lawbreakers. For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it.   (James 2:8-10, NIV)  &gt;All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness,  (2 Timothy 3:16)  &gt;Do we, then, nullify the law by this faith? Not at all! Rather, we uphold the law.  (Romans 3:31)  Well, shit.   This problem disappears quite quickly if you assert that most of the Bible is hogwash, and you only care about the good parts. If you prefer to cling to it as an inspired document, vague mutterings about ""context"" or about Jesus abolishing the old Law won't get you anywhere. ",‚Ñ¢

We all have our crosses to bear, so to speak, so ignore those emotions - they don't help you and they aren't fully rational. (There are plenty of hideous women who don't sit back and get hundreds of messages.)  Also, personality is cultivated. Women who sit back and do nothing and have nothing interesting to say will have nothing interesting to say for their entire lives. Why would their temporary success frustrate you?  This will be long, since I'll just quote what you wrote and tear it apart. I'll use caps to differentiate (turning on and off style is annoying, sadly):   I'm not quite sure what I'm looking for here. But hey, here's a huge wall of text, if you're into that sort of things.  BAD BAD NEVER GO META. EVER. EVER EVER. NOBODY LIKES IT. EVER. AND ""BUT HEY, HERE'S A HUGE WALL OF EFFORT FOR YOU TO LIKE ME"" MAKES ABSOLUTELY NOBODY ATTRACTED TO YOU. THROW ALL THAT AWAY.  I'm currently working on a joint major in Physics and CompSci.  THIS SHOULD BE IN YOUR WHAT I'M DOING  I have many tiny hobbies, like photography, programming, digital image and video editing or music mixing. I never get especially good at any of them, but I try them all nonetheless.  TINY? WHAT ARE YOUR **PASSIONS**. THIS IS WHAT YOU SHOULD BE TALKING ABOUT. AND IF YOU LIKE PHOTOGRAPHY, MAKE JOKES OR FUNNY STATEMENTS ABOUT IT. DITTO EVERYTHING ELSE. AND DON'T EVER SAY YOU DON'T GET GOOD AT THINGS. **THROW THAT PART AWAY ASAP.**  I love reading about science, philosophy and psychology. Gaining knowledge in general is fun. I enjoy people who aren't ashamed of their intelligence and loving to learn more.  GOOD. ALL PASSIONS. CALL YOURSELF A NERD, SINCE YOU ARE. MAYBE EXPLORE DICHOTOMIES - YOU LIKE THIS, BUT YOU ALSO LIKE WRESTLING, OR THE KARDASHIANS, OR SOMETHING TERRIBLE. WE ALL LIKE SOMETHING TERRIBLE - ADMIT YOUR OWN VICES. IT'S AMUSING AND HUMANIZING.  I used to game a lot more in the past (CS1.6, TF2, L4D, MC, etc), but less so now. I still enjoy exploring short experimental indie games from time to time.  YOU ARE WRITING A MESSAGE TO A TINY, TINY NICHE OF PEOPLE SAYING THAT YOU NO LONGER DO THEIR ACTIVITY. THIS IS STUPID. VERY STUPID. THROW IT AWAY.  I'm not one to hang out in bars and clubs, but I enjoy trying new restaurants, shows and activities.  OK SAY WHY - HOW DO THEY MAKE YOU FEEL. WHAT DO YOU LOOK FOR. ANY AMUSING ANECDOTES?  I also love satire.  OK BUT THIS IS BLAND AND FACTUAL, AS IS EVERYTHING BEFORE IT. IF YOU **LOVE** SOMETHING, SAY SO! AND SAY WHAT, SPECIFICALLY. I WOULD OMIT THIS AND INCLUDE IT IN YOUR BOOKS SECTION, UNLESS YOU HAVE SOMETHING MORE TO SAY ABOUT IT HERE.  Things that get on my nerve: ""I love all music except country"" Bad kerning ""xD"" ""Disagree / Slightly Disagree / Neutral / Slightly Agree / Agree"" questionnaires  NO FUCK YOU NOTHING GETS ON YOUR NERVES, EVER. THROW THAT ALL AWAY. NEGATIVITY CAUSES PEOPLE TO HATE YOU AND RUN AWAY. OMIT ALL OF THIS.  next section (I hate writing in caps):  ‚òë Acquiring bacon flavored karma  FUNNY BUT NICHE. LOWER DOWN  ‚òë Exploiting a thesaurus  GOOD. YOU SHOULD DOUBLE WORD PLAY IT - EXPLOITING A THESAURUS... AND NOT CALLING IT AFTERWARD. OR ""AND THEN FEELING GUILTY AND TAKING IT ON A FEW DATES, WHICH THEN LEAD TO A FEW MONTH RELATIONSHIP, AND THEN THE THESAURUS CHEATS ON ME.""  THIS IS WHAT PLAYFUL MEANS. FOOLING AROUND.  ‚òë Showing someone they are wrong on the internet  **LOOK, WORLD, I'M A TREMENDOUS ASSHOLE!** THROW THAT OUT.  ‚òë Farming for hats  UH. OK. NICHE.  ‚òë Knowing my way around these series of tubes  STOP BEING SO NICHE OR YOU WILL NEVER ATTRACT THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE. NICHE IS FINE FOR SOULMATES, BUT THIS STATEMENT IS NOT FUNNY TO ANYONE, AS FAR AS I KNOW. THROW IT AWAY.  ‚òë Being meta as fuck  NOPE. AGAIN TOO THINKY. NO EMOTIONS. NOBODY LIKES META BUT A VERY VERY SMALL GROUP OF PEOPLE, AND EVEN THEY TIRE OF IT.  ‚òë Using Unicode checkmarked boxes  YES  ‚òê Not using Unicode uncheckmarked boxes  YES THAT WAS FUNNY. GOOD.  Awesome as fuck online, shy as fuck IRL. Story of my life. I do loosen rather quickly though, so no worries!  NO. YOU ARE NOT SOCIALLY HORRENDOUS. IF YOU ARE, FIX THAT. GET OFF OKC, OFF THE INTERNET FOR A FEW YEARS, AND LEARN TO TALK TO PEOPLE. WOMEN DON'T WANT SHY GUYS. YOU HAVE DISPLAYED SO LITTLE SO FAR IN THIS PROFILE THAT IS ATTRACTIVE. MAYBE THAT'S YOUR PROBLEM, EH?  I tend to write huge blocks of text and I make the lamest jokes. ""IT TAKES SO MUCH EFFORT TO COMMUNICATE WITH ME! HAHA!"" UH. NO. AGAIN, TERRIBLE. LOSE THIS AND DON'T DO THIS IN GENERAL.  I know I have a mau5head as my profile picture, but I'm not that big of a Deadmau5 fan. I like some of his older work, but making that head was mainly a fun little summer project of mine. Hipster, I know, shut up!  ...UH. MAKE THIS FUNNY. YOU HATE HIM BECAUSE HE SLEPT WITH YOUR SISTER. OR YOUR MOTHER. OR HIS SISTER SLEPT WITH YOUR SISTER. OR HE DID SOMETHING BAD TO YOU. OTHERWISE, THIS IS JUST ""HEY LOOK MORE NEGATIVITY!"" AND NOBODY WANTS THAT.   Books I haven't developed a taste in English literature yet since English has only became my primarily language a couple years ago, but I'm starting to build up a collection and will hopefully have favorites soon! Lame excuse, I know.  **THIS IS THE BEST THING YOU HAVE SAID SO FAR AND YOU NEED TO SAY THIS FAR EARLIER. WOMEN WILL THROW THEIR PANTIES AT FOREIGNERS, BECAUSE THEY LIKE NEW CULTURAL EXPERIENCES. PUT THIS AT THE TOP TOP TOP OF YOUR PROFILE!**  THE REST OF THIS SECTION IS ALWAYS BORING FOR EVERYONE SO I'LL OMIT IT. IT'S OK. YOUR FOOD SECTION IS FUNNY.  I keep getting nerd-sniped left and right, so I'm often found trying to solve problems, may it be about mathematics, programming, or whatever.  ""HEY I AM FULL OF FACTS AND NO EMOTIONS HAHA DATE ME PLEASE."" NO. WE KNOW THIS ALREADY. YOU NEED TO SHOW THAT YOU CAN EXPRESS EMOTIONS ABOUT THINGS AND BE PASSIONATE ABOUT THEM. DO THAT WAY MORE. STOP MAKING FUCKING EXCUSES FOR THE THINGS YOU LOVE AND START EXPRESSING THAT YOU LOVE THEM.  I love thinking about deep as fuck game ideas, such as ""A horror game where the enemies sneak up on you and shout Dubstep into your ears""  THIS IS VERY FUNNY. THIS SHOULD BE IN THE TOP OF YOUR PROFILE.  How to get the narwhals to throw up arrow shaped votes at me.  NO. NOBODY LIKES THIS.  On a typical Friday night I am 127.0.0.1, sweet 127.0.0.1  Wow that was horrible, please ignore that. If only there was some way for me to get rid of it...  IT IS HORRIBLE AND DON'T STATE THAT IT IS. LOSE THE SECOND PARAGRAPH AND JUST KEEP IT AND SEE IF ANYONE LIKES IT. IT'S VERY MILDLY CLEVER.   The most private thing I‚Äôm willing to admit I've never really been in a serious relationship.  ""HEY I HAVE NO EMOTIONS, I SUCK AT THINGS, IT TAKES EFFORT TO COMMUNICATE WITH ME, AND I WILL BE TERRIBLE WHEN DATING!"" REALLY? I MEAN, **REALLY?** THROW THAT AWAY AND NEVER, EVER LOOK BACK.  Not sure if this goes here but I used to play the violin for 5 years when I was younger. Wasn't passionate enough to continue down that road, but it was a great experience.  OK THAT WORKS.  THE REST:  ‚Ä¢ Want to share songs, movies or games back and forth  YAWN  ‚Ä¢ Need a gaming partner  OK  ‚Ä¢ Want to have a discussion about physics, computer science, philosophy or any other of the sciences.  SEE ENDING BELOW  ‚Ä¢ Have a mind-boggling puzzle that nerd-sniped you and want to join forces in order to solve it  I DON'T KNOW WHAT NERD-SNIPED MEANS, NOBODY ELSE DOES EITHER, AND THIS SUCKS. THROW IT OUT.  ‚Ä¢ Any question about anything in that huge block of text above  MEH.   Ok final thoughts: I'm going to be cruel here. All the women you want to be dating? They're dating me. And all the other guys who love science and computers and everything you love, except we're fun, because we can express ourselves. The hot nerdy girls STILL WANT a guy who can express his emotions. It's a weird, weird thing, but those women all lunge at the handful of men who aren't wrapped up in their heads. If you unwrap your emotions from their carefully constructed packaging and take them out and play with them and display them to others, WOMEN WILL LOVE YOU. Especially if you can play around and make them laugh. You can do this when you're talking to friends, but jesus, pretend the following: all of your friends don't know you, and the only way they know whether they want to meet you is by reading this profile. Would it work? Or would you change it?  You'd change it. So do so.  Final dirty statement: a lot of girls on okcupid have profiles that, in the absence of pictures, are far more interesting than yours. They express themselves and are interesting. So ""barely work on"" is meaningless. All that matters is how you communicate. So work on that!  There's your book. Now instead of asking for more advice, go fix what's broken. Evolve the damned thing until it works. And yes - smile. ",‚òë

t5_2qh2s,rbrumble,1334519558,"For you then:  ______  From Dragon 127, pg. 3  Tucker‚Äôs kobolds  This month‚Äôs editorial is about Tucker‚Äôs kobolds. We get letters on occasion asking for advice on creating high-level AD&amp;D¬Æ game adventures, and Tucker‚Äôs kobolds seem to fit the bill.  Many high-level characters have little to do because they‚Äôre not challenged. They yawn at tarrasques and must be forcibly kept awake when a lich appears. The DMs involved don‚Äôt know what to do, so they stop dealing with the problem and the characters go into Character Limbo. Getting to high level is hard, but doing anything once you get there is worse.  One of the key problems in adventure design lies in creating opponents who can challenge powerful characters. Singular monsters like tarrasques and liches are easy to gang up on; the party can concentrate its firepower on the target until the target falls down dead and wiggles its little feet in the air. Designing monsters more powerful than a tarrasque is self-defeating; if the group kills your super-monster, what will you do next‚Äîsend in its mother? That didn‚Äôt work on Beowulf, and it probably won‚Äôt work here.  Worse yet, singular supermonsters rarely have to think. They just use their trusty, predictable claw/claw/bite. This shouldn‚Äôt be the measure of a campaign. These games fall apart because there‚Äôs no challenge to them, no mental stimulation ‚Äì no danger.  In all the games that I‚Äôve seen, the worst, most horrible, most awful beyond-comparison opponents ever seen were often weaker than the characters who fought them. They were simply well-armed and intelligent beings who were played by the DM to be utterly ruthless and clever. Tucker‚Äôs kobolds were like that.  Tucker ran an incredibly dangerous dungeon in the days I was stationed at Ft. Bragg, N.C. This dungeon had corridors that changed all of your donkeys into huge flaming demons or dropped the whole party into acid baths, but the demons were wienies compared to the kobolds on Level One. These kobolds were just regular kobolds, with 1-4 hp and all that, but they were mean. When I say they were mean, I mean they were bad, Jim. They graduated magna cum laude from the Sauron Institute for the Criminally Vicious.  When I joined the gaming group, some of the PCs had already met Tucker‚Äôs kobolds, and they were not eager to repeat the experience. The party leader went over the penciled map of the dungeon and tried to find ways to avoid the little critters, but it was not possible. The group resigned itself to making a run for it through Level One to get to the elevators, where we could go down to Level Ten and fight ‚Äúokay‚Äù monsters like huge flaming demons.  It didn‚Äôt work. The kobolds caught us about 60‚Ä≤ into the dungeon and locked the door behind us and barred it. Then they set the corridor on fire, while we were still in it.  ‚ÄúNOOOOOO!!!‚Äù screamed the party leader. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs THEM! Run!!!‚Äù  Thus encouraged, our party scrambled down a side passage, only to be ambushed by more kobolds firing with light crossbows through murder holes in the walls and ceilings. Kobolds with metal armor and shields flung Molotov cocktails at us from the other sides of huge piles of flaming debris, which other kobolds pushed ahead of their formation using long metal poles like broomsticks. There was no mistake about it. These kobolds were bad.  We turned to our group leader for advice.  ‚ÄúAAAAAAGH!!!‚Äù he cried, hands clasped over his face to shut out the tactical situation.  We abandoned most of our carried items and donkeys to speed our flight toward the elevators, but we were cut off by kobold snipers who could split-move and fire, ducking back behind stones and corners after launching steel-tipped bolts and arrows, javelins, hand axes, and more flaming oil bottles. We ran into an unexplored section of Level One, taking damage all the time. It was then we discovered that these kobolds had honeycombed the first level with small tunnels to speed their movements. Kobold commandos were everywhere. All of our hirelings died. Most of our henchmen followed. We were next.  I recall we had a 12th-level magic user with us, and we asked him to throw a spell or something. ‚ÄúBlast ‚Äòem!‚Äù we yelled as we ran. ‚ÄúFireball ‚Äòem! Get those little @#+$%*&amp;!!‚Äù  ‚ÄúWhat, in these narrow corridors? ‚Äù he yelled back. ‚ÄúYou want I should burn us all up instead of them?‚Äù  Our panicked flight suddenly took us to a dead-end corridor, where a giant air shaft dropped straight down into unspeakable darkness, far past Level Ten. Here we hastily pounded spikes into the floors and walls, flung ropes over the ledge, and climbed straight down into that unspeakable darkness, because anything we met down there was sure to be better than those kobolds.  We escaped, met some huge flaming demons on Level Ten, and even managed to kill one after about an hour of combat and the lives of half the group. We felt pretty good ‚Äî but the group leader could not be cheered up.  ‚ÄúWe still have to go out the way we came in,‚Äù he said as he gloomily prepared to divide up the treasure.  Tucker‚Äôs kobolds were the worst things we could imagine. They ate all our donkeys and took our treasure and did everything they could to make us miserable, but they had style and brains and tenacity and courage. We respected them and loved them, sort of, because they were never boring.  If kobolds could do this to a group of PCs from 6th to 12th level, picture what a few orcs and some low level NPCs could do to a 12th-16th level group, or a gang of mid-level NPCs and monsters to groups of up to 20th level. Then give it a try. Sometimes, it‚Äôs the little things‚Äîused well‚Äîthat count.  Roger E. Moore ",¬Æ

If there were no ads they would need to charge a lot more for the licensing of the content (note current shows are 2$+ AN EPISODE on iTunes and there are no current shows on Netflix at the $7.99/month rate). If you read the HuluPlus FAQ you would know what you are getting, here is the first entry:  ""1. What do I get with my Hulu Plus subscription?  Hulu Plus‚Ñ¢ lets you watch hit current and back season TV shows and acclaimed movies anytime in HD for $7.99/month **with limited advertising**. We think of it as a complement to the free service on Hulu.com. For many popular shows on our service, Hulu Plus offers every episode of the current season, not just a handful of recent episodes. Hulu Plus subscribers also have access to back seasons and full runs of some of TV's greatest shows, including many that were not available online before. ...""

One of the jewels of my Spider-Man collection.  Secret Wars #1 came out the same month. Though some major characters with their own titles weren't in the Secret Wars (I don't think Daredevil was, for example), basically, every April issue of almost all the Marvel comics in 1984 ended the same way: hero(es) is alerted to something weird in Central Park, investigates, finds giant metal space doughnut with 4 big open 'garages', approaches a garage and POP! Gone. And following, most of the May issues dealt a bit with people and the press wondering ""where have the heroes gone"", then POP! Our main character returns, but there's something NEW or DIFFERENT!  To be honest, by the time the 12 issues had played out, we were all pretty tired of it. Jim Shooter was never the most inspired writer, and I personally never really cared for Mike Zeck as an artist. Plus it turned out to be one of those comic 'events' that existed for no other reason than ""Hey! Let's have an Event‚Ñ¢!"" (i.e. $$.) Sure, it explained all the stuff that suddenly happened in May of '84, it just turned out that most of the explanations weren't all that interesting.

t5_2qk68,TheLastBoyScout,1334546955,"Congrats on hitting metal. It always keeps you coming back for more and trying that much harder when things like this happen.    The Blizzard discs for me really don't give me that much more distance around 150 gram weights. The Blizzard Bosses are what I have found to be the most reliable, and around the 130 gram range. However, unless you are in a distance competition, i wouldnt recommend throwing them, as they are very movable and unpredictable at times.    What I throw really depends on a few things and what purpose my disc has for being in the bag.... I throw a mix of Champ and Star for most of my drivers, and typically i try to choose Champion plastic for my Overstable version of a mold, if I can find one with the right qualities that Im looking for, but more on that in a minute.    Well, Let me run down what plastics are and order of durability from most durable to least durable:  **‚ô†** CE/Titanium (CE was just a tough plastic that was resistant to scuffing. Titanium is a polymer blend to add durability)   **‚ô†** Champion/Elite Z   **‚ô†** Star/ESP (a blend of Champion/Elite Z and Pro/Elite X for added grip)   **‚ô†** KC Pro   **‚ô†** Pro/R-Pro/Elite X   **‚ô†** DX/Pro D    Typically, the stiffer the plastic, the more resistant to scuffing it will be, and thus more durable.    Now, one thing that I hear commonly is that Champion plastic is more stable than Star or Pro. While one would assume this is true, its really not if you were to compare the discs as they were brand new.   Lets take a Roc for example. A DX Roc is by and far the most stable Roc you can get off the shelf, but because they break in the quickest people usually tend to go with Champion or Star over the DX. So, for extended durability in the long run, they give up DX which has more glide. If we invert the chart above (reading it from bottom to top) you get a list of discs that have the most glide to the least amount of glide. This is one factor that causes people to believe that a disc is more stable, simply because it didnt go as far. If you were able to throw a DX Roc, a KC Pro Roc, a Star Roc and a Champion Roc (which for the sake of this argument all have the same exact specs, weights, and dimensions and are all from the Rancho mold) on a flat trajectory, you would have to watch how quickly the disc goes from flat and to a hyzer angle to truly measure stability.     Like i said, its all hypothetical since Champion and Star plastics tends to mold up with a thicker wing. This combination of being slightly thicker and having less glide usually means it will be more likely to fade when you need it to, making it more reliable, and thus preferred.    Now one thing that you have to be aware of is that for some reason, and I haven't figured out why nor had anyone else offer me an explanation, certain molds are more stable in Champion plastic than they are in Star and vice versa. Champion Sidewinders are less stable than Star Sidewinders, while Champion Roadrunners are more stable than Star Roadrunners. So knowing what type of plastic works best for the disc you are throwing is important as well. The same thing applies to a Glow disc. The Glow material seems to not only make a stiffer disc, but it tends to mold up flatter. Im guessing something about the glow material allows the disc's flight plate to cool slightly faster than the rim. This causes it to appear flatter, which means its more low speed stable, and the flight plate shrinking first means it pulls the parting line of the disc up higher. Here is a good article that Blake T wrote that gave me the basic ins and outs on what to look for years ago when i first started the game: [http://www.discgolfreview.com/resources/articles/discqualities.shtml](http://www.discgolfreview.com/resources/articles/discqualities.shtml)      The one last piece of advice I can give about looking at a disc before buying it, is something i mentioned about Glow discs and the parting line: [http://i.imgur.com/6vDPw.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/6vDPw.jpg). This is a little thing i put together a few months ago and posted. This will help you find like discs no matter what production run they are from, or what plastic they are in. With how a disc cools affecting how the final product comes out, it can make it very hard to grab discs that fly the same within the same mold and plastic you prefer. Knowing the specific parting line heights and how much of a hook they have will save you lots of time and effort when trying to find backups and replacements. The higher the parting line and the deeper the hook, the more overstable the disc will be regardless of the plastic.  ",‚ô†

Two other prototypes were produced by Ford and Willys-Overland. The Army felt that the American Bantam Car Company was too small to supply the number of vehicles needed and it then allowed Ford and Willys-Overland to make attempts on their designs after seeing Bantam's vehicle in working order. Willys-Overland offered the lowest bid and won the initial contract. Willys-Overland now had what would become the standardized jeep design.

t5_2qk68,TheLastBoyScout,1334589261,"My Thoughts:      **‚ô†** Dave D's Tip is one of the most important in putting. He is right, everything else is *SECONDARY* to making that quick last second movement.      **‚ô†** Avery's point about putter choice: That it feels good in your hand, and makes you putt with confidence. This game is 95% mental. And 100% of that mental aspect is being *CONFIDENT* in your self and your abilities.      **‚ô†** Avery talks about there being minimal wrist spring. Most people mistake the finger spring for being wrist spring. Wrist spring + finger spring = being off line to the right of your line (assuming RH putting).      **‚ô†** Avery talks about focusing on one link when aiming, or the basket as a whole. I disagree with this. I like what Cam Todd says on this matter. He feels that you should always aim at the pole. Its solid, and its always in the center of the basket regardless where you are. Moving around the basket the location of the chain links always change, so you are never aim in the same exact location, just a general on.      **‚ô†** Jussi's remarks about putting in the wind. Spot on.      **‚ô†** The 3 Points of Putting: **1)** Routine. A good routine will help you overcome many distractions, including pressure situations. If you have made the putt 1000s of times in practice, then making the same putt to win really is no different. It's still the same putt. **2)** Commit and Execute. Another duh moment, but still something people struggle with. As Avery said, you have to be confident in knowing you are making the right choice in your plan of attack. If you aren't feeling it, step off the putt, take a deep breath and fully exhale, then set back up and make the putt. **3)** Practice is almost a given. If you don't put in the time, you'll never see any benefits.         I would say that over all its a decent video. Its mainly for players who have been playing for a while and doesn't go in to as much depth as Dave Feldberg does in some of his videos, but it does make some good points that would benefit any one.",‚ô†

He feels that you should always aim at the pole. Its solid, and its always in the center of the basket regardless where you are. Moving around the basket the location of the chain links always change, so you are never aim in the same exact location, just a general on.  My inexperienced logic on the matter, from a purely geometrical standpoint. You have to take in to consideration the degree of variance. Say you have a 10-15 degree variance in your putts, at 10 feet you're off by inches, but by the time you're out to 40 feet, your range of variance is wider than the chains. Taking fade into consideration at that distance; shouldn't you be aiming towards the edge of the chains, or are you just trying to have enough speed on it to keep it from fading?",‚ô†

Rather than just right-clicking at and selecting ""save image as"", you need to use the download link on the deviantart page. That'll give you a .zip folder with the .bmps inside it. I guess I may as well walk you through the rest, just in case. If you don't already have a rar extractor like winrar or something, I'm pretty sure you'll need to get one of those to get inside that zip folder. If you don't have one just google it and you'll fins one pretty quickly.  In the zip folder there are two other folders which contain different versions of the animation, one of which is stretched for some reason. You'll need to extract one of these (just drag it from the extractor window to your desktop or somewhere in your documents) to use with the [boot updater](http://www.coderforlife.com/projects/win7boot/). Assuming you've downloaded that, just run the .exe  and in the first drop-down in the window, select ""animation"". From there, just find the folder you extracted and the rest should be pretty self-explanatory. ninja edit: you can also change the text on the loading screen to, like, ""loading sburb, ¬©Crockercorp"" or whatever.

Murder, theft, etc are all things that harm another person. So the question is, would showing such affection harm someone? This is for you to decide, and for her to decide for herself. Paul's epistles should account for social context, though the bottom line is the above, be excellent to each other. Taking what we know about psychology and modern relationships between people, that message may have been worded differently to us.

t5_2qgzg,Buckethats,1334666928,"Seven Changes I Made to Change My Life  How to Network Your Life Into Profits   By Richard Ravarino  My buddy Randy tried to pound this one into my head over the last four years, but I am stubborn (and he can be an ass at times), so it took some dogged determination on his end (and a long look in the mirror (for me) to finally get the point across). He told me, ‚ÄúTo get the things you have never had, you have to be willing to do things you have never done"". For that, I thank him.  To him that meant working like a slave, making next to nothing - Until the big payoff. Many times, I truly am too stubborn to listen, but if you have ever had an over-bearing boss that really has the ability to get under your skin and push your buttons, it some times takes a parting of ways for principles that he tried to instill in you, to sink in.  Once they finally did, I got hungry. I got pissed off, and I started to make the changes that he would have like to have seen, while he was still signing my checks. Too often people want success, but they are not observing themselves from an outside view, if we could only gain that perspective and step outside of our own heads, we could see why we often send ourselves running in circles.  In the following paragraphs I am going to do my best, to flush out my own shortcomings and explain to you the small, but significant adjustments I made, to put myself on a winning course. There were seven of these adjustments I made, which cumulatively set me on a fresh course (in all honesty, it fixed my spinning compass and put me on a course that is finally navigable). I‚Äôm not where I want to be yet, but my boat is finally well keeled and my compass is reading true, with the wind at my back, I will happily share these nuggets of wisdom.  So what kind of adjustments did I make?  #1. Sleep became a luxury. Real toil - Real work getting done was what made the difference. I had to put all the crap going on in my life (and the world), completely out of my head. Politics? Yeah, you guys know I‚Äôm a ‚Äúdied-in-the-wool‚Äù Conservative Libertarian, but where was it getting me? I was becoming a negative Nelly. I bitched and I moaned on a daily basis and things only got worse.  Gee, I wonder why?  Think about that. Look there is no magic pill for success. If you want it, you have to show the world you want it and you have to reach for it. I doubt there was more than a weekend or two that I disengaged and tried to relax ‚Äì Truthfully, old habits die-hard. I didn‚Äôt want to fall back into my old habits, so even those ‚Äúrelaxing weekends‚Äù; I ended up talking shop with the people I‚Äôd meet.  #2 Turn off the boob tube. TV is a waste of your time! ""But what about the news?!?"" Network news? Do you enjoy being lied to? Things suck out there. . . They are bad and getting worse, regardless of how they spin it. Do you need that negativity in your life? Not right now, you don't! Let me tell you something, there is nothing so important that is going to be aired as the story of your financial freedom and that story will never be told, while you are sitting around watching for it on TV.  Nowadays, I barely watch anything. If I were going to enjoy a sports event, I‚Äôd rather do it in person. . . Or even at a busy sports bar among friends. You are wasting your time in front of the television. Turn it off. Focus on what‚Äôs going to make you money! By the way, one caveat. . . I do still watch American Idol.  After being a karaoke DJ for 15 years, I feel like I could be there on the bench with JLo, Steven and Randy. It‚Äôs my one guilty pleasure and no one is perfect. But that‚Äôs 2-3 hours per week and 2.5 days over a season. That‚Äôs like I threw away a three day weekend ‚Äì poof! Gone! All because I was vegging in front of the idiot box. Just trying to putting things in perspective. . .That and I don‚Äôt want to be called a hypocrite when somebody calls me on it. I love my IDOL! Go Colton!!! ‚ò∫  #3 ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get pizza and go to a game?‚Äù ‚ÄúDude! Let‚Äôs go check out that new club!‚Äù ‚ÄúHey, come grab a beer with me, man!‚Äù  You MUST ignore any and all attempts to get you distracted. This is a big one! Just one month into building my business, I was feeling some measure of success and for some reason, people knew it! My phone was ringing and people wanted me to do stuff ‚Äì Hell, I wanted to do stuff! Don‚Äôt do it! Once again, I bring up my buddy Randy, love him (and hate him), he pounded this point into me, ‚ÄúFOCUS!‚Äù  I know that sounds harsh, we all want to have a little fun in life, but once again, we are not trying to change our income level by a few insubstantial dollars,  we are trying to change our lives! Don‚Äôt lose focus! The time will come and if you don‚Äôt compromise, it will be amazing!  #4 Be a positive influence on everyone around you and if you surround yourself with negative people ‚Äì find new friends! I mean that in all sincerity. You have heard the analogy of people closest to you, being like fellow crabs in a pot? The harder you try and escape, the more they will cling on to you, assuring that you never leave their ‚Äúloving‚Äù grasp.  Just say no.  If you have to completely remove them from your life. . .  Just do it.  Until you can create the new patterns of success in your life, which elevate you beyond their grasp they will just bring you down. Later, once you‚Äôve made it (and you‚Äôll know you have made it, when someone you respect tells you ‚Äúits okay to take your foot off the gas ‚Äì enjoy it now!‚Äù. At that point, if there are any of them you still hold hope for, reach out and extend a welcome hand. Feel free to pull them out of the mire, once you are immune to their insanity (but only then).  #5 Let me be clear here. There is no magic BB in this business. The ‚Äúperfect‚Äù path for us all to follow. The methods of success, they are as varied as the fish in the sea. One guy will make it doing meetings or webinars. Some people are naturals on the phone, attracting prospect after prospect with the velvet sounds of their voice. I‚Äôm a social networking guy myself ‚Äì Everyone has their thing they are good at. Do some research and find yours. My point is, this isn‚Äôt the 1970‚Äôs anymore and there are far more sophisticated options that just, ‚Äúyour list‚Äù.  #6 Buy a self-improvement course. Subscribe to Success Magazine. LISTEN to what other powerful industry leaders have done to change their lives. Draw on that inspiration! Author Antony Robbins started these kinds of conversations a generation ago, with his Absolute Power series. They are everywhere, make use of them! They will put you in a mindset to be successful. Don‚Äôt be afraid to ‚Äúfake it, until you make it‚Äù!  #7 This kind of dovetails into the last point, but don‚Äôt be afraid to invest in yourself. Get away from trying to do everything on a budget, or even worse, for free. The information you get, is often worth what you pay for it. Think about what I just said, maybe even re-read the first part of this paragraph.  Buy quality.  The recordings are only going to get you so far. At some point, you are going to need one on one, interactive coaching with a warm body ‚Äì at the very least, pay for one of these gurus systems. It will change your fortunes. Most of the times, ‚ÄúFree‚Äù is the most expensive way you can learn something.  If you enjoyed this post please comment and share",‚ò∫

t5_2qi86,w0lrah,1334691936,"I found a bit more information [here](http://www.arnewsline.org/storage/scripts/nsln1809.txt).  &gt;ENFORCEMENT: FCC ISSUES NOTICE OF VIOLATION TO ATV REPEATER OPERATOR &gt; &gt;The FCC has issued a Notice of Violation to a California ham for interfering with FAA radiolocation operations. It also claims he was broadcasting television signals in the 23 centimeter band. But it now appears as if these charges are not what the regulatory agency might want us to believe. Amateur Radio Newsline‚Äôs Bill Pasternak, WA6ITF, is in the newsroom with more: &gt; &gt;Gary Dent, AF6HP, has operated 1 point 2 GHz fast scan amateur television repeaters and beacons for about the past 10 years. One of these was located at the Sunset Ridge radio site 40 miles North East of the city of Los Angeles, California. &gt; &gt;Dent tells Newsline that in February he received a phone call from a person identifying himself as an agent of the FCC‚Äôs Cerritos California office. The agent told Dent that his AF6HP system on Sunset Ridge was interfering with some newly installed radar system. Dent tells Newsline that he immediately functioned the system off the air and told the agent he would remove the hardware from the hill as soon as road access made it accessible. &gt; &gt;According to Dent a few weeks later he received another call from the same agent informing him that he was again transmitting from the Sunset Ridge location and was to cease these transmissions immediately. &gt; &gt;Dent says that he can only assume that one of the power failures that took place during a severe weather outbreak reset the controller putting the system back on the air in beacon mode. Beacon operation is legal under Section 97.203 of the Amateur Part 97 Rules. &gt; &gt;Wanting to comply with the FCC‚Äôs request he immediately verified the situation; again remotely turned off the system and has since removed the gear from the site. &gt; &gt;Case closed you would assume? Well if you do you are wrong. &gt; &gt;On March 30th the FCC‚Äôs District Director of the Los Angeles Office Western Region Enforcement Bureau issued a two prong Notice of Violation to AF6HP. It charges that on February 29, March 2nd, and March 22nd that, in response to an interference complaint from Federal Aviation Administration, an agent of the Enforcement Bureau's Los Angeles Office used direction finding and other investigative techniques to identify transmissions in the 23 cm band. He found them coming from Station AF6HP. &gt; &gt;The Notice of Violation says that the agent observed violations of 97.303(b) which is the interference issue. He also charged Dent with broadcasting under Section 97.113(b). The latter is curious in that AF6HP says that when the system came back on that it was in its default beacon mode. As already noted, beacon operation is legally authorized under FCC Rule 97.203(b). However Section F of the same rule states that a beacon must cease transmissions upon notification by a District Director that the station is operating improperly or causing undue interference to other operations. The beacon may not resume transmitting without prior approval of the District Director. But nowhere in Section 97.203 is the term broadcasting applied to beacon operation. &gt; &gt;Where this matter goes in relation to AF6HP is now up to the FCC. The offending equipment was removed and Dent tells Newsline that it will eventually be re-installed at another site that hopefully will not interfere with FAA or any other radio systems serving the Los Angeles or Riverside areas. &gt; &gt;For the Amateur radio Newsline, I‚Äôm Bill Pasternak, WA6ITF, in the newsroom in Los Angeles. &gt; &gt;We will definitely keep you posted on this one. (FCC, ARNewsline‚Ñ¢)   tl;dr version: It's an ATV repeater that had been running for years.  It was remotely shut down when the FCC notified the operator that it was interfering with the new radar, with the intent of being removed when weather allowed access.  Somehow a few weeks later it was turned back on (assumed to be due to a power failure resetting equipment) and it defaulted to a beacon mode.  It was shut down again once this was noticed and the equipment was removed, but for some reason the FCC has continued to pursue action.  Obviously we haven't heard the FCC's side of the story, but it'll be interesting to see how it plays out.",‚Ñ¢

Bleach + acid = chlorine gas, ~~AKA mustard gas.~~ Derp  &gt;What Happens When Bleach and Vinegar Are Mixed  &gt;Chlorine bleach contains sodium hypochlorite or NaOCl. Because bleach is sodium hypochlorite in water, the sodium hypochlorite in bleach actually exists as hypochlorous acid:  &gt;NaOCl + H2O ‚Üî HOCl + Na+ + OH-  &gt;Hypochlorous acid is a strong oxidizer. This is what makes it so good at bleaching and disinfection. If you mix bleach with an acid, chlorine gas will be produced. For example, if you mix bleach with toilet bowl cleaner, which contains hydrochloric acid:  &gt;HOCl + HCl ‚Üî H2O + Cl2  &gt;Chlorine gas attacks mucous membranes, such as your eyes, throat, and lungs and can kill you, so causing that reaction isn't in your best interest.

Dell XPS doesn't get the same performance as the Alienware, until you get to 17 inch computers. That's to be expected since Dell owns Alienware.  Asus doesn't list prices online.

TOSHIBA [QOSMIO](http://www.mytoshiba.com.au/products/computers/qosmio/f750/pqf75a-065024/specifications#details) is above $2000, and has a worse GPU. It's also larger at 15+ inches.

Weilding box and bat in hand; To each roommate, a small demand, ""Go outside with me, I have a plan to make us bored no more."" Quoth the roommates, ""What's in the box?""  ""Are those what I think they are?"" ""Yes."" ""LET'S DO THIS! HELL FUCK YEAR!"" With a paintball mask in tow we headed out our backyard door.

Quoth the roommates, ""FIRE AWAY!!!""  ----------  As I sit and ponder back, I question if those trees were whack. But we all knew the risks when we decided to partake.  One roommate's hair was lit aflame. Another said I was to blame For being chased around the yard by sticks screaming their phosphor wake. Quoth the roommates, ""WHY DID WE AGREE TO THIS!?""

These toxic butterflies also employ colorful patterns (typically orange and red) on their wings, in order to deter predators that might eat them. Of the many beautiful butterfly species that use this type of defense mechanism, not one has ever been found to be impervious to bombs.  In the 1945 bombing of Hiroshima, 70,000 people were immediately killed by the blast from the nuclear explosion. Only 43,000 butterflies were killed.  The most powerful nuclear bomb ever constructed, called the Tzar-Bomb, weighed over 27 tonnes. If you were to gather enough butterflies together to equal the weight of this bomb, you would then have 90,000,000 butterflies. All of them would die if the Tzar-Bomb was dropped on them.    **This has been your daily Bombs and Butterflies Daily Fact fact-bomb. Enjoy more fun facts tomorrow!**   ",‚Ñ¢

It's a 12.5"" tablet/ultrabook hybrid with USB 3.0 and HDMI. Oh, and Windows 8. Most importantly, it's not running some ARM chip and an ARM-based OS; it's a full Ivy Bridge chipset, so it's a *full* desktop computer. For less-than $1000.   Intel's new pricing structure behind normal ultrabooks put them in [direct pricing competition with tablets](http://www.theverge.com/2012/4/11/2940525/intel-ultrabook-price-699-75-new-designs). $700 as a base price.   Let me predict what's going to happen in the next year. Microsoft isn't targeting tablets with Windows 8; they're targeting tablet/ultrabook hybrids. Microsoft and Intel will do an advertising blitz for Windows 8. They'll call the other tablets ""toys"" that people play games on. Impossible to do actual work with. They'll highlight the small screens, lack of keyboard, low-power chips, and the novel operating systems.   Bring Windows 8 on the screen. Lots of pretty, solid colors. Very hip. They'll use some tag-line like ""The best of both worlds"". It's got the ""most revolutionary"" touch-screen UI, but it also has Windows in the background for when you need to do work. There will be a shot of a woman cooking, using her tablet as a cookbook; then, she needs to use it to write an email, so she'll dock it with a keyboard. Another shot of a student, taking notes in class; suddenly he's back in the dorm room, writing a paper in **Microsoft Office**. End it with a classic *Intel Inside*‚Ñ¢ line; the Intel name is an incredibly powerful advertising tool, because its a brand that consumers are familiar with, and associate with high-technology.   People already sort-of associate tablets with toys. Apple constantly advertises features like Facetime and that Air Gamblers Super Jet-Fighter Extreme game. Advertising your product in that way is great for quick sales, because it creates emotional appeal. But Microsoft is going to aim for a more professional side of every consumer; the side that *needs* to do work, like writing emails, code, documents, movie editing, picture editing, etc etc. And by doing so, they'll place Windows 8 in a totally different category than iOS/Android. Consumers buy iPads because they want to, but they buy Windows 8 because they need to.  Again, its a play for the long-term. ",‚Ñ¢

In 50 years (probably sooner), few if any people will drive cars, be they ICE or electric or hydrogen.  Cars simply won't be part of the conversation (any more than horse-drawn carriages are today).  It will **have to be** about trains and subways OR it will be about horse-drawn carriages AGAIN.  Those are the real choices dictated by reality.  There is simply no way the physics of energy and the limits of natural resources on this planet will allow anything but these (or allow cars/suburbia to survive).    The only viable and scalable transportation scheme are electric trains (slow or high speed; intercity or subway/MRT/LRT).  Similarly suburbs *will be supplanted* by exactly the same energy and efficiency reasons.  You can't argue without denying the laws of physics themselves.  It's that simple.    These technologies and organizational geographics are 1) off the shelf and well established so they are the cheapest solution, 2) they are far more compatible with alternative energy sources while being transitionally compatible with oil/gas/nuclear, and 3) they scale and can increase transportation efficiency in double digits while cars and suburbs can not.  So the question really is only a strategy question: keep your head in the sand until it's too late to change and everything goes to hell - the result being the US reverts to an 18th century quality of life, or embrace change and start altering energy consumption patterns to match what energy supply dictates so the US can maintain a semblance of a 20th/21st century lifestyle that is necessarily a bit different than expected or what has come before (and which has been **proven** in Europe and Asia already).    Simply patching things over will hybrids or electric cars on the same geographic map **will not work**.  The other very fundamental point missing from the article entirely (which reads like a Boomer who thinks he'll live forever in a static world) is that Boomers will die out.  The Boomer love of cars *has already been dying out because it has not ""taken""* in Millennials.  This  is a Good Thing‚Ñ¢, as is their preference (even if partially dictated by economics) for more centralized urban living.  The efficiencies allow progress (even evolutionary, sustainable progress) rather than dictate devolution as perpetuating the status quo absolutely will.

Biggest irritation factor with this is that while your ammo capacity was limited as all hell, they placed the Magic Box of Ammunition‚Ñ¢ fucking **everywhere**. There was no concern of running out of ammo, you just had to fucking camp the ammo box *because you couldn't hold enough to kill anything.* * Inability to hold more than 2 guns. Another crippling factor caused by the ""modernized"" FPS genre. It was extremely boring to be limited in number of guns and when the expansion patched it so you could hold 4 guns, the gameplay improved *significantly* but it could still have been better by just not limiting you at all. * Not enough enemies. This is Duke Nukem. He's supposed to mow down hordes of pig cops and all other sorts of crazy shit. Why is everything attacking single file?

I think it'd be best done as hybrid space/ground, similar to Empire at War but with realtime interaction between the two ""layers."" Multiple simultaneous fronts (Sins of a Solar Empire, anyone?) would be intriguing, but possibly too chaotic unless it went the turn-based route.  &gt;I'd definitely want multiple campaigns. A Systems Alliance campaign could start with the fall of Earth and the ensuing guerrilla war, with lots of time sensitive hit-and-run missions and a limited supply of forces. After a certain point, the player's POV would switch from Anderson to Hackett, where you're commanding the Alliance military as a whole. A finite supply of fleet resources would be a nice story-driven gameplay element, and if it was handled similarly to Homeworld 2 I'd be all for it.  &gt;The turians started off with a sizable military, but were caught off guard almost as badly as the humans. A turian campaign could consist of fighting on and around Palaven and Menae. We saw slightly more of that conflict than we did Anderson and Hackett's adventures over the course of ME3, but there's a lot left to be explored.  &gt;The asari would make for a nice third campaign, starting you off on slightly stronger ground than the turians or humans, but with less of a standing military than either. I envision it as a long slog of a defensive war, even more so than the fight on Palaven or Earth. Constantly falling back with a last stand on Thessia, that sort of thing.  &gt;After all three of these campaigns are completed, the fourth campaign becomes available: the fight to retake Earth. You'd once more take on the role of Hackett, with command over all of the fleets.  &gt;It'd tie into your ME1/2/3 save files, and all the choices you made throughout the games would have just as much of an effect on the RTS as they did on ME3's story. Depending on your actions, krogans would assist your troops on Palaven, STG units would become available, the Destiny Ascension would be a player-controlled unit in the battle for Earth... Maybe we'd even see some rachni in action this time around.  &gt;EDIT: Another campaign that'd work? The quarians fighting their way into the Perseus Veil, with the end of the campaign occurring just as they push the geth back to Rannoch. Their involvement, along with the geth's, would also be determined by player choice.  &gt;EDIT 2: Oh, and no matter what choices you make in the game and how well you do, you still get whatever Space Magic‚Ñ¢ your character got at the end of ME3.",‚Ñ¢

(Besides the perfectly worthy goal of learning, of course)  You might make different choices if your goal is to make money, vs preserve what you have, for example. Perhaps you want to keep half your money very safe and risk the other half trying to get some return. Knowing your goals is extremely important in investing.  What duration are you thinking about? If you might want the money in 1 year, or 5 years, or 10 years, that affects your choices.  In general, the sooner you might want the money, the less risky asset you want. Government insured savings accounts, certificates of deposit, and government (US or Canadian) bonds are less risky, where 1 year CDs and bonds are lower risk (and lower interest rate) than 5 year CDs and bonds.

Most of these guys have long range fire, and concentrated fire can still bring you to your knees quickly.  *Special note: All of the above can be Barrier lifted once shields are down, or if they have no shields. Swarmers will die instantly.*  **Psuedo-Squish**: ****  * Combat Engineer * Guardian * Geth Pyro * Geth Prime (This is a heavy hitter, but wait) * Ravager  These guys aren't as difficult as our bosses (even though the Prime is here), but still require caution.  **The Engineers** are here, because of one thing: Turrets.  They can bring any player, even a player full specced damage resistance, to 0 health in seconds.  I would recommend attacking these guys from a distance if at all possible.  That way, if a Turret [*magically*](http://i.imgur.com/Wnn1y.gif) falls off of an Engineer upon death, you can get into cover.  **Pyros** should be dealt with the same way.  You can handle one, maybe two at a time, safely. More than that, not so much.  I like to Biotic Charge, and back pedal. While you back pedal, they should still be in their 'reeling stun' animation, and you can unload your shotgun/weapon into them. Rinse, and repeat.  If it's one Pyro, go for the Charge-&gt;Heavy Melee/Melee+Melee Combo.  **Guardians** I've covered with Barrier Pops. Pop that Barrier, shoot them in the face. But they're here because they can get tricky if they show up in a large group, and they won't be easy to single out with a lot of enemies around you. Make a ~~hasty retreat~~ Strategic Advance to the Rear, and kill the faster troops first, and wait for the Guardians to come to you.  **Primes** aren't as bad as the other bosses. And I list them here for the simple fact that they don't have a OHKO move. This makes them miles ahead easier.  You should still concentrate fire in your group.  **BUT**; if you have a large force advancing on you, someone should take the Primes off of your teammates. And that is *you*. Your job is to rush those Primes, and Charge, Heavy Melee, Shotgun+Backpedal, Rinse and Repeat (**ALWAYS REPEAT**).  And Charge takes priority over Melee/Shotgun. If you can Charge, **DO IT**.  You need to get your shields back ASAP.  **Ravagers** are the same strategy as Primes.  I need to do more testing with Barrier Pops, but Barrier might have a good Armor Piercing effect to it.  Like I said, I'll test it out.  But it's great for ruining a Swarmers day.   **We're gonna need a bigger boat...**: **** * Banshee * Brute * Atlas * Turret * Phantom  **Banshees**: ... ***We pray***...  **Brutes** are still a bit scary.  I would say attack from the rear, if at all possible.  Avoid attacking from the front, as that's grab/ganking range.  But use the Combo (Charge-&gt;Heavy Melee-&gt;Shotgun+BackPedal-&gt;Rinse &amp; Repeat (This shall be mentioned in the guide now as The Combo)).  If the Brute turns and looks at you, DO NOT CHARGE. That is the fast track to dying.  Shotgun first, avoid melee and Charge unless you have to.  **Atlases** are the same way.  Try attacking from the rear, but you can usually do The Combo on Atlases without fear.  The thing is, Atlases stagger easily from Charges, so you can backpedal right after a Charge.  I would change up The Combo into Charge-&gt;Shotgun Retreat-&gt;Rinse Repeat for Atlas.  **Banshees** really are the worst of the worst (come on, you didn't think I would leave you hanging, would I?).  Stay behind them, and Charge only if you need to. Avoid the front at all costs. Shoot only if they have you in their sights.  If they start warping, backpedal/run.  There's nothing cowardly about running from a Banshee. Those bitches be scary.  **Phantoms** aren't that bad since we have Barrier, and they mess up their day. But too many Phantoms can make something go wrong quickly. Barrier to Heavy Melee works, but I prefer Barrier to Shotgun in your face.  Charge *can* stagger Phantoms, but Barrier is more reliable. And Charge gets you right in their OHKO zone. And that's why they made this list.  **** &gt;**What do we bring on our Picnic?** ****  Let's go over EQ, especially with the new consumables that just came out with the Resurgance Pack. ****  **Strength Enhancer**:  This attachment increases your Melee Damage. Your first thought is probably, [Oh **FUCK YEAH**](http://i.imgur.com/5tKcK.gif).  Hold that thought.  While this makes you pretty damn awesome when dealing damage with your face, this uses a weapon slot.  Now, on the one hand, that makes it useful so you can use an armor mod too (which I'll cover).  But we still have shotgun/weapon that needs to deal damage.  And we're cutting it's ability to do that effectively.  I won't say NO to this mod.  But consider the weapon mods first.  Mod I: 25% Extra Melee Dam. Increase Mod II: 50% Extra Melee Dam. Increase Mod III: **100%** Extra Melee Dam. Increase  **Weapon Rails**:I won't break these down individually.  It's pretty self-explanatory. Taking one of these buffs your weapon damage for that gun. Take what you need.  Mod I: 10% damage buff Mod II: 20% damage buff Mod II: 30% damage buff  **Cyclonic Modulator**: Arguably the most useful Armor Mod next to the Power Efficiency mod.  Buff those Barriers, take a hit like a boss.  This would be more useful damage wise for a Human Vanguard, but since your other goal is to be a Decoy That Bites Back‚Ñ¢, you could use the buff.  Mod I: 30 % shield strength bonus Mod II: 60 % shield strength bonus Mod III: 100% shield strength bonus  **Power Efficiency Mod**: Reduce your Cooldown times. Since we have Barrier up, and we have a shotgun that isn't exactly, 'light', this is helpful.  I'd take this over most other mods.  Mod I: 10% Faster Cooldown Mod II: 20% Faster Cooldown Mod III: 30% Faster Cooldown  Extra power damage should be mentioned, but isn't that helpful in my opinion.  It will buff your Charge and Barrier damage, but nothing else.  Running Speed won't help either.  The new Shield Regen bonus mod can be useful, but I'd rather have shield strength.  **Ammo**: This is where things get a little tricky.   **Incendiary** is useless for us.  It increases damage, and sets things on fire... But that's it.  No armor reduction.  **Armor Piercing** has an armor reduction bonus, extra damage, and adds bullet penetration.  Useful for everything but the Graal and GPS (and Kishock for those wondering).  **Cryo** adds armor weakness, and a chance to chill or freeze.  Useful.  A pretty solid choice.  But I have a better one.  **Warp** ammo, is where we will shine.  Not only do we get Armor Weakness, and Extra Damage, but we also get extra damage to *lifted targets*.  See why this works well with us?  **Disruptor** ammo is also a great choice.  Chance to stun, Extra Damage, enemy shield regen delay, and it can setup for Tech Bursts if detonated within 3.5 seconds.  I'm not sure if Warp ammo can be detonated (don't believe so). **** *All of my mod and ammo info came from the [Ammo Power Guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/s86qd/ammo_power_guide/) submitted by [LHN](http://www.reddit.com/user/LHN) and [dumael](http://www.reddit.com/user/dumael), who actually submitted the google doc located [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0ArNVjEsDluBFdHdMZlltdVFuNmFKS1c0bkl6WG5PUEE&amp;single=true&amp;gid=0&amp;output=html).* ****  Thanks for reading through this giant wall of text.

Beginning prior to the launch of Diablo III, in order to carry a Battle.net Balance greater than ‚Ç¨100 EUR / ¬£80 GBP (or equivalent), players will be required to attach a Battle.net Authenticator or Battle.net Mobile Authenticator to their Battle.net account.

We‚Äôll go into more detail about the different options for making purchases in the currency-based auction house prior to launch.   &gt;**Global Play:** When Diablo III presales began, we mentioned as part of the purchase process that Diablo III players would be able to choose to play on game servers based in the Americas, Europe, or Asia, regardless of what region they were connecting from or which language-version of the game they purchased (with certain restrictions). As you‚Äôll see in the updated TOU, the name for this functionality is ‚ÄúGlobal Play,‚Äù and we‚Äôll be providing more information about exactly how it works, including the restrictions noted above, prior to Diablo III‚Äôs launch.   &gt;Stay tuned to diablo3.com for further details on the currency-based auction house and Global Play in the coming weeks.

Adenosine is a neurochemical that can cause pain if it's concentrated enough.  The release of adenosine may be a reflex that serves to dilate blood vessels, allowing more blood into the area to warm it up.   I think the reason brain freeze is so painful is that there is a dense concentration of sensory neurons up there in the roof of the nasal passage; a lot of sensory neurons involved in olfaction (smelling). So all those neurons can emit a lot of adenosine.  So according to my theory the pain originates not in the palate (as cheezymadman posits) but higher up, in the roof of the nasal passage.",‚Ñ¢

t5_2r0gj,4blockhead,1334894408,"&gt; Do you ever think that the point of all the ""administrative"" stuff is part of a (perhaps unintentional) self-deception? EG; people get so caught up in the details of their after life, and the steps to attain it, that they never stop to see the bigger picture?  I think it definitely keeps people's minds occupied. They don't have to worry about how many wives Joseph Smith had, or why he was marrying other mens wives, or fourteen year old girls if they're busy rereading the Book of Mormon for the forty-second time. The temple is part of providing an endless amount of busy work for those so inclined to engage in. It's a poker game, and they're betting that if they stick it out to the end they'll win, cash in their chips, and be reunited with their dead relatives. *Surely, all of that time isn't wasted.*  &gt; It seems like Mormons may have a better retention rate.  I have already stated and placed my bets on this subreddit- I think that mormonism is going to be drastically reduced due to information being freely available on the internet. When all of the historical facts about Smith's philandering, the false testimony of the witnesses to the Book of Mormon, are widely recognized and common knowledge leaving will become an entirely viable option. Smith is the lynchpin of the religion, and he's a weak peg- even as a martyr. Because mormonism emerged relatively recently it is still possible to debunk its claims using contemporary known sources. If we had any physical evidence, like the golden plates, matching native american DNA, then they would have a claim to being the *one true church.* Without them, the church is an also-ran. Smith's claims are not enough to hold it all together. The [community of christ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_Christ) have found this to be true, too. I predict an exodus similar to what has happened in the Catholic church when the scale of their abuse was exposed.  The mormons have some unique problems, too. The leadership have invested in [a $5 billion downtown shopping mall](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_Creek_Center).

If there is a more crass way of doing anything it will shortly make its way into the government‚Äôs repertoire of daily behaviors. I leave the 33 gallon, galvanized steel garbage can clattering between the bunks for someone else to retrieve as I make my way to the showers. I dress carefully in the pants and shirt I‚Äôve folded and pressed under my mattress and take pains to securely pin up my long hair. Never give them an excuse! Make up my bunk ship shape. I‚Äôm ready for whatever they throw at me.   At seventeen I‚Äôm here to make my escape. As bad as everyone else thinks this is, it‚Äôs a cakewalk compared to what I‚Äôve been living. As rude, crass, crude and demanding as they are here, it‚Äôs impersonal. They can‚Äôt touch my emotions because I have no attachments, and they can‚Äôt touch me physically unless I start it. Freedom!   Standing in company formation waiting our turn in the mess hall, ‚ÄúThey‚Äù inform us of the new rules. Male and female companies will now be segregated for meals and classes. It takes longer to get breakfast this morning because of the new routine. There‚Äôs lots of grumbling and complaining about this new insult being heaped upon us, but what are we to do? We‚Äôre just a bunch of powerless recruits stuck in a hopeless situation called boot camp.   I finally get my turn at green eggs and Kellogg‚Äôs Raisin Bran with no raisins. I used to think ‚Äúgreen eggs‚Äù was just a nursery rhyme, now I know that if you make up dehydrated eggs in advance and leave them sit long enough before you cook them, they will turn a beautiful shade of snot green. The Raisin Bran? I don‚Äôt know. I think they must buy the stuff that failed quality control and serve that to the recruits. Whatever‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs breakfast of a sort.   I have 20 minutes to eat, drink coffee and warm up. The Master at Arms is the only one allowed to wear a watch; and so I keep a close eye on her, making sure I leave the chow hall before she does. When she returns the Master at Arms stands at the door to the barracks and writes up any one returning from mess after her. They are AWOL. Absent WithOut Leave is just a step shy of desertion; it‚Äôs about the worst thing you can be accused of in the Navy without actually doing anything. Of course it goes without saying that if you‚Äôre accused by the government then you obviously are guilty. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean innocent until proven guilty? You‚Äôre in the Navy now! You have a right to one hour sleep, one meal per day, not necessarily hot and pay if congress has authorized it! That is correct recruit; you gave up your rights when you decided to protect everyone else‚Äôs.‚Äù   I spend most of the morning pondering my new situation. I hate being bullied! I hate stupid rules! Hey, that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm supposed to be escaping. So much for freedom. I‚Äôm supposed to be paying attention to class, learning their version of military history and the Navy rules and regulations, but I‚Äôve already read these books. My recruiter loaned them all to me before I got here. I‚Äôve already quoted page and paragraph to my Company Commander, showing that as a woman I don‚Äôt have to cut my hair, only keep it up off my collar. So much for keeping a low profile. Why can‚Äôt I ever take the easy path?   I go through the same pointless segregation of the sexes again at lunch, but this time I have a plan. I choose my targets carefully; they are the popular ones, the outspokenly disgruntled ones and the watch wearing ones. I pass the idea along, careful not to let the ones in power know what‚Äôs up. The time has been set. The plan formed. The plan widely disseminated. I continue to check on our progress throughout our segregated afternoon classes. I make sure the plan crisscrosses the line.   Again, I am standing in company formation waiting for dinner. This is the third meal of this new routine. You would think it would move faster now, but no, the line has stalled out. There is no movement, no coming and going of the recruits as they finish dinner and head off to study or practice folding their clothes for the next inspection. No movement, company after company of recruits all standing at ease awaiting their turn at what ever slop is being served tonight.   Finally I‚Äôm allowed in line. I dish up my meal. I take some of everything. Lots of everything! I sit down with my company and eat my fill. We all watch our Master at Arms. None of us leave early. Exactly 20 minutes after our Master at Arms sits down, she stands, tray in hand and surveys the company. Seventy nine recruits stand as one; we drop off our trays for the Kitchen Police. Mine is not the only try that is still full to over flowing. The dirty try conveyer is avalanched with the sudden dump from exiting recruits. The excess food and slimy dishes clattering to the floor as we quickly walk back to our barracks. None are late returning.   CRASH, bang, clank, clatter! I quietly drop from the bunk to do it all again. There is no announcement this time, but when we get to the mess hall things have quietly returned to normal. We learn from the KP that the last recruit was served dinner some time after 2300 and the KP were up all night cleaning the mess. More than 8000 recruits participated. Ah, esprit de corps! I think we‚Äôve got it.   Never again will I believe that I am helpless. Never again will I believe myself powerless. Government abuse can only persist in the face of an apathetic citizenry. I have learned to choose my fights with care, but not based on the size of my opponent.  ¬© 2008 Dianne",¬©

t5_2cneq,CRICResearch,1334941154,"From the European CRIC Research Project, directed from Cambridge University: http://www.cric.arch.cam.ac.uk/index.php?id=78  In a short youtube film CRIC researcher Dr. Ioannis Armakolas introduces new heritage research showing the often unexpected outcomes of reconstruction after war , and analyses the complexity of international involvement in this process.  His case study focuses on the post-conflict reconstruction of cultural heritage in Mostar, Bosnia-Herzegovina.  The¬†rebuilding of the iconic 16th century Old Bridge of Mostar was the most¬†prominent and well-publicised international effort for the support of reconstruction of war-ravaged heritage in the Balkans.  The ""new"" Old Bridge was to be a powerful symbol of reconciliation after civil strife , and through this project the international community sought to promote its vision for a new peaceful and multi-ethnic Bosnia. However, the reconstruction of the Old Bridge and other heritage in the city became contested. Ethnic and political conflict among the Mostar's main groups continued, not least through competition over heritage and war memorialisation. This film analyses the idea that cultural heritage reconstruction can become a means of prolonging conflict through non-violent methods.

t5_2qpp6,EvilTomahawk,1334952610,"‚ñ∂ Must we play StarCraft 2?  Fomos: There are gains and losses with the introduction of SC2 into our league, but most of the analysis points to the fact that running a SC1-exclusive league is no longer viable. Some say that the introduction of SC2 is not a choice, but a necessary step in the world of capitalism. Additionally, the issue of finding a sponsor for Team 8 is not completely independent of the overall decision.  Stars Coach Lee: For STX Coach Lee and myself, we were in this business forever. You can call us the grandfathers, the original fans. Nevertheless, times have changed, and we know that we must accept the changes. Sponsorship and other problems don‚Äôt resolve by themselves if we don‚Äôt act.  Team 8 Coach Joo: When I meet with corporate executives, I can definitely feel the tensions and worries. Despite that, my personal wish is for StarCraft 1 to fade away as a legend, but maybe in the future we‚Äôd say the same thing about StarCraft 2. None of us can stop the flow of time. The reality is that not a single country outside Korea has an offline StarCraft 1 league right now. In the times where eSports is going global, we can‚Äôt help but choose StarCraft 2. The times demand that we play both SC1 and SC2. Soon the proleague will be completely SC2, but I dearly wish that we don‚Äôt abandon SC1, which has led and carried eSports for the past decade. Personally, I wish that SC1 would continue, even if the league is much smaller and shorter.  STX Coach Kim: Even if one doesn‚Äôt agree with the introduction of SC2, the real problem has nothing to do with the selection of the game. We have made numerous mistakes in the past and there are still many things we can improve on, but if we don‚Äôt correct them right now then we will be here and discussing the same problems again and again. Team 8 Coach Joo just mentioned that the transition to SC2 was demanded by the popular culture at this time, but I think it‚Äôs our fault that we made SC1 less popular. There was no shortage of popular games in the past decade. Cart Rider and Sudden Attack have much greater number of users than StarCraft 1. Instead of looking at the transition as a cultural evolution kind of view, I think the fault is that we didn‚Äôt give it our best when SC1 scene was at its peak. Really, we‚Äôve boasted about the 100,000 crowd attendance at Gwang-ahn-ri (most of the PL finals were held at this beach), and done nothing else. It will be the same with SC2. Just because it has a large global market, we can‚Äôt be na√Øve about the game. There is no guarantee that the same problems won‚Äôt arise again.  Fomos: But sure, when SC2 came out, SC1 suddenly felt old, and many felt an obligation to play SC2.  STX Coach Lee: I think Blizzard named their new game very well. If the name of SC2 wasn‚Äôt ‚ÄúStarCraft 2‚Äù, I‚Äôm quite certain we wouldn‚Äôt even need to have this talk right now.  Team 8 Coach Joo: The things I said about tidings of time and culture didn‚Äôt mean that we must absolutely play SC2. I was just lamenting at the fact that Korea is the only country with a proper SC1 league. It‚Äôs true that SC2 isn‚Äôt as popular here in Korea as it is globally. Look at MLG, they‚Äôve grown to the stage that they can rent out the Anaheim Convention Centre, and attract a huge number of fans despite the entrance fee. The important fact is that when we made a grand scene with SC1, the global focus was mediocre at best, but the potential for the same is much better with SC2 right now. eSports infrastructure is being developed and refined overseas at an unprecedented pace.  STX Coach Lee: Well, SC1 was released in 1998 and about 2 years later, the game in itself has already sort of faded off. We revived it as legitimate eSports content and have kept it going for this long, until today. It was essentially dead overseas and many people pointed fingers at us for playing an archaic game. However, as times passed, the number of SC1 fans increased, both here and globally. When did TeamLiquid first launch? I feel like the number of SC1 fans are actually steadily growing globally. Of course, we can‚Äôt really compare with the number of SC2 fans, but the interest for SC1 is definitely there. Some are saying SC2 will open the doors to globalize the Korean eSports scene, but I have a different viewpoint on this. Some say sending Korean players to overseas SC2 market is globalization and expansion. I see it as a reduction of our domestic eSports scene. Yes, earning foreign currencies overseas is good for players, but for so many years we‚Äôve declared ourselves the leading eSports country, and it sounds like we‚Äôve given up on being the leader now. If we had a strong infrastructure here and sold only the contents overseas, the players wouldn‚Äôt need to go far away to have a sustainable career.  Fomos: Realistically, it seems impossible for SC1 to be globalized in the way you described it.  STX Coach Kim: I know that‚Äôs the general consensus around, but have anyone really tried their best to do it? The popularity of SC1 rose naturally without any extravagant marketing efforts. The large number of replies on videos and articles on TeamLiquid didn‚Äôt exist a couple years ago. If we want to globalize with SC1, we should have explored those options much earlier. We were consumed in our own arrogance that SC1 was ‚Äúour‚Äù league.  Fomos: On a related note, it is very unfortunate that the Shanghai Proleague finals were cancled last year. It may have been too little too late, but it was one of the largest attempts at globalizing SC1 content.  STX Coach Kim: Exactly. Those should have been made available from the beginning. I‚Äôm not an educated expert on global economy, but in the past two decades where major investments were made into the Chinese market, eSports failed to look into the possibilities. The reason why I‚Äôm blabbing on about this is that we must not miss those opportunities in SC2. When we commit ourselves to SC2, we have to do our best to make it enjoyable, and we must not make the same mistakes we made with SC1. Shouting ‚Äúglobalization‚Äù without any credible knowledge is not the solution.  ‚ñ∂ How fast will the existing progamers adapt to SC2?  Fomos: When SC2 is incorporated, one of the major worries is that neither game will be at the high quality we are accustomed to. Let‚Äôs discuss.  STX Coach Lee: Right now, there is no point in comparing with GSL or other established SC2 leagues. Our job is to work hard to appeal to our fans in the best way possible.  CJ Coach Kim: I agree that we shouldn‚Äôt be comparing game level/quality with other established leagues, but fans will still compare. Then again, our fans have confidence in our progaming team system and the years of experience, so they will patiently wait for us to catch up and even exceed.  Team 8 Coach Joo: The preparation time is very short and the two games will coexist side-by-side instead of a full transition, so it will be tough in many ways. I‚Äôd like to share a little story with our team. You all know that we helped SKT prepare for the finals by being sparring partners. To be honest, since we didn‚Äôt make the playoffs, we were already practising SC2 at the start of postseason. When our players went back to SC1 one morning, they felt like the screen was lagging. Many of them made hotkey mistakes. Then, the same day afternoon, the issues subsided and we were grooving along as usual. Our practice games were amazing, and we beat SKT 4:2 on the mock finals (laughs). Since SC2 has a much faster pace, some players actually micromanaged better in SC2. There will be complaints in the beginning, but most of them will adjust just fine.  Fomos: Perhaps an analogous situation would be runners training with sandbags then taking them off near the competition date? Please share more stories like this, I‚Äôm sure the readers are curious!  Stars Coach Lee: I first thought that the better players in SC1 would be better players in SC2, but it didn‚Äôt hold true for everyone. It‚Äôs more of a case-by-case thing. Some players are only good at SC1, some only at SC2, and some are good at both. In any case, I‚Äôm confident that practice will make up for the gaps. Honestly, some of the players that were, let‚Äôs say, terrible at SC1, are now absolutely demolishing others in SC2. We all started at the same time, but already we‚Äôre seeing skill differences.  ‚ñ∂ StarCraft 2, a new opportunity for players?  Team 8 Coach Joo: One thing that‚Äôs changed in our team is that our players were never late to lunch, and after that they all took the scheduled rest. Now, after lunch, all of them head straight to the computers. It‚Äôs a new game and they find it interesting. I think some of them know that it‚Äôs a new opportunity to climb the ranks, so they focus better than before.  CJ Coach Kim: It‚Äôs true. Some of our players used to feel like catching up to the top class SC1 players were simply impossible. Now, everyone feels like they‚Äôre on even ground. They‚Äôre very committed their practice time.  Team 8 Coach Joo: For all the players who lived in the shadows of TBLS, SC2 is a great opportunity. It‚Äôs like someone hit the reset button, and we‚Äôre off to a new race.  Fomos: To look at the positive side of things, the bottom-rank players would aim to be the new TBLS of SC2, and the existing TBLS and similar level players would aim not to lose their prestigious positions.  Stars Coach Lee: Some of our old players that considered retirement in the past while actually regained the passion while practising for both games. If we kept going with SC1 only, our team would have had retirement news to release.",‚ñ∂
t5_2qpp6,EvilTomahawk,1334952654,"‚ñ∂ Coaches chat about the Proleague  Fomos: It seems like the coach of the champions, SKT Head Coach Park, became rather silent in the past few minutes. I know that you guys are planning to have a vacation in Hawaii, but after that you‚Äôll be strapped on practice time for Season 2.  SKT Coach Park: There are so many things in my mind right now. Even if we squeeze out every day we can, we get 10 days or so.  CJ Coach Kim: Still, the word around town is that SKT will win the upcoming season anyway.  Stars Coach Lee: Yeah! I heard SKT is full of grandmasters.  Team 8 Coach Joo: Is that why the upcoming season is being delayed a little? Did you all hear about the delay?  All: Hehehe  Fomos: If the season is delayed, teams get more practice time... is that why?  CJ Coach Kim: Our team is fine if the season starts tomorrow. Let‚Äôs not give SKT time to practice!  SKT Coach Park: No! Why are you guys all ganging up on me?  Fomos: Wow, the jealousy towards the winning team is definitely real! Back on topic, do some teams just have inherent advantages when it comes to preparing for SC2?  Stars Coach Lee: Yep, that‚Äôs SKT. They act fast, and they somehow get all the information before we do. Plus they steal replays.  CJ Coach Kim: When it comes to SC2, the team is SKT. I heard they are very good already. I heard Bisu and Fantasy were already grandmasters on the ladder, and some others as well.  SKT Coach Park: All rumours, I say! Our best player is diamond. You guys are too caught up in the fact that we practiced SC2 prior to the previous season, but we honestly stopped playing SC2 when the season started, and only recently picked it up again. Actually, what I know is that STX practiced SC2 early, even during Season 1.  STX Coach Lee: Who told you that? We didn‚Äôt touch SC2 during Season 1.  SKT Coach Park: We honestly played SC2 for just 2 weeks, okay? We forbid the players from playing it after that.  STX Coach Kim: The word around town back then was that SC2 would be incorporated into Season 1. KeSPA kept hinting at that, so we did our part in preparing for it. In Season 1, we were at a disadvantageous position because we spent too much time on SC2.  SKT Coach Park: Another thing I want to clarify: we ended our SC2 practice after those two weeks not because we heard that SC2 wouldn‚Äôt be included in Season 1, but because there were so many new maps for SC1. We decided to allocate our time to those new maps, not SC2.  CJ Coach Lee: Considering the ‚Äúlucky‚Äù timing... you also understand that we had to shake our heads about that? (laughs)  STX Coach Kim: Knowing where to get up-to-date information is a good skill to have.  SKT Coach Park: No, that‚Äôs not true. Regarding SC2-related information, isn‚Äôt Woongjin the fastest to access those?  Team 8 Coach Joo: Woongjin does get the info quickly but they‚Äôre just slow at reacting.  All: Hahaha  STX Coach Lee: Yeah, fine, our team spent a considerable amount of time practising SC2. We do have grandmasters in our team. Many of our players felt hostile towards the new game in the beginning, but now they‚Äôve accepted it and they enjoy the game for the most part.  Fomos: When it comes to freedom and low-pressure environment, it‚Äôs Samsung Khan. Coach January, how is your team doing?  Khan Coach January: Our team‚Äôs practice schedule is the toughest of all teams, so I don‚Äôt know why people think our guys have it easy. We are not a loose-minded team. We are practising SC2 at about the same pace as the other teams, but at the moment, I think we are the worst at SC2.",‚ñ∂
t5_2qpp6,EvilTomahawk,1334952666,"‚ñ∂ Things to prepare before SC2  KT Coach Lee: Personally, we are lacking diversity and quantity in contents. We‚Äôre down to just a single broadcasting station and we lost one of the two major individual leagues, so there are too little games nowadays. I hope that with the addition of SC2, more contents will be made available. Other than leagues and competitions, I hope we get more events and TV variety shows. Instead of viewing it as an acceptance of failure in SC2, we should look at SC2 as a new opportunity for expanding our scene.  Team 8 Coach Joo: As Coach Lee said, I hope Ongamenet will be with us in making good preparations for the addition of SC2. Perhaps an introductory-level program, for the fans, would be beneficial.  Stars Coach Lee: All of OGN, KeSPA, the teams, and sponsors must work together to form a positive atmosphere. Our job is to showcase the exciting, high-level games, but all is meaningless if there are no fans. We have to prioritize our fans. There is very little time remaining, and we must act fast.  KT Coach Lee: Do you remember the program called ‚ÄúDoctor Yong‚Äôs Manner Pylon‚Äù? [T/N: Kingdom had his own SC1 show] In the beginning people were confused as to why such a show was necessary, but I remember that it gained popularity quite quickly and the viewership numbers were decent. Similar kind of informative and fun programs will be needed for SC2.  SKT Coach Park: I agree, and I have similar ideas as well. I hope that the association will vitalize the amateur scene with amateur leagues and such. Playing it once is better than hearing about it a hundred times. We have to work towards increasing the number of users.  CJ Coach Lee: But, from OGN‚Äôs point of view, they can‚Äôt allocate that much time and money into SC2 if they aren‚Äôt going to have the viewership numbers to justify it. Nowadays, they‚Äôre trying very hard to popularize LoL.  Stars Coach Lee: Hopefully we‚Äôll have more broadcasting stations and internet casts in the future. It may seem unreasonable to do everything at once right now, but these are issues that we must eventually tackle together, piece by piece.  ‚ñ∂ Time will remedy the players‚Äô skill issue.  Fomos: With all that being said, the number of SC1 fans still overwhelms the number of SC2 fans in Korea. In that aspect, the addition of SC2 seems rather force-fed. To hold on to fan support, the key will be how fast can players showcase the level of skill they used to in SC1. Some fans worry that should some of the high-profile SC1 fail to adapt, their legends and records will be tainted. For example, a godly figure like Flash can potentially crumble to newbies in SC2, or he could continue his dominance in the new game as well.  KT Coach Lee: Flash didn‚Äôt play SC2 for a long time. All the experience he has with SC2 comes from a short period of time while he was in rehabilitation. He didn‚Äôt even know what the units do or were good at, but he managed to reach masters with ease. I am one of the many that are curious to see how well he will do in SC2.  All: Sigh, it‚Äôs Flash again.  Khan Coach January: We should force Flash to play Protoss in SC2.  Team 8 Coach Joo: Nono, I‚Äôll make Jaedong play Terran so you should make Flash play Zerg~.  KT Coach Lee: Prior to this season, the abolishment of ace matches attracted a ton of criticism, and many fans were worried for us. However, many fans grew to appreciate and enjoy the new format anyway. We can make it enjoyable for the fans.  Stars Coach Lee: The current generation of SC2 superstars all have some history with us. MVP used to be with us. Other ex-BW progamers include Nestea, July, MMA, etc. Maybe we can call them for some helpful tips on how to transition successfully. I am confident that all the players will reach excellent playing quality in a very short time.  KT Coach Lee: If we had the time, we could have tested it out in a pre-season format. Too bad that we‚Äôre running short.  Stars Coach Lee: The bottom line is, if the addition of SC2 fails, both SC1 and SC2 could die. In the times where eSports is losing its fire, we have to do whatever it takes to make it burn brightly again. If the side-by-side, mixed format happens to go well with the fans, I‚Äôm fine with this format for the season after that as well.  Team 8 Coach Joo: Pessimistic people said that SC1 has been dead for years now, but look at the recent Proleague Finals. The game quality was excellent, and fan support was overwhelming. Again, we come back to this, the key to the future of eSports is in the hands of the fans. Another important aspect is the history of eSports, written by the star players. I am certain that in SC2, star players and stylistic players will arise and make headlines. I hope that teams and media can catch on to those and produce interesting stories for the ages. From what I‚Äôve seen at our practice, game quality will not be a problem for long.  ‚ñ∂ Last words, for the fans!  Fomos: Thank you all for participating. Before we call it a day, I would like each one of you to have a few words for the fans.  STX Coach Kim: I fear that I happened to play devil‚Äôs advocate today, but really I am excited and hopeful for the upcoming season. Playing both games will not be easy, especially when we are relatively unfamiliar with one of the games. However, SC2 has a simple interface and we have transferrable skills from SC1, so it won‚Äôt take long. I‚Äôm sure if you fans stick with the players and the teams, you will be comfortable with the new format. We are facing a new challenge, and I hope that you will be there with us.  Khan Coach January: It‚Äôs sad that the new format was hammered down to us with very little input from the players and the teams. That‚Äôs why I didn‚Äôt have a lot to say in this conference. As a coach, I will do my best and I can say for the players that they‚Äôll each give it their best as well. Pushing for the survival of SC1 may be a tough thing to ask, but I hope the upcoming leagues will reflect the opinions and desires of the fans and the players. I ask you to be open-minded about the changes, and we‚Äôll do our part to provide you with quality content.  STX Coach Lee: Let me add that it‚Äôs true what Coach January said; communication within the league is not very active. I hope that that more communication windows will be open between the players, fans, coaches, sponsors, and the league.  Team 8 Coach Joo: Fans support was overwhelming as always in Season 1, but we didn‚Äôt have enough contents to showcase. After all, SC1 only had one league in the past few months. We can‚Äôt let our guard down just because the stadium attendance was up. When SC2 is added, I know that satisfactory smiles from SC1 game could immediately turn into frowns when SC2 is aired next. We will do our best to prevent that from happening. If fans leave the scene, eSports will cease to exist. I hope that some of the league executives and producers will keep that in mind.  Stars Coach Lee: There will be uphills and downhills. Now we aim to climb a new mountain. KeSPA, the teams, and the players ‚Äì we all have to climb together. I was full of worries at first, but now have high hopes for the future. SC2 isn‚Äôt the end solution, and it‚Äôs possible that we try different games in the future too. No matter what mountain lies ahead, I hope the fans will be with us all the way. Lastly, since TBLS is all reset now, next season belongs to Woongjin Stars!  CJ Coach Kim: I think all the coaches want to say the same thing. We‚Äôll give it our best, and we‚Äôre positive that the outcome will be good as well. Even outside of eSports, new challenges shake things up and negativity will be there in the beginning. Please continue to support us, and let us know how we can make it better for you. We will do our best.  KT Coach Lee: Even after the closing of MBC Game and the disbanding of several teams, we couldn‚Äôt have a proper conference like this. I know that this conference owes a lot to Fomos and their 5th anniversary celebration, but I also think the desire for the better future of eSports put us together today. Every single player, every single person involved is working with the common goal, so I ask you to let us know how you feel. Give us both criticism and support. Soon before you know it, we‚Äôll dazzle you with the games you love.  SKT Coach Park: For the loyal SC1 fans, I understand the mixed format looks like a complete foolish gimmick. I hope you understand that it was the best we could do under the current circumstances. I encourage you to have high hopes for the upcoming season. I‚Äôm confident that Bisu and Fantasy will be global leaders in SC2, so look out for us!

We need something to give everything meaning. Which is fine on its own; it gives us drive, and is likely one of the reasons humans can strive toward any sort of excellence at all, but it does mean you'll occasionally be left doubting the world and miserable. Some of the most impressive leaps of human understanding and art have originated with people who had serious life problems. It lends a different perspective. However, in our search for something to give life, or death, meaning... we often lose touch with reality itself.

Let me know if that helps. If you find one w/o a HDD I have an older PATA HDD i'd give you for the cost of shipping, I think it's a 320GB or 500. Anyway, I hope that helps.  ",‚Ñ¢

t5_2qh2s,amightyrobot,1334985559,"I'll take my best crack at this:  First, yes, you *could* learn how to play with just the two of you. It would, though, be *very* difficult to play most RPGs with two, and I'd imagine this applies double to party-based fantasy adventures like D&amp;D. First of all, one of you would have to act as GM, so really only one of you would be ""playing,"" per se - and a one-man party isn't a party at all. There's nothing in the mechanics that would prevent you from running an adventure this way, but you'd have to write one from the ground up, since just about every single published adventure presupposes a party of at least 3-4. Plus, I imagine it would strip a whole lot of the fun away (again, ESPECIALLY with D&amp;D).  So, the question becomes: how do you find people to play with? First answer, probably the most obvious one and also how I personally got into RPGs: Drag your friends in. Explain what the game's about, ask them to try it once, pay for the pizza and drinks (just the once; that shit gets expensive week-to-week), and more than likely you'll all have fun and they'll want to come back for more. Where you find these friends depends on how old you are, I suppose: we could be talking school friends, roommates, classmates, coworkers... you interact with dozens of people every single day of your life; just think of a few of those people who you know pretty well and who you think would be fun to game with. Worst that happens is they say 'no'.  If you can't muster up enough friends who are willing to play D&amp;D, it's time to hit your *Friendly Local Game Store‚Ñ¢*! Most game stores, and even comic stores etc. that happen to sell stuff like D&amp;D and M:TG and other trappings of geekdom, have game nights/afternoons/whatever. People, usually a surprising number, usually of a surprisingly wide range of ages and backgrounds, gather at the store and game. They might not be playing the game you want to play (though someone probably will, D&amp;D/Pathfinder being far and away the most popular setting), but they'll be playing SOMETHING, and more than likely they'll be overjoyed to bring new people into the hobby.  If your FLGS either a) isn't cool enough to have regular events like this, or b) doesn't exist, you might be relegated to finding games to play over Skype or the like, and Reddit is a good tool for that (as is RPG.net or the WOTC/Paizo boards). But, honestly, strive for a face-to-face game if you can; playing over the computer, you're losing a huge part of what makes these games so much fun.  As for system: I actually haven't played D&amp;D or Pathfinder, so I can't speak to that. I can tell you there's a whole mess of other games out there, if you want to try something with simpler (or crunchier) rules, or a different setting. I can also tell you *most* people I talk to seem to dig Pathfinder over D&amp;D in general, though there's the occasional guy who raves about how clean and balanced 4E is. If the discouragement from your parents' friends happened to come from weird fears about how fantasy RPGs turn kids into satanists, another setting might help keep them off your back as well. There are games for just about any genre you can think of - Sci-Fi, Fantasy, Horror, Pulp action, Steampunk... so be creative and play whatever sounds awesome to you!",‚Ñ¢

Unfortunately, since the Bible (Old Testamant and New) is pretty clear about Yahweh's position on these things, holding a belief in Loving Hippie Jesus‚Ñ¢ requires ignoring huge portions of it. Or just never reading it in the first place, which seems to be the most popular option.  Well, let's say what Jesus has to say about that:  &gt;‚ÄúDo not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished.  (Matthew 5:17-18, NIV)  Some Christians claim that his death and resurrection ""fulfill"" this. That is bullshit for one simple reason: last time I checked, Heaven and Earth haven't passed away.  Jesus also made his views on people ""picking and choosing"" quite clear:  &gt;[Jesus] answered them, ‚ÄúAnd why do you break God‚Äôs commandment because of your tradition? For God said:    *Honor your father and your mother;* and, *The one who speaks evil of father or mother must be put to death.*  &gt; But you say, ‚ÄòWhoever tells his father or mother, ‚ÄúWhatever benefit you might have received from me is a gift committed to the temple‚Äù‚Äî  he does not have to honor his father.‚Äô In this way, you have revoked God‚Äôs word because of your tradition. Hypocrites! Isaiah prophesied correctly about you when he said:    &gt;These people honor Me with their lips, but their heart is far from Me.  They worship Me in vain, teaching as doctrines the commands of men.‚Äù  (Matthew 15:3-9, NIV)   Looks like Jesus has quite a bit to say about people who ignore commandments, in fact. But maybe it's just Matthew?  &gt;It is easier for heaven and earth to disappear than for the least stroke of a pen to drop out of the Law.  (Luke 16:17, NIV)  Okay, so Jesus is a bust. Let's see what the Epistles have to say about the Mosaic Code:  &gt; If you really keep the royal law found in Scripture, ‚ÄúLove your neighbor as yourself,‚Äù you are doing right.  But if you show favoritism, you sin and are convicted by the law as lawbreakers. For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it.   (James 2:8-10, NIV)  &gt;All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness,  (2 Timothy 3:16)  &gt;Do we, then, nullify the law by this faith? Not at all! Rather, we uphold the law.  (Romans 3:31)  Well, shit.   This problem disappears quite quickly if you assert that most of the Bible is hogwash, and you only care about the good parts. If you prefer to cling to it as an inspired document, vague mutterings about ""context"" or about Jesus abolishing the old Law won't get you anywhere. ",‚Ñ¢

The screen is the part of the laptop that you'll spend the most time interacting with, so don't skimp on it. * NVIDIA¬Æ GeForce¬Æ GTX 675M (Fermi) 2GB GDDR5 - A powerful GPU will be the most important thing for gaming. You might want to consider waiting until more powerful cards become available - I've heard good things about the 7990M and 7970M, though I don't know when they'll be out (read: not in the next month). * Hard Drive - Either go with an SSD or a Hybrid drive. The P150EM and P151EM *should* support mSATA drives, but Malibal doesn't seem to offer that; if you were to buy from XoticPC, I would recommend an 80GB mSATA drive as the OS and either a normal HD or a Hybrid drive, depending on your budget (alternatively, to avoid having to deal with limited space on the OS drive, an mSATA configured as SRT and a large HD). * IC Diamond 7 Thermal Compound, CPU &amp; GPU - You don't want to overheat, and the better thermal compound will help a bit. * Processor Upgrades - The i7-2670QM is probably fast enough for DIII, though it couldn't hurt to upgrade it a bit; if you wait for a few days it might be replaced with a IB variant at the same price (NDA is lifting tomorrow, supposedly, which would mean that they'll probably be available to buy sometime this coming week). * Memory Upgrades - From what I've heard, there's not much noticeable difference between 1600Mhz RAM and 1866Mhz RAM, and 8GB is enough for gaming; you can always upgrade it later if you really need it. * Wireless - I recall reading an article comparing the basic wifi card with higher-end variants; the main difference was in the time it took to connect to wireless networks. Probably not worth it. * Optical Drive - Upgrade to blu-ray if you think you'll need it, or put a hard drive in if you really need extra space. * OS - Whatever works for you. * Warranty - I was reading a discussion over on Notebook Review a few days ago about whether it's worth it; [Here's the link](http://forum.notebookreview.com/sager-clevo/657530-2-3-year-sager-parts-warranty-worth.html).

t5_2s8bl,fightslikeacow,1335116289,"[](/c29) Alternate Season 3 opens with the Mane 6, Cadence and Shining Armor dragging running away when the Changeling Queen is distracted by the new power.  Shining Armor and Cadence have to forcibly prevent Twilight from staying to protect Celestia, while Rainbow Dash assures Twilight that she'll be all right, she's one tough pony.  (Fluttershy mutters under her breath that she's not so sure.)  Cut to opening theme song.    As they run through the castle, they realize that they still need to find the Elements of Harmony.  Now the Changelings are super-powered, but they're starting to fight amongst themselves, as some wish to consume all of Canterlot, but others want to use their new power to take power in the heirarchy of changelings, some run off to go and conquer their own corner of the world.  A few are just changing into stranger and stranger things.  One changes into Discord, and suddenly its eyes go googly and it sprints away to the Canterlot Gardens.    Our heroes take their chance and, through a series of close calls (and more than a few Changelings tricked in the confusion), sneak their way to the Elements.  Along the way, they meet up with Spike, who tells them that he saw Twilight's parents be teleported away by friends of theirs.  They had looked like they were in a state of shock.  The Changeling Queen is seen in cutaway scenes consolidating her power, while Celestia tries to talk her into saving the ponies of Equestria, especially from the muderous rage of one of her chief lieutenants. Meanwhile, that lieutenant (let's call him the Changeling Commander) discovers the existence of the Elements of Harmony from a librarian he eats (he was disguised as the one book this librarian needed to take before she fled, as she clutches it to her chest with one hoof, the book mutates and expands, growing teeth and a mouth that swallows her in one gulp.   Our heroes get to the Elements, and Twilight convinces her friends not to run away with the Elements, as they had originally been planning, but to use them to defeat the Changelings now.  Its the only way to save Celestia, and the only way to save Canterlot.  If they don't make a stand, thousands of ponies will die.  Shining Armor, however, is not convinced.  The Changeling Queen overpowered *Celestia*, and that was before she got supercharged by Cadence, Princess of Love.  He's not looking forward to seeing his little sis and his fianc√É¬©e, his two favorite ponies in the world, be destroyed. They need a plan and they need more muscle. They can regroup with the Royal Guard battalion who were doing training maneuvers outside of Trottingham. Shining Armor is a Captain of the Royal Guard, and isn't about to argue, so he tries to teleport them away to safety, but he is too weak.  So's Cadence.  Twilight won't take no for an answer. She and her friends have saved Equestria twice with the Elements of Harmony, her brother doesn't know how much she's grown.  They agree to put it to a vote.  Three ponies are for leaving: Shining Armor, Cadence, Spike (sheepishly) and Rarity--what Shining Armor said made sense.  Fluttershy abstains.  But more are against leaving: Rainbow Dash, Applejack, Twilight, Pinkie Pie and... Spike?  The first Spike laughs an evil laugh.  He's the Changeling Commander, who slipped in while they argued.  The Commander transforms into a huge version of himself and grabs Fluttershy before Twilight can teleport them out.  End part 1.  To be continued.",¬©

When I finally ended our friendship, I had to do it in a way that hurt her so that she wouldn't be tempted to contact me again or if I tried to she'd reject me. Not pretty, not fun. Things are better for me because I don't really think about her now. I don't know how things are for her. I think she's about to finish grad school so she can go live with her sailor husband that she married six months ago. Maybe she's finally stopping crying every single day, maybe she hasn't. Not my deal anymore. Her BFF, a friend of mine, doesn't talk to me about her much, but things seem okay with her now. I just wish I could have done more to make her life easier, but at a certain point I had to say ""this isn't my job"" and let it go. It's hard to do that to a friend. It's a betrayal. Um. So yeah. But things are definitely better for me and they would not have improved if I hadn't done what I did, which *really* sounds selfish but trust me, I did her a huge favor. TV Tropes calls it a Zero Approval Gambit, I later found out. I think it worked. It's been a year and four months (the whole ordeal happened around New Year's Eve 2010, so it's easy to keep track of how long it's been) and my life is definitely better. And you know, it's not anything she did. This was all on me. She made her choices and I found it impossible to respect them. After I realized what I was doing (I came dangerously close to being a Nice Guy‚Ñ¢ for a while there) it took me some time to come to the conclusion that I just needed to ""break up"" with her in a way that would stop me from coming back into her life or vice versa.

I recently read with interest a Harper's magazine article discussing alternative fasting during chemotherapy resulting in much higher survival rates.  http://harpers.org/archive/2012/03/0083829   Personally, we have found information about Joanna Budwig useful. Basically it's using a strict diet and cottage cheese and flaxseed oil to help oxygenate your cells. Budwig was a German government biochemist who studied fats and oils.    This website has a lot of the research that supports her theory and the basic outlines of her diet, the flaxseed/cottage cheese, etc.  It's basically an organic, vegetarian diet with cottage cheese and flaxseed oil blended. Avoid all sugar and meat. Her books are on amazon.  http://www.healingcancernaturally.com/budwig_protocol.html   What I find impressive about Budwig is she's a 7-time Nobel nominee, a German scientist who worked for the German government researching the health effects of oils and fats. Link to research page and testimonials: http://www.healingcancernaturally.com/index-budwig-testimonials-research.html Who Was Dr. Johanna Budwig? Dr. Johanna Budwig (born 30 September 1908, died 19 May 2003, pronounced Yaw-hun-nah Bood-vig), a seven-times Nobel prize nominee, was a qualified German pharmacologist, chemist and physicist with a doctorate in physics who worked as the chief expert-consultant for drugs and fats at the former Bundesanstalt f√ºr Fettforschung (Federal Institute for Fats Research). Described as ""the world's leading authority on fats and oils"", Dr. Budwig studied in-depth the effect of hydrogenated and other denatured fats upon human health and found it to be desastrous, while she discovered the truly ""essential"" and powerfully healing nature of essential fatty acids on all manner of degenerative diseases including cancer. She authored numerous books (among them Cancer - The Problem and The Solution, Das Fettsyndrom [The Fat Syndrome, discussing the links between fats and next to all diseases of the heart and lung as well as cancer], Krebs, ein Fettproblem [Cancer - A Fat Problem, on the right choice and use of fats], Der Tod des Tumors [The Death of the Tumor], as well as numerous scientific papers and treatises in which she published her findings on the critical importance of the right fatty acids and the deleterious effect of the wrong fats on human health (the use of ""wrong fats"" having become widespread since the invention and ubiquitous introduction of the hy  YOU CAN GET HER BOOKS ON AMAZON.  BELOW ARE SNIPPETS FROM THE WEBSITE.    Cancer: Essentially A Problem of Right and Wrong Fats &amp; Lack of Sunlight? An important introduction to Dr. Budwig's protocol Copyright ¬© 2005 - 2011 Healing Cancer Naturally ""What she (Dr. Johanna Budwig) has demonstrated to my initial disbelief but lately, to my complete satisfaction in my practice is: CANCER IS EASILY CURABLE, the treatment is dietary/lifestyle, the response is immediate; the cancer cell is weak and vulnerable; the precise biochemical breakdown point was identified by her in 1951 and is specifically correctable, in vitro (test tube) as well as in vivo (real)..."" Dr. Dan C. Roehm M.D. FACP (oncologist &amp; former cardiologist) in ""Townsend Letter for Doctors"", July 1990 What would you think if you heard someone claim that there is a diet-based protocol centered on the ingestion of two simple foodstuffs plus sunlight that has actually helped heal numerous cases of cancer including saving the so-called terminally ill - some given a few hours to live!? If you react like many, you will think that this sounds far too simplistic to be true. And yet it is. As Dr Willner, M.D., Ph.D. (The Cancer Solution) writes, ""Numerous, independent clinical studies published in major medical journals world-wide confirm Dr. Budwig‚Äôs findings‚Ä¶. Over 40 years ago Dr Budwig presented clear and convincing evidence, which has been confirmed by hundreds of other related scientific research papers since, that the essential fatty acids were at the core of the answer to the cancer problem‚Ä¶You will come to your own conclusions as to why this simple effective prevention and therapy has not only been ignored‚Äîit has been suppressed!"". Or as someone commented, ""Over the years I have been given a lot of different advice as well, so when I heard about Dr Budwig‚Äôs protocol I too was very sceptical, until I tried it."" Before you proceed to reading any further, please know that not everybody reacts the same to this or any other treatment, and that in any healing diet or protocol one may undertake, one should never underrate the often amazing power of the Mind, i.e. the placebo or belief effect, as well as the influence of the emotions and energetic and spiritual factors on both the disease and healing process.   Comments on Dr. Budwig‚Äôs work As mentioned above, Dr. Budwig and her work have been attacked and silenced by vested medical, industrial and pharmaceutical interests throughout her life (compare History of Alternative Cancer Treatment). A very balanced comment by Dr. Vincent Gammill of the non-profit Center for the Study of Natural Oncology reads: ""Budwig's observations were correct, but her conclusions require clarification. Flax oil or FSO/CC [cottage cheese] is not in and of itself an anticancer diet. It simply helps correct (perhaps even overcorrects) an omega-3 deficiency in our diet. This can affect many pathways ranging from prostaglandins to cellular immune function."" In fact, Dr Armin Grunewald, MD, Dr. Budwig's nephew concurs when he writes, ""Dr. Budwig's approach is not a method of healing cancer but a technique which strengthens the body's own immune defence against cancerous cell  Memorable Quotes on Dr. Budwig's work In addition to quotes already featured above, here are statements by Dr. Budwig and more comments by several physicians and researchers. ""This diet is far and away the most successful anti-cancer diet in the world"". Dr. Dan C. Roehm M.D. FACP (oncologist &amp; former cardiologist) ""I suggest that all those who find it necessary to add other protocols or to add supplements to it have not even given the Budwig Protocol half a chance. They just don't look beyond the flaxoil/cottage cheese part. There is much more to it than that. It is a scientifically well thought out, all natural approach to health, that has a tremendous rate of success and track record... and it costs next to nothing. I think that if it were very expensive and much money could be made on it, it would be much more popular because it would be pushed by business. But as it stands, it doesn't lend itself to it. So you have to take it at practically no cost or go for some other high priced methods."" Wilhelm H ""It's not the results of the ‚Äòbone scans‚Äô or ‚ÄòCTs‚Äô which are of crucial importance ... but whether the cancer can be gotten under control or not. While many of the test methods used by us physicians are certainly scientific, they say nothing about the patient's state of health*. Dr. Budwig's approach is not a method of healing cancer but a technique which strengthens the body's own immune defence against cancerous cells.""  ""Of all the nutritional theories that I have investigated, Dr. Johanna Budwig‚Äôs is definitely number one ... Nowhere in the world have I found not even remotely such fantastic cases as with Dr. Budwig. It‚Äôs phenomenal."" Lothar Hirneise, eminent German cancer researcher and author of Chemotherapy Heals Cancer and The Earth Is Flat ""Over 50% of Dr. Budwig's patients were doctors or relatives of doctors who knew why in such a serious disease they would rely on the experiences of this brilliant physicist, chemist and pharmacologist rather than follow the prevailing opinion which says that tumors must be destroyed through chemotherapy and radiation."" From the back cover of Dr. Budwig's last book: Cancer - The Problem and The Solution ""And what do I actually do? I give cancer patients simple, natural foods. That is all. I take sick people out of the hospital, when it is said there that they do not have more than an hour or two left to live, that the scientifically attested diagnosis is at hand and that the patient is completely moribund. In most cases I can help even these patients quickly and conclusively.""",¬©

Published on Tuesday, February 24, 2004 by the Los Angeles Times  Politics Questioned in Hospital Plan Proposed children's facility in Iraq is backed by first lady and linked to a Bush family friend  by T. Christian Miller and Johanna Neuman   WASHINGTON ‚Äî Earlier this year, First Lady Laura Bush formed an unusual alliance with the White House National Security Council to fund a new state-of-the-art children's hospital in Iraq.  But rather than being embraced as a welcome addition to a nation with a shattered healthcare system, the proposed hospital has quietly become a battleground.  Critics have questioned not only the wisdom of a high-end hospital in a country without basic healthcare, but the politics behind the proposal. The hospital would be operated under the guidance of Project Hope, a charity whose president is a Bush family acquaintance from Texas.  The clash, believed to be one of the few between the White House and Congress over a specific reconstruction project, has left the National Security Council bargaining for the hospital's fate and legislators questioning the administration's overall plan to rebuild Iraq.  ""I am concerned about spending large sums on a state-of-the-art hospital that may be more the result of political pressure than the best use of taxpayer dollars,"" Sen. Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Operations Subcommittee, said in a statement.  In an interview with The Times, Laura Bush acknowledged her support for the project and stressed the importance of improving children's healthcare in Iraq, which has one of the highest rates of child mortality in the Middle East.  She said the idea first came up in conversations with national security advisor Condoleezza Rice and Shirin Tahir-Kheli, the NSC's senior director for democracy, human rights and international operations.  The first lady said she knew Project Hope's chief executive, John P. Howe III, from his days as president of the University of Texas Health Science Center, when President Bush was the state's governor.  Her determination to build the hospital comes as the first lady seeks a higher profile in government and politics during a presidential campaign year. She has already stepped up her appearances at fundraisers and begun a campaign to raise awareness of women's heart health issues.  ""It will be a hospital with new, good equipment,"" Bush said. ""We hope that can come to pass.""  The hospital, with a price tag of at least $500 million, ran into trouble almost as soon as the administration introduced it in Congress in January as part of a cluster of projects to be financed from $18.6 billion in reconstruction funds approved last fall.  The initial proposal called for ""state-of-the-art tertiary pediatric"" care, with a child cancer ward and centers for high-risk pregnancies, burn treatment and even plastic surgery.  Rep. Jim Kolbe, an Arizona Republican who heads the House Appropriations subcommittee on foreign operations, raised doubts about the necessity of such an expensive hospital in a country with little infrastructure, according to GOP sources.  Congressional staffers who reviewed the proposal expressed skepticism about whether it was better to fund a high-end medical facility or pay for basic public health measures such as clean water and vaccinations.  ""It was a question of opportunity cost,"" said a Republican budget analyst. ""We only have so much money. The question is, 'Where is the most productive use?' ""  In response to the objections, NSC officials repeatedly stressed the first lady's backing of the hospital and Project Hope, according to congressional officials who were involved in the negotiations.  In the end, Kolbe agreed to provide about $4 million to the project for drawing up blueprints and operating plans for a hospital focused on primary medical needs.  An NSC official defended the project as necessary to improve children's healthcare in Iraq.  ""A children's hospital will give children access to quality care for a range of pediatric medical conditions and save countless lives,"" the official said.  Another person close to the project said, ""This is more than symbolic.""  The NSC, which has scrambled to repackage the hospital proposal, is expected to come back with a modified plan later this week. The plan is expected to call for Project Hope to raise $50 million for training and equipment for the facility.  One version of the plan called for U.S. taxpayers to fund the hospital under a $50-million contract awarded in open competition by the U.S. Agency for International Development, which has overseen much of the infrastructure improvements to Iraq's health system. The agency would build the hospital so that it could be expanded to the higher-end pediatric facility that was envisioned initially.  USAID officials said such public-private partnerships have been used before, once with Project Hope at a children's hospital in Shanghai. Project Hope raised more than $40 million for that facility.  They stressed that no final decision had been reached on the Iraq project, even though a USAID contractor has posted a job listing on the Internet for a construction manager.  ""These partnerships are a win-win because they bring in the private sector to match the U.S. government contribution, resulting in the best deal for the U.S. taxpayer,"" said Luke Zahner, a spokesman for the agency.  One proposed location for the hospital was Basra, but community leaders there questioned the need for a specialized children's hospital. Improving the decrepit, 682-bed general hospital should take priority, they said. There are also continuing problems with the supply of water and electricity.  More than 80% of the city government's office equipment, supplies and vehicles were looted after Saddam Hussein's fall last year, said Fakhir Mousawi, Basra's director general.  ""I would prefer that that money be spent on the services and infrastructure that we need right now,"" Mousawi said. ""Most of the public utilities should get maintenance and rehabilitation.""

I love the little kink in your locks as they meet your shoulders, but I think straight hair suits you much, much more - maybe invest in hair straighteners or take a little bit of length off so it's not as heavy, if you don't want to cut or straighten it then maybe look at tying it back?

t5_2qil9,Malissin,1335200152,"This is a terrific idea.  It really pleases me to see a player take the initiative to come up with a system for placing bounties on other players.  Sandbox and all that.  Anyway, you asked for flaws, so here's what immediately pops out at me.  1. Price data relies on Battleclinic.  Nothing you can really do about it, but I've never seen a killboard that I considered accurate.  CCP has already unveiled plans to increase information present in KMs, including price data, so this could solve this problem for you soon‚Ñ¢.   2. How do you intend to decide who gets to collect on a bounty?  Only final blow?  If not, what if 5 people, all of whom are present on the killmail, all try to collect a bounty?  If so, what if a person on the killmail, but not the final blow wants to collect on a bounty and the final blow dealer doesn't?    3.  What, if any, is the time limit for collecting on a bounty?  If someone dies multiple times over a period of time, and then people begin collecting bounties, but the bounty pool runs out, when someone places a new bounty, can someone collect on the new bounty using an old killmail?  If not, do you have any plan to keep your bounty hunters happy when they're getting kills against bounty targets, but when they come to collect there's no ISK left.  4. Alts still make more money collecting on their main's bounty.  To use your example elsewhere in the comments, if someone with a 100m bounty flying a 40m ship dies to someone else, then your analysis is spot on.  But, if it's their alt doing the killing, it's something more like this:   Person A has a bounty of 100m isk   Person A uses an alt to kill his ship valued at 40m   Person A then collects his reward of 40m isk through website.   Person A then collects his insurance payout of ~10m isk   Person A then collects his loot drops of ~15m isk   Person A has now lost 40m and collected ~65m isk   Person A could care less about the lossmail to his alt.    Alternatively, person A used the option to verify the killmail through your site and it never even appears on a killboard to affect his oh-so-precious efficiency.   FWIW, I do have some suggestions on how to handle some of the above, and would be happy to share, but I'd like to see what your own thoughts are on it first.",‚Ñ¢

t5_2qil9,atomicoption,1335205904,"I'm not sure I can agree with any of that. You're right that *if* the goals for nullsec are as you state, your solutions may help, but I'm not convinced those are the right goals for nullsec.  ***Conflicting visions for nullsec: ***  -----------------------------------------------------  **Vision 1. A land of many princes**  This vision is the one we hear endlessly from small pirate corps who want to damage the sov of major alliances. They want nullsec to be more like lowsec where ownership is fluid from day to day if not hour to hour depending on who can make and maintain a show of force in a given spot. Everyone gets a small chunk of space, but it's very unstable.  People who favor this vision want mechanics that neuter blobs and force the number of pilots in your corp to be much less important if not irrelevant compared to tactics or the skill of your pilots--including for sov. People who prefer this usually favor eliminating structure shoots and implementing mechanics that have nothing to do with your ability to repeatedly field a fleet with the high DPS currently needed to down all the structures and stront timers in a reasonable amount of time..                                    -  **Vision 2. Player owned empires**  This vision is more similar to what we have. In it Sov should work more like the hisec empires do, where major alliances create relatively stable sov regions with complicated hierarchy's of loyalty, alliances, betrayals, espionage and politics.   Sov is purposely difficult to take without a large group of people and huge ISK investment from all different time zones that can be coordinated together for days or weeks. Small pirates and gangs may be able to harass individual ships or other small groups, but they have little chance of seriously damaging (much less taking and holding) sov against the large player empires. This vision is similar to the current idea of the nation in real life where 99% of the places on earth are held by some large country and while a group of 20 guys can make an area unsafe for others, they have no hope (*and shouldn't have any hope*) of actually challenging the sovereign of the area. Territory changes hands via treaty or during large scale wars between alliances, and small corps and alliances rely on NPC pirate sov areas to maintain a foothold.  The people who favor this vision usually just want quality of life changes that break the monotony of endless structure shoots during wars. Some also want a mechanic to police against AFK cloakers, or the easily gankability of mining ops, or the nightmare of large scale logistics.    -----------------------------------------------------------  [full disclosure: I'm in dreddit]  Personally I prefer vision 2 because this is where the biggest drama in EVE comes from. Without large alliances you wouldn't have had the massive, newsworthy scandals, thefts and intrigue that put EVE in the gaming press regularly. Massive wars also give me a sense of being part of Something Important¬Æ. EVE is definitely not the most fun game I've ever played, but it is the most *interesting* game. I constantly get distracted by other games that are much more fun, but I keep coming back to EVE because the concepts are just so cool.  Also without the large relatively stable alliance sov areas, nullsec wouldn't be a worthwhile place to make ISK and we'd all have to have hisec mission running alts.",¬Æ
t5_2snuc,Mein_Captian,1335205916,"Atheism started off as a negative claim of not believing in a god, but it has slowly evolving into a positive claim of there are no gods in some places, accelerated by the ""new"" Atheist movement.

But do you really have knowledge of all servers to start calling everyone who disagrees with you racist?  First, Any good server (which I'd like to think I am) does they're best to treat all tables equally, even the ones you hate. And don't think that every server sees a black table coming and thinks to themselves, ""well, i'm not giving them service"". I'm pleasantly surprised any time I get a good tip. It's nice to know people like you, and even better when they show it in monetary form. That doesn't mean that my expectations aren't lower for some groups than others.  Second. If a business owner was presented with four different choices of a merchandise vender, he would chose the one that would generate the most money and required the least sacrifice on his part. That's the same choice servers have to make every single day. The problem is this study only looked at black v. white. I would treat a black table better than a white one if they were more polite, but there are other races and other factors out there too. I would treat drinkers better than a church crowd because I know the work would be easier and the reward would be better.  Third. That study really isn't the best one to base an opinion on. It's more of a convenience sample than anything else. It has a small sample size and covers only a small regional are. There are too many lurking variables to give it any real credit.

t5_2s7tt,sammew,1335225841,"All-purpose Flour  Shelf Life: for cabinet storage, up to 8 months if properly stored in a sealed container or if tightly wrapped, and for refrigerator storage, up to one year.   Amaranth Flour  Shelf Life: up to 6 months in the freezer if properly stored in a sealed container or if tightly wrapped.  Other Considerations: will not keep well if it is stored in a warm location or if it is exposed to sunlight. The flavor and aroma of amaranth flour will become bitter if it is stored improperly or for an excessively long period.   Barley Flour  Shelf Life: up to 4 months in the freezer in a sealed container or if tightly wrapped. The flour has a short shelf life when stored in a cabinet.  Bread Flour    Shelf Life: several months in a cool, dry cabinet when stored in a sealed container or if tightly wrapped, and up to one year in the freezer.  Brown Rice Flour    Shelf Life: 4 to 5 months when stored in the refrigerator and up to one year in the freezer when stored in a sealed container or if tightly wrapped.  Other Considerations: has a high oil content (because of the bran and germ), which causes it to become rancid if stored improperly or if stored for an excessive length of time.  Buckwheat Flour    Shelf Life: up to 2 to 3 months in the refrigerator and for 6 months or longer in the freezer in a sealed container or if tightly wrapped.  Corn Flour    Shelf Life: up to one year in a cool, dark cabinet if properly stored in a sealed container or if tightly wrapped. The shelf life increases if the flour is stored in the freezer.  Flaxseed Meal/Flour    Shelf Life: 2 or 3 months if properly stored in a cool, dry cabinet in an airtight container that does not permit light to pass through. It will keep 6 months in the freezer.  Other Considerations: exposure to light will deteriorate the effectiveness of the omega-3 fatty acids in the flaxseed meal/flour, which are so effective in reducing cholesterol. When shopping for flaxseed meal/flour, look for packages that protect it from exposure to light.  Job's Tears Flour    Shelf Life: several months in the refrigerator and 6 months or more in the freezer if properly stored in a sealed container or if tightly wrapped.  Kamut¬Æ Flour    Shelf Life: up to one year freezer storage if properly stored in a sealed container or if tightly wrapped.  Other Considerations: whole-grain Kamut flour usually lasts longer than whole-grain wheat flour because it has a lower moisture content than wheat.  Masa Harina    Shelf Life: about one year if properly stored in a sealed container or if tightly wrapped in the freezer. It will keep several months in a cool, dry cabinet.  Millet Flour    Shelf Life: millet flour will keep for about 2 months in the refrigerator and 6 months or longer in the freezer. The flour should be tightly wrapped for refrigerator or freezer storage. A completely filled and sealed glass jar also works well for refrigerator storage.  Other Considerations: can become rancid quite rapidly if it is not properly stored. It is usually best to grind millet as needed to ensure the best flavor.  Oat Four    Shelf Life: up to 3 months cabinet storage if stored in sealed containers or if tightly wrapped and up to 6 months if stored in the freezer.  Quinoa Flour    Shelf Life: 4 to 6 months in the freezer if stored in sealed containers or if tightly wrapped.  Rye Flour    Shelf Life: whole-grain rye flour should be stored in the refrigerator, tightly wrapped or in an airtight container, where it will keep for several months. It will keep in the freezer for up to a half-year.  Other Considerations: If stored properly, rye flour with the germ removed will keep for longer periods than whole-grain rye flour.  Sorghum Flour    Shelf Life: 4 months freezer storage if properly stored in sealed containers or if tightly wrapped.  Soy Flour    Shelf Life: 5 to 7 months if properly stored, tightly wrapped or tightly sealed plastic or glass containers. The refrigerator or freezer are the best locations for storage.  Other Considerations: full-fat versions of soy flour do not keep as long as the fat-free versions.  Spelt Flour    Shelf Life: if stored in sealed containers or if tightly wrapped, spelt flour will keep for several months in a cool, dry cabinet and 6 to 12 months in the freezer.  Teff Flour    Shelf Life: when stored in tightly sealed containers or if tightly wrapped, teff flour will keep for 4 months in the freezer.  White Rice Flour    Shelf Life: when properly stored, in a tightly covered container in a cool dry location, white rice flour may last indefinitely.  Whole-Wheat Flour    Shelf Life: 6 months to one year in the freezer if stored in tightly sealed plastic containers or if tightly wrapped. It will keep for only a few months if stored in a cabinet.",¬Æ

Start with a hook that makes the reader want to read the essay, not just skim over it.  After that, just say what the essay is about, history/backstory of the movie/book, and tell them what you're gonna explain in the body paragraph, but don't go into too much detail or repeat your body paragraph.     In the body paragraph, pick two of the questions and write about them.  For the end of the body paragraph, try to relate the two questions/how they affect or influence your views/how your views affect the answer to the question/etc. (This should be the longest paragraph: like 12 sentences.)   In the conclusion, tell them what you have just explained in the body paragraph, but with more thought-provoking stuff about philosophy or relating it to today.  End with a clincher sentence that ties everything together.  Remember to use good transitions from paragraph to paragraph.  Try to make the transition sentence have something in common with the last sentence from the other paragraph.  If you didn't read the book, use sparknotes to get the gist and go from there.   The questions I would go with so you don't have to know too much about the book: ‚ô¶ How is the main character developed? ‚ô¶ Describe one memorable scene from the book.

I'm German myself and played a lot of WWII games in which I have to shoot ""Germans"". For me, they're basicly just ""the bad guys"", so I don't give a crap if I'm shooting at Wehrmacht Soldiers or Mutant Vegetables from Schlockrok-5 or Orks or Ninjapirates. They are targets and if I don't shot them I'll gonna have to look at a loading scren.   I don't percieve them as Germans, or Russians, or Arabs or whoever the evil guys are. I know from first-hand experience that those are not depiction of real people but cutout placeholders with a simple AI routine that sometimes runs into walls.

Btw. That the Germans speak bad German created a very strange situation when in the German dub of the games the Germans were speaking with those thick accent and bad pronunciation and the Americans were speaking perfect German. Most extreme case of this was in the first Cod during the undercover mission in which Cpt. Price tells you that you should keep your mouth shut and let him do the speaking, since his German *would be better than yours*, while speaking German with you all the time. But as soon as he started talking with the German Officer, Price starts to speak relatively bad German. The same language he was speaking perfectly up until this point. After you two are alone again, he then tells you ""I think they bought it""...in perfect German again.

Certainly North Koreans and South Koreans don't call their countries ""North Korea"" and ""South Korea"" - they're ""Democratic People's Republic of Korea"" and ""The Republic of Korea."" So they're kind of fighting over the title of ""Korea,"" and that might be the case with their language, too.   The cool thing about language though, is that after awhile everyone just kind of forgets stuff. Take Pennsylvanian Dutch, for example. The language isn't actually Dutch, it's an old German dialect - called *Deitsch* in Pennsylvanian Dutch (the German word for ""German"" is *Deutsch*, and Pennsylvanian Dutch is a dialect of German, so *Deutsch* and *Deitsch* are related words). Everyone today is completely unaware of this, but once upon a time, the similarities between the *Deutsch* language and the *Deitsch* dialect were totally obvious. It just took a giant upheaval of immigration to the States and several centuries for those two languages to get separated.  [Right now](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_language#Names), South Koreans refer to their language as *[Hangugeo](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%ED%95%9C%EA%B5%AD%EC%96%B4)*, and North Koreans as *[Chos≈ènmal](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%EC%A1%B0%EC%84%A0%EB%A7%90)*. [Both *Hanguk* and *Chos≈èn/Joseon* are names for Korea](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Names_of_Korea#Ancient_history), and ""-*eo*"" and ""-*mal*"" both mean ""language"" or ""speech"" in Korean, but this knowledge may fade away over time, and those two words might become completely separate.  Again, only really time will tell. It may be that North Korea crumbles, and they're united again under one common language. Or, North Korea may continue to isolate itself - but to what extent, it's uncertain. North Koreans will continue to get access to ""standard"" Korean through their Dear Leader, but what they speak at home may become completely non-standard. We'll have to check back in a couple of centuries.  (Boy, I've just gone all wall-o'-text on this thread. Sorry! I get excited about language... ‚ò∫)",‚ò∫

""The Collection Under Abu Bakr  Henceforth the traditional account becomes more and more confused; in fact there is no one tradition but several incompatible ones. According to one tradition, during Abu Bakr√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s brief caliphate (632-634), √¢‚Ç¨ÀúUmar, who himself was to succeed to the caliphate in 634, became worried at the fact that so many Muslims who had known the Koran by heart were killed during the Battle of Yamama, in Central Arabia. There was a real danger that parts of the Koran would be irretrievably lost unless a collection of the Koran was made before more of those who knew this or that part of the Koran by heart were killed. Abu Bakr eventually gave his consent to such a project, and asked Zayd ibn Thabit, the former secretary of the Prophet, to undertake this daunting task. So Zayd proceeded to collect the Koran ""from pieces of papyrus, flat stones, palm leaves, shoulder blades and ribs of animals, pieces of leather and wooden boards, as well as from the hearts of men."" Zayd then copied out what he had collected on sheets or leaves (Arabic, suhuf). Once complete, the Koran was handed over to Abu Bakr, and on his death passed to √¢‚Ç¨ÀúUmar, and upon his death passed to √¢‚Ç¨ÀúUmar√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s daughter, Hafsa.""  ",‚Ñ¢

The sun stopped in the middle of the sky and delayed going down about a full day.  &gt;OK, apparently, God wanted to let the army of a small Levantine state finish off some folks who really pissed them off, so he did the Israelites the favor of giving them enough light to complete their slaughter and not let any dirty Amorites get away. But instead of sending down his trusty Pillar of Fire‚Ñ¢, he decided to do something really flashy and stop the freaking Earth in its rotation instantaneously. For good measure, he froze the moon's orbit as well, although I have no idea why anygod would bother with such a tiny rock. Maybe he just didn't like the tides. Anyways, this would normally mean a catastrophic acceleration of everything on the surface of the earth to up to 1000 mph east (at the Equator), but our thoughtful god had enough foresight to not inconvenience and kill everyone with his abetment of Joshua's slaughter of the Amonites. *Some supernatural power (I like to think the angelic souls of every failed zygote and miscarried embryo) was sent down to earth to hold everything on earth down with a westward counterforce of appropriate strength.* The weaker ones nudged the penguins of Antarctica and the polar bears of the Arctic, and the stronger ones subjected every monkey of Equador to a bodyweight x 1000mph/moment force.  &gt;In any case, this endeavor was several degrees of magnitude more awesome than *anything* attested in the gospels. I wonder why the miracles performed by the savior of all humanity were so comparatively tepid.

The transaxle is conventional in the use of hydraulically applied clutches to shift a planetary gear train. However, it uses electronics to control virtually all other functions. The following components are serviceable in the vehicle: valve body assembly, solenoid pack, manual valve lever position sensor, input and output speed sensors, transfer chain and sprockets, short (right side ) stub shaft seal and the long (left side ) stub shaft and ball bearing. Note that the factory recommends that before attempting any repair on the 42LE 4-speed automatic transaxle, always check for proper shift linkage adjustment. Also check for diagnostic trouble codes with the Chrysler DRB scan tool (or equivalent). Use Mopar¬Æ Type 7176 Automatic Transmission Fluid only. Do NOT substitute transaxle fluid. If the differential sump requires fluid, use 80W-90 petroleum based Hypoid gear lubricant. The transaxle can be removed without removing the engine. Use the following procedure. Disconnect negative battery cable. Remove the engine air inlet tube. The crankshaft position sensor is located on the upper right side of the transaxle bell housing. Unplug the crankshaft position sensor connector and remove sensor. Unplug the transaxle wiring connector block located on the right shock tower. To free the connector from the harness, remove the wire ties. Raise and safely support the vehicle. Remove the front wheels. Remove the strut to steering knuckle bolts on both sides of the vehicle. Disconnect the tie-rod ends if required. Remove the Anti-lock Brake System (ABS) wheel speed sensor, if equipped. Remove the halfshafts from the transfer case by inserting a prybar between the halfshaft and the transaxle case and pry the shaft from the transaxle housing. Swing the shafts out of the way keeping the joints straight and suspend using wire. Be careful NOT to damage the halfshaft seals. Do NOT let the halfshafts or CV-joints hang unsupported. Internal joint damage may result if allowed to hang free. Remove the engine-to-transaxle brackets and the transaxle bell housing cover. Mark the driveplate to the torque converter and remove the torque converter bolts. The driveplate-to-torque converter bolts are NOT to be reused. Unbolt and remove the starter assembly from the bell housing and allow the starter motor to sit between the engine and the frame. Disconnect the oil cooler lines from the transaxle and plug to prevent excess fluid leakage. Remove the transaxle dipstick. Disconnect the gear selector cable from the transaxle. Disconnect the exhaust pipe from the exhaust manifold and position out of the way. If the clearance will NOT allow for transaxle removal, remove the exhaust system from the vehicle. Support the transaxle using a transmission jack. Raise the transaxle slightly to relieve the weight off the rear transaxle mount. Remove the engine-to-transaxle brackets and the transaxle mount through-bolt. Remove the rear crossmember mounting bolts. Pry the transaxle mount rearward to separate the mount from the transaxle. Remove the rear crossmember. Lower the rear of the transaxle to gain access to the bell housing bolts. Remove the bell housing bolts. Place a drain pan under the dipstick in the transaxle to catch transaxle fluid that will drain out of the case. Remove the dipstick tube from the transaxle and plug hole. Remove the engine-to-transaxle bolts and lower the transaxle from the vehicle. The driveplate-to-torque converter bolts and the driveplate-to-crankshaft bolts must NOT be reused. Install new bolts when ever these bolts are removed. Inspect the driveplate for cracks. If cracks are present, replace the driveplate.",¬Æ

t5_2qh1f,powerfox,1335324329,"Most DisplayPort outputs support the cheap adapters linked to above because they're actually capable of producing an HDMI or DVI signal. The adapter simply routes the signals to the correct pins on an HDMI or DVI connector. This is a compatibility mode supported by most output devices known as [DP++](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DisplayPort#Compatibility_with_HDMI.2C_DVI_and_VGA). DisplayPort inputs do not feature this compatibility and are only able to accept DisplayPort signals. HDMI and DVI outputs are usually only capable of outputting HDMI and DVI signals, as well as VGA on some devices. As a result, an active converter like the one I linked to is necessary for connecting an HDMI output to a DisplayPort input.  The product pages for the adapters from Monoprice all include a disclaimer like this: &gt; This device is not bi-directional.  It can only connect a Mini-DisplayPort source to an HDMI¬Æ display.  It will not work in reverse.  I have a Dell U2711, which has a DisplayPort input. The full 2560x1440 resolution is only supported using dual-link DVI or DisplayPort. DisplayPort is better than dual-link DVI for several reasons. The cables are much thinner and the connectors are smaller and easier to use. DisplayPort also supports audio, which allows me to connect my speakers to my monitor. This is useful for cable management reasons, but it also allows me to connect my 5.1 speakers to my Mac mini, which would normally require a USB sound card. I also have a Windows desktop that I regularly use. Having the speakers connected to the monitor allows me to switch computers by simply plugging the Mini DisplayPort cable into the one I want to use. I do have a Mac now, but I used DisplayPort before then because of the advantages it has over DVI.",¬Æ

t5_2qil9,ccp_manifest,1335364367,"Spaceship Murder Notifications  by CCP Punkturis (The title of this devblog actually originated with CSM Chair Seleene)  As you all know Team Super Friends has been working on the War Mechanics for Inferno. Part of that was to make a War Report as you have seen in this dev blog by CCP SoniClover. Clicking on a kill there and having the old blob of text killmail pop up made us a little bit sad. Super Friends don't like being sad so we decided to be awesome instead and give the killmails a facelift!  Besbin came up with the idea of calling killmails Kill Reports, which made me think ""what a great idea, why didn't I come up with it myself?"". It goes better with the War Report name and the killmails aren't mails anymore so that can be confusing too.  So from now on the killmails will be called Kill Reports; spread the word everybody!  As you can see in the screenshot below we decided to not reinvent the wheel but instead base our design on the design of various killboards roaming around the internet. Note that the ""Total Loss"" value should reflect actual market prices when this feature hits Tranquility.  Click to enlarge image: http://content.eveonline.com/www/newssystem/media/28103/1/KillReports_Blog.png  We tried to make the Kill Reports as interactive as we could so all of the pictures will open an info window on click and so will the bolded text links. The items in the fitting and content will all have a right click menu so you can show info on them, view market details or find in contracts. Dropped items are marked with a green background. Destroyed ones will just have the default background color.  Just to be cute, we added this nice little ""Steal Save Fitting"" feature that may come in handy when you want to cherish a nice fitting for life, or to mock someone later if it's a bad one.  This is still work in progress so note that the final version might not look exactly like this. We would love to get your feedback and ideas on how to make the Kill Reports even better. You will be able to test them yourselves when Inferno is deployed to Duality for testing (soon‚Ñ¢), but until then you can base your feedback on what you see here.  Because I know you guys too well then I figured the one question you all want to ask is ""Will we still be able to copy the kill information?"" The answer is: ""YES the Copy Kill Information is still available, unchanged"" ‚Äì and additionally the option will be available in the settings menu in the top left corner.

t5_2r9tk,Hiskitten,1335365867,"Humiliation is very subjective...means a lot of different things. There's the degrading part of it - but personally, i don't like that. There are many who do - and that's their different perspective of it. Like i said, very subjective.  But my Master explained humiliation is really the return of humility...it strips me of all my inhibitions and reservations and there are a LOT of ways He achieves that...  There are times He'll just point out to me the things i love having done to me, and that makes me blush, which He then points out to me, which makes me blush even more...etc. And yes, it turns me on emotionally as well as physically.  So talk about what humiliation means to you, and your Master...i don't think He means to degrade you, but He definitely enjoys putting you in touch with that basic part of your psyche that helps you get into a deeply submissive mindset.

t5_2sml9,irregardless,1335370870,"&gt;Ideologically, the two sides were not diametrically opposed.  This is a bit of an oversimplification in that it ignores how hard FDR had to fight to get New Deal measures passed and how often New Deal laws (especially early ones) were struck down or weakened by the Supreme Court. The New Deal reforms generated a lot of acrimony among the American capitalist class, who were ardently against any sort of socialistic reforms. So much so, some members of the class plotted a coup against FDR.  So while FDR and much of the Democratic Congress were open to reforms, there were many powerful interests in the American political-economic system that *were* ideologically opposed. There were even corporate advertisements in the 30s using fear of Bolsheviks as a selling tool (*Don't let Bolsheviks into your washroom. Use Scott‚Ñ¢ paper towels*).",‚Ñ¢

What I meant was, when atheists ridicule those who believe in something (but mostly Christians here) they should realize that this will not make believers (Christians) very happy, and they might be ostracized.  &gt;Also,I can't believe I have to say this, but /r/atheism isn't the atheist headquarters where we all get told what to believe.  That seems strange, because I've seen people saying ""I was a devout Christian but I've read two posts here and now I am a hardcore atheist"" (a bit of an exaggeration but you get the idea).  &gt;An atheist is someone who does not believe any god-claim. That's it. Atheism has no ideas about origins, morality, evolution, etc, except that they don't think a god was involved in any of them.  That is true in theory, but not in practice. With some exceptions, most atheists (at least the ones here) believe in quite a few common themes: 1. No god. 2. Evolution is 100% true 3. Big bang is most probably how the world started. 4. Dawkins is The True Prophet ‚Ñ¢ 5. Christians suck and they post stupid things on FB.  &gt;People attack atheists (the person,not the ideas), because there is really not much else to attack.

""...to increase the body‚Äôs core temperature..."" If it really does that, it is dangerous. A rise of core body temperature of even a 6 degrees Fahrenheit can cause brain damage.

If you lived in a video game world, which game would it be?  **[Answer](/r/IAmA/comments/ssh9y/_/c4gpw3w?context=1) (Gaijinworks):**  &gt; Klonoa.  Love that environment.  *****  **[Question](/r/IAmA/comments/ssh9y/_/c4gpk3y?context=1) (AdviceFromAPyro):**  &gt; Got any EGB swag? I'd love to get my hands on a poster or something.  **[Answer](/r/IAmA/comments/ssh9y/_/c4gpx2q?context=1) (Gaijinworks):**  &gt; Most of that's long gone, and what I do have left isn't ""extra"" so I wouldn't sell it.  All I have left is my Assassin's Case, a few posters, a couple phone cards, and a hand-painted cel used to make one of the animations in the game that the Japanese production staff gave me as a gift.  *****  **[Question](/r/IAmA/comments/ssh9y/_/c4goiu5?context=1) (Minifig81):**  &gt; The problem PTrowe, is, I live on disability. I live on 40$ after taxes, and I get a monthly stipend of 121$ for food (with food stamps) every month.  &gt;  &gt; Moving would cost 4-10 times more than what I'd ever be able to earn in a single month.  **[Answer](/r/IAmA/comments/ssh9y/_/c4gpy84?context=1) (Gaijinworks):**  &gt; If you're disabled, can you even have a job?  Wouldn't you lose your disability?  *****  **[Question](/r/IAmA/comments/ssh9y/_/c4goc5k?context=1) (infinitecandy):**  &gt; Ah thank you for the reply.  Well if it does come out know that it will be a Day 1 purchase!  **[Answer](/r/IAmA/comments/ssh9y/_/c4gpyq2?context=1) (Gaijinworks):**  &gt; We'll do our best.  Thanks for your support!  *****  **[Question](/r/IAmA/comments/ssh9y/_/c4gn4e9?context=1) (InYourHands):**  &gt; So Sony would not allow never before localized titles through the PS2 &amp;amp; PS1 Classics lines? That's actually really disappointing. Part of me hoped that without the disc manufacturing and shipping costs we could've seen a resurgence of games forgotten in Japan. &gt;  &gt; Would you happen to know if the lack of present day PS2 QA would prevent games localized only in Europe from getting a DD-only release?  **[Answer](/r/IAmA/comments/ssh9y/_/c4gq0hb?context=1) (Gaijinworks):**  &gt; If they went through QA anywhere in the world, they would be a candidate for emulated release, but if they required changes (Japanese-&amp;gt;English, for example) they would have to be re-QAed, and if there was no QA line for that platform, that's a problem.  There are a few territories that are still QAing PS2 titles (not the US, but elsewhere), and we're trying to see if we can use those QA lines for a US product, but it's a longshot.  We ARE trying, though.  Hang in there.  *****  **[Question](/r/IAmA/comments/ssh9y/_/c4gpzhy?context=1) (AudibleKnight):**  &gt; I don't really have a question, but as a huge fan of Working Designs, Lunar 1 + 2 (both Sega CD + PS1), Alundra, and Popful Mail I just wanted to thank you for your work in publishing some of my favorite games of all time.  **[Answer](/r/IAmA/comments/ssh9y/_/c4gq2j1?context=1) (Gaijinworks):**  &gt; Thank YOU!

Do you see a potential market there? &gt;  &gt; Also Popful Mail is one of my favourite JRPGs, so thanks for allowing me the chance to play it!  **[Answer](/r/IAmA/comments/ssh9y/_/c4gr4do?context=1) (Gaijinworks):**  &gt; Steam is a great platform.  They have been choosier about what games to allow on it, so that's still somewhat of a concern, but I personally only see it getting stronger as an outlet, so it's wise to consider it, for sure. &gt;  &gt; Popful Mail has so many great little bits in it, and the characters like Nuts Cracker are great.  I love it, too.  *****  **[Question](/r/IAmA/comments/ssh9y/_/c4grk2a?context=1) (delyoto):**  &gt; I wish I had seen this sooner.  I have loved the Lunar games since I was a child.  I know that when you were at Working Designs that you made a few references to a Lunar 3, was there any actual talks of creating another game in the series with Studio Alex or were those comments more of a speculative or PR nature?  Also, how do you feel about the Dark Scimitar?  **[Answer](/r/IAmA/comments/ssh9y/_/c4grv41?context=1) (Gaijinworks):**  &gt; What was supposed to be LUNAR 3 was started and stopped numerous times, then Studio Alex was killed and it became really hard for me to see how the next one could happen without its ""heart"". &gt;  &gt; I believe in the power of the Dark Scimitar.  Nothing that cool-looking could disappoint. ;)  *****  **[Question](/r/IAmA/comments/ssh9y/_/c4gruv7?context=1) (smokesteam):**  &gt; Hi Victor, havent spoken to you in *years*. Loved your work with the Sega CD and Saturn titles. Despite some of the fuss regarding the translations I thought you did a bang up job or localization. &gt;  &gt; Seems like you are still maintaining a console focus. I dont have a Sony thingie and probably wont ever buy another one, cant find my DS, but I do have an iPhone and do enjoy ports of the classic RPG games over to IOS. Any chance of you guys doing anything in that area?  **[Answer](/r/IAmA/comments/ssh9y/_/c4gs0vt?context=1) (Gaijinworks):**  &gt; Thanks for the compliments and support from the old days! &gt;  &gt; As long as you promise not to play it on the toilet, I'll see what I can do about iOS in the future.  The toilet should be a iphone-free zone.  *****  **[Question](/r/IAmA/comments/ssh9y/_/c4gt2nw?context=1) (Guild_Navigator):**  &gt; I don't know if it was Victor Ireland,but somebody from GA in an Gamespot interview said 10 years ago almost to the date that ""the die has been cast"". That Sony was going to be the perpetual new console champ and that Xbox ""will NEVER catch on"". &gt;  &gt; Oh how things have changed... Sorry guys,but you don't get a penny from me. Kickstarter is for American gaming only.  **[Answer](/r/IAmA/comments/ssh9y/_/c4gvr8f?context=1) (Gaijinworks):**  &gt; I didn't know stormfront.org members played video games.  *****  **[Question](/r/IAmA/comments/ssh9y/_/c4gtryj?context=1) (Armen80):**  &gt; Hello Victor and John, &gt;  &gt; I have been watching the kickstarter project and being a fan of former WD, I really hope that this will work out eventually. &gt; I had sent some artworks back then during the WD era and remember fondly these days, as well as the high quality packagings of LUNAR and Arc the Lad Collections. &gt;  &gt; I'm an animator/storyboarder, but also worked on indie games like Pier Solar for the Megadrive/MCD and Battlekid 2 for the famicom as cutscene director and character illustrator. &gt; Being a PCE and Lunar fan, I'm also doing a small demo of Lunar the SilverStar for the PCECD. &gt;  &gt; http://www.hostingpics.net/viewer.php?id=713301PCEsaithpreview.png &gt;  &gt; http://www.hostingpics.net/viewer.php?id=556543PCEWDCpreview.png &gt;  &gt; The end of WD also marked the end of an era. I really hope you will succeed and revive the passion that existed back in the old days. &gt;  &gt; Good luck, &gt;  &gt; A.M &gt;  &gt; PS : Still waiting for a localization of Tengai Makyou 2 and Cosmic Fantasy 3 for the PCE/virtual console :) &gt;   **[Answer](/r/IAmA/comments/ssh9y/_/c4gvryt?context=1) (Gaijinworks):**  &gt; Even if this KS doesn't fund, we'll continue on and release the game as Digital only as planned. Once the game is out, it will be an easier sell for the next installements since all of them are so much better than the frist. &gt;  &gt; I love Tengai and hope to do one eventually.  Dtto all the CF ones we didn't do.  *****  **[Question](/r/IAmA/comments/ssh9y/_/c4gvifo?context=1) (allcapsarelocked):**  &gt; You guys should have supported the Dreamcast.  Yeah I know it did not last long but you could have turned a profit on Dreamcast.   &gt;  &gt; Investing in the PS2 did not do you guys that well at all.  There was way to much competition from Square Soft at the time. &gt;  &gt; Also not supporting the XBOX was a big mistake.  XBOX uses would have liked to have a few good Japaneses, but you gave everything to the PS2. &gt;  &gt; Look at what happened Working Design is now dead. &gt;  &gt; And your Kickstarter Class of Heroes 2 Deluxe for the PSP¬Æ system is a joke bring that to a dead System now.  You should port it for iOS and Android.  **[Answer](/r/IAmA/comments/ssh9y/_/c4gvtcm?context=1) (Gaijinworks):**  &gt; If other publishers who were supporting Dreamcast were making little or no money, there's no way it would have been profitable for us.  Ditto XBOX - there just weren't many Japanese games at ALL to do because it wasn't popular in Japan (an understatement).   &gt;  &gt; It's much easier to run a video game company from a recliner with imaginary games and imaginary money.  *****  **[Question](/r/IAmA/comments/ssh9y/_/c4gt1bd?context=1) (Dustwhisper):**  &gt; Why has noone managed to create a good JRPG for Europe/US? I LOVE JRPGs but I always found them just a TEENY WHEENY bit too grindy at times, not to mention some of them have some serious mechanic flaws (Like in Blue Dragon where superduper great items might be found in a completely random corner of a rooftop in the desert without an inkling of a hint as to where it might be so it's buttonspam running into walls).  **[Answer](/r/IAmA/comments/ssh9y/_/c4gvv4e?context=1) (Gaijinworks):**  &gt; Actually, the general trend has been to make JRPGs easier, so they practically hold your hand and grinding isn't necessary.   Then at the other end, we have a divergence to ""old-skool"" games like Demon's/Dark Souls where they are mercilessly punishing if you're a careless player.  I personally am a fan of the middle ground to hard type JRPGs.  The hand-holding ones are just boring to me.  They might as well be visual novels.  *****  (continued below)",¬Æ

He came up with a small bundle. &gt; &gt;‚ÄúKaram?‚Äù Jarid said. &gt; &gt;Karam glanced at Lord Jarid, then lowered his eyes and began to tie a coin pouch at his waist. Halfway through, he stopped and laughed, then emptied it. The gold coins inside had melted into a single lump, like pig‚Äôs ears in a jar. Karam pocketed this, probably in case it transformed back eventually, though no man would take it as it was. He fished in the pouch and brought out a ring. The blood-red gemstone at the center was still good. ‚ÄúProbably won‚Äôt be enough to buy an apple, these days,‚Äù he muttered. &gt; &gt;‚ÄúI demand to know what you are doing.

No man will give you, or any member of your houses, shelter or succor for ten generations!‚Äù &gt; &gt;Bayrd looked back at the stone in his hand. Only one step left, the smoothing. A good spearhead needed some smoothing to be dangerous. He brought out another piece of granite he‚Äôd picked up for the purpose and carefully began scraping it along the side of the slate. &gt; &gt;Seems I remember this better than I‚Äôd expected, he thought to himself as Lord Jarid continued to rant. &gt; &gt;There was something powerful about crafting the spearhead. The simple act seemed to push back the gloom. There had been a shadow on Bayrd, and the rest of the camp, lately. As if...as if he couldn‚Äôt stand in the light no matter how he tried. The darkness was always there, weighing him down. He woke each morning feeling as if someone he‚Äôd loved had died the day before. &gt; &gt;It could crush you, that despair. Why would making a spearhead change that? You‚Äôre being a fool, Bayrd. It just seemed to him that the mere act of creating something‚Äîanything‚Äîfought back. That was one way to challenge...him. The one none of them spoke of. The one that they all knew was behind it, no matter what Lord Jarid said. &gt; &gt;Bayrd stood up. He‚Äôd want to do more smoothing later, but the spearhead actually looked pretty good. He raised his wooden spear haft‚Äîthe metal blade had fallen free when evil had struck the camp‚Äîand lashed the new spearhead in place, just as his pappil had taught him all those years ago. &gt; &gt;The other guards were looking at him. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll need more of those,‚Äù Morear said. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre willing.‚Äù &gt; &gt;Bayrd nodded. ‚ÄúOn our way out, we can stop by the hillside where I found the slate.‚Äù &gt; &gt;Jarid finally stopped yelling, his eyes wide in the torchlight. ‚ÄúNo. You are my personal guard. You will not defy me!‚Äù &gt; &gt;Jarid jumped for Bayrd, murder in his eyes, but Morear and Rosse caught the lord from behind. Rosse looked aghast at his own mutinous act, panic on his wide face. He didn‚Äôt let go, though. &gt; &gt;Bayrd fished a few things out from beside his bedroll. After that, he nodded to the others, and they joined him‚Äîeight men of Lord Jarid‚Äôs personal guard, dragging the sputtering lord himself through the remnants of camp. They passed smoldering fires and fallen tents, abandoned by men who were trailing out into the darkness in greater numbers now, heading north. Into the wind. &gt; &gt;At the edge of camp, Bayrd selected a nice, stout tree. He waved to the others, and they took the rope he‚Äôd fetched and tied Lord Jarid to the tree. The man sputtered until Morear gagged him with a handkerchief. &gt; &gt;Bayrd stepped in close. He tucked a waterskin into the crook of Jarid‚Äôs arm. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt struggle too much or you‚Äôll drop that, my lord. You should be able to push the gag off‚Äîit doesn‚Äôt look too tight‚Äîand angle the waterskin up to drink. Here, I‚Äôll take off the cap.‚Äù &gt; &gt;Jarid stared thunder at Bayrd. &gt; &gt;‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not about you, my Lord,‚Äù Bayrd said. ‚ÄúYou always treated my family well. But, here, we can‚Äôt have you following along and making life difficult. There‚Äôs just something that we need to do, and you‚Äôre stopping everyone from doing it. That isn‚Äôt right; I guess this isn‚Äôt either. Maybe someone should have said something earlier. Well, that‚Äôs done. Sometimes, you let the meat hang too long, and the entire haunch has to go. It‚Äôs just the way of things.‚Äù &gt; &gt;He nodded to the others, who ran off to gather things. He pointed Rosse toward the slate outcropping, which was nearby, and told him what to look for in good spearhead stone. &gt; &gt;He turned back to the struggling Lord Jarid. ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt witches, my Lord. This isn‚Äôt Elayne...I suppose I should call her the queen. Funny, thinking of a pretty young thing like that as queen. I‚Äôd rather have bounced her on my knee at an inn than bow to her, but Andor will need a ruler to follow to the Last Battle, and it isn‚Äôt your wife. We can‚Äôt fight anymore. I‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù &gt; &gt;Jarid sagged in his bonds, the anger seeming to bleed from him. He was weeping now. Odd thing to see, that. &gt; &gt;‚ÄúI‚Äôll tell people we pass‚Äîif we pass any‚Äîwhere you are,‚Äù Bayrd promised, ‚Äúand that you probably have some jewels on you. They might come for you. They might.‚Äù He hesitated. ‚ÄúYou shouldn‚Äôt have stood in the way. Everyone seems to know what is coming but you. The Dragon is reborn, old bonds are broken, old oaths done away with...and I‚Äôll be hanged before I let Andor march to the Last Battle without me.‚Äù &gt; &gt;Bayrd left, walking into the night, raising his new spear onto his shoulder. I have an oath older than the one to your family, anyway. An oath the Dragon himself couldn‚Äôt undo. It was an oath to the land. The stones were in his blood, and his blood in the stones of this Andor. &gt; &gt;Bayrd gathered the others and they left for the north. Behind them in the night, their lord whimpered, alone, as the ghosts began to move through camp. &gt; &gt; &gt;A Memory of Light copyright ¬© 2012 by The Bandersnatch Group, Inc.",¬©

t5_2qh2p,Dudesan,1335497434,"Remember, many Christians find it more comfortable to believe in a god who doesn't condone, command or commit murder, slavery, rape, child abuse, animal abuse, arson, torture, ritual mutilation, fratricide, patricide, matricide, infanticide, genocide, and so on than to believe in one who does. Unfortunately, since the Bible (Old Testamant and New) is pretty clear about Yahweh's position on these things, holding a belief in Loving Hippie Jesus‚Ñ¢ requires ignoring huge portions of it. Or just never reading it in the first place, which seems to be the most popular option.  Well, let's say what Jesus has to say about that:  &gt;‚ÄúDo not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished.  (Matthew 5:17-18, NIV)  Some Christians claim that his death and resurrection ""fulfill"" this. That is bullshit for one simple reason: last time I checked, Heaven and Earth haven't passed away.  Jesus also made his views on people ""picking and choosing"" quite clear:  &gt;[Jesus] answered them, ‚ÄúAnd why do you break God‚Äôs commandment because of your tradition? For God said:    *Honor your father and your mother;* and, *The one who speaks evil of father or mother must be put to death.*  &gt; But you say, ‚ÄòWhoever tells his father or mother, ‚ÄúWhatever benefit you might have received from me is a gift committed to the temple‚Äù‚Äî  he does not have to honor his father.‚Äô In this way, you have revoked God‚Äôs word because of your tradition. Hypocrites! Isaiah prophesied correctly about you when he said:    &gt;These people honor Me with their lips, but their heart is far from Me.  They worship Me in vain, teaching as doctrines the commands of men.‚Äù  (Matthew 15:3-9, NIV)   Looks like Jesus has quite a bit to say about people who ignore commandments, in fact. But maybe it's just Matthew?  &gt;It is easier for heaven and earth to disappear than for the least stroke of a pen to drop out of the Law.  (Luke 16:17, NIV)  Okay, so Jesus is a bust. Let's see what the Epistles have to say about the Mosaic Code:  &gt; If you really keep the royal law found in Scripture, ‚ÄúLove your neighbor as yourself,‚Äù you are doing right.  But if you show favoritism, you sin and are convicted by the law as lawbreakers. For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it.   (James 2:8-10, NIV)  &gt;All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness,  (2 Timothy 3:16)  &gt;Do we, then, nullify the law by this faith? Not at all! Rather, we uphold the law.  (Romans 3:31)  Well, shit.   This problem disappears quite quickly if you assert that most of the Bible is hogwash, and you only care about the good parts. If you prefer to cling to it as an inspired document, vague mutterings about ""context"" or about Jesus abolishing the old Law won't get you anywhere. ",‚Ñ¢

VT-d continues from the existing support for IA-32 (VT-x) and Itanium¬Æ processor (VT-i) virtualization adding new support for I/O-device virtualization. Intel VT-d can help end users improve security and reliability of the systems and also improve performance of I/O devices in virtualized environment.

Intel Trusted Execution Technology provides hardware-based mechanisms that help protect against software-based attacks and protects the confidentiality and integrity of data stored or created on the client PC. It does this by enabling an environment where applications can run within their own space, protected from all other software on the system. These capabilities provide the protection mechanisms, rooted in hardware, that are necessary to provide trust in the application's execution environment. In turn, this can help to protect vital data and processes from being compromised by malicious software running on the platform.

It's like his brain is stuck with the same mind frame as the early seasons. Every time he is asked (because, let's face it he rarely takes the initiative) about maps, he quotes maps from the first seasons. Every time they talk about units, he says something like: ""I don't know what the do now I know they were buffed/nerfed, I remember they used to do X. Even when they talk about builds, he doesn't know any modern builds (other than 1/1/1). I know he is supposed to be the play by play &amp; he is not supposed to be the one that gets into the strats &amp; builds, but he needs the bare minimum. Artosis needs someone to talk with, that understands &amp; builds off of what he says.

The thing is, Artosis wants to talk about the game &amp; he does, but every time he is stalls, all he gets from tasteless is the same old stuff like: ""Yeah you're totally right""/""Yeah I've just got nerd chills watching that""/""X really played well"" etc etc... &amp; then waits for the commercial.  The recent Artosis/wolf-Artosis/khaldor casts have made this painfully obvious. Artosis seems 100% more enthusiastic when he is casting with wolf/khaldor than with Tasteless &amp; that's without the awesome chemistry Tastosis has.

t5_2rz1w,Red_player,1335547706,"It's good that you're speedling expanding. I wouldn't recommend the gasless styles until you are at least in mid platinum. You simply can't rely on your opponents knowing what they are doing/going for FFE. I'll try to walk you through a speedling expand build I've been working on recently. I'll warn you that zvp is my worst matchup too though. :q  Wall of text incoming!  ---  Do a speedling expand (meaning get your gas and pool before expanding. I don't care about specific timings.).  **Dronescout at 14 supply**. Depending on what you see, (FFE or not), you're going to be doing one of 2 builds.  **If you scout him going FFE** with your dronescout, pull guys off gas at 100. Delay your second queen until your natural is up, take a third and drone to 7:00. At 7:00, make a roach warren, evo, 2 gas, and put guys back into your first gas. (it's ok to do this step earlier if you see him chronoboost his cybercore a lot)  **Scouting the followup to his FFE**: Check when he takes his gas in the natural. The more he takes, and the earlier he gets them, the more likely he is to do a tech heavy play like Stargates, DTs or blink stalkers.  Send an overlord scout into his main at around 7 minutes to see if he's making a lot of gateways (4+). If you don't see any gateways you know he's not doing any big gateway plays, and you should prepare for DTs or Stargates, unless you actually see him going for something else a robo.  ---  **If your dronescout sees a gateway and a cybercore.** Use your lings to find out what unit he makes after the zealot. If it's a stalker or another zealot, he is saving his gas for something else. Sac an overlord immediately to find out what. Also check for chronoboost on the cybercore, as that means a likely 4gate.  (To defend a 4 gate, you shouldn't go above 23 drones. Make some spines and pump lings like your life depended on it, because it does. Getting a roach warren doesn't hurt either.)  His expansion should be up by 6:30. If it isn't, you should *really* worry one base shenanigans. (I like making a round of lings at 30 supply if I'm not sure he is expanding. If he is, you can probably snipe a few sentries, and if he isn't, you just keep making lings.)  I like taking my third whenever I see him expanding. I think that is a good heuristic to follow, but others might disagree.  Poke into his natural every once in a while to check his army composition. Lots of sentries=low tech and probably defensive. If he's starting to make a lot of zealots and stalkers, you should prepare for an attack. If his sentry count was never very high to begin with, you should worry about some kind of tech. Again, send in an overlord at ~7:00.  You probably want to get your roach warren and upgrades a few minutes earlier against gateway expands, but I'm not sure about exact timings. Honestly, it's been a while since I played against a gateway expo. :s  ---  I'm a diamond player, so obviously you should take what I'm saying with a grain of salt. Anyways, I hope this helps.

I was ready to say that when we signed Carr and Pool. Then we also signed Connor, who I think has great potential if he stays healthy.

t5_2qh2p,boywithumbrella,1335576401,"&gt; OK, good: now look at the progress you've made.   Well, for one I made you go from indirectly implying we are idiots (""This *really* is not that hard to understand, people"") to outright swearing (""the *fucking conversation*""). Isn't that an achievement?   No, I do not think I committed non-sequitur in this conversation. Reason for that, first and foremost, is that I do not agree with you that the discussion you cut into is meaningless - that is only your opinion, which probably arises from the fact that you don't find the topic interesting. I tried pointing that out, but it apparently wasn't direct enough.   So I'll reiterate.   &gt; foster precise thinking   is what I very much want. However when I hear ""Semantics is just irritating"", or you suggesting ""If you think of the rainbow [this]... If you think of the rainbow [that]"" - that's where I see, that precise reasoning is definitely *not* taking place. For however irritating you might find it, but you use words to express yourself. Those words have meaning. What meaning that is and how you use it is semantics. Whether you like it or not, what you say is semantically loaded, and I can and will point out to you if I find you're wrong or I disagree with you. So, let's get to semantics.   Now if you would look up the word ""rainbow"" in a dictionary, the first (literal) definition of that word will be something along the lines of   &gt; rainbow |Ààre…™nb…ô ä| (noun) an arch of colours visible in the sky, caused by the refraction and dispersion of the sun's light by rain or other water droplets in the atmosphere. The colours of the rainbow are generally said to be red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet.   [in this case it's Oxford Dictionary of English 3rd edition ¬© 2010]   Now you'll see that the main definition of the word 'rainbow' will start with it being a visible arch. Most probably it will also be mentioned of what colours the rainbow consists. At this point (if thinking precisely) you should ask yourself - does the physical phenomenon it's describing only manifest in the form an arch? Does it consist of only the colours mentioned?   No, no it doesn't. What does is our perception of it. And the word for that perception is 'rainbow'. Quod erat demonstrandum ^( since you're so fond of latin )  Lastly,   &gt; a meaningful discussion of the underlying concepts.   if you want to discuss the underlying physical concepts of rainbow - why don't you go to r/AskScience instead? I really don't think it is more suited for r/atheism than semantics of perception.   .  post scriptum ^( hey look! more latin )   &gt; I'm the only one who's made a relevant point not asserted in the first two or three comments.   I get it, you need to prove yourself - and you did make a (valid) contribution, congratulations on that! But you have to understand, that even if you have the knowledge in the field of natural sciences to direct us ignorant people, not everybody does - and so we have to resort to humanitarian discussions instead, until you come along and enlighten us that what we're talking about is utterly meaningless. Forgive us, for we know not what we do... ",¬©

(Even then, kitchen scales are good things to have, you should get one if you don't have one already).  Also, are you in North America? You didn't specify.  Generally speaking, a digital scale is going to be better than a mechanical one in both precision and accuracy. I'd stick with digital. If you still can, return your current one. No point in keeping a product you're disappointed with.   [Consumer Reports](http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/index.htm) does reviews on bathroom scales. CR does good work. They refuse advertising from product manufacturers, to avoid the appearance of bias in their reviews. They've been around since the 1930s, and they're also behind [The Consumerist](http://consumerist.com/) blog. Their reviews aren't geared toward the enthusiast or high-end hobbyist, but they're great for general product reviews.  I bought a Taylor glass and chrome digital scale after seeing a favorable review of it in CR. I've been happy with it. Mind, CR may have changed or updated their product reviews since I purchased that scale.   In my opinion, checking Consumer Reports should be always be a component of the decision-making process before buying a product.  Two more things to keep in mind. First, your weight is going to fluctuate a lot over time. You probably already knew that. Just making sure. There was a post on Reddit, within the past few months, I think, of someone who weighed himself multiple times a day, for several days, and wrote down the numbers. The amount of variation was amazing. I wanted to find the post again and link you to it, but...I think the Reddit search function doesn't like me. Ever.   Secondly, while you're at it, get a skinfold caliper to measure your bodyfat percentage. That's the more important number. In terms of fitness, your weight without your body fat percentage is useless. The gold standard for finding your BF% is plethysmography--think the Bod Pod‚Ñ¢. Minus that, a simple, US$5.00 [skinfold caliper](http://www.amazon.com/Accu-Measure-Fitness-3000-Personal-Tester/dp/B000G7YW74) will get the job done. I've read that digital BF% meters, which use electrical current resistance, are not very reliable, especially because your level of hydration will skew the results. Skinfold calipers have their flaws, too, but if you learn how to use it well, and apply it consistently, it's best for tracking BF% changes over time. ",‚Ñ¢

He's been lucky against Barca playing a squad where Villa is out and there is no faith put in Pedro coupled with some ridiculous misses from Sanchez, Busquets and Fabregas. Lets not forget last season this manager was relegating West Brom. Avram Grant took Chelsea to a CL final, no-one wants him back.  A new manager is needed, and Roman wants a big name because he's Roman and he loves a pissing contest. What he needs is someone available right from the minute the league ends. He needs a manager that will regenerate the shit out of that squad but appease the egos in it. Chelseas spine has one good season left. He can keep it or sell it all off. Only managers available that will do that are Rafa but he'll demand too much control, Capello who won't regenerate, AVB who he didn't give enough time to anyway, Pep who having quit due to stress is unlikely to come to The Most Stressful Job In World Football‚Ñ¢.

t5_2qh2p,Geohump,1335651650,"former religious college attendee here, I have to disagree. The atheists are not being hypocrites when they pick out offensive Scriptures from the Bible to recite to Christians.  According to the Christians, God is perfect, and the Bible is the perfect word of God. Therefore there can be no errors, no mistakes, no imperfections in the Bible. When atheists pick out so much as one clearly false statement or line etc. in the Bible they are effectively voiding all claim to inerrancy of the Bible. And if the Bible is not inerrant, then it cannot be the word of God. If the Bible is not the word of God, then all the fundamentalist Christians, who are the mental equivalent of the fundamentalist Muslim jihadis, (who had a few hundred more years to become less violent, note what were Christian fundamentalist doing 300 to 400 years ago?), must give up their claims that the ""word of God"" (""the Bible"") must be followed explicitly.  So, when atheists produce these ""offensive statements"" by cherry picking from the Gospels or the Old Testament, or any part of the Bible, they are effectively poking holes in, and totally voiding, claims that the Bible is the word of God, which effectively destroys all all claims of Christian fundamentalists.  Note to fundamentalists: if any single part of something that is alleged to be perfect and be demonstrated to not be perfect or not be true, then the entire body of that which was alleged to be perfect, is corrupted and false.  At every point in human history, wherever there have been fundamentalists of any religion, they always turned out to be extremists, and they always turned out to be evil. If you are a fundamentalist Christian, you are an agent of Satan, not one of God's servants. Please read Revelations and find the verses of Scripture that say that the stars in the sky will fall to earth. Now go find an astronomy textbook, or even look in Wikipedia, and look up the weight of the sun, and the weight of the earth. It is not even remotely possible for any star much less all the stars in the sky, to ""fall"" to earth. Should any single star get anywhere near the Earth, it will shred the earth to bits just from the title forces before the to get anywhere near each other, and the disintegrating bits of the earth be sucked into the gravity field of the sun, and into the sun's body. Anything great science student with an interest in astronomy will tell you about this. Now imagine the several hundred million stars in the sky trying to get anywhere near the Earth at the same time. Earth's sun is rather tiny by galactic standards. There are stars out there in the galaxy that are larger than Earth's orbit around our sun. In other words if one of these stars I mentioned were placed in the position of our current Sun, the star would completely fill up the space inside the orbit of the earth. They are that big.  By the way this kind of information is elementary school science. here's one of the larger stars that we have discovered so far:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VY_Canis_Majoris   It is thought to be about 2000 times the size of our sun. Earth's orbit is 93,000,000 miles. This star is 870,000,000 miles in diameter, or almost 10 times wider than the Earth's orbit.  I find that particular script in Revelations to be quite a revelation.  http://bible.cc/revelation/6-13.htm    King James Bible (Cambridge Ed.) And the stars of heaven fell unto the earth,  New International Version (¬©1984) and the stars in the sky fell to earth  King James 2000 Bible (¬©2003) And the stars of heaven fell unto the earth ",¬©
t5_2r2jt,cleos,1335652958,"That was one study that I cited - that's not what the basis of ""there's no such thing as PMS"" is. On the second post, I cited another study that look at menstrual cycles and mood cycles and compared the moods of men, ovulating women, and nonovulating women (women using birth control) - all three groups demonstrated mood patterns, but the three groups were all similar. In another post, I cite (although without full citations, as that required me to flip to the back of the book and write them down) an additionally four studies relating to PMS (if you search for the name, year, and related key words you'll probably come up with it). It's not wise to look only at hormone-related studies for a wide range of reasons, in part because when hormone differences are found, their effects are usually quite small and, while statistically significant, are not always clinically so - and often moderated by social and psychological variables.  However, I went on ebsco and did a search for testosterone, menstrual cycle, and irritability:  &gt; Dougherty, D. M., Bjork, J. M., Moeller, F., &amp; Swann, A. C. (1997). The influence of menstrual-cycle phase on the relationship between testosterone and aggression. Physiology &amp; Behavior, 62(2), 431-435. doi:10.1016/S0031-9384(97)88991-  Plasma testosterone (T) and aggressive behavior were measured in 12 women (aged 18‚Äì39 yrs) with and without perimenstrual affective symptomatology (e.g., depression, irritability) during the menstrual, midfollicular, ovulatory, and premenstrual phases of the menstrual cycle. The Point Subtraction Aggression Paradigm¬© was used to quantify aggression. Ss had 2 response options: a point-maintained option (100 presses earned a point worth 10 cents) and an aggressive response option (10 presses ostensibly subtracted a point from a fictitious partner's counter). Ss were provoked by the periodic subtraction of a point that was attributed to the responding of a fictitious opponent. Although T increased during the ovulatory phase, aggressive response to provocation remained unchanged across the menstrual cycle. T did not differ between groups during any phase. A relationship between T and use of the aggressive response option was seen only during the midfollicular phase. These data suggest that the relationship in females between endogenous T and aggression is inconsistent, that self-report of perimenstrual symptomatology is a more consistent predictor of aggression across the menstrual cycle than is T, and that perimenstrual emotional symptomatology is not related to T levels.  The following study was conducted in Sweden:  Eriksson, E., Sundblad, C., Lisj√∂, P., &amp; Modigh, K. (1992). Serum levels of androgens are higher in women with premenstrual irritability and dysphoria than in controls. Psychoneuroendocrinology, 17(2-3), 195-204. doi:10.1016/0306-4530(92)90058-F  Serum levels of progesterone, total testosterone, free testosterone, androstendione, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate, 17-OH-progesterone (17-OHP), and sex hormone binding globulin were measured in the follicular phase, around ovulation, and in the luteal phase of 11 women with severe premenstrual irritability and dysphoria (PID) and in 11 age-matched controls with no premenstrual complaints. Serum levels of free testosterone were significantly higher in the Ss with premenstrual syndrome (PMS) than in the controls in the luteal phase, the follicular phase, and around ovulation. DHEA levels were significantly higher in the PMS Ss, as compared to controls, around ovulation, while 17-OHP levels were higher in the PMS women in the luteal phase. Androgens may be involved in the pathophysiology of PID  However, it's important to note that correlation does not equal causation, meaning that it could be the androgen change that leads to irritability, or it could be irritability that leads to the change in androgens. For example, in [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rtkte/iama_former_transgender_individual_who/c48y8aj) post I mention how hormones can be influenced by behaviors. I mentioned one study that found that testosterone increased depending on the outcome of a tennis game (win or loss) and how the players reacted to that loss. Another study I mentioned showed that testosterone increased for soccer players when they had a game that day.   ",¬©

t5_2ranw,agentlame,1335674721,"First thing, first: high school is a joke.  It is a complete joke.  It's a big fucking practical joke that is played on teenagers.  The social structure is a joke that teenagers play on one another, and the work structure is a joke played on teenagers by so-called 'adults'.  One of the things I love about the *It Gets Better Project* is that almost every video points-out that high school is a complete fucking joke.  Now, the bad news: your life--the real one, the one that matters--doesn't start for three more years.  More bad news: all the shit that you swear you'll never use, you will.  Not in on a day-to-day basis, but it'll all sit there, festering, collecting cobwebs until it's needed in the dumbest ways, at the dumbest times.  Often, the things you learn in high school don't matter in you work life, but your personal life.  You'll find yourself at a bar or in a coffee shop with friends talking about some dumb topic and you'll recall some stupid test, or textbook, or lecture and you'll have something to say about the topic.  High school topics matter in a way that's hard to explain... it's like a common denominator for adult social interaction.  That said, what ever you want to do in life, you will not learn about until your almost 20-years-old.  Sorry about that one.  If you really dislike this sport, fuck it.  It won't make or break you.  Seriously, fuck it.  There are plenty of extracurricular activities both look good on a college application, and don't involve mindless points and sweating.  Don't quit tomorrow; quit yesterday.  If nothing else, at least find a physical activity you're interested in.  Yeah, life is about the same shit, day in and day out... but, if you enjoy what you do and the people you do it with, it's not that bad.  Most of the time it's pretty damned good... but, your parents are right--in the wrong kind of way--high school isn't fun, it's just what you do between being innocent and being who you'll be.  That's really about it.  It will be some blur of nothingness, nobodies and making stupid choices.  And a few gems, here and there.  I don't know if any of that helps, but I can't say much more than hang in there; It Gets Better‚Ñ¢.   **EDIT**   Oh, and the world doesn't start at 6AM of you choose it not to.

t5_2txom,cabbagery,1335678704,"It seems to me that the 'purpose' of academic discussion is in line with the relentless pursuit of knowledge/truth. I see three emergent scenarios:  1. Those who have [access to] knowledge and/or truth provide it to those who do not. 2. Those who do not have [access to] knowledge and/or truth seek it from those who do. 3. Those who recognize that their own knowledge is limited seek to increase it.  As it turns out, every academic falls into category (3). Academic discussions, therefore, can satisfy up to two of the above *from every perspective*. This makes them highly efficient means of furthering the relentless pursuit of knowledge/truth, and presumably the most efficient means available at present.  More broadly, in the spirit of your own answer, I would say that in order to have an academic interest in a [particularly narrow] field, a person must first have some level of knowledge or interest in that field, which must meet some minimum threshold. To be interested in becoming a cardiologist, for example, a person must first have some available knowledge of anatomy and physiology. In some cases, a cursory familiarity will suffice, whereas in others it won't. It's hard to see how a person could think to become a Lego¬Æ Master Builder (yes, it's a real occupation) without first knowing that such a thing was even *possible*. Surely there are scientific fields which are sufficiently narrow in focus as to be analogous to the non-academic role of Master Builders (I struggle to think of any, but that's presumably because I'm sufficiently well-educated that I am minimally familiar with most fields).  This is all to say that education is crucial. It is the very thing which makes academic pursuits *possible*. If we value academic discussion, then we must value education, and if we truly desire to have the pursuit of knowledge/truth actually be *relentless*, then we must encourage education for *all humans*. This last claim falls nicely in line with the recognition that all academics fall into category (3) from above -- not only does every proper academic recognize that her knowledge is limited, but she recognizes that every other human stands a reasonable chance of increasing her knowledge, provided that they receive an education such that the possibility exists.",¬Æ

t5_2qh13,Lard_Baron,1335717761,"&gt;But I have a question for you. What should Israel do? Honestly.   Israel is the regional power.    It is the big mean dog, it has all that it wants, the land, military dominance over all its neighbours, trade, the coverage of the worlds only super power. So Israel wants to maintain the current status quo as is. Israel wants peace on its terms. Those who rule always do.  Palestinians do not place the same premium on peace the Israelis do. They have nothing. They have issues that need addressing, the right of return, the occupation of the West Bank, the annexation of Jerusalem, the economic shutdown of their areas. They see peace as surrender. This is why they keep firing rockets. They want justice and put that before peace. The ruled always do.  To get Peace the Israelis have to address issues they do not want to. Until Israel is prepared to do that, there will not be peace.   It can be done, The UK showed the way when it talked to the IRA with no pre-condtions. No, ""Edit the United Ireland part of your charter"" before we talk. The commander of the Londonderry IRA is now a UK member of parliament and Northern Ireland is still a part of the UK. The UK talked, split the IRA into factions and eventually a form of words was found to allow peace to flourish while keeping the option of one day their being a united Ireland.  The PLO was willing to change its charter and recognise Israel, didn't get them anywhere Hamas have offered to negative response  The solution to the problems obvious. All the peace plans are essentially the same. Clinton's Peace Plan, the Nusseiba-Ayalon Plan, the Saudi Peace Initiative, Bush√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s Road Map, Oslo, Taba summit are all pretty much the same.  They all include clear measures that Israel has to take in order to make peace:  1.Dismantle the settlements,     2.Withdraw its soldiers and civilians from the occupied territories,    3.Create a viable Palestinian state,      4.find a solution for the Palestinian refugees' right of return.       5.Find a way to guarantee Israeli security. Altho' I believe having nuke addresses that.      6.A creative way to reward Israel for giving up what it feels it has won in war. another $3B pa?       The problem is Israel refuses to go along with these plans. At some point, there will be an ""event"" and the talks will fail. developing new plans is a waste of time. Israel wants to keep the large chunks of the West Bank and all of Jerusalem  Israel has not dismantled a single settlement built there, and has never ceased to take Palestinian lands under the guise of security.  What should Israel do? they know  what needs to be done but do not want to do it. Why should they. They have everything. No one can force them to do the right thing.   &gt;This is what I hate about reddit. The oversimplification and rampant stupidity.

The dilemma with the melee thief is that he either does good damage (not amazing) and dies very quickly or he does awful damage and is very elusive.  I want to play my Thief as a bursty stealth motherfucker, but since the last beta they added a stealth cooldown. For 3 seconds after leaving stealth, you cannot stealth again.  I first had a build that had too much stealthing. Most of the abilities were useless since literally half the time you cannot stealth. So I toned down the stealth and spent points elsewhere for more damage.  There is a talent that makes crit chance while stealthed 50%. I thought it would add the crit. It does not. It literally makes your chance to crit 50%. At this point, I realized that my gear being setup for crit/power was entirely useless. I then swapped it for Power/Vit/Toughness, giving me 18k health.  All my power is from my build. All my survivability is from the trinket. I am no longer squishy and can crit Casters for 9k now.

t5_2qh13,nidarus,1335753576,"&gt; Do you think the Palestinians and people who worked to improve the land around Israel for hundreds of years deserve a place of their own also?  Technically, the Palestinians considered themselves part of the Arab nation, and if the Arabs won the 1948 war, they'd just be Southern Syrians or West Jordanians, not ""Palestinians"". Their nationality basically arose from the Israeli victory in 1948.   But I agree that now, they are a separate (if young) nation, and deserve the right to their own country. Luckily, that right was affirmed by every Israeli prime minister since Yitzhak Rabin.  And just FYI, talking about ""improving the land around Israel"" is irrelevant, and really hurts your case. Palestine was pretty much an Ottoman backwaters before the Jews came in. Just about every 1st-world feature in the area - modern ports, electricity, roads, cities, were built by the British or the Jews. Indeed, there's only a single city in all of Palestine/Israel established by Arabs - Ramlah.    &gt; I'm pretty sure I could move to Japan or Albania, but since I'm not one of God's Chosen People‚Ñ¢ I can't move to Israel.  This is absolutely not true. There is no law prohibiting non-Jewish citizens from gaining citizenship.

FYI, most concealed carry licensees wear their guns either in an INSIDE the waistband holster, with a loose garment over the grip (the only part visible), OR they wear it on a high, outside-the-waistband rig, and ensure their jacket or untucked shirt falls completely over the gun.

It's weird for him because he wants her, and it's weird for her because she knows that he wants her. Friendzone‚Ñ¢.  That said, it doesn't matter who's in the right. You don't want to make enemies with your roommate. He can fuck your shit up real good. So I'd advise to just let it phase out.
