t5_2qh2p,DJ_Tips,1330625194,"&gt;No, I did not say that. That might surprise you but I expected everyone here to have heard of Iraq and its WMDs (or the lack thereof). Are you saying I was wrong?  I still fail to see how the situation in Iraq is the fault of the individual soldiers and not our political leadership.  I then fail to see how the situation in Iraq can be applied to Afghanistan without any consideration for the circumstances in a way that allows you to make such blatantly unreasonable statements about the military as a whole.  Care to explain?  &gt;Oh my bias is very real and entirely acknowledged. I am biased against murder, maiming, theft and rape, all of which are the expectable results of war, to loosely paraphrase Judge Jackson at Nuremberg.  Yep.  War is hell, and it's heartbreaking.  The position you're presenting, which seems to be ""everyone in the military is either a murderer, rapist, thief, or accomplice to such and therefore should be treated as such"" fails on two points:  1.  It's not even remotely true, and presenting it as a reasonable position is laughable. 2.  It offers no alternative.  I'd love to see a day when armed conflict won't be necessary, but to even posit the idea at this point in history is naive and ridiculous.  &gt;That's so nice of you. I'm sure that makes it all up for that collateral damage. It gets me thinking; why don't we bring up all the good things defendants did in murder trials? That's gotta be good for something! ""See your Honor, I volunteered for 2 years in a soup kitchen, that should buy me AT LEAST a free manslaughter or a couple rapes.""  Oh, well.  If you put it that way, I'll just start feeling bad about all those things I did.  I got to watch firsthand as people's lives were improved, but because niczar thinks that I'm an accomplice to something I didn't do, I'll start hanging my head at the thought.  I shouldn't have oppressed those people with schools, food, and the ability to not be strung up in a soccer stadium for disagreeing with their government.  I didn't murder or rape anyone.  Nothing of the sort occurred within my unit of several hundred soldiers.  You're being extremely intellectually dishonest by suggesting that I or anyone else that had no part in these atrocities you're throwing around as convenient little talking points should feel responsible for them.  Remember, you generalized the entire military with your original statements.  If you'd care to modify those statements, now would be the time.  &gt;Well you're really swaying me over, here. See I used to think the Vietnam war was bad until I learned about all the farm supplies the US Air Force delivered there. They even took care of spraying it all over the place! See, no bad weeds anymore, courtesy of Uncle Sam and Agent Orange‚Ñ¢!****  This statement would actually be funny if it were some weird interpretation of Poe's Law based in a radical anti-war pundit, but as it stands it's just sad.  ""Well, those people had their lives improved, but you'd STILL BETTER FEEL BAD!!!""  &gt;You won't feel any embarrassment yourself as long as your state of denial holds. Maybe one day you'll wake up.  Please don't make assumptions about me.  I actually agree that the unbridled praise that goes on for the military at every opportunity is just a bit over the top.  I also agree that there exist a small portion of the people in the military that are sociopaths.  YOU, however, have taken this side of the coin to such an extreme conclusion that it's honestly a little hard to take you seriously.  You're just as far removed from reality as a flag-waving hillbilly spouting racial slurs against Muslims while advocating for ""glass parking lots"", just in the other direction.  I came to terms with what goes on over there a long time ago.  ""Denial"" is not a quality I'm currently speaking from, although I know it must make you feel very in charge and morally superior to claim as ""in denial"" anyone that doesn't care to buy your extreme viewpoints as cold hard fact.  That's also the ""go to"" tactic of people who like to claim that the moon landings were faked, just FYI.    Perhaps you should consider which color you'd really care to be calling the kettle.",‚Ñ¢

t5_2qxih,popnfresh7000,1330650129,"Suuuuure  Hi everyone,  Massively Multiplayer Online games are built around living, breathing worlds that are always evolving, and Star Wars‚Ñ¢: The Old Republic‚Ñ¢ is no different. In our upcoming Game Update 1.2, we‚Äôll be introducing a wide assortment of new features and content, while also introducing a number of improvements and changes to the in-game economy.  As we work to create a more player-driven economy, you can expect significant improvements to Crew skills, and an extension of Crew skill gameplay, such as item creation and research, into the Elder-Game content. You‚Äôll also see new items brought into the game, including new schematics, Legacy items, a new tier of Player vs Player and Player vs Environment weapons and armor, Legacy items, new schematics, and the ability to extract base-mods from purple items, as well as many other changes and improvements.  Weekly patch 1.1.5 (which is now on the Public Test Server) implements a number of changes in preparation of the upcoming Game Update, including the much requested removal of Light Side / Dark Side requirements on color crystals.  As it is expected when large scale changes are made to an economic system, enterprising players often find interesting opportunities to benefit from their knowledge about the changes beforehand (for example by studying test server patch notes).  With patch 1.1.5, we‚Äôve decided to embrace these economic entrepreneurs and even go a step further:  By publishing a series of rumors and stories that are coming in across both the Imperial and Republic news wires, we are providing all of you with advance knowledge about some of the things to come in the near future‚Ä¶  Korrealis Corporation, a family-owned personal transportation company based out of Balmorra, has announced that, in response to a sharp increase in customer complaints, all production of the ‚ÄòSovereign‚Äô, ‚ÄòPrince‚Äô, 'Baron' and 'Commander' speeder lines has been halted indefinitely. This announcement comes on the heels of the rumor that Tirsa Industrial Consortium has quietly ceased production of their less than successful 'Prime' model, which faced similar blowback.  Vehicle Vendors across the galaxy have been advised to clear out any remaining stock of these models, and many Vendors have begun offering steep discounts to entice potential customers. Collectors and investors may want to take note that the previous limitations governing the resale of some vehicles seem to have been lifted and are encouraged to use the opportunity to purchase these legacy vehicles while they are still available.  After several months of deliberation, the Republic Senate's Committee on Transportation and Public Safety has passed new regulations that, among other things, adjust the cost of speeder licenses. Once these regulations are signed by the Supreme Chancellor in the coming weeks, prices for Tier I and Tier II speeder licenses across the galaxy are expected to see a significant decline. To help offset the loss of revenue generated by these licenses, taxes on all models of Tier III speeders will be significantly increased once the new regulation takes effect.  Critics claim that the resolution will only add to the serious strain on the Republic‚Äôs finances, while others see this as a vain attempt to keep on pace with the Imperial Transportation Authority, which recently passed a similar law.  It‚Äôs been reported that Operatives of the Republic Strategic Intelligence Service have recovered several new variations of color crystal prototypes during a daring raid on a cutting edge Imperial Science Bureau outpost on Ilum. Among the items recovered are a number of rare, purple-hued color crystals, usually exclusive to Imperial-held worlds.  Republic scientists are confident that they will be able to reverse-engineer and potentially replicate the captured Imperial technology, including the color crystals, in a matter of weeks. While most of the prototypes are still being analyzed, it has been confirmed that the Imperial Science Bureau's ""Project Expertise"" at the Ilum outpost scored a major breakthrough in the crystal cutting process. While information on the new technology has been kept tightly guarded, we know that the process can create several variants of existing crystal colors which improve the crystal‚Äôs natural properties.  The seizure of this technology by the Strategic Intelligence Service has led to a race between the Sith Empire and Galactic Republic to mass produce the crystals. Advance shipments of these crystals have already been dispatched to their respective fleets for field testing, and both sides say that once they have cleared any safety concerns, and have finalized a safe and efficient means of mass distribution, the crystals will become available.  In related news, a very limited number of pure white color crystals have been recovered by a Hutt-sponsored expedition into uncharted space. As of today, small stocks of these extremely rare and expensive crystals have started to appear in Vendor stocks at the primary Imperial and Republic transportation hubs. With no new shipments expected for several months, those wealthy enough to afford these crystals may find themselves in possession of a highly sought-after collectable.

Some foreign countries are shitholes. If they don't have oil, you sell them weapons and even attempt to make the conflicts escalate via intelligence (yes, this has been leaked and talked about) so your corporations can make an even bigger profit.  If they do have oil, however, you:  - Claim that the situation is unacceptable for the poor people (even though you don't give a shit about neighbouring countries in similar situations). - Claim that you've come to make them free. - Bomb everything, substitute dictator by puppet fake democracy (not much worse than yours and that of most so-called democratic countries, though; most self-called democracies are actually plutocratic serial dictatorships with a single mostly irrelevant, manipulated and fucked up bipartidist voting every 4 years). - Give help to rebuild the country, which goes from Americans' personal pockets straight back to America's corporations which get the rebuild contracts, so you first destroy their infrastructure, then rebuild it, and in the process public money pulled from everyone's taxes ends up in the rich' pockets, as usual. - Get cheap oil in return for the help because you basically own those new governments. - Now your 5 MPG SUVs and pick-up trucks and your NASCAR tickets are cheaper, because cheap oil is a human right in the Land of the Free‚Ñ¢, YEEEAAHHHHHHH!  And this is all there is to American foreign relations, at least in the past 20 years.

t5_2qh03,EricTboneJackson,1330707207,"&gt; Many of us are heroes from an outside perspective. What the guy in the column doesn't understand is that nobody ever thinks they are a hero. That definition is based on the interpretation of others, never on your own.  There's a gap in this reasoning. That the hero doesn't think of himself as a hero doesn't mean there aren't objective criteria. Fundamentally, a hero is *selfless*, someone who makes some *personal sacrifice* to Do The Right Thing‚Ñ¢. Whether or not anyone -- the individual or outside observers -- identifies a person as hero, his actions are objectively heroic or they are not.  The OP is saying is that the ""outside perspective"" is mostly wrong, that the tales recounted as ""heroism"" are mostly accidents or PR distortion.  He may or not be right, but pointing out that it's outsiders who identify (or misidentify) heroes isn't not an argument for or against his claim. ",‚Ñ¢

t5_2qh03,BellaEpoca,1330720351,"&gt;I don't feel like giving up on gaming quite yet  Nobody is saying you have to give it up forever.  Think of it as a break. I honestly believe it's very *healthy* to take long breaks, mainly because of rehashed games that are just excuses to milk you for money, and it's a terrible habit the industry has right now (just look at MW yearly releases as a perfect example..).  Mass Effect 3 is coming out in a couple of days, perhaps you could take a break right now and play it a few months from now, after it's been properly patched.  It's a Bioware game after all, and you know how they *rush everything out the door* to meet deadlines and milk people for 1st-day DLC.   Personally, I just finished the New Vegas Ultimate Edition, and I *loved it*, but now I'm going on a break to take care of real life stuff, and I will come back to gaming to play Mass Effect 3 a few months from now, after it's been polished a bit, and hopefully down in price.  Once in a while, I like to play games from the SNES library, using an emulator.  I have about 800 roms I like to explore now and then.  I consider it proof that gaming will always be there waiting for you.  It's not going anywhere. ‚ô•",‚ô•

Also Skyward Sword would be a close second simply because the fact that they did an excellent job with Zelda's character. I'm not used to a Zelda who is actually ""likeable"" (I never hated her, just never thought she was all that...special). But Skyward Sword changed that.  Also, while Ocarina of Time was awesome for its time, and aged remarkably well, I feel it's basic story in comparison to SS's and TP's pushed it down the list.

t5_2stfn,bamfusername,1330784238,"I'm going to quote TMP on aggressive pyro play. While the popular way of playing pyro now is still largely defensive, a lot of pyros have difficulty transitioning to aggressive play, or have poor timing while attempting to do so.  You see, a while back, the way to play pyro was basically 'latch yourself to the pocket, spycheck and m2 projectiles'. And while there's nothing intrinsically wrong with this, the pyro *is* capable of engaging, harassing and poking at the other team.   If you think that this is your thing, try and play, for lack of better terms, like a longer leash secondary pocket, or a roamer on a short leash.   ---  TMP's tips on playing aggressively. ---  To play aggressively as pyro is to actively seek and force situations (IE Killing your opponents). To play defensively is to prevent your opponent from creating advantageous situations (IE Reflecting rockets from a sentry gun or spychecking).  I'll start by saying this. Playing purely offensive pyro can be just as bad (or others would call it worse) than playing purely defensive pyro. Either way both are bad. Actively just attempting kill after kill CAN work (And if it does that's probably the way to go!), just as sitting back and doing no damage but preventing some can be just as bad (Though if it works then that's a way to go!).  The idea behind playing an offensive pyro is to get an enemy into a tipping point where your aggression overwhelms him and he just dies. Those who understand pyro v pyro know how this can happen pretty well. Get an adequate advantage and then you can roll over your enemy. So the core idea is creating this advantage and understanding the tipping points of an aggressive style (which can be loadout dependent).  How do you do this? You poke. You flank. You patrol. You W+M1. It's all stylistic and situation dependent. If you encounter a scout around a corner, the aggressive way to take him out is to reach that tipping point to kill a scout close range and just kill him. If you encounter a heavy while being aggressive, you try to get him into a tipping point where you know you can kill him in by utilizing your advantages over him.  The beauty of this style is that the actions you can do in it can have immediate pressure effects and lead your opponents into doing certain things. Moving to get around you. Hunting you down. Forcing a soldier to fire rockets at you for his life! All of these are really REALLY applicable instances of pressure that you apply to your enemies by simply doing that: You're not simply confined to preventing action, you're actively causing enemy action. And you can even do this in a defensive stance, if you're simply pressuring them enough offensively to make them threatened.  The problems with the style come down to the fact that the tipping point is not exactly known. There's no set tipping point really for all situations to just run in there. It requires a lot more knowledge on what you can do. A person with good flamethrower understanding, very impressive flare aim, and higher retreat ability can poke heavies for longer and reach a tipping point easier, or potentially have a higher hp value on a target for their tipping point into aggression. There's also the fact that sometimes you can't physically reach that tipping point well, so to maintain aggression and get payoff, you have to die. This is common in suiciding for the medic. Also, if you have a default tipping point value, but you underperform (IE miss more often than you normally do), you're probably going to lose the clash.  Despite this, there are some major benefits to offensive oriented play. As a pyro, it's way way WAY easier for you to retreat than it is for you to advance on someone, so by playing aggressively, you gain the ability to punish overextending way harder than someone who is playing passively, while being able to potentially escape from more of your overextending yourself. The only class I can even say that it would be harder to retreat from than to aggress would be scout, and even then, the scout runs a major risk by aggressing a retreating pyro - simply because the pyro can just kill an overextended scout in a stupidly low amount of time. Since you're playing more into your opponent's front line as an offensive pyro then as a defensive pyro, you have more map to work with and more to transition into easily. An offensive pyro can relatively easily translate to a defensive pyro if the situation warrants it.  If you're going to try offensive pyroing, just go out and try it. Don't be afraid to die a lot, and try to learn some of those tipping points for situations. You can abuse so much more if you know more stuff, and the transitions from offense to defense are very easy to pull off, and if you can get down transitioning from offense to defense then people will really understand how powerful you are.  The most important thing to realize though is that sometimes you just can't play offensive pyro and get ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• done effectively, and that's fine.  ---  Also, a question:  Why the shotgun? Just curious. I've always liked the det/flare gun on upward. ",‚ô•
t5_2qh3s,RoundSparrow,1330784481,"I thought it was a good film. It gets at a truth that people don't articulate very well with each other.  Marriage and relationships is a big theme, starting with the 9 year old child.  Love, as a child to parents, or husband to wife - is paradoxical if not grasped in totality.  I feel that, in general, we have severely degraded our ability to discuss how complicated life is.  This has happened progressively - that we have become so entangled in outside reality - that we have lost sense of how complex we are inside.  Mythology played a key role in our ability to relate to this understanding, especially among the deeper thinkers {removing the rule systems of sociological function of mythology}.  You run right up against a paradox that this movie portrays. The totality of life ‚òØ - and how often the human mind favors structure - and not embracing the complexity of it all.  Marriage in western culture, choice marriage, is central to this expression. At the point of marriage, you are supposed to be a mature adult - and then you are promising a lifetime - what if that person turns out to be bipolar 2 years later?  True Love is a paradox that is supposed to overcome all that - all paths are valid, even if they may not seem to be equal.  In many ways, I find this movie complements well with similar underlying superior truth in *Melancholia* and *A Separation* - of course, few will watch any of these three films, and all benefit from multiple viewings, and well -- all paths are valid, and we have nobody to blame but our self.   The ending is very similar to *A Separation*   There are choices we do make - but in the end, the only real concern is not to get stuck on paradoxes - which are just evidence of our biological brains... sort of like a computer operating system with some know bugs - it's fine to explore them, but people in all classes and situations of life often stumble into them and get stuck in what we would consider a negative way.  This film creates a dialog... about the how Love is itself a cancel of paradox. True Love looks forward, pulls into change, and holding onto the past is not Love (like the woman who goes insane, holding onto the photograph, ignoring change).  Joseph Campbell is your go-to guy on understanding this film's theme... and how hard it is to teach it. I thought the film did a good job in the runtime.  It's not going to appeal to everyone, but it surely connects to some.",‚òØ

t5_2qtjz,bearbeam,1330817551,"Reflections on community, culture and conflict  St. James Episcopal Church (www.stjamesaustin.org) and St. Andrews Presbyterian Church (www.staopen.com) together sponsored a community event for Austin on Thursday, March 1, 2012 at 7:00PM.  The event was held at St. James, and donations went to benefit 5604 Manor, a progressive, community center.  The reader can go to www.thirdcoastactivist.org to see other upcoming presentations.    The headline of this blog was the theme of Ms. Sen's talk.  The presenter was Rinku Sen, the President and Executive Director of the Applied Research Center, publisher of Colorlines.com, an e-zine that contains stories about racism, immigration and other isms that surround us today.  Ms. Sen began her talk by telling about herself.  Her bi-racial came to the U.S. in 1975, and primarily lived in rural, small towns, at times being the only brown face there.  As she described it she lived in many Levitt-towns around America.  Growing up Rinku had one passionate goal: to be an American.  Rinku, like most small children, just wanted to belong and fit in.  When she went to college she reluctantly went to a rally on campus, motivated by a couple of her friends.  The rally and what happened after the rally, radically changed her perspective, because she saw the energy and resulting gains won on behalf of the movement with the university.  Confidently she said that some of the changes are still visible at the school  When asked later by this writer whether this was a major point in her seeing her place in the universe, she responded in the affirmative.   This writer observed Ms. Sen as a very intelligent person under pressure; this blogger has had a lot of public speaking experience, it's a very stressful role, and you have to collect your thoughts quickly and give your own best answer; Rinku did that very effectively and passionately; her effervescence is contagious.  Rinku then moved onto immigration issues. She pointed out three general stereotypes used about immigrants: terrorists, foreigners, and free loaders.  Stereotypes and labels are used to demonize large groups of people.  In short, it's the lazy man or woman's way of denial.  People, whether media journalists, the civilian in the street or politicians, use this tactic to stir up emotions, creating immigrants as straw women or men and the boogeyman behind the cellar door.  They become the puppet-masters that hide below and make the targeted people the 'strangers among us, who have come to take our stuff away.'  She told the story of Mamadou, an immigrant who helped organized restaurant workers after 911.  As Rinku told this story, this writer began to see in much greater clarity that racism always has a hierarchy, and the U.S. has based its collective institutes on a white-structured patriarchal hierarchy of oppression.  For example, as Rinku explained, in the restaurant business there are the up-front workers who are essentially white, have the most interactions with the patrons; they can naturally do this because they speak English whereas many immigrants don't; as a result the 'back of the restaurant workers' are on the steps of the hierarchical ladder.  Rinku mentioned that a friend had told her, ‚Äúrace makes any situation worse.‚Äù  Seems to this writer to be a very wise statement based on my own experience of being a perpetrator in the past, and what has observed since my own awakening to my Unaware Racism.  Mamadou was indeed a community activist and organizer and his group went up against a very wealthy man who owned seven restaurants in this community of New York City.  But he and his friends did something else‚Äîthey were also creating their own community, out of conflict, and that community grew strong because it had to look the conflict straight in the face.  As readers, I hope we are very proud about the accomplishments, and will stand in solidarity.  As she began to include her presentation, Rinku Sen explained her understanding of Racial Justice.  First, Racial Justice equals diversity, but it goes deeper than that‚Äîdiversity equals variety, thus a multiplicity of ethnicities and cultures.  In her mind there needs to be a distinction between Racial Justice and diversity.  Some would frame Racial Justice this way: it means equality but often includes the notion of sameness.  For most of us who are white, our standard is what we feel we have already have, which is our white privilege, and we continue to perpetuate the standard of ‚Äúrightness.‚Äù  Some of us don't have a clue, because we  feel threatened about this sort of stuff‚Äîit's just too messy and generates too much guilt.  Rinku demonstrated four levels of Racism: the first two are micro stages, and the last two are played out on macro levels: 1).  internalized individual biases; 2).  Interpersonal relationships‚Äîpower here makes a big difference; 3).  Institutional Racism‚Äîrules, policies and procedures within organizations, sub-systems, and systems; 4).  Structural‚Äîinteractions between systems.  These 4 levels or stages are not chronological, but when life is viewed through these lenses such as From Personal Prejudice To Institutional Inequality‚ÄîFrom Who's the Racist here, judgment mode To What's causing Racial Inequality Within this Context?  ¬© Christopher Bear-Beam March 2, 2012",¬©

With his recent practice in Korea and the changes to the group i think he can beat Darkforce, Kas, and Feast and then might take a series off Supernova or Real.   My Korean choice is MC of course...do i even need to explain?  2) The darkhorse of the event will be Nerchio. Looking at his group you can see it looks very daunting at first but i think Nerchio will make it out. From there it will just come down to if he is able to play well in tournament settings at Lan's.  3) Carmac...I'm just a young nerdling and have no access to a credit card/payment method for the pass.

t5_2rmpy,i_flip_sides,1330919881,"Very good overview, and adds a lot of color to SUPERSAIAYNPROLE's assertion.   &gt; **Sidebar** &gt; I am annoyed with people's (like SSP) tendency to turn nouns into proper nouns and start anthropomorphizing them. The Patriarchy‚Ñ¢ sounds like some secret shadow government. Let's make sure we understand exactly what it is - it's a general mindset and set of social norms that have emerged from thousands of years of male domination.  So, running with that train of thought, let's envision a world where child-rearing responsibilities are shared, and women and men both maintain interesting, fulfilling careers. Taking my life, for example, I routinely work 80+ hours a week, sometimes up to 100 hours, and rarely fewer than 65. When I'm leaving the house at 8AM and arriving home at 2 or 3 the following morning, when exactly am I supposed to pick up raising my child and let my wife go do *her* job? Or should I give up my high-paying career so we can both work to make less money, and with less sleep overall? I would venture a guess that most professionals are in a similar boat. Lawyers, doctors, executives, stock traders, and small business owners rarely work a regular 9-5. If I worked part time as a gas station attendant, however, I could work from 6AM to 1:30PM, and get home to take over child rearing while my wife went to work as a cashier at Wal-Mart from 3:00PM to 10:30PM. So it seems that 'shared' child-rearing responsibilities are going to require a massive upheaval in the way America does business, to let its most high performing people work 30 hour weeks so they can go home to babysit while their spouses go to work. Which is to say it's never going to happen. Of the couples I do know who both work and raise children, in all cases the children are basically raised by daycare or a nanny, which I think we can all agree is not an ideal child-rearing arrangement. And thus it appears that having one person dedicated to paying the bills while another stays home to do the childrearing is the most practical setup, economically speaking.  So now we get to the real problem, which is that - without putting too fine a point on it - diaper duty, cooking, and cleaning is not very fulfilling work. I know I prefer my interesting, complex, and often rewarding career to housework and babysitting. And don't get me wrong - running a household is *hard* work. I have nothing but the utmost respect for my wife, who busts her ass all day long to keep things running smoothly, and does a damn sight better job of it than I would. I also take pains to tell her that, as frequently as I can remember. I estimate her coupon-clipping and clearance shopping alone save us tens of thousands of dollars per year, which is essentially tax-free income. But the thing is, I wouldn't trade places with her in a million years. It's terrible, backbreaking, thankless, and often disgusting work. Sure, there are some guys who would prefer it, but I don't actually know any. Do you?  And so we get to the base of the equation - women aren't happy with their end of the bargain. They want the independence, respect, and authority that comes with being a breadwinner, but they still want to have children and families - they just want someone else to do the boring, thankless part. And, unfortunately, guys aren't really falling all over themselves to take up that mantle. They too enjoy their independence, respect, and authority.  So then is feminism's goal to make men more willing to change diapers and dust lampshades so that women have more opportunities to pursue their careers? If it is, it's a stupid goal. There's nothing in it for the men, no matter how many social norms you change. The problem isn't that homemaking isn't ""cool"" or ""manly."" It's that it's tedious, repetitive, punishing work with little tangible reward. Men managed to pawn that crap off onto women thousands of years ago so they could go hunting, and there's little chance that they want it back now.  Backing up a notch, should women be entitled to a larger share of the divorce settlement in light of the fact that they *are* seen as the default caregivers? Perhaps yes. But the right decision depends on a multitude of variables, and the courts *often* take an over-simplistic view of the matter, reasoning (perhaps not incorrectly) that the man can always earn more money, but the woman may have to live off the result of the settlement for the rest of her life.  And then there's the child support problem, which is (and this is where most people get confused) one of the few times where the court's primary role is *not* to administer justice, but to find someone - anyone - they can stick with the bill, so the state doesn't have to cover the tab. Fairness for the ""payer"" never enters the equation. Making matters worse, while the money is ostensibly for the child, the mother is often seen as the beneficiary. Everyone knows someone who knows someone who's baby momma spends the child support checks on clothes and makeup and feeds the kids stales cheerios. Regardless of whether or not this is representative of reality (it's not), it's a powerful mental image that sticks in the public consciousness.  Getting back to my original point, while egalitarianism sounds good on paper, rights for one group often come at some cost to another. For example, black folks are now free, and as a white man, I can no longer legally buy people. So now, if I want to grow cotton, I have to buy expensive equipment *and* pay people to run it. Similarly, rights for women will come at a cost to men. Socially, legally, and practically, men are going to have to give up some things they are accustomed to having so that women can have their turn. And, thus, feminism is about making women's lives better at the expense of men. Sometimes good men, who didn't do anything wrong. Arguing that feminism ""benefits men too"" is mostly hogwash. It doesn't benefit the vast majority of men. For most of us, it's going to mean a loss of power, privilege, and social standing that we're accustomed to having.  This is probably good and right, but you can expect there to be backlash. And that backlash is currently in the form of a loose-knit group who call themselves Men's Rights Advocates. Which is what my original point was.",‚Ñ¢

t5_2qkt4,Askura,1330962288,"Agreed.  Here's an example: http://www.premiermartialarts.com/ A McDojo.  **AGAINST THE MCDOJO:**  I trained at one of those when I was younger teen and while it gave me improved fitness the techniques I was being taught there never surpassed what I had previously learned elsewhere. Guards were flawed, techniques either unnecessary or impractical, and there was very little opportunity to apply what you were being taught beyond semi-contact points sparring.  You know what I found odd at the time? That I could keep pace with instructors during sparring and often one of the ""top"" instructors would stop me to tell me how I could improve after I kept breaking his guard and landing strikes. I just knew it was a way of buying recovery time and to break the flow of combat as they could then reposition themselves. Our teams fared fairly averagely in local competitions with only those who had trained elsewhere were doing well with a single exception. People would occasionally double grade (Or triple grade) which I thought was insane. Everywhere up to that point where I had trained, and since, either didn't have a belt process or had you train for a significant amount of time before you could grade.  The real kicker? Self defence moves that would lead to you dying rather rapidly. As opposed to teaching the patented run-the-fuck-away‚Ñ¢ they told you to stand your ground and not to show your back. Face up to them.  Even 16 year old me saw the sense in not attempting that.  **FOR THE MCDOJOS:**  I got pretty fit. For something that wasn't that effective it definitely gave me a really good cardio and fitness routine. The classes had that ""Let's all do our best!"" vibe which seemed to pour through to everyone. As the instructors were friendly and talkative it gave a good group atmosphere that everyone responded well to. People who were initially shy or suffering from low confidence soon started to open up and get really benefit from it. Everyone was really approachable and there were a lot of different classes so if you couldn't make the earlier ones or had to work late it didn't matter so much. As for that it wasn't just the fittest, most toughened, scary motherfuckers there. People of all ages, both genders, and even a few with disabilities felt welcome.    TL;DR: They get you fit but will probably get you dead. It's not a great trade off but you'll make a pretty corpse. ",‚Ñ¢

While looking for that I also noticed a little blurb about one of the features of the receiver ""Bluetooth (A2DP) compatibility with optional Yamaha Bluetooth¬Æ Wireless Audio Receiver YBA-10"" while I do not know exactly what that is referencing it sounds like you could purchase something to get bluetooth connectivity out of it.   I also just want to be clear that I am just going through the list of things that were already posted, I am not checking the prices and looking for alternatives. I am truly sorry but i don't have the time at the moment. Perhaps someone else could but if not I can help with what you already suggested.   I actually have a Harmony One and a Harmony 880, I don't think I could live without them now. Unfortunately the screen on the 880 was cracked when my son dropped a flashlight on it. It still works but that one isn't a touchscreen. The Harmony One is and I do keep that one in my theater and I am a little more careful with it. I have never had a charging issue with either, at some point Logitech started putting magnets on the back charging contacts so that they would always make contact. As long as I keep the dirt off the charge base and the contacts clean everything is okiedokie.   As far as amps/watts/ohms yes, I can't in good conscience ever say that someone can ignore it, however giving the equipment a once over everything looks ok. Someone can look deeper into it and give a better interpretation but I don't think you will have issues.   Oh, as far as android, the beauty of that platform is that there is probably a solution to your issue that could do what you want, and if not one could be made. I don't know of one off the top of my head that I could just recommend and feel comfortable about though. The Yamaha does have some sort of BlueTooth adapter available though, so who knows.

t5_2s3qj,plus,1330986386,"Few observations wrt search:  Your search algorithm is bogus.  When I search for ""Dawn of War"", I get things like ""Westward¬Æ IV: All Aboard"", presumably because the word ""war"" is in ""Westward"".  When searching for ""Deus ex"", I get ""Agricultural Simulator 2011: Extended Edition"", and a billion other results that have ""ex"" somewhere in their name.  Adding games from search is broken.  When I try to add ""Deus Ex: Human Revolution"" after searching for ""Deus"" (not ""Deus Ex"", because it creates so many incorrect results), I get ""No input file specified."" I suspect this is because adding games from the search page bungles the URL.  The URL for DX:HR from the search results is as follows:  http://steamcoin.com/index.php/games/add_to_cart/28050  But the link to add DX:HR by just navigating the list of games until I find it is this:  http://steamcoin.com/games/add_to_cart/28050  Which works, so I end up having to modify the add game URL every time I want to add something from search.  One last thing, you don't seem to have different versions of the same game.  For DX:HR, there is the standard edition and the ""Augmented edition"", which costs $10 more.  However, I see no way to buying the augmented edition.  For comparison, SteamCoin.net allows you to buy the augmented edition (but they have a much worse BTC:USD exchange rate, so I'm using your site).",¬Æ

t5_2t3ad,eclipseyue,1331009291,"[Continued]  Makai Kingdom - NIS is fun.  Another SRPG, some replayability if you want everything, has new game+ modes so it's easier at least.  Mana-Khemia: Alchemists of Al-Revis - Alchemy RPG with a good soundtrack and characters.  Turn based battle system, I believe it's a spin off of the Atelier Series.  Marc Ecko's Getting Up: Contents Under Pressure - Action Taggin'.  It's actually better than you'd think, but gets frustrating occasionally.  One section in particular.  Didn't get to play it all the way through, another game I could only ever rent.  Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance - Stealth action, play the first first.  You can play 3 before this as 3 is a prequel to the series, but I don't know why you would.  Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence - usual metal gear fare with a hunger system.  Yes the special edition is worth it.  Metal Slug Anthology - Metal Slug 1-6  Mister Mosquito - You play a moquito.  Guess what you do.  Monster Hunter - Grind fest pokemon, where instead of catching them you kill them all and wear 'em as hats.  And use 'em as swords.  Large monsters, not the friendliest series, and the online was ditched for MHTri for wii and the PSP games.  Slow burn though.  Odin Sphere - 2D side scroll rpg beat'em.  Five heroes but gets pretty repetetive and actually lags a bit.  Okage: Shadow King - RPG is all over this list.  A pretty funny game, but typical rpg fluff either way.  save twice otherwise you lose your save.  ≈åkami - Action zelda, with a painting mechanic that actually works pretty decently, has a wii version where instead of button smashing you waggle.  Great looking feudal japan game.  Oni - Rockstar, beat 'em up ghost in the shell game.  Not quite as awesome as ghost in the shell,  but still.  Onimusha: Warlords - 16th century samurai action game.    Onimusha 2: Samurai's Destiny - not as good as one might be passable.  Onimusha 3: Demon Siege - Not as bad as 2, as good as or better than 1.  Onimusha: Dawn of Dreams - I don't...ugh.  I don't know if I dislike this one or 2 more.  I mean they're still good games but it's like taking steps backwwards.  PaRappa the Rapper 2 - Rappin' dog.  Rhythm game that's pretty much the first, though I don't think the soundtracks as good.  Phantom Brave - Use anything you can pick up as a weapon.  Not a grid based strategy rpg for movement, so not like the other NIS games.  Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time - run on walls kill shit never die because REWIND.  Platformer action game that's pretty fun.  Prince of Persia: Warrior Within - better fighting worse platforming, better story than the first.  Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones - best unless you like story  Psi-Ops: The Mindgate Conspiracy - Action Psychic game.  Pick up soldiers. throw 'em into wall, make peoples heads explode, etc etc.  With your psychic powers.  Might actually have an ad supported free pc version and was a fun as fuck game, though pretty short as I remember it.  Radiata Stories - Loads of characters several endings, RPG fare.  Ratchet &amp; Clank - ridiculous platform shooting game.  whole trilogy is worth.  Ratchet &amp; Clank: Going Commando - see above. more stuff.  Ratchet &amp; Clank: Up Your Arsenal! - see above. more stuff and multiplayer.  Ratchet: Deadlocked - pretty much just shooter in this one, but still pretty fun.  Resident Evil Code: Veronica X - Claire and Chris was all I needed.  Also Wesker.  One of the only resident evils I like of the earlier series pre-4  Resident Evil 4 - terrible looking on this particular iteration, quicktime Resident Evil survival horror.  Red Faction - Shooter.  On mars.  Rogue Galaxy - Sci-fi rpg by the guys who did Dark Cloud.  Generic cast/plot, fuck load of side quests and games.  Action based combat, and character battle commands.  Romancing SaGa - Start with 8 characters weird random leveling mechanic, pretty open world once your characters opening is done.  A whole fucking load of systems and shit to try to understand.  Confusing as hell, but fun, but there's less complicated and better.  Rygar: The Legendary Adventure - Remake of the NES game, fight the titans with your bitchin' shield, precursor to the god of war type series of action adventure.  Second Sight - stealth shooter with psychic powers.  Really short.  Shadow Hearts - your main character is fucked up.  that aside an RPG where you can turn into demons.  Pretty solid game pretty dark, but 2 is better.  Battles have revolve a judgement ring timing thing which keeps you paying attention or else you'll get fucked.  Shadow Hearts: Covenant - sequel a little after the first game, with more ridiculous characters, more side quests.  Shadow Hearts: From the New World - Not as dark as the first two.  Pretty standard at this point otherwise.  Shadow of Destiny - Adventure game that was pretty underrated.  prevent your own death.  Shadow of the Colossus - 16 colossi to kill. that's it. you and them.  And they are fucking HUGE.  A mandatory game to me for the system.  Shin Megami Tensei: Digital Devil Saga - I don't know how to even keep all of these SMT games straight, so they're all sort of jumbled in your head.  Demons and RPG goodness, every one of them.  Shin Megami Tensei: Digital Devil Saga 2 - see above  Shin Megami Tensei: Nocturne - see above  Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 3 FES - see above  Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 4 - see above  Silent Hill 2 - not related to the first game, great in every respect.  And the only silent hill I actually liked. survival horror  Silent Hill 3 - sequel to the first standard survival horror fare.  Silent Hill 4: The Room - I think this was liked?  only included on the list because I can't actually remember.  which says a lot.  Sky Odyssey - flight sim where you search for measure.  Pretty fun.  SkyGunner - flight combat.  Ace combat but easier with a manga sort of aesthetic.  Controls are great, wish I actually had the game and again, didn't have to rent it.  Sly Cooper and the Thievius Raccoonus - Platformer, fun easy game with good humour.  Sly 2: Band of Thieves - not as good as the other ones but still pretty decent, and two other playable characters.  Sly 3: Honor Among Thieves - the best of the series with coop!  Sniper Elite - ""Realistic"" sniping sim.  Unforgiving, looks ugly, also on the pc.  Compensate for wind, Coriolis Effect and such on the latter difficulties.  Soul Calibur II - Only good soul calibur in my opinion.  Fighting game.  Soul Nomad - More SRPG more NIS games with a pretty good story.  SSX Tricky - Everyone who loves snowboarding loves it because of this game.  True facts.  Great game.  SSX3 - The one that everyone forgets but is better than Tricky.  Tricky was just more well known and played I think..  Star Ocean: Till the End of Time - Standard RPG that has a little bit of a slow grind.  Star Wars Battlefront II - Third person shooter, with classes, units and such.  Pretty great Star Wars game with huge battles.  Steambot Chronicles - RPG that lets you play good or eveil without having to choose via text like modern games.  Steampunk era, where you can do whatever you want really.  Has some technical issues.  Suikoden V - 108 characters, slow burn, RPG standard for the series.    Syphon Filter Dark Mirror - I feel like people don't even remember this series existed (Considering Omega Strain was the previous one it's not suprsinging)  No online which is sad from the psp version.  The Sword of Etheria - Hacknslach goodness again.  Air combos all over.  Tales of Legendia - Action RPG without super attacks or multiplayer.  A lacklsuter bit of the Tales series but still ok.  Tales of the Abyss - Action RPG, with a decent sized group, and has special moves unlike above.  Tenchu: Wrath of Heaven - Stealth.  You are a ninja.  TimeSplitters - FPS that people for some reason seem to have forgotten despite it being great along with its squel.  TimeSplitters 2 - Another fucking great FPS.    Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 - I love the regular skateboardan' of THPS1/2 but I still prefer 3 to this day.  Viewtiful Joe - platformer beat 'em up with video effect powers bullet time superspeed.  Viewtiful Joe 2 - two playable characters this time!  We ‚ô• Katamari - More of the same.  This is not a bad thing.  Wild ARMs 3 - I Wild West RPG, new game+.  This series is great up this game, and the wild west setting is awesome.  Xenosaga Episode I: Der Wille zur Macht - It's not Xenogears, but is a ""prequel"".  Cutscenes all over the fucking place, so if that's not your thing be wary. RPG, with a card game, wish it was xenogears.  Xenosaga Episode II: Jenseits von Gut und B√∂se - you only play it for the story.  Xenosaga Episode III: Also sprach Zarathustra - This ones at least fun again to play!  X-Men Legends - Squad based RPG where you play the x-men and have combos with your team.  Long ass load times, and the next one...

Starting from some sketches he had once made with TV broadcasting in mind, De Groot drew a contemporary sans serif family with subtle roundings on stems and corners.  However, as the roundings seemed to suffer under ClearType rendering, De Groot redesigned the font, taking out the rounded corners. When submitting the proposal to Microsoft, he sent along a sample of the original version, adding: ‚ÄòI like the look of it, but as you see these rounded tops look real ugly in ClearType; don‚Äôt choose this.‚Äô De Groot had in fact been critical of the ClearType rasterizer when he first saw it demonstrated. &gt; &gt;To his astonishment, Microsoft chose the rounded version. ‚ÄòAs I soon found out, the rasterizer had indeed improved, and rounded tops and bottoms could be rendered smoothly now.‚Äô &gt; &gt;Calibri‚Äôs proportions allow high impact in tightly set lines of big and small text alike.

You said you're computer illiterate and, despite the fact that it's not hard, it's definitely not a walk in the park if you don't know anything about computers.

There are some low points with dell that I've had but it's just been EASY.   You said you had the complete care plan. When you build a computer and something goes wrong, you have the scour the internet to find a solution and, judging by what you said, that might not be as easy for you as it is for others.

t5_2qh2p,Losgunn,1331083326,"The word ŒºŒπœÉŒµ·øñ in Greek translates to ""hates"". Sure, it can also mean ""detests"", depending on how how close in accuracy you want to get to the source material - that source material being Luke 14:26. Here it is in Greek:  Œµ·º¥ œÑŒπœÇ ·ºîœÅœáŒµœÑŒ±Œπ œÄœÅœåœÇ ŒºŒµ Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂ Œø·Ωê ŒºŒπœÉŒµ·øñ œÑ·Ω∏ŒΩ œÄŒ±œÑŒ≠œÅŒ± ·ºëŒ±œÖœÑŒø·ø¶ Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂ œÑ·Ω¥ŒΩ ŒºŒ∑œÑŒ≠œÅŒ± Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂ œÑ·Ω¥ŒΩ Œ≥œÖŒΩŒ±·øñŒ∫Œ± Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂ œÑ·Ω∞ œÑŒ≠Œ∫ŒΩŒ± Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂ œÑŒø·Ω∫œÇ ·ºÄŒ¥ŒµŒªœÜŒø·Ω∫œÇ Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂ œÑ·Ω∞œÇ ·ºÄŒ¥ŒµŒªœÜ·Ω∞œÇ ·ºîœÑŒπ œÑŒµ Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂ œÑ·Ω¥ŒΩ œàœÖœá·Ω¥ŒΩ ·ºëŒ±œÖœÑŒø·ø¶, Œø·Ωê Œ¥œçŒΩŒ±œÑŒ±Œπ Œµ·º∂ŒΩŒ±Œπ ŒºŒøœÖ ŒºŒ±Œ∏Œ∑œÑŒÆœÇ.  Remember, the word that translates to ""hate"" is ŒºŒπœÉŒµ·øñ. This word occurs seven times in the Bible, according to the Englishman's Concordance(besides Luke 14:26, it also appears in John 3:20, John 7:7, John 15:18, John 15:19, John 15:23, and 1 John 3:13), and all seven times it is translated as ""hate"", ""hates"", and ""hateth"" in the New American Standard, King James with Strong's Concordance, and Biblos Interlinear translations.   Luke 14:26 is most often quoted from the King James translation, which is ""If any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple."" To be fair, I thought I'd post this exact verse from some other available translations to see how they might differ, with the appropriate word bolded to show any differences.  **New International Version**  ""If anyone comes to me and does not **hate** his father and mother, his wife and children, his brothers and sisters‚Äîyes, even his own life‚Äîhe cannot be my disciple.""  **New Living Translation**  ""If you want to be my disciple, you must **hate** everyone else by comparison - your father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters - yes, even your own life. Otherwise, you cannot be my disciple.""  **English Standard Version**  ""If anyone comes to me and does not **hate** his own father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters, yes, and even his own life, he cannot be my disciple.""  **New American Standard**  ""If anyone comes to Me, and does not **hate** his own father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters, yes, and even his own life, he cannot be My disciple.""  **International Standard Version**  ""If anyone comes to me and does not **hate** his father, mother, wife, children, brothers, and sisters, as well as his own life, he can't be my disciple.""  **God's Word¬Æ Translation**  ""If people come to me and are not ready to **abandon** their fathers, mothers, wives, children, brothers, and sisters, as well as their own lives, they cannot be my disciples.""  You get the picture. Remember, this all stems from the word ŒºŒπœÉŒµ·øñ, which is literally translated as ""hate"". There are several translations that show that this word is nearly always translated to ""hate"", except for when it is translated to ""abandon"", which is not equivalent to ""love less"". Whether you choose to translate it as ""hate"" or as ""abandon"", neither means that you ""don't hate your family, you just love God MORE"". So take it easy on KylesMomIsABitch, because they probably knew this and just didn't feel like posting all of this info, or didn't have the time. I did, and I did, so you could have your evidence.

They determine their course of action based on their interpretation of the bible. Which leads to...  -The issue of not accepting blood transfusions, while part of the doctrine, is a personal responsibility that individuals cover with their physicians well before any emergency. This includes in some cases wearing bracelets that identify their wishes, highly detailed medical directives, and pre-screening their personal physicians for how they would handle medical emergencies. They only take an active position on this when a doctor refuses to honor their wishes and medical directives after already agreeing to do so. *(I know there's case law that can confirm this, but I'm not a lawyer.)*  This also inadvertently leads to an interesting observation: with a little planning, a lot of clear thinking and honest dialogue, none of the law-making or rhetoric is necessary, as this becomes an issue of personal culpability and responsibility instead of creating a need for government interference.

t5_2qh3l,WodniwTnuocsid,1331175016," As recommended by EFSA, an appropriate and relevant statistical analysis is crucial. It should follow the following series of steps, allowing the use of several methods depending on the questions raised:      ‚Ä¢ Obtaining and modeling the growth curves and feed consumption, assessed by non-linear regression, validation, and statistical comparisons in order to test if the curves are significantly different, thus taking into account individual variability. This necessitates the use of time series analysis, selection models, and non-parametric tests, Akaike Information Criteria and related methods. Water consumption should also be an important factor to follow-up and therefore better understand kidney and urine data.      ‚Ä¢ The study of dose-response predictions using non-linear regression should be the goal, but the only two doses generally used in these tests do not make it possible to evidence linearity as we indicated. Moreover, in the cases where there are not dose-related trends or relationships using the two doses mentioned, the absence of linear dose-response curves cannot be a reason to neglect the effects. For instance, as previously cited, U or J curves may be characteristic of endocrine effects [37], and spiky irregular curves may be detected in carcinogenesis.      ‚Ä¢ Simultaneous analysis of all observed variables: multivariate data analysis, principal component analysis, correlations analysis, factorial analysis and clustering      ‚Ä¢ Multivariate comparisons of the different variables: hypothesis testing, multiple ways ANOVA, MANOVA, and others to determinate if the groups differ relative to the different questions: specific GMO effect or diet effect per se. To evidence a detail, when comparing two mean values, SEM should be calculated to determine confidence intervals; however, SD have been used up to now by the company for MON863 and NK603 files for instance.      Apart from empirical curves in some instances, ANOVA and univariate hypothesis testing only the GMO effect, none of the other statistical approaches is currently used nor requested by the authorities.      **Human tests and post-market monitoring**     *For the record, it must be said that very few tests on humans have been carried out up to now. Moreover, epidemiological studies are not feasible in America, since there is no organized traceability of GMOs anywhere on the continent, where, by far, most of edible GMOs are cultivated (97%).* **As a consequence, a post-market monitoring (PMM) is offered to the population.** The Cartagena Biosafety Protocol identifying GMOs at the borders of a country has now been signed by over 150 countries, including the member states of the European Union. PMM may have some value in detecting unexpected adverse effects. It could therefore be considered as a routine need. This approach makes it possible to collect information related to risk management. It can be relied upon as a technique for monitoring adverse events or other health outcomes related to the consumption of GM plant-derived foods, provided that the Toxotest approach, together with the SSC method, should have already been applied. The PMM should be linked with the possibility of detecting allergenicity reactions to GMOs in routine medicine, thanks to the very same routine cutaneous tests that should be developed prior to large-scale commercialization. A screening of serum banks of patients with allergies could be also put forward in order to search for antibodies against the main GMOs and not only their transgenic proteins, since they may induce secondary allergenic metabolites in the plant not visible in the substantial equivalence study.      **The traceability of products from animals fed on GMOs is also crucial. The reason for this is because they can develop chronic diseases which are not utterly known today. Such possible diseases could be linked to the hepatorenal toxicity observed in some GMO-related cases (Table 1).**      **Moreover, labeling animals fed on GMOs is therefore necessary because some pesticide residues linked to GMOs could pass into the food chain and also because nobody would want to eat disabled or physiologically modified animals after long-term GMOs ingestion, even if pesticides residues or DNA fragments are not toxic nor transmitted by themselves.**      **Conclusion**     Transcriptomics, proteomics and other related methods are not ready yet for routine use in the laboratories, and moreover they may be inappropriate for studying toxicity in animals, and could not in any way replace in vivo studies with all the physiological and biochemical parameters that are measured with organs weight, appearance, and histology. By contrast, afterwards, new approaches could well help to explain pathological results or action mechanisms of pesticides present in the GM plants or GM-fed animals, if found.      To obtain the transparency of raw data (including rat blood analyses) for toxicological tests, maintained illegally confidential, is crucial. It has also become crucial to apply objective criteria of interpretation like the criteria described here: sex-specific side effects or non-linear ones. Such data can be put online on the EFSA website with a view to provide a fuller review to the wider scientific community, and in order to better inform the citizen to make biotechnologies more socially acceptable. Since fundamental research is published on a regular basis, it should be the same for this kind of applied research on long-term health effects, as suggested by the CE/2001/18 and the corresponding 1829/2003 regulations.      **We can conclude, from the regulatory tests performed today, that it is unacceptable to submit 500 million Europeans and several billions of consumers worldwide to the new pesticide GM-derived foods or feed, this being done without more controls (if any) than the only 3-month-long toxicological tests and using only one mammalian species, especially since there is growing evidence of concern (Tables 1 and 2).** This is why we propose to improve the protocol of the 90-day studies to 2-year studies with mature rats, using the Toxotest approach, which should be rendered obligatory, and including sexual hormones assessment too. The reproductive, developmental, and transgenerational studies should also be performed. The new SSC statistical method of analysis is proposed in addition. This should not be optional if the plant is designed to contain a pesticide (as it is the case for more than 99% of cultivated commercialized GMOs), whilst for others, depending on the inserted trait, a case-by-case approach in the method to study toxicity will be necessary.     ¬© 2011 S√©ralini et al; licensee Springer.

t5_2qhze,ieatfrosties,1331186932,"I applaud starbucks, peets, and the like for ushering the second wave coffee culture in the United States. But it's mainly thanks to the second wave culture that places like Intelligencia and stumptown was able to grow, making way for the new 3rd wave. People found out a few things:  1) Coffee beans don't have to be roasted to full city +, and that lighter roasts actually bring out various flavors that are unique per region.  2) Coffee can be roasted and sold locally in a well controlled, qualitative manner. Customers are given choices to what kind of beans they want, and how they wanted it roasted.  3) Fair trade isn't always what's beneficial for the coffee industry. Local shops and places that belong to co-ops can just cut the middle man and do direct trade with the farmers themselves. I belong to a forum in which we do group-buys directly from farmers.  Now, AS FOR standard freshness of beans, maybe you shouldn't pull shit out of your ass, because once beans are introduced to air (practically the minute the beans spill out of the roasting drum), there's no way to prevent the process of de-gassing.  No matter how fast starbucks claim to have their beans roasted, shipped across continent, and placed on the shelf for customers to buy - I doubt it'll ever come close to the quality and freshness of local roasters.  The purpose of the ""Flavorlock‚Ñ¢ bags"" is so that no outside odors can sneak into the bags to 'defile' what little taste those burnt beans have. I can do this fine with a reusuable $5 air-tight container I got from target.  Times have changed. Third wave coffee has introduced SO much more to what 'coffee culture' could be in the U.S. The reason I despise starbucks is that they are a stumbling block for 3rd wave coffee shops to become something more than just a 'snobbish' culture, and continue to imbue the idea that their coffee is a step above $1 gas-station coffee, but the best 'coffee' has to offer.",‚Ñ¢

t5_2sokd,michaelmacmanus,1331253520,"&gt; I can't stand altruistic, unrealistic liberalism  Funny.  To me the end game for true *current* libertarianism is also an unrealistic altruism with the invisible deity-like hand of the Free Market¬Æ guiding us to a utopia, or at the very least a Bentham-esque utilitarian society that benefits the most amount of people possible at all times.  It's interesting to note that as I started taking my econ classes - half my class population identified as Libertarian, with JMK being the ultimate evil.  I started around 08' - the first time Paul became seriously en vogue.  As I marched closer towards my degree that population swiftly dwindled as libertarianism - even from Friedman's standpoint - had drifted into a childlike fantasy.  Even Milton himself, the Jesus of libertarianism espoused virtues of having a government, supporting the lower class, and self identified as a ""classic liberal.""  Then along came Rand, Greenspan, and their ilk to morph libertarianism into some sort of caricature of what it originally entailed.  This seems to be what most self identifying right wing voters that claim libertarianism cling to.  This mutilated version of little to no government, blaming the left and the poor for their lot in life, and everything else that ails seems to have prevailed.    The far left think business can't be trusted.  The far right think government can't be trusted.  The center knows that no one can be trusted.  Hence you'll find the strongest nations in the world in terms of economic development and HDI ranking (Germany, Australia, Canada, Norway, United States, etc) directly in the center.  Strong corporations.  Strong social services.  The balancing act is just a lot trickier in the States since so much of the budget is devoted to the military - which unfortunately for the most part is a necessary evil to keep commerce as stable as it is in the world.  It's a difficult game and a constant balancing act.  Anyone that identifies as a specific party member or side and tries to form their ideology around that has simply given up attempting to learn.  That's why most young people start out liberal - because the social causes that progressives champion are so transparent in their good.  Why should people be persecuted based on sexual preference?  Why should we enforce laws based on xenophobia?  Why does this drug prohibition still exist when it's been proven time and again that it's a failure?  So they'll naturally cling to social economics as well because it's an expedient line of thought.  As you grow older you just want your money.   You become cynical and jaded and ultimately lackadaisical in your support of a better world.  You're no longer suckling at your parents teet so now money has taken on a tangible meaning to you. You just want what you feel is yours.  So you support policies that purport to have that interest - even if with a tiny bit of research and learning you can see how in reality they'll end up doing more harm than good.",¬Æ

As far as TJ models it would be a Sahara.

Again TJ model would be Rubicon.   It should be noted that I noticed a general attitude that if you are going to mod the Jeep to get a Sport or Sport S as it has a cheaper base price and most people who mod their Jeeps upgrade to the same level or better then what the Rubicon has.   Anyways, I am sure some one who has more knowledge then me will give a better answer.   Edit: Fixed some details about the Sahara, about the roof, still a IIRC though.   Edit 2: I'm not sure if this is what you were looking for going though it,   This is the main difference The tires, lift, whats included, and in the case of the Rubicon comes out of the factory ready for more advanced trails. The Sport and Sport S should be pretty basic rides and still will be capable, the Sahara is meant more for the driver who spends more time commuting then in the trail, the well the Rubicon is for the trail.    I personally own a 2000 SE, and I enjoy the heck out of it, it doesn't have anything fancy but still a fun ride, so don't let a lack of features discourage you from Sport or Sport S, if AC is a must, I think you can add AC to a Sport.  Also I would see if you could test drive a Jeep with a hard top and a soft top, the soft tops are more noisy but it's easier to take down for good weather, where as the hard tops are more quite you can use the freedom top for the front passenger and driver to get some fresh air in, and a bit more ""secure"" as far as what people need to do to break in (break glass opposed to just undoing a side panel)",¬Æ

t5_2rgny,EricTboneJackson,1331312908,"&gt; If you have such a an imagination then lets hear what you would have done different  Saying it's not a ""ridiculously huge change"" is not saying I would have done different. However, I can think of any number of changes that would have been bigger:  (1) Open the device. Add a jailbreak option, that perhaps voids your warranty but allows you to treat the device as a computer rather than an appliance for running Apps‚Ñ¢. This would creating an *explosion* in indie development for the device. Not plausible, never gonna happen, but ridiculously huge.  (2) Stop restricting the App store (smaller version of #1). Let competitors to Apple's products compete fairly on the platform, open it up to porn vendors, etc.  Ridiculously huge.  (3) Apple sanctioned and promoted support for game controllers, including the Xbox, Playstation and Wii controllers. This would be a ridiculously huge change for gamers.  (4) An SD card slot. Perhaps not ""ridiculously huge"", but at least it's a *functional* change, which expands the devices capability, rather than improving aesthetics in a minority of apps.  (5) Pressure sensitive, haptic screen, etc. -- functional changes that create entirely new classes of apps.  This is just rambling off the top of my head. I really haven't given the problem *any* thought. I'm sure if I did, I could come up with something cooler. My point is merely that changing the resolution of the screen -- however cool it is, however hard it was to pull off -- is *not* a ridiculously huge change.  &gt; cramming a greater than HD display into that size, powering and pushing those pixels is an amazing feat of engineering  ""Amazing feat of engineering"" does not make it a ""ridiculously huge change"".   Consider this: for many people, at more than a few feet away, there will be *no difference whatsoever*. All that engineering totally undetectable.  They could have reduced the battery to the size of a pinkie nail. That also would have been an ""amazing feat of engineering"", but again, unless it has some massive, incredible change in the function of the device, it's not a ""ridiculously huge change"".  &gt; No other company in the world is close to what apple just dropped  That's true, and it's awesome. That doesn't make it a ridiculously huge change. You're confusing metrics here.  &gt; haptic holographic 3d crap people seem to have been day dreaming and fantasising about  Crap? Holographic is mostly science fiction, glasses-free 3D is too problematic, but haptic is ready for prime time and it's not crap. I wouldn't be surprised to see it on Apple's next device, though *that* is such a ""ridiculously huge change"" that it could create iOS fragmentation issues for developers.  &gt; you would probably be on here complaining all they did was add a gimmicky marketing trick instead of focusing on real tech  Read this slowly and carefully: I'm not complaining about anything.  I'm just disagreeing with your characterization of an increase in resolution as a ""ridiculously huge change"".  &gt; Maybe I should rephrase - It's a huge tech upgrade over the iPad 2, and a huge upgrade over the rest of the market.  There you go. Totally agree with that.  &gt; I'm responding to the ""same shit with a better dipslay"" reaction it's getting in many circles  But... that's exactly what it is. o.O  Maybe if you tone down your inner fanboy a bit, you could reconcile *that* evaluation, which is objectively true, with *your* evaluation, which I also happen to agree with.

t5_2s7wq,smokebreaks,1331330612,"""Enjamin.."" He paused briefly, his stagnant eyes shooting to the neon-slainte signs that littered the restaurant and offered microscopic bits of culture to those without.  ""Enjamin.. Bay."" He finished, wiping the bit of sauce from his mouth that was left over from his 'blazin-bellicose-blowback-blarney-wings!‚Ñ¢'   Enjamin was engaging in his usual Thursday night hand-food catharsis at McNelty's.  His grubby little hands had picked many sampler plates clean and he had simply walked out every-time, crumbs clinging to his old Dallas Cowboys starter jacket.  But, tonight was different; a rather broad woman had approached him mid-feast and offered him a bit of company.  She had taken a seat in one of the many backless bar-stools that surrounded Enjamin's dominion and she was eager to know his secrets-  ""That's a rather.. pretty.. name."" She tripped over the pretty; too much social lubricant, too many 2.99$ Long Islands.  ""If you say so."" Enjamin replied coarsely, only after the silence carried on long enough for him to polish off his 13th wing.  ""My name is Angel."" She chirped- Enjamin had never asked.  ""That's fascinating."" He replied plaintively, immediately reaffirmed in his disblief of actual angels whilst scouting out what escape routes he'd have to take to lose this monolith of a woman.  ""What do you like to do for fun?"" She asked loudly with that custard-filled baritone.  ""I like to record episodes of Wheel of Fortune and then watch them over and over until every answer is knee-jerk."" Enjamin wasn't kidding, 2019 had been a rough year; he'd lost his job at the urinal-cake plant and he was certainly done with surprises of any kind.  ""I had a dream once that me and Pat Sajak went down to Branson, Missouri and lived like royalty!"" She replied immediately.  ""I, uhh..' Enjamin started weighing the pros and cons of the situation, physical attributes aside- it'd been four years since he'd felt flesh, sinewy or fluffly.  ""Pat and the Silver Dollar City.."" She spoke lushly, trailing off into visible quivers and aerating tugs at her heather-hued sweater.  ""You know you kind of look like Pat.."" She said with an ethanol fueled politeness.  It was fucking poetic when she heard herself say it.  Enjamin felt flattered for the first time in decades.  ""Why don't we take this conversation out of McNelty's? I'd like to know more."" Enjamin had decided the time was now; actions had to be taken.  It was then that the Air-Raid sirens boomed and were followed by a series of proximal clattering.  The Russians and their bombs had finally arrived.  The floor of McNelty's had a celestial pulse, each beat sent various novelties and white-bread artifacts bouncing about the room.  ""Angel!"" Enjamin screamed, it was the only name that came to mind.  It sounded so god-damn sweet.  It was then that a flower-pattern stained glass chandelier fell, promptly shattering on Enjamin's skull.  ""Pat!"" She yelled, too drunk to discern between game-show royalty and frumpy chain-restaurant dilettantes.  For a moment, he kept enough cognizance to see fulimation sweep the parking lot and various cars being turned over effortlessly by vaporous force.  Angel was swept up in something he couldn't make-out in his state; it must've been an explosion- love was dead, he was dying-  ""I should've ordered pizza for once."" He thought, right before oblivion kissed his cheek. ",‚Ñ¢

Not that I'm discrediting your entire argument, I agree with pretty much the rest of what you're saying, but since around 2004 pretty much, 4chan has been gradually discouraging any non-anonymous behavior. And it's funny cuz I've heard that exact argument before ON 4chan where people are like ""God reddit, way to take credit for something that isn't yours by removing the artist's watermarks"" and then the next thread down someone is posting some content they made with their watermark on it and it's all ""gtfo namefag, &gt;2012, &gt;using watermarks, ISHYGDDT"", etc.  And from that perspective it more sounds like it's Anonymous saying ""It's okay if WE do it, but no one else"".

If God didn't make us sick, then instead of staying home in bed, we would have went out on the same road as a drunk driver and gotten killed. God just made you sick to save your life. It almost makes sense until you consider the fact that ""God"" was the one who put that drunk driver there in the first place. Fucking convoluted ""logic""...  Edit: Someone posted it on Facebook again, so here it is:  &gt; Sometimes I ask God why did he let certain things happen. But, now I know, there's always was reason....  &gt;Me: God, can I ask You a question?  &gt;God: Sure.  &gt;Me: Promise You won't get mad?  &gt;God: I promise.  &gt;Me: Why did You let so much stuff happen to me today?  &gt;God: What do you mean?  &gt;Me: Well, I woke up late.  &gt;God: Yes  &gt;Me: My car took forever to start.  &gt;God: Okay.  &gt;Me: At lunch, they made my sandwich wrong &amp; I had to wait...  &gt;God: Hmmmmm.  &gt;Me: On the way home, my phone went DEAD, just as I picked up a call.  &gt;God: All right.  &gt;Me: And on top of it all off, when I got home, I just want to soak my feet in my new foot massager &amp; relax. BUT it wouldn't work!!! Nothing went right today! Why did You do that?  &gt;God: Let me see, the death angel was at your bed this morning &amp; I had to send one of My Angels to battle him for your life. I let you sleep through that.  &gt;Me (humbled): OH  &gt;GOD: I didn't let your car start because there was a drunk driver on your route that would have hit you if you were on the road.  &gt;Me: (ashamed)  &gt;God: The first person who made your sandwich today was sick &amp; I didn't want you to catch what they have, I knew you couldn't afford to miss work.  &gt;Me (embarrassed): Okay.  &gt;God: Your phone went dead bcuz the person that was calling was going to give false witness about what you said on that call, I didn't even let you talk to them so you would be covered.  &gt;Me (softly): I see God. &gt;God: Oh and that foot massager, it had a short that would knock out all of the power in your house tonight.

t5_2sigz,oceanic_overlord,1331513046,"There are several different flat-out-crisis-in-the-moment strategies typically suggested. My favorite is doing anything that isn't SI and produces intense sensation: squeezing ice, taking a cold bath or hot or cold shower, biting into something strongly flavored (hot peppers, ginger root, unpeeled lemon/lime/grapefruit), rubbing Ben-Gay¬Æ or Icy-Hot¬Æ or Vap-O-Rub¬Æ under your nose, sex, etc. Matching reactions and feelings is extremely useful.  These strategies work because the intense emotions that provoke SI are transient; they come and go like waves, and if you can stay upright through one, you get some breathing room before the next (and you strengthen your muscles). The more waves you tolerate without falling over, the stronger you become.  But, the question arises, aren't these things equivalent to punishing yourself by cutting or burning or hitting or whatever? The key difference is that they don't produce lasting results. If you squeeze a handful of ice until it melts or stick a couple of fingers into some ice cream for a few minutes, it'll hurt like (to quote someone I respect) ""a cast-iron bitch"" but it won't leave scars. It won't leave anything you'll have to explain away later. You most likely won't feel guilty after -- a little foolish, maybe, and kinda proud that you weathered a crisis without SI, but not guilty.  This kind of distraction isn't intended to cure the roots of your self-injury; you can't run a marathon when you're too tired to cross the room. These techniques serve, rather, to help you get through an intense moment of badness without making things worse for yourself in the long run. They're training wheels, and they teach you that you can get through a crisis without hurting yourself. You will refine them, even devise more productive coping mechanisms, later, as the urge to self-injure lessens and loses the hold it has on your life. Use these interim methods to demonstrate to yourself that you can cope with distress without permanently injuring your body. Every time you do you score another point and you make SI that much less likely next time you're in crisis.  Your first task when you've decided to stop is to break the cycle, to force yourself to try new coping mechanisms. And you do have to force yourself to do this; it doesn't just come. You can't theorize about new coping techniques until one day they're all in place and your life is changed. You have to work, to struggle, to make yourself do different things. When you pick up that knife or that lighter or get ready to hit that wall, you have to make a conscious decision to do something else. At first, the something else will be a gut-level primitive, maybe even punishing thing, and that's okay -- the important thing is that you made the decision, you chose to do something else. Even if you don't make that decision the next time, nothing can take away that moment of mastery, of having decided that you were not going to do it that time. If you choose to hurt yourself in the next crisis time, you will know that it is a choice, which implies the existence of alternative choices. It takes the helplessness out of the equation.  So what do I do instead? Many people try substitute activities as described above and report that sometimes they work, sometimes not. One way to increase the chances of a distraction/substitution helping calm the urge to harm is to match what you do to how you are feeling at the moment.  First, take a few moments and look behind the urge. What are you feeling? Are you angry? Frustrated? Restless? Sad? Craving the feeling of SI? Depersonalized and unreal or numb? Unfocused?  Next, match the activity to the feeling. A few examples:  angry, frustrated, restless     Try something physical and violent, something not directed at a living thing:     Slash an empty plastic soda bottle or a piece of heavy cardboard or an old shirt or sock.     Make a soft cloth doll to represent the things you are angry at. Cut and tear it instead of yourself.     Flatten aluminum cans for recycling, seeing how fast you can go.     Hit a punching bag.     Use a pillow to hit a wall, pillow-fight style.     Rip up an old newspaper or phone book.     On a sketch or photo of yourself, mark in red ink what you want to do. Cut and tear the picture.     Make Play-Doh or Sculpey or other clay models and cut or smash them.     Throw ice into the bathtub or against a brick wall hard enough to shatter it.     Break sticks.     I've found that these things work even better if I rant at the thing I am cutting/tearing/hitting. I start out slowly, explaining why I am hurt and angry, but sometimes end up swearing and crying and yelling. It helps a lot to vent like that.     Crank up the music and dance.     Clean your room (or your whole house).     Go for a walk/jog/run.     Stomp around in heavy shoes.     Play handball or tennis.  sad, soft, melancholy, depressed, unhappy     Do something slow and soothing, like taking a hot bath with bath oil or bubbles, curling up under a comforter with hot cocoa and a good book, babying yourself somehow. Do whatever makes you feel taken care of and comforted. Light sweet-smelling incense. Listen to soothing music. Smooth nice body lotion into the parts or yourself you want to hurt. Call a friend and just talk about things that you like. Make a tray of special treats and tuck yourself into bed with it and watch TV or read. Visit a friend. craving sensation, feeling depersonalized, dissociating, feeling unreal     Do something that creates a sharp physical sensation:     Squeeze ice hard (this really hurts). (Note: putting ice on a spot you want to burn gives you a strong painful sensation and leaves a red mark afterward, kind of like burning would.)     Put a finger into a frozen food (like ice cream) for a minute.     Bite into a hot pepper or chew a piece of ginger root.     Rub liniment under your nose.     Slap a tabletop hard.     Snap your wrist with a rubber band.     Take a cold bath.     Stomp your feet on the ground.     Focus on how it feels to breathe. Notice the way your chest and stomach move with each breath.     [NOTE: Some people report that being online while dissociating increases their sense of unreality; be cautious about logging on in a dissociative state until you know how it affects you.] wanting focus     Do a task (a computer game like tetris or minesweeper, writing a computer program, needlework, etc) that is exacting and requires focus and concentration.     Eat a raisin mindfully. Pick it up, noticing how it feels in your hand. Look at it carefully; see the asymmetries and think about the changes the grape went through. Roll the raisin in your fingers and notice the texture; try to describe it. Bring the raisin up to your mouth, paying attention to how it feels to move your hand that way. Smell the raisin; what does it remind you of? How does a raisin smell? Notice that you're beginning to salivate, and see how that feels. Open your mouth and put the raisin in, taking time to think about how the raisin feels to your tongue. Chew slowly, noticing how the texture and even the taste of the raisin change as you chew it. Are there little seeds or stems? How is the inside different from the outside? Finally, swallow.     Choose an object in the room. Examine it carefully and then write as detailed a description of it as you can. Include everything: size, weight, texture, shape, color, possible uses, feel, etc.     Choose a random object, like a paper clip, and try to list 30 different uses for it.     Pick a subject and research it on the web.     Try some of the games and distractions at digibeet's page; she's assembled a lot of distractions. wanting to see blood     Draw on yourself with a red felt-tip pen.     Take a small bottle of liquid red food coloring and warm it slightly by dropping it into a cup of hot water for a few minutes. Uncap the bottle and press its tip against the place you want to cut. Draw the bottle in a cutting motion while squeezing it slightly to let the food color trickle out.     Draw on the areas you want to cut using ice that you've made by dropping six or seven drops of red food color into each of the ice-cube tray wells.     Paint yourself with red tempera paint. wanting to see scars or pick scabs     Get a henna tattoo kit. You put the henna on as a paste and leave it overnight; the next day you can pick it off as you would a scab and it leaves an orange-red mark behind.  Another thing that helps sometimes is the fifteen-minute game. Tell yourself that if you still want to harm yourself in 15 minutes, you can. When the time is up, see if you can go another 15. I've been able to get through a whole night that way before. I tried all of that. I still want to hurt myself. Sometimes you will make a good-faith effort to keep from harming yourself but nothing seems to work. You've slashed a bottle, your hand is numb from the ice, and the urge is still twisting you into knots. You feel that if you don't harm yourself, you'll explode. What now? ",¬Æ

t5_2r05i,MrSmite,1331519605,"Unfortunately, your comment demonstrates *everything that is wrong with the griefer mentality*. Also, it lends credence to the general perception that griefers are typically younger players who are sorely lacking in both social skills and maturity. While I'm sure that's a broad over-generalization, it wouldn't surprise me if it were largely true, and as an anecdote, your comment greatly supports that widely-held belief.  Destroying someone else's work when it's known that those actions will create a great deal of grief, distrust, anger, and ill will among the involved parties really suggests to me that griefers may not fully understand the importance of social interaction. Or rather, it demonstrates that they completely lack the capability of understanding that *negative behavior for the sole purpose of doing something someone else doesn't like* achieves nothing. All it does is piss people off. It doesn't accomplish anything else.  It's very similar to keying someone's car, slashing their tires, or otherwise destroying the property of someone you don't know simply ""for the thrill."" What does that accomplish?  Since I suspect you're probably in the age range of 10-16, I'll offer you some advice that--if you heed it--will be useful to you when you go to college. Or don't. I don't really care either way, because I'm just text on the screen. But here it is: Humans are social creatures. Got that? Good. Let's explain, shall we?  We, as a species, have gotten where we are largely because of teamwork, cooperation, and the ability to overcome adversity through community. The reason you're able to sit here on Reddit and discuss how ""fun"" griefing is to you is because of *teamwork, cooperation, and community.* Superficially, you may not understand why the rest of us see griefing as a hugely negative thing, but I suspect the answer is easier to find than you might realize. Since you're likely to have some trouble with this, I'll give you a cheat code to life that's from the *Handbook of Being Human‚Ñ¢* and tell you why: It's because most of us are wired with a sort of tribal mentality and this is *fundamentally a good thing*. Since part of our identity is defined by who we associate with and who we *identify* with as clansmen, whenever someone attempts to bring harm to that, we feel that part of our identity has been tarnished. On the other hand, the feeling of belonging to something much larger than ourselves isn't always a bad thing; it brings with it the survival and success we've enjoyed as a species. It lets us overcome impossible odds.  This is also part of the reason why laws against murder, unrest, and defacement of property have existed off and on throughout history. (Yes, I know, some of these laws have been abused or ushered in for religious reasons--let's ignore those for now.) You see, each of these *generally bad things* lead to a break down of our social fabric to some degree, and because cooperation and community both require trust, the breakdown of trust destroys any foundation for cooperation and community to thrive. In short: If our ancestors didn't have a certain level of trust for each other, we'd likely still be walking around on our knuckles. Except that there's a problem: Several of the *other* species of apes *also* exhibit things like--wait for it--trust, community, cooperation, and teamwork. Heck, even ants demonstrate cooperation on a very basic level. While they might not be able to understand anything beyond basic instinct and hard-wired reactions to pheromones, the humble ant is an excellent example of what something very small can accomplish as a cog in a much larger society where anarchy is largely unheard of.  So, while griefers might attempt to justify their activities by believing that there's no big deal--it's just a collection of pixels--the problem is that they're *not* ""just pixels."" In essence, they represent an abstraction of what it's like to be human, and what it's like to be part of a ""tribe,"" most especially on larger servers. If you have no idea what I'm rambling on about, I'd suggest taking a sociology class *as soon as you get into college* and most importantly *pay attention*. It'll do you a world of good.  Don't worry if you think I'm a tool or an idiot right now and think my advice is stupid. That's perfectly normal. If you've read this far, I've planted a seed. It's a seed that'll germinate into a thought, and that thought will eventually deliver to you a fruit. When you eat of this fruit, you'll wake up one day thinking ""*Holy crap, MrSmite was right all along.*"" Then you'll want to learn more, and you'll become an incredibly productive member of society.  **TL;DR** People are social animals. They don't like you breaking their things. Bad people break things, and bad people interfere with social progress and trust. Bad people must therefore have sanctions placed against them.

t5_2qh1i,Kodiak_Cartel,1331521676,"When I was in college, My 22nd birthday was spent drinking. All day I was drinking. I polished off, over a period of about 18 hours, a Heineken Draughtkeg and a bottle of Southern Comfort. While walking through my Fraternity house hallway, I tripped over a speaker cable (we had huge house speakers for parties) and spilled my beer all over this chick while also knocking her to the ground. I apologized profusely and offered her a nice beer from my fridge, seeing as she was now drinkless. Well, I got back to my room with her in tow and as I was reading the different types of beer she could choose from, I heard my door close and the lock click.   Before I can turn all the way around, she already has her hands down my pants. I went into panic mode and decided to just go with the flow. I had her on my couch, Shirt off, pants off, bra off, panties halfway off, when my brain said to me ""Excuse me, Kodiak_cartel? You want to stand up and assess your current situation?""  I did so and realized that this chick was a total bridge troll. Not only that, but as I stood with her panties in hand, I contemplatively gazed at her pussy and, upon closer inspection, realized that I was ridden with herpes sores. I managed to get a ""I'll brb. Gotta get a condom"" and just peaced out, went to a different party and went back home an hour later.   Well, I turns out she waited for me that whole time, and finally got tired of waiting as I was returning. Well, she was pissed, saw me and, still naked, fat and sweaty, chased after me. I finally took refuge in the above ground pool in our courtyard and hid under the water while breathing through some straws I grabbed from a couple empty drinks.   A week later, we found her underwear in a bush in our side yard, complete with wallet, id and phone. We had our house advisor send her an email to pick it all up, but she never showed.    **TL;DR** Almost wrote myself a drunken, lifetime prescription for Valtrex¬©",¬©

Quite likely they are doing it because they dislike the Taliban who ruined the country when they run it, or want the cash/US residence that the US can hand out. Or both.  Look at the person who informed on Uday Hussein  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uday_Hussein#Death  &gt; Later, the American command said that dental records had conclusively identified two of the dead men as Saddam Hussein's sons. They also announced that the informant (possibly the owner of the villa in Mosul in which the brothers were killed) would receive the combined $30 million award previously offered for their apprehension.[15] &gt; &gt; Furthermore, the owner of the villa, Nawaf az-Zeidan, who is distantly related to Saddam, was granted U.S. citizenship and permitted to depart from Iraq. Locals said Zeidan had tipped off United States forces that Saddam's sons were staying there. The brothers were said to have become overbearing in their demands and took his hospitality for granted. On 18 June 2004, Zeidan's brother Salaah al-Zeidan was killed, and three of his male relatives (including an eight-year-old boy) traveling in the same vehicle were wounded by unknown assassins.  So he got paid a lot of money and got US citizenship and also got Uday Hussein killed. Unfortunately Uday's buddies killed his brother in retaliation.  Uday Hussein was [not a very nice man](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uday_Hussein#Allegations_of_crimes) and certainly - to use an Assange phrase - had it coming to him.  http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,454453,00.html  &gt; After months of recovering from an attempt on his life that put eight bullets in his left side, Uday Hussein, the eldest son of Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, was ready to party. At his first outing in 1998, at the posh Jadriyah Equestrian Club, he used high-powered binoculars to survey the crowd of friends and family from a platform high above the guests. He saw something he liked, recalls his former aide Adib Shabaan, who helped arrange the party. Uday tightened the focus on a pretty 14-year-old girl in a bright yellow dress sitting with her father, a former provincial governor, her mother and her younger brother and sister.  &gt; &gt; Uday's bodyguards picked up the signal and walked through the darkened room, flicking cigarette lighters as they approached the girl's table. Uday, then 33, flipped on his too, confirming they had identified the right one. When the girl left the table for the powder room, Uday's bodyguards approached her with a choice, says Shabaan, who was Uday's business manager. She could ascend the platform now and congratulate Uday on his recovery, or she could call him on his private phone that night. Flustered, she apologized and said her parents would allow neither. One of the guards replied, ""This is the chance of your life"" and promised she would receive diamonds and a car. ""All you have to do is go up there for 10 minutes,"" he urged. When she demurred again, the bodyguards pursued Uday's backup plan. They maneuvered the girl in the direction of the parking lot, picked her up and carried her to the backseat of Uday's car, covering her mouth to muffle her screams.  &gt; &gt; After three days the girl was returned to her home, with a new dress, a new watch and a large sum of cash. Her parents had her tested for rape; the result was positive. According to Shabaan's account, Uday heard she had been tested and sent aides to the clinic, where they warned doctors not to report a rape. Furious, the father demanded to see Saddam himself. Rebuffed, he kept complaining publicly about what Uday had done. After three months, the President's son had had enough. He sent two guards to the man to insist that he drop the matter. Uday had another demand: that the ex-governor bring his daughter and her 12-year-old sister to his next party. ""Your daughters will be my girlfriends, or I'll wipe you off the face of the earth."" The man complied, surrendering both girls.

t5_2qh16,ZeroCool1,1331575565,"Corrosion of alloys by molten salts is fundamentally different than corrosion caused by high temperature air or water oxidation.10  Many alloys rely on the oxygen in air and in water to create a stable protective film on the surface of the metal (CrO, NiO, Al2O3).  These oxide layers are not stable in fluoride containing salts.  Fluoride salts also attack chromium through grain boundary dissolution through impurity corrosion reactions, intrinsic corrosion, and galvanic corrosion.10   II.A. Impurity Corrosion Reactions  There are three reversible reactions by which impurities in molten salt can chemically corrode an alloy.12  H2O+2F-‚ÜîO2-+2HF	 (1)  H2O+F-‚ÜîOH-+HF	 (2)  M0+xHF-‚Üî H2+MFx	 (3) Where M is any metal in the exposed alloy, and x is the oxidation state of the metal M.  In order to produce corrosion, these reactions must all work together. Impurity driven corrosion originates with water.  By introducing water into a molten salt, a disassociated fluoride can react with it producing an oxide or hydroxide and hydrofluoric acid gas, as shown in eqs. 1-2.  This hydrofluoric acid can then fluorinate metals which are exposed to the molten salt and convert them into metal difluorides.  The metal difluorides can then dissolve into the salt, exposing more bare metal.  In order to stop these reactions, all the water, oxides, and hydroxides must be removed from the salt.  II.B. Intrinsic Corrosion  Intrinsic corrosion occurs to the favorable free energy of formation of many transition metal fluorides. Fluorination reactions with more negative free energy of formation indicate that a transition metal is more unstable in fluoride salt.  By examining the Gibbs free energy of formation for metals being converted into metal fluorides  a series can be made which ranks each metal‚Äôs nobility.  It has been found that in molten fluoride salts the tendency for common alloying constituents to be attacked increased in the following order: W, Mo, Ni, Co, Fe, Nb, Cr, Mn, Ti, Zr, Al, with Al being the most dissolution prone and nickel being the most noble.10   In a FHR, the temperature could change over several hundred degrees celcius‚Äîreaching its peak around the fuel and its minimum in the heat exchanger.  Such a temperature difference causes dramatic metal difluoride solubility gradients within the molten salt.12  Therefore, in hot areas with higher solubility, more metal difluorides are produced and subsequently dissolved into the salt.  As this salt flows to colder areas of the reactor, the solubility of the contaminants decreases and metal difluorides will precipitate and build up.  In the small arteries of a heat exchanger, these deposits could completely block the flow of molten salt.  As the salt moves back to the fuel, the temperature would rise, causing it to absorb metal difluorides.  This cycle can repeat indefinitely; metal difluorides must be removed before they can reach a saturation solubility of the cold leg.  II.C. Galvanic Corrosion  When fluoride salts melt the individual components disassociate.  For example, LiF would turn into Li+ and F-.  These individual components are called a Lewis acid and base.  A Lewis acid is capable of accepting an electron while a Lewis base will give an electron.10  Through this mechanism a molten salt can become electrolytic, causing dissimilar metals with different electromotive potentials (EMP) to experience galvanic corrosion.  A metal with a negative EMP can become anodic while a metal with a positive EMP can become cathodic.  In order to prevent corrosion through galvanic couples, a FHR must be constructed from metals whose positions on the galvanic series are similar. ",‚Üî

We forced our way to the front to see my friend, lying on the pavement, literally split in two. There was blood, guts, and shit everywhere. I swear to God‚Ñ¢, I just about passed out.   We talked to the cops at the scene because we identified ourselves as the deceased's friends.

It was calculated he had spent around $1,500 total (this is money he had been saving up since jr. high ‚Äì very sad) on the food. He had eaten it all at once, causing massive internal trauma to his stomach and intestines. He had ""freaked out"" (as one cop put it) and quickly eviscerated himself with a knife he had grabbed from the BBQ stall. Needless to say, we were shocked.

Until Creative Suite, in fact, they used to produce standalone products that were actually *standalone*. They didn't depend on some vast underpinning of cruft.   Starting with CS4, though, they deliberately decided to make a 3rd OS interface that was Adobe-only‚Ñ¢ and which is apparently not well enough defined for their engineers to all be on the same page about what it is. For example, in Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign, you can still break free of the ""application frame"" paradigm, but in Flash there is no way to turn it off or escape it.  As for my own personal axe to grind against Adobe, I agree that Flash and AIR aren't great, but the **true evil** (as an IT manager) that Adobe hath wrought is their freaking Creative Suite installer system from hell. They've been promising to fix it for years, but it is still the most byzantine time-suck of *anything* I've encountered on the Mac platform.   * If you attempt to uninstall an older version of CS, you will trash your current install.  * If you attempt to reinstall an older version, you will trash your current install. * It's basically impossible to complete *any* install of CS in under about 45 minutes unless you do a lot of extra work to set up images on your server, installer scripts etc. For a full production suite, I think you're up into the hour or more range. * They put interactive dialogs in the *worst* possible places, requiring you to babysit for 5 or 10 minutes to click one button before you can move onto another machine. * They have no ""combo"" updater concept like Apple does, such that you can apply every goddamn patch Acrobat could need at once to get from fresh install to fully patched in one go. Instead, you have to apply, check for updates, apply, check for updates, etc etc etc. * They have as much as admitted on their blogs several iterations ago that it's a mess and yet very little has changed!  \* *Wipes spittle off the monitor‚Ä¶* *  Having said all that, I agree that you simply can't beat the combination of software that Adobe has created for print production, if nothing simply because they can do more than RGB in the color engine. And if you don't think they've been innovative with their software, launch Quark XPress 5 and Quark XPress‚Ä¶ 7(?), then launch InDesign 1.0 and InDesign CS5.5 and see how far the two companies have come in the last 10 years or so.

t5_2qil9,InRustITrust,1331653508,"&gt;The game was a little too buggy and hardcore for me (some jerk killed me in high-sec shortly before CONCORD blew him up), so I quit playing.  This is going to happen no matter what.  There is no safety in Eve.  If this is likely to make you quit again, don't bother.  People will shoot at your internet spaceships, so get used to that.  &gt;The main reason I quit was because the mac cient was still buggy, and I got a little bored.  Eve is a sandbox.  Check [The Flowchart‚Ñ¢](http://swiftandbitter.com/eve/wtd/) if you need ideas.  Try some out and see what works for you.  The game is not played like other games where the whole experience is wrapped into questing and you have a little magic compass to lead you around by the nose everywhere and NPCs to tell you what to do.  With agents you can have a little bit of that, but that gets boring quickly.  Many of us only mission until we've got enough money to buy a few nice ships to go do more interesting things.  Frankly put, most of the Eve economy revolves around destroying one another's internet spaceships.  The reason that your stuff even sells on the market at all is because half of it gets blown up whenever someone loses a ship.  If you don't want to blow some up yourself then figure out how to support the economy of people who do.",‚Ñ¢

DOTA 2 Minimum Requirements:  * Operating System: Windows¬Æ 7 / Vista / Vista64 / XP / Mac  * Processor: Pentium 4 3.0GHz or AMD Athlon equivalent  * Memory: 1 GB for XP / 2GB for Vista  * Graphics: DirectX 9 compatible video card with 128 MB, Shader model 2.0. ATI X800, NVidia 7800 or better  * Hard Drive: 3.0 GB of free space  * Sound: DirectX 9.0c compatible sound card  You need to buy a new video card as the 6150SE is an integrated graphics card is only good enough to run games at roughly playstation 1 level graphics.  I played with a 9600 GT and got roughly 25-30 fps with this video card. I would recommend an HD 6850 @ $140 if you want full 60 fps.  Make sure your motherboard/case has enough room for a large video card. I checked your [motherboard](http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?lc=en&amp;dlc=en&amp;cc=us&amp;docname=c00906137) and if this is true then it should be no problem.   Your CPU is not too old. My old machine was a Core2Duo E4500 @ 3.0 ghz which is roughly half as good as the CPU you have right now and I was able to run DOTA2 decently with a few hiccups. In fact, you probably did not know that your computer would actually run games like Skyrim and Deus Ex HR on high/ultra settings if you had a good graphics card. I know because I've done these myself on a much weaker processor.  Upgrade to a bigger PSU to accommodate a new video card. A 500Watt PSU would only cost roughly $40.  Good luck and have fun!",¬Æ

t5_2qqjc,CrackCC_Lurking,1331716534,"Most people (especially in America) that are in the spotlight, hold a important/public position, call themselves **agnostic** &amp; not atheist. The backlash from the religious fanatics is too heavy to claim you ""believe there is no god"". By using the term ""agnostic"", they can just say ""I don't know if there is a god or not"".  It's kind meaningless to be agnostic because each sides contradicts the other. Part of either ""belief"" is totally incompatible with the other.  *You can't be for &amp; against something* Being religious is to believe in god. Being an atheist is believing there is no god. If you are agnostic &amp; believe there could be a god, then you are ultimately acknowledging his his existence.  Sorry I went off track here.  Famous people (mostly in America) will never admit to being atheists &amp; will most likely say they are agnostic *(unless they are a ""provocative"" personality, like an atheist version of a religious fanatic).* They say this just to get the religious fanatics off their back, keep their jobs, friends, customers, fans, keep getting invited to tv shows, preserve their children/wife/house from attacks, etc etc... They can always repy to a hostile religious attack by ""going neutral"" &amp; claiming they just don't know.   This tactic is used by everyone in common situations e.g: You are walking home when you get accosted by a dozen drunken rednecks. One of them says to you: ""Fuck those niggers! They're not real people, they're like animals?"". Now you don't believe this is true, but if you say what truly believe &amp; how you think they are just as human as the rednecks, you know they turn hostile &amp; from that point on, only bad things will happen. So you take the ""agnostic"" approach &amp; say ""I don't know"". Thus diffusing the situation &amp; still (more or less) sticking to your principles. Their claim is as ludicrous as religion. It's as ""un-provable"" as religion, in a sense that they will just ignore &amp; claim it to be false, or you'll need to prove your ""proof"". It's a pussy way out (imo), but people that are exposed to the general public like that have to be neutral like that. It's just being ""safe"". That's what politicians, celebrities (mostly the new ones, the older ones &amp; the ones that have proven themselves can be more honest), athletes, &amp; C.E.Os all adopt the same ""neutral"" stance. Not just on religion but on just about everything that people could care strongly about.  If you took the time to read this I ‚ô• you! Sorry for making it so long &amp; repetitive.",‚ô•

The rollout has never resumed since.      3- There's never been an ICS rollout for the AT&amp;T and Sprint compatible versions of the Nexus S.      4- Google and Sprint continue to advertise that the Nexus S will be the first Android device to get updates.  I quote directly from the Sprint page: ""Who will love it: Android-powered players who want the latest Google Apps‚Ñ¢ and OS updates as soon as humanly possible.""      This is why many people bought the phone, and it's essentially false advertising at this point now that the GSII and Transformer Prime have ICS.  This has nothing to do with whether someone roots and flashes a custom ROM, so please stop suggesting that as a solution.      What makes matters worse is that the Android G+ page and help forums are inundated with requests asking Google for any news regarding the update, and Google remains completely silent.

Also, do NOT fill the drymistat tube with PG. They are designed to work directly with tap water.

If so and it was 75% in the salt test, then the 60% currently could be from the humidor getting acclimated/seasoned.

(NASDAQ: HAS) and Atari, S.A. announced today the settlement and resolution of the complaint against Atari, S.A. and the counterclaims filed by Atari, S.A. against Hasbro, Inc. filed in December 2009 in regards to the Dungeons &amp; Dragons brand. &gt;Digital licensing rights for Dungeons &amp; Dragons have been returned to Hasbro. Atari will continue to develop and market several games under license from Hasbro and Wizards, including the #1 Xbox LIVE¬Æ hit Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Daggerdale and the upcoming Heroes of Neverwinter for Facebook. Additional settlement details remain private. In addition, the acquisition of Cryptic Studios by Perfect World Entertainment Inc. from Atari in July 2011 has delayed the Neverwinter PC Game scheduled for release later this year. Perfect World will be investing in a more immersive experience for release in late 2012.   Basically, there was a suit, WotC (Hasbro) got the license back, but Atari is still developing games. It's probable that Atari either has a license for some time and it is non-exclusive, or that Atari has the ability to develop a limited number of games that were already on their roadmap, and then they have to go back to the bargaining table to get the rights for further development.",¬Æ

See here: http://www.engadget.com/2012/03/15/confirmed-ics-coming-to-the-nexus-s-in-the-next-few-weeks/        This was just discussed in another post yesterday.  Here's my comment from that thread that clarifies quite a bit:      So much misinformation in the comments.   1- Nexus updates are Google controlled, not carrier controlled. The latest Galaxy Nexus on Verizon may be the first exception, and mark the end of true Nexus.      2- The I9020-T (the GSM Nexus S model compatible with T-Mobile USA) started to receive ICS updates in December 2011 but the update was stopped toward the end of the month due to a battery life bug. The rollout has never resumed since.      3- There's never been an ICS rollout for the AT&amp;T (GSM) and Sprint (CDMA) compatible versions of the Nexus S.      4- Google and Sprint continue to advertise that the Nexus S will be the first Android device to get updates. I quote directly from the Sprint page: ""Who will love it: Android-powered players who want the latest Google Apps‚Ñ¢ and OS updates as soon as humanly possible.""      This is why many people bought the phone, and it's essentially false advertising at this point now that at least the GSII and Transformer Prime have ICS. This has nothing to do with whether someone roots and flashes a custom ROM, this has to do with a major selling point of Nexus: get your OFFICIAL updates first.      Many Nexus fans choose Nexus so they DON'T have to unlock their bootloader, root their phone, and flash custom ROMs until they find one they like.  They buy a Nexus so they DON'T have to do all that, and can just enjoy the latest and greatest OS direct from Google.  It's sorta like the iPhone version of an Android phone.    What makes matters worse is that the Android G+ page and help forums are inundated with requests asking Google for any news regarding the update, and Google remains completely silent. Many Nexus S users would just like a freakin' reply from Google, like ""Sorry for the delay guys, we are stumped by a major bug but don't worry we haven't forgotten about you.""      This isn't just a CDMA issue, and it isn't just a GSM battery bug issue.  It's also PR issue.    ",‚Ñ¢

It wouldn't stay on. I knew I had to try.   Just then, I heard a ""Hurry up. Spray that roach, I gotta go to bed soon"" from the other room. At this point I was trembling like a mother fucker. Arms shaking, could barely move forward. Basically in a matter of 20 minutes or so, I've gone from tired and weary traveler, to Gandalf at a solid [6] fighting the Balrog at the Birdge of Khazad-d√ªm. This shit was intense.   ***""YOU SHALL NOT PASS!!!""*** I screamed at the top of my lungs. Although my brother insists it sounded like ""aroacharoachOMGgetitaway.""  I sprayed that roach for five whole seconds before it scurried off. I followed it. While I was hesitant to keep spraying this toxic poison into my brother's room right next to where he sleeps, he signaled for the roach to be put out of it's misery. I sprayed at it for another 20 seconds, going all around the room. By the time my can sputtered, and finally cut off, my foe was dead.   After being coaxed, and berated for well over 2 minutes, I finally started to carefully shuffle my way over to the bathroom to get some TP. I unwound about a quarter of the roll, and stared at my fallen opponent. I was too petrified to move.   ""You gotta face your fear""   ""I can't""  ""Do it! You have eight seconds""  ""8...""  ""7...""  ""6...""  ""5...""  ""4...""  ""3...""  ""2...""  ""1...""  I still couldn't do it. After some time had passed, I started creeping my way over. Soon this rescue chopper that was the wad of TP was hovering directly over the wounded combatant. The chopper landed, and clamped down on the load.   ""You gotta talk me through this"" was said by me.   ""Pick it up, put it in the toilet, and flush.""  And you know what? I did, and it *did* work.   tl;dr Peace was restored to the Shire ",¬Æ

t5_2tf60,Elliptical_Tangent,1331818853,"&gt;Fuck the enivornment (sic), i'd rather see those 1.27 billion fed, educated and working.  The people you're microlending to are living, such as they are, directly off of the environment.  If they start mismanaging their soils, their water, their plants, or their livestock (if any), if they ""fuck the environment,"" they're going to be dead, not poor.  Lending them $25 doesn't get them a sales job at IKEA so they can buy California tomatoes to feed the family.  My point here is that finance is poison.  Not having access to finance is like not having access to dioxin: it's 100% positive for the human condition.  What truly dirt-poor people need are the resources to sustain their lives with a prospect of increasing their lot in life.  Giving them an amount of cash that has to be repaid with interest gives them a temporary increase but darkens the long-term prospects... unless they can exploit something at their disposal to make more money than they borrowed^1.  Giving a goat to people living hand-to-mouth puts resources at their disposal to increase their lot in life.  Even if you give someone a goat, and expect them to give you a goat back in the future, this is better than money for people with no access to money, because goats use reserves of solar energy to reproduce themselves endlessly.  If you force them to do things they would not normally do to get money they normally have no access to for repayment, Bad Things‚Ñ¢ will happen.  The fact that microlending ran into default problems speaks well of the people who took the loans.  &gt;The problem with attacking interest too much is that you end up discouraging loans, which hurts poor people more than rich people. Because rich people are less dependent on loans to create further wealth.  You're perfectly backwards with this, actually.  The rich live on credit.  Because they have so much in the bank, and inflation is constant, it's much cheaper for them to borrow $100,000 than to liquidate assets in the amount of $100,000 because interest on the loan is more than offset by interest they're making on investments plus inflation.  Loans are offered a point above the bank's borrowing rate (~5%, because repayment is guaranteed), inflation is reducing the debt annually by 2%+, and their investments are returning 10% in a _bad_ year.  They make ~3% (in a really bad year) by borrowing instead of liquidating.  Poor people have extremely limited, and expensive credit because repayment comes in the form of employment, which can end at any time for a multitude of reasons.  I think what you mean here is that credit hurts poor people disproportionately, and I agree.  Please note, I'm not talking about outlawing interest, I'm talking about boycotting it.  If the majority boycotted loans, we'd reduce interest rates, as institutions got more and more desperate for ventures to invest in.  RES tells me I've upvoted you 115 times since I installed it ~2 weeks ago.  I obviously value your contributions, but there's an issue here that's difficult to grasp because we become like fish talking about water.  Our society teaches us to be good consumers, build good credit, etc.  That doesn't mean it's good, it means we've been trained to think it is.  ¬†^1 Which begs the question: Why didn't these poor people exploit this cash-generating resource in the first place, rather than take a microloan? Answer: They know exploiting it to be destructive, and don't gasp the destructive power of interest.",‚Ñ¢

What is life like with social anxiety disorder? Imagine being 6‚Äô6, 300lbs, appear to be quite intimidating and most likely able to handle most one on one fights with ease‚Ä¶ but still being afraid of certain people, certain experiences, even being very nervous around women who are ¬Ω your size! This is just a taste of my experience in life and hope it helps illustrate mental illness for others:  I grew up being bullied on a daily basis at school because I was bigger than everyone else. I enjoyed running around and being a typical outdoors kid, loved soccer/football (FIFA not NRL/NFL/etc) yet I gained weight and kids loved to tease me about it.  Being quite an emotionally sensitive kid, I could hear the disgust, the dislike, the ‚Äúeww you‚Äôre gross‚Äù in just the tone of voice, so when that tone came along with the very negative words, it had quite a lot of impact on my young mind.  Being overweight made me slower on the field, and because of that, I copped quite a lot of verbal abuse from my teammates. It got to the point where soccer was no longer fun, and this was probably the start of my anxiety around other people. I didn‚Äôt want to change to another team, as I feared it would happen there too.  My fear of others was especially true of the popular ‚Äújock‚Äù or sporty type who seemed to be so cool, and for them to hate me was quite crushing to my self-esteem. At age 10 I was already quite shy, and I didn‚Äôt feel safe at all away from family. I got homesick quite a bit on sleepovers and even had to go home from a school camp.  One day at primary school, I did something wrong, and one of my teachers physically assaulted me, whilst screaming at the top of his lungs. This left the entire classroom of kids crying, and from that moment on I had a lot of fear hearing any adult male yell. Because of that experience, as well as two other teachers assaulting me, my trust with adults in authority was broken heavily.  In high school the bullying continued daily, I‚Äôd get teased for answering questions and being too smart, and teased over my weight. I was also starting to get the ‚Äúnipple cripple‚Äôs‚Äù, being tripped (which led to a broken wrist) and the intensity of the verbal abuse increased. In turn, my weight had climbed up as I was comfort eating more, avoiding sports because of fear of the other people in the teams and all of this was leading me to become more anxious.  In high school my graduating class had quite a lot of mean girls, more so than normal in other classes. I received quite a lot of teasing from them. Some even asked me out as a joke, or used me AS a joke: the girls would tease the other girls that I was their boyfriend, as the idea of that was so offensive to them.  By my senior year of high school I was probably obese, I had a suicidal depression, was self-mutilating to feel a pain that wasn‚Äôt emotional as an escape, and skipping school to avoid the bullying and abuse. I escaped into computer games, staying up quite late just to feel any sense of happiness. This sent me from straight A‚Äôs to C‚Äôs, D‚Äôs and total F‚Äôs, and eventually I completely shut down and gave up on schoolwork nearly altogether.  I listened to music to try tune out the world and all of the pain. I never had a girlfriend in school, and I was rejected whenever I asked out a girl. This was all summed up when I was one of the very few people at the prom without a date‚Ä¶even though there were more females than males and a few females actually went together.  ‚ô¶‚óä‚ô¶  After high school, I moved away for college and was living on my own away from friends and family, leaving me quite isolated. My health suffered so badly that I had to move back to the family home as I was unable to focus nor had the energy for college. My father died soon after moving back home, leaving me feeling extremely lonely. That was when my depression hit the big time. I pretty much locked myself away in my room at home for a few years, only seeing a few people occasionally and my remaining family at night.  One night I tried going out to the clubs. Some guy asked me for a drink, and when I refused he decided to punch me a few times in the stomach. He only stopped when I tensed my stomach. He left me alone and started throwing chairs and stormed out. I was totally paralyzed in fear, yet my body has enough strength that I could have put him in hospital.  All of these events basically caused my unconscious mind to treat humans as a threat. My fight-or-flight responses being triggered quite easily causes me to avoid a lot of social situations. I would feel hesitation and find any excuse to not go to the shops if I had to, and avoided going to parties and seeing people I didn‚Äôt know very well.  At this point, my work life is nearly non-existent, I had a few months‚Äô work but depression really took its toll on me and I had a large breakdown. The fear of talking to new people, let alone women, has made it very hard to make new friends and I haven‚Äôt asked anyone out in many years. The few female friends I‚Äôve had, I‚Äôve been the typical ‚Äúnice guy‚Äù to, too afraid to show my intentions, so they‚Äôve led to very little romantic interest.  ‚ô¶‚óä‚ô¶  Social anxiety is basically living with an intense fear of social situations, chronic fear of being judged, and feeling embarrassed or humiliated by your actions. It can cripple your life, can withdraw you from society itself and it‚Äôs been strangling me for too long. The loneliness I‚Äôve felt is extreme and has actually worsened my depression. I am someone that actually loves being around people I feel safe with.  Sadly, the automatic fear I have has truly limited my ability to socialize or even be employed: the fear that something bad will happen, the fear that someone will abuse me, fear I won‚Äôt measure up to expectations, even the fear of the fear itself!  I‚Äôve made a lot of progress though over the years, I‚Äôve finally killed the depression and the social anxiety is lowering a lot. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy plus Acceptance and Commitment Therapy has helped tremendously in removing the negative thoughts. Slowly getting out into the world, taking courses to learn new skills and meeting people with a trusted friend or family member is exposing and reprogramming my mind to see that not all humans are going to hurt me. It‚Äôs a slow progress but it‚Äôs making me stronger every day.""",‚ô¶

I'm going to assume he isn't a whole lot younger than you. If he were say 5-6 years younger then it'd be easy, younger brothers look up to their older brothers whether they like it or not, AND whether you know it or not so just let him know you watch it and like it and he'd change his mind quickly. Your younger brother is NOT going to think negative of you no matter what, it's brother code. If he does, he's a shitty brother.  Okay, back to assuming a maximum of 2-3 year age gap, IF the conversation ever comes up (don't force it) and he spouts off about how it's weird just say, ""I'm gonna go watch it for myself, I'll report back."" Wait a day. ""Hey, this show isn't as bad as you thought, give it a try, it's pretty funny.""  BAM, DONE. Don't push it any further!  At this point:  He knows you like the show. This does one very important thing, any negative thoughts about bronies will immediately come back to thoughts of you since the mental association is there. If he cares enough about you (and he fucking better) then his opinion about you and your associations will change.  Note: This basically applies to anything.  example: I like dubstep, my roommates (very good friends) don't and they sometimes crack a joke about it (messaging me with ""HEY! HOW DEM WUBS GOIN!??!?!"" if I have my music a little loud). The important thing is that they won't think too negatively about people that listen to dubstep because they know they have a friend that listens to it. They also aren't bronies (they haven't watched any of the show either) but they know I like it and typically don't give me a hard time about it.  TL;DR: PSYCHOLOGY BITCHES! IT WORKS!  Note: I assume you guys grew up together and he likes you. If he barely knows you then the psychology thing kinda goes out the window.",‚ô•

Something that needs to be taken up with your city.  I find most bicyclists dont actually know the laws.    It basically comes down to this basic principle:  Bicyclists have the same rules as motorists WITH CLEAR EXCEPTIONS.  They actually have more laws and standards than either motorists and pedestrians - for good reason.  There is also one MAJOR misconception = Bicyclists do NOT have the right of way.

The scene floor opens and up comes Hatsune Miku, with her long, green pigtails, big eyes and black stockings. The public cheers for her, but she can‚Äôt hear them.   That‚Äôs how it goes when the 16 years old popstar have her first concert outside her home country, Japan. The show was set up for Anime Expo, North-Americas biggest event for cartoon fans (The author probably meant anime‚Ä¶).  The public is watching the pop phenomenon Hatsune Miku, a 3D hologram, a lot like a digital avatar. She doesn‚Äôt have a soul or a personality, but an amazing voice and an appealing look. That way, it looks like she is standing on the stage together with the band.  It‚Äôs the Japanese technology company Crypton Future Media that have created Miku. The company uses voice recordings from actors and runs it through a software called Vocaloid produced by Yamaha. Out comes Hatsune Miku‚Äôs voice, a fusion of human and electronic sound.   Using animated pop starts isn‚Äôt entirely new. In 1998 was the band Gorillaz created by Damon Albarn. The four animated band members were drawn by the British, and their first album sold 7 million records.  In 2006 ended the designer Alexander McQueen one of his shows something he called ‚Äúa piece of technological magic‚Äù. A rotating white cloud transforms into a hologram of Kate Moss in a waving white dress.    The Japanese idol Hatsune Miku was created after Gorillaz. Miku was created in 2007, she was supposed to be an advertisement for Vocaloid.  ‚ÄúThe thought was that we could create a new instrument, as long as we had a cool or cute manga character to sell Vocaloid. So we focused on actors, not singers with the best voice, because we knew the program would handle the voice.‚Äù explains Hioryuki Ito, the president of Crypton Future Media in a youtube interview. Vocaloid, the program that can be used to create any song on your computer, became a success. ‚ÄúHow is the sales going? It is going really good. We estimated that 10% of the customers would be young girls, but it turned out to end up at 45%, it looks like they really like Miku‚Äù said Kazumitsu Shimizu from Sony Music in 2009. She have half a million fans on facebook by 2012. All the 10000 tickets were quickly sold at a concert in Tokyo, the concert was also streamed live to 24 cinemas all over Japan. On Norwegian teen blogs Hatsune Miku is commonly talked about by Justin Bieber and Hello Kitty fans (I can‚Äôt really say I agree with that statement).

t5_2qpp6,Barrin,1332027674,"Hey guys :D I am the author. TL;DR is as follows:  ""There is a certain.. spectrum of breadth of gameplay, and every RTS game has it's tendencies on this spectrum. By breadth I mean: how often should you be expanding? At what point do you no longer need to expand because you have all the resources you want or need to maintain a supply cap?  When it is more desirable to expand more rapidly and continue expanding longer, there is more opportunity for smaller engagements to occur over a larger area of the map more often. Expanding makes you more vulnerable, and vulnerability means action. However, if you were to do the opposite and concentrate more of the focus into a smaller area (by say, putting more resources in each base) you start leaning towards the ""Deathball"" [read: simple] side of the breadth spectrum.  Due to a relatively high maximum resource collection rate per mineral field and therefore base (among other things), SC2 is mathematically predisposed to the ""Deathball"" side of the spectrum as opposed to ""smaller, more frequent, more spread out"" engagements. Even though (like any good RTS game) SC2 is incredibly complex, this predisposition results in a relative lack of complexity, lack of map variety, lowered skill ceiling, improper risk vs. reward when microing individual units resulting in more emphasis on macro compared to micro - which in combination with other factors is self-perpetuating. Reversing this by reducing the maximum resource collection rate per base also positively enhances a host of other elements.""  Remember, we CAN do this without blizzard!

The probing delegation includes lawmakers Hamidzai Lali, Abdul Rahim Ayubi, Shakiba Hashimi, Syed Mohammad Akhund and Bismillah Afghanmal, all representing Kandahar province at the Wolesi Jirga and Abdul Latif Padram, a lawmaker from northern Badakhshan province, Mirbat Mangal, Khost province, Muhammad Sarwar Usmani, Farah province.  The team spent two days in the province, interviewing the bereaved families, tribal elders and survivors and collecting evidence at the site in Panjwai district.  Hamizai Lali told Pajhwok Afghan News their investigation showed there were 15 to 20 American soldiers who executed the brutal killings.  √¢‚Ç¨≈ìWe closely examined the site of the incident, talked to the families who lost their beloved ones, injured people and tribal elders,√¢‚Ç¨¬ù he said.  He added the attack lasted one hour involving two groups of American soldiers in the middle of the night on Sunday.  √¢‚Ç¨≈ìThe villages are one and a half kilometre from the American military base. We are convinced that one soldier cannot kill so many people in two villages within one hour at the same time, and the 16 civilians, most of them children and women, have been killed by the two groups.√¢‚Ç¨¬ù  Lali asked the Afghan government, the United Nations and the international community to ensure the perpetrators were punished in Afghanistan.  He expressed his anger that the US soldier, the prime suspect in the shooting, had been flown out of Afghanistan to Kuwait.  He said the people they met had warned if the responsible troops were not punished, they would launch a movement against Afghans who had agreed to foreign troops√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ presence in Afghanistan under the first Bonn conference in 2001.  The lawmaker said the Wolesi Jirga would not sit silent until the killers were prosecuted in Afghanistan. ""If the international community does not play its role in punishing the perpetrators, the Wolesi Jirga would declare foreign troops as occupying forces, like the Russians,"" Lali warned.  President Hamid Karzai on Thursday asked the US to pull out all its troops from Afghan villages in response to the killings.",‚Ñ¢

t5_2cneq,mvlazysusan,1332043370,"Audio of the event: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrRMiePxZBU  I shall first start off this report by saying that Bryan Spencer, the Saint Charles County Repulican Party Central Committe man who was tasked to organize the caucus told my fellow Ron Paul Coordinator here in Saint Charles at the last Saint Charles County Central Committe meeting, that 'if the Ron Paul people come in and hijack the caucus, I will do everything in my power to throw out the entire delegation on a technicallity.'  This is exactly what happened, but first, let me clarify what Spencer means by 'hijack'. There are no rules going into the caucus, aside from Robert's Rules of Order. At the caucus, the temporary chairman opens the meeting with the Pledge of Allegiance and a prayer. Next, the temporary chairman opens the floor for nominations for a permanent chair in which the entire body of voters votes for. The newly elected chairman opens the floor to nominate a secretary. Then the chairman appoints a parlamentarian, the rules committe, and the credentials committee. The rules are voted on and then the body selects delegates to go to the Congressional District Convention and the State Convention.  So, the key is to organize your suppporters into 'slates', which are lists of names of the supporters who wish to be delegates. Ideally, you want to have your slates full, this way, all delegates that go to the conventions will be your candidate's delgates. It is the process of a democratic republic. Organization is the key going into the caucus, and we had came prepared with the only complete slate of delegates. The Romney camp and Santorum camp had incomplete slates. We could have potentially have walked away with all of the 147 of the delegates.  So this is what Spencer means by 'hijack'. There is no rule against having your stuff together and taking all of the delegates. It is the name of the game. We knew the GOP rules going in, and intended to follow them. We know that Spencer was encouraging the Santorum Coordinator to take all of the delegates if she had the numbers, so, it seems that he is okay with his guy getting the delegates, but not ours.  So, when we checked into the caucus, we were asked to vote in a straw poll for the candidate of our choice. Bryan Spencer's claimed intent on this was to proportion the delegates by the votes from the straw poll, but I believe different. I believe that the GOP had a plan in case the Ron Paul supporters showed up with good numbers, and throwing out the delegation was it.  When it comes to a caucus, the body chooses the rules, not the GOP central committee. Before the temporary chairman (Eugene Dokes) opened the meeting, a set of rules was not proposed, but was made binding. One of the rules included was the ban on recording devices. I believe this 'rule' was put in for the reason of raising a ruckus. When that rule was read, it was very clear that everyone, not just Paul supporters, in that room opposed the rule. Boos ensued as well as Bryce Steinhoff, myself, Brent Stafford, and countless others tried making motions to overturn that rule and to put it up for a vote. Eugene ignored the motions, shouts of 'point of order', etc.  After around 20 minutes of deadlock and an eventual submission of the camera owner to turn it off, he opened the meeting by appointing a parlimentarian, appointing the credentials committee, and the rules committee, which are all appointments made by the PERMANENT chair whose has been elected by the body, not the temporary chair. He completly went around Robert's Rules of Order. This is why the GOP did not want the process recorded. Again, they completly ignored parlimentary rule to usher in their chairman.  Next, Dokes opened the floor for nominations for the permanent chair, in complete opposite order than Robert's Rule of Order states. At this time, the whole gynasium errupted in the call for Brent Stafford to be nominated, which Dokes ignored. Dokes then made his own nomination for chair and then called for a voice vote. The entire gymnasium erupted again with the call for 'division', which is the term that calls for a standing or ballot vote, which was utimately ignored by Dokes. Dokes's voice vote result was that the ""I's'' have it, which was clearly not the case. Dokes then motioned to close nominations, called for a voice vote, and nominations were closed without any recognition of motions from the floor. Then the new 'permanent chair' made a motion to adjourn the meeting, swung his gavel, and it was over.  No delegates were awarded.  Next, we tried to amass the people outside in the parking lot to have our own stump caucus to pick the delegates for the conventions. But the Saint Peters Police came over and arrested Brent Stafford for ''tresspassing"", as well as Kenny Suitter, the man with the camera.  I go back to what Bryan Spencer said to Bryce at the Central Committee meeting: 'If the Ron Paul people try to 'hijack' the caucus, I will do everthing in my power to throw out the entire delegation.  'Did Ron Paul have a majority in the room according to the straw poll at the door? Did the vote counters see this and feared the Ron Paul campaign would be able to elect their chair and walk away with all of the delegates? Did the sight of the Ron Paul Coordinators and the Romney Coordinators brokering a deal worry them that Santorum would not get any delegates?  I know for sure a few people on the Saint Charles GOP Cnetral Committee are Santorum supporters.  The news media is focusing on the guy with the camera who was arrested, but I can assure you that there was more behind this caucus than is being reported.  This is plain corruption.

I feel like that plays into the Christian right's agenda to downplay a civil rights issue, and make it about ***sex*** **sex** ***sex*** **sex** as much as humanly possible. These Santorum supporters probably think all gay men actually act like this - that if homosexuality is widely accepted, they'll just be rolling around the streets naked on top of one another, and our soldiers will be having openly gay sex overseas while the Taliban take over the world, etc. This just reinforces that preexisting belief, while strengthening their homophobia by evoking absolute revulsion at the sight of two gay men expressing mutual affection.  **On the other hand**, they without a doubt **should** be exposed to a society in which gay men are openly gay. In an ideal world, the sight of two gay men making out should not shock onlookers any more than that of a heterosexual couple behaving similarly. Not only that, but *gay men should be far more prevalent in the media, as something beyond a walking punchline repository*.

John Malcolm Thorpe Fleming ""Jack"" Churchill  ""Mad Jack"" Churchill Nickname	Mad Jack Born	16 September 1906 Hong Kong Died	8 March 1996 (aged 89) Surrey Allegiance	 United Kingdom Service/branch	 British Army Years of service	1926‚Äì1936 1939‚Äì1959 Rank	Lieutenant Colonel Awards	Distinguished Service Order, Military Cross   Churchill stares down the barrel of a captured Belgian 75 mm field gun. Lieutenant Colonel John Malcolm Thorpe Fleming ""Jack"" Churchill, DSO &amp; Bar, MC &amp; Bar (16 September 1906 ‚Äì 8 March 1996), nicknamed ""Fighting Jack Churchill"" and ""Mad Jack"", was a British soldier who fought throughout World War II armed with a longbow, arrows and a Scottish broadsword. He once said ""any officer who goes into action without his sword is improperly armed."" Contents  [hide]  1 Early life 2 Second World War 3 Later life 4 Family 5 Notes 6 References [edit]Early life  Born in Hong Kong to English parents and educated at King William's College on the Isle of Man, Churchill graduated from Sandhurst in 1926 and served in Burma with the Manchester Regiment. He left the army in 1936 and worked as a newspaper editor. He used his archery and bagpipe talents to play a small role in the film The Thief of Bagdad. [edit]Second World War  Churchill resumed his commission after Poland was invaded. In May 1940, Churchill and his unit, the Manchester Regiment, ambushed a German patrol near L'Epinette, France. Churchill gave the signal to attack by cutting down the enemy Feldwebel (sergeant) with his barbed arrows, becoming the only known British soldier to have felled an enemy with a longbow in the course of the war.[1] After fighting at Dunkirk, he volunteered for the Commandos, unsure of what Commando duty entailed, but was interested because it sounded dangerous. Churchill was second in command of No. 3 Commando in Operation Archery, a raid on the German garrison at V√•gs√∏y, Norway on December 27, 1941.[2] As the ramps fell on the first landing craft, Churchill leapt forward from his position and played a tune on his bagpipes, before throwing a grenade and running into battle in the bay. For his actions at Dunkirk and V√•gs√∏y, Churchill received the Military Cross and Bar. Perhaps Churchill's most impressive military exploits came in early 1942. It is claimed that he and five other Commandos took down a whole German outpost of around 300 men. The mission took them three weeks, in which time they hid in the dense undergrowth surrounding the outpost, surviving on a diet of Marmite and salami. In July 1943, as commanding officer, he led 2 Commando from their landing site at Catania in Sicily with his trademark Scottish broadsword slung around his waist and a longbow and arrows around his neck and his bagpipes under his arm.[3] This was again repeated at the landings at Salerno. Leading 2 Commando, Churchill was ordered to capture a German observation post outside of the town of La Molina controlling a pass leading down to the Salerno beach-head. He led the attack by 2 and 41 Commandos, infiltrating the town and capturing the post, taking 42 prisoners including a mortar squad. Churchill led the men and prisoners back down the pass with the wounded being carried on carts, pushed by German prisoners. He commented that to him it was ""an image from the Napoleonic Wars.""[4] He received the Distinguished Service Order for leading this action at Salerno.[5] In 1944, he led the Commandos in Yugoslavia, where they supported the efforts of Josip Broz Tito's Partisans from the Adriatic island of Vis.[6] In May, he was ordered to raid the German held island of Braƒç. He organised a motley army of 1,500 Partisans, 43 Commando and one troop from 40 Commando for the raid. The landing was unopposed, but on seeing the eyries from which they later encountered German fire, the Partisans decided to defer the attack until the following day. Churchill's bagpipes signalled the remaining Commandos to battle. After being strafed by an RAF Spitfire, Churchill decided to withdraw for the night and to re-launch the attack the following morning.[7] The following morning, one flanking attack was launched by 43 Commando with Churchill leading the elements from 40 Commando. The Partisans remained at the landing area. Only Churchill and six others managed to reach the objective. A mortar shell killed or wounded everyone but Churchill, who was playing ""Will Ye No Come Back Again?"" on his pipes as the Germans advanced. He was knocked unconscious by grenades and captured.[7] He was later flown to Berlin for interrogation and then transferred to Sachsenhausen concentration camp.[citation needed]   Jack Churchill (far right) leads a training exercise, sword in hand, from a Eureka boat in Inveraray. In September 1944, he and a Royal Air Force officer crawled under the wire through an abandoned drain and attempted to walk to the Baltic coast. They were recaptured near the coastal city of Rostock, a few kilometres from the sea. In late April 1945 Churchill and about 140 other prominent concentration camp inmates were transferred to Tyrol, guarded by SS troops. A delegation of prisoners told senior Germany army officers they feared they would be executed. An army unit commanded by Captain Wichard von Alvensleben moved in to protect the prisoners. Outnumbered, the SS guards moved out, leaving the prisoners behind.[8] The prisoners were then set free. After the departure of the Germans Churchill walked 150 kilometres (93 mi) to Verona, Italy where he met an American armoured force.[citation needed] As the Pacific War was still ongoing Churchill was sent to Burma,[9] where the largest land battles against Japan were still raging, but by the time he reached India, Hiroshima and Nagasaki had been bombed, and the war abruptly ended. Churchill was said to be unhappy with the sudden end of the war, saying: ""If it wasn't for those damn Yanks, we could have kept the war going another 10 years.""[9] [edit]Later life  In 1946 Twentieth Century Fox was making Ivanhoe with Churchill‚Äôs old rowing companion Robert Taylor. The studio hired Churchill to appear as an archer, shooting from the walls of Warwick Castle. After World War II ended, Churchill qualified as a parachutist, transferred to the Seaforth Highlanders, and later ended up in Palestine as second-in-command of 1st Battalion, the Highland Light Infantry. In the spring of 1948, just before the end of the British mandate in the region, Churchill became involved in another conflict. Along with twelve of his soldiers, he attempted to assist the Hadassah medical convoy that came under attack by hundreds of Arabs.[10] Following the massacre, he coordinated the evacuation of 700 Jewish doctors, students and patients from the Hadassah hospital on the Hebrew University campus on Mount Scopus in Jerusalem. In later years, Churchill served as an instructor at the land-air warfare school in Australia, where he became a passionate devotee of the surfboard. Back in England, he was the first man to ride the River Severn‚Äôs five-foot tidal bore and designed his own board. In retirement, however, his eccentricity continued. He startled train conductors and passengers by throwing his attach√© case out of the train window each day on the ride home. He later explained that he was tossing his case into his own back garden so he wouldn‚Äôt have to carry it from the station.[10] He finally retired from the army in 1959, with two awards of the Distinguished Service Order, and died at home in Surrey in 1996. [edit]Family  Churchill married Rosamund Margaret Denny on March 8, 1941 [11] with whom he fathered two children. Malcolm John Leslie Churchill, born November 11, 1942 and Rodney Alistair Gladstone Churchill, born July 4, 1947. He was of no known relation to Winston Churchill. [edit]Notes  ^ Young, Peter (1969).

I've seen a number of people raise this issue in regard to the Post Office.  I have a couple of objections to it:  1) Only the Post Office can deliver mail to Post Office‚Ñ¢ mailboxes for exactly the same reason I can only use Southwest Airplane tickets to ride Southwest Airlines, stores only accept refunds for merchandise purchased at them, and your iPhone warranty can be voided by your taking it apart to fiddle with the circuitry.  The Post Office has certain obligations and protections regarding PO Boxes, it cannot guarantee those protections while providing carte-blanche access.  2) The Post Office does have a government sanctioned monopoly, this is because they also have a universal service obligation, and back when our country was still being forged, it was decided that the monopoly was a cheaper solution.  No other courier is held to the same standard.  If the Post Office were discontinued, what would be the mechanism for guaranteeing courier service to &lt;insert isolated town here&gt;?  (Note: the active word is guaranteeing)  It is similar to the way education is run - public schools have a universal service obligation to provide an education for everyone, private schools have the ability to reject students for whatever reasons they deem necessary (performance/aptitude is the most common), the major difference is that education does not require a network spanning the world.  Would you prefer that the government mandate that UPS and FedEx are obligated to deliver documents to anywhere in the world (possibly within a set time frame)?

Here's some highlights:  --- The POWERHOUSE Solar Shingle system is much more affordable than you might realize. Federal tax credits of 30%, along with state and utility incentives, can combine to offset expenses by as much as 50-60% ‚Äì attractive paybacks that can reduce your cost significantly.  What are the factors the will affect cost? The specific cost for an array of DOW POWERHOUSE‚Ñ¢ Solar Shingles will vary from home to home and will depend on a number of factors including location and orientation of the home, energy output objectives and more. If you would like to know more about how solar subsidies work, and their availability by state, check out the Database of State Incentives for Renewable Energy (DSIRE) website: http://www.dsireusa.org  When sunlight hits the shingles, photovoltaic material converts it into Direct Current (DC) energy. This is then converted to Alternating Current (AC) by an inverter located in a garage or basement. Now you have electricity that is available to power the appliances in your home. The electricity you generate is credited with your utility company, and applied to your electric bill.   The POWERHOUSE ‚Ñ¢ Solar Shingle is backed by the Dow brand and has various warranties. One of the most important things about POWERHOUSE‚Ñ¢ is all the science that has gone into assuring it is not just a great solar product, but a great roofing product.

t5_2qh5b,Zombiescout,1332188961,"&gt;I don't think it is a question because empirically it makes no difference and as I pointed out leads to an infinite regress. If atoms quack like a duck, they are a duck. If you have no better way to classify it other than to point out all classifications are slippery, my reply is ""well duh.""  You have yet to illustrate this infinite regress. Nor does it make sense to even talk of in this discussion, the point is that simple material constitution is not identity. That the constituting material can be further divided is not important. Not sure where I said classifications are slippery, some are but identity has pretty clear criteria.    &gt;Atoms would be such an idea that was ""left behind"""" then ""brought back"" because empirical reality had a model and mechanism that supporting their existence.  The name yes, otherwise no. The atoms of the atomists are not the same as those today, not even close to being the same idea.  &gt;&gt;I define the standards where what I'm talking about involves a specific definition. You are stepping into the domain of the spiritual and labelling it, which in many spiritual disciplines is the first mistake you can make. If you want to talk about spirituality, you will have to get used to some different ways of looking at life--at least the way I'm talking about it.  I am using the way theologians and philosophers of religion discuss these matters.   &gt;Philosophy is about ideas. The philosophy of science is also about ideas. I can entertain an idea without accepting it. ‚ÄúIt is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it."" --Aristotle  Entertain is not the same as use to support a position. You are making an argument that relies on a position that you don't accept.   &gt;Assume that I as a person am entirely quantified at the age of 15. Now assume I am quantified at the age of 40. It is clear that these two quantites are not going to numerically match and to use mathematics in such an instance would be foolish. Are you then going to insist that I am not, actually, me?  Yeah that is not what numerical identity is at all. See [this](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/identity/) and [this](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/identity-time/) first. Then you should see that mathematics is not at all relevant here and that you at 15 is still you at 40. The interesting thing is what the criteria for identity over time are since you may no longer have any of the same material composition at 40 that you did at 15.   &gt;Or the other possibility is that it is not an either/or scenario and you are asserting a fallacy as I mentioned from the beginning.  Numerical identity is stronger than qualitative... How could it be either or, if something is numerically identical it has all the same properties ‚àÄF(Fx ‚Üî Fy) ‚Üí x=y.   &gt;If we want to map humans isomorphically to matter, then at the scale all matter is one, all humans are also one.  All matter is one in that it is a single set of many individuals. Now the universe or if you prefer multiverse can be said to be one without the subdivision. Or there could be some substrata that is even more fundamental.   &gt;If you do that, I'm going to require you to give an argument as to why--and why all isomorphisms should not be similarly rejected.  I don't think isomorphisms are at all useful or even really applicable here. What we are concerned with is not merely structure, which is already captured in identity but everything else as well. Also isomorphism implies two distinct thing one onto the other. However each particular human is their matter, but in a certain arrangement and time-slice. So while still being just their matter, if you take them and liquefy them, they will cease to exist while that clump of matter will not.    &gt; In application, we map things to other things all the time, and they work fine.  That's great, we are talking about ontology though. If I use a plastic plant for the same aesthetic aim that I would normally use a real plant they are still not anywhere near the same thing though for my purposes from that one perspective they fill the same role.",‚Üî

""That the constituting material can be further divided is not important.""  Sure it is. If what you are saying basically does nothing to accord with how things appear to work in practice, and in fact leads to something like an infinite regress, then it isn't a very useful criticism, and certainly no grounds to reject something like identity. That we don't know what it is precisely doesn't mean it isn't those things--and that things can be divided indefinitely doesn't mean that it isn't those things or at the very least isomorphically those things. Furthermore, you neglect structure in the discussion, which is a critical element that I've pointed out where identity is concerned.  ""The atoms of the atomists are not the same as those today, not even close to being the same idea.""  That everything is made of atoms as a fundamental constituent of matter sounds ""pretty close"" to me.   ""I am using the way theologians and philosophers of religion discuss these matters. ""  So much the worse for you since you are discussing it with me.   ""Entertain is not the same as use to support a position. You are making an argument that relies on a position that you don't accept.""  Who said anything about supporting a position? I'm considering a perspective. You'll remember that is what I said from the very beginning of this thread.  ""Yeah that is not what numerical identity is at all. See this and this first. Then you should see that mathematics is not at all relevant here and that you at 15 is still you at 40.""  I agree with you, nor do I think it is relevant in the way you are using it where monism of the universe is concerned.   ""Numerical identity is stronger than qualitative... How could it be either or, if something is numerically identical it has all the same properties ‚àÄF(Fx ‚Üî Fy) ‚Üí x=y. ""  It is stronger than qualitative when qualitative isn't what should be used. You are trying to use mathematical reasoning where it has no business being used.   ""I don't think isomorphisms are at all useful or even really applicable here.""  Then I assume you are comfortable rejecting large branches of mathematics.  ""What we are concerned with is not merely structure, which is already captured in identity but everything else as well.""  At a universal level, structure is everything else. This is like saying that what we are concerned with with language is not the structure of it, but individual letters. It's a pointless objection.   ""However each particular human is their matter""  No. They are a particular structure of matter.   ""So while still being just their matter, if you take them and liquefy them, they will cease to exist while that clump of matter will not.""  But that structure of matter will not. Hence, the isomorphism fits.  ""If I use a plastic plant for the same aesthetic aim that I would normally use a real plant they are still not anywhere near the same thing though for my purposes from that one perspective they fill the same role.""  A plastic plant would, by definition, not have the same properties as an actual plant, so it wouldn't be used to make an isomorphism. Contrast this with the structure of matter to a human being, and I think the difference is clear. ",‚Üî

t5_2qh03,Malarki,1332198567,"If they ever make a WW2 AC i hope they make it from a Neutral German perspective where you have to fight all three Nations at once.  Stauffenberg and his group of assassins would be perfect for this scenario. The Reich holding the apple of eden while Russians and Americans trying to overwhelm Germany to get it into their hands first. Even tho' the ""Stauffenberg Attentat"" failed it was a distraction to steal the apple of Eden. Thats how the game would end and in an expansion you would try to smuggle it out after the Russian occuption and get it past the Berlin Wall.  All that would be possible without any propaganda bullshit and would be a really great way to get the story going. Afterwards including Pearl harbor and Hiroshima into it.   Anyway, i have no problem with the direction AC3 is going atm. Actually its a fresh setting and i can't wait to play it. It's not even out yet, maybe AC3 will make the American History darker then some people think right now and it will be the opposite of ""american propaganda"" but instead a intelligent, dark and tricky fantasy story, just like it was until now.   Some people seem to forget that AC isn't and never was trying to be historicaly authentic. It wasn't until now and i don't doubt that ac3 will change that.  so far, much love ‚ô•",‚ô•

t5_2qhwp,AlJoelson,1332204858,"One thing a lot of people ignore about Mass Effect 3: it's a jointly-authored narrative. Bioware create the storytelling framework for players to weave their own narrative for their own Shepard. Audience and reader input is not a factor with film or novels - it is impossible for people to alter the narrative of the primary source. Sure, they can step back and create their own fan-based works but that's never recognised as canon. Mass Effect works in tandem with players to create a story as dictated by both Bioware and the player themself. There's a shared authorship going on that means that players have a greater investment in the story and narrative that other mediums wouldn't permit. Step one for dismissing disgruntled fans is to call them entitled without understanding from where this entitlement stems, apparently.  Drawing straight-up comparisons to literature or cinema, or even to other linear games (been seeing the gayem jurnelsists writing articles stating such absurd things as YOU WOULDN'T PETITION THATGAMECOMPANY TO CHANGE THE ENDING OF JOURNEY, AMIRITE) is disingenuous as well - they're not apt comparison. In a game like Journey, you are a passive observer on a linear path. You are not presented with any choices that influence the state of the game world. Now, that's not saying it's a bad game in any way (loved it), but it's an entirely different game from something like Mass Effect.  We've also got pundits suggesting that Bioware amending the ending (either from fan pressure or via their own discretion) is a completely untenable notion because there is no precendent for such a change. ""You wouldn't blah blah author change ending of blah blah novel"". Games are not books, they are not movies. They are not unmalleable, static constructs. They are, in fact, constantly in flux. Developers amend and alter their games all the time. Rebalances via patches, new story content presented through DLC, etc. According to the **GAMES ARE ART** crowd, fans pressuring Bioware to change the ending is some kind of affront that precludes games from being art, but fans pressuring to change the other systems that comprise a game does not. A game is the sum of its part - it isn't just its narrative and story (again with the books). Moreover, the idea of digitially releasing an altered or extended ending after the game ships [is not a completely new one.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_of_Persia_%282008_video_game%29#Epilogue) We need to stop resting on the laurels of other mediums when treating games as art and think about how our medium can stand on its own.  Final point: I actually don't care if the ending gets the change fans want. I'm not averse to a Bad End. As Dante observed in *Clerks*, ""That's what life is: a series of down endings"", and without glorifying such a pessimistic sentiment too much, I'm inclined to lean on the side of the gloriously depressing. I'm not in the same camp as those who're petitioning to swap out Bioware's ending with some saccharine fluff that sees Shepard (alive and well) reunite with their love interest, running into each others arms in slow motion presented behind the vaseline smear of a daytime soap lens. Mass Effect has routinely been touted as a series wherein Your Choices Matter‚Ñ¢. My issue with the ending lies with the disappointing fact that the trilogy's Choices logline is completely discarded in the game's final ten minutes. There's no resolution. All the choices you made and were invested in leading up to this moment are ignored. The game doesn't acknowledge or follow-up such huge choices that were in the spotlight throughout the entire series, such as the Genophage and Quarian/Geth conflict. And that's where Bioware start stepping on my toes - those choices were my contribution to the story. I may be an entitled piece of shit, but I don't particular like being told that my contribution doesn't amount to diddley-squat.",‚Ñ¢

I was 'munk CP in 2009, then went seasonal until last October when they changed the requirements and I was ""laid off"". I get paid too well at my ""real"" job to quit for Disney just yet.  Anyways, here are my best stories, and a [short imgur album of my 2 favorite pictures](http://imgur.com/a/jleUn). The first picture was me and my grandmother. That was her first trip to Disney. Second picture was me and my favorite bro, The King. That Baloo was also the coolest dude I've ever had the pleasure of working with. He was trained in Red Ranger at Studios so he did things with that bear I did not know were possible. PS I am super jelly of your Special Events status.   **Favorite Happy Story:**  Was June from [Lil Einsteins](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Einsteins) at Studios. It was a really slow day. We had a kid who looked to be late teens, a non-verbal quadriplegic in one of those tricked out wheel chairs get on line with his parents. After he saw me once, he got back in line again, and  no one came in behind him so he and his parents hung out for a few minutes. I held his hand and played with his toys  - he had ALL the Einsteins AND a plush spaceship, you know this kid was a fan. I'm listening to his parents chat with the attendant. This kid is not just an Einsteins fan, he was a MEGA fan. They came to the park JUST to see the Einsteins. They were gonna go to the restaurant where Leo and June were for lunch, they were going to see the puppet show too!   But there was trouble. Annie was not available that day, so only 3 of the 4 Einsteins were available for pictures. Oh no, this would not do, thought I. My set was over so I rushed back to find a manager. I told him about this boy and his parents, and told him they would be having lunch at Play 'N Dine. Could they track him down? Could we have a Magical Moment‚Ñ¢ with this boy and ALL the Einsteins?   I went through my sets with bated breath. Eventually we got a replacement Annie. I'm down to my second to last set of the day. They found him! He's going to come for a Magical Moment!   They led the boy to a quiet spot out of the way, and all four of us converge between swap outs. We hug him, pat his hand, hold his toy versions of us. And just as we all crowd in for a picture...  *When You Wish Upon A Star* begins to play over the loudspeakers. THIS was not on purpose. I nearly break down in tears. As we waved goodbye, I turned and blew him a kiss. This paralyzed boy, who could barely move and could not talk... he puckered his lips and blew a kiss back at me. It was the last day of my college program.   **Best Horror Story:**  One time I was Winnie the Pooh at Crystal Palace and a party of *300 Brazilian Tourists* showed up at the same time. True story.

Two other prototypes were produced by Ford and Willys-Overland. The Army felt that the American Bantam Car Company was too small to supply the number of vehicles needed and it then allowed Ford and Willys-Overland to make attempts on their designs after seeing Bantam's vehicle in working order. Willys-Overland offered the lowest bid and won the initial contract. Willys-Overland now had what would become the standardized jeep design.

As early as 1959, treatment with DMAE was demonstrated to result in significantly improved test scores.5 A 1974 report on DMAE focused on two 10-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials involving 124 children with ADHD-related diagnoses. In one of these trials, positive results using DMAE were comparable to those using Ritalin¬Æ. Similar positive results were also seen in a 1975 study, wherein a placebo-controlled trial in 74 children found that DMAE at 500mg daily was as effective as methylphenidate.""

t5_2qxih,Mc808,1332262383,"Since the launch of Star Wars‚Ñ¢: The Old Republic‚Ñ¢, the Crew Skill system has been incredibly popular. Every week in-game, 52 million items are produced or harvested, 4.5 million item mods are installed and more than 35 million items change hands. Players actively participating in the Crew Skill system are generally better geared and have more credits in the bank than pure consumers.  That said, we still believe the Crew Skills can be made better. Without further adieu, here are some of the things you can expect for your profession when Game Update 1.2: Legacy goes live.  **Crafting Professions**   **Armormech**  Characters with the Armormech profession will now be able to learn Aim, Cunning, Shield and Absorb augments schematics, which may be reverse engineered for a chance to research their prototype and artifact variants.  Armormech crafters may now reverse engineer almost any modifiable outfit into an empty custom (orange) shell of the same name and appearance, which may now gain an augment slot when crafted with critical success.  **Armstech**  Characters with the Armstech profession will now be able to learn Endurance, Surge, Critical, Accuracy and Power augment schematics, which may be reverse engineered for a chance to research their prototype and artifact variants.  We have also added new schematics to create custom (orange) ranged weapons to the profession and enabled the reverse engineering and researching of vibroknife and shotgun variations. As with Armormech, a critical success while creating a custom weapon may yield an additional augment slot.  **Artifice**  As alluded to in a previous blog post, color crystals are seeing some change in Game Update 1.2. We want players to be able to choose their weapon color without having to worry about stats. To this end, we are introducing top-end crystals for all available colors to the game.  Lack of schematics is one of the major concerns we've heard from the community. To address this, we are adding a large number of schematics to the game. This includes elder game crystals as powerful as those found currently found through the highest level of Operations, as well as +Power crystals of various colors.  We have also added mid-level and end game schematics for the creation of the prestigious magenta crystal to the game along with a new exploration activity chain for obtaining them. All magenta crystal schematics have been changed so they can be freely traded via the Galactic Trade Network.  Artifice is also the first profession to gain some dedicated PvP crafting. Players may earn crystal schematics of various colors via PvP, making it the only profession able to create items that offer a permanent expertise bonus at this time. The required materials for these crystals will also be obtained through PvP, creating a closed loop for those players that prefer to only engage in Player versus Player conflict.  Finally, Artificers are now able to create willpower based shields for Sith Assassin and Jedi Shadow tanks and, while crafting Enhancements, gain a bonus item on a successful critical.  **Biochem**  With BioChem being in a fairly good spot already, we are not making any major changes to the profession at this time. Some minor changes include producing an additional implant on a crafting critical, reclassifying 'Red Goo' as a Grade 6 Biochemical compound via Bioanalysis Missions and a new, special recipe for the creation of delicious Ice-Scrabbler Jerky...  **Cybertech**  If your character has the Cybertech profession, you will now be able to sell any of the vehicles you create on the Galactic Trade Network, as we have removed their binding restrictions from the game.  A critical success while crafting grenades now results in double the number of grenades (which also had their cooldown reduced to 3 minutes to allow more frequent use), and a critical success when creating item modifications now yields an additional mod for your efforts.  **Synthweaving**  Players with the Synthweaving profession can now learn schematics allowing the creation of Strength, Willpower, Defense, Alacrity and Presence augments, which may be reverse engineered and researched into their prototype and artifact level variants. As with Armormech, a critical success crafting custom (orange) outfits will add an additional augment slot to the resulting item.  We have also added a number of additional light armor schematics and tweaked the material requirements for some custom (orange) outfits for better balance.   **Gathering professions**  After reading about augment crafting above, you are probably wondering where these changes leave the Slicing gathering profession, which previously was the only (and very random) source of augments for the game.  With Game Update 1.2, we are changing Augment Slicing missions to become the source of Sliced Tech Parts - the main material component used in the creation of Augments by Synthweaving, Armstech and Armormech crafters. We anticipate these components to be in extremely high demand once the update goes live, and enterprising Slicers should see considerable windfall from selling their wares on the Galactic Trade Network.  Slicing missions completed with a critical success may now occasionally yield premium quality augment schematics.  A large number of additional tweaks have been made to all other gathering professions, including new mission rewards, addition of high end material nodes in end game daily areas and the removal of mission failure from one-time mission discoveries. For a full list of our changes in this area, please look forward to the detailed patch notes that will accompany Game Update 1.2 when it arrives on the Public Test Server. Reverse engineering and Research  Reverse engineering has shown to be a surprisingly popular mechanic practiced by a large number of our players. With this update, the team has not only significantly increased the chances of successfully researching a new schematic through reverse engineering, but also improved the overall functionality of the reverse engineering system.  For example, you will now see a 'Research Available' indicator in item tooltips while in reverse engineering mode, indicating if a schematic can be researched from an item. The dreaded 'You already know this schematic' message when discovering an already known schematic is also a thing of the past. Instead, players now discover another available schematic in that case, leading to less frustrating and more predictable research advancement.  We have also added new content for both the leveling and end game:  * Players with the appropriate professions are now able to reverse engineer random loot items and acquire materials from them - including Operations materials from end game items. * Reverse engineering and research is now available for tier 2 end game items (and will automatically happen if the player wins a 'disassemble' loot in a group). * Mods from tier 2 end game items may now be extracted and researched. However, Armorings that provide a set bonus can only be extracted. They do not yield research schematics. * Modifiable weapons and armor can now be reverse engineered and researched into empty, custom (orange) shells with the same name and appearance, adding a wide variety of new outfits to the game.  **Droids‚Ä¶**  Finally, on the topic of everyone's favorite character, the C2-N2 Droid and its Imperial counterpart, the equally charming 2V-R8 Ship Maintenance Droid, I am pleased to publish the following statement from the Republic News Wire:  ""The C2 Droid Corporation is proud to announce the development of a new series of Droid sensors for their most popular product, the C2-N2. These sensors may significantly improve the crew skill efficiency and critical success chances of this unit when operated under normal, non combat conditions.   Not the be outdone by their Republic competition, the 2V Droid Corporation has announced a series of sensor updates for their popular 2V-R8 line of Droids. The corporation categorically denies reports that these new sensors may cause increase vocal frequency in the upgraded units!  Both lines of Droids reportedly had their personality matrix updated with an experimental emotion response chip, allowing them to accept gifts and tokens as a show of appreciation from their currently selected master. Crew skill performance of these units will increase upon acceptance of these objects in a way carefully created to simulate the response often associated with the transfer of goods between organics.   In related news, Balmorra Microprocessor Corporation has announced the discovery of a critical engineering flaw in the 'appreciation' subroutine of their bestselling 'Droid Vocal Response Chip' used on almost all ship maintenance droids currently available. The flaw is said to cause excessive expression of appreciation towards owners entering the proximity sensors of their Droids and is likely to blame for the sharp increase in escape pod related incidents around the galaxy over the last two months. A repair and replacement plan for the affected units has been devised and is said to take effect in the immediate future.""   **The road ahead**  The above should give a good idea of what to expect from Game Update 1.2 in regards to Crew Skills and the economy. This is definitely not a complete list of changes and it is by no means the end to our improvement efforts. Game Update 1.2. is just one more step on our continuing journey.  May the Force be with you!  Georg Zoeller Principal Lead Combat Designer",‚Ñ¢

The one I have (Boomerang¬Æ III Phrase Sampler ) allows you to record a part (I've never reached a time limit, so I'm guessing a couple minutes max on each channel), loop it over, stack multiple parts on a single recorded loop, and then switch between multiple loops you have recorded.  Actually, let me just copy/paste the features...  :-p  *Features *  ‚Ä¢  Flexibility provided by 4 distinct Play Styles.      Serial Play Style - loops play one after the other for building a song in verse/chorus/bridge fashion.      Serial Master Play Style - For serial style loopers it's nice to have a rhythmic background behind the melodic loops. Mute          the strings and record a short ""chika-chika"" or beat on the sides of your acoustic axe. This rhythmic master loop can          then play along with any other loop.      Sync Play Style - all loops can play simultaneously and are synced so they stay together.      Free Play Style - all loops can play simultaneously and are NOT synced; this is great for creating ambient soundscapes.  ‚Ä¢  3 or 4 loops - your choice. ‚Ä¢  Stacking - ""stacking"" is adding a part to a loop (There is no limit to the number of parts you can stack.) ‚Ä¢  Undo/Redo - the last part stacked can be muted, then played again or rerecorded. ‚Ä¢  Erase - loops can be erased one at a time or all at once; some loops can be erased while others plays. ‚Ä¢  Copy Loop - a complete loop can be copied whether it is playing or not. ‚Ä¢  Copy Live - this enables ""re-sampling"" and is very powerful; the pedal's output is routed to a new loop. ‚Ä¢  Octave - loop plays at half speed and an octave lower. ‚Ä¢  Reverse - loop plays backwards. ‚Ä¢  Once - loop plays one time through then stops or if already playing, it stops at its end. ‚Ä¢  Stutter - enables repeatedly starting a loop over before it plays all the way through, sort of like record scratching. ‚Ä¢  Fade - loop(s) fades in or out with one button press; fade time can be 3 to 43 seconds. ‚Ä¢  Reverse Solo - this is a built-in effect and enables you to create reverse leads live. ‚Ä¢  Two Sample Rates - 48KHz or 24KHz, both use 20 bit samples; through signal is always 48KHz / 24 bits. ‚Ä¢  Thru Mute Function - turns off through signal. ‚Ä¢  Expression Pedal Jack - connect an expression pedal for foot control of overall playback volume or Decay Rate. ‚Ä¢  Volume Knobs      Serial &amp; Serial-Sync Play Styles         Volume controls playback level      Sync &amp; Free Play Styles         Volume controls playback level of loop 1         Vol 2 controls playback level of loop 2         Vol 3 controls playback level of loop 3         Vol 4 controls playback level of loop 4 ‚Ä¢  Decay Rate Knob - sets the rate at which earlier parts fade when new ones are added; continuously variable from 0-100%. ‚Ä¢  Stereo or Mono - recording and playback will be stereo or mono depending on which of the Smart Jacks you use. ‚Ä¢  Smart Jacks - the RangTM III senses which jacks are being used and provides different signal routing options.",¬Æ

I'm new to doing this so I would like to know if there are there any sources that go in-depth about basic window management.  Awesome! From what I understand about Wayland, it's not so much a display server as it is a driver for displaying EGL contexts.  I would start poking around mesa and EGL, that's what actually does the window creation.  http://www.mesa3d.org/egl.html  http://www.khronos.org/egl/  &gt; EGL‚Ñ¢ is an interface between Khronos rendering APIs such as OpenGL ES or OpenVG and the underlying native platform window system. It handles graphics context management, surface/buffer binding, and rendering synchronization and enables high-performance, accelerated, mixed-mode 2D and 3D rendering using other Khronos APIs.  http://cgit.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/tree/src/egl/wayland/wayland-egl/wayland-egl.c  It looks like it provides the following methods to EGL.      WL_EGL_EXPORT void     wl_egl_window_resize(struct wl_egl_window *egl_window, 		     int width, int height, 		     int dx, int dy);      WL_EGL_EXPORT struct wl_egl_window *     wl_egl_window_create(struct wl_surface *surface, 		     int width, int height);      WL_EGL_EXPORT void     wl_egl_window_get_attached_size(struct wl_egl_window *egl_window, 				int *width, int *height)      WL_EGL_EXPORT void     wl_egl_pixmap_destroy(struct wl_egl_pixmap *egl_pixmap)      WL_EGL_EXPORT struct wl_buffer *     wl_egl_pixmap_create_buffer(struct wl_egl_pixmap *egl_pixmap)  So it looks like those are the basic methods you get to work with.",‚Ñ¢

Nobody says that the show's style is the only way to do it, but I think that before you try to develop your own style‚Ñ¢, you should get a feel for the original. Similar to how you usually learn to draw from life first, then abstract from that to get more cartoony or in whatever direction you want to take it.  Trying to replicate other art (the references from the show, in our case) as authenticly as possible (and not by tracing) is the first step in the process of creating original art and I don't think you should rush through that or skip it.  [](/bonbon ""I see that you pretty much completed that step and are already looking for your own style. Cool!"")

It's a peeve that I doubt most people would notice, but it disrupts the rhythm.  Your content has some good, basic framework. However, I'd recommend you segment it a bit more. Writing for the web needs to be more organized because the attention span is so limited. Make what they're looking for easy to find, *then* have the meat of info.

t5_2qs0q,Legolas-the-elf,1332483581,"First, what I don't like about your particular ad:  It's ASP.NET.  I've never talked to a single person who really understands the web who likes ASP.NET.  I'm not convinced they exist.  I can't think of many good websites built with ASP.NET.  Anybody taking that job would have to answer to somebody who doesn't understand the web but feels competent enough to make platform choices for web development.  That's an extremely unpleasant position to be in and that's *before* you consider the fact that you'd have to work with it all day.  You're asking for a university degree.  Some of the best developers I've worked with have no degree.  All of the worst have a degree.  I've seen absolutely no evidence that a degree is a useful filter, and I've seen plenty of evidence that employers that take degrees for web developers seriously are less likely to be pleasant to work for.  ""Flexibility regarding hours worked"" is usually a euphemism for your developers frequently having to work overtime.  ""Willingness to travel"" is far too vague to mean anything.  Are we talking days on-site with clients in the area or are we talking about 3 month contracts abroad?  ""Ability to stay focused, organised and calm in a fast paced environment"" rings alarm bells.  Every time I've ever seen anything similar to that in a job description, it's been a euphemism for mismanagement causing unnecessary stress and unpaid overtime for developers, where everybody lurches from one crisis to the next.  If you think developers will have a problem staying focused, organised and calm in your environment, then your environment is horrible.  I visited your website.  It told me *""Using the RIPKIT‚Ñ¢ process, Business Instincts Group (BIG) works with entrepreneurs and high-growth companies to provide strategic planning that ensures business execution.""*  I still have no idea what your company does.  Organisations who let people run rampant with meaningless business babble tend to have a lot of political bullshit to deal with.   What I would value in a job posting:  What do you score on the Joel Test?  What percentage of your projects are delivered on time and are successful?  A link to your coding standards.  A link to your employee handbook.  A rough idea of the team I'd be working with.  A rough idea of what the location is like.  Can I walk to several different restaurants for lunch?  Or are you in the middle of nowhere with the only option a dingy cafeteria?  Are you accessible via public transport?  Flexible hours.  Web development isn't normally a job that needs everybody to be working at the same time.  The ability to work from home on a regular basis.  People have built entire operating systems together with very little in the way of physical meetings.  Can't your web developers effectively communicate over the Internet for parts of their job?  Why not?  Other developers manage it easily.  The ability to work part time.  A good developer can make enough money to live comfortably working part time if they choose to, and organisations that depend on particular developers working on indivisible features that take longer than a week to implement tend to do nothing but stress people out.  A rough idea of salary.  ""Good"", ""market rates"", ""generous"" and similar terms mean nothing.  ""Between X and Y"" is needed.  A no overtime policy.  If a project needs extra hours spent on it to meet a deadline, then those hours should be given back as holiday once the immediate crisis is over.  The ability to improve my skill set.  What opportunities do you give your developers to learn?  Things that are direct necessities of specific projects don't count.  Learning for the sake of a particular project isn't an investment your organisation makes in its people, it's taking advantage of developers without compensating them or spending money on training, and it rarely works out well for the developer.  Any decent developer will have your day-to-day requirements down already.  So where's the edge skills you can build up with them, like devops?  What resources do you have in place for this?  Better technology.  Any decent developer can get plenty of work elsewhere without having to put up with ASP.NET.  You're weeding out all the good people with this alone.  You seem like you're a subsidiary of a large organisation.  Are you beholden to them or do you have a skunkworks type situation going on?  You'll note that a lot of the above can be summarised quite simply: don't enforce meaningless requirements just because it's conventional.  A degree is a meaningless requirement that is often included because it is conventional.  So is Mon-Fri, 9-5, 40 hours per week, on-site only.  Start with the job role.  What do you need the person to achieve?  Describe that, and the non-obvious dependencies. ",‚Ñ¢

If it were a public forum, well, sorry you got sexually abused but the joke was hilarious.

t5_2sokd,bluepepper,1332495080,"The trick is that it uses the planet's motion.  If there was a static planet, you'd be right: any acceleration gained by going towards the planet is canceled by the deceleration when you go away from the planet.  If you fall towards a planet at an initial speed of V, you will be back at a speed of V at the same point.  Like this:       ‚Üí -----------_      V             \                  ‚ò∫  |                    /      ‚Üê -----------¬Ø      V  And that's also true for a moving planet, as long as V is measured relatively to the planet.  But what happens if we measure the speed relatively to the sun?  So let's say the spacecraft is moving at a speed of V (relatively to the sun) towards the planet, and the planet is itself moving at a speed of U (relatively to the sun) towards the spacecraft.  It means the spacecraft is approaching the planet at a speed of V+U.  So it will also leave the planet at a speed of V+U relative to the planet, but in the opposite direction, which makes it a speed of V+2U relative to the sun.       ‚Üí -----------_      V             \                ‚Üê ‚ò∫  |                U   /      ‚Üê -----------¬Ø      V+2U  This (exaggerated and simplified) slingshot just accelerated your spacecraft by two times the speed of the planet.

The first prototype delivered to the Army was from the American Bantam Car Company which had just brought Karl Probst on board for the project. Two other prototypes were produced by Ford and Willys-Overland. The Army felt that the American Bantam Car Company was too small to supply the number of vehicles needed and it then allowed Ford and Willys-Overland to make attempts on their designs after seeing Bantam's vehicle in working order. Willys-Overland offered the lowest bid and won the initial contract. Willys-Overland now had what would become the standardized jeep design.

""he""]* shall be fined according as the woman's husband may exact from him, the payment to be based on reckoning. *[Others ""as the judges determine.""]* But if other damage ensues, the penalty shall be life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, burn for burn, wound for wound, bruise for bruise.  Annotation:   &gt; *Other damage* to the woman.   *Based on reckoning:* perhaps reckoning the age of the fetus, but both this translation and the alternative ""as the judges determine"" are questionable.   [Halakhic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halakha) [exegesis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exegesis) infers that, since the punishment is monetary rather than execution, the unborn fetus is not considered a living person and feticide is not murder (cf. [Exodus 21.]12-14 [n.](http:/// ""annotation"")); hence abortion is permitted when necessary to save the mother (Rashi and Yad Ramah to *[b.](http:/// ""Babylonian Talmud"") [Sanh.](http:/// ""Sanhedrin tractate"")* 72b; see also Gen. 9.5-6 n.).  **tl;dr**: According to the most original and authoritative sources on what the OLD Testament says, abortion isn't allowed for birth control, *but is NOT murder and IS allowed in extreme situations.*   Of course, Christians believe that the message of the NEW Testament supercedes the old one too, so actual Christians may consider what the New v.

However, this is bad.  Your system is repairing just about the most critical component in the system.  Without a BIOS chip, you just have a large paperweight (sorry for my lack of bedside manner).  A re-flash of the system, following information from [this page](http://www.gigabyte.com/webpage/20/HowToReflashBIOS.html), and using the files from [this page](http://www.gigabyte.com/products/product-page.aspx?pid=3908&amp;dl=1#bios), might help.  Updating the BIOS (I believe it will update both chips) might remove any bug that is causing this problem.  On the other hand, a re-flash of the system might also turn it into a paperweight, as there is a possibility of a bad BIOS chip.  Tough call, so you should [contact Gigabyte tech support](http://www.gigabyte.com) for further help.  They also have a [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/GIGABYTE) page.  Good luck, let us know how it goes!",‚Ñ¢

t5_2qh0r,fairwellIMJA,1332693421,"Hi. The first thing I'd like to say is there are two types of ""votes"", the first is the non-binding straw poll and that is a beauty contest that usually has no value. Then there is the selection of delegates from districts and counties that go on to the State and then the National conventions.    The difference between a ""Democracy"" and a ""Republic"" is this proses of selecting the delegates that make up something called ""The electoral collage"" that elects our president.   Take Missouri for an example. In the non-binding straw poll the results were:  Rick Santorum‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ138,957‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ55.2%  Mitt Romney‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ63,826‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ25.3%  Ron Paul ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ30,641‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ12.2%   Other‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ18,444‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ‚ÄÄ7.3%  But when it came to the caucuses the delegates (to the state convention) in counties went:  Jackson County - Paul = 105, Romney = 39, Frothy = O, Newt = O   St. Louis - Paul = 36, Romney = O, Frothy = O, Newt = O   It went that way for more or less the whole state. So when the MSM tells you Santorum won, they are not being honest with you. They are trying to break down your moral.   The most important thing you could do is see this vid: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OynCgwmD-HM&amp;feature=player_embedded about how our ""government"" does **not** count the votes, nor does the republican party, rather an outfit out of Spain that is owned by the military industrial complex is given all of the uncounted votes, and they tell the MSM what they say the vote totals are.    Thank you and have a Ron Paul day. ‚ò∫ ",‚ò∫

You need to find the things that make you you and that are important for you. If you are willing to love and care for someone you started dating imagine how much love and care you could emanate for someone that you can be friends with, count on and most importantly someone who will reciprocate all the feelings. DO NOT let someone have complete control over your happiness because you are a worthy individual that does not deserve that. Don't let it happen. I went through a very tough time in my life too. My mother was literally killing herself everyday with crack while  I had an evil stepmother and an apathetic father. ALL of this while I was trying to get good grades at school and succeed in life, Classsifying your happiness only makes you less happy. Find love and joy in everything you do. I like helping people so when I volunteered at a hospital and got to touch people and help them ion the most minute way that made me happy, I got a job at Mcdonald's and it was a bitch but I was helping people while being independent and getting money. i took pride in that and that made me happy. I played piano so when  I used my high school's $40,000 grand piano I felt joy. I'm overweight, so when I run 4 miles nonstop I feel joy. Go out and live, find the things that make you happy and make life so much more beautiful. Finding a person to share your love with is wonderful but when you don't have it you cannot let that bring you down. Love yourself and take pride in what you do before loving someone else..

""‚ó¶ Clubs will no longer be compelled to attend SA events in order to maintain their budget...  ‚ó¶ Community service requirements will be reduced from two community service events a semester, to two community service events a year.""  Fully support the first one, as frankly, SA events are mostly crap...not much of a point, just more hoops for clubs.  But why lower the community service?  4 times per year isn't that much...say at 2-3 hours each, that's not much at all.  Gets the clubs out into the community...as far as I'm concerned, community service doesn't have to be raking leaves or helping at a homeless shelter.  ""‚ó¶ The Student Association will also give budget increases based on success in competitions. In short, under the REASON Party's Administration, SA will reward success and effort.""  This is great.  If less money went to the clubs that just held banquet after banquet, and more to the clubs who actually go out and do something productive, we'd all benefit.  ""‚ó¶ SA will implement a guaranteed van policy, in which if a club can provide two-months notice on request for a van, a van will be guaranteed to the Club. ‚ñ™ Additionally, the REASON party will maintain two vans on short order, meaning that two vans will be reserved for clubs requesting vans with less than two weeks notice. This will allow clubs with an immediate need for transportation to acquire vans consistently.""  This is great as well.  The vans sucked this year.  No responses from the coordinator, or getting rejected 2-3 days before the trip after asking numerous times.  Does not make it easy on the clubs.  2 months is a lot, as often events aren't known about that far in advance, but I'd imagine there's probably a procedural/legal/expense issue in shortening that.  ""‚ó¶ A separate Nationals line will be reserved to the Sports Council, allowing for funds to be immediately granted to those clubs who need money to attend National Championships. Under the REASON Party, no club will be unable to attend Nationals due to lack of funds.""  How about non-sports clubs that make it to a national competition?  ""‚ó¶ The REASON Party will reexamine the Alcohol Policy, and advocate for more open bars at SA events such as Academic and Engineering Ball as well as at other large-scale club events and banquets. Financial assistance will be provided in certain cases to help clubs pay security costs associated with having alcohol at club events.""  Good luck...this would be great as well...can be a hassle now.  ""‚ó¶ The SA Book Exchange will be better promoted on Campus, the Department of Student Affairs will work to promote the efficacy of the program and ensure its expansion within the student body.""  This is one of the best things SA has to offer, and it's a shame that it has been neglected over the past few years.  Actually, the website just plain sucks in general.

Men who think being nice equals being passive are not Real Fucking Men‚Ñ¢ and nobody wants to have sex with them and they will die alone, mourned by nobody.  4. Jerks who 'pea-cock' are not being confident to attract women, they are harassing them, hoping that, eventually, the woman will accept that having sex with a jerk is an easier solution than making a jerk leave. Men who think they have to 'pea-cock' to get romantic attention are not Real Fucking Men‚Ñ¢, they are abusive assholes and likely rapists.  5. If you think pick-up artists or men's rights activists have anything intelligent to say, you are not a Real Fucking Man‚Ñ¢, and every woman who has to deal with you knows what a scumbag you are. Those that don't yet know hopefully carry pepper spray.  It's gonna be hard, but you don't have to stay like this. Don't hate women because of your own issues, and the rest will fall into place. When it does, you will be welcomed to the ranks of Real Fucking Men‚Ñ¢ with the biggest fucking hug of your life, and the world will be a slightly better, manlier place.

On good systems, there is no upper bound because the hashing algorithm is stream based and can handle whatever amount of data you throw at it and still outputs a uniform hash. So the amount of passwords you disallow by not allowing anything under 8 characters is negligible.  Take, for example a password system that requires 8+ characters, 1+ special, 1+ number and 1+ capital, it allows all ascii characters (including control chars, which are escaped before being shoved into the hashing algorithm). The number of available passwords is:       (255^128) - (255^7) = 1.089e308  And if you take away all of the requirements, but still allow the full ascii character set with an unspecified upper bound of 128:      255^128 = 1.089e308  The number of possibilities is so large that sectoring off a relatively tiny chunk of them as being too weak is still good security practice because you eliminate easy to guess passwords (e.g. jesus, password, stupid, 123456, etc) without shrinking your available password pool by any reasonable amount.  And yes, if you were wondering, I have used a 128 character password before. It also contained characters like the UTF-8 snowman (‚òÉ).  Edit: Take a look at the [graph of y = 255 ^ x](http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=y+%3D+x+%5E+128#sclient=psy-ab&amp;hl=en&amp;q=y+%3D+255+%5E+x&amp;oq=y+%3D+255+%5E+x&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=1&amp;gs_l=serp.3...53828l59641l1l59943l7l7l0l0l0l0l163l791l1j6l7l0.pfwe.1.&amp;pbx=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.,cf.osb&amp;fp=b6606e447fc8ca53&amp;biw=1118&amp;bih=589).

t5_2s7tt,radicand,1332813754,"background: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/26/deadmau5--madonna-molly-ultra-_n_1379437.html  When Madonna took to the stage Saturday night to introduce Avicii at Miami's Ultra Music Festival, she asked, ""How many people in this crowd have seen molly?""  Molly is a slang term for MDMA, the active chemical in ecstasy, a drug often associated with electronic dance music (EDM) concerts. The crowd erupted in cheers after Madge asked the question (see video of Madonna on stage at the bottom of this article), but not everyone in the EDM community was happy.  Deadmau5, one of the leading producers of progressive house music, took to Twitter and Facebook to rail against the pop star for what he called grossly irresponsible behavior.  ""Very classy there madonna. ""HUR DUR HAS ANYONE SEEN MOLLY???"" such a great message for the young music lovers at ultra,"" he posted on Facebook early Monday morning. ""quite the f'n philanthropist. but hey, at least yer HIP AND TRENDY! fucking cant smack my head hard enough right now.""  Madonna, whose album MDNA was released today, has yet to respond to the Canadian producer.  To Deadmau5 (whose real name is Joel Zimmerman), Madonna was trading on a negative association to appear relevant. By casually referencing MDMA usage at an event attended by 150,000 concertgoers and streamed online to tens of thousands more, the pop star helped cement an association that Zimmerman and other performers have fought to disprove.  Some fans, however, didn't take Zimmerman's side. When one Twitter user suggested that Deadmau5's music is enjoyed by ecstasy users, the artist quickly said he doesn't condone that behavior:   DJ DAZE@djdaze 26 Mar 12 @deadmau5 do you need to be reminded that you would be pointless if it wasn't for molly and ecstasy ?  deadmau5 ‚úî @deadmau5  @djdaze i'd give up my entire career to remove the fucking rampant stupidity thats plagued my favorite type of music in an INSTANT. 26 Mar 12 ReplyRetweetFavorite ""I can appriciate her meteoric career, and all good deeds done, but WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT?"" he added on Facebook. ""That's your big contribution to EDM? Thats your big message to ultra attendies? hipsterspeak for looking for drugs? fuck off you fucking IDIOT.""  In a follow-up blog post, Zimmerman clarified his remarks and insisted that the discussion was about responsibility. Responding to criticism that he was a hypocrite for having smoked cigarrettes while live-streaming from his studio, Zimmerman said never tries to make his ""vices"" look cool or appealing, especially to his younger fans.  He also expressed concern about what comments like Madonna do to the EDM community:  It really hurts me to see rampant ADVOCATION of extreme bullshit lifestyles to a genre that spans pretty much any age gap these days ... I just feel like ive been kicked in the balls for a dollar. I‚Äôve always been into electronic music, as far back as i can remember‚Ä¶ and around the beginning, i really do remember the times the events i loved were pretty much outlawed by my city simply due to its speculated over-excessive drug use, and the media coverage that everyone loves to lap up around it. Yeah, that bummed me out‚Ä¶ kinda made me feel like‚Ä¶ how could something so damn interesting, artful, fun and just plain cool, be frowned upon by most‚Ä¶. but look at us now, allthough not completely, and never like to be completely, the dark veil has been lifted slightly and the music and good times and technology is starting to shine through more and more than ‚Äúthe latest breaking news about such and such a drug found only at these underground TECHNO RAVES - Tonight on fox!‚Äù  Zimmerman recently collaborated with Chris James, a fan who submitted vocals for Zimmerman's new song, ""The Veldt,"" on Twitter. Since Zimmerman has taken to live-streaming any work he does in his new home studio, the entire process was captured on camera. After being inspired by James' lyrics, Zimmerman took to his blog to explain why he shuns collaborations with big name artists in favor of more organic projects like ""The Veldt.""",‚úî

From the Fender site: [The Jazz Bass¬Æ Guitar: A History and Appreciation](http://www.fender.com/news/index.php?display_article=503)  The Jazz Bass has been an instrument of choice for some of the most creative minds and talented hands in music, making its sound a ubiquitous presence in popular music for five decades now. Even a short list of players known for the using the instrument is most impressive‚ÄîJoe Osborn, Jack Casady, Noel Redding, Larry Graham, Herbie Flowers, Greg Lake, Jaco Pastorius, John Paul Jones, Sting, Geddy Lee, Marcus Miller, Flea, Ron Blair, Adam Clayton and Verdine White.  When you‚Äôre listening to the Jimi Hendrix Experience, Sly &amp; the Family Stone, Emerson Lake and Palmer, Led Zeppelin, the Police, Rush, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers and U2, you are very often listening to a Jazz Bass.  When you hear the breathtaking bass breaks by John Entwistle on the Who‚Äôs immortal ‚ÄúMy Generation,‚Äù by John Paul Jones in Led Zeppelin‚Äôs ‚ÄúGood Times Bad Times‚Äù and by Geddy Lee in Rush‚Äôs ‚ÄúYYZ,‚Äù you‚Äôre hearing a Jazz Bass.

The even spookier psychedelic blues parts woven by Jones into Zeppelin‚Äôs ‚ÄúDazed and Confused‚Äù and by U.K. session great Herbie Flowers into David Bowie‚Äôs ‚ÄúSpace Oddity‚Äù? A Jazz Bass. Even great bassists who aren‚Äôt widely known as Fender players have used the Jazz Bass at one time or another‚ÄîPaul McCartney is known to have played a left-handed model on The Beatles (the ‚ÄúWhite Album‚Äù), and Yes-man Chris Squire includes one in his arsenal.  And then there‚Äôs funk, soul and disco. An entirely new way of playing a bass guitar‚Äîthe irresistibly funky and technically sophisticated slap-and-pop bass odyssey pioneered by Larry Graham in the 1960s with Sly &amp; the Family Stone‚Äîwas launched with a Jazz Bass. Among the great many notable exponents to play the Jazz this way, standouts include William ‚ÄúBootsy‚Äù Collins, who played his with James Brown in the 1960s before making bass history with Parliament-Funkadelic in the 1970s; Verdine White with hit factory Earth, Wind &amp; Fire; and Michael ‚ÄúFlea‚Äù Balzary, who often used his 1961 Jazz Bass to bring the style to prominence in modern rock music with the Red Hot Chili Peppers.",¬Æ

t5_2s837,ahnold11,1332873039,"Oh totally, your reaction to the game is very reasonable.  There are a lot of people already invested in the Elder Scrolls experience, who forget what it might be like to someone starting it for the first time.  On paper, Skyrim really seems like a boring skeleton of a game. Weak combat, Weak Story, weak characters (I'm being a little harsh here), not a ton of actual gameplay variety.  And yet, it is hugely popular, because few games give you that ""sense of place"" the feeling that you are in a fully realized world (even if it's an illusion), that there is stuff going on around you.  It's not your typical immersion/atmosphere like in a say a Bioshock, but something more su btle, and yet also stronger.  You want to be a part of that world, and you generally get the feeling that you want to do *things* in that world, just to be a part, just to immerse yourself in it. Even if any of those individual things on their own, isn't that compelling.  On the PC this gets even stronger, as with mods you can really add layers of depth to the game, and even address some of the gameplay shortcomings.  You hit the nail right on the head with the comment that you are in the Driver's seat. It's a core philosophy of the game, to basically always give you choice (not branching linear narrative story choice), but the choice to consume as little or as much in the game at whatever pace you choose.  It comes at a (unavoidable) cost though, since you can ""do everything"" in the game, at essentially any point. You can get into situations which are a bit far fetched (Someone has been captured and needs to be saved, but then I went off for 6 months and did a whole bunch of other stuff, and when I came back they are still waiting as if not a single second went past.)  They world isn't terribly dynamic, and doesn't react/tailo itself to what you do, but you get to do any/all of what you want, and are never locked out of anything.  Many people have trouble with the above as the lack of structure (or forced structure/pacing rather) means it's easy to wander off, get distracted, do a bunch of cool things, but not feel like you are making any connected/meaningful progress/purpose, and eventually drift away from the game.  You experienced that in your first 45mins, and in a way are lucky, because you can see that now, and if you go back, make a concentrated effort to stay on task (at least for the first little while) and hopefully have a really enjoyable experience.  Personally, the above really doesn't bother me. I spent 150hrs in the previous Game (Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion) and only made it maybe 1hr into the main story.  IT didn't matter because I really enjoyed the sense of the world, didn't plenty of interesting things, saw lots of places. It was fun, I enjoyed it, and the experience was like none other I've had in a video game.  (I tried going back years later, with the goal to ""finish the story this time"" with a new character, but only made it about 4hrs into the main story heh).  Heck I've probably played 4chars in Skyrim so far, about the same 150hrs, and there are still two whole cities I have yet to visit.  But I'm a bit of a special case, in that for me this game the story is less important, I get game stories in many other games, but in this one I get a sense of place, and a freedom to consume that place at any place/order I see fit.  You can hear many people say things like ""It's not the main story in Skyrim that is important, it's your story"", or ""Skyrim Stories¬Æ"" etc.  While it's not exactly like that (there isn't much of substance outside of game narrative that really cohesively holds together) there is some truth to it. The game has enough systems that you can set personal ""goals"" for yourself.  Tasks to accomplish.  ""Climb xxx tall mountain"".  ""Find yyy sword that gives an awesome special benefit"". ""Figure out the ingredients to get a cool invisibility potion"". ""Steal that guards cool shield"" ""Make an entire outfit of clothing that doubles what I can sell my goods for to shop keepers"".  Those tasks and the sense of accomplishment, coupled with the feeling that you are in the world, makes you feel like you have had meaningful (entertaining) experiences, that people like to label ""My Story"".  You can also make stuff up in your head and Role Play motivations, but that is a different topic all together ;)",¬Æ

t5_2rfec,redliza,1332921440,"The big ones are Skyrim, Portal 2, and Bioshock.  I haven't actually played Bioshock (I youtubed it because I hate survival horror), but it was a big thing critically and probably worth a look just so you can see how it influenced all the other games you'll be catching up on. Even though it's a shooter, the DRM makes this something I'd rather buy on a console than a PC.  Skyrim is just huge because it's a great series that goes five years between sequels. That said, it is actually so amazing that the hype is justified. I'm like 250 hours into my first of many characters, seriously. The only way I can describe this one is that it's extremely similar to Oblivion, so if you played that, you know if you'll love or hate Skyrim. Skyrim should be for PC, so you can get mods. (Unless you have an irrational hatred of mods. Then get it for a console, because the PC interface really sucks.)  Portal 2 is just the funniest game I've ever played. Play Portal first.  Otherwise? I don't remember exactly when Mirror's Edge came out, but it was pretty cool. Not a huge thing you missed, but a neat game I'd recommend. I like the art style, the movement has a great flow to it, and it managed to do a lot of things right with its main characters that other games seem to struggle with. It has the same DRM problems as Bioshock, but seemed to me like something that would work on a console. (I played on someone else's PC.)  If you played Halo and Halo 2, you may as well Finish The Fight‚Ñ¢. It was as good as the first two games. I'm not so big on the other couple of games they made after it. They were fun but were still more Halo games for the sake of more Halo games.  Though I don't know much about them, apparently the Mass Effect trilogy has been doing all sorts of new and innovative things that people love. So they're probably great choices if you want to make up for missing not just games, but the conversations that have been held about games. Mass Effect 3 is probably the game gamers care most about currently. There's some hilarious news coming out of people's reactions to the ending. (So by the way, spoilers abound right now.)  If you are big on multiplayer, I think Left4Dead was after Soul Caliber IV. Most people are on to Left4Dead 2 by now, which I haven't played, but if you have an actual group of friends to play with they probably still have Left4Dead itself. I enjoyed it even though it has all sorts of things I normally hate in games.  I think the last fighter I played was a demo of Tekken that came with my PSX, so I can't help there.",‚Ñ¢

Engineering bay starts up, and it looks like MKP's going to go for some VERY fast upgrades, going for a super heavy marine style build (staying true to his name.) Two reactors going down on two of the barracks, a tech lab on the third, and a factory starts up. Zenio's tossing down a roach warren, looks like he's doing SOMETHING, because there are SIXTEEN roaches on the way!! Marineking's not going to know about this, he's going to have stim and +1 against the mass roach, which isn't going to be the best scenario for Zenio. Zenio's not going to bother engaging the army as he sees it moving out, he's trying to force a base trade right now! Marineking loses all the SCV's at the expannsion, and thare are no combat shields coming out for MarineKing and OWCH. ONE moment of bad control means that MarineKing's push gets cleaned up, and it's hard to say who came out on top there! The zerg is ahead 15 workers , but Marineking has units, he's got a wall, and he still has his natural, and Zenio lost his expansion. Marineking with a drop into the main, doing MASSIVE damage, killing ALL the lings and blings, and MarineKing's just microing the HELL out of this drop, making it SO SO efficient, and there's the GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG!! MarineKing!! ‚ô•  ###### GG MarineKing_Prime!  ---  Game 2: [Atlantis Spaceship] --- ---  I've actually never seen this map before o.o Badass!  MarineKing starts off with another one rax expand, transitioning into reactored hellions for the map control. Nice, solid opening coming out here for Marineking, and it'll pretty much just allow him  to go wherever he wants in the tree and not afraid of anything. Marineking's starting up a second factory here! Oooh, this'll be an interesting choice. He's adding on a tech lab on his second factory, so it's going to be a fast blue flame hellion push!  MKP isn't goint to let Zenio see what he's doing here, but Zenio has some nice game sense, getting THREE spines at the front already, just in case, and Zenio's going to use those to push out his creep, makiing a VERY good defensive line. And there MKP goes, running past the spines, the hellions are in the main and there are the roasted drones, the roasted queens, a lotta transfuses being used, all the blings die off, a second queen dies, and the zerglings are just going to get fried, Zenio gets a nice surround and kills off the hellions, but MKP with a NICE transition into heavy mech. MKP has a third base down, already getting his FOURTH (10:30), MKP has 2 armouries and getting double vehicle upgrades, he's getting two more factories and just building up his heavy metal.   Marineking still holding Map control with those hellions, he sees that the third is out for Zenio with a scouting barracks, and MKP just harassing, showing hellions near the third to force the drones away, just the mindgames. Oooooh! Neural parasite starting up for Zenio!!! I don't see this NEARLY enough, and it's the perfect response by Zenio. Zenio starting off his fourth, but he's going to lose it almost instantly, nad there's a MASSIVE hellion push to the third, they're all going to get fungalled and OWCH. Marineking has four bases established, he's expanding TWICE more and he's HEAVILY out-expanding the zerg player!  There's a massive engagement at the zerg's front, but Zenio's just going to lose EVERYTHING. Marineking with 6 thors and a TON of hellions, the hellions are going to easily rip through the zergling count, the thors will take care of the rest. There should have been some better neurals - only 2 neurals go down, and those infestors are easily taken out. Good game MKP!!!  ###### GG MarineKing_Prime!",‚ô•

t5_2qh5b,blazingtruth,1332945293,"&gt;There's nothing in their essence or potentialities/potencies that dispositions them to exist (existence is not a predicate)  Specifically, dispositional essentialism (DE) is the *theory* that:  1. All fundamental properties are potencies ‚Äì there are no (fundamental) categorical natural properties. 2. The laws of nature are consequences of the existence of potencies. 3. The laws of nature are necessary.  &gt;In another they necessarily (or rather, deductively) follow from the existence of those (like a systems approach).  Au contraire. DE arguably follows from Kripke's findings, as the claim that ""All fundamental properties are potencies"" is a necessary, synthetic, a posteriori truth. The subject concept ""fundamental properties"" does not contain the predicate concept ""potencies"".  ----  **WARNING: MODAL LOGIC AHEAD!**  Dispositional essentialism suggests that in all possible wolds, any object that possesses P is disposed to yield M in response to S. That is represented as the following:  (DEp) ‚Ä¶ ‚ñ°(Px‚ÜíD(S,M)x).  And, also, this is a conditional analysis (CA), which is nothing but a logical equivalence:  (CA‚ñ°) ‚Ä¶ ‚ñ°(D(S,M)x ‚Üî Sx ‚ñ°‚ÜíMx)  So, let P be a potency, i.e. some property with a dispositional essence, as in (DEp) above. Combine (DEp) with (CA‚ñ°) and we have:  (I) ‚Ä¶ ‚ñ°(Px‚Üí(Sx‚ñ°‚ÜíMx)).  Let x acquire the stimulus S, i.e.  (II) ‚Ä¶ Px&amp;Sx  By (I) and (II) we have:  (III) ‚Ä¶ Mx  Discharging (II) we have:  (IV) ‚Ä¶ (Px&amp;Sx)‚ÜíMx.  Since x is arbitrary we may generalize:  (V) ‚Ä¶ ‚àÄx((Px&amp;Sx) ‚ÜíMx  Since (V) holds in an arbitrary world w it is necessary:  (V‚ñ°) ‚Ä¶ ‚ñ°(‚àÄx((Px&amp;Sx) ‚ÜíMx)  Which yields the conclusion:  (PNL) At least some of the laws of nature are metaphysically necessary. Then, further argumentation leads to a universality of PNL to the strong necessitarian form.  ---- &gt;If the question is posed of those particles themselves then I can see where DE comes in, saying that the essential properties of these particles dispositions them to behave in a certain manner.  The concern is with fundamental properties, yes.   &gt; There's nothing in their essence or potentialities/potencies that dispositions them to exist (existence is not a predicate)  Bird deals with this nicely, and responds to two arguments TLA (too little actuality) and TMP (too much potentiality) here: http://eis.bris.ac.uk/~plajb/research/papers/Potency_and_Modality.pdf  Here's another nice paper by Quentin Smith about common objections to DE and how an essentialist would respond (the most common of which comes from an ignorance of Kripke): http://logica.ugent.be/philosophica/fulltexts/67-3.pdf  ",‚Üî

If five users like the comment and three users don't it will have a score of 2. Please note that the vote numbers are not ""real"" numbers, they have been ""fuzzed"" to prevent spam bots etc. So taking the above example, if five users upvoted the comment, and three users downvote it, the upvote/downvote numbers may say 23 upvotes and 21 downvotes, or 12 upvotes, and 10 downvotes. The points score is correct, but the vote totals are ""fuzzed"".

t5_2qh6c,LoststarWaffles,1332984622,"First time in [/r/Christianity](/r/Christianity) , so hi all!  First off, I would consider myself an Agnostic Athiest, but if I reflect, I guess I'm more of a Agnostic Theist.   As a kid, I was never pressured into any sorts of religion. I never went to church, and my parents weren't too religious. They would have the occasionally, oh hey there might be something out there, so just be a good person, but that was more of them talking to me about morals, rather than be good under god. I thought about it occasionally as a kid, but never too deeply. I never formed a relationship with Jesus. I never saw the appeal of worshiping someone who is dead to take your sins away. What truly made him better than anyone else? Another thing that sort of pushed me in my path is how religion is viewed. Again, I don't care for seeing a guy on a cross. Why do I want to look at a guy dying. Why do I care to see a woman praying? Its just these questions I asked myself to never really get pushed into Christianity. I didn't see Christianity over any other religion. What made God, Yahweh, Allah, or Zues, or any other god or goddess the right ones? Why does it matter so much that your going to hate the next guy, and what they believe.  Although it probably shouldn't, it also frustrates me to see my Christian friends to talk about Jesus, and how great he is. Your religion is yours, but I just feel awkward and out of place when I just hear about it. They show this undying love for someone they haven't met. They talk about how they won't do anything bad. ""Being sober and having God in my life and a fabulous family is the highest I have ever been in life and I LOVE LOVE it ‚ô•"", but then I see them turn right around and talk crap about one of their friends. I just get this contradiction in my head, how can someone say they are happy and then hurt someone else. Its stuff like this that keeps me away from any religion. It makes me realize everyday how there are people that consider themselves true believers under a religion, but just go out and contradict it, or just force it upon others.  Another one of my friends has this rationale that America was founded purely on religion, that the founding fathers specifically wanted Christianity as the religion of America. It also pushes me away from religion that no matter what I do, I would not be able to convince this friend that he is wrong, that the founders of America specifically wanted the country to be free for all, not just strict Christians. I never said anything to him, because I feel he was too set in his ways to make a good argument to show him.  I sorta went off on a couple tangents about my friends, and probably didn't make sense in some parts, but its just a subject of religion in all I have strong opinions against. For those reading, didn't mean to target Christianity specifically, but that's what I grew up around. I feel the same way about all religions,  I don't have any problem against you believing what you want to believe, as long as you aren't spouting it out to the world as if yours is the best. I'm probably contradicting myself somewhere along but, Live life how you want to, and how you want to have fun, but don't spoil it for others, but be accepting as well, others have their own lives to live as well. Live by the Golden Rule or whatever.  TL;DR : Parents not to religious, grew up thinking for myself of what would be out there or not. Came to my own conclusion of ""eh, theres probably something, but who cares, I'm here, I'll live my life on here and try not worrying about the next.""",‚ô•

t5_2qxih,Mc808,1333038601,"Where would you start if you were constructing the Skywalker family tree? Let‚Äôs start with Anakin. If you ask me, Anakin is a level 50 Sith Warrior anchoring the top of the family tree. He‚Äôs married to Padme Amidala and they have two kids, Luke and Leia. Luke and Leia were both strong in the Force, like their father before them. Leia ends up marrying Han Solo, undoubtedly a level 50 Smuggler, and they have three children who all turn out to be Jedi. Luke marries Mara Jade, and they in turn have Ben, who is also a powerful Jedi Knight. Looking at their family tree, it‚Äôs clear that the Skywalker legacy produces powerful Force users and great heroes.  From the very beginning of development on Star Wars‚Ñ¢: The Old Republic‚Ñ¢, we felt that the idea of familial bonds was a cornerstone of the Star Wars‚Ñ¢ experience. In this blog, I‚Äôm going to explore what that means and what rewards are waiting for the characters in your Legacy, as well as exploring the design philosophy behind the changes we made.  You may have already started your Legacy by picking a Legacy Name. This happens when you finish Chapter 1 with your first character. From this point, all of your characters on that server are now considered part of your Legacy, regardless of faction. This means that any existing characters which have not been played past Chapter 1 will gain a Legacy Name, and any newly created characters will also have their Legacy Name available from character creation.  From Game Update 1.2: Legacy, unlocking your Legacy grants you access to a newly expanded Legacy Panel (accessed, by default, by pressing the ‚ÄòY‚Äô key) where you can modify your family tree, and see what Legacy Rewards you have unlocked.  Your Legacy‚Äôs bloodlines are constructed on the family tree page, where you can see all of the characters that are part of your Legacy, and drag them into place according to their relationship to each other. Want your Smuggler‚Äôs father to be your Sith Warrior? Maybe your Agent is a noted rival of your Trooper? Your Consular‚Äôs brother is an Inquisitor? It‚Äôs all possible, as your characters can be linked together in any combination as siblings, spouses, adopted children, children, rivals and allies. We hope that players use the family tree as a way to better roleplay their characters, visualize their relationships, and craft stories about their lineage.  But what do your characters learn from each other? Fathers pass family knowledge down to their sons. Allies share information with each other. Even rivals must learn everything about their foes in order to know their enemies. Likewise, the characters in your Legacy will be able to earn global unlocks, which are abilities, emotes, and other rewards shared across all characters in your Legacy. If one character unlocks something, all characters, regardless of familial relationship, earn the same unlock. Let‚Äôs look at different categories of unlocks.  **Class Unlocks**  When characters in your Legacy reach important story milestones, they can pass down special emotes and abilities to other characters in your Legacy. On completing Chapter 2 with a character, your characters gain the use of an emote unique to that class. For example, if you finish Chapter 2 with your Inquisitor, you unlock an emote which causes your character to throw lightning between his hands. Again, all characters in your Legacy can use this emote. Likewise, at completion of Chapter 2, your characters unlock the ability to apply that class‚Äô unique buff along with their own. For example, if you complete Chapter 2 with an Agent, and then create a Bounty Hunter, when you use the ability Hunter‚Äôs Boon it also applies the effects of the Agent‚Äôs Coordination buff.  After one of your characters completes Chapter 3, that character gets to pass on a special ‚ÄòHeroic Ability‚Äô to all the characters in his Legacy. Powerful Sith Warrior in your Legacy? His Jedi children can ""Force Choke"" enemies. Father was a high ranking Imperial Agent? Call in some old favors and request ""Orbital Strikes"" from Imperial warships. Your sister is a notorious Smuggler? She taught you that‚Ä¶ special‚Ä¶ kick that only Smugglers know.  Some of you may be concerned about Heroic Abilities making the game unbalanced or just looking wrong if used frequently. We had this in mind during development, so as a result Heroic Abilities can only be used while you are using your class‚Äô Heroic Moment ability. These are abilities you already have that require an active companion to use and that currently boost your regeneration while active, allowing you to take on tougher opponents.  By requiring you to use these abilities with a companion present, we ensure that people who play multiple characters do not gain an advantage during the end game or in Warzones. By also only allowing Heroic Abilities during the brief window of time that a Heroic Moment ability is active, they remain a relatively rare occurrence. You won‚Äôt see Jedi running around spamming Force Choke all the time.  Heroic Abilities are very useful for leveling up new characters, for taking on tough bosses and PvE content as well as being handy roleplaying additions. Our intention is not to upset end game balance with them, and hopefully you will agree.  **Companion Unlocks**  When you complete all possible conversations and quests with a companion, you receive a companion unlock that is granted to all characters in your Legacy.  The first companion you unlock of each companion combat archetype (ranged tank, ranged DPS, melee tank, melee DPS, and healer) gives you a unique unlock for that companion type that grants a passive stat bonus. These first-time archetype unlocks also modify the duration and cooldown times for your Heroic Moment ability. This ensures that a single character can potentially attain the full range of companion stat boosts and Heroic Moment modifiers, while also ensuring that a player who has severely mistreated one companion can get that unlock by playing an alternate character.  For example, a Sith Warrior who has mistreated Vette may find it extremely hard to get her unlock, but unlocking any other ranged DPS companion on any other character will grant the same archetype unlock. Additional companions unlocked beyond the five combat archetypes grant a passive bonus to your Presence stat, increasing the power of your companion characters.  **Species Unlocks**  Can Sith Purebloods ever find a path to the light side? Is a Miralukan‚Äôs Force sight good enough to fire a sniper rifle with any accuracy? Do Mirialans make for good Sith Inquisitors as well as Jedi Consulars? With Legacy species unlocks, you can tell those stories with your own characters. Playing a character of any species to level 50 unlocks that character‚Äôs species as an option at character creation for all classes. All combinations of class and species are now possible given the right unlocks. Opening these new combinations gives much more freedom at character creation. By having to earn these unlocks, instead of just allowing all combinations by default, we ensure that combinations like Jedi Pureblood are still uncommon, and require someone to have invested time in a Sith Pureblood Legacy to attain them.  Additionally, if you unlock a species like Cyborg that has unique customization options per class, you open up all possible customization options for every class. Your new Cyborg Smuggler can have the Agent‚Äôs cybernetic eyepieces, or the sinister looking facial cybernetics of the Sith Warrior.  If you have enough credits and a high enough Legacy Level, you may also unlock additional species combos by purchasing them for a large number of credits. The cost for bypassing the unlock requirements is high, but it allows players who may have played a human to 50 and beyond a chance to start their next character as the species and class of their choice if they have the credits to spare.  **Ship Unlocks**  By attaining high enough Legacy Levels and spending credits, players will be able to purchase unlockable items for their ship. Wish you could pick up your mail on your ship? There‚Äôs a mailbox you can purchase if you are the right Legacy Level and spend a few credits. Neutral Galactic Trade Network Terminal? Better be ready to shell out some credits for that one! Wish that you could love your ship‚Äôs protocol droid even more than you already do? A new astromech you can acquire for your ship sells unique sensor modules for your beloved C2-N2 or 2V-R8 that give him crafting specializations, just the same as your other companions. In case that‚Äôs not enough, the astromech also repairs items and buys your junk!  As with all unlocks attained through the Legacy System, when you acquire something on one character, you acquire it for all your characters. That means what a new character in your Legacy gets their ship, they will climb on board for the first time to find all of your purchases already in place and waiting.  **Other Unlocks**  Unlocks are also awarded for reaching important alignment milestones, hitting different valor and social levels, and others are purchasable just by reaching a given legacy level and spending credits. Players unlocking Valor rewards will get some new, special unarmed combat abilities used for dueling other players. Players unlocking Social rewards will be dancing the night away with their companions using the new Companion Dance ability, and will receive new emotes that will have your characters using tools and tech devices. Players with credits to spare can buy down the cooldown time of Quick Travel and Emergency Fleet Pass for added convenience, or get the ""Rocket Boost"" ability that gives their characters an additional very fast sprint. (Hint: Rocket Boost is just a poorly scrambled anagram of Rocket Boots. If you‚Äôre sporting a jetpack on your back, the jets will fire out of there instead!)",‚Ñ¢

My search for the meaning of America led me to consider an array of issues often as contradictory as the reasons why people vote, some as diverse as the ethnic antecedents of its citizenry and others which could be considered inflammatory.  As much as one can glean from the ‚Äúnewsertainment‚Äù we are bombarded with, like the annoying frequency of automobile commercials, we have serious issues in America:  A continuing world-wide potentially catastrophic financial crisis which various governments allegedly try to fix but without cooperation from the financial services industry which caused the crisis.  A war in Afghanistan waged, it is to be hoped, for reasons better than protecting 90% of the world‚Äôs opium/heroin production and smuggling and guaranteeing the continued corruption of the Karzai administration.  A presidential nominating campaign which, in its early stages, sadly shows all the signs of a pending ‚Äúmaturity‚Äù notable only for negativity, nastiness and waste of money which, alas, the American electorate predictably and mindlessly loves.   A never before seen national epidemic in illegal drug trafficking from/through Mexico, our number one trading partner, the resulting drug addiction and drug related crime in America so monstrous it has all but neutralized our federal, state and local law enforcement.  If this isn‚Äôt terrorist activity waged by a foreign country against America, what is?  A system of education that often doesn‚Äôt educate and is continually downsized by budget-cutting state and local governments.  Racial Prejudice which is still the cornerstone of the ‚ÄúAmerican Dilemma‚Äù followed closely by religious intolerance.  Unparalleled child neglect, abuse and sexual exploitation.   The plague of Sexually Transmitted Disease which if not stopped may prevent generations of Americans from producing children.  Twenty-five percent of all American women are sexually molested.  Despite the ‚Äúgood‚Äù news about the American economy there are ever growing numbers of homeless, hungry, unemployed and despondent American men, women and children and this includes far too many Vets. By contrast to this terrifying growth, the numbers of billionaires, alas, show a small increase to where there are only twelve-hundred.

The other doctor told me I could try 6mp. Another immunosuppressive with increased risk of infection, but after doing some research it seemed less scary. I ended up choosing 6MP.   A few months later, my diet was cleaned up; I was feeling good with no symptoms. Then I got on a plane for a 2 week business trip to another country. The second I landed I knew something was wrong. My Crohns was back. (In my situation stress triggers my symptoms more than anything.)  Once I returned home, I consulted with another GI and we decided it was time to get on Remicade. I finally had my first infusion today. Keeping my fingers crossed it works.    There was really one big reason as to why I decided to start Remicade this time around:  I felt pressured by my first GI to start the drug, but my new doctor handle it completely different. This time the decision was mine and he was only there to present the facts and answer any questions. In addition to that, he offered two other treatment options.  He explained everything to me. Even mention the following (According to my doctor about 50 cases to date): ‚ÄúPostmarketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma, a rare type of T-cell lymphoma, have been reported in patients treated with TNF blockers, including REMICADE¬Æ. These cases have had a very aggressive disease course and have been fatal. All reported REMICADE¬Æ cases have occurred in patients with Crohn‚Äôs disease or ulcerative colitis and the majority were in adolescent and young adult males. All of these patients had received treatment with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine concomitantly with REMICADE¬Æ at or prior to diagnosis. Carefully assess the risks and benefits of treatment with REMICADE¬Æ, especially in these patient types. ‚Äú   I‚Äôm a 24 male so when he told me this I was terrified, but I was desperate to feel better. At this point the benefits outweighed the risks.   Remicade can change peoples lives, it was FDA approved in 1998 and more than 1.3 million people worldwide have already taken it. It could be right for you. Lol sorry if I sound like a salesperson. I really hope you start feeling better soon. Starting a new med is really scary stuff. I‚Äôve taken methotrexate, 6mp, and now remicade. I have no idea  what the future holds, but I‚Äôm much happier when my crohns is at bay.   Hang in there!!  source for quote: http://www.remicade.com/hcp/home",¬Æ

Both lost in their own thoughts as they walked past the stores in the strip mall.  ‚ÄúSo, are you some kind of Prophet?‚Äù Asked Mark.  ‚ÄúI dunno.‚Äù Vance pulled his knit cap over his ears. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve looked everywhere for information; the Internet, the library, the church.

As Mark went down, the window to the jewelry store exploded. The chair used to shatter the glass sailed where he stood a split second before. He froze as two masked gunmen came through the now nonexistent window.  Vance quickly rolled onto the balls of his feet. Like lightning, he leaped in the air, spun backwards and extended his leg. The heel of his boot met firmly with the temple of the first man. The robber crumpled in to a heap.  This placed the second man behind Vance. He raised his pistol, pointed it at Vance, and pulled the trigger.  Vance dropped into a crouch, the bullet flying harmlessly over his head. He kicked back, crushing the bandit‚Äôs kneecap. The gun fell to the ground as the robber collapsed in pain.  Vance looked at Mark, in shock, but unhurt on the ground inches away from the carnage. ‚ÄúMark, don‚Äôt let them know it was me!‚Äù Vance ran around the corner of the building and quickly disappeared.  Mark mumbled, still amazed by what happened, ""You're no Prophet, you're a Superhero.""  Sirens pierced the air and in moments police had the gunmen in handcuffs and were questioning witnesses.  ‚ÄúYou were closest to the action,‚Äù the cop asked Mark. ‚ÄúDid you see who that guy was?‚Äù  ‚ÄúIt was Va‚Ä¶um‚Ä¶‚Äù Mark stammered. ‚ÄúHis name is Vatic‚Äù   **¬©2005 by Icepigs**",¬©

UI       General          Players can now add other players to their friends list even if they are offline.

t5_2qh35,kqr,1333152608,"I'm of the opinion that if you write Correct and Good‚Ñ¢ code, you shouldn't be able to tell a dynamically typed language apart from a statically typed, and you should always strive to write correct code. Also, I think you should be able to force compilation through the type warnings, with the compiler just replacing the offending lines with something throwing a TypeError exception or whatnot.  Although I have to admit I can't envision a scenario when I would like to force the compilation in spite of the warnings. I can't see when and why I would think something like, ""What I need right now is some code that will crash if it hits this point in the execution. That would really make things simpler and more clear."" It's simpler and more clear to just fix the type error so that the program works even when it hits the spot where there previously was an error.  I understand you wanting to post-pone the bugfixing and whatnot, but every type error I've had have been due to a logic error in my mind. Something that have broken the algorithm or whatever I'm trying to do. Something that really shouldn't be in the program, and makes the program do the wrong things for the right input. I could run the program, take note of the wonky result and then try to figure out what went wrong, or I could simply iron out the type errors directly.  Your last point is valid however. And as far as I've gathered, Lisps macros would be really hard to statically typecheck. So there sure are benefits you can get in a dynamically typed language, but I still feel there's something missing when my compiler doesn't tell me something's wrong when it clearly is.",‚Ñ¢

t5_2qorf,KissYourButtGoodbye,1333182131,"&gt;I'll say it again: you cannot bring up 'lost potential sales' until you establish that copyrights and patents are indeed the same as real property.  Again, intellectual property is property in the same way as any other. If I take my labor and ""mix"" it with resources (those used to produce the information), then it is my property. This doesn't stop working because it is digital property.  I like how you ignored that argument entirely.   &gt;Oh, holy shit! So you agree with me that an invention, idea, etc. are not property?  No.  Patents function very differently from copyright, and you continue to ignore that by lumping everything together as ""IP"".  You also neglect the subset that is trademark, which I would classify as fraud by attempting to pass off a product as produced by someone when it is not.  &gt;I'm not trying to rebut Rothbard, I'm defending my own position that copyrights are not property.  And I argued, using Rothbard's freely provided arguments, that they are.  You have to refute those arguments to show they are not.  To quote him once more:  &gt; Let us consider copyright. A man writes a book or composes music. When he publishes the book or sheet of music, he imprints on the first page the word ‚Äúcopyright.‚Äù This indicates that any man who agrees to purchase this product also agrees as part of the exchange *not* to recopy or reproduce this work for sale. In other words, the author does not sell his property out¬≠right to the buyer; he sells it *on condition* that the buyer not reproduce it for sale. Since the buyer does not buy the property outright, but only on this condition, any infringement of the con¬≠tract by him or a subsequent buyer is *implicit theft* and would be treated accordingly on the free market. The copyright is there¬≠fore a logical device of property right on the free market.  And the patent is only incompatible *insofar as it extends beyond the copyright protection of information to the barring of similar, or even identical, productions independently arrived at with no knowledge of the ""original"" production*.  &gt;The point of contention is that I am not allowed to use my property to transcribe your poem without your permission. My property rights have been restricted.  No more than any restrictions against other forms of theft of property.  You cannot use your car to transport my property back to your residence.  That is a restriction on your use of your property.  And yet, this is sensible and just.  &gt;You are free to keep it out of the public, but once it is out there, it is free reign.  This line of reasoning would also result in everything in the ""public"" domain being free reign - including physical objects in stores.  There is no ""public"" - there are a series of private systems, all of which would have justly acquired the information I produced by agreeing to my contractual copyright.  &gt;You literally have a copyright of your paragraphs that you just wrote.  No, I don't.  Part of the agreement to use reddit limits my copyright on what I post here.  And more accurately, you have followed copyright anyway by citing them as my words and quoting them.  &gt;I can make a copy, and you still have your original pdf.  That is still theft.  You are conflating the information content - something which was produced through the mixing of labor and resources, and *is therefore property* - with the digital medium it is conveyed through.  Assume, for a moment, that there was no copyright protections enforced by the State.  Assume further that I, as a producer, require everyone to sign (or otherwise agree to) a contract that stipulates that  their use of the information I produced is limited, so they cannot copy it to sell or give to another (except for small excerpts for a limited subset of uses with appropriate citation).  Effectively, this contract functions no differently than current copyright law.  Is this not acceptable protection of the result of my labor (i.e. my *property*)?  And if this is the case, why is a law (under monopolistic law or not) recognizing ¬© as the indication of that agreement practically different?",¬©

t5_2sir4,idioma,1333195532,"&gt; Yes, let's point to a 3rd world country and use that as ammunition against the libertarian principles the US was founded on.  ""The founding fathers are on my side of the argument!""  I‚Äôve heard this one before.  Everyone wants the founders to be on their side of the argument. The fact of the matter is, the founders were a contentious lot that rarely had sweeping consensus on any matter. The US Constitution is a collection of compromise reluctantly written as a draft to establish some rule of law. It was never intended to be the last word, or to be left unmodified. Men who lived two centuries ago (and owned slaves) are not in a position to determine what is best for right now. They knew that they were flawed men without perfect knowledge and were pretty clear in their intentions to allow for a flexible government capable of modification as needed.  &gt; I've seen other liberal-minded folks mention this ""historically low"" income tax percentage.  ""Facts have a librul[sic] bias!""  Yeah, those [‚Äúliberals‚Äù]( http://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/eliminating-oil-subsidies-two-cheers-president-obama) at the Cato Institute happen to agree with me on the issue of eliminating oil subsidies. But we all know how left-wing the Cato Institute can be, Amirite?  At least in this one regard, you are more to the right than the Cato Institute, your father must be very proud of you.  &gt; Again, I'll simply ask you at what point does the US government become accountable for its budget?  It is accountable. Congress must approve a budget in order to spend or borrow money. Every year, the US continues to honor its debts and pays what is owed as bonds mature. This is a combination of short-term and long-term debt obligations. The 10-year Treasury Note (10YT) is currently 2.03%. In other words, the US Treasury is able to sell bonds that actually lose value over their term when factoring in the USD annual inflation rate of 2.9%.   The existing debt is extremely costly when considering the amount of interest paid each year ($454 Billion), and having to borrow money due to revenue shortages is extremely wasteful. With this in mind, continuing to allow an expensive series of tax breaks to go to an insanely profitable industry like Domestic Oil Production is not in anyone‚Äôs interest except for the executives of those oil companies.   &gt;  I'm sure you blame those meany Republicans for grabbing Obama's hand and forcing him to sign an extension of the Bush taxcuts too.  How dare he be pragmatic in order to actually accomplish something! Republicans would like the tax cuts to be made permanent, Democrats would like them to expire; in order to avoid a government shutdown the tax cuts were temporarily extended for 24 months. That is how compromise works, neither side gets 100% of what they want.  &gt; Well, there's not much in the way of Voluntaryists or AnCaps running for office right now,  Untested fringe Utopians aren't politically popular?! I am shocked.  &gt; so I'll take what I can get.   You'll vote for a Republican, but tell your friends who you *wish* was in charge, right?  &gt; Right now, that boils down to Ron Paul or Gary Johnson.  Ron Paul: Republican  He won't get the nomination, and would lose in a general election. Gary Johnson will likely get significantly less than 10% of the popular vote running as a third party candidate. Voting for either Johnson or Paul is effectively and strategically no different than voting **for** Barack Obama, but it will make you feel better so...  &gt;  I would never in a million years vote for any of Romney, Gingrich, Santorum or Obama, because they represent more of the same status quo garbage we've been getting for many decades.  ""Both Conservatives and Liberals are close-minded Nazis""  ""You should be different; you should be a rebel, an individual, just like me.""  Or I can vote strategically and acknowledge that not getting everything that I want all the time is just part of life. I can then put more pressure on local elections where I have greater influence than in a national contest.  &gt; But given the choice between a large nanny state that spends money like an 18 year old girl with her first credit card, or a foreign policy that isn't responsible for the murder and displacement of millions of people, I'll take the peaceful foreign policy.  Yes, clearly I hate freedom and want the nation to drown in debt, also I find it favorable to murder civilians in other countries. There is no room for doubt, I am a terrible, terrible person.  &gt; I'm antiwar above all else, and no amount of domestic services or ""infrastructure"" at home will validate the mass murder these administrations are accountable for.  ""I'm anti-violence, if you don't agree with me, then you are pro-murder!""  Then why do you live in America? You enjoy the high standard of living reaped from imperialism while simultaneously condemning it. If you truly have a moral objection then you should take advantage of the free market of world governments and migrate to a country that doesn‚Äôt have a military. There are a few dozen to choose from.  Voting for Ron Paul might make you feel good about yourself, but at the end of the day nothing has changed. Libertarians believe in voting with your wallet and with your feet, right? So why not do both? Take your productivity to another country and stop paying taxes here. Somalia hasn‚Äôt had a functioning government for years; you‚Äôd probably love it there. Porto Rico doesn‚Äôt have a military, and this time of year the weather is fantastic. There‚Äôs also Scandinavia, which you might find unfavorable due to their socialistic culture, but you‚Äôd no longer be in allegiance with an aggressor nation that engages in interventionist adventures around the world.   Remember, you said you are antiwar **above all else**. Above. All. Else. I take this to mean nothing else matters as much to you as not engaging in war or contributing to war. Yet here you are, in America, your tax dollars being spent bombing civilians.   &gt; Just because Ron and Rand Paul have an R next to their name doesn't mean they're the same as the other neocons in Congress.  For eight years under G.W. Bush, Ron Paul remained a loyal member of the GOP, he could have left the party in protest when the administration pushed for an invasion of Iraq. He didn‚Äôt. He continued to enjoy the political advantage of being a member of the party in power, and I don‚Äôt remember him challenging Bush in the 2004 election either.  Too bad.  &gt; Similarly, I wouldn't lump guys like Dennis Kucinich or Mike Gravel in with their neocon Democrat cohorts.   Dennis Kucinich is still a member of the Democratic Party. As a member of that party he is just as accountable for their actions as anyone else in his party. If party affiliation didn‚Äôt matter, then why have political parties at all? I‚Äôd probably vote locally from someone like Kucinich since his stances align well with my own, but if that ‚ÄúD‚Äù in front of his name was replaced with an ‚ÄúANP‚Äù (American Nazi Party) I could not longer give him my vote. Affiliation matters.  &gt; Remember, Ron Paul was one of only a handful of Republicans to vote against the war in Iraq, voted against the Patriot Act, opposed the NDAA and opposes unconstitutional drone strikes.  ‚ÄúRon Paul is a beautiful and unique snowflake!‚Äù  He was also one of the only ‚Äúnay‚Äù votes for Martin Luther King Day.   A few things:  - Voting ‚ÄúNo‚Äù on a bill that you know is going to pass anyways might gain you some points politically, but does nothing to change the situation.  - Even a broken wristwatch is right twice a day. Ron Paul is not special for opposing these things; other politicians also manage to stand against these pieces of legislation without being neo-confederate loons, anti-choice, gold bugs, or John Birchers.  - Drone strikes *are* unconstitutional, but so is having an Air-force since technically the founders only approved of an Army and Navy. With or without them, civilians would still be killed during military conflicts, this is nothing new.  &gt; You remember that time that Obama extended the Patriot Act? Yeah.  Who do you think we have to thank for moving the politics in this country so far to the right that even the ‚Äúsocialist, secret muslim from Kenya‚Ñ¢‚Äù as an executive resembles a moderate Republican from thirty years ago? I‚Äôm not here to defend Obama, or to claim that he‚Äôs, like, the best guy ever or something. I‚Äôm not a Cultist or a Utopian, I don‚Äôt need perfection to exist within the choices made available, and I‚Äôm okay with getting less than 100% of what I want.  In 2008 it was a close race between John McCain and Barack Obama. Any criticisms laid against this current administration should be in context of the alternative. Don‚Äôt like America‚Äôs involvement in Afghanistan? Imagine how it would be under the McCain administration. This administration came into being with a record level of debt, the worst recession in nearly a century, two wars, and rising unemployment. The Onion Headline for Obama‚Äôs inauguration was ‚ÄúBlack man hired for the worst job in America.‚Äù It took years to make such a huge mess and it will take years just to get back to where we were by the end of the last century. Rand Paul‚Äôs big fight is to preserve tax breaks for the oil industry while their profits climb 250% over just a few years. How brave of him.",‚Ñ¢
