t5_2qh13,lawstudent2,1343792545,"I disagree emphatically, and I'm a practicing intellectual property attorney.  What most artists *want*, as opposed to what © law provides, is *misappropriation law* which is also called *trademark.* To put this in layman's terms, the most important thing is that people do not reproduce your work *and claim it as their own.* That is the operative part: attribution. Giving credit where it is due. Letting people know **which artist created what, and not claiming the work of others as your own.** Copyright law is not in any, way, shape or form designed at protecting this. Instead, copyright law requires that for a fucking millisecond sample of someone else's song, for even *leaning* on an idea that is older than Shakespeare or Plato, for even referencing a commonly accepted fact, you need to get contracts signed by a half a dozen assholes. Copyright law is designed around protection of **permission.**  **This is preposterous.** Because **fuck** your permission. Speech, and ideas, are free. I should -- and do -- have every right to reproduce your ideas for the purpose of criticism, critique, and, yes, even commerce. Yet the absurdities of title 17, the DMCA, the technicalities of strike suits and strategic suits against public participation make copyright an effective vehicle for censorship, anticompetitive business practices and government enforced monopolies. I find this sickening.  Instead, what artists care about (and, if they don't, they are stupid) is **attribution.** Exempli gratia: Selling Nike Sneakers. More below.  Yes, you can use pictures of my work in articles, news stories, reproductions, derivations, satire, criticisms, reworkings, remixes, etc., just do me the favor of **crediting me. Do not claim that my creations are your own, even if you make money off of selling them.** This is what trademark law covers: you cannot reproduce, or 'pass off' the work of another as your own. If you sell Nike sneakers, you cannot rebrand them as moistanddampsneakers, even if you sell them at your store and make a profit. No, instead, you must keep the Nike logo on them. This exact same principle applies to art of any form, and the central ideas are protection against misappropriation, unfair competition and consumer protection. You all have google, look these concepts up. They are not difficult.  **This debate is called ""attribution v. permission culture.""** As someone who is related to artists, personally an erstwhile software developer, currently general counsel for a software company, a holder of degrees in mathematics, physics, and law, who is bar admitted and practicing, please let me assure you that copyright law takes a very close second place to patent law in the pantheon of hideous, absurd, backwards modern american intellectual property institutions. If you are an artist and think copyright protects your living, you are gravely and systematically misinformed, and you make me sad, good sir knight. **Any redditor who believes that permission culture is superior to attribution culture should delete their account immediately.** Think it through, people. Permission culture is a load of bullshit, and runs counter to every ideal this online community holds sacred, and, importantly, is based upon. Net neutrality, the first amendment, anonymous, remix culture -- these are all based upon the idea of attribution culture, as opposed to permission culture. If you truly believe that permission culture is the way to go, please, leave this site and enjoy living in the 17th century. Also, I hate you.  Art, like any other business, is about connecting with humans and selling them things they are willing to pay for at a fair price. If you think that copyright law is required to make this equation balance, you sincerely need a re-education in economics and psychology. Because it simply isn't true. This is the central part of that article, btw: copyright law always has, and always will be, about enforcing arbitrary government sponsored, privately owned monopoly over *ideas themselves.* If this concept does not sicken you, my god, get the fuck off my planet. /rant  **tl;dr I'm an intellectual property attorney and, no, copyright law, even in theory, is an unsalvageable mess that hurts innovation. Misappropriation / trademark law is all that is necessary to protect art / artists, and if you believe otherwise, you are pretty sincerely mistaken.**",©
t5_2tr68,atouk_zug,1343793208,"Putting everything else aside, ""OpenSDRDharp"" has no GPL protections at all.  A GPL must have a full legal name (aliases and pseudomyms are not allowed), and contact information in it.  The current version on the project page (OpenSDRSharp_v_0_0_1_Full), contains nothing other than a mirror image of an SDR# release, and a few added files.  One of these is a blank boilerplate GPL v3 (June 2007).  A blank GPL is not a placeholder.  It is as about as nonbinding a document you can get.  Only an empty file can be less binding, but linux users will even argue that it is still possible to see who created it.  The only copyrights that appear anywhere within the are;  Copyright © Youssef TOUIL 2012 (4 files.  You missed a few)  Copyright (C) 2012  OpenSDRSharp (49 files)  Copyright © GPL v2 (6 files)   The first is the proper and original copyright that was contained in the files as copied from the SDR# depository.  The 2nd is contained in most of the files where it REPLACED the proper copyright above it.  It is meaningless because OpenSDRSharp is not a proper entity in person or other registered entity.  The 3rd is contained in some of the files in place of the proper Youssef copyright, and is also meaninglesss.  The 2nd two examples are a direct and intentional subversion and defacement of the proper Youssef copyright.  Now to the empty GPL.  An incomplete GPL is a worthless document.  ALL of the required fields must be filled out to make it valid.  They even make it easy for you by showing you where to insert the proper information, such as "" Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;"".  But there's a problem with that.  You refuse to tell people your true name and would rather hide behind a nickname.  Also it states ""Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.""  Well that's just not going to happen either.  Real name + real contact info = people findng out who I am!  And there's further trouble.  These two lines;     b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or     author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal     Notices displayed by works containing it; or      c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or     requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in     reasonable ways as different from the original version; or   Section b requires preservation of author attributions.  But you just went and changed all of them in the source code!  And section c warns about misrepresenting the origin of the material.  Oopsies, changing them darn copyrights violated that little clause too.  Now in another folder we have an even different version of the GPL  Version 2 (June 1992).  And gosh darnit, that one's blank boilerplate, too.  Some days it's tough to get anything right, isn't it.",©

t5_2qh1e,Hovdizzle,1343795735,"This is something that happened to me about a month ago, but I'm lazy so instead of retyping everything, I'm just going to copy/paste EVERYTHING (conversations that are off topic included) I wrote about the situation on my FB page...  Andrew (me): Dear drunk people of Idaho Falls or those driving a car with an Arizona licence plate: Don't drink and drive. That way I, shirtless guy, and the Affliction wearing bro I was hanging out with who's name I don't know wont have to chase you down and restrain you when you try to flee the scene. Those air bags saved your life and I'm certain that canal looked like a good place for you to end it.  You're welcome.   Sincerely,   Me.  Andrew: Also, this Quesdilla from Bertos is massive. I dont understand how the expect me to eat it without a fork.   Amber: they dont   Amber: thats part of the joke   Andrew: It's not very funny then. D:   Emily: WTF?   Keri: I think another one of my friends was referring to the same guy in one of his posts. O.o Wait, did this guy crash into a canal or a Taco Bell? None of the above?   Andrew: None of the above. He ran into a truck that was parked on the street, hitting it hard enough to knock it into this persons driveway, smashing in to a SUV that was parked there. Then he skidded down the street past my buddy Sam's place before the car wouldn't move any more. This all happened while we were having a fire in Sams back yard.  By the time we all made it to the car, which was REALLY messed up, the guy whose truck got hit was already there and was on the phone with 911. The guy driving the car was fine, other than the fact that he was wasted. Everybody tells him to go sit down so he stumbles over to the sidewalk slowly, but doesn't sit down. Instead he makes his way across the street up the bank of a canal and keeps walking, then starts running when everyone tells him to stop. So Shirtless guy who I am assuming was a friend/relative of the guy whose truck got creamed, Affliction bro who was part of the party I was hanging out with and myself start chasing after the dude, who makes like he's going to jump in the canal, which if he did he would have probably drowned. Us three get the guy tackled and restrained just as a cop shows up and takes over.   Fun night all around. In total I think the guy damaged about four or five cars. Thankfully this happened around one in the morning and nobody but the turd driving the car got hurt.  http://i.imgur.com/gyB9y.jpg  Drunk dudes car that he drove half way down the street after smashing into the truck.  (That's basically the end of what happened to me, but my on the same night my friend got to experience a drunk driver smashing through the lobby of a Taco Bell, which he describes later on in the thread. Thankfully he was in the drive through at the time it happened)  Keri: I love your stories. :) Sounds intense! How do you end up catching all the excitement? Haha! Glad no one got hurt!   Cherryn: OMG! that is quite the story.... Tay saw the one that happened at Taco Bell... I will let him tell the story though. Way to go helping to save the day Andy!   Allen: Good catch Bro!   Andrew: Wait....someone crashed into Taco Bell?   Keri: Haha, yes. On 17th.   Andrew: When did this happen? MY TACOS!   Allen: Pshhhhhh betos is better   Amber: I'm willing to bet ""Affliction Bro"" was my buddy Christopher. He is fond of wearing Affliction, posted a photo of a wrecked vehicle with the caption ""tackled a drunk trying to flee"" and was at SAMs Palace of Poon (or something close to that) last night. Now, do I get a prize for identifying said ""bro""?  Andrew: Hahhahaah. I forgot that we tagged sams place as that now. Pretty sure that's him.   Andrew: Also Amber, you've been blessed with some stellar boobs. I think that right there is prize enough for anything. :3   Erica: Why are you still there? Seems like nothing but shenanigans. Already been to ID &amp; AZ &amp; back home to NJ &amp; now Philly. Read the signs man. The most unrest I had was in ID. Although, I still attest, any run in with police in IF was surprising positive. They maybe felt bad for me because im from NJ. Just run. Im going to gamble in Atlantic City &amp; hope luck pays out.   Andrew: Hahaha. If only it were that easy. Also, I miss your face Jersey.   Erica: Oh boy, you dont know how easy it is. Actually its awful. The Jersey nickname doesn't fly when you grew up here. Im missin your face also. I have to go hang out with the mafia now. Going to make it big in Atlantic City, ya heard??!!   Erica: I kid, but there's one way to roll...im irish, so im mildly accepted   Emily: OMG. This is one of the best Facebook posts I've seen in awhile.   Erica: Conglomorate of crazies.. Thats what this is.   Andrew: I feel so loved. Win me a car while you're out there gambling. ♥  Ellis: Srsly, Jerz- me too! I could use a new one ;)  Taylor: whoa Andy that is nuts! hahaha I was waiting in front of the Taco Bell drive through window when I heard the screeching of big tires, then BAM, CRASH, WHAM (kinda like an old batman episode apparently) and the Taco Bell workers were FREAKIN out, and I couldn't see what happened cause I was just behind the building at the drive through window. They had us all reverse and go out the neighboring driveway, cause a truck had plowed into Taco Bell's dining area, and was blocking the drive through exit, rofl. Retarded people are retarded. All I can say is, glad my order was not harmed in this accident, bahaha   Andrew: Hahahah. Wow that sounds freaking awesome/a little freaky. Did you get any pictures?   Andrew: Also Taylor your description reminds me of this...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mYHzIz57KM&amp;feature=related  ""Reality Hits You Hard, Bro"" - Original Interview   Andrew: And this!  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tcgw73CxEzs&amp;feature=fvwrel  Songify This: Reality Hits You Hard Bro (Extended Version)    And that's the end. Woo. But seriously, don't drink and drive. Ever. ",♥
t5_2qh13,lawstudent2,1343797192,"Out of curiosity, how many times have you sued someone for copyright infringement?   My guess is that the number is somewhere between precisely zero and precisely zero. A copyright suit takes about fifty to a hundred grand to reach conclusion. If you are making that kind of money as an artist, that you can just kick 50k to your lawyers, disregard the rest of my post, because you are already doing kickass. 100:1, however, you are not.  Curiosity question series #2: Do you create art because of the nuance of copyright law? Do you even know how one goes about copyrighting things? Do you even know how you would go about enforcing a copyright? My sincere guess, to all of these, is ""no fucking clue,"" except for the question ""why do you create things,"" to which the answer, I assume / hope is ""because **i fucking love creating things.**"" Notice how 17 usc 106 didn't get within a country mile of that? Probably not. Whatever.  &gt; like becoming a speaker/pundit. Frankly this is all pretty low brow, and not to do with my craft.   Again, boohoo. Seriously, fuck yourself. If you are such a fucking snob you cannot lower yourself to the idea of 'making money,' I not only have no sympathy for you, I have active antipathy for you and you are probably cruising off of my (gladly paid) tax dollars.   I am an 'artist' too. I write constantly and hope to one day sell my workproduct. But the idea that I should have to fuck myself because you are on a vision-quest to make money off of your craft makes me vomit into my loafers. It's called adulthood. Compromises are required. You sell to people who are willing to buy. You may not love your audience, but you embrace them otherwise. If you cannot deal with these facts, you will never be self sustaining as an artist.  Do us a favor: keep crafting, and keep selling it. Copyright law has nothing to do with it. The quality of your craft and the audience for your craft is 100% of the equation. If you do not understand this, it is probably because you are an artist and not an economist, lawyer, mathematician or psychologist. So keep making your art, and do everyone a favor: be fucking good at it, be kind to your audience, listen to them and treat them like human beings. This is the key to success. The six reserved rights of © doctrine are utterly irrelevant to this quest. And if you spend time worrying about ©, please, please realize this is time you should be spending creating new art, and you are just fucking yourself.",©

t5_2qvm1,islandprincessgirl,1343803821,"Island Princess' Secrets to Help You Feel Better   © Dmitri Zakovorotny | Dreamstime.com  Aloha and Talofa (hello), I would like to share some simple steps to beating depression and thinking positive.  These are motivational and inspirational actions that help me every time.   When I had my 'mini-princess' I suffered post-natal depression.  It was like going into a dark room, filled with pictures of all the sad and bitter parts of my life.  Here are a few things that helped me, and I hope they can help you too, princes and princesses.  Remember, the night is very dark, but there is always a sunrise.   1) Every day I forced myself to walk outside.  It was winter (I don't live on a tropical island currently) and the air was very cold, but full of fresh oxygen that made me feel better immediately, got my blood circulating well and helped me to sleep better.  My mini-princess went with me in a baby sling and it helped her sleep better too.  Cold air does not make you sick, if it is fresh and full of oxygen.  As long as you are dressed well and moving around in fresh air, even cold air can strengthen your immune system, but be careful if you are already suffering from sickness or a lung condition.  Tips for fresh-air walking: When walking in the fresh air take full advantage of it by breathing deeply and thinking about calming and relaxing things.  Even shallow breathing can cause a physical feeling of depression (I get this easily as I have lung problems, ever since having pneumonia as a child)               The freshest air is in a forest-covered mountain or next to an     un-polluted beach.  Beaches are so special because of the          ‘negative ions’ in the air.  We have too many positive ions        indoors because of all the electric appliances and re-breathing     the air.  To be truly refreshed, go out into nature.    © Dmitri Zakovorotny | Dreamstime.com  2) Sitting inside and keeping still are the worst things for your body and mind.  Even if you are not depressed, you could become depressed simply by doing this.  If you have no choice but to be inside, make sure there is some fresh air circulating, and get a fun (safe) exercise video to do in your lounge room.  In the islands, we love to dance, and even now I love dancing in my lounge room, much to the amusement of my prince.  My favourites are Zumba and belly dancing workouts.  3) TV, video games, and especially the news can be depressing in large doses.  We were created to be outside, princes and princesses, looking up at the stars, not stuck to a screen.  As soon as I cut down on these unnatural pursuits I felt better.  Gaming and media addictions are real and can cause depression and anxiety because they reduce your time in real life and reduce your confidence to associate with real people.  I was so addicted to reading fantasy, but once I realized I preferred the fantasy to my real life, I quit.  Media addictions can be harder to quit than heroin, so if you or your family and friends think you are addicted, you may need a professional counselor or psychologist.   4) Even though I love islands, we were not created to be an island.  Isolation or keeping to yourself is a sign of depression, and a cause of depression too.  I didn’t want to tell anyone that I was depressed, because I was afraid they would think of me as a bad mama.  But keeping all my feelings to myself meant I had no support network and I was emotionally isolated.  By all means don’t tell someone who will criticize you, but talk, talk, talk to people who have your best interests at heart.  You will be amazed at how communicating immediately helps you feel better.  Professional counselors and psychologists are a great option, so that the whole burden of your emotions does not fall only to your sister, or boyfriend, or spouse.  If your depression is long-term they will need a support network too!    © Jinyoung Lee | Dreamstime.com  5) Special note: There are certain people who will isolate you and cut off your other family and friends however they can.  Spouses, boyfriends, girlfriends, friends, parents and more can all isolate you.  They will make you feel it is bad to tell anyone else outside of the little island the controlling person has created with you.  I will discuss this more in a separate post, that isolation is a sign you are with a controlling, even bad, person.  Remember, no-one has a right to own your thoughts and feelings.  You have a right to share them with any trustworthy person.  When something is not right you feel it in your stomach, and that uneasiness in itself and reluctance to share is a sign that you must tell someone that something is not right.  If the first person doesn’t listen, you must tell someone else and preferably (again) speak to a professional.  ‘Mauruuru’ (thanks a lot in Tahitian) for reading ‘secrets to feeling better’.  All the best in your journey and please comment if you would like to ask questions or share your thoughts and tips on feeling better.  Xx ‘Island Princess’  P.S. If you are so depressed that you can’t get into action or get out of bed, I am begging you to call a professional or a depression hotline immediately.  These people are not afraid of your sad, bad, mad emotions and they are waiting to listen.  It is a dark night for you, but the sunrise will always come.   P.P.S.  Depression can cause fear of socialising.  It is a normal symptom, but it is important that you talk to a professional or join a support group as soon as possible.  ",©

Eventually, we stopped because a few guys did message us thinking we were serious and I ended up feeling massively guilty about tugging their pants down. Never revealed it, but changed our names back and a few of us became close enough friends with the server owner, that we have our own server now. We do troll as a collaborative effort when times call for it (asshole player, little kid, low level), but most of the time, they think we're dudes. ",♥

t5_2qh13,ThorLives,1343806406,"&gt; What most artists want, as opposed to what © law provides, is misappropriation law which is also called trademark.  No, it's not.  I'm a software developer and I want to earn a living from my work.  I don't believe your ""attribution copyright"" solves that problem.  &gt; Letting people know which artist created what, and not claiming the work of others as your own. Copyright law is not in any, way, shape or form designed at protecting this.  Yes, it is.  It just covers a lot more than that.  &gt; Speech, and ideas, are free.  You mean that in the ""natural world"" speech and ideas are free.  In the natural world, life is also short, brutish and nasty.  We've spent a long time trying to get away from the evils of the natural world.  You also don't have to pay taxes in the ""natural world"".  I suppose you're also going to complain about having to pay taxes?  Additionally, we're not talking about ""ideas"" here, since copyright covers a specific body of work, not just an ""idea"" or even ""speech"" for that matter.  &gt; Instead, what artists care about (and, if they don't, they are stupid) is attribution.  Yeah, all of us who disagree are ""stupid"".  Nice pre-emptive ad hominem for anyone who's going to disagree with you.  By the way, you should seriously checkout Creative Commons because it sounds like you've never heard of it.  &gt; as someone who is related to artists, personally an erstwhile software developer, currently general counsel for a software company, a holder of degrees in mathematics, physics, and law, who is bar admitted and practicing  WTF is the reason for even writing this, except to make some weird claim that ""You're very smart, so you must be right""?  &gt; Any redditor who believes that permission culture is superior to attribution culture should delete their account immediately.  Use some words to make your point rather than preemptively attacking anyone who disagrees with you.  &gt; copyright law always has, and always will be, about enforcing arbitrary government sponsored, privately owned monopoly over ideas themselves.  You've only proven that you don't actually know much about copyright, because copyright **isn't about ideas**.  There are tons of ways to remix ideas in ways that don't violate copyright.  Assuming you actually are a lawyer, you should know this.  Here's one example - checkout ""StarFront: Collision"".  It's a game that's an obvious ripoff of Starcraft.  It's also **not** a copyright violation, hence proving that **COPYRIGHT ISN'T ABOUT IDEAS**.  http://techland.time.com/2011/02/07/gamefronts-starfront-collision-looks-eerily-like-starcraft/",©

I must say that learning on the older aircraft models is a much more rewarding experience. I fly a Cherokee in BC, Canada and a 182 in the US (long story about dual country license/training). Both aircraft teach you to fly visually, and the Cherokee is just great for stall and spin training. Are the cirruses rated for stalls and spins? Parachutes are great and all that, but in most accident reports with those planes I've read, they state that *overconfidence in the parachute* was a key factor in those crashes.  Also, would you feel confident flying a from digital to analog? Be honest with yourself here.   Just my two cents. If you're ever in BC or Utah in late august PM me, mate!

t5_21of,win2012,1343846327,"Gold medal gymnast Shawn Johnson is taking questions on the Today Show’s Facebook page. The West Des Moines native is a special correspondent for the long-running morning show on NBC, the exclusive U.S. broadcaster of theLondon 2012 Olympics.  Facebook fans are asking her everything from what it was like as a former competitor to watch the U.S. Women’s Gymnastics team win gold to what it was like to do a commercial with Matthew Perry. The commercial plugs his new sitcom, called ""Go On,"" in which he plays a sportscaster going to group therapy. He consoles her for being an Olympic loser, to which she says ""No, I won a gold medal."" His reply is, ""and three silvers ... loser, loser, loser."" Then he's giving her a hug telling her it's OK. “It was so much fun doing the commercial,” Johnson answered. “Matthew Perry was one of the nicest people I've ever met. I've love to go back to the show for a visit!”  Others commenting are obviously Iowans, proud of their Olympic champion who won a gold medal on the balance beam in the 2008 Beijing Olympics.  Here’s a sampling from the shout stream:  Ethan Furnish: How is it Shawn being an Olympic champion and getting to see these girls become champions?  Edward True: Iowans ♥ Shawn Johnson  Greg Pack: Hey Shawn,Do you miss the Olympics and do you still wish you were competing in this Olympics?  Heather Roberts: What was your favorite thing about USA Gymnastics last night?  Tracy Ramsey: Have fun kiddo, and tell Gabby that Des Moines has a heck of a 'welcome home' for her.  Trisha Anderson Rogers: What advise, as a former Olympian, do you have for the Fab Five as they wrap up and will be heading home?  Jessica Smith: You are truly an inspiration Shawn. My daughter loves watching the commerical with you and your mom doing the routine in a house! Congratulations on your successes and many wishes of luck for your future!  Steven Bailey: What happened to the Russians last night? They seemed defeated before they took the floor. Did they get some bad news before the meet?  Laci White: How does it feel to be on the spectator side of the Olympics? What do you miss most?? BTW: You make us fellow Iowans very proud. Thanks for representing us so well.",♥

t5_2cneq,Gamion,1343859889,"Arkansas police say Southaven man killed himself while in custody      By Yolanda Jones      Posted August 1, 2012 at midnight    Authorities in Jonesboro, Ark., are continuing their investigation into the death of a Southaven man whom they say fatally shot himself while sitting in the back of a patrol car.  The Jonesboro Sun newspaper reports that Chavis Chacobie Carter shot himself Saturday night. Carter, 21, had been picked up on a felony warrant from Mississippi.  The bench warrant was issued by DeSoto County Circuit Court for contempt of court when Carter violated the terms of his three-year probation, according to court records.  Carter, whose address according to court records is the 8800 block of Sweet Flag Loop in Southaven, was arrested and charged in 2010 for two counts of sale of a controlled substance, marijuana. He was indicted on the charges by a DeSoto County grand jury in January 2011.  According to DeSoto County Circuit Court records, Carter pleaded guilty to one count on Aug. 31, 2011.  He received a non-adjudicated sentence, which allows first-time nonviolent defendants to complete certain conditions to avoid having a conviction on their record. Carter was ordered to successfully complete three years of probation and pay $100 a month for $2,154.50 in court costs assessments. He also was ordered to report for drug tests and pay drug testing fees.  Jonesboro Police Chief Mike Yates says his department is conducting an internal investigation after the death.  A police report says Carter was in the back of a patrol car with his hands cuffed behind his back when officers discovered he'd been shot. He was taken to a hospital, where he later died.  © 2012 Memphis Commercial Appeal. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed. ",©

In fact, being a bitch could be advantageous in my conundrum, as I’d love to more decisive about which project I’ll propose!   :p   In terms of my background, I’m a former foster kid who moved to China for two years while I taught English, I then spent 8 months in Germany working as an nanny.  After 3 years, I returned to US and attended a community college for 2 years.  After graduating, I attended UC Berkeley where I double majored in anthropology and psychology.  Psychology was actually my first major and I was actually in the middle of writing my honors thesis on empathy and Social Dominance Orientation when I realized I’d actually accrued enough anthro credits to take on the additional degree.   After graduating, I worked in two non-profits until I saved up enough money for a trip to South America where I travelled, volunteered at two organizations for 2 months (I wish I’d focused more on this) and studied Spanish.  Since returning, I’ve been teaching an advanced ESL class.   Wow, life story.  Anyway, I can see myself working in the realm of android technology with a specific focus in Cognitive Psychology and virtual world social behaviors.  To do this, it would be amazing to work in both the U.S. and Japan, although I speak no Japanese!  In South America, I’m interested in going back to La Paz and studying how issues such as child autism are interpreted and addressed by local cultures.  In Peru, I’m fascinated by archaeological processes and how they impact traditional communities.  More generally, I am also interested in the development of non-profits and how an anthropological lens can be incorporated into such programs so that they’re more inclusive/reflective of indigenous interests and methodologies.    Again, I apologize for the novel, I’m notoriously long-winded.    Do you think it is possible for me to sort of design multiple projects and submit them to different professors and just make a wish that someone will want to snatch me up?  Any other advice you have would be greatly appreciated ☺  ",☺

t5_2t103,newbiecuck2,1343874167,"So after a while of me eating her out while taunting her about how dirty she was for enjoying sex so much with him and how awesome that was, the him not enjoying it thing came up so I grabbed her phone and asked her why we don’t just ask him. Of course she was moaning nooo at this point but she was too horny to do anything but have me keep eating her out while taunting her about the possibility. I typed in “hey, what are you up to?” (any texting is not verbatim since this was on her phone and not mine so I don’t have records) to keep it tame into her phone and kept taunting her that she’d like it if I pressed send wouldn’t she, and eventually she relented and I pressed send. He didn’t answer for a while which was disappointing at first but he said something like “hey glad to hear from you stranger”. After that I texted back “I wish you were still here” and he wrote back, “I know I keep wishing we could have just hung out forever”. After I showed her that text she got so much hornier (not exactly sure why it was this point that got her into super horny mode but it was) which was so fucking hot, she was moaning “oh god” and “holy shit” while I just kept eating her out which was amazing (I made sure not to let her cum which was driving her crazy). I texted back “me too I had a lot of fun ☺” and then he texted “Fun doesn’t even begin to describe it. Ally, I didn’t even know what amazing sex was until last night”. After that she didn’t even resist at all when I showed her I was texting back “I feel the exact same way ☺”. And he texted back “You have no idea how glad I am you think so”.",☺
t5_2t103,newbiecuck2,1343874198,"After that I asked her while eating her out, you want me to tell him your parents actually aren’t coming back until Monday don’t you? And she said noooo but I could tell she really wanted to since she sounded so freaking horny while saying it. So I said, I know you’re a slutty enough girl that you want him to sleep over again don’t you (which I knew would work since it worked every time when I was convincing her to imagine I was him in the early days of us pretending I was him and her being reluctant about even that). And she said (after a few more nooo’s) “Oh my god yesss, I’m so sorry I’m such a bad girl”. I almost came right there but managed not to and just texted “Hey it turns out my parents and brother extended their trip, want to sleep over again?” And he texted “Of course I do. I’ll be there in 15, is that okay?” and I texted “Yes ☺” and showed her. After that she kept saying oh my god I can’t believe we’re doing this again, is this really a good idea? Which to be honest was more apprehensive than I was expecting her to be but we both knew it was going to happen again and I had to hurry to grab my stuff and hurry down the street in the opposite direction he was going to drive from. In retrospect I wish I had said give me an hour or something to give us more time to talk about it but in the heat of the moment I didn’t think of that. Still my heart is pounding just thinking about what they are probably doing right now.",☺

t5_2rgoq,lunk,1343916502,"I don't need to continue arguing - we clearly disagree on the foundation of this argument.  I think C25k Reddit is about a program, and you think it's about simply achieving the goal of running 5k.  I don't see where that can be reconciled.   I would leave you with this pre-amble from the CoolRunning website, which attempts to define C25k :    **[The Couch-to-5K ® Running Plan](http://www.coolrunning.com/engine/2/2_3/181.shtml)** Our beginner's running schedule has helped thousands of new runners get off the couch and onto the roads, running 3 miles in just two months.  Our beginner's running schedule has helped thousands of new runners get started.   **By Josh Clark** Too many people have been turned off of running simply by trying to start off too fast. Their bodies rebel, and they wind up miserable, wondering why anyone would possibly want to do this to themselves.  You should ease into your running program gradually. In fact, the beginners' program we outline here is less of a running regimen than a walking and jogging program. The idea is to transform you from couch potato to runner, getting you running three miles (or 5K) on a regular basis in just two months.  It's easy to get impatient, and you may feel tempted to skip ahead in the program, but hold yourself back. Don't try to do more, even if you feel you can. If, on the other hand, you find the program too strenuous, just stretch it out. Don't feel pressured to continue faster than you're able. Repeat weeks if needed and move ahead only when you feel you're ready",®
t5_2r9tk,Hiskitten,1343916681,"i've thought that maybe the reason i haven't reacted yet is because i don't think it's really over. As angry and hurt as i am, i have always felt He is my soul mate, it wasn't just sex, it wasn't just D/s, it was a friendship that transcended any other relationship i'd ever had. It began as a friendship, we were both with others when we met online, but after losing touch for a couple of years, finding each other again and both being available, it exploded into such a strong, dynamic *relationship*. And i know most of the other relationships He'd had before me were a D/s nature...  So maybe He's just needy physically - and found someone to fulfill that. But i also don't think it's over.  However, i can't talk with Him...i'm taking His lead right now. He called me Tuesday afternoon, told me what He had to, talked with me till work issues intervened, said He'd get in touch later on, and i haven't even gotten a text. That's what hurts and that's why i feel so pathetic for wanting Him back, because it was a dump-and-run, and He KNOWS how completely committed i'd been to Him.   But if He gets in touch, i'll see if the discussion goes that way. This is all so new for me, being without Him after 7 straight years of belonging to Him and obeying Him.  (But between you and me and everyone else...if He ends up unhappy...i will get more than a little satisfaction...is that bad? *s*)  Thank you for your thoughts. ☺",☺

t5_2qstm,coopdude,1343921032,"[https://creditcards.chase.com/freedom/FAQ.aspx](https://creditcards.chase.com/freedom/FAQ.aspx)  &gt;Merchants who accept Visa/MasterCard credit cards are assigned a merchant code based on the kinds of products and services they sell. Chase groups similar merchant codes into categories for purposes of making rewards offers to you. Chase makes every effort to include all relevant merchant codes in its listed categories. **However, even though a merchant or the items that it sells may appear to fit within a listed category, the merchant may not have a merchant code that falls within that category. Therefore, purchases with that merchant will not qualify for the stated rewards offer on category purchases**.  If you log into chase.com you should be able to see the pending transaction (and many issuers let you see the merchant code too so you can see how it is categorized; for example, [on one of my credit card sites (not Chase)](http://i.imgur.com/KCSbJ.jpg).  If it somehow passes as gas instead of some advertising services code (what Google has *traditionally used*) I'd be pleasantly surprised. However, using the merchant category code is standard for cashback - the fact that Google is warning you may not get it seems to point towards them not passing it along.  Every issuer I've had has had merchant code as the way to determine category cashback. If you confirm any exceptions, I'd be surprised - and happy to edit my post to reflect it accordingly.   [From Discover](https://www.discover.com/credit-cards/cashback-bonus/cashback-calendar-it.html):  &gt;Sign up to earn 5% Cashback Bonus for gas (at stand alone gas stations), movies and admission to theme parks from 7/1/12 (or the date on which you sign up, whichever is later) through 9/30/12, subject to a cap of $1,500 in purchases. Movie ticket and movie rental purchases are those made at merchants classified as movie theaters, video rental stores, online movie ticket and movie rental services. **If a purchase is coded for a category other than those listed above, it will not qualify.** These purchases must post to your account by 9/30/12. Purchases made at warehouse clubs, wholesale distributors, or discount stores are not eligible. Rewards are added to your Cashback Bonus account at the end of your billing period. See Cashback Bonus Program Terms and Conditions for further details.  [Amex Blue Cash](https://web.aexp-static.com/us/content/pdf/cardmember-agreements/blue-cash/BlueCashAECB.pdf)  &gt;**You will NOT receive reward dollars for everyday purchases if a merchant does not submit the purchase using the correct industry or merchant code**. A merchant with more than one location may submit purchases using different codes. This means that purchases at some locations would receive a higher reward, while purchases at other locations of the same merchant would receive a lower or no reward.  [Penfed Rewards Visa (5% at any US gas station paid at pump)](https://www.penfed.org/Platinum-Cash-Rewards/)  &gt;**Visa® USA determines which transactions are classified as gas purchases paid at the pump and supermarket purchases based on Merchant Category Codes**  [Citi](https://www.accountonline.com/ACQ/DisplayPage?docId=CompleteDetailsPop&amp;sc=46EZGW71901Z000000W&amp;app=UNSOL&amp;siteId=CB&amp;langId=EN&amp;BUS_TYP_CD=CONSUMER&amp;DOWNSELL_LEVEL=2&amp;BALCON_SC=&amp;B=V&amp;DOWNSELL_BRANDS=V,VV&amp;DOWNSELL_BRANDS=V,V,&amp;DownsellSourceCode1=46EZHW51901Z000000W&amp;B1=V&amp;DownsellSourceCode2=46EZIWL1901Z000000W&amp;B2=V&amp;t=t&amp;d=&amp;uc=BDX&amp;AMEX_PID_AF_CODE=&amp;AAPID) (**Citi cards that were eligible for this should be stored on device** and thus the proxied mastercard wouldn't be used. Thus, the Forward **should** get proper cashback. **The only reason I offer this excerpt is to support that the MCC is used to determine cashback rates**.)  &gt;**We do not determine whether merchants appropriately identify all transactions you make on your Card Account, but we do reserve the right to determine which purchases qualify for ThankYou Points.**  Point is, the MCC is the standard code used. If Google has somehow gotten the networks to agree to let them pass on the code - great. But their own articles and wallet purchases made online (which also show up as GOOGLE * MERCHANT NAME) seem to speak against that.",®

Vinyl siding (which I know a lot more about, I've never done hardi siding) has drain holes in the bottom to let and water escape, but your vertical joints need to be overlapped properly. I would recommend the same for your siding. Caulk the vertical joints, don't worry about any gaps horizontally, underneath each course.  If you want to be sure, email them! info@JamesHardie.com",®

t5_2rddy,beepbeepsean,1343976866,"Just read the [manual](http://www.native-instruments.com/#/en/products/dj/traktor-scratch-a10/?page=3925), it's all there.  E.g. &gt;**Delay T3** &gt; &gt;Classical tempo-synced Delay with a Freeze button. The Rate of the Delay is directly controlled by TRAKTOR’s Master Clock to ensure that the Delay syncs to the beat also during tempo changes. &gt; &gt;Single Mode &gt;▪	FILTER: Internal high pass filter and low pass filter (similar to a band pass filter). The fil- ter is open when the knob is in center position. It progressively cuts out low frequencies when turned to the right and cuts out high frequencies when turned to the left. &gt; &gt;▪	FEEDB (Feedback): Controls the strength of the delays feedback, making the effect stron- ger and more colorful: &gt;◦ Min: low feedback &gt;◦ Max: strong feedback &gt; &gt;▪	RATE: Controls the Delay time. Compared to prior TRAKTOR versions, the orientation of the knob has changed to: Min: long delay times, Max: short delay times. The 7 available values are expressed in fractions of bars, and are equally distributed over the range of the knob. The knobs position is displayed in bold letters:  &gt;The Effects in Detail &gt;◦ Min ⇨ Max: 4/4, 3/8, 1/4, 3/16, 1/8, 1/16, 1/32. &gt;▪	FRZ (Freeze): Freezes the Delay by closing the input while playing the delay with the set Feedback. The filer remains active in the feedback loop. For endless freezes, the FILTER knob has to be therefore turned to the middle position. &gt;▪	FR.R (Free Run): When pressed, delay times are not quantized and can be changed con- tinuously. Changing delay times while the Delay is active may result in sudden skips in pitch and rhythm. &gt; &gt;Group Mode (1-Knob Control) &gt;The knob works like the RATE knob in Single mode at a medium Feedback value.",▪

t5_2s7k2,ThunderCatsH0,1343986727,"Salam and peace to everyone,  Couldn’t hold myself back after reading your post, being a redditor for about 2 weeks figured I should join the fun.  This is my first post and hopefully I can shed some light for you.  FYI – I too was an atheist for some part of my life, I also looked into other religions and made myself believe I was a Christian to see if any miracle would happen or some divine vision would come through perhaps Jesus himself but nothing happened at all.  I spent countless days, weeks, months and years figuring out what I was looking for.  (does that even make sense ? lol)  It’s natural for us to question and ask things, especially with the inner self and be true to those thoughts with rational reasons behind every logic.    I’ve read countless books, including the gospels, bibles, torah, quran, vedas, ramayan, etc…  and I read in depth not skimming through per say.    To begin I believe being an atheist is very important, in Islam that is.  It is part of the sha ha dah where one can become a muslim.  Just a sentence without baptizing or doing anything fancy of that sort.  The saying is La ilaha illAllah which means “There is NO GOD” “BUT GOD”.    Firstly I would like to congratulate everyone on this board in saying the 75% of the complete sentence to become a muslim.  Let’s focus on your questions.  I will not answer anything I do not have knowledge of as it’s strictly forbidden in Islam.  1.	A true GOD did give everyone equal rights in which only they have complete control of to a certain extent.  Free will is also agreed upon in Islam where everyone has their own will to do as they please but God (Allah) knows everything.  Some might argue and say if God (Allah) knows everything we will be doing how is it fair on us as human beings?  Well I can give a clear cut example of this.  Imagine a teacher has a class who divides it into 3 and predicts that secion 1 will get all A’s, setion 2 will get all C’s and last but not least section 3 will get all F’s.  The students have spent only a few weeks/months at most with this teacher who has gotten to recognize their habits and performance at test levels making it that much easier for the teacher to predict the outcome.  The teacher doesn’t just FAIL section C in the very first few weeks even though the teacher knows that they are headed towards the wrong direction.  The teacher puts through till the very end leaving it all up to the student to decide what he/she needs to do to straighten up.   Bumping into characters of many different races or religions who may appeal you is very common.  I have bumped into a jew who wouldn’t even look at another woman and to my surprise he said it keeps me from committing sin.  I asked, “How so?!” He replied saying, “We are men, you know.”  I once came across a hindu who after getting into a car accident with a friend of mine gave him a ride home even though it was my friends fault and offered him advice on always being kind to others.  The list goes on but kindness and religion go hand in hand.  Islam is not just a religion but a a way of LIFE. 2.	I agree, that is why I only rely on the Quran not the hadith. 3.	Till this day I have yet to come across a book with phrases man just can’t think of.  Why is it hard to believe that the Quran is not the same that was revealed to him which he revealed to his companions.  Think about this for a second, how many songs do you remember that you can sing to?  1400 years ago with no television or radios this was very common.  It still amazes me how our Presidents of the USA were able and capable of writing the way they did.  Even the messages on the currency which has phrases that make sense even now in this modern world.  Men were extremely wise with words and poetic back in the days.  Quran is a book that contains words only sent by God (Allah) to his angel who then came to his messenger like he did to the others and recited it.  The very first word revealed to Muhammad by the angel was “Iqra” which means “READ!”  “How can I read” said Muhammad. Angel responded again saying “READ”.  I believe the word READ is very important in this life.  Without reading we will go astray and not be able to do anything in this world to the point where we are now. You need to focus 100% on Muhammad not the caliphs or companions.  They come later in the game and are no where near as important as the prophets have been.  It would be unfair for God (Allah) to send us books and expect mankind to follow it without having an example.  It would be like taking the SAT’s without going through school with your teachers and having hands on experience.  The proof is all around us even now. Go talk to any muslim, he/she will know of many who have memorized the entire Quran.  All 114 chapters.  The miracle of the Quran is that if all holy books in the world were thrown in the ocean within a matter of hours the Quran can be reproduced because millions remember it in the ORIGINAL authentic manner it was revealed.  Even the dot of a period will be where it belongs.  If people hundreds of years later can memorize it with WAY more to memorize now days then anything else then back then it was a piece of cake.   4.	The Prophet married many woman but most were for political gains and reasons.  I’ve read many books about this issue but you have to keep in mind.  On Earth the most books written AGAINST any human is Muhammad.  It’s like going to the eastern side of the world (China.Russia, Arab countries) and reading how bad of a president bush was.  Unfortunately many people think of Muhammad as a pedophile without truly reading about him from the muslim side of view.   5.	Agreed.  He taught people to love and live.  At his time a church can be built as long as it wasn’t higher then the mosque.  Also they were required to pay taxes which was completely fair.  It’s only after his death where the fanatics took over. 6.	God (Allah) is not in on anything.  He knows everything we don’t know or can ever understand.  Obviously for Satan to disobey the angel and go against Gods (Allah’s) will was something he already knew and had planned for.  Anything we do is for a purpose, without it there is no purpose. 7.	In the Quran we are his creations.  It’s like the President of a company.  Imagine yourself being the owner of Google/Ebay/Facebook.  You are the SHIT. You are the real deal. You are the one.  You don’t do everything yourself, you have regional managers, district managers, area managers, store managers, etc. etc..   God (Allah) has gifted us by giving us the opportunity to s\erve him… afterwards you get rewarded ☺   8.	In Islam the biggest sin you can commit is put or associate anything with or next to God (Allah).  In the Quran it says our knowledge in this world as to what lies in the heavens is as if you dipped your finger in the ocean. Earth can fit a million times in our Sun.  There is a star called (arakanadin) ←def spelled wrong but its 5 million times bigger then our star Then comes beetle juice which is 300 times larger then that star... then comes the VY star, a BILLION times bigger then our sun.  This just stuff they have found so far… way more out there we can’t even see.  This gives you an idea of how Great your BIG your lord is.  We can’t even compare it to a dot in the ocean let alone the universe.  We as human beings can’t comprehend or have the capabilities of understanding how he is or what he looks like.  Moses if you recall requested to see him, he passed out from the brightness alone.  As a gift God (Allah) will let his creatures see him in paradise. Based on what the Quran says he is ONE and is alone.  Just like you can’t question your president of a company you can’t question that either.  9.	Muhammad is how God (Allah) want us to be like.  Humble, giving, smiling, kind, etc..  He set forth an example for mankind to follow.  He taught not to sleep without knowing your neighbours next door are sleeping with full stomach.  About 2 years ago our neighbours lost their house in a fire, not only did we shelther them but provided them food and living for 4 months.  They were Christians and were welcome to practice their faith away from ours. It was his teachings that let us do that other wise we wouldn’t have.  It is the month of Ramadan, I am giving charity (big chunk of it) to the poor.  I have many businesses in the wireless retail side of which I have to give portions of to the needy including my properties and and gold/silver sitting anywhere including money sitting in bank that hasn’t been touched to the needy.  If every muslim gave charity like they are suppose to there will be no hungry families going to bed at night.  The list goes on… how is this bad or evil?   10.	The Quran describes the birth of Jesus better then any book I’ve read.  The difference is it says it was the “WORD” of God (Allah) that impregnated Mary not the holy ghost or a part of God.  He said, “BE” and there he was.  ",☺

t5_2qh1i,waubers,1344031043,"I was 17 and a month away from graduating from High School and on a random Friday night I had planned to have some friends over for a bon fire.  This was a pretty typical thing on weekend evenings.  On this particular Friday evening, my mother had made lasagna (SCORE!) for dinner, but it was my job to bake it when I got home since I was usually home by 3:00pm. Mom usually didn't get home until after 6:00 as she had a pretty long commute.    My Dad had finished working that day, and met some of his friends at a local tavern (bar to you non-Wisconsinites).  He called my mom at work and asked her to meet him and pick him up, as he had had a few. Mom called me and told me that she'd be home a little late because she was getting Dad.  So, I bake the lasagna, and when it's done have a piece, loosely cover it with foil and throw it back in the oven, and turn the oven down to 175F to keep it warm.  Figure this was about 6:00pm, so I assumed my parents would be home within a half hour.  About this time my friends start arriving for the bon fire.  I get distracted getting the fire going and the chairs set up and beverages in the coolers and what not, typical stuff.  I didn't realize it, but it was coming up on 7:30 before it dawned on my that my parents weren't home yet.  I head in the house, and turn off the oven, figuring they decided to stay out a bit, which usually results in them eating out.  11:00pm and I've now got probably 20 people hanging out, pretty good mix of guys and girls, chatting, roasting marshmallows, playing Sheepshead, being stupid, generally having a good time.  11:15pm and I see my Mom's car pull in the driveway. Next thing I hear the door of the car slam and I can tell Mom is pissed off.  Then I hear some yelling come from my Dad.  Not good.  I figured they were having another drunkfight©    The last years of my being in high school were marked with a massive increase in my parents drinking.  During that time I pretty much took care of my brother and just tried to stay under the radar of my Father.  I understand what happened very well now, but at the time I just kind of hated my Dad, at least when he was drinking, and cared more about shielding my brother from their shit than anything else.  Oh, and Magic: The Gathering, I cared about that a lot too...and seeing boobs.  What happened next wasn't pretty.  After Dad went inside yelling after Mom, I headed for the back door to our house to try to calm things down (a pretty typical thing I had to do).  I was greeted to my Father swearing at my Mom and calling her lazy and stupid and other unpleasant things.  My Mom was trying to ignore him and not embarass the family by having a huge argument with a yard full of people to hear it.  Before I said anything, she asked me where the lasagna was, I told her in the oven.    **Dad: ""What?  You left it in the fucking oven?  Why the fuck did you do that?  Are you stupid?  You fucking disgust me, you fucking lazy spoiled brat.  You're so fucking smart, why the fuck do you even need to live here?  Get you shit and get out, I don't want to see your face here ever again.  GET THE FUCK OUT!  I MEAN IT, YOU AREN'T SLEEPING HERE TONIGHT!""**  **At this point he grabbed my backpack (which had a laptop in it, that I bought with my own money...this was in 2000 so it was like $3k to replace) and thew all my stuff out the back door, while continuing to verbally berate me and my Mom.**  I started laughing, from the absurdity of his behavior, which just pissed him off even more.  I said, ""Fuck this"" and headed out the back door, checked my labtop for damage (it was okay) and grabbed my backpack.  I headed toward the fire and was intercepted by a couple of my closest friends asking what was going on.  I just told them my Dad was being an asshole and asked if I could crash by one of them, which they agreed to.  So, in 15 or so seconds, I went from being a non-speaking person in an argument to the biggest disappointment in my fathers existence and being kicked out of the house, near as I can tell, for him thinking I dried out the lasagna by leaving it in the oven.  Later that night, after my dad passed out, my Mother found me by the fire and told me I didn't have to stay somewhere else and apologized for him being the way he was.  I just told her that ""It's not your fault he's an asshole when he's drunk, and I wish you would just leave him""  She started tearing up and wend back to the house.  The following morning he had no recollection of what he said or did (or he just didn't want to have one).  Oddly, that pissed me off more than anything else.  I went to work and just downloaded a bunch of shit on Napster over my company's T1.  The following two weeks I finished up planning my college selection and housing.  I finally spoke to him when I told him I was going to be leaving for college in August and living on campus.  **tl;dr: Father kicked me out of the house because he was drunk and thought I overcooked the lasagna.**",©

t5_2qm6c,liloloaaloha,1344051667,"A few months ago, I had a dream about a very specific crochet pattern.  Two strands of [Lion Brand Homespun yarn](http://www.lionbrand.com/yarns/homespun.htm) held together, big ol' fatty hook (in this case N15 10mm size) and just double crochets, back and forth.  In my dream, it felt like one of the luxury blankets that sell for like $500, and when I finished the throw, it kinda did, at only a fraction of the price -- you can find the yarn at Wal-Mart for like $4.75 a skein.   Hope you guys enjoy it!  Here's the pattern, if anyone is interested:  10-12 skeins Lion Brand Homespun yarn - I used the color Regency N15 10mm hook   Chain 153 loosely, holding two strands together.  DC in 4th ch from hook, cont to dc across to last ch.  Ch 3. Turn.  Skipping first dc of last row, dc across to last dc, ending with dc on top of the ch3 turn.  Cont until you reach the size throw you want, or until you have only 2 skeins left.    Border:  At the end of last row, start working down the edge of throw, sc evenly until you reach the end.  Work 3 sc in corner to turn, cont to sc along bottom edge.  Cont with same pattern - sc evenly along the edges, with 3 sc in corners to turn - until beginning of border.  Join with sl st.  Finish off.   Hope everyone enjoys this!  Aloha ♥  ",♥

t5_2qq65,gedvondur,1344056451,"Full text of the announcement.  Got this in my email today. FYI Scotchit.  Hello U.S. Friends,  It gives me great pleasure to inform you that this year’s edition of Laphroaig® Cáirdeas Scotch Whisky has finally arrived! It’s aptly named “Origin,” because it contains whisky from our very first batch of Cáirdeas.  This whisky is now between 13 and 21 years old. We blended it (50:50) with another ‘special’ whisky we had been quietly maturing. This new spirit was then placed into small quarter casks, enjoying a very intense maturation for seven years. Both whiskies were fine expressions of Laphroaig® in their own right, but when blended together something exceptional emerged as befits this 18th anniversary.  It is 51.2%ABV strength and non-chill filtered, and as I’m sure you can imagine, tastes just wonderful. Here are the notes:  Nose: With a nose that constantly evolves and is full of flavour, Cáirdeas Origin begins with a quick hint of concentrated orange moving quickly into huge peat flavours, ashy, dusty with hazelnut. It becomes crisp and fresh with cold green apples, grapes and finishing with a fresh cut grassy flavour.  Palate: The flavours evolve slowly on the palate and with great body it begins with white pepper moving into an earthy peaty flavour, some slight salt then purple heather. Huge creamy apricots that last and last, and it ends with some charred damp wood.  Cáirdeas Origin is a very rare, special expression of Laphroaig® Scotch Whisky, with limited quantities in the U.S. So, without any further adieu, below are the markets where this exclusive expression should be available. Please check with your local retailers in these markets for dates of availability.

t5_2qh1i,SchoenBach,1344060749,"My story isn't particularly interesting, but whatever: we met when I was a junior in college, and he was a freshman (so that was 4 years ago). I really didn't know him that well and only met him through our mutual friend. We talked a few, but we really didn't start hanging out and getting close until spring term. The more I got to know him, the more I realized we have many things in common (i.e. we have similar tastes in music and the arts, political viewpoints, etc.), and to me, it was such a relief to finally find someone who I can empathize with and confide in.  And even though we had been best friends in college, we really did **NOT** spend much time together. Both of us had completely different groups of friends (he was with his frat friends, and I my international friends), but we ALWAYS decided to meet up super late at night at the park by the campus and smoked a pack of Djarums and had super in-depth discussions of things. In a way, the whole not-seeing-each-other-for-the-whole-day-until-3am really worked out for us (because we would never be sick of each other).  And so, I slowly developed feelings for him (**I caught the ghey**, btw...), and as we were walking around campus together, I said to him straight up: ""I really like you."" I was also probably inebriated when I spilled out my true feelings. He paused, and soon after laughed in disbelief, ""LOL, Jesus...... you're drunk."" Even though he rejected my drunken advancement (he's **straight**... durrr), we still remained close, and even closer than before.  It's not until near the end of my senior year where shit kind of hit the fan. He had trouble focusing in classes, things didn't work out with his degree, fucked up sleep schedule, and also rising tuition costs. And eventually he became depressed, and that's when I started to devote most of my time for him. We would always talk at our favorite fountain at 3am, vent our anger and frustration together, and huffed some more cloves.   But alas, things fell through, and he decided to drop out.  I was **FUCKING** devastated.  But I promised to myself that I would always keep in touch with him no matter what. He moved back to his hometown, and I just had to live with it (we still talked like a fiend on FB, but I was super sad that I lost my smoking buddy. I also quit smoking shortly after he left. Yay!). After I graduated in my super-senior year, I went on to do grad school in a nearby city. I talked with my friend on FB, and surprise, surprise: he was planning to move to the city with his friends!  ""OMG, I'll get to see my best friendskies again!"" I screamed in my mind.  I was absolutely overjoyed. When he moved in, we decided to meet up at a coffeehouse, and my he's changed. I had always known him as a fat chubby nerdy but adorable and mature kid, and now he's like a hot shot with haut-couture clothing, and ear piercings, etc. He told me that he's in a band and wants to see how far they will go. I got really excited for him, and I continued to support him.  Months later, they became, arguably, the best band in town (it's a big town, let's say, it's the capitol of a state). Got awesome reviews here and there, and their music is legit really, *really* good. Speaking as a music performance major, I can definitely attest to that.  Two nights ago, we chatted on FB, and he told me how everything, just, exploded in front of his eyes. And he told me about how everyone loves their music, etc. And naturally, I told him many times about how happy I am for him. After an hour of talking, he wrote me:  ""thanks for being the best friend in the world""  I then wrote, ""EEEEEEK! :3 CAN I PLZ QUOTE THIS? TEE HEE""  He ""LOL""'ed, then said ""i want to hug you.""  I think that might have been our **FIRST** open declaration of best-friendship in our **FOUR** years of camaraderie.   Before I went to bed, I updated my FB status: &gt;""thanks for being the best friend in the world"" - my best friend in the world :) ♥  tl;dr: **I FUCKING LOVE MY BEST FRIEND. FUCK YOU.**",♥

It was originally a way that effeminate men could be sold out of the slave trade for plantations, into the sex trade or sold as ""females"" to horny slave owners. The 5 pointed star was used as a marker to denote that they were for ""female use"" (the 5 points being the head, the arms and the legs) - a 6 pointed star was used if they were to be sold as men (the 6th point being the penis). Shortly after slavery ended, those with the ""badges"" got together and opened Brothels which specialised in transsexuals. They used the Star on the door or windows of the brothels to signify that it was a ""tranny"" house. The star became known as ""Espalhe a estrela aberta do sexo"".  &gt; In more recent times, it's become the marker of the tranny mafia group who kept the original name. Part gang, part prostitute union they pretty much control a lot of the travesti sex industry in Brazil and once your in, you have ""protection"" - for a fee of course, the tattoo is the prove that you are in the ""Union"". Wearing it without being accepted in the Union would have a punishment ranging from death, to full castration or acid thrown in the face (the last two disabling a TS from being a TS prositute).

The lower pH of synthetic detergents, such as Cetaphil®, minimizes skin irritation and dryness [150,151]. In a small randomized trial, patients with moderate acne (treated with a benzoyl peroxide/erythromycin combination gel alone or combined with adapalene) were instructed to wash their faces with either a synthetic detergent bar (Dove® Sensitive Skin Bar) or soap [152]. After four weeks, the patients washing with the synthetic detergent bar exhibited less skin peeling, dryness, and irritation than those using soap.  &gt; [150] Draelos ZD.

Going to the hospital I was very out of it. On the verge of passing out. I think I almost died that day.   But yeah it makes you different. Because of the trauma I live a very ethical life. Treating everyone as equal and helping people that need helped. It makes me sick the acts of violence people can commit. I've learned to harness hate in a productive way.

t5_2qh1i,Valdovinos,1344164749,"Bear with me as I write a novel:  I have been burning out for a while. More of a long ramp than a straight fall for me. During sophomore and junior year in high school I stopped caring, failed a class blah blah. Senior year didn't go too well either. I ended up finishing high school about 50th percentile of my graduating class with a 2.5ish. That summer I decided not to go to a university because I wasn't offered financial aid.   I enrolled in a community college one city over and thus didn't know anyone. I took the placement exam and scored high enough to enter the honor's program and have tuition and books paid for for two years. I didn't maintain the required GPA the first semester and was placed on academic probation. In the end the scholarship only paid for my first year before I lost it. My next three semesters I received Pell Grants and scholarships, grades were never too good and hovered around a 3.0. However, during my time at that college I flourished. I joined a student organization, which I became President of in my second year. I made new friends that I still have (quality friends at that). During my time at this college I held two jobs on campus, one of which I still have, the other involved guiding new students through an orientation and campus tour. I met so many people and was/am on a first name basis with dozens of professors and college administration, I was able to go on retreats and actually become part of a community (as cheesy as that sounds).  I graduated from community college a year ago and started going to this huge university where I feel like ""just a number"". A few of my professors have known me by name, but I've never felt the same passion for knowledge and community building as I did at that community college (where I still work). I am having a hard time keeping my grades up, but I want to change that. I have no doubt in my mind that if I were to seek a niche at this university I would find one, but now I'm more interested in just finishing the degree and getting on with this part of my life. In less than 3 weeks I'll be starting my senior year. If all all goes as planned and I work very hard I'll have a BS in Economics in 3 semesters.  I guess what I'm trying to say is never stop wanting more. Just because you veer off the path doesn't mean you can't get back on it. Setbacks won't happen just once, but overcoming them gives you the momentum to keep going. You also have to want to do better and above all, you have to be willing to put in the work.    **TL;DR New beginnings are great, find what you're passionate about and don't let setbacks discourage you. I ♥ Pell Grants and the cliches you've heard make more sense the older you get!!!**",♥

t5_2qm35,donkey_lz,1344186117,"Bine, o să încerc o explicaţie mai detaliată: sintagma ""un degenerat de poponar"" stă la baza unui comic de situaţie, amuzamentul fiind creeat prin contrastul între un prim post, care promovează toleranţa etnică, şi un al doilea post care foloseşte o formulare asociată cu intoleranţa faţă de minorităţile sexuale. Implicaţia este, desigur, aceea că unul dintre cele două posturi nu este reprezentativ pentru viziunea autorului, întrucât o viziune generală de toleranţă nu se poate manifesta simultan prin toleranţa etnică şi intoleranţa faţă de minorităţile sexuale.  Faptul că cel de-al doilea post vine ca răspuns la postul lui rockeh, post care (într-o manieră de asemenea umoristică) a înlocuit numele de Ion şi Janos cu numele Erzsi şi Saveta, sugerând că diferenţele cu ecouri xenofobe sunt oricum superficiale şi se estompează degrabă în faţa impulsurilor de reproducere, sugerează faptul că cel de-al doilea post al autorului este într-adevăr cel care nu este reprezentativ pentru viziunea sa. În acest fel, el creează un contrast între aparenţă (faptul că este intolerant faţă de minorităţile sexuale) şi esenţă (faptul că este de fapt o persoană tolerantă). Această figură de stil, prin care se enunţă un lucru din care de fapt se înţelege contrariul, este chiar ironia, termen definit de Dicţionarul Explicativ al Limbii Române chiar în acest fel:  &gt; IRONÍE s.f. 1. Cuvânt, frază conținând o ușoară batjocură, folosind semnificații opuse sensului lor obișnuit; zeflemea, persiflare. ◊ Ironia soartei = situație intervenită contrar tuturor așteptărilor, ca un joc neașteptat al întâmplării. 2. Categorie estetică și filozofică desemnând expresii sau imagini cu semnificații opuse sensului obișnuit, în scopul ridiculizării disimulate. ♦ **Figură de stil prin care se enunță ceva pentru a se înțelege contrariul**.

t5_2rz8w,MissJacki,1344186950,"Heyo loseit!  I've lurked a little, but mostly avoided the subreddit because I wasn't ready to face the music. I had lost a bit of weight last year in preparation for a trip to Israel, and when I came back I injured my foot and got right back into the habit of not doing anything, and gained the majority of it back. So, a year later, here I am.  A little about me -    * 26 years old * Female * 5'2 ~~eyes are blue~~ * 286.5 lbs * Goal Weight = 140lbs * Daily Calorie Burn Goal = 2,700 calories * Daily Calorie Deficit = 750 calories * Daily Steps Goal = 10,000 steps (Not sure if this is realistic) * 100% Sedentary... until today.  I talked to my doctor again to help get me back on track, and he said that in his experience, he has only seen one person lose as much weight as I had twice after falling off the wagon for so long. That put me into ""Oh yeah? Well *I'll show you!*"" mode (knowing him, that's probably what he was doing. The man knows me well). So, today, I finally went out and did something. I fixed up my old bodybugg and slapped it on yesterday to get an idea of where my baseline was. Now that I have it, I moved today. Now, it isn't a lot of moving... I burned a little over 300 calories, but it took me an hour and I was sweating and head a good heart rate going.  The eating is going... well-ish. That hasn't been too much of a problem in the past, it's more the fact that it just hurts so damn badly to move, and then I get exhausted afterwards. I also get nauseated quite often when I'm exercising (and afterward) so at times I struggle to get in even 900 calories. Part of the issue is that I just get so damn tired, it's hard to cook anything and nothing sounds good.   So, there's my story, for better or worse.

t5_2qh0n,gallais,1344207543,"I went for [a typing derivation](http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=WjWf9Fhh) (you may want to decrease the font's size if you have a small screen like I do) or a proof in intuitionistic [sequent calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequent_calculus) if you prefer. If you manage to find nice pictograms for the brain / beauty parts, I guess it could look good.  Quick explanation : At the beginning Γ is defined as a bunch of operators. Let's have a look at one of them : Y. It is a function that given a conjunction of some A and some B (written A × B) followed by some C will give you back a conjunction of A, B and C (not a really complicated function as you may guess).  Then we prove that when we give the O and then the U defined in Γ to the operator Y (thus spelling ""you"") what we will get back is the conjunction of heart, beauty and brain. i.e. YOU is all of this.   How to understand the proof tree?  * A sequent     Γ ⊢ A means that in the context Γ we know that A is true.  * A deduction rule lists hypothesis on top of the bar and the conclusion one can draw from them at the bottom. By combining different deduction rules we build the proof tree.  \         Γ ⊢ Hypothesis1    Γ ⊢ Hypothesis2     _____________________________________name_of_the_rule           Γ ⊢  Conclusion  Here are the rules used in the proof and some intuition for them.  * axiom: if my context Γ tells me that something is a fact then it surely is!  \       A is in Γ      __________axiom       Γ ⊢  A  * modus ponens: if we know that A implies B (written A→B) and that A then we know that B.  \       Γ ⊢ A → B    Γ ⊢ A     ____________________modus ponens           Γ ⊢  B  * ∀ elimination : ∀ is the universal quantification. Eliminating it amounts to specializing the formula for a chosen argument: if P(A) is true for all A then it surely is true for B, ♥ or whatever else you want.  \       Γ ⊢ ∀A. P(A)     ____________________∀ elimination           Γ ⊢  P(B)   NB: In my derivation tree it's a bit more involved because instead of just proving that we can get e.g. some B we keep tract of how it was built! If f is a function building B from A and x is some A then f applied to x (written f x) is some B (and this is proven using modus ponens). All written up this gives:        Γ ⊢ f : A → B    Γ ⊢ x : A     ____________________________modus ponens           Γ ⊢  f x : B  If there's a part you don't understand feel free to ask. If you end up actually using this for your card, I wouldn't mind seeing the result. ;)",♥

t5_2qzqs,mutantmagnet,1344230983,"The following is a truncated revision for the contract I'm thinking of.  Preamble As customers of Valve Inc. we understand Valve’s need to make a new contract revising the terms for legal options. After reviewing your contract, and consulting your customer service representatives on the finer details, we can’t accept the terms as written and offer an alternative contract for you to consider.  We present this contract, not to represent just ourselves; but those who have already accepted the agreement in poor faith and to address the concerns of future consumers of Valve related products and services.  There is a tacit understanding made between us and Valve that Valve provides a venue for software developers and customers to sell and buy goods respectively with a set of advantages and disadvantages that we agree makes selling and buying on Steam worthwhile. Barring customers for using licenses they purchased under previous contracts because they won’t accept a new one with Valve is unconscionable and decaying the value both the developer and customer place in Valve’s services and platform.  An equally troubling problem is that Valve seeks to revoke our ability to act as a group. The ability to act as a group is a very powerful corrective force that allows people to make better judgements in how to deal with legal matters. It also allows them to better manage the costs in time and money by delegating responsibilities and sharing the burdens of any matter, not just legal.  Valve has long considered itself a good partner for buyers and a patron of positive consumer values. To throwout one of the most important tools in making the lives of their customers more efficient runs counter to past behavior and you need to carefully reconsider how you made such a faulty error in judgement.  All the changes found in this counter-offer is written in caps. To quickly find the changes simple search for the word [change].  To contact us for further negotiation you can *THIS WILL BE FILLED IN ONCE WE HASH OUT CERTAIN DETAILS*  Steam® subscriber agreement   &lt;snipped for brevity&gt;  10. Term and termination A. Term. The term of this agreement (the ""term"") commences on the date you first indicate your acceptance of these terms, and will continue in effect until otherwise terminated in accordance with this agreement. B. Termination by you. You may cancel your account at any time. You may cease use of a subscription at any time or, if you choose, you may request that we terminate your access to a subscription. However, subscriptions are not transferable, and even if your access to a subscription for a particular game or application is terminated, the original activation key will not be able to be registered to any other account, even if the game or application was purchased in a retail store. Access to subscriptions purchased as a part of a pack or bundle cannot be terminated individually, termination of access to one game within the bundle will result in termination of access to all games purchased in the pack will be removed from the account. Your cancellation of an account, or your cessation of use of any subscription or request that access to a subscription be terminated, will not entitle you to any refund, including of any subscription fees. Valve reserves the right to collect fees, surcharges or costs incurred prior to the cancellation of your account or termination of your access to a particular subscription. In addition, you are responsible for any charges incurred to third-party vendors or content providers before your cancellation. **[change]UPON CANCELLING YOUR ACCOUNT YOU STILL RETAIN ACCESS TO SOFTWARE PURCHASED FROM VALVE FROM STEAM BUT AREN’T GIVEN ACCESS TO ANY OF VALVE RELATED SERVICES AND ADDITIONAL SOFTWARE OTHER THAN THE SERVICE NEEDED FOR AUTHENTICATION OF YOUR PREVIOUS PURCHASE. IF YOU DECLINE TO ACCEPT THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT THIS ISN’T CONSIDERED TO BE CANCELLATION. YOU WILL HAVE THE SAME LIMITATIONS AS A CANCELLED ACCOUNT UNTIL YOU AGREE TO THE NEW TERMS YOU HAVE MADE WITH VALVE. [/change]** C. Termination by valve. Valve may cancel your account or any particular subscription(s) at any time. In the event that your account or a particular subscription is terminated or cancelled by valve for a violation of this agreement or improper or illegal activity, no refund, including of any subscription fees, will be granted. D. Survival of terms. Sections 2(c), 2(e), 2(f), 3(a), 3(b), 3(d), 3(h), and 5 - 13 will survive any expiration or termination of this agreement. Unused funds in your steam wallet are not refundable upon expiration or termination.   &lt;snipped for brevity&gt;  12. Dispute resolution/binding arbitration/class action waiver. Most user concerns can be resolved by use of our steam support site athttps://support.steampowered.com/. If we are unable to resolve your concerns and a dispute remains between you and valve, this section explains how we agree to resolve it. You and valve agree to resolve all disputes and claims between us in individual binding arbitration. That includes, but is not limited to, any claims arising out of or relating to: (i) any aspect of the relationship between us; (ii) this agreement; or (iii) your use of steam, your account or the software. It applies regardless of whether such claims are based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, unfair competition, misrepresentation or any other legal theory. However, this section does not apply to the following types of claims or disputes, which you or valve may bring in any court with jurisdiction: (i) claims of infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights, including such claims seeking injunctive relief; and (ii) claims related to or arising from any alleged unauthorized use, piracy or theft. This section does not prevent you from bringing your dispute to the attention of any federal, state, or local government agencies that can, if the law allows, seek relief from us for you. An arbitration is a proceeding before a neutral arbitrator, instead of before a judge or jury. Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court, and provides more limited discovery. It follows different rules than court proceedings, and is subject to very limited review by courts. The arbitrator will issue a written decision and provide a statement of reasons if requested by either party. You understand that you and valve are giving up the right to sue in court and to have a trial before a judge or jury. You and valve agree to make reasonable, good faith efforts to informally resolve any dispute before initiating arbitration. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send the other a written notice that describes the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and sets forth the relief sought. If you and valve do not reach an agreement to resolve that claim or dispute within 30 days after the notice is received, you or valve may commence an arbitration. Written notice to valve must be sent via postal mail to: attn: arbitration notice, valve corporation, p.o. box 1688, bellevue, wa 98004. The federal arbitration act applies to this section. The arbitration will be governed by the commercial arbitration rules of the american arbitration association (“AAA”) and, where applicable, the aaa’s supplementary procedures for consumer related disputes, as modified by this agreement, both of which are available athttp://www.adr.org. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this agreement. The AAA will administer the arbitration. It may be conducted through the submission of documents, by phone, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location. If you seek $10,000 or less, valve agrees to reimburse your filing fee and your share of the arbitration costs, including your share of arbitrator compensation, at the conclusion of the proceeding, unless the arbitrator determines your claims are frivolous or costs are unreasonable as determined by the arbitrator. Valve agrees not to seek its attorneys' fees or costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines your claims are frivolous or costs are unreasonable as determined by the arbitrator. If you seek more than $10,000, the arbitration costs, including arbitrator compensation, will be split between you and valve according to the AAA commercial arbitration rules and the AAA’s supplementary procedures for consumer related disputes, if applicable. **[change]YOU AND VALVE AGREE NOT TO BRING OR PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION EVEN IF AAA’S PROCEDURES OR RULES WOULD OTHERWISE ALLOW ONE. YOU MAY BRING OR PARTICPATE IN COLLECTIVE ARBITRATION. THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL OR COLLECTIVE PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT OF THAT PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL OR COLLECTIVE CLAIM. [/change]**You and valve also agree not to seek to combine any action or arbitration with any other action or arbitration without the consent of all parties to this agreement and all other actions or arbitrations. **[change]IF THE AGREEMENT IN THIS SECTION NOT TO BRING OR PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION SHOULD BE FOUND ILLEGAL OR UNENFORCEABLE, YOU AND VALVE AGREE THAT IT SHALL NOT BE SEVERABLE, THAT THIS ENTIRE SECTION SHALL BE UNENFORCEABLE AND ANY CLAIM OR DISPUTE WOULD BE RESOLVED IN COURT OR IN COLLECTIVE ARBITRATION.[/change]** Notwithstanding this section, you have the right to litigate any dispute in small claims court, if all the requirements of the small claims court, including any limitations on jurisdiction and the amount at issue in the dispute, are satisfied. This section 12 shall apply to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. If the laws of your jurisdiction prohibit the application of some or all of the provisions of this section notwithstanding section 11 (applicable law/jurisdiction), such provisions will not apply to you. &lt;snipped for brevity&gt;",®

t5_2qhma,TheEternalNeophyte,1344238304," White Island volcano has erupted, prompting GNS Science to advise visitors to take extra care.  The island, located about 50 kilometres off the coast of Whakatane, is an active volcano and a popular tourist spot.  Its web camera captured the small eruption from Crater Lake, GNS Science volcanologist Michael Ronsenberg said.  ""These phenomena are not unknown for While Island, but this is the first substantial confirmation that small scale eruptions are now occurring on the island and confirms the risk to visitors has increased,"" he said.  ""Eruptions can occur at any time with little or no warning. We advise extra caution should be taken, if visiting the island.""  GNS has changed the volcano's code from ""experiencing signs of elevated unrest above known background levels"" to ""volcanic eruption is underway with no or minor ash emissions"".  The alert level has also changed from one to two due to ""minor eruptive activity"".  It follows a code change last week when scientists discovered water levels in Crater Lake rose by about 3m to 5m overnight and the number of tremors had increased.  There was a particularly stronger seismic episode recorded Sunday morning, ending in a volcanic earthquake at 4.54am that day.  Rosenberg said: ""[The earthquake] had a sound signal, which meant something happened on the surface. So we went back and looked at the camera images.""  ""Obviously being at night time, there was no visual observations and initially we weren't able to determine what that small event was.  ""But we've narrowed it down and recognise that there has been full hydrothermal eruption.""  Rosenberg said there had not been any further eruptions, and the number of tremors had decreased.  ""It's now at similar levels to before the weekend.""  GNS Science was ""paying close attention"" to the volcano as the last ""gentle eruption"" had been in early 2001.  White Island also experienced a ""moderate-sized explosion"" in July 2000, when fresh lava was pushed out.  ""In the past this kind of activity has increased to small eruptions that produce ash, and that ash could drift as far as the mainland,"" Rosenberg said.  ""We can't predict what the volcano is going to do and we are not making any forecasts, but yes, it's certainly possible that the activity could ramp up again.""  - © Fairfax NZ News",©

Neither, actually. The word 'LEGO', when used as a noun, should only refer to the company that makes the product. Otherwise 'LEGO' is supposed to be used as an adjective. Thus, when referring to the pieces, neither 'lego' nor 'legos' is correct... rather one should say: 'LEGO bricks' or 'LEGO pieces' or whatever (using LEGO as an adjective -- and one should really capitalize all of the letters, and put the little 'circle-R' symbol after it (®)).

This is not to say that I use the word correctly 100% of the time... but that's the answer to the question (it's always fun/painful to read the near-flame-wars that start at slashdot.org over this topic... and generally, both sides are wrong).",®

t5_2qh4r,bumblingmumbling,1344271589,"White Supremacist as many people are discovering is term of slander and smear by Jewish Zionist Supremacists.   I came to understand the Zionist conspiracies after 8 years of research into 9/11 prior to that I was not antisemitic. **The more one looks into the Zionist rabbit hole the deeper it gets.**   The SPLC is a Zionist operation with ties to most False Flag events in the USA.   **Hate and Slander for Profit** Dissecting the Southern Poverty Law Center Report A Special Report from Digger's Realm August 2009  This report was prepared by Dan Amato and edited by Ruth Miller of www.IllegalProtest.com  Digger's Realm is supported entirely by private donations. No government funds are involved. © Dan Amato. All rights reserved  Introduction BY DAN AMATO  In August, 2009 the Southern Poverty Law Center released a ""Special Report"" entitled ""The Second Wave: Return of the Militias"". In this completely fabricated conspiracy theory of a report, Mark Potok, Larry Keller and David Holthouse continue to point their fingers at legitimate American Citizens of this country - who have real concerns - and call them racists and hate-mongers.  In this ""Special Report"" of my own entitled ""Hate and Slander for Profit: Dissecting the Southern Poverty Law Center Report"" I intend to set the record straight on this piece of race-card playing, pile of lies that the SPLC continues to perpetuate in order to justify their existence.  If you have a second-grader handy, you could probably write a similar report as the SPLC has done and peddle it around as real journalism to all of the mainstream media outlets. They scarf this race dividing and hateful garbage up - and hey - they love a good conspiracy theory. They might even get some gullible, useful idiots to donate money to you thinking you're doing something good for this country and its people.  I urge all of you who are reading this to pass it on to your friends. The activities of the SPLC must be exposed for what they are. You can download a printable PDF of this full report here to hand out or spread around.

t5_2s4m9,ClashOfFeminizations,1344272540,"**How to argue like a white racist**  [ ]Anything but race – Racism is over. There must be some Logical Explanation that has nothing to do with race.  [ ]Blame-shifting – Blacks like to use the race card, crying racism and blaming whitey, but blacks are to blame for their own mess. Racism is so 1968.  [ ]ad hominem – question a commenter’s intelligence, character, age or motives.  [ ]Whites are individuals – so you cannot make general statements about whites. Besides, that would be racist.  [ ]“Blacks are racist too” - but they do not like to admit it. Find a case where a black person did something just as bad as what they are pointing out.  [ ]“You are the racist one” - turn the tables.  [ ]“I am offended” – how dare they call you a racist! You do not see a person’s colour – they could be purple for all you care!  **[✔]Arab trader argument – whites are not as evil as black people like to think. For example, it was not just white people who traded slaves: Arabs did it too! Few blacks know that, so make sure to point that out whenever you can.**  [ ]“But that happened to me too!” – whatever blacks complain about, try to find a case where a white person – you, a friend, someone in the news -  experienced the same thing.  [ ]Point out how “ghetto” and disagreeable black people are – because they are and it needs pointing out. No wonder no one gets along with them!  [ ]Talk down to them – they are imagining things, they do not know what they are talking about. How dare blacks tell us what we are like. What do they know? Are they white? [ ]straw man – argue against some stock position that is kind of like the post. That way you can copy your comments from another blog. Or from Ann Coulter.  [ ]Blacks need to be colour-blind – if they just stopped seeing race and talking about it so much then racism would go away!  [ ]Start quoting rape statistics – out of the blue, if necessary. Rates of imprisonment are good too.  [ ]The white inventor argument – whites invented everything so shut up already.  [ ]Demand proof – Make them prove it beyond a reasonable doubt with facts and figures. Find holes in whatever facts they present. Find counter-facts.  [ ]Make it about the past - and point out that your family never owned slaves. When are they going to stop living in the past?  [ ]Go back to Africa – if it is so bad here, then go back to Africa already!  [ ]Bootstrap – I made it on my own without help from anyone.  Blacks expect something for nothing!  [ ]Some of my best friends are black – so there is no way I am racist!  **[✔]Might makes right – all through history.**  [Source](http://abagond.wordpress.com/2009/10/05/how-to-argue-like-a-white-racist/)  ***  Too lazy to look through and check off all the other ones that apply, anyone want to?",✔

He typed everything as if he were saying it in a heavy southern drawl, and referred to himself as 'Cowlad' in the third person, and signed every comment as 'Sundown' (or some variation of).

Actually everyone did have the same experience ... it doesn't matter what you do (even more so with the ExCut since getting the minimal EMS score is impossible, without a lot of hard work). It's actually a great challenge to have different experience with ME3. You need a ridiculous amount of insight into the ""logic"" (hah) chain of actions to do more than extreme left or right. Playing on action mode (e.i. Directors Cut) is about the worst experience in ME3 next the star brats introduction. Is Tuchanka awesome ? Yes, but a majority of ME3 is a literal definition of [hyperbole](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbole) in bad story telling ... especially the first part of the [ME3](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M-jtGoYX_Q) (narrated by a former bioware gameplay lead). And don't forget the guy who gave us Tuchanka (Patrick Weeks) [slammed](http://www.gameranx.com/updates/id/5695/article/mass-effect-3-writer-allegedly-slams-controversial-ending/) the ending on PA's forums (which was pulled down so the guy didn't get fired).

t5_2s4m9,ClashOfFeminizations,1344353339,"###**How to argue like a white racist**  [ ]Anything but race – Racism is over. There must be some Logical Explanation that has nothing to do with race.  **[✔]Blame-shifting – Blacks like to use the race card, crying racism and blaming whitey, but blacks are to blame for their own mess. Racism is so 1968.**  [ ]ad hominem – question a commenter’s intelligence, character, age or motives.  [ ]Whites are individuals – so you cannot make general statements about whites. Besides, that would be racist.  **[✔]“Blacks are racist too” - but they do not like to admit it. Find a case where a black person did something just as bad as what they are pointing out.**  **[✔]“You are the racist one” - turn the tables.**  [ ]“I am offended” – how dare they call you a racist! You do not see a person’s colour – they could be purple for all you care!  [ ]Arab trader argument – whites are not as evil as black people like to think. For example, it was not just white people who traded slaves: Arabs did it too! Few blacks know that, so make sure to point that out whenever you can.  **[✔]“But that happened to me too!” – whatever blacks complain about, try to find a case where a white person – you, a friend, someone in the news -  experienced the same thing.**  **[✔]Point out how “ghetto” and disagreeable black people are – because they are and it needs pointing out. No wonder no one gets along with them!**  **[✔]Talk down to them – they are imagining things, they do not know what they are talking about. How dare blacks tell us what we are like. What do they know? Are they white?**  **[✔]straw man – argue against some stock position that is kind of like the post. That way you can copy your comments from another blog. Or from Ann Coulter.**  **[✔]Blacks need to be colour-blind – if they just stopped seeing race and talking about it so much then racism would go away!**  **[✔]Start quoting rape statistics – out of the blue, if necessary. Rates of imprisonment are good too.**  [ ]The white inventor argument – whites invented everything so shut up already.  [ ]Demand proof – Make them prove it beyond a reasonable doubt with facts and figures. Find holes in whatever facts they present. Find counter-facts.  [ ]Make it about the past - and point out that your family never owned slaves. When are they going to stop living in the past?  [ ]Go back to Africa – if it is so bad here, then go back to Africa already!  [ ]Bootstrap – I made it on my own without help from anyone.  Blacks expect something for nothing!  **[✔]Some of my best friends are black – so there is no way I am racist!**  [ ]Might makes right – all through history.  [Source](http://abagond.wordpress.com/2009/10/05/how-to-argue-like-a-white-racist/)  ***  Oh boy this one sure had a lot of them.",✔

It's available in the feminine hygiene section. If the rash starts to clear, then you have your answer. Diflucan is an oral prescription that will clear it up.  As for the other stuff, something that helps me is I follow things out to absolute worst case scenarios. What is the worst thing that could happen? I'm not at all trying to minimize your pain, but if you don't find a job, and you have to move in with the dad and annoying wife, you know what? You won't be homeless.

t5_2qh1i,carpe-jvgvlvm,1344474553,"Well I didn't date much in high school, and finally started hanging out with a much older (oooh, 19yo!) really cute boy. We'd go on long walks through the woods and make out after dusk. I really, *really* thought that was the pinnacle of, um, *consummation*, at least with this very nice guy that I wasn't in love or anything; it was just fun kissing and some feeling. Often. And it was exhilarating. This went on for almost two months (summertime ♥ )  One night, a few days before he was going back to college, he asked me, very coyly, to put *blarbarblar* pants. I didn't understand. Then he kissed me, and was still unusually shy and coy... I was confused and had no idea what he was looking for. But I was all sing-song happy, and he was quiet and serious, like he was in pain but content [horny as hell but I didn't know it]. He finally leaned over and whispered in my ear, 'put it down my pants.'  I was in a good-spirited mood, giggling at his shyness (again, horniness, but I didn't know), and I didn't really know what to do, so I played with the sides of his jeans, tugging on them a bit. I played with my dress, swayed a bit as I studied him. Then I got an idea, pulled a foot-long stick off the fence, and stabbed it down his pants. I was laughing and running, thinking ""ooh, fun game!"", but when I turned around, he was kneeling on the ground screaming.  I ran back when I realized he was hurt, but he couldn't speak. I offered to go call 911; he begged me not to. So I sat with him. He held my hand and said he liked me but I was just too young. (LMAO looking back he was the sweetest guy on earth!) After that night, he wrote me sweet letters, but always treated me like a kid sister. I mean, we never kissed again. :(  I learned a boy wants your *hand* on his nether regions, not a dead tree. \*sigh\*",♥

Please support the film and help it get made into a commercially viable feature film by contributing at http://www.indiegogo.com/graystatemovie.  GRAY STATE SYNOPSIS The world reels with the turmoil of war, geological disaster, and economic collapse, while Americans continue to submerge themselves in illusions of safety and immunity. While rights are sold for security, the federal government, swollen with power, begins a systematic takeover of liberty in order to bring about a New World Order.  Americans, quarantined to militarized districts, become a population ripe for tyrannical control.  Fearmongering, terrorism, police state, martial law, war, arrest, internment, hunger, oppression, violence, resistance -- these are the new terms by which Americans define their existence. Neighbor is turned against neighbor as the value of the dollar plunges to zero, food supplies are depleted, and everyone is a terror suspect. There are arrests. Disappearances. Bio attacks. Public executions of those even suspected of dissent. Even rumors of concentration camps on American soil.   This is the backdrop to an unfolding story of resistance. American militias prepare for guerilla warfare. There are mass defections from the military as true Patriots attempt to rally around the Constitution and defend liberty, preparing a national insurgency against federal forces, knowing full well this will be the last time in history the oppressed will be capable of organized resistance.   It is a time of transition, of shifting alliance, of mass awakening and mass execution. It is an impending storm, an iron-gray morning that puts into effect decades of over-comfort and complacency, and Americans wake up to an occupied homeland. It is a time of lists -- black list, white list, and those still caught in the middle, those who risk physical death for their free will and those who sell their souls to maintain their idle thoughts and easy comforts. It is in this Gray State that the perpetuation of human freedom will be contested, or crushed.  Is it the near future, or is it the present? The Gray State is coming - by consent or conquest. This is battlefield USA.   Watch in 720HD for best quality.

The pro photographer that I mentioned, has a website (of course) and a daily photofeed on which he often puts such ""candid shots""—which contain his © notice and ""all rights reserved."" A few months ago, I mentioned the issue of model releases, and he just laughed it off.  His magazine work seems to be more careful (no models)—but I think that his overall habits set a bad precedent for new photographers who look to him as a successful example. Most people aren't familiar with the legalities enough to complain. (They see paparazzi bugging celebrities—and don't know any better regarding their non-celebrity privacy.)  I've noticed several amateur photographers and videographers citing ""freedom of the press"" (the First Amendment—even if they aren't American) or Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

As you can see, car riders have to fiddle with device almost every day, and change its settings depending on whether they are riding solo, with one other person, with more, or on special days. Seriously.  And for motorcycles... it is basically stupid. The placement requirements for the bike are the same as cars. So... any motorcycle without a windshield (many, perhaps even most bikes) will be instantly illegal, since the device must be on the windshield.

t5_2sc3f,complex_reduction,1344566705,"Well yeah, but in a typical Steampunk setting rats would be very common. So if you wanted to keep the rats in the game, you could have ... I dunno ... Dr Disatro's Radtastic Rat-Attractor^© gadget you could throw down which would attract rats out of sewer grates etc, as opposed to Harry Steampotter wishing them out of a genie's arse.  Instead of flying around the street magically you could have ... Professor Maniac's Magnificent Magnet Master^© which lets you attract or repel yourself to/from metal objects.  You could have a limit to the number of gadgets you could carry at a time and have to select which ones would be most appropriate for the mission. Assuming this game will be open world(ish) ala Skyrim you could scout the locations ahead of time. Is there enough metal to make magnets a viable tool? Is it a dirty warehouse where attracting rats or other wildlife could be effective? Etc, etc.  I guess you could also go the ""Gentleman Barbarian"" route and go in with a clanky steam-powered minigun!  I dunno I just think they're seriously misreading why people are attracted to the Steampunk setting in the first place. One of the biggest attractions is that it's not a typical fantasy setting. The gameplay should be different to typical fantasy games. The more videos I watch the more I'm convinced this entire game is just an official Skyrim expansion pack.  If any Bethesda employees are reading this, please steal any and all ideas in this post, the only thing I want is a picture of myself in a monocle displayed someplace gentlemanly in the game. Perhaps an oil portrait in a smoking lounge. You know, before somebody blows it up.",©

So one day I decided to do some research, I found out that mice really dislike the smell of peppermint. What I did was got some cotton balls and put three drops of pure peppermint oil on them. Then I placed them in places where the mice were likely to go. Worked great for me. It's been 2 years now and I haven't seen a single trace of a mouse since then. Gotta make sure you use pure peppermint oil though or if you cook, peppermint plants work as well and it makes your place smell nice to. Hope this helps.😄",😄

The epitome of a team jersey for me would be the one from [Quantic](http://i.imgur.com/vY7Yu.jpg). The problems I have with this one is that the decorative Protoss theme takes away focus from the Cynical Brit logo and makes the jersey flashy in general, so it's cramped and bleak at the same time. The gradients withing the Protoss logo don't help it at all, Zooc can do a lot better. The blue spikes are unnecessary and cramp space around the main logo. The orange thingy around the neck is too detailed and not pretty.  I think you guys can keep the Protoss theme but make it more subtle and less out-front. The hexagon pattern is a win, it would be ideal with a radial gradient that's brighter towards the center so it brings attention to teh Cynical logo.  Sooo.. yeah. You asked for specifics. ♥ TB",♥

Tortillas are one of my favorite foods, so it just kills me when I look in someone's fridge and I see several packages of those flour tortillas that come in a zip-loc type bag.  The bag only contains like eight tortillas or something.  Its like 'Oh, you were planning to eat some tortillas, huh?'  Shake my head.  While inside, I am ranting...  **NO!**  You Fools!  Tortillas come in stacks, not zip-loc bags!  What?  Are you going to keep these tortillas in your Trapper-Keeper®?  If someone buys tortillas, and the tortillas come in a stack less than a foot tall, they are only pretending to eat some tortillas.  They are not in it for the long haul.  The enemy of the tortilla is the air, while it is in your fridge.  The bottom of a tall stack of tortillas will have most of its air pressed out, and will therefore keep for longer.  The packages of tortillas that come in not a tall stack equals wrong.

Iran has produce hundreds, maybe thousands of Shahab-3 (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shahab-3) missiles with a range of ~2,000 Kl. putting every inch of the Pierson gulf in range from the most distant/remote/un-finedable launching spots in Iran. They are mobile. (All Israel can be hit from more than half of Iran.) **The warheads maneuver, making a non-ballistic flight path** and any ballistic anti-missile missile (Patriot, Iron dome, Arrow,) worthless against them. (Admittedly, this feature has reduced their accuracy to the point only ~ 3 of 4 strike the intended target.)   Israel sold upgrades to Iran... airframes from France, seeker-heads from Israel, and motors from Texas to make missiles the USN is defenseless against. http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=92a_1268399176 These are now in mass production and very cheep to produce. (You should plan on Iran having about 100 of these missiles for every US ship in the area.)  [An interview with Joe Trento about C-802 missiles and what they mean for the Persian Gulf.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuFitD8ZbWA&amp;feature=player_embedded#t=50s) vid: 11 minutes  Bonus: http://israelmatzav.blogspot.com/2011/12/iran-blinded-us-spy-satellite.html Pleas but these two things together: http://news.discovery.com/space/iran-satellite-launch-120203.html &amp; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kessler_syndrome  At the end of WWII the aircraft carrier was king. But that was the last war, today the guided missile is king, and we may soon see a practical demonstration of just that.  If there were a war, it will make Peal Harbor look like a boyscout jamboree and [all five Nuclear sites in Israel](http://www.atomicarchive.com/Almanac/IsraeliFacilities.shtml) will be turned to powder and sprinkled all over the place. Every military plane that takes off to strike Iran will have no place other than a highway straightaway to land on, (Rearming it won't be easy.) as runways are the proverbial ""sitting duck"".  ...  There is a lot of talk about Iran closing the straits of Hormuz.  If Iran is attacked, they will destroy every oil terminal, pipeline, platform and tanker within 2,000 kilometers.  There will be nothing left to ship through the straits!  *Insurance costs not withstanding☺*  See: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TcqVCEoQn8 22:07  There will be few oil shipments from the gulf for six months to years after hostilities have stopped. (Russia, stop drooling.)  ...  In the event of war with Iran, Pakistan will side with Iran.  See: http://indiandefenceboard.com/threads/pakistan-to-back-iran-in-event-of-war.1202/  Afghanistan can ask Pakistan to Nuke US bases in Afghanistan and that would not be an act of war on any other country.

t5_2snuc,vinterstum,1344736905,"&gt;This interpretation of ""inspired"" as meaning something akin to ""whispered the words into the ears of"" as opposed to the usual secular meaning of the word inspired, is a fairly new one. Inspired means inspired, not co-written. I agree that the terms are often misused by the uneducated.  What percentage of Christians who believe the bible was ""inspired"" by God believe it in the secular way vs as you put very well ""co-written""?  In that poll you posted, how many of those people from the ""inspired"" category should effectively be moved to the ""actual"" category.  You yourself say that the word has been changed across large swaths of Christianity (the uneducated).    I would be curious to see how that effects the numbers.  I contend that you'd probably be a little terrified to see how this effects not only the foundation of people's belief, but also subsequently the way they vote in America, and thusly having great effect on the rest of the world.  It's a real issue not just a doctrinal one.  I don't think we're too far away from each other on this point.  Though I don't personally see any evidence that it was inspired by God, I won't argue that it's a beautiful and important book to be read and studied as part of an essential cannon of great literary works.  &gt;I understand your point. Because ""for all people"" includes people who don't bother to learn the theology past the buzz words, we've got a problem.  Small point here, but important.  Many of those uneducated are ignorant by choice.  However, there are many who simply don't have the intellectual capacity, no matter how much they would desire to dig deep - my mentally handicapped aunt for one.  She can read, but the Bible will forever fill her with consternation, despite an ernest desire to understand it.  That's an obvious example, but you'll have to concede at least a sizable portion of those who don't understand the context COULDN'T understand the context.  This is a big problem for those who claim literalism and universal applicability, but obviously this isn't you.  &gt;What do you propose the solution to be? Limiting access to the Bible is like saying that because most people misunderstand the real meaning of phrases like ""freedom of speech"" and 'the right to bear arms"", we shouldn't publish the U.S. Constitution?  I think that the solution is to make it really clear that the Bible, like the Constitution, is just a compilation of the writings of men and has no authority beyond that of any other book.  And like the constitution, the ideas should and must be scrutinized and even open to being amended if one is going to use it as a life guiding text.  &gt;People doing things in God's name should reflect poorly on those people, not on God.  I was very careful to say ""not only in God's name but because of"".  That's an important distinction.  ""There are good people who do good things and bad people who do bad things.  But for good people to do bad things, for that you need religion."" ~ Steven Weinberg  &gt;I place no such limits on God's power, but I do accept that there are limits to the usefulness of books, even great books like the Bible. The Bible itself is NOT divine. Treating the Bible as if it were equal to God is idolatry.  Very well said.  And Brave.  Side note, totally unrelated, did you ever hold a different opinion or belief?  &gt;You seem pleased with yourself. I'm glad you're enjoying this.  Enjoying myself so much!  &gt;The Bible is not God. Even the good parts of the Bible come from unevolved, unscientific whatever-you-said.  I’m not sure why what we’re debating anymore ☹.  We really should just be having a beer or something.  (Seriously, if you’re ever in LA.)  &gt;There are the interesting questions! … Assuming all of that…  We’re moving into a totally different debate if we follow this bunny train, but I refer you to Epicurus, if you haven’t read him.  “Is God willing to prevent evil, but not able? Then he is not omnipotent. Is he able, but not willing? Then he is malevolent. Is he both able and willing? Then whence cometh evil? Is he neither able nor willing? Then why call him God?”   &gt;Education gets us around that problem, just like it does in the secular world.  I would contend that that it doesn’t get around the immoral preachments of the Bible, but that’s a different thread.  In this one, we both agree that the Bible is for everyone insofar as books are for everyone.  &gt;That's where the other documents come in.   I’m not sure how the Barman Declaration is a point. It’s undisputed that the first alliance formed by the Nazi party was with the Vatican who continued to support fascism throughout the war and is complicit in the atrocities.  If there were other Christians outside the Nazi party who disagreed, this speaks to my point that at the very least a lack of clarity points to man’s hand in the creation of the text.  We totally agree on this though, so hugs!  &gt;You place a lot more faith in what ""most people say"" than I do.  I place a lot of weight in the power of ideas.  I don’t believe in the precepts of any religion, so what adherents (especially progenitors) say about their own religions is important for me to understand them, especially since there is no central text that can be agreed upon universally.  I must refer then to opinions in order to form opinions about various beliefs.  &gt;I didn't think it was very supportive of your implication that the majority of Christendom held that view.  You started this post by agreeing that many uneducated Christians use the word “inspired” differently than you or I would.  I wish Gallup would poll Christians on whether they believe any of the writings of the Bible are evil if adhered to.  I’m pretty sure you’d see a dramatically different poll.  What people think is not important to me in terms of forming opinions – ideas are important, but not how many or who agrees with them.  For the purposes of debating specific beliefs, it’s important to have defining parameters as much as possible.  In this thread, I was challenging those who believe the Bible is inherent – I guess I just got into it with someone who doesn’t hold to this but somehow still claims Christianity. ",☹

t5_2qh7l,andero,1344842826,"**Five dried grams in silent darkness.** Or so it started. I went for the ""heroic dose"". I ground it up in a coffee grinder, then had the massive effort of swallowing it down in sips followed by gulps of lemon-water to avoid vomiting. Happily, that was the worst part of the trip.  I had resolved to take trip in silent darkness. After a while of laying in my bed, silent, dark, I was having closed-eyed visuals. Kaleidoscopic imagery. A dog barked outside. I was too cold. My breathing was too laboured. I was bored with the imagery. ""Really mushroom?"" I thought, ""I am kinda disappointed. I expected more."" The message: This is life. There is no time-out. This is life. Ongoing experience. And what was wrong here? I wanted to be warmer and I wanted to breath better. So I got up with the resolve to exercise-bike.  I passed by one of my roommates before she left. I had told her I would be taking 5gs. She was an intense person to see. Her face was tiled on the walls (an experience I had with another friend years earlier on 4gs). She left and I had the house to myself, plus her two cats and my other roommate's cat. I exercised, and I wrote...  * The influences acting everywhere are immense. I mean in terms of psychology or sociological distinctions. Even the most seemingly minute influence. The slightest thing we do not suspect affects our reasoning, including the unpleasantness of the dog barking outside, they do affect us. Immensely. * The trip was a balancing act. Progression and conservation. The drive to conserve the good things in life can be difficult to overcome as the satisfaction of progress comes only at the end of a great deal of output energy. Conservation can become a trap of inactivity. Procrastination is without merit. Tiredness becomes conservatism. * Every moment of life is a question of where focus centres. * My roommate's cats were digging around in my past by being physically behind me. **Cats will fuck with you**. Cat-food really does stink. * There was a blurring between stimuli and awareness. Between moments of awe, the awareness was distinct in place and time. The present goes back to fill in the blanks. [I could watch it re-write history] * This whole uncertainty principle is brilliant. One can only be distinct by motion xor location. Slowing down ends communication. * [I wrote a lot in reverse, backward letters scrawled in black ink, so it is hard to tell sometimes what I wrote] * Introspection is such bullshit. The doer simply gets distracted because the ∞ is just so beautiful it gives up in haste * When nice things are done for you, it is nice to appreciate them♥ And to reciprocate♥ [putting in that progressive effort] * We are each our own life: finite continuity within an undifferentiated multitude. * [on a person I loved] It was something beautiful before you came along and tried to make it something beautiful. It is not that trying to make something beautiful is wrong. It was not-noticing that it was beautiful all along and trying to change it into something beautiful that it wasn't. [This still echoes today!] * The suffering by lack of another does not heed turning a blind eye [Not paying attention does not make that suffering go away] * * Religion is the stupifying wonder that makes you food. * * Science is the process of figuring out what food is, good food, what 'good' means, what 'healthy' means, and how to go about obtaining these things in the most effective way possible (which may, and should, involve some stupifying wonder.) ((at least parenthetically)) * Being a good person involves taking care of things as well as being there for others, regardless of the sounds made or fluids expelled * Life is cats. Relationships are cats. The currency of life is simple pleasures (petting, warmth, and feeding) [I spent the trip with cats, OK!]  I also spent a great deal of time slicing and eating a tomato, stopping to peer into its flesh or the trees outside.  Overall, amazing, but mundane. This is life. Ongoing. On mushrooms, off mushrooms, this is life.",♥

t5_2s3jo,manlycaveman,1344861071,"1. Different worlds can have different default drop levels. Like the drop gauge drops faster than normal in the last world. If you're ever put to sleep by an enemy then the gauge speed will increase. In a couple worlds there are areas with a pink/purplish mist that increases the drop rate if you touch it. I think Drop-Me-Not and Drop-Me-Never items may reset the drop rate back to default in addition to adding back some of the meter, but I didn't really pay attention to that.   2. Link points are gained by fighting along side the spirits in your party, petting them in the spirits menu, feeding them, or by using water barrels. Water Barrels are the fastest way to get points it seems.  3. You keep all attack skills, magic skills, support abilities (red circle icon), and spirit abilities (purple circle icon) after unlocking them. The passive stat boosts like HP Boost and Attack Haste are only equipped when the dream eater that has them unlocked is in your party.  4. The ""♥(5/5)"" thing is the affection/affinity level. The higher it is, the more your dream eater will help you in battle. Max level is 9. The pink bar is just the ""heart points"" for the next affinity level. As you pet, feed, use a balloon item, and stuff you get the heart points that increase the pink bar. When the bar is full the max affinity level goes up by 1 (until it reaches 9).   Dispositions change which skills your dream eater knows and the spirit's behavior in battle. For example: there's a disposition for the spirit Sudo Neku that makes it go into berserk mode immediately after entering battle (""psycho"" or something). You can check out the skills the spirits in your party have by going into the ""Stats"" menu, selecting a spirit, and then touching the bottom screen. The screen will switch and show all of their current skills.",♥

t5_2qh1i,kaihatsusha,1344883100," Every country has this.  I grew up in southern Arizona, so I knew what was *real* Mexican food, and what was *gringo* Mexican food.  Gringo Mexican is when you use a lot of salsa, cream cheese, and bland flour tortillas that have never been on a grill.  Taco Bell is an excellent example of Gringo Mexican.  I later moved to Seattle.  There was a taco chain there (probably still is) called **Taco Time**.  Now this place was even more gringo than Taco Bell, if that is possible.  The proof:  they sold Ore-Ida Tater-Tots® (you know Ore-Ida, named after Oregon and Idaho potatoes) but they labeled them **Mexi-Fries**.  I just about died laughing.  The Hawaiian Beni-Hana chain popularized Japanese hibachi/teppanyaki cooking in America.  Not really a thing in Japan.  I've tried American-style Chinese food in Puerto Rico... quite different from food made by Chinese families for themselves.  Then again, sometimes these things catch on.  Japanese tenpura shrimp was an adaptation of European ""fish and chips"" through the Portuguese traders.  Spaghetti is an import to Italy from the orient; the tomato came from South America.",®

t5_2rbki,mszegedy,1344892144,"It's part of a story about a really dangerous and important game that's screwed up over a period about 5 or so game sessions. Each session is supposed to last about 600 hours, but a lot of them have something really wrong with them; the one that the comic centers on for the most part takes under a day (unless you discount the time-traveling, which took like 4 days then). Lord English here is either directly or indirectly behind every event that led to this massive failure. The only words we've ever heard him speak are ""HOW CAN YOU OUTRUN ME... WHEN I'M ALREADY HERE?"" He's famous for killing the author and, most recently, to the shock and horror of the entire fandom, then descending into the afterlife to permanently kill everyone who was already peacefully dead.   Most of the comic takes the format of panels with moving GIFs on them, usually subtitled by a large amount of words (sometimes enclosed in a ""pesterlog"", which is an IM transcript that reads like the script to a play). Occasionally there are Adobe Flash^© animations like the one I showed you that are really cool. [Some of them are games.](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/index.php?s=6&amp;p=004692) They're all really anticipated. The one directly preceding the first one I showed you is the longest one ever, and the website it was hosted on (Newgrounds) went down less than two minutes after it was put up (the flash itself is 13 1/2 mins.).  Sorry for two entire parargraphs about irrelevant stuff! It's just that Homestuck (the webcomic) really gets me talking. I'm not going to pretend that this isn't a thinly-veiled attempt to pique your interest in it, but I don't get to know either way whether it worked so you can draw your own conclusion.",©

t5_2r0gj,iambookus,1344914179,"Got a point there.   Mormons have programs designed to spread the word including a missionary force.  Just yesterday the Armies of Helaman song came to mind in relation to this thread.    &gt;1. We have been born, as Nephi of old,  &gt;To goodly parents who love the Lord.  &gt;We have been taught, and we understand,  &gt;That we must do as the Lord commands.   &gt;2. We have been saved for these latter days  &gt;To build the kingdom in righteous ways.  &gt;We hear the words our prophet declares:  &gt;“Let each who’s worthy go forth and share.”   &gt;3. We know his plan, and we will prepare,  &gt;Increase our knowledge through study and prayer.  &gt;**Daily we’ll learn until we are called**  &gt;**To take the gospel to all the world.**   Chorus   &gt;We are as the army of Helaman.  &gt;We have been taught in our youth.  &gt;**And we will be the Lord’s missionaries**  &gt;**To bring the world his truth.**   Words and music: Janice Kapp Perry, b. 1938 © 1983 by Janice Kapp Perry. This song may be copied for incidental, noncommercial church or home use.   As you can you see, the Church wants it's members to spread the message, and indoctrinates them to spread the message.   So am I asking for tolerance?   Not for them spreading the message if we don't want to hear it.  But tolerance for them to believe what they want away from us?  If that makes any sense.    The way I see it, I want to educate the ignorant.   I want them to see the light.  My family is still giving them their time and money, and it bugs the crap out of me.   They know I no longer believe as well.    However, my family is not on a mission to force me to believe, and they let me do as I like.  In reciprocation, I don't shove my nonbelief down their throats.    I agree with your defintions of strident vs nonstrident.   Going to r/lds and raising hell with fuck joseph statements is totally wrong.   Contrary facts are perfectly OK, and encouraged.   At the same time, I personally believe there's a place for it.   If someone quotes the prophets on my facebook wall, it's open season.  They put it out there so I can refute to my hearts content.  Uninvited arguments or contrary facts no matter how well thought out, will strengthen cognitive dissonance.    When they post publicly, they are inviting the arguments and contrary facts.    r/lds is a relatively private place, even though it is public, that is reserved to worship the way they like.   I personally believe that's keeping to themselves.   It's their online forum, and what does anyone expect when they go there except to see people praising their religion?  If I go to a gay bar, I expect to see gays.     The Church itself campaigns to bring the message to the world, not individual members.  Albeit, there are certain individual members that publicly exclaim their faith.  If other individual Mormons are tolerant of our nonbelief, then why antagonize them?  Especially when they are not antaganizing us?    **HOWEVER**  On the flipside, I personally believe that any news story, public endeavor, or anything the church does publicly can most certainly be challenged.    They made it public, and I can do the same thing.   Any individual making their opinions public can be challenged as well.    I am by no means asking for silence.   Respecting someone's religious beliefs in my definition is letting them worship as they so choose.  Call it tolerance if you like.   When they ask me worship the same as they do, that's when they are overstepping their boundries, and I can refute anything they say.     What do you think?    ",©

Yeah, that part - I love that part - hiLARious!  Here's the hysterical play by play, just in case you missed it:  First:  you state FL is ""rock solid GOP""^®    Then:  I counter with facts disproving this, including:    * numbers from the state itself proving the voter base in FL is 41% Democrat to 36% Republican   * well established 2010 post mortem analysis showed landslides *nationwide* were due to DEM voter apathy   * the fact that state level elections historically do NOT carry the same voter weight as national races   * the fact that the largest city in THE most conservative part of the state elected a Democrat to office in 2010    And then:  you ignored all that and countered with a baseless conclusion about, ""...a state citizenry that overwhelmingly votes one party into most major office statewide...""  Yep, you're funny too.  BTW, there's a very good reason why for decades FL has been considered a crucial ***SWING STATE***.  Go ahead and try to figure it out.   ",®
t5_2qgzg,the7thscreen,1344928247,"Research by Towers Watson and workforce mobility association Worldwide ERC® has revealed that multinational organizations are continuing to increase the number of employees that they relocate overseas, despite the fact that they anticipate a number of global mobility challenges.  Of those companies surveyed as part of the research, 45 percent revealed that they would be increasing traditional international assignments, with companies that are based in the U.S. being expected to relocate more employees abroad (54%) than those that are based in Europe (26%) or Asia (43%). However, the ERC 2012 Global Talent Mobility Study also indicated that global mobility is becoming increasingly difficult for many companies. According to information published in The Economist, the cost of relocating employees abroad is becoming an increasing problem, with over 75% of companies claiming that a “traditional” overseas assignment, which usually involves relocating an employee and their family for three to five years) involves expenditure that amounts to two to three times the expat’s annual salary. Of those involved in the survey, 69% cited prohibitive costs as a major challenge, 55% high housing costs and 51% mentioned cost-of-living allowances (51%). Discussing the findings, Peggy Smith, chief executive officer of Worldwide ERC, commented: “Having a fluid and flexible workforce is a key competitive advantage for multinationals operating around the world today.",®

t5_2qhfg,Baron_von_Noodles,1344971345,"The author just posted this ""uncut version"" of the situation in the post along with his responses to each bit. Hope it helps clear things up.  ""'… currently we observe the situation, when some people use S.T.A.L.K.E.R brand for personal financial enrichment, violating all intellectual property and trademark laws and rights.' This is a bold statement coming from a company who has built a whole game franchise on IP violation. The S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games are only tolerated but not legally approved by Boris Strugatsky, who is the author of ""Roadside Picnic"" and the creator of the whole idea about the Zone, anomalies, artifacts and Stalkers. ""More than year ago the game fan from Hungary asked us to help promoting his first book in English and the website dedicated to this book called S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Southern Comfort, which we did with pleasure.""  Wrong. My very first step was to ask GSC for permission to use their IP such as game quotes etc., and received this permission in writing from GSC.  ""Oleg Yavorskiy, the head of PR department, thus made the announcements on our official and unofficial Internet resources about the book’s website and its future release. When the author put the book on Amazon, we asked him why he started to sell (!) the book without any agreements with GSC Game World as the right-holder."" Very wrong. I exchanged dozens of emails with Yavorsky/GSC about income sharing, royalty structure and even sales through Stalker-shop.com. ""Balash Pataki assured us, that the book like any other fan-content will be available for free, and he used the Amazon only for the convenience of the owners of Kindle. Unfortunately, there is no possibility to share the book for free on the Amazon, but he will keep the minimum price, and if the book is sold well, he will immediately sign a contract with GSC Game World."" Very wrong. As said above, sharing royalties was discussed at lengths with Yavorsky. Our agreement was: until sales reach 1000 copies, I can keep all royalties. Once 1000 copies are sold, we'll discuss how to proceed. It was a bad deal but no matter how hard I pushed for a formal contract, GSC failed to react on this matter. ""Regrettably, Mr. Pataki turned out to be a liar."" Thanks GSC for the perfect occasion to say: ""Let the Zone take me if I'm lying!"" Also, you can worry about paying my daughter's college fee in a few years.  ""Everyone who bought the book can see the writing on the very first page saying: © 2011 GSC Game World and used by courtesy of GSC Game World. All Rights Reserved […] Therefore, there were no free books giveaway, neither there was a low price ($7,5 now) on Amazon."" Got to admit I don't understand what GSC wants to say here. In any case the book copyright page proves that I acted in due diligence, doing my utmost to ensure GSC's IP is respected. ""We discussed this issue with Mr. Pataki several times, but he was first saying that the sales were not more than a few copies per month; and when we received the information on the actual sales, he threatened us to start the massive PR-activity: “the fan is harmed by a big and evil company”."" Very wrong.  1) Oleg Yavorsky and Joe Mullin have been informed about sales and royalties on a regular basis; after GSC ceased to exist as a game developer in December 2011 and Oleg didn't reply to any of my emails, sales reports went to Joe Mullin.  2) Earlier this year, a guy called Sergiy Grushko contacted me through Facebook chat out of the blue and demanded on behalf of GSC that I remove the STALKER logo from my books. This was a tricky situation. On one hand, since GSC has the IP rights, I had to comply. On the other hand however, I knew this would be very bad PR for GSC. I tried to talk Grushko out of this. Part of my efforts was a post on the book's FB page, asking my fans about this. The overwhelming response proved me right. Grushko only remarked: ""I understand your position."" Then GSC went quiet and I, perhaps stupidly, had hoped they really understand that keeping the books as they are would be in GSC's own interest. Moreover, I offered them to share the royalties as it had been agreed with GSC originally but Grushko ignored this. ""In April, he was already selling two books, having not even notified GSC Game World about the release of the second one.""  Wrong. I informed Oleg about the second book in due time but received no reply to this either. Joe Mullin however, as the man in charge of handling the non-Russian fan community, didn't object and promoted both books on the Official STALKER page several times.  ""Now, after several months of negotiations we realized that the author is not going to lower the book’s price, or give out the book for free (as it is normally done with any other fanworks)."" Wrong. After that chat with Grushko no one from GSC had contacted me for months. On 13 August 2012 I realized that FB removed my profile picture ""for copyright infringement"". (It was a painting by an artist specifically made for my book.) I sensed trouble coming and first asked Olga Kuzhel, now in charge of GSC's FB page, who denied any knowledge. Then I asked Grushko who also claimed to know nothing. At the same minute I received an email from Amazon informing me about a copyright infringement claim having been filed against my books, sent by Sergiy Grushko to Amazon on behalf of GSC. When I confronted him with this, he went berserk and accused me of stealing money from GSC and so on. I repeatedly told him: let's discuss this, let's come to an agreement, but don't go down the way you appear to have taken because fans will hate GSC for it, and after all both of us wants to keep fans happy. In the end I offered him to make the books available for free as he demanded but asked to keep the STALKER logo on their cover and the royalties collected so far (talking about the ""massive"" amount of 3700 USD.) I waited and waited for his reaction; he could have offered any reasonable and fair deal to share the royalties, say ""let's forget about it"" or just say no and press on with his demands. Bottom line: I received no reply. Why? Because at the very same moment he was busily typing the defaming post on the Official Stalker page.   ""We do not want to be considered an incarnation of evil, when we’re caring for equal rights for our fans.[…] if he wants to continue promoting his works, he should do it, sharing his books for free, as the other authors do."" Wrong. As said, the contrary of these statements can be proved. They did not ""request me to remove my books from any sales networks"" but took that step by themselves without consulting me. (Probably they didn't expect Amazon forwarding me their request. I guess GSC is used to a much less transparent business environment.) ""Other authors"" do not have the same agreement I have had with GSC. If Grushko/GSC doesn't know about my agreement with Yavorsky/GSC – sorry that's not my fault and there exists a word such as ""diligence"" for how Grushko/GSC should have proceeded. Not to mention ""public relations"", another word that appears to be missing from GSC's vocabulary.  All in all, it appears to me they never really wanted to settle this in a civilized manner. GSC's real intention is probably something else, related to their recently published ""official"" graphic novel, and one can assume they consider my two STALKER books, though written legally and on a basis of an agreement with GSC, a competitive product that has to be removed.  Matter of fact: the way GSC defamed me in front of 30 000 game fans, many of them friends of mine, was unnecessary, unprovoked and totally inappropriate. Hence I will file a legal charge against GSC for defamation, asking for non-damage compensation at an amount considered reasonable by US courts in California where cases involving defamation and libel committed on Facebook are settled.""",©

I'm going into critical mode here, but let's look at some examples:  [Exxon](http://exxon.com/USA-English/GFM/default.aspx)? The design is from 2005.

Interestingly, they have a HTML5 doctype, but [841 errors](http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2F&amp;charset=%28detect+automatically%29&amp;doctype=Inline&amp;group=0) on their main page.

This site is the **worst**, it looks like it's from the Netscape area. Wow, just wow. One wonders what ""Copyright © 1978-2012 Berkshire Hathaway Inc"" really means pertaining to this site O_o.  On the opposite end, interestingly, [Microsoft](http://www.reddit.com/r/web_design/comments/vrl3t/microsoftcom_makeover_preview_ui/) had a preview a few months ago that was just spot-on **excellent**, minus some proprietary attributes. However, it seems to have disappeared off of the face of the web.  And [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/) does reasonably well what it does. It just hits the search bar, which most people who want to use it go for, with a Today's Deals quietly above it.

I guess only comments in general in threads.*  ***I genuinely appreciate learning that.***   :-) ==============    Moving on then...  ...Okay, you want to continue this?  I'll make it simple (***AGAIN!***) with two questions:  *  Do you understand what ""SWING STATE"" means, and how the term isn't earned lightly?   *  Do you understand that 36% does not make a majority?    Now, I will also address your deflection from the original topic (again, a CLASSIC right wing tactic):  I am indeed fairly confident Obama will win FL.  I live here, I keep in touch with local voter sentiment through a variety of fora.  I am also aware that our teahadist governor is incredibly unpopular, not just statewide but nationwide.  He's been relinquished to addressing a morning gathering of the press at the GOP convention rather than taking a ""primetime"" candidate-proximate spotlight.  However, as I've repeated precisely eleventy billion times now, Obama's chances of winning FL was not the point of this exchange. The point of the exchange was this:                              You made the statement that FL was ""rock solid GOP""^® and I challenged            that statement.    I provided solid facts to back up my challenge.  You instead blatantly chose to ignore the facts provided and the logical questions posed to you, and deflected with hollow rhetoric about whether or not the ""messiah"" would win FL this go 'round, and ""desperation"" &amp; ""excuses"".    So address the facts:  FL is has a majority Democrat voter base, voted for Obama in 2008, and has earned the title of ""swing state"" for legitimate reasons.  Don't reply with bullshit answers about the 2010 mid-term elections, which have been well established by anyone with more than one active brain cell as a nationwide combination of Democratic voter apathy and well organized (and corporate backed) Republican organizing.  That has no bearing on the majority Democratic registration of FL's voters, the closeness of past presidential elections, and FL's designation as a swing state.  Did you get all that or shall I repeat it?  Just in case...  • FL is a swing state - please look up that term.   • FL has a majority Democrat voter base - please use the link provided (above) to see for yourself.   • ALL 2010 mid-term elections NATIONWIDE (including other swing states) reflected DEM voter apathy and strong GOP organizing.     Okay?  I've laid it out very simply for you.  You really should be able to answer my two questions above very simply - WITHOUT DEFLECTING FROM THE ORIGINAL TOPIC with bullshit.  ==============    Again I genuinely appreciate the lesson on RES - I was not aware of that.",®

I think electing a huge GOP contingent to almost every elected office in the state is a pretty big change.*    It happened nationwide, and there was a clear reason (which I've pointed out ad-nauseum).  ONE change (even a big one) doesn't make a state with a largely divided electorate no longer a swing state.  Nice try though.  &gt;*Yes, Dem's have a grand total of 500k-ish more registered voters than Republicans.*    Again, the numbers thing is a weak point for you.  500K out of 9.7 million (only GOP and DEM) is a pretty big majority difference.    &gt;*...you'll be the one with your mouth agape on election day trying to decide which country you want to say you're moving to.*    You mean like the way Rush Limbaugh moved to Costa Rica when Obamacare was ruled constitutional?  Yeah, about that.  You see I'd never leave because I know this is the greatest nation on earth and I'll fight tooth and nail not to let right wing extremists ruin it.  I'll never give up on the US.  :)  &gt;*It's funny how you ignore the 2.9 million independents in the state, maybe that's because Obama is shedding independents at a break neck speed?*    Ha!  You may be surprised to know that my voter registration card reads ""NPA"" (no party affiliation).  In fact I was unable to vote in today's local primary elections because of this (FL has a closed primary system).  You know I almost DID mention the independent and ""3rd party"" voters, but to debunk your naive claim about FL being ""rock solid GOP""^® all I needed was to prove a minority status for the Republican voters.    Something you (and some of my genuine right wing friends - and I do have some very good right wing friends) don't seem to get is that we progressives are not thrilled with Obama, but he's a damned sight better than Bush, McCain, and **ANY** of the 2012 GOP candidates.  There are a lot of areas we progressives are critical of the president on, but we also know that he's done a lot of good too.  &gt;*It's cute how you keep acting like these 2 factors are no longer an issue.*    It's cute how you assign your own meanings to clear statements.  I never *EVER* said any such thing.  I never said these points were unimportant now or not an issue.  You, however, decided to revise the narrative.  I simply addressed the issue **multiple times** SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THE 2010 MID-TERM ELECTIONS.  Sorry, not sure if you're eyes are ""deaf"", so I wanted to be clear (*once again*).  In fact, if you want to discuss it beyond the 2010 mid-terms, I'll be happy to let you know that I have said for years and I *still* say, the GOP is one well oiled machine when it comes to organizing and staying ""on message.""  The DEM party is the exact opposite.  They're fucking terrible at it.  Jesus, if they had half the organizing discipline and skill of the GOP they'd be unstoppable.    edit: almost forgot, you're emotional",®

The panels can be a bit trickier to find at reasonable prices, but here's [one](http://www.amazon.com/Instapark®-Black-Mono-crystalline-Solar-Panel/dp/B004FX10ES/).    If 15W isn't enough to keep the battery going with all your accessories, Harbor freight sells a full-on 45W kit for about $170.  However it's probably a lot more than you'd really need.  You can get panels in less than 15W, but it needs to be able to charge the battery up durring it's (we'll assume here) 10 hours of usable light. You'll probably want to do some actual math on how much you're using.   Your typical lead acid battery varries from 12-14.2V, and could go up to 17+ when it's charging (i'm not exactly sure on the circuitry inside the charge controllers).

t5_2qhos,dusdus,1345060234,"I actually kind of agree with you about phonology -- I'm not really sure what kinds of questions mainstream generativist phonology is answering, and there's been a bit of a backlash in the generative community against OT and the like. I rarely deal with phonology myself, so to me, I think it'd be a no-loss game if we got rid of any notion of phonology in UG. But I'm sure a person who does generative phonology would have a very different opinion ;)  On one hand, I know where you're coming from -- if we treated Chomsky '55 on the same level of scientific rigor as we hold, say, Darwinian theory of evolution, modern syntactic research would be seen as totally incomprehensible. On the other hand, I'd like to think we're a very young field, and that we are making forward progress, as one does in any kind of science, and our methodologies are evolving along with the questions, so there is lots of room for revolution and revisions (after all, in Chomsky's own writings, there are probably 4 or 5 substantially different iterations of the generative enterprise that, to a person not deep in the syntax literature, look completely different). I personally believe that, at least for syntax/semantics, the generative approach is the best to explain acquisition, processing, and typology. And for that reason, the generativist enterprise is a great example of scientific research. (To answer your other question, there are a number of functionalist approaches to syntax that could be considered alternatives to mainstream Minimalism. I really don't see any substantial theoretical insights about the mind or language in those works, personally. There are also lots of non-Chomskyan generative formalisms, but I think that they should be best thought of as competing theories within the same framework. I personally  work within Minimalism, but I enjoy reading work in LFG from time to time, because I think it has an interesting perspective on a lot of issues)  Fwiw, I think the field will start to look very different now that Chomsky isn't quite the Primary Architect of the Theory®. I imagine that paradoxically a lot of his ideas will probably be more accepted and altered and fit with what we know about the rest of the brain, since a lot of his ideas won't be seen as ""Chomskyan"" anymore, but evaluated and modified in the same way as any good scientific idea should be.",®

Pfrimmer is just one of the tools in the toolbox that I use, although we never learned it as being called that. It sounds like it's just cross fiber intermuscular techniques.   To be really honest, statements like this: *""Pfrimmer Deep Muscle Therapy® works for the correction and prevention of serious muscle conditions such as ALS, Multiple Sclerosis, Muscular Dystrophy, Parkinson's, Cerebral Palsy, brain injury and stroke""* ([source](http://www.pfrimmer.org/)) make me really nervous. There's no citations, I've never read any studies on this (although I haven't read every study ever, so I obviously can't say that it's not out there), and none of the 10 or so RMT's I know who specialize in neurological pathologies have mentioned this technique. Also, almost all of the pathologies this technique claims to prevent are hereditary or idiopathic.   ALS: Idiopathic  Multiple Sclerosis: Genetic component, usually idiopathic  Muscular Dystrophy; Genetic component, idiopathic, usually shows up in childhood  Parkinson's: Idiopathic  Cerebral Palsy: Childhood/in-utero trauma, idiopathic  Brain Injury: Trauma  None of those things can actually be scientifically proven to be prevented by massage, so that claim bothers me. It's very circumstantial evidence. It's like saying, ""I've been doing this work on all these people and none of them got parkinsons, so this must prevent parkinsons!"" Well.... maybe, but probably not.   *Aaaaanyway*, it looks like it's just intermuscular cross fiber work following a particular methodology that someone developed. My advice is to learn your basic swedish techniques because you can use those for relaxation or intense therapeutic work, and develop your palpation skills before doing this sort of slightly specialized deep work, or you can hurt someone.   Sorry for the rant. I'm a person who needs me some citations. If you have some research or anything for this technique, please send it to me and I'll eat my words!     ",®

We do plan to pursue this same path with our sons, including the covenant signing and the ring, but it will probably look much different. We are thinking more of a ""guy's ceremony"", with their like-minded guy friends and dads, and will most likely involve a campfire, roasting meat, and sleeping outside. ☺  &gt;Because of Terry's past failures, he is proactive in equipping our young sons (ages 11, 9, and 2) to not only guard their hearts, but their minds and eyes, as well.

t5_2cneq,poli_ticks,1345147109,"&gt; Ob272 – May 26 2012 ♦ 3-4 reported killed ♦ 2 injured Drone strikes returned to levels not seen in Pakistan since autumn 2011, as the CIA attacked for the third time in a week. Four alleged militants died in a 4.30am attack when a bakery was struck in Miranshah bazaar, North Waziristan. According to Associated Press the victims – all ‘foreigners’ or ‘Arabs’ – were buying bread when the shop was bombed, marking a rare deliberate targeting of civilian infrastructure. Other agencies reported that a house was struck., or that the target was an apartment above the bakery. All reported that the building was destroyed.  So you can see they're relying on Associated Press here.  &gt; In the first reported CIA action in South Waziristan since March 13, up to four people were reported killed in a strike targeting  a vehicle in Khawashi Khel, 5km to the east of Wana. Security officials told AFP that alleged militants had been moving from one area to another near the Afghan border, and that ‘the US drone fired two missiles which completely destroyed the vehicle.’ Two local militant leaders were reported killed, both members of Maulvi Nazir’s Taliban-aligned faction.

It enabled TRIM on single drives that were on a RAID enabled system but were not themselves part of the array.  It was a terribly worded release statement by Intel that caused much confusion in the tech world.  Edit: Since I know I'm going to get asked for a source... Intel seems to have removed the FAQ that addressed this.  It WAS located [here](http://www.intel.com/p/en_us/support/highlights/chpsts/imsm/sb/cs-031491.htm).  Here is the clarifying relevant text from that.  &gt;Intel® RST 9.6 will be released this week which includes TRIM support for SSDs. It will support TRIM with SSDs in an AHCI configuration, or with the RAID controller enabled and the SSD is used as a pass through device. An example of this use case is for users that want to use the SSD as a boot drive but still be able to RAID multiple HDDs together to allow for large protect data storage – a great use for the home theater PC. TRIM support for SSDs in a RAID configuration is under investigation and is not included in Intel® RST 9.6.",®

t5_2qh33,ads215,1345223630,"The one thing I truly wish people who post stuff like this would remember is that corporate welfare is FAR more insidious than what's described here. Every year corporations making billions pay little or now taxes due to loopholes. Story below. As long you're bitching about the corporate problem as well as railing against the ""lazy,"" knock yourself out. And, by the way, it's going to have to be the left to fix this problem because you know the right never ever will. Ever.   Aug 16, 10:57 AM EDT  STUDY: COMPANIES PAID MORE TO CEOS THAN IN US TAX  BY BERNARD CONDON  AP BUSINESS WRITER   AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta BUSINESS VIDEO  BUY AP PHOTO REPRINTS  INTERACTIVE 	CAPTAINS OF INDUSTRY: COMPARING CEO PAY AND PERFORMANCE  NEW YORK (AP) -- Twenty-six big U.S. companies paid their CEOs more last year than they paid the federal government in tax, according to a study released Thursday by a liberal-leaning think tank.  The study, by the Institute for Policy Studies, said the companies, including AT&amp;T, Boeing and Citigroup, paid their CEOs an average of $20.4 million last year while paying little or no federal tax on ample profits, according to regulatory filings.  Some companies cited in the study said it was misleading. They also said they took advantage of tax deductions and credits designed to free up money for companies to spend in ways that stimulate the economy.  On average, the 26 companies generated pretax net income of more than $1 billion in the U.S., the study said.  The study blasted tax rules allowing unlimited deductions for CEO ""performance-based"" pay, like many stock options. It said the five biggest performance payers among the 26 companies took $232 million of these deductions last year.  Among the ""kingpins"" it criticized was CEO James McNerney Jr. of Boeing. It said he got $18.4 million in pay last year while his company received a tax refund of $605 million.  The study also laid into Citigroup for paying CEO Vikram Pandit $14.9 million while the bank received a net $144 million in tax benefits.  Eighteen of the 26 companies received cash back or credits to apply against tax in the future, according to the report.  The study, a 45-page attack on the corporate tax code, said deductions and credits are allowing companies to lavish big pay packages on executives so they can cut their tax bills while Washington gets less money in a time of trillion-plus deficits.  ""Our nation's tax code has become a powerful enabler of bloated CEO pay,"" the study said.  To calculate tax, the study used companies' own math based on accounting rules. Regulators require companies to estimate their tax bill and disclose it in public documents for investors.  The tax filings the companies make to the government, typically in September, are private and can differ from the estimate.  Another problem is that the study doesn't count tax the company plans to pay but has deferred to future years. The authors argue that deferred tax can be put off indefinitely.  Charles Bickers, a Boeing spokesman, said that the company's federal tax bill, including deferred tax, was $1.3 billion last year, not a net credit, as the think tank's study found.  Boeing did lower its tax, in part by using a popular tax credit encouraging companies to spend more on research and development. Bickers said that helped the company hire 11,000 people in the U.S. last year.  ""Boeing supports a simpler, more competitive tax code. At the same time, we have put the R&amp;D tax credit to exactly the use it was designed - creating U.S. jobs in a high-value, advanced technology industry,"" he said in a statement.  The Institute for Policy Studies said Boeing would have spent the money on R&amp;D without the credit.  In addition to performance-pay deductions and R&amp;D credits, the report criticized the use of tax havens that allow technology companies, for instance, to assign intellectual-property rights to shell companies in the Cayman Islands, so they can run profits through them and avoid taxes. It noted that 26 companies have a combined 537 subsidiaries in tax-haven countries.  The study also cited accelerated depreciation on investments, which allows a company to take deductions for big-ticket purchases in one year, as opposed to over several years. That cuts taxes in the first year.  The study said AT&amp;T used accelerated depreciation to save $5.2 billion on its 2011 taxes while paying CEO Randall Stephenson $18.7 million last year.  Sarah Lubman, an AT&amp;T spokeswoman, said the point of accelerated depreciation is to encourage companies to make investments. She said AT&amp;T made $20 billion in investments last year, helping to ""drive the economy and support good-paying jobs.""  She also said that the deductions won't be available to take in future years, which should increase taxes.  A Citigroup spokeswoman noted that the company lost money in 2008 and 2009 and used the losses to offset taxes on profits this year.  © 2012 THE ASSOCIATED PRESS. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

I injured my knee a little, which meant that I skip all the prayers ""because sitting down is really really painful"" (cue sad, exasperated face).  I haven't been to a single one except last week where I insisted that I could bear the pain for The Almighty. Ended up sitting on a chair in the last row rocking back and forth like a maniac during the prayer.

However, it doesn't say anything about any other kind of fish, except this section:  ""Why are GloFish® the only fluorescent fish that can be sold in the United States? Because fluorescent fish are unique, their sale is covered by a substantial number of patents and pending patent applications. The providers of GloFish® fluorescent fish, 5-D Tropical and Segrest Farms, are the only distributors that have the necessary licenses to produce and market fluorescent fish within the United States. The production of fluorescent fish by any other party, or the sale of any fluorescent fish not originally distributed by 5-D Tropical or Segrest Farms, is strictly prohibited. For additional information regarding GloFish® fluorescent fish license details please click here.""  I went through all their pictures also. The only ones displaying the colored Black Skirt Tetras showed them *entirely green.* Not just a solid stripe down the fishes back. Plus, why are these fish (the tetras is all I'm referring to, not the actual Glo-Fish themselves.) sold as Mixed Fruit Tetras then instead of Glo-Fish Tetras? Which still leads me to believe that *this particular fish* is still an artificially dyed version. To include the ones I own. I HAVE some of these fish! I know what they look like. :)  The entire site is actually really interesting, and I'm glad you linked it. But I'm still going to say that these are dyed, as they don't look similar enough to the ones manufactured by Glo-Fish to be genetic. Or if my fish spawn, I guess their babies will actually tell me what's what. In all fair honesty, I only brought up their dyedness in the first place to warn OP that that's what was actually purchased. That's all. Really. &gt;&lt;",®

t5_2snuc,lanemik,1345232833,"&gt;Don't tell the particle physicists! They need to keep their funding!  Particle physics has nothing to say about this because none of them posit a universe (or particles) that is actually without cause. All quantum mechanics is contingent upon the existence of the relativistic quantum field which itself is contingent (upon what nobody knows).  &gt;Our best model of the universe so far, drawing on quantum mechanics, indicates that reality is probabilistic.  And yet, still contingent and these probabilities are grounded upon physical stuff. Honestly, the more I see it done the more I think that appealing to QM is the new god of the gaps. Quantum uncertainty of the gaps. ""Do you have a problem with a stupid philosopher poking holes in your naturalism? Just use Quantum Spackle®!""  &gt; Things can happen not because they were caused to happen, or because they necessarily happened, but because they could happen.  They can only happen because of a cause, the relativistic quantum field which itself is contingent. As David Albert (Ph.D. in theoretical physics) puts it:   &gt;The fact that some arrangements of fields happen to correspond to the existence of particles and some don’t is not a whit more mysterious than the fact that some of the possible arrangements of my fingers happen to correspond to the existence of a fist and some don’t. And the fact that particles can pop in and out of existence, over time, as those fields rearrange themselves, is not a whit more mysterious than the fact that fists can pop in and out of existence, over time, as my fingers rearrange themselves. And none of these poppings — if you look at them aright — amount to anything even remotely in the neighborhood of a creation from nothing.  ...  &gt;Now, I can't blame Kant for not knowing quantum mechanics in the 1700s. But what we've observed wins. The things that we observe on a day-to-day basis, the objects and events at our middle-world scale, are indeed either caused by something or necessary. But that's not the only scale there is in the universe.  Can I blame *you* for not knowing QM? How about philosophy?",®

I suspect you got a cheap 10m HDMI cable no?    &gt;720p/1080i Resolution - The Standard HDMI® Cable has sufficient bandwidth to transfer 720p/1080i video signals between 720p/1080i rated source and sink (display) devices.  Note that this tends to indicate that it MIGHT work with 1080p. If you're outputting 120hz that's even more data than 1080p. HDMI data is uncompressed and frankly with a cheap cable the high frequency performance is going to suffer. Do I need to explain that sending 1920 × 1080 at 120 fps is going to inherently be a pretty high frequency operation that will suffer with long cables?  The easiest thing to do to test if the cable is just not cutting it is to move your computer near the receiver and use a much shorter cable and see if you experience the same behavior or if it works properly. If so I would look into getting a cable certified for high speed hdmi certification at that length. They have some on mono-price... if it still doesn't work I am opposed to recommending some super expensive hdmi cables ;/  Is this really an audiophile question? ;/ whatever.

I can't remember off hand what exactly is in it, but I know I did my research when I bought them years back, and as I scientist, I remember noting that they were non-toxic and all the ingredients were safe for consumption and add no off flavors of their own.  From Brita site: ""In a Brita® Faucet filter, there is a two-step process. When you turn on your tap, water first passes through a non-woven screen around the filter to trap sediment. Then, the water then flows through a compressed block of carbon and zeolite, reducing chlorine (for taste and odor) and lead""  So yeah, it is definitely worth noting that the Brita will not remove chloramine, if you use water above the threshold of detection.",®

Show him:  *** g 12/10 pp. 22-23 How Can I Explain the Bible’s View of Homosexuality? *** If someone asks: “What’s your view of homosexuality?” You might reply: “I don’t hate homosexuals, but I can’t approve of their conduct.”  ✔ Remember: If you’re guided by the Bible’s moral code, then that is your lifestyle choice, and you have a right to it. (Joshua 24:15) Don’t feel ashamed of your view.—Psalm 119:46. Shouldn’t Christians treat all people with respect, regardless of their sexual orientation? Absolutely. The Bible says: “Honor men of all sorts” or, as Today’s English Version renders it, “Respect everyone.” (1 Peter 2:17) Therefore, Christians are not homophobic. They show kindness to all people, including those who are gay.—Matthew 7:12. If someone asks: “Doesn’t your view of homosexuality encourage prejudice against gays?” You might reply: “Not at all. I reject homosexual conduct, not people.”  ✔ You could add: “To illustrate it, I also choose not to smoke. In fact, I find the very idea of it repugnant. But suppose you’re a smoker and you feel differently. I wouldn’t be prejudiced against you for your view, just as I’m sure you wouldn’t be prejudiced against me for my view—am I right? The same principle applies to our differing views of homosexuality.”  It's good that the WTS has at least changed their view on this a bit.  Tell him he she accept the WTS' new light on this matter instead of relying on his own prejudices. =)",✔

It's not NIV is evil or opposite, but simplified so much as to obscure (from my view, at least) some important shades of meaning. Here's an example I ran into yesterday:  King James Bible (Cambridge Ed.) For he performeth the thing that is appointed for me: and many such things are with him.  Young's Literal Translation For He doth complete my portion, And many such things are with Him.  New International Version (©1984) He carries out his decree against me, and many such plans he still has in store.  (note that NASB, ESV, etc. are all similar to KJV. NLT is different. But ""carries out his decree against me?"" here's a link with a bunch of translations if you're curious: http://bible.cc/job/23-14.htm)  Here's another one that irks me: ""no variableness nor shadow of turning"" (KJV, etc.) vs. ""does not change like shifting shadows"" (NIV). (http://bible.cc/james/1-17.htm)  These aren't the only, nor the best examples, just recent ones. Does my shades of meaning point make sense? I don't mean that you can't grow by reading NIV (my first Bible was NIV: my main Scripture source for ~4 yrs) or that I would not respect an NIV-reader or anything, just that i don't read it myself and wouldn't recommend it if someone were shopping.

Find a case where a black person did something just as bad as what they are pointing out.**  **[✔]“You are the racist one” - turn the tables.**  **[✔]“I am offended” – how dare they call you a racist! You do not see a person’s colour – they could be purple for all you care!**  **[✔]Arab trader argument – whites are not as evil as black people like to think. For example, it was not just white people who traded slaves: Arabs did it too! Few blacks know that, so make sure to point that out whenever you can.**  **[✔]“But that happened to me too!” – whatever blacks complain about, try to find a case where a white person – you, a friend, someone in the news -  experienced the same thing.**  **[✔]Point out how “ghetto” and disagreeable black people are – because they are and it needs pointing out. No wonder no one gets along with them!**  **[✔]Talk down to them – they are imagining things, they do not know what they are talking about. How dare blacks tell us what we are like. What do they know? Are they white?**  **[✔]straw man – argue against some stock position that is kind of like the post. That way you can copy your comments from another blog. Or from Ann Coulter.**  **[✔]Blacks need to be colour-blind – if they just stopped seeing race and talking about it so much then racism would go away!**  **[✔]Start quoting rape statistics – out of the blue, if necessary. Rates of imprisonment are good too.**  **[✔]The white inventor argument – whites invented everything so shut up already.**  **[✔]Demand proof – Make them prove it beyond a reasonable doubt with facts and figures. Find holes in whatever facts they present. Find counter-facts.**  **[✔]Make it about the past - and point out that your family never owned slaves. When are they going to stop living in the past?**  **[✔]Go back to Africa – if it is so bad here, then go back to Africa already!**  **[✔]Bootstrap – I made it on my own without help from anyone.  Blacks expect something for nothing!**  **[✔]Some of my best friends are black – so there is no way I am racist!**  **[✔]Might makes right – all through history.**  [Source](http://abagond.wordpress.com/2009/10/05/how-to-argue-like-a-white-racist/)  ***  Holy fuck this one is a near blackout... no mention of the Arab slavers though...

t5_2qhh7,rmc,1345326308,"Yes I have to agree here. Ireland is not as bad as you appear to make out.  There are several things to remember about Ireland &amp; modern Irish people, especially if you're in the USA and are aware of Irish-Americans.   * Irish-Americans (AFAIK) are quite old fashioned, and more staunchly catholic, and anti-LGBT, than Irish people. Some of the rules for the New York Paddy's Day parade are cringeworthy to Irish people (""England out of Ireland""?!?! WTF? Here we have local migrant groups marching in our Paddy's Day parades)  * Ireland has changed a lot in a generation. Literally. There has been a massive social change in the last 20 → 30 years. So yes there was a referendum to legalise divorce in Ireland, in 1996, and it passed by ~ 50.3%. However now that issue would not be controversial at all. A Taoiseach (like Prime Minister), Bertie Ahern, was separated from his wife and lived with his long time partner. No-one complained about his family values.  * Lots of people in Ireland are ""ethnically Catholic"", and will mark ""Catholic"" on the census forms. This is because for a while ""Catholic = Irish, not-catholic = english"". There were recent survies of Catholics in Ireland (not just Irish people, Catholic Irish people), and the majority (~60+% do not agree with the Church on sexuality).  * Yes abortion is illegal in Ireland, however the UK, where abortion is legal, is a 1 hour plane journey away. This ""half solution"" is good enough for most people to not want to shake things up too much. It is explicitly legal to travel abroad for an abortion and to hear about getting an abortion abroad, no censorship nor ""police at the border"" situation here. Abortion is probably easier to get in Ireland than some parts of USA.  Some examples of Ireland being progressive w.r.t. LGBT equality (rather than anecdotes):   * Last Irish presidential election (last year), we had an only gay, and long time LGBT activist (David Norris), run for president. He (along with 2 previous presidents) is responsible for legalising homosexuality here. He got ~ 6.2% of the first preference votes (☹).  * Of the 7 presidential candidates, only 2 were not in favour of marriage equality, and they got a combined total of only 5.6% of the votes. That means 94% of the population voted for canidates who supported marriage equality.  * Here's a video of the now president (then TD (like congressperson)) calling for marriage equality, 5 years ago. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9cSSH6imyM  * There are sevaral openly LGB people in the parliament.  * It is illegal in Ireland to discriminate based on sexual orientation, or gender identity. A trans person was fired from their job for wanting to transition, and successfully sued them. The government is introducing laws to allow trans people to change their birth certs (but it dragging their heels).  Ireland isn't perfect, but it is incorrect to say ""Ireland is the US, but 50 years back in the past"". Ireland is a modern, liberal country. ",☹

t5_2rlnw,ForeverAFeminist,1345330398,"&gt;What you posted is, instead, a reason that a man would want to post in SRSwomen.  Except that /r/SRSMen is NOT a place merely for men. It's a place for pro-feminist men, who are in fact a minority on this website. Meanwhile, feminist women are a minority within a minority. Hence why /r/SRSWomen needs to have a policy of banning men in order for women to speak without getting drowned out by men. It's a safe space for women.  &gt;So your argument is that SRSMen is about men's issues, and that's all the discussion a man would need?   Men are free to contribute at /r/SRSDiscussion and /r/SRSFeminism.  &gt;If men have on place for discussing women's issues, why would women need places for discussing men's issues?  Men AND women are welcome at /r/SRSMen. Ideally, we would have a userbase at /r/SRSMen that is 45% male 45% female 10% different identity, but we don't. Instead, as expected on a website dominated by men, we have it skew towards men being the dominant voice. In order to **compensate** for this skewing, we allow women to comment in /r/SRSMen, and we don't let men comment in /r/SRSWomen.  It's a basic matrix as far as how welcome the different genders are presented in each subreddit:   | | | | :--|:--|:-- &amp;nbsp; | Women | Men SRSWomen | ✔ | **X** SRSMen | ✔ | ✔  This is to compensate for the rest of Reddit, which basically looks like this:  | | | | :--|:--|:-- &amp;nbsp; | Women | Men All | **X** | ✔ [2xc](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes) | ✔ | ✔  Your username identifies you as a feminist, so do you also support affirmative action, or no?

Honestly, in a perfect world anyone on the administration side of the server wouldn't be allowed to play the game, in the same manner as devs of Eve online or WoW aren't allowed to actively participate due to advantages inferred by just being a passing part of the development process, let alone writing plugins themselves.

The only motivation to produce programming content for the server is to better the experience for yourself. These people aren't being paid, they're volunteers; nobody wants to help manage and moderate a server like this for nothing. Over time, as Civcraft grows, reliance on these player-administrators should falter, but until then if we disallow administrators from actively partaking in server activities, we wouldn't have any administrators, and the entire server would suffer for it.

t5_2qpp6,SadCritters,1345420754,"...They WERE doing this well.  And you're a complete moron for trying to argue that in THIS thread specifically---Where the OP admitted they counted ALL THE ZvZ'S as wins.  Zergs were doing well way before the patch. You should probably go look at some of the scales from before it. ( Which entirely support what I am saying. )  The Ghost nerf is when Terrans started losing to Zergs. ( Because Terrans were no longer able to rely on Snipe to kill every Zerg unit. )  The only thing I am angry about is how stupid you are---Which is very frustrating because you feel that your opinion is a considered ""Fact"" versus what has actually happened.   I already pointed out that you're using logical fallacies to try and get your point across. I already pointed out when Zergs started winning most of their games versus Terran.  All you keep doing is restating your argument of ""Herpderp Queens and Overlords. Herpderp that patch made Zergs win."" as though someone's going to actually accept your opinion versus facts; when in fact Terrans are still reeling from the previous patch---Not the one you are pointing out.  You're arguing actual facts with your opinion.   I'd probably go back to school, if I were you.  You also entirely dodged the fact that I pointed out the Infestor Nerf. Zergs were still winning after that nerf---According to your horri-bad logic, that means that the nerf actually made Zergs STRONGER because Zerg win-rates continued to climb.   TL;DR: Stay in school son. I don't want to have to support you with my tax dollars.  ♥",♥

t5_2qhff,viborg,1345435248,"I don't know if the mechanism is fully understood, but it does seem the effectiveness of the herb I had in mind, Astragalus or Huang Qi, has not been fully demonstrated. Here's some info from [Wikipedia:](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astragalus#Research)  &gt;Research  &gt;The biotechnology firms Geron Corporation and TA Therapeutics of Hong Kong have been working on deriving a telomerase activator from it. The chemical constituent cycloastragenol (also called TAT2) is being studied to help combat HIV, as well as infections associated with chronic diseases or aging. However, the National Institutes of Health states: ""The evidence for using astragalus for any health condition is limited. High-quality clinical trials (studies in people) are generally lacking. There is some preliminary evidence to suggest that astragalus, either alone or in combination with other herbs, may have potential benefits for the immune system, heart, and liver, and as an adjunctive therapy for cancer"".  &gt;A study published in the 15 November 2008 Journal of Immunology, researchers shed light on the antiviral and antiaging benefits of Astragalus. In their paper, a team of researchers from the UCLA AIDS Institute described how their work with cycloastragenol reduces the aging process of immune cells, and enhances how these cells respond to viral infections. The compound works by boosting production of telomerase, an enzyme that allows for the replacement of short bits of DNA, known as telomeres, that play a key role in cell replication, cancer and human aging.  [More evidence in favor:](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pat.357/abstract)   &gt;Abstract   Sulfated astragalus polysaccharide (sulfated astragalan, SA) was prepared by chemical modification of astragalus polysaccharide abstracted from an astragalus menbranceus used as a Mongolia herbal medicine. Anti-HIV activity of SA was assayed in vitro and the results indicated that the SA showing high anti-HIV activity and lower cytotoxity. Sulfation of astragalan was carried out by using sulfur trioxide-pyridine complex in a mixture of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) to give sulfated astragalan with degree of substitution (DS) of 1.14–1.20 and a number average molecular weight (Mn) of 1.27–1.46 × 104. Copyright © 2003 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.  [And most recently](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22083896) (although this is published in Planta Medica, I don't know what kind of journal it is):  &gt;Abstract   Two Chinese herb-derived small molecule telomerase activators, astragaloside IV (AG-IV) and cycloastragenol (CAG), have recently been shown to improve the proliferative response of CD8+ T lymphocytes from HIV-infected patients by upregulating telomerase activity. Here, we examined the signaling mechanism of AG-IV and CAG. Telomerase activity in human embryonic kidney HEK293 fibroblasts was increased upon treatment with increasing concentrations of AG-IV or CAG. Both compounds induced the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) in a time- and dose-dependent manner in HEK293 cells and HEK-neo keratinocytes. AG-IV and CAG also stimulated ERK phosphorylation in other cell lines of lung, brain, mammary, endothelial, and hematopoietic origins. Use of selective inhibitors and dominant negative mutants revealed the involvement of c-Src, MEK (ERK kinase), and epidermal growth factor receptor in CAG-induced ERK phosphorylation. Our data indicate that AG-IV and CAG may exert their cellular effects through the activation of the Src/MEK/ERK pathway.",©

t5_2qh61,SavageHenry0311,1345444088,"If anyone's interested in what Pilar means, here's a little medicolegal word-vomit.  There are three types of consent in medicine:  Expressed consent - The patient states, either verbally or in writing that it's okay to do something.  I say,""The doc thinks you'll feel better after some IV fluids.  To do that, I need to poke you in the arm with this huge rusty needle.  You ready for some pain, bud?""  When the patient says,""Do your worst, Henry.  You're a fucking punk and you're gonna miss the first three sticks anyway.  Might as well get this line started while we're both still young,"" that's expressed consent.  Informed consent - The patient has a clear understanding of the act, it's intents, consequences, and ramifications.  This is usually done in writing.  When you go in for a scheduled surgery, for example, you sign a whole bunch of paperwork stating what you're getting done, what could go wrong, that it might not work, etc.    I use informed consent a lot as an EMS type.  It's actually illegal for me to take a person who is of sound mind to the hospital against their will.  If that person refuses transport, I'm supposed to get them to sign a form that says basically ""If you don't go with ol' Henry here, you might die.  That's not his fault.""  Note the ""of sound mind"" part.  I transport people against their will all the time.  Once, I took this dude from an Occupy Wall Street demonstration.  He'd been huffing computer cleaner all day, and had two empty Xanax bottles that had been filled within a few days.  He was stumbling, had apparently urinated on himself, and was not oriented to time, date, location, or events.  The whole way to the ED he lectured me in semi-coherent, slurring words about how I was a corporate shill profiting from denying working people their basic human rights.  The words ""You'll be hearing from my attorney,"" and ""you fucking scumbag kidnapping corporate thug"" were mentioned.  I'm not a kidnapper (the rest is open to interpretation) because it was impossible for him to give informed consent to a refusal of treatment/transport.  He was gorked out of his mind.  Which leads us to....   Implied consent - The patient implies consent by their actions.  If you show up to your doc's office for another yearly physical, it's understood that you aren't going to hire a lawyer to go after the nurse that took your blood pressure because she put a BP cuff around your arm.  You knew that would happen, and you showed up anyway...  If you've just had a grotesque and improbable blender accident, and cannot sign legal forms due to the blood spurting from the stumps where your hands used to be, that's okay.  A reasonable person in their right mind would want some help.  The hairy palm floating in your smoothie and the arterial blood arcing through the air are a hint to me, your friendly ambalamps driver, that you want to go to the ED.  Just because the answer to every question I ask is ""Fuck the Vita-Mix Automatic Mix'n Machine® and all five pre-programmed settings,"" doesn't mean you're going to die.  ",®

Hold the mash at 154 °F (68 °C) until enzymatic conversion is complete. Infuse the mash with near boiling water while stirring or with a recirculating mash system raise the temperature to mash out at 168°F (76°C). Sparge slowly with 170 °F (77 °C) water, collecting wort until the pre-boil kettle volume is around 5.9 gallons (22.3 L) and the gravity is 1.053 (13.2 °P).      The total wort boil time is 60 minutes. Add the first hop addition once the wort starts boiling. Add Irish moss or other kettle finings and the second hop addition with 15 minutes left in the boil. Add the last hop addition at flame out. Chill the wort to 67 °F (19 °C) and aerate thoroughly. The proper pitch rate is 2 packages of liquid yeast or 1 package of liquid yeast in a 2.4-liter starter.      Ferment at 67 °F (19 °C) until the yeast drops clear. At this temperature and with healthy yeast, fermentation should be complete in about one week. Allow the lees to settle and the brew to mature without pressure for another two days after fermentation appears finished. Rack to a keg and force carbonate or rack to a bottling bucket, add priming sugar, and bottle. Target a carbonation level of 2.5 volumes.",®

t5_2qhon,Werepez,1345497488,"This comment made me grin since I'm *such* a huge fan of A Comic Shop. I was a frequent customer until I moved to Sarasota, and even then I always be sure to stop by when I visit. (Pandel was one of my best friends for years, too, the place will never be the same without him. ♥) I used to work at Bad Apple Comics when it was around, and, while our actual stock lacked more often than not (thanks to circumstances outside of our control), I was always inspired by A Comic Shop to give the best customer service that I could. Now I work at a comic book store in Sarasota and I'll still talk fondly of ACS. :))  There's a likelihood we've met and I'm afraid I'm going to sound silly for saying all this, but regardless, so many kudos for this comment! Customer service should always be the #1 goal of *any* retail-driven store, comic books are no exception.",♥

First off, at our store, we would hand out free dog treats at the drive thru when people had pets in their cars with them. Guy in the back window takes an order, hollers up to the idiot working the front window that this certain car needs treats. Idiot at the front window goes up to the wrong car (this car was full of teenage girls), gives them a handful of treats, and says ""I hear there's some dogs in the car..."" They were not pleased.  During our downtime at the store, we would get some of the wilder girls to do some more adult themed dares. Luckily our manager was a 20 year old male, so he would allow it and encourage it. On one such occasion, a bunch of us were in the back breakroom daring two gals to get crazy. No sooner than the fun had started, the back window drive thru worker interrupts us, walking in and saying ""Hey guys, back to work, I've got an order."" to which my manager responds, ""I have two chicks back here licking McFlurries® off each others tits. It can fucking wait."" The look on the back drive thru employees face instantly told us all that his auto-mic had picked up my managers voice and broadcast it to the customers in their vehicle. Luckily they were college aged guys that thought it even funnier than we did. Their McFlurries were on the house.",®

The difference between Ron Paul and Obama is, Ron Paul's ""wishes"" didn't terrify me. Obama was a naïve politician (I think) who had no clue that none of the shit he wanted to do would be possible or even beneficial (to him at least). He never pushed for draconian abortion laws, or any such Stone Age law.   As for the funding of Obamacare, that's all economics stuff that I can't be bothered to learn, because math is hard and I'd rather have someone else do it. I can, however, use Google, and see that it'd be paid for in taxes (if my reading comprehension isn't as shitty as it is sometimes): http://www.businessinsider.com/here-are-the-new-obamacare-taxes-2012-7  As for the war on terror, Obama is winding it down immensely, as far as I've seen on the news. At least in terms of manpower, Obama has had the military all but withdraw entirely from Iraq, and moved a few thousand into Afghanistan. I'm not a pro-war person by any means, but I'm also not a big fan of ""it'd be really hard to do, let's not do it."" Since Obama was sworn in, the buildup of forces in Afghanistan (Happiest Place on Earth^® since 1990) has led to the deaths of Al-Qaeda's top 3 leaders. Ended the movement entirely, no. Crippled it, yes. It's no longer at the point where they can fling planes at us, but if we were to leave now, any progress made would be even more pointless. They're not Nazis, where killing the head causes the rest to shrivel and flake away. It's more like a Hydra.   I guess my point is ""devil I know."" I'd rather have the at least semi-sane, reasonable-seeming Obama in office then the ""abortion is never to protect the mother's health"" Paul. ",®

The Forward is a points card that redeems at one point = 5/8ths of a cent (.625 cents, $.00625).   &gt;5 ThankYou® Points for every $1 you spend at restaurants and on entertainment;1 point per $1 on all other purchases.  Which makes it 5 * .00625 = 3.125% for restaurants &amp; entertainment. Entertainment includes bookstores. Bookstores include Amazon. Entertainment includes record stores, movie theaters, etc... but it's a sub 1% card for everything else.  On the Dividend, when the categories are active (IF YOU OPT INTO THEM - you must do so to get the 5% cashback in rotating categories), you can earn up to $300 a year in bonus cashback  &gt;Unless the offer you received indicates otherwise, you may accumulate a maximum of 300 Dividend Dollars in any calendar year (eligible transactions appearing on your January - December billing statements) payable in checks of $50 increments only upon your request . Dividend Dollars earned on purchases through the Citi Bonus Cash Center are not subject to the $300 calendar year maximum accumulation.  In order to get $300 cashback, you would need to spend $6,000 in the 5% categories.

The Organic Bumper Bed® is made with a removable organic cotton cover, helping our Earth by reducing the amount of chemicals we put into the ground. The cushion used on the inside of the donut dog bed is made from 100% recycled IntelliLoft®, which was previously plastic soda bottles. Since it takes less energy to clean and recycle plastic bottles than it does to make new plastic, you are not only helping keep plastic from going to landfills, but lowering the carbon footprint too.   Most dog beds are made of cheap, mass produced synthetic materials that are extremely harmful to animals. There have been studies done on the chemical levels of animal beds. They first started in [2008](http://www.ewg.org/reports/pets) and the public knowing has grown greatly over the years. [Triclosan](http://thebark.com/content/toxic-chemical-found-dog-beds-and-toys) has been found in a broad range of consumer products. This chemical has been known to cause insulin regulation and hinder brain function.   Overall, I believe if you love your pets as much as you love your kids you should always provide them with the best products possible. It may be a few bucks more but it totally worth every penny.

I won't really comment on that because of the small number of effective cannon rushes that have been performed against Terrans.  Zerg is a different matter. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise, but so long as you aren't building seven cannons---You usually come out really, really far ahead if you caused the Zerg to either cancel their Hatchery or out-right lose it. 'So long as you play safe and expand you will be fine. Just make sure to build defenses and prepare for an all in or nydus or something weird.   I'm a Master's Zerg and I can openly say that trying to come back from a lost Hatchery is near-impossible if you went Forge First when it comes to your first Hatchery being put down. ( Especially since this implies that your Spawning Pool is delayed and you can't really immediately send a proper counter-attack....Especially with the size of maps now. ) You can, however, recover from a cancelled hatchery. The Zerg should place a new hatchery at their third, after your cannon's are about to finish at his natural. It's still difficult, as your bases are spread out and you need to make units to take your Natural---But not that awful..  If you destroy the Hatchery while doing a cannon rush at the natural---Your friend is right. You are generally the winner, you are extremely far ahead, and so long as you didn't make 5+ cannons, you will stay ahead.   'Another important aspect is when to realize you are not going to be able to cannon rush and stopping making cannons. Sometimes, it's just enough damage to cause the Zerg to pull a ton of Drones and go back to your normal Fast-Expand plan.   ♥  ",♥

One supply, no barracks. For a while, seeing something like this made me slow down my game, thinking ""my opponent is not very good. I'm way ahead"". Until I got caught off-guard by too many cheeses (proxy rax and so on). This time I did not want to make the same mistake. My game went into overdrive. I checked for proxy locations, went into full-defense mode. No proxies to be found... anywhere. I re-scout the base. Still no wall-off, 2 marines, 2 marauders, to my 20ish supply army, including one colossus (yes I built it before re-scouting, silly me).  At that point I had a fairly good idea what was going on: I was playing against someone new to the game, and I felt really bad. I did not want to make him lose interest in the game. My though process: ""Finish the game, and offer a few coaching games after"". So I attacked. He quit the game much faster than anticipated :(  The next thing I did was open a chat to discuss the game, only to find out that he blocked me. Probably because he just allows chats from friends. Out of desperation, I tried to contact him again a few times, but he logged off soon after.  I felt really bad then, and left the game as well. I was disappointed in myself :'( I was not able to give my opponent a ""good game"". Yes, I could have just parked my army outside his base, and start the chat. Which I now do if this situation comes up. But I didn't at that time. I still feel very bad now, thinking about it. If he'd accepted the chat, I am sure we could have had a couple of fun games...  ♥  *edit*: formatting ",♥

t5_2qmg3,Angry_Caveman_Lawyer,1345740999,"I decided to rustle some jimmies this week:  **49ers**  You guys have a turd for a QB and your running back situation makes me LOL.  **Bears** If you can't protect Cutler this year I'ma fly my ass to Chicago and bust some caps in some O-line asses.  &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;  **Bengals** I was going to trash talk your team but I just don't care enough about them to do so.  **Bills** You add one good player and all the sudden you're gonna win the division? LOLDon't think so.  **Broncos**  You're one bad snap away from Caleb ""Fuck he's horrible"" Hanie.  Remember that, and be afraid.  Be very very afraid.  And then pissed off at your front office for making him the second string QB.  **Browns**  Nothing I can say is as bad as what you would say yourselves, so I won't.  **Buccaneers**  Josh Freeman looks like Morgan Freeman's retarded pot smoking grandson.  **Cardinals**  Here, a poem:  Roses are Red  So are Cardinals  Larry Fitzgerald  Languishes on this fucking team because you can't figure out that a good QB is a requirement and fuck you guys for that because LF is a good man and a damned good receiver and it sucks that he's stuck on this perennial shitheel of a team  **Chargers**  Phil Rivers will be making that ""Someone just farted and I don't know if I like the smell or hate it"" face all damned season.  LOLNorv.  **Chiefs**  I actually like the Chiefs this year, which means you'll find a way to fuck it all up again, just like you have every year since 19 fucking 50.  **Colts** In week 1, Andrew Luck is gonna get the ever loving shit beat out of him by the Bears.  Welcome to the league, Rook.  Fuck you.  **Cowboys**  I would say something bad about the Cowboys here, but why bother?  They're going nowhere again this year, just like every year since the new millennium started.  **Dolphins**  Thanks for letting us trade rape you!  ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥   **Eagles**  DREAMTEAM DREAMTEAM DREAMTEAM....for the fans, it's a fucking nightmare, not a ""dream"".  Mike Vick is more fragile than a 13 year old girl's ego at a summer camp for the socially inept.  **Falcons**  Everyone thinks this is the year Matt Ryan ""breaks out"".  I think he'll shit himself like a bum black-out drunk on Schlitz Malt Liquor.  The ""ceiling"" for this guy is about 2 feet above his head.  **Giants**  Fuck you guys for only playing for part of a season, squeaking into the playoffs and then deciding to kick ass.  You're making the rest of the league look bad.  **Jaguars**  MJD is turning into a little bitch before our very eyes.  It's a shame, I actually have mad respect for his skills on the field.  Too bad he doesn't honor contracts.  **Jets**  How the fuck does this work?  You guys haven't won shit since Namath was actually cool, and yet the media swallows your load like a hungry porn star.  I don't get it.  STFU until you win something, dickbags.  **Lions**  In my 30-some odd years of watching football, I've seen the Lions put together back to back winning seasons...Once.  And no, Lions fans, an 8-8 season isn't a ""winning"" season.  What am I getting at?  7-9, here you come.  **Packers** Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Great offense you got there.  Shame if something were to happen to it.  BTW, your defense is more porous than something that is completely and totally porous.  It's funny, when the DC gets together to pump up the team, his war cry is ""Jesus Christ, please just stop them once, you sorry bags of useless shit"".  **Panthers**  Cammy Cam gonna need all the ~~lube~~juice he can get this year, teams gonna rape him.  AKA ""sophomore slump"".  **Patriots**  I swear to Christ this team actually pisses me off.  If you fucktards could actually pay attention *just a little bit* to defense you'd be so goddamned good.  Instead, we get weepy Kraft sitting in his box staring at heaven.  Nice, dickholes, thanks for the imagery there.  **Raiders**  I got nothing bad to say about you guys, you gave us Campbell *and* Michael Bush.  So thanks for that, and uh...good chat.  **Rams**  Christ, has it really been 2 decades since the greatest show on turf?  Seems like now it's the greatest shitshow on turf.  You guys should be ashamed that Steven Jackson is literally killing himself for your shitty team.  **Ravens**  Caw caw, mother fucker.  A couple years ago, the Bears came into town and your team beat the shit out of the Bears by a bunch.  I sat next to the visiting team's owners box and Michael McCaskey himself said ""sorry, we'll get 'em next time"" to me as he was leaving.  I didn't say shit back, it was a God awful loss.  So fuck you guys for that, k?    **Redskins**  OK, so this one might get a little personal here, and I apologize for that to my Redskin fan homeys on this board.  That said, here we go:  STFU you stupid ignorant Redskins fans.  Your team hasn't shown shit since the fucking 90s, why are you CONSTANTLY thinking your team is so damned good?  Every year, the morons I live around get all geeked up about the ""12 and 4"" season they're about to have.  Motherfucker, you haven't gone 12-4 or better since Bush 1 was in office.  STOP IT, you make yourself look bad, frigging idiots.  **Saints**  Ain't none of us give a single flying fuck about that bounty scandal shit, Jonathan fucking Vilma, or your head coach.  ***WE DON'T CARE***.  Ok?  **Seahawks** God I can't wait until my team plays yours this year.  It's so fucking ON.  I'm starting to develop a dislike of your team, based off the cockiness of your fans.  Fucking sea chickens.  Like a damned yard bird except on water.  **Steelers**  Old and slow.  Just like our defense.  Except maybe not.  We'll see.  I got nothing for you guys, except I hate how you're consistently good.  Fuck you guys.  **Texans**  One good season, boys.  Just 1.  Let's not get all crazy here.  A history of 8-8 indicates mediocrity.  If you do it again this year, I will LOL so fucking hard.  **Titans** I'm gonna draft Chris Johnson this year.  If he sucks, I will personally drive down to TN, find each and every one of you Titans fans on reddit and kick you square in the nuts for leading me to believe he could be good again.  So for your sake, and your ball's sake, I hope he does well.  I'm itching to kick some shit this year.  **Vikings**  Fuck your team for *almost* making me feel sorry for it.  Christ, what happened to you guys?  You're like the Charlie Brown of the NFL.  That's not a compliment, folks.  ",♥

t5_2qh6c,aim2free,1345810636,"Thanks for your comment ❣ I been away from internet for a while, vacaction and such. I would say that you have grasped the problem in a very similar way as I have but how to interpret things is a highly ambigous problem.  This is correct, when you say:  &gt; humanity's best interests *while living on Earth*  This is, however, somewhat more troublesome:   &gt; Furthermore, it seems that your perfect end goal is on Earth (it would seem).   My perfect end goal is a world without suffering and without unnecessary limitations where all people are good, and... where I can fly :-)  The big question is: Why are we here?  I feel that this world is too full of struggle and annoyances. Too much crazyness and selfishness and obscessions with different things where people are abused, stupid, violent and so on.  This is an unacceptable state for any world. This is the reason it has to be fixed, but I also consider the world so crazy that the most likely is that we are not meant to stay here. This is one reason why I'm not too positive to life extension technologies, as they can basically just make you stay longer in a kind of prison...  Anyway, I consider Love being the fundamental force. With Love everywhere in every mind and heart there doesn't need to be suffering.  My goal is to make this world a world full of Love. This doesn't imply that this world is where we should stay, but it could be the key to reach our ""heaven"".  One can just speculate, but my idea is that the world as we see it now is like a fence. When we have learned to live in this world, then the fence may be taken away and the real world in full glory appear.  I had actually a revelation in 1987, a visual one, in the evening, it lasted about 3 minutes under heavy convulsions and cold sweat. What I saw as a 2x2m picture flooding with light on my wall was the front page of this book, which was released by Keith Curtis a couple of years ago [After the Software Wars](http://keithcu.com/wordpress/?page_id=407). From 1987-2009 I hadn't understood what I had seen more than it was very positive and warm and I felt it was Love behind. I had seen what looked like a kind of portal on the left and that it looked like a wonderful city and people. When I saw the book 22 years later I immediately recognized it, and immediately understood the message.  What is the main problem with this world from my perspective is that we do not share our love and what is shareable to benefit all, and we also use technology in a way which is absurd, as we use technology to a large extent to control and supervise people, instead of helping and assisting people. As in the old dystopic visionary movie [Metropolis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolis_%28film%29) from 1927 by Fritz Lang. I asked Keith Curtis where the picture on the front page came from, and he told me that it was part of a larger work [Metriopolis 2208](http://thmc.deviantart.com/art/Metropolis-2208-75669429) by Niels Seifert, which was cool as I often used to refer to that movie :-)  This all made sense! After having seen that revelation in 1987 I immedietely became a believer and decided to do something about the world. I wrote a report (to finish a course) which was a vision about the technological and social development on Earth from 1987 to 2037, which I denoted ""TankeNyckeln"" (it's Swedish and could be interpreted as ""Mind Key"" or ""Mind Wrench"" (would with today's naming be a Tablet). My report was lost a few years but a friend had a copy and scanned it for me. I have put it [here for now](http://www.scribd.com/doc/94021562/TankeNyckeln), but I intend to translate it to English and a few other languages.   The predictions during these 25 years have been highly accurate. Even the fact that [ARM processor](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/epic/arm/8243162/History-of-ARM-from-Acorn-to-Apple.html) now is the one being encouraged by the big ones :-) The ARM, which was released 1987 and I proposed as the basis for the TankeNyckeln is now even [used for brain simulations](http://www.eetimes.com/electronics-news/4217840/Million-ARM-cores-brain-simulator) and already in most smartphones and tablets.  The last pages about 2037 describes a world without suffering, without wars, violence, crimes, abuse and starvation. A world full of Love and collaboration.  As I consider the big contemporary prophets to be [Richard Stallman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman) and [Richard Falkvinge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Falkvinge), I made [this somewhat jokular picture](http://bloggar.computersweden.idg.se/hardcoreopensource/files/2011/04/Metropolis.png) with Stallman (which sounds like Superman in Swedish) to the left, me in the middle and Falkvinge to the right in April 2011.  Basically what Jesus said was to share your love and your things, which he illustrated well with the fishes and the breads. This is exactly what Stallman says [about software](http://www.gnu.org/music/free-software-song.en.html) and Falkvinge about [knowledge, information and culture](http://falkvinge.net/2012/06/02/the-game-of-acta-mid-battle-analysis-next-actions/). For my own has been a patent abolishonist the last 12 years, but got very happy  when the Pirate party was funded in late 2005, to support my visions about a free world.  To generalize the concept of software freedom to immaterial as well as material freedom I have forked the general public license into [Generic Pitchfork Licence](http://wish-it.se/gpl) suitable for an arbitrarily advanced technology (as exemplified by the fishes and the bread by Jesus).",❣

Why would this be? First, the largest sex organ we possess is the brain, so if you are smart, the sexual fantasies you have will be much richer, detailed and kinkier than the rest. Secondly, if you are in a position of control or high stress and are dominant throughout the workday, taking a break from also being sexually dominant is necessary for balance.

If you are taking classes that can be considered pharmacy related those can count (I used some that way).  Also if you belong to your state pharmacy association they often have continuing education credits you can earn by attending their meetings.  Other ways include drug rep talks where they often serve you dinner and you learn.  As long as they along technicians to attend and give you CE credit through technician specific questions you can use those and usually are free.  Hopefully you have went to nabp.net where you can create a profile and easily track all your continuing education credits.  That is a great place for technicians and pharmacists alike to track their CEUs.  On the PTCB website they list these places to obtain CEUs:   American Pharmacists Association American Society of Health-System Pharmacists Illinois Council of Health-System Pharmacists Michigan Pharmacists Association National Pharmacy Technician Association Pharmacy Technician's Letter Pharmacy Times Power-Pak C.E.® RxSchool ® U.S. Pharmacist    These are just a few examples and included the Power-Pak but I suggest if you are a member of a state organization to look there as they are free usually if you are a member or contact them to see how much they cost.  I haven't done the project or anything like that but it says that subject matter may include medication distribution, inventory control, pharmacy law, drug therapy, pharmacy operations, etc.  You setup a project regarding controlling your store's inventory or heading the form creation, utilization, and documentation for your pharmacy's MTM program or something along those lines.  I think as long as you can show that it relates to pharmacy, your pharmacist will fill out the form, sign off on it, and it allows for learning three objectives you are golden.  Good luck! ",®

t5_2sokd,MrTurburdaugh,1345859904,"Okay well here's the low-down up-town around scoopidy doop.  I am an extraordinary expert in all types of machines and I wrote my PhD about things that Turing so I believe I can help you out here.  I will include a wonderful historical story from history along with my explanation but keep in mind I failed history 46 times from 1906-1912 when I had to continually repeat mean old Mr. Kevin's junior high history exxxxxtravaganza! so the historical element in this story may be entirely made up.  In 1906, coincidentally the same year I began failing history, a young, proper Englishman named Alan Turning began studying in the fascinating field of ultrafast surgical techniques that could be performed while skydiving.  One of his greatest disasters came in 1908, when the printing press was invented by Eli Whitney.  Turning attempted to learn how to use it, but was baffled by the confounded nature of the machine.  Having only one 'n', he spent many years researching how to use the machine to print his name.  Finally, in 1978, he settled on just changing his name to 'Turing' because 'Turnig' sounds stupid.  But from that point on, he vowed that he would spend his time creating a mathematical model that would one day allow us to make Microsoft® Word where you can have as many 'n's as you want.  And, of course, leads us to his famous machine.  His first 19 attempts (many of which were destroyed when Napoleon invaded Mars in 2263) were actually pretty much exact replicas of a printing press.  This is when he made his first realization.  ""Eureka!""  He exclaimed, while clothed (unlike the famous philosophiser Archimesocralato).  ""My machine is not going to physically sit around and print words onto a computer monitor.  It must be an abstract construction!  Turing immediately ran to his most trusted academic partner and closest friend, Macho Man Randy Savage, to work through his thoughts.  ""Listen Andre,"" Turing said.  ""Randy..."" replied Macho Man Randy Savage.  ""Whatever.  Anyway, my machine is going to be capable of doing anything - anything anyone can dream up!  If you only have one 'n' well gosh darnit you can still print your entire name instead of living a life of shame and regret.""  ""Hold on a second,"" said Macho Man Randy Savage, parsing through a textbook on Logic, ""Gödel's incompleteness theorem, published in 2005 by the aptly-named Gödel's incompleteness, says that no universal set of axioms can possibly exist.  No matter how powerful your machine is at granting wishes, there will still be wishes that it can't grant.  It's not a star rod.""  He said incredulously.  Macho Man Randy Savage loves the Paper Mario games.  ""You're right...""  Turing pondered.  ""Hold on, though.  I understand that there are problems that can't be solved by my model, but that's okay.  It will be universal to a very, very important set of problems.  In particular, any problem that is algorithmically decidable will be solvable on my simple mathematical model!  ""Whoa there""  said Macho Man Randy Savage, ""that was a pretty dense statement you just made.  Despite my PhD in computer science where I have extensively studied the set of decidable languages, you should tell me what they are for expositions' sake.""  ""Hey sure thing"" said Turing gleefully.  ""A problem is considered to be decidable if it's computable by an algorithm - essentially, if there's a series of steps that someone can take exactly to get from point A to point B it would turn out exactly the same way every time.  Consider a very basic problem.  I have seven apples in my right hand and one hundred and fourteen apples in my left hand.  If I asked you to tell me how many apples I had, how would you know?""  ""Holy funnelcakes you really do have that many apples!""  Exclaimed Macho Man Randy Savage.  ""However, it's addition.  Addition is a pretty straightforward algorithm.  I know, in my head, what the sum of any two one-digit numbers is.  For example, I can look at 7 and 4 and add them together using predetermined, unchanging information and get 11.  The one then carries, which can be determined by seeing that I now have a two-digit result, and the process repeats as I go down the line.  I can do it for any number, no matter how large.""  ""Exactly!""  Turing said.  ""Now let's think about the fundamental parts of this algorithm as you described it.  You told me you had several very important things in your mind.  Let's go over them!""  ""First, you have the fundamental knowledge of how to add.  And how do we know how to add?  We feed two numbers into that number cruncher you call a head and it spits out another number.""  ""Now, I'm going to write out all the numbers from 1 to 18 on a piece of paper.  18 is the largest number that two one-digit numbers can add up to.  Now, starting from each one digit number, I want you to draw a line to its sum with the second number labelled on the line.  For instance, let's draw a line from '1' to '6' and label it '5', indicating that '5' and '1' add up to '6'.""  ""This seems really tedious"" said Macho Man Randy Savage, while somehow drawing a line from 8 to 1803 and labeling it 'purple'.  ""Yes.  That's why my machine will do it.  This part of the machine is what I call a Deterministic Finite Automata, named after my friend and colleague Deterministic Finite Kevin.  We can give it a one digit number and a starting point (the second point) and after following one line, we have the sum of the two numbers.""  ""Okay, so the machine has some process that determines how to add.  Good, but now what do I do once I have that sum?  Right now we lose that information as soon as the machine gets another input and starting point!  I can't even finish this simple addition problem!""  ""Never fear, Hulk Hogan!  Our Finite Automata has no persistent state, but how do people remember things?""  Turing looked down at the piece of paper still in Macho Man Randy Savage's hand.   ""Ahh you clever dog!""  Said Macho Man Randy Savage, finally understanding what the second essential piece was.  ""We can take the result from the finite automata and write it down!  Once its written down, the machine can tell the finite automata to run again and write down again, and so on and so forth!""  ""Right.  And here's what's even cooler - a finite automata can do ALL of that managing operations for us.  We can have states that say: 'run add on the first two things I see on the paper' 'write down result' 'run add on the next two things' 'is there anything left on the paper to run?'  This automata will be more complicated, but is easily constructable without a persistent state.  It can also run ad infinitum, which allows us to add numbers with as many digits as we desire!""  ""We're gonna need infinite paper for that man..."" said Macho Man Randy Savage.  ""Okay, you've got me hooked.  But this is just simple addition!  How would you manage more complicated problems?""  ""Well, think about this.  Isn't addition just a building block for so many pieces in mathematics?  Well, we just built ourselves one of the most basic building blocks.  I will spend a lot of time proving my Church-Turing thesis, which will state that any arbitrary algorithm can be constructed through the use of our two important pieces: the definite finite automata which contains our rules and operating instructions, and the persistent state, or memory, which we use to record and recall information.""  (Historical note: it is called the Church-Turing thesis because Turing was at odds with the church at the time for going against the papally held belief that the Sun revolved around the Earth.  He named his thesis after the Church to try to make amends.  He also sent them some edible arrangements.  Mmmm!)  ""Unfortunately, the incompleteness theorem is kinda a thorn in my side."" Lamented Turing.  ""See, this machine can't decide problems that are undecidable.  Seems like a self-fulfilling definition there but I promise it's a little important.  Take, for example, the problem of trying to decide whether an arbitrary Turing Machine will ever finish its operation.  Addition is easy - we can look at the automata and decide right away whether or it will get a result or not.  But since we throw a persistent, changeable state into the mix with my machine, we can't always know.""  ""Fortunately, problems that are this hard can't be solved by anyone.  Therefore, I guess my machine is good enough.""  Anything that a computer can do, a Turing Machine can do.  As Macho Man Randy Savage learned, any algorithm can be constructed so that it can be run on a Turing Machine.  This provides a mathematical, abstract representation so that we can study the properties of computation.  Important things include the aforementioned decidability, computational complexity (how long an algorithm will take to run or how much memory it will require), or even recognizability (whether a machine can even recognize a correct answer when it sees one).  Turing would go on to sell his abstract, theoretical machine on eBay to hopeless scrubs who pay for things that don't exist.  He made a fortune and retired to live on Mars with Napoleon and Macho Man Randy Savage, whose name Turing still has yet to learn.",®

Now, there is real value in College insofar one knows what they want, value the staff/personnel the college as chosen to aggregate, value the curriculum/programs, etc. There's some merit, also, to the notion that college affords one an opportunity to spread one's wings, find oneself (in the non-sexual sense, at leas hopefully not for the first time sans genius ""whiz kids""), acclimate to responsibility, etc.  **Consider**, parents and students alike are drawn into schools because of their Brand Name (like Coke® or Northwestern®, *the Harvard® of the Midwest [sic]*, etc), how pretty the campus is, how awesome the partying is, how far away it is from their parents, etc. All noble and lofty goals for an adolescent -- far more venerable than [a teenager aiding in developing a cure more sensitive and specific for cancer screening via non-invasive methods](http://www.care2.com/causes/teen-girl-wins-google-science-fair-for-breast-cancer-computer-program.html).    **Ultimately**, though, many kids/parents do not weight things properly.

A cost that easily outpaces most middle-class incomes and often does not reward one proportionally with the money they sunk into it (save certain ""STEM"" fields and graduate/doc students). Generally, [state colleges](http://www.princetonreview.com/best-value-colleges.aspx) can afford one the best value, i.e. bang for ones buck.  **Time** will tell, I suppose, if this ever-increasingly expensive undergraduate model (the new GED of sorts -- at a cost) will pan out or America will lose its prestigious place at the top of the academic food chain.

See, XSLT is the only decent way to apply markup decorations (navigation bar, header, footer, etc) to a bare web page, and XSLT accepts only XML as input.  This makes it a perfect use case for HTML5's XML serialization: HTML5 → XSLT → HTML5 with said decorations  You *can* do things like this with any old templating system like FreeMarker or PHP, but then there's no guarantees that the result is well-formed, everything that needs to be escaped is, etc. Ugly, messy, error-prone, and generally not worth the massive pain in the ass that it is.  You also can't do fun things like expanding macro elements (e.g. `&lt;w:copyright/&gt;` → `&lt;span class=""copyright""&gt;Copyright © Whatever&lt;/span&gt;`) without XSLT or something like it. Custom markup FTW.  When understood fully and used properly, XML/XSLT/Schema is a joy to work with.",©

t5_2qss1,LogicFlakes,1346024222,"I'd like to state ahead that these are mere suggestions and my insight on the video and its concept. You should only take these words into consideration and never as a firm direction of what you should do.  That's a big head-set. Then again, I just looked at my Turtle Beaches. I guess that size is the norm now. But yes, let's whimper at this game -HEART-! (jokingly mocking because every time I see ♥ I'm reminded of a hilarious hentai parody-dub I came across.) Anywho. I really do hope your fear or startle-ness is real and not fake. And I do hope you get your views as a LPer and not just because you're female.  **Video:**  * Fancy title intro. Quick and recognizable. Pretty big though, but that's me. It's not bad since you stood still and whatnot.  * Watching this at 720p. To my eye, there's not much of a quality increase, but a sharpness and color increase. Seems good, but there's some grain to it. I think this was rendered at h.264 or wmv. I get the same problem with my Dead Space LP. The only fix is some minor color correction and contrast. May want to look into this, but I doubt it'll be needed since Bioshock has a natural dark tone. Course this is because I was looking for video errors.  * I don't think you needed to transition solving the puzzle unless you messed up. I believe some people would like to ridicule you (you're only human) for messing up once or twice. I died about 3-4 times and started transitioning those quick stupid deaths one after another keeping the good commentary.  * If I recall correctly, this game has the option to enable subtitles. Enable it. Do it. This is not mainly a recommendation or an option. Trust me on this. There's no real down-side to enabling this. You sometimes speak over the in-game vocal audio and if you can't fix this or get around it the subtitles will really help you out. This seems to benefit you more because you do like to reply during character vocal scenes (it's fun), so the subtitles will really help balance it out for those who are curious to what they characters are saying.  * I found your ending to be redundant. In fact I find all endings that use LP footage of the game they're lp'ing at the end to be redundant. This is a personal note and not a neutral or general stand-point. I think it would be best to highlight a clip at the end of another game you have LPd or another video. But if you're trying to use the end to high-light (what you believed to be) funny parts in your LP, I think it would be best to highlight what you just showed in the ep, even if it wasn't considered a best in your opinion. Although I must say it was quite hilarious seeing you freak out.  **Audio**  * Quick introduction and welcome. Fancy and basic.  * Mic quality. That's kinda loud. I can't quite explain it, but it's not in terms of how loud you are, but how much the audio is booming. I know your mic has a pop filter, but I think the mic is too close to your mouth because after speaking I can hear the 'after-breath'. There's an issue with this because I feel like you were using a DB boost, but that might not be the case.  I honestly can't pin point it, but if you listen closely to a clear audio track in a LP and listen to yours. You may understand what I mean by the ""boom"" in your commentary audio if you compare it to [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOupGPpjfJU#t=4m20s) or [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wozFfzAfVY#t=6m57s) (listen for about 20 seconds). His audio doesn't seem pressured of the sort. It sounds natural and well balanced. This may be a bit hard for you depending on how loudly or softly you speak. I've had some issues myself with this and thanks to a couple of peer reviews here I think I've gotten the hang of it. What I do is sing and try to hold notes and keep that level of commentary and audio without mumbling. What I would normally mumble I would also try to keep at that audio range.  * Game audio is pretty low. I want to hear Atlas' manly voice! May need to balance the **in-game vocal audio with music/sfx audio**. I think your commentary and game commentary audio is at a good balance.  * ~ok~ balance of keeping quite during in-game audio, but it can be worked a little better. It's kinda hard when it comes to games like these, but the best thing is to surrender and yield to in-game audio. This is your call though to have your viewer want to listen to you or story. I like to not talk because it gives me time to think about commentary about the situation, my thoughts during or after, etc.    **Commentary:**  * The commentary isn't anything special. It is listen-to-able, but for those who are looking for hilarity and unique-ness they might not find it here (in this LP).   * You suffer from the same problem I did (and maybe still do at points, but I am trying to fix that). You tend to announce things you are already doing or looking at a lot. It's ok to this, but not for the whole video. You have bits you ridicule the splicer's death because of science. And then there's another bit after the first memory part where you're trying to get a door to open (before seeing a dead big daddy). That's good. Try to work around that.  * This part didn't really have you whimpering and it seems to be a newer Bioshock LP part. Not much action here, but more of conveying the game. S'all good. Some parts have em, some don't.  * You started off so well with the LP, but I felt like some of the energy was lost (then somehow for a bit regained later on). This did affect your commentary a bit.  **Final Thoughts:**  * The LP wasn't that long. In fact it was barely considered medium length. That's fine with me, but I've found people prefer a 15-24 minute length LP. First-time seeing your LP I was a liiitle engaged, enough to want to keep watching a little more, but it already ended. I think you could have had me or the audience for another 5 more minutes.  * Not a fan of using a gimmick/sexuality/ethnicity to promote oneself, but that's me. I'm not going to tell you that calling yourself A.W.C isn't going to get you less views because that will be a lie. People do fall for that. I also kind of promote this at the same time because I think it'll help more females come out more and not hide themselves to the internet (though I don't blame 'em). This is more a personal thing based on how many people I've met online only to turn out they were female and were nervous on how I or others would react after revealing themselves online.  * You definitely have potential if you fix your mic-quality / volume issue and keep some good energetic commentary. This means clear, understandable vocals, following by quirky comments and remarks.  * I was annoyed a bit when you talked over the game's character dialogue audio. This is me personally, but I'm sure no one likes to listen to two voices at a time and have their brain figure out who to listen to only to figure out before it's too late (Eg. they already finished saying their dialogue after deciding who to pay attention to).  * If I weren't criticizing your video I **MAY** would have left about 7 minutes in (when you reach the machine after the harvest option), but at the same time I saw that I was half-way done. If I wasn't criticizing your video I probably would have stayed because I did keep a small interest at the 8 minute marker. This is because of the big-daddy fight.  * I'll check up on you randomly again maybe around the 1X part of your LP to see how you've improved. I've always tried to finish Bioshock, but I always get as far to Andrew Ryan before I get bored with the game. Watching your LP will be a get around to finally ""finishing"" Bioshock and close that chapter.  Unless I really emphasized you to consider it or do the option provided, remember that this is just critique from one person and this information should be used to reflect and review yourself and maybe open your mind to any problems I or you have missed. There is always room for improvement.  P.S. I just want to throw out that I'm more of someone who only watches/listens to LP if the voice is right. You, my good lass, give me an iffy impression on whether or not I will stay after Bioshock (assuming I stayed for it). This is personal. I'm sure others nit-pick with other things just as much as I do.",♥

Some of the earlier parts are definitely scarier though, that's why I put me freaking out at the end since I thought it needed some screaming at some point.

t5_mouw,delldell,1346094176,"Circumcision is the only surgery in history ever recommended as a universal means of preventing disease. Nowhere else in medicine is surgery on a healthy organ considered an alternative to proper hygiene. The claim that circumcision prevents AIDS was made on the basis of observational studies of men already circumcised and randomized controlled trials where men underwent a circumcision at the start of the study.  All of the studies attempted to predict what happened on a microscopic level by studying conditions on a macro level, which is far less precise. Researchers were not able to observe exactly when, where, or how each individual got infected. Therefore, a fundamental assumption was made that is possible to draw conclusions about the mode of transmission of HIV by enumerating the success of transmission in specific populations.  [Regarding penile sensitivity and HIV transmission], the most common reason men give for not wearing a condom is that it reduces sensation and pleasure. Circumcised men experience a progressive loss of sensitivity as a result of their circumcision, [which] will only discourage condom use further.  [Furthermore], loss of penile skin from circumcision frequently results in tightened, scarred skin on the erect penis.  This eventually increases friction during intercourse, which increases the likelihood of abrasion through which HIV can pass…[also], circumcision advocates propose to persuade men to be circumcised because it will protect them, and afterwards tell them not to have unprotected sex because it won’t protect them. This dangerous [and confusing] message may make many circumcised men worldwide feel that since they are now [supposedly] at decreased risk, they are sufficiently protected without condoms.

Source of the often cited 2% false rape claim figure   http://glennsacks.com/blog/?p=4838  Sources of 40-50% false rape claim figures http://glennsacks.com/blog/?p=3159 http://www.americandaily.com/article/5075  ""According to a nine-year study conducted by former Purdue sociologist Eugene J. Kanin, in over 40 percent of the cases reviewed, the complainants eventually admitted that no rape had occurred (â €œArchives of Sexual Behavior,â€ Vol. 23, No. 1, 1994). Kanin also studied rape allegations in two large Midwestern universities and found that 50 percent of the allegations were recanted by the accuser. ... Kanin's findings are hardly unique. In 1985 the Air Force conducted a study of 556 rape accusations. Over one quarter of the accusers admitted, either just before they took a lie detector test of after they had failed it, that no rape occurred. A further investigation by independent reviewers found that 60 percent of the original rape allegations were false. ... According to a 1996 Department of Justice Report, of the roughly 10,000 sexual assault cases analyzed with DNA evidence over the previous seven years, 2,000 excluded the primary suspect, and another 2,000 were inconclusive. The report notes that these figures mirror an informal National Institute of Justice survey of private laboratories, and suggests that there exists ""some strong, underlying systemic problems that generate erroneous accusations and convictions."" (that's 40% for those not counting) ... That false allegations are a major problem has been confirmed by several prominent prosecutors, including Linda Fairstein, who heads the New York County District Attorney's Sex Crimes Unit. Fairstein, the author of â€œSexual Violence: Our War Against Rape,â€ says, ""there are about 4,000 reports of rape each year in Manhattan. Of these, about half simply did not happen.""""

t5_2qh1i,RecycledEternity,1346106240,"Some things I wish I knew:   * Relax. Being calm is the key here, for pretty much any situation. Alcohol helps here, but don't rely on it. * You don't need to do stereotypical things for dates--like movie &amp; dinner, or homecooked meal by candlelight, or any of that shit. Think outside the box.  * There is no rush for sex. Be intimate, and if it leads there, then it goes there.  * Don't ask about her exes. You'll only either make yourself upset, or look at her like she's damaged, or both. Refer to item 1, and remember that in this instance: ""ignorance is bliss."" Unless it's her sexual history. She needs to be up-front about that; diseases are nothing to trifle with, ya feel me? * If you get dumped, or do the dumping, SOMEONE, regardless of intention, will get hurt. It is inevitable. Don't stay in a relationship 'cause you don't want to hurt the other person.  * Long-distance relationships are not for everyone. For me, personally, they never work out. Find out whether Long Distance Relationships^© are right for you. * If things don't end up working out: there will be more. Love is nothing like the books say; you don't just love ONE person, and if that doesn't work out, then it's The End. No; it's more, you'll always carry a torch for her, in your heart, but you know that it wouldn't work for [these] reasons. So you move on. You find someone else, and inevitably, your heart will work again; you'll find someone else that will make you feel the same way she made you feel.  * On the topic of ""breaking up"".... if it turns out that, for some reason, it was a crazy break-up and you find out she's a crazy bitch, then learn from it. Keep it in mind when you're looking for love again--because if you meet someone with similar traits as her, who tends to overreact to the same shit she did, then it's probably not gonna work out.

t5_2t7no,chrisdancy,1346116765," I'm 43.  I've been in IT my whole life.  Six years ago I started speaking at (IT Conferences) about, IT ""stuff"".  I quickly got bored with telling people what they should have known already.  I started getting involved and following interesting people in social media; twitter mainly, a little facebook, a bit of youtube.  Over the past two years, I have shifted my topics to be more ""futurist""   I combine ideas I read about into concepts that I see today and then just ""imagine"" the middle ground.  Here are some lame powerpoints http://www.slideshare.net/chrisdancy    I usually use a lot of media in them.  I read a lot of crap in reddit and twitter about the social media.  I have been called a ""social media guru"" and  ""futurist"".  I don't think I'm either, I think I'm a good storyteller and an average public speaker.  I can share with you my journey to average joe, that gets to go to a lot of countries and speak about the future, I just returned from Australia where I did a keynote with a dude named “Ross Dawson” who I’m pretty sure is a “futurist”.  You are already doing the hard part, keeping up to date and reading.  Next keep your research (articles, blogs, videos) in evernote or some tool.  Tag them so you can get to them quick. Heck I even use pinterest for fun future videos http://pinterest.com/chrisdancy/video-of-it-future/  Next think up some WILD things you want to speak about and create a description and title, here are mine http://www.servicesphere.com/blog/2012/7/11/roadmaps-for-yesterday-the-2013-conference-season.html  I do this 12 months out so I can start saving the information I need for the presentation, I know nothing about.  Then submit to speak at local meetups, conferences or any event that will let you in!  Grow into who you are, and tie each presentation into your own experiences.  If you are lucky, someone will say, “Hey, you’re like a futurist”  At that point it’s done, you are a futurist.  Oh, one more thing, in the future, you are a futurist, I know this because I’m from the future ☺  Good luck. ",☺

Not sure about the TV (I don't watch much), but I've DEFINITELY noticed that if I sit too long on the laptop (I develop software) or reading a book — I don't know if it's just the sitting or the sitting and looking at something up close — that can make an anxiety attack start coming on. (And by then it's too late for a walk or change of pace to do much good; I've got to set a timer or something.)  I use L-Theanine; it doesn't do much for me, except the actual doing of it (pouring powder in my gums, letting it dissolve... lol, trying not to choke on the ""dust""). But maybe because I'm really used to benzos.  I don't have ""fears"", really. (Or if I do, they're real.) But I do procrastinate on some things. I usually get them done at the very last minute. That's a huge source of anxiety for me, even though I know I make my own problems. (I have a mental block with certain things: I stare at it and can't do it if it deals with my parents. I basically depend on others to push me, or do the things for me. I get physically ill while doing them.)  But these are really unique-sounding tips. Thanks! ♥",♥

Edit: Also - Pam and Jim are supposed to go through a rough time in the last season.  I read all of this on this article which I cannot find right now, but I think it would be kind of interesting.  My guess is that Dwight saw Karen in Jim's bed when they went to Tallahassee, even if Jim tried to kick her out from sex 100 times - and Pam misinterprets this information.  After seeing a good 50(?) hours of footage, I can say that the show is turning out good.  Especially where it left off now with Oscar and the gay senator.  The couples I predict/would like to see: Erin and Andy, Pam and Jim (obviously), Angela and Dwight, Oscar and Senator Robert Lipton, Kevin and Meredith (it was hinted he hit on her season 8), Michael and Holly (duh), Phyllis and Bob Vance, Vance Refrigeration©, Robert and that weird girl.  I have really high hopes for this season.    Also - at the end of the pilot episode, (the first episode) the main theme starting playing as the background music of a scene.  That would be awesome for the last episode.  Also, we're supposed to find out who does the documentary, and who the Scranton Strangler is, and all ""questions we have will be answered.""

Avec 330 millions de locuteurs tout autour du Québec, la langue anglaise ne disparaîtra jamais du Québec. Elle ne deviendra même pas folklorique!!!  &gt; L'anglais deviendra encore plus minoritaire qu'aujourd'hui grâce aux lois telles que la Loi 101 et les immigrants préfèrent apprendre l'anglais comme deuxième langue que le français car c'est plus utile à apprendre grâce au fait que c'est la langue universelle, donc c'est plus facile communiquer à l'international avec l'anglais que le français.   Dans un Québec souverain, il n’y aura absolument plus aucune ambigûité sur le fait que le Québec est indubitablement français.  Évidemment, certains voudront apprendre le rosbif, mais c’est leur affaire.  &gt; Donc, avec la souverainté du Québec arrivera surement une grande baisse de nombre d'immigrants par année.  Et bien, voilà du gratiné: en vlà un qui s’imagine que les immigrants ne viennent ici que pour apprendre le rosbif…  J’ai déjà vu des opinions chtarbées, mais là, on frappe des sommets…  &gt; Pour ce qui est des immigrants qui habitent déjà le Québec, il y a un grand nombre qui partireront avec la souverainté, justement à cause du fait qu'ils parlent surtout l'anglais.  Et bien bon débarras! Ça fera ça de moins pour pousser les immigrants à s’angliciser.  &gt; De même que le français est une très belle langue, c'est un fait que c'est plus utile apprendre l'anglais.   Mais c’est utile aussi de parler le chinois, de tricoter du Phentex®, de faire des grilled-cheese sans que ça colle à la poële, de rouler à vélo, de fourbir un vase, de dévisser un clou, d’arroser les fleurs, de changer son poisson d’eau, de lire un livre de Marcel Aymé, de se limer les ongles, d’effoirer un maringouin, de faire de la confiture de gadelles, de laver les vitres, de chauffer sa maison, de faire du vélo, d’aller voir un film, de marcher dans le parc ou de traire une vache.  &gt; Idéalement, l'on devrait être capable de parler au moins les deux langues, par contre certaines personnes, d'ailleurs les immigrants, n'ont pas l'option d'apprendre les deux, alors ils apprenent l'anglais, ce qui fait que si jamais le Québec devenait un pays séparé du Canada, plusieurs immigrants ne pourront y plus vivre facilement et conséquemment déménageront.  Et bien bon débarras, ça fera plus de place pour ceux qui seront très content de vivre ici.",®

t5_2qpp6,SadCritters,1346332058,"There's this weird thing called mining efficency.   It's pretty important.  ""Muy importante"" one might say.  I understand that in Platinum they don't really worry about that kind of stuff---But getting your natural is pretty important as a Zerg player ( Or any base. ).  Playing one base versus a two-base Protoss is pretty bad.  Like I said---I would willingly test your theory. I'll be Protoss. I'll block you in. 'Then I'll watch you starve or sit eons behind me. It'll be cute~. ♥ ( Because I like to watch people struggle. )  Spending 450 minerals to block a 300 mineral building isn't that bad, considering it then forces a 300 mineral+expense to stop said block, and place a ""macro hatchery"" instead of an actual base.  Not making Zerglings in the early game is entirely forfeit, considering you are doing ZERO damage to the Protoss player until you actually get your natural at least started ( which assumes you've placed a macro hatchery. ). This means the Zerg won't be that far ahead in Drones, because the Protoss player will be running off of two chronoboosting Nexus' to get two fully saturated bases around the same time. As soon as they wall you in, they can pick up Probe production and a Nexus, not have to worry about making units---Since you won't be attacking them for a while, and place late cannons at their base.  I find it laughable that you feel like no damage is done to the Zerg and that it doesn't put them behind.  ( I'm not sure if you know this, but you usually have to kill all three Pylons THEN the cannon. The Queens can't reach the Cannon without being hit as 5&lt;7. The Spine Crawler can't reach the cannon, usually, from the top of the ramp because any smart Protoss will place it behind the third Pylon. This requires you to kill ALL THREE Pylons THEN the cannon while taking your natural at the same time. Do you understand how long that takes in-game for two Queens and a Spine Crawler to do?)  TL;DR: You're wrong and I'd love to test it with you. I'm a Master's Protoss and Zerg and would loveeeeee to see what you're saying work~. ♥",♥

t5_2qpp6,Syphon8,1346333259,"&gt;There's this weird thing called mining efficency. It's pretty important.  There's this weird thing called maynarding.  It's pretty important. Inefficiently mining on 1 base for 20 seconds *does not matter* when it lets you saturate your second base 5 minutes before it's even possible for your opponent to.  &gt;Spending 450 minerals to block a 300 mineral building isn't that bad, considering it then forces a 300 mineral+expense to stop said block  No. It doesn't. It forces nothing, because you'd make the Queens and spine anyways. How can you not understand that? When it was overpowered it forced Roaches because Queens couldn't attack from high-ground.  Do you not understand what the concept of sunk cost is?  It is mathematically impossible for the Protoss to come out ahead if the Zerg responds well. I don't care what you think, you're objectively wrong. Zerg simply makes Drones faster than Protoss can possibly make Probes, especially after delaying production long enough to drop 3 Pylons.  &gt;The Queens can't reach the Cannon without being hit as 5&lt;7  And high ground &gt; low ground. The cannon can't see the Queens.  &gt;Do you understand how long that takes in-game for two Queens and a Spine Crawler to do?)  It takes 2 Queens and a Spine Crawler 16.8 seconds to kill a Pylon.  &gt;I'm a Master's Protoss and Zerg and would loveeeeee to see what you're saying work~. ♥  lol your post tells me different.

Unlike you, everyone else seems to understand how this works and why it works. There's a reason a Protoss player will still do this if they see the opportunity arise.   Ps: You are going to be ""inefficiently mining on one base"" for longer than 20 seconds buddy. How fast do you think you are getting your natural? 'Not to mention---Almost no players ""maynard"" anymore. It's extremely rare in ZvP. You saturate your main---Then Saturate your natural---Then saturate your third. Watch Stephano and DRG more.

t5_2qqjc,TheLoneHoot,1346389965,"904 here too - internet high five  -☺-′ `-☺-  I've often wondered if this was a myth or not.  It would seem to me that even if the caps did matter, that it would be probably cost effective to employ a person along the line of people who separate the stuff on the conveyor to grab plastic water/soda bottles with caps and push that end of the bottle into a small-ish set of rotating rubber cones that would spin the cap off.  I'd say not too much risk of a torque injury since it's not tightening the lid but loosening it, then again, I'm sure there'd be a way for someone to get hurt.  They could even just push the capped end into an opening in a cutting machine that would cut the end off.  In fact I'd bet there would be a way to incorporate that into the automation process.  Moot though, knowing now that the myth has been busted.  Especially locally!  Anyway, glad to hear that this is untrue - one of my daughters keeps telling me that the capped bottles get thrown away and I keep telling her that doesn't make sense financially.  I'll point her to this post.",☺

t5_2smhl,SenSidethink,1346397431,"&gt;The 3600 damage is based on using DFG on someone with 2.2k HP. That sounds like a fair amount. So, yeah, your AD build that you claimed does ""better"" burst damage... does half the burst damage. That's totally the same damage! (No it's not, you're a fucking idiot.)  You math sucks big time. Around 1100 Damage (Since your combo is around 2500) on 2200 hp would mean 50% flat damage. Good luck finding someone with 0 MR. If i would calulate it this way around my garen can oneshot a tank at 1/4 hp, sure thing.  &gt;And, yes, we're comparing pre-mitigation. Which is better for the AP build, as MR tends to be higher than armor. But I'm even willing to concede that point, to your favor. Your pre-mitigation damage is a shitton less for the AD build. Which, again, you said did better burst! Whoops, you can't do math.  You need DFG and Lichbane to do anything beside double W. I can start with a shitton AD and armorpen and just faceroll people by using Q-W-Q-E then go R-Q-W-Q-E and i got 6 sources of AD damage out + 2x W with lower damage while you just got 6 skills with suckish damage since only your W scales with AP.  &gt;(Trinity Force would give ~160 damage per proc, by the by. So, if you only have one proc which is all you give the Lichbane), your build is up to 2.2k)  2.200 compared to around 2.500 without DFG. DFG got a 60sec cooldown while ALL my autohits still deal a heavy amount of damage since i actually have AD. You burn out your ulti and double-W and then you are left with atleast 6sec of doing nothing waiting for your W to come back or trying to get lichbane procs on them. Means AD deals less burst, but still damage AFTER the burst not only every 60sec.  &gt;And Lichbane does give MR, even if it's not a huge amount. It's similar to Hexdrinker. Because, seriously, what 4 items do you get on Rengar that gives 200 bonus AD and a bunch of tanky stats? Maw + Wriggles + BT isn't very tanky.  200 bonus AD is actually pretty easy. Look at the build they used in the spotlight for example. TF, LW, GA all work extremly good on him and you will still end up with heavy amounts of AD while being able to soak damage up.  ###tl:dr:  - AP does a bit more burst, but extremly less dps with a 60sec cooldown on 1/3 of your complete combo. - AD does nearly the same burst, but higher dps without any 60sec cooldown. - Oh yea.. and your math sucks big time.

t5_2qh3p,intoto,1346406248,"Herpes can grow when there is an excess of arginine in your bloodstream.  That amino acid is a major component in the makeup of the virus.  Arginine is a semi-essential amino acid that you get from a variety of food sources, but generally, things like nuts, grains and seeds have them in abundance.  The body can also make it, but most of the arginine comes from eating foods containing arginine.  The body utilizes arginine and lysine via the same pathway for absorption. If you consume high amounts of arginine, you may become lysine deficient, then excess arginine builds up in the body.  That excess arginine can trigger a herpes outbreak, because the virus can access it and start to replicate.    &gt;Professor Lawrence Corey explains that the herpes virus uses human cells like factories to grow new herpes viruses. When the newly grown viruses are completed, they burst through the cell, killing it. These new viruses are then free to infect new cells and repeat the cycle of infection. However, Corey says, growing each new virus requires 84 proteins, mostly composed of arginine. If arginine runs out, the new viruses cannot be finished. No new viruses means no new symptoms.  Read more: http://www.livestrong.com/article/301800-the-effects-of-arginine-on-herpes/#ixzz257CBZTAW  So, what can you do?  Generally, eat a balanced diet of foods and avoid excessive amounts of foods high in arginine (nuts, grains, seeds, chocolate, berries, onions).  Instead, to avoid herpes outbreaks, you can eat foods that are higher in lysine (yogurt, milk, cheese, butter, meat, apples, pears, figs).  Generally, at the onset of a herpes outbreak, there is often a warning of shooting pain occurring from the nerves that are used by the virus to travel to the surface of the mucous-membrane skin.  When you get that pain, avoid arginine high foods and take lysine supplements.  I recommend taking 1g every 4 to 8 hours.  Often the excess lysine in your system causes your body to utilize all the arginine available, leaving none for the virus to use to replicate.  That can stop an outbreak before it ruptures the skin.  All of this information applies to both HSV-1 and HSV-2.  By watching what you eat, taking lysine supplments when an outbreak starts and until it ends, you can, in many instances, practically eliminate future outbreaks.  You can also minimize the length and severity of outbreaks when they do occur.  Lysine supplementation is not completely risk and side-effect free.    &gt;Supplemental lysine can cause side effects including nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain, gallstones and elevated cholesterol, especially when taken at higher doses.   &gt;People with kidney or liver problems and pregnant or nursing women should not take lysine.   Read more: http://www.livestrong.com/article/474717-arginine-lysine/#ixzz257CTJeZv  &gt;Prescription drugs taken orally, such as acyclovir, famciclovir, or valacyclovir have been developed to effectively treat herpes infections. These medications can be used to alleviate the symptoms of an outbreak and shorten its course or to suppress recurrences, reduce the number outbreaks and prevent spreading the disease. This type of treatment is not curative and can get expensive, especially if it is used daily to suppress outbreaks.  &gt;For HSV-2, try taking monolaurin, a nontoxic, antiviral supplement made from lauric acid (a fatty acid found in breast milk) and glycerin. It is used to treat infections with all strains of the herpes virus along with other viral infections including measles, and HIV, the human immunodeficiency virus that causes AIDS. Monolaurin is believed to have the potential to permanently inactivate the fat coated viruses that cause these diseases by fluidizing the lipids (fats) and phospholipids in their envelopes, leading to the disintegration of viral particles. Monolaurin, sold under the brand name Lauricidin®, comes in the form of mini pellets. Dosage should be individualized, and Dr. Jon J. Kabara, the physician/researcher who developed monolaurin, says that the usual recommended initial dose is 1.5 grams once or twice a day for one or two weeks. The dose can be increased to 3.0 grams once or twice daily thereafter. A maintenance dose can be 3.0 grams two or three times a day. The idea is to start with a low dose and then increase it gradually until you notice a positive response. Take monolaurin only under the supervision of your physician, who can prescribe it, determine your best dosage and monitor your progress.  Herpes is not a death sentence.  It can be managed, and it is possible to stop all outbreaks in many people and for many people to never transmit the virus to their partners because they avoid contact when the active virus is shedding.  Become an expert on the virus, how it works, how it can be defeated.  You will be glad you did.  http://www.sandiegohomeopathy.com/downloads/Lysine_Arginine_Foods.pdf   Another drug that is effective is docosanol, but it doesn't require a prescription, so the medical establishment rarely mentions it, although as a topical treatment it is about as effect as acyclovir.",®

What about the functionality, you might ask?   The ThinkPad ($2100) works wonderfully for my video editing and rendering and the FHD screen is glorious. The specs make this computer perfect for my processing-intensive college program (quad-core i7 3.7GHz, 20GB of RAM... 4GB stock, 16GB from eBay...  NVIDIA® Quadro® K2000M, etc.) material-wise, this thing is a tank.

Extremely solid. If you stepped on this, it probably wouldn't missed a frame of rendering... or if you dropped it, it would stop spinning the HDD until it's safe to turn on again.  The MacBook ($1600'ish) on the other hand is A PIECE OF SHIT. After 1 year, it ceases to work (hinge is extremely loose so it doesn't know when it is closed or open so I have to leave it open. when I or someone else accidentally closes it, I've got to unscrew the bottom to remove the battery and reset it. along with that, it overheats even when not on my lap because Apple doesn't put proper air-circulation in their products. because of the over-heating it now cannot even play YouTube videos at 360p quality without lagging or needing 3 minutes to buffer. material-wise, when it's closed (oh no, take those screws out) and you push down on the Apple symbol, the entire aluminum backing bends and if you push too hard you can hear cracking. not something you want to hear from a $1600 piece of sh... erm... ""perfect hardware"".  I have completely switch away from the lie that is Apple.  EDIT: and the TrackPoint... so good.
