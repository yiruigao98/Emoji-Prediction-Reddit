t5_2qhkh,magick23,1354320550,"If it has been in the freezer, the moths won't breed in there anymore? Or just so they don't get in it before I put it in the feeder? Well, I'm actually thinking of not refilling the feeder anymore, it attracted so many birds that they would amass under my carport and throw the seed shells everywhere, there is bird poo everywhere, we witness bird fights all the time (even a bird murder, though the bird skeleton that resulted is kinda neat), and the birds would swoop through the carport when we went outside and nearly crash into us. When the seed runs out, there is a day or two of bird mutiny and I would get a taste of real-life ""angry birds."" I'm not sure if all that is worth it 😏 also, the birds are messy with getting the seeds out of the feeder and would drop seeds in all of my potted plants, so I'm having to pick out new growth all the time.  But anyway, thanks again for your help/info... I am still amazed by these leaf-miners, even though they are reducing my plants' leaves by about half at this point. ",😏

t5_2qhv7,tumba_burros,1354324864,"**gente**  1. En el español general, este sustantivo femenino se emplea como nombre colectivo no contable y significa ‘personas’: «*La gente acudía a su bar*» (Obligado *Salsa* [Arg. 2002]); «*En torno a nosotros había un grupo de gente joven que reía y voceaba*» (Salisachs *Gangrena* [Esp. 1975]). Como otros nombres colectivos, admite un plural expresivo, usado casi exclusivamente en la lengua literaria: «*Fue ella quien me introdujo en las cosas, en las comidas, en las gentes de aquí*» (Benedetti *Primavera* [Ur. 1982]). La divergencia entre su referente (plural) y su número gramatical (singular) puede dar lugar a errores de concordancia (→ [concordancia](http://lema.rae.es/dpd/srv/search?id=XEVeLzVZaD6CG25cW5), [4.7](http://lema.rae.es/dpd/srv/search?id=XEVeLzVZaD6CG25cW5#47)).  2. En el español de ciertas zonas de América, especialmente en México y varios países centroamericanos, se usa también con el sentido de ‘persona o individuo’, es decir, como sustantivo contable y no colectivo: «*Luis era una gente muy caballerosa*» (*Prensa* [Nic.] 3.2.97); con este sentido, su uso en plural es obligado cuando se desea aludir a más de una persona: «*Alrededor de la tina, en la que podían caber cinco gentes, había muchas plantas*» (Mastretta *Vida* [Méx. 1990]). En España solo es normal el uso de *gente* con referente singular en la expresión *buena* (o *mala*) *gente*, que también se documenta en el español americano: «*Yo soy muy buena gente*» (Gala *Invitados* [Esp. 2002]); «*Tato, por su parte, no era mala gente*» (ÁlvzGil *Naufragios* [Cuba 2002]).  3. En el español coloquial de muchos países de América se emplea también, como adjetivo o como sustantivo, con el sentido de ‘[persona] honesta, amable y servicial’ y ‘[persona] distinguida o de buena posición’: «*Sería conveniente que llamara al doctor Pereyda* [...]; *él es muy gente y seguramente no le cobrará*» (Olivera *Enfermera* [Méx. 1991]); «*Ese es para mí menos que nada, aunque estos caballeros hablen de él como si fuera gente*» (Piglia *Respiración* [Arg. 1980]).   *Diccionario panhispánico de dudas ©2005 Real Academia Española © Todos los derechos reservados*",©

t5_2qh2p,Ol_Lefteye,1354328297,"1) What?  2) That's because I didn't make an argument, I asserted a generalization parodying the OP. However, I am claiming that the average shown intellectual depth on religious issues on /r/atheism is abysmal. I am not arguing this; I have no desire to convince you if you see otherwise. To me, it is obvious from perusing /r/atheism and seeing the depth of ""intellectual"" discussion in contrast to discussion by atheistic and theistic philosophers and others _who actually know what they are talking about_ I have read. If you are an atheist and don't see this, I suggest reading up on the actual intellectual tradition of your philosophical position; it's filled with more depth that ""The God Delusion"" utterly lacks. If there were many informed atheists on /r/atheism we would see greater depth in the ideas in posts rather than ""Religion, LOL.""  3) I like how /r/atheists hold up Logicreason© so highly and then make fundamental logical errors at every turn. You are a great example. Firstly, this is a false dilemma; the list of options are greater than ""either atheists are ridiculous and theists are not, or theists are ridiculous and atheists are not."" It can also be the case that both groups are ridiculous, or that neither are. However, this _isn't even relevant to anything_ because I made no assertion that atheism is ridiculous, but rather that /r/atheism is. You're making major category errors here.   &gt;Overall? You're an idiot who shouldn't be defending Christianity - you're a piss poor representative of your deluded kind.  _Another_ category error. Where is Christianity mentioned at all? ",©

t5_2r9vp,rorykane,1354342077,"My first time;   My friend and I went over to his friends who was having a kickback. We joined the circle and after passing on the rotating bong I agreed to go for it. My mentally braced myself for whatever and pulled as hard as I could, but got nothing. After various attempts to pull we concluded the bowl had clogged so we cleaned it out and filled the water back up and packed it up. Again bracing myself I pulled as hard as I could as my friend held the lighter. I watched the smoke rush through the bong and up but I kept pulling watching the bowl torch almost completely before the need to cough over came me. After exhaling and coughing for about 10~ minutes I sat back down on what had become the most comfortable couch ever. For the next 2~ hours I sat there with tunnel vision watching these seasoned ents ask me questions and laugh a bit as I could barely comprehend what they were saying. The kickback ending I realized I had to drive my friend and I back to his then back to my house. Attempting to clear my head I drank a cup of water, washed my face, and gathered my friend and we set off home. I do not remember driving back but I remember getting home and going to the fridge, cutting myself a rather huge piece of my moms ""death by chocolate"" cake and returning to my room to inhale it then pass out on my bed. ✌",✌

t5_2rske,gogge,1354366198,"[Centrum Specialist® Energy](http://www.centrum.com/centrum-specialist-energy) contains 40 mg magnesium (Magnesium Oxide) and 80 mg potassium (Potassium Chloride, same as mineral salts), the RDAs are way higher than that.  Mineral|Adequate Intake (mg) |:--|--: Sodium|1500 Potassium|4700 Magnesium|420 Calcium|1000  With keto you might not need the full 4700 mg of potassium, some recommendations are a bit lower at 2500 mg. You excrete more sodium the need for potassium is lower, with a high carb intake a high potassium intake is mostly to balance sodium levels (high insulin levels causes you to retain sodium).  &gt; The diuretic (dehydrating) nature of ketosis causes an excretion of three of the body’s primary electrolytes: sodium, potassium, and magnesium (31,40). These three minerals are involved in many processes in the body, one of which is the regulation of muscle contraction, including the heart.  Some studies show a net loss of calcium while others do not (31).  &gt; To counteract the excretion of minerals on a ketogenic diet, additional mineral intake is  required.  Although exact amounts most vary, suggested amounts for the three primary  electrolytes appear below (26,46):  &gt; Sodium: 3-5 grams in addition to the sodium which occurs in food   Potassium: 1 gram in addition to the 1-1.5 grams of potassium which occur in food   Magnesium: 300 mg    [""The Ketogenic Diet""](http://books.google.se/books?id=JtCZBe-2XVIC&amp;lpg=PA79&amp;ots=dNISh1zQJz&amp;hl=en&amp;pg=PA79#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false) by Lyle McDonald, page 79.  It's probably easier to get nutrients through food, or if you need potassium you can use a mineral salt. Using a mineral salt (like [Morton's Lite Salt](http://www.fatsecret.com/calories-nutrition/morton/lite-salt)) gives you 2500 mg potassium per 10 gram. A 100 grams of Spinach gives you [around 560 mg of potassium](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=spinach+100+gram), a 100 grams of Avocado gives you [about 450 mg of potassium](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=avocado+100+gram), a 100 grams of beef has [about 300 mg](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=beef%20100%20gram).  If you want to supplement potassium look for ""Potassium Citrate"" as that has good absorption rate, [and it's used in some studies as a way to prevent kidney stones](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19911683). In the US the regular potassium supplements are usually limited to ~100 mg, so most of them are practically useless.  Almonds has [289 mg of magnesium per 100 grams](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=almonds 100 grams), Spinach has 79 mg magnesium per 100 grams.

I spent this weekend surrounded by people in the petroleum/natural gas industry. I concluded two things:  1) They have convinced themselves that Obama is stupid and evil and wants to put them all in the poorhouse, because scientists want us all to be communist atheists. To hear them talk, Obama's first term was spent sucking half their bank accounts dry and his second term will be spent finishing the job. Never mind that the lowest paid among them had a six-figure salary, nice house, etc. Nope, I was the crazy one because I voted for him, and it was just a matter of time before Obama finished shredding the constitution and the food rationing began.  2) They have a regard for the environment, but ultimately don't care enough about it to sacrifice any profits. You'd have thought they were handing out Christmas presents when they talked about fracking in people's backyards, even though they themselves admitted that ""it was a shame about the water table"". Their response on that was ""We wouldn't be in this mess if that nigger in tha White House would invest in de-salinazation plants. There's plenty a water out in tha Gulf.""

t5_2sokd,LeeHyori,1354383024,"Let's say tomorrow I went on my computer and started printing a bunch of papers with numbers on them (I am printing my own money from my computer).  Now, some people in my area really trust me and take my money seriously and have agreed to only take the papers I print as their currency.  Let's say that one of these people owns a coffee shop. In order to buy a latte at her coffee shop, they must pay in my papers. However, because people value my papers, no one is going to give it up freely. So, let's say that the coffee shop lists that a latte should sell for ♥20LHD (LeeHyoriDollars).  Now, the person who wants to buy this coffee needs to get their hands on some LHD. So, they go meet up with everyone who has LeeHyori dollars (perhaps on a small market, or at some booth that is willing to trade LHD for American dollars [USD]). They know they need ♥20LHD for the latte, so they go and they say ""Here, I'll give you $2 USD for ♥20LHD.""   The guy with the LHD says, ""Psh! No way! Give me $10 USD and we have a deal.""  The latte buyer responds ""Are you kidding? $5 USD.""  Finally, the guy with LHD says ""All right, fine. $5 USD and I'll give you ♥20LHD.""  Now, they trade. So, now, that means that the most recent market transaction involving USD to LHD set the *exchange rate* at 1:4. That is, $1 USD is worth ♥4LHD.   Other people seem to be agreeing around the same price and so most people start to trade at a 1:4 rate like this, and so (as of the moment) the exchange rate between $ and ♥ is 1 to 4.  So, if you want to put the latte in USD terms, then a latte that costs ♥20 LHD is technically worth $5 USD.  **Keep in mind:** You need to remember that money is something that is bought and sold as well. People have this notion that only ""things"" are bought with ""money."" But, no, money is a ""thing"" too; it's just a more ""liquid"" thing (easier to transact with), and so people desire it for that reason. So, exchange rates (which change constantly due to people trading, like the LHD and the USD folks) are really just a reflection of the supply and demand of a given currency.  As for purchasing power, let's say that near my house, a latte is around ♥20LHD, but in the USA, a latte generally goes for $20 USD. Let's say I have ♥20LHD in my wallet.  So, the ""purchasing power,"" say, of what I have in my wallet will get me 1 latte where I live. However, when I go to the US, when I trade my LHD for USD, I end up with $5USD only (because of the 1:4 exchange rate). So now, I can't even buy a latte in the US, because I don't have $20 USD. This is the relative purchasing power; my ""buying power"" of 20 LHD is weaker in the US than it is where I live. It's all just a comparison like that.  Let's look at the [Big Mac Index and the Starbucks Latte Index](http://www.google.ca/imgres?imgurl=http://media.economist.com/sites/default/files/cf_images/20040117/CFN272.gif&amp;imgrefurl=http://www.economist.com/node/2361072&amp;h=406&amp;w=265&amp;sz=14&amp;tbnid=CLHPlsSqcM9yQM:&amp;tbnh=83&amp;tbnw=54&amp;zoom=1&amp;usg=__P2oc_j3IlOAKhS_uJcYIin7FLPc=&amp;docid=cmOOHxE9EZP90M&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KT66UILxCqnI0QGU0YAo&amp;ved=0CDgQ9QEwAQ&amp;dur=117).  What it basically means to show is that when there is a disparity in purchasing power (like we had above), then either the LHD is ""undervalued"" or the USD is ""overvalued"" relative to getting the same item (they use Big Macs and Starbucks Lattes because they are common items found in so many countries). The reason why you say undervalued and overvalued is because there is no authoritative currency, so you have to talk about it always in relative terms.  And, for the sake of these indices, they usually normalize the price around the going price in USD as an arbitrary standard to make it easier to understand.    **Recap:** Remember, the value of a currency is whatever people value it to be. This is called subjective value (part of the subjective theory of value). http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjective_theory_of_value There is no ""inherent"" value to anything; the value of something comes from people's valuation of it. This is contrasted with the old obsolete view in economics called the Labor Theory of Value, which says that the value of something is the result of the labor that went into producing it. This, by the way, happens to be a backbone in Marxian economics, because when you understand the value of things through the LTV, then you see how when people profit, it means that they must be profiting off of the labor of laborers. Therefore, the only way to draw a profit is to exploit workers (the laborers that made the value of the item). Anyway, this is wrong.  Also, I used ♥LHD to try and get people out of the idea that there are these really authoritative currencies (well, there are, since governments usually monopolize the printing of ""legal tender"".) However, theoretically, money is whatever people choose it to be.  Lastly, I wanted to illustrate that the reason why people trade X for money is because people have agreed to accept money (say, ""dollars"")—making it very liquid. Liquidity is important. Currency could be anything. It could be toy ponies or gold. If I went to a Starbucks and they accepted toy ponies for lattes, and then everyone else in society stated to be like ""Okay, toy ponies are legit,"" then toy ponies would become a currency. Unfortunately, this isn't the case. People, instead, agree on some form of currency, so that they don't have to all barter with each other. So, money is highly liquid because everyone accepts it and it has a low transaction cost (makes transactions easier, faster, and is agreed upon by everyone, so it retains its value from exchange to the next).

t5_2sh5g,suntzusartofarse,1354425020,"[Meta Off] Can't resist replying to a post mentioning Marx!  When neckbeards use that quote, they like to think of stupid religious people all sitting around and getting high, but the full quote is:   &gt; Religious distress is at the same time the expression of real distress and the protest against real distress. Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, just as it is the spirit of a spiritless situation. It is the opium of the people.  Marx meant that religion is something the working class used to cope with their lives being shitty (and back then, their lives really were shitty), religion says: even if this life is bad, the next life will be better; it's just a finite amount of suffering, followed by an eternity in paradise. Therefore, Marx didn't mean religion is an illicit drug as such, more that it's a painkiller or placebo.  It's also not, in my opinion, condescending or pompous enough for InternetAtheists™, since Marx shows a lot of respect for religion by acknowledging it brings meaning and hope to peoples' lives.  This view of religion can be found elsewhere, and was even carried through to the protest songs sung during the industrialisation of the US and Canada. Many of the songs the Industrial Workers of the World sang were perversions of Salvation Army hymns, and if you listen to the lyrics of something like Joe Hill's [Power in a Union](http://youtu.be/gBdclC0TtGA?t=2m35s)\* or [The Preacher and the Slave](http://youtu.be/PJ236CwhlPw?t=2m8s) (sorry, those were the best versions I could find on Youtube) the idea is in there. Not sure whether Joe Hill got the idea from Marx, but I enjoy the similarities.  Try telling the people on /r/atheism this though (or that the radical left have historically always been the ones questioning religion, so questions about Stalin and the USSR aren't without merit) and they'll down-vote the post.  \* incidentally, if you rewind it a bit, you'll see the documentary I got that song from was narrated by the founder of the ACLU, who was a Wobbly (member of the IWW). And lefties get all butthurt when conservatives question the ACLU's political leanings? It's not surprising really.  _EDIT_: grammar.",™

t5_2qhw1,_electricmonk,1354453622,"Yes, just lets think of the application of one 50-person unit, each controlling 10 personas. Thats 500 shill accounts for *one* sponsor.  I've multi-accounted for trolling (fun kinda trolling) purposes and its easy. Characters that are unlike are not even necessary to roleplay when your accounts posting history has been (and *is*, ongoing) taken care of by NTrepid (and i imagine continues to be taken care of even while you're posting, just look to accounts like trapped_in_reddit and potato_in_my_anus for recent examples of alleged *multi-user* accounts, its easy to do).  One team making the accounts ""le herp and le derp on le reddits lol"" (sorry) and the other team making the actual ""shaping of public opinion""/""inform and influence"" shilling.  Check out my post here, two pieces on how the military [""Inform and Influence""](http://www.reddit.com/r/Intelligence/comments/13xuz2/strategic_communications_how_nato_shapes_and/) - but really anyone can do this who has the sponsors who care enough to dump cash into an Op, say Super-PAC's for instance.  This is all evidence that this is *possible*, it exists *somewhere*. It still makes calling out individual accounts (on reddit, for example) with certainty often impossible, they enjoy high levels of plausible deniability.  I see /r/anonymous a pretty apt place for speculating, seeing as i imagine a lot of us were spawned in the default anonymity of 4chan calling out samefags and trolls with no identifying marks beyond their posting style and content (4chan has this posterID thing now, right? i dont go there anymore...) - we have a hightened spidey-sense for trolls.  Nothing more to add really, if i offer any specific examples of trolls shot down, i imagine i'll get shot down myself as a wingnut, conspiratard, etc... Be controversial/neutral on issues that affect ""The Good Guys™"" though, and analyse the responses you get in mainstream reddit, be open-minded, you'll see some more visible than others, you can only engage them on their terms, but you'll see them.

Realistically, your level 1 Fighter that takes 7 damage against his 8 HP likely came out of that fight with some permanent muscle, tendon, bone, or nerve damage. Shot or stabbed in the shoulder (a very common location for arrows to hit The Hero™ in movies)? While there is a ""dead zone"", so to speak, for the arrows or stab wound to occur without any lasting damage, it's not a guarantee and if it doesn't hit that ""dead zone"", you're going to lose partial or full use of that arm. Not much of a Fighter at that point. Hell, maybe he went into his negative HP, 1 point away from death...yet he can still recover given enough bed rest with no ill effects.

It's from the University of MN Cooperative Extension.   [Canning apple pie filling using tapioca or cornstarch as the thickener is an outdated and risky method. Botulism is not a major risk with this product because of the high acid content of the apple filling. However, using cornstarch or tapioca may cause the filling to be too thick for the heat to penetrate to the center of the jar and kill spoilage organisms throughout the product, which is a food safety issue. Cornstarch and tapioca will also break down during the canning process and your pie filling will be runny which is a quality issue.

t5_2qim4,austeregrim,1354489109,"Since I felt this was really long for some people,   &gt;TL;DR: If you plan on trying to earn money from a copyrighted or patented design, it's best to talk to a copyright or patent lawyer first. And if you don't have the money to back up a legal battle with the copyright/patent holder, you probably just shouldn't.   For personal use is a different matter, up until recently it's been known that you can do whatever you want with copyrighted material for personal use (meaning not distributed to the public, and especially not sold) but this gets cloudier and cloudier with every lawsuit against ""copies"" of digital medium.  COPYRIGHT INFO:  Source: http://www.copyright.gov/title17/  A quick review of the copyright laws, you may want to look into ""Derivative Works""  &gt;§103 · Subject matter of copyright:  &gt;Compilations and derivative works &gt;(a) The subject matter of copyright as specified by section 102 includes compilations and derivative works, but protection for a work employing preexisting  &gt;material in which copyright subsists does not extend to any part of the work in  &gt;which such material has been used unlawfully. &gt;(b) The copyright in a compilation or derivative work extends only to the  &gt;material contributed by the author of such work, as distinguished from the preexisting material employed in the work, and does not imply any exclusive right  &gt;in the preexisting material. The copyright in such work is independent of, and  &gt;does not affect or enlarge the scope, duration, ownership, or subsistence of, any  &gt;copyright protection in the preexisting material.  &gt;§ 106  ·  Exclusive rights in copyrighted works38 &gt;Subject to sections 107 through 122, the owner of copyright under this title has &gt;the exclusive rights to do and to authorize any of the following: &gt;(2) to prepare derivative works based upon the copyrighted work;  &gt;§ 401  ·  Notice of copyright: Visually perceptible copies2 &gt;(a) General Provisions.—Whenever a work protected under this title is &gt;published in the United States or elsewhere by authority of the copyright owner, &gt;a notice of copyright as provided by this section may be placed on publicly dis- &gt;tributed copies from which the work can be visually perceived, either directly or &gt;with the aid of a machine or device. &gt;(b) Form of Notice.—If a notice appears on the copies, it shall consist of the &gt;following three elements: &gt;(1) the symbol © (the letter C in a circle), or the word “Copyright”, or the &gt;abbreviation “Copr.”; and &gt;(2) the year of first publication of the work; in the case of compilations or &gt;derivative works incorporating previously published material, the year date of &gt;first publication of the compilation or derivative work is sufficient. The year &gt;date may be omitted where a pictorial, graphic, or sculptural work, with ac- &gt;companying text matter, if any, is reproduced in or on greeting cards, postcards, &gt;stationery, jewelry, dolls, toys, or any useful articles; and &gt;(3) the name of the owner of copyright in the work, or an abbreviation by &gt;which the name can be recognized, or a generally known alternative designa- &gt;tion of the owner.  The copyright laws aren't really clear, in my opinion, at least not in from what I read about derivative works, and the legality of distribution. But if the author of the original works never gave the author of the new works any contribution, it makes me believe that this is enough to call it an ""artistic rendition"".   There is some precedence, for example, Andy Warhol's artistic renditions of the Campbell's Tomato Soup Can.  When I was studying art in college, my instructor explained to us the legal requirements for ""artists renditions"", which was a minimum of 7 distinct differences between the original and the ""new"". If the author of the new works can clearly define the 7 differences between the original and the artistic rendition, he is then by definition of the law, in the clear. But does not mean that Apple or the owner of said copyright can't attempt to sue for damages. (Anyone can sue for any reason, doesn't mean they'll win.)  It's risky to sell a model of a copyrighted item, and unless you have the money to support yourself in a legal battle, and you have the evidence to back up your claim of Artistic Rendition; I'd suggest don't even try!  ----  USES:  What would you pay 100$ for a model of an iphone for?  I'd guess to make an advertisement. To attempt to show that an app or website running on the iphone without actually having one for a photo shoot?  Lets say you've got a business that buys and sells old phones. You don't have the money for a full live action commercial, so you get a rendered version, and you want to show people that they can sell their old iPhone to you... your animated character can hold an artistic rendition of an iphone, or other android device. And he can drive away in his 3d model of a Ferrari.  ----  In the end, if you want to get into that business of it, I'd suggest talking to a copyright lawyer. Find out what your responsibilities are as an artist for making renditions of copyrighted works. And what your legal claims are for the original renditions.  I'm not a lawyer, and this article is purely my opinion on the matter. I would recommend talking to a lawyer about this before attempting to sell any 3d models (even artistic renditions) of copyrighted materials.  ----  *Edit: After some more research, I feel there is a big problem with our patents system vs copyright system. For copyrighted material, all you need to do is clearly state that the material is copyrighted to the owner, and any income derived from the materials should be given as royalty to the owner of the copyright. (At a percentage)... where patents, like what apple has, on the design of the iphone, should not ever happen, it's an artistic design that has no function on the device. Where apple shouldn't be able to sue over the ""rectangular"" shape of a phone design patent, because that is not patent-able. The rectangular shape is only copyright-able, and should never have been patented. What is patentable on the iphone, (from a design aspect) is only the antenna design that uses the materials of the case/cover to extend the antenna capability.*  *Since the ""design"" of the iphone is a patent, this is different than copyright laws! So everything I've said above has no bearing on the issue of what is legal for artistic rendition of ""patented designs""... In fact, I can't find anything readily available on this issue. And may be a moot issue since it's patented and not copyrighted. So you may be able to use the depiction of a patented design without regard. BUT I HAVE NO IDEA!*  The only answer that anyone can really give is; **(TL;DR) Talk to a patent attorney and/or a copyright attorney, within regards to if you can legally make an income on patented/copyrighted designs.** A royalty may apply, and the artist who has the material on some website may have rights to do so with royalties paid or contracted.

I'm just going to quote this comment from the article in it's entirety because it NEEDS to be read. &gt;Notably, female faculty members were as significantly discriminatory as males."" In my opinion (and experience), this behavior is rooted in five sources:  &gt;1. Intra-sexual competition. People like to go on about how women support each other, but I only saw this really happen for a short period right at the beginning of the womenâ€™s movement. Women compete with each other, sometimes viciously. I have heard many a female academic state that they like it best when they are the only woman on the panel, committee, whatever. When another woman joins, they attack each other. I have heard young female academics refer to this syndrome as â€œpulling up the ladderâ€; once a woman has scaled the heights of academia, she pulls up the ladder so that other women canâ€™t threaten her vaunted position. Not all women are like this; some are wonderful mentors and collaborators. But too many are like this.  &gt;2. Women who are promoted are precisely those who adopt a male belief system. Part of this belief system is that women are inferior, but they amend this tacitly to â€œother women are inferiorâ€.  &gt;3. Women who are promoted are also precisely those who adopt a male lifestyle. That means marrying the job, fobbing childrearing off onto others (i.e., women who occupy lower status in society precisely because they â€œwaste their timeâ€ raising children), putting as first priority climbing the ladder and grabbing power and fame, and penalizing those who seek to balance work-family demands instead of sacrificing their families to their jobs. This is the male way.  &gt;4. The workplace refuses to accommodate family formation in any credible way. In the 1950â€™s men could pursue their careers unhampered by family demands because their wives were home raising their children and keeping house. In the new millennium, both partners are trying to achieve that vaunted goal. For young scientists, that means someone is going to get sacrificed. Either one partner is going to have to sacrifice his or her career in order to engage in the very demanding task of family formation, or their offspringâ€™s childhoods are going to get sacrificed through institutionalization, i.e., infant and toddler daycare, where they will spend the overwhelming majority of their waking hours.  &gt;We fought for things like stopping oneâ€™s tenure clock, and not demanding that women wait until tenure to start their families (talk to women of my generation and see how many needed draconian fertility treatments just to get or stay pregnant because they put off family formation until they were tenured). But apparently, according to young female academics Iâ€™ve spoken to, tenure committees frown on those who do stop the tenure clock, so most will try to grit their teeth and try to do the tenure push while starting a family.  &gt;Of course, the men who begrudgingly allowed stopping the tenure clock believed pregnancy was the issue, and once that thing was out of your body, you could get back to work. A baby isnâ€™t a tumor. It is a very demanding creature that needs most of all a stable social environment in which to bond, attach, and develop. Does that sound like infant daycare to you? Women who adopt the male viewpoint on the triviality of childrearing during those all important 0-4 years will proudly pontificate on how it was sooo easy to â€œdo it allâ€, meaning that they fobbed their children off onto women of lower status so they could focus on what was most importantâ€”their careers.  &gt;5. Female scientists who refuse to make the sacrifice of Abraham (in case you miss it, the job is God in this metaphor) are shoved into the â€œmommy trackâ€, that is, the lectureships and adjunct positions where they are buried under heavy teaching loads as punishment for the crime of not putting their careers first. In the U.S., contingent faculty now make up over half of all faculties, and the majority of the growth in contingent faculty are female scientists and scholars with young children. Michelle Obama spoke about the centrality of family formation in the loss of female talent from science in her address to the National Science Foundation in 2010. I have published opinion pieces on this topic in popular venues, but no academic venue will take it seriously. Raising this issue only brings a cacophony of catcalls from women who have either â€œdone it allâ€ and donâ€™t see what the problem is, or those who plan to â€œdo it allâ€. Of course, speak to those women and they will freely admit that they offloaded most of their childrearing responsibilities onto family members, non-academic husbands, nannies, or infant/toddler daycare. They also scorn young academics who show any hesitation to do as they did.  &gt;Even women on contingent tracks manage to rack up very respectable vitas while teaching far more than the â€œreal womenâ€ who did it the manâ€™s way, they are rarely allowed back into the tenure stream. After all, they were not really serious about their careers, were they? If they were, they would have spent 100+ hours weekly during their prime reproductive years in the lab, on the editorial boards, and at the conferences. Weâ€™re in the workplace for 40+ years these days, but anyone (male or female) who opts to put family formation above job demands even for 4-5 years signs the death warrant to their careers. Thatâ€™s the male way, and it hasnâ€™t changed since the 1950â€™s. The only thing that has changed is the proportion of women who gleefully adopt this belief system and lifestyle, and then roll up their sleeves to punish anyone else who doesnâ€™t. Contingent faculty, they believe, are their to carry the heavy teaching loads so the â€œrealâ€ scientists and scholars can build their vitas. In fact, there is a published paper floating around entitled something like â€œHow many publications is a baby worth?â€  &gt;So when conference organizers, tenure committees, and editorial boards lament the dearth of women in their midst, and wonder, wonder, wonder how this keeps happening, I hope they keep this in mind. If you are looking for women who have the same credentials as men, you are looking for women who blindly accept a male value system and male lifestyle. Period. THAT is what you are selecting for, not quality of scholarship or quality of scientific contributions.",™

Jesus said that whoever calls somebody a ""fool"" shall be in danger of hell fire (Matthew 5:22), yet he called people ""fools"" himself (Matthew 23:17)  Deuteronomy 23:2 ""No one born out of wedlock or any descendant of such a person, even in the tenth generation, may be included among the Lord's people.""  1 Samuel 15  15:2 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I remember that which Amalek did to Israel, how he laid wait for him in the way, when he came up from Egypt.	     15:3 Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.

Plan B One-Step® works in a similar way to help prevent pregnancy from happening. It works mainly by stopping the release of an egg from the ovary.

t5_2v9bv,mtux96,1354527063,"'Lego' is a brand name. It is not a noun. Lego is actually an adjective to describe the ""bricks"" and ""toys"" you are playing with. The correct formal term is actually 'Lego bricks' or 'Lego® bricks' if you want to be super technical.  'Lego' and 'Legos' are simply colloquial words used in informal language, which are both accepted, just one isn't accepted by one group who thinks there term is better, even though it is technically as wrong as the other term.  The deeming of the ""correct"" plural version of Lego 'bricks' may date back to a printing of a 1980 Lego Catalog where the following was printed by the Lego Corporation:  &gt;Dear Parents and Children           The word LEGO(R) is a brand name and is very special to all of           us in the LEGO Group Companies. We would sincerely like your           help in keeping it special. Please always refer to our bricks           as 'LEGO Bricks or Toys' and not 'LEGOS.' By doing so, you will           be helping to protect and preserve a brand of which we are very           proud and that stands for quality the world over. Thank you!              &gt;                          Susan Williams     &gt;                        Consumer Services  This might have lead people to dismiss the 'Legos' plural version to be incorrect as they are misinterpreting the letter to be saying that the 'Legos' plural is incorrect, but in fact, it is just saying the Lego corp. wanted you to refer to their products as 'Lego Toys or Bricks' to protect their trademarking/branding. That letter never mentioned the plural version of 'Lego' to be 'Lego' and had no intention to do so. Their intention, which failed miserably, was to get people to call them 'Lego Bricks' or 'Lego Toys' as opposed to 'Legos'/'Lego.'  Personally, I would take that letter on the back of the catalog to give more credence to the colloquial plural term of 'Lego' to be 'Legos' over 'Lego' as the Lego Corporation is verifying the usage of the term 'Legos' to being used as the plural form of 'Lego' when referring to be playing with multiple 'Lego Bricks.'

You're still not going to use a $400 camera to shoot a feature film though - just because it is 4K doesn't mean it has the quality you need.  Think about a smartphone camera. Some of them are 12mp. That really means nothing. It's not equal to a 12mp DSLR because the sensor and everything else about it is different.  Also, 1080p is 1920x1080, not 800.

Securing a Latin American player is the priority.* &gt; &gt;By Kevin Baxter &gt; &gt;8:05 PM PST, December 2, 2012 &gt; &gt;The Galaxy celebrated Saturday's MLS Cup victory deep into Sunday morning. But when Coach Bruce Arena and Tim Leiweke, the team's chief executive, awoke later that day, the countless champagne toasts weren't the only things that had their heads spinning. &gt; &gt;Because after winning consecutive league titles with David Beckham and Landon Donovan, the team must now figure out a way to win without one and possibly both players. &gt; &gt;""There's little doubt in my mind that we're going to have some transition here,"" said Leiweke, president of AEG, the global sports and entertainment company that owns the Galaxy. ""We'll play it out, see what happens. But you make good decisions by being prepared."" &gt; &gt;Which is why Leiweke and Arena began talking over off-season scenarios even before the Galaxy began its victorious playoff run. They started preparing for Beckham's MLS retirement during the summer, weeks before it was announced publicly. What Donovan will do is less certain; the player, who has a year left on his contract, says he doesn't know whether he'll play next season. &gt; &gt;That leaves the team with one, maybe two, designated player spots — exemptions to the league's frugal salary cap that allow teams to sign big-name stars to MLS contracts — and Leiweke has been hard at work on filling those. Last month, the Galaxy was in talks with former FIFA world player of the year Ronaldinho, but last week the 32-year-old signed a contract extension with his Brazilian club, Atletico Mineiro. So Leiweke has turned his attention to Kaka, another former world player of the year from Brazil who currently plays for Real Madrid. &gt; &gt;Chelsea's Frank Lampard has also reached out to the Galaxy, but Leiweke said the team's new contract with Time Warner Cable and its Spanish-language channel make the signing of a Latin American player a priority. &gt; &gt;""Look, if Wayne Rooney wants to come, we'll make an exception. But the reality for us right now, our thinking, is … iconic players that have a special relationship with the Hispanic community,"" he said. &gt; &gt;The Galaxy's third designated player, striker Robbie Keane, is under contract for two more seasons with an option that could keep him here through 2015. But squeezing the rest of the roster within the league's complicated salary budget of roughly $4 million for next season will be tough. &gt; &gt;Midfielders Mike Magee and Juninho — on loan from Sao Paulo — will be out of contract at the end of the year, as will goalkeeper Josh Saunders, whose future with the team is further clouded by the Galaxy's interest in trading for Chivas USA keeper Dan Kennedy. &gt; &gt;The entire backline of Omar Gonzalez, A.J. DeLaGarza, Todd Dunivant and Sean Franklin is signed for another year, although the team expects Gonzalez, the MLS Cup most valuable player, to draw loan interest from several European clubs. Midfielder Marcelo Sarvas and forward Edson Buddle are also signed, and midfielder Christian Wilhelmsson has an option for next season that may prove too expensive for the Galaxy to pick up. Unlike other pro leagues, MLS' strict salary rules do not allow teams to pay a tax for violating the payroll cap. &gt; &gt;""My guess is we're going to have a lot of questions,"" Arena said. ""It's never smooth, although you'd like it to be. There's always another issue that comes along and makes things difficult. And I'm sure we're going to have it again this year."" &gt; &gt;The Galaxy will hold a public victory celebration Monday at 7 p.m. in the Home Depot Center's tennis stadium. The entire roster, including Beckham and Donovan, is expected to participate. &gt; &gt;kevin.baxter@latimes.com &gt; &gt;Copyright © 2012, Los Angeles Times",©

t5_2qpp6,Jo3M3tal,1354565207,"&gt; 1\. Redesign Thor ability/Raven seeker missile  Thor ability is bad game design wise, seeker missile is good but too hard to use.  Glad to see Blizzard addressing this  &gt; 2\. Push early game Reaper a bit more  Wasn't really needed, I felt like early game reaper would be more common in the future, it is just hard to use so therefore takes time.  Blizzard has to be careful buffing stuff like this, look how long it took for everyone to realize how op infestors were.  &gt; 3\. Hellbats better against melee units, not necessarily better vs. Ranged.  This is really one of the major problems right now with Mech in TvP, chargelots still destroy the composition.  Blueflame hellbats don't really destroy them fast enough, and your tanks end up killing your hellbats.  Hopefully Blizzard found a good way to address this considering how effective hellbats are in TvZ.  &gt; 4\. We'd really like to see more Medivac usage like we saw in Wings for a time in the past. Currently thinking on a cooldown based speed booster ability.  This seems sort of silly.  Again as player skill increases you see a trend of more medivac usage (really it is just that good players retreat their medivacs early and/or pick battles that wouldn't cost them medivacs).  Would be really interesting (and good for the game) with more abilities, and speed boost would be amazing imo.  I don't think a cd is nessisary, energy usage would be really interesting (and would allow you to burn their energy intentionally if you suspect they have high templars waiting for your drop)  &gt; 5\. Buff Bio in the late game - with the addition of new units in HotS, we feel Bio in the late game is a bit weak.   Nailed it.  &gt; 6\. Buff mech in general - we'd like to maybe test combining the vehicle and air upgrades at the armory.  Buff yes.  With the trend for an increase in map size this is needed.  Vehicle and air upgrades is sort of odd, as it gives mech a smoother transition into the late game with free viking upgrades to deal with colossus as well as the upgrades needed to transition into sky terran.  Combining upgrades actually shortens to long tech tree of terran, and I don't really see that as a positive.  Of course it helps terran, but from a game design standpoint I am against it.  &gt; 1\. Hydralisk movement speed upgrade to Lair  Expect to see a lot more hydralisks.  This basically makes them viable and deadly in every matchup.  The hard counters to hydralisks (tanks colossus storm) get much less effective with hydralisks move speed.  Roach Hydra or even just pure Hydra is going to be very popular for a very long time.  &gt; 2\. Mutalisk buff to speed and/or acceleration  I am hoping they buff speed.  A buff to acceleration means they react faster and punish bad micro less.  A buff to speed means they just have a straight up buff, and still punish bad micro.  Low acceleration mutalisks is good for gameplay because it forces you to keep your mutalisks moving.  &gt; 3\. Ultralisk changed to be good vs. all ground  We shall see what that means.  It currently is much less effective against marines and zealots than you would think, but appropriately effective against armored targets (they chew through tank lines incredibly fast).  Ultralisks will be a much more effective standard unit if this change goes through, which I see as a good thing from game design standpoint because it offers more stylistic options (like mech vs bio).  &gt; 4\. Nerf Infestor quite heavily  We all saw that coming, makes sense.  &gt; 5\. Make it easier to unburrow and reposition Swarm Hosts  Bad for the game as it punishes bad decisions less, but good for the game as it offers a higher skill ceiling on speed of micro.  I would actually like to see swarm hosts generate locusts slower (or even not at all) when unburrowed.  Right now they don't fill their role of area denial, and are actually more like super long range attacking units.  Blizzard is trying to remove their area denial functionality to give them better micro functionality.  &gt; 1\. Redesign Voidray - we're currently thinking of having the player choose when to activate the charge up ability.  Voidray was a sleep inducing unit, glad to see Blizzard considering the redesign.  &gt; 2\. Oracle - pulsar beam would now overlap too much with the new Voidray, so we'd like to change the Oracle to be more of a worker harasser.  Nooo!  I liked this one, but some interesting worker killing abilities would be ok too.  Maybe blizzard wasn't a fan of 4 oracles flying around the map sniping bases.  &gt; 3\. Buff DTs not necessarily for the DT rush case, but to have DTs more often in the late game.  DT rushes are not very powerful at high levels of play, so that is curious that they would even consider that.  DTs are really powerful in late game, but I admit they could use a buff here.  Good change, DT play had gotten stagnant.  &gt; 4\. Nerf Vortex - we don't like how all or nothing this ability is in Wings, and with new unit adds, we feel we can remove or phase out this ability.  Hooray!  ♥  &gt; 5\. Fix Tempests to not counter all late tech Zerg. We currently don't like how Zerg can't go Tier 3 units if Tempests are in play.  Yes!  Tempests countering swarm hosts and brood lords AND ultralisks was really silly.  Maybe give them a small splash so they are better against broodlords but not as good against ultralisks?  They could even just give them increased damage on air attacks and the unit would be fine (they are supposed to counter carriers and colossus as well)  &gt; 6\. Make Voidray + Phoenix + Oracle combo a viable strat overall.   Pure air armies don't have the limited movement constraints of ground armies.  Making pure air armies viable throughout the entire game is bad because it limits positional options.  I hope Blizzard realizes this before it is too late.  ####8/10 Good effort but not flawless.  Attempts at fixing bad game design choices, but also evidence at continuing the trend to a small degree in the future.",♥

t5_2roqr,Cobalt_Genie,1354582388,"Ok, A few things to start:  Do you want to go by ""Jay"" or ""Jason""?  I would pick one and just be consistent.  In either case, I would try to have one consistent name through out. For example if you want to run this under the company name of ""jaywdesigns"" then, put all the personal stuff about you into an ""about me"" section.  You have a lot of stuff on the home page, that people won't read through and would be better served in its own section.  **about me**  * put this into it's own section, the copy you have now is a bit to long for the home page and it really doesn't need to be there. What you want is something that is *clean* and focuses on the work.  **bottom, lower half**  * no need to repeat the web address, it's just taking up space. * typo on ""copywrite"", should be ""copyright"" * the ""copyright"" line is way too long, a simple **2012 © Jason Williams** — would suffice, if you want to list out where you primarily work, add it to the about us or contact section.  **Graphic Design &amp; Web Design**  * You have some redundancy here, you could just say **Web &amp; Graphic Design**. Whenever possible I would try to avoid repeating the same *word* in the same *line*.  **Design Quote in footer**  * I don't see the need to have this on the bottom of each page, just once would suffice. Personally I'd roll it into the about us section — just a thought.  **Navigation**  * Look at doing one portfolio page where each project is tagged as either graphic or web design. I don't see a wide variety of work that would require you to give everything its own page…  **General Design**  * While the design is clean, I think you may have stuck a little to close to the Skeleton Boilerplate on this. Play around and make it your own…  Hopefully some of this will be of use to you :-)",©

The ones I don't address i either agree with you on, or it's not that big of a deal.  &gt;3. Hellbats better against melee units, not necessarily better vs. Ranged.  They absolutely shred zealots, especially if they have literally any concave. zealots/archon/ immortal/ (air in some situations) is the counter to mech because you have to be mobile in order to counter it. You never want to fight the whole mech army straight on but sometimes you dont get a choice.   I agree with the medivacs. It's a dumb idea. People aren't using medivacs as much because everyone wants to try out new units. It is after all...the beta.  &gt;5. Buff Bio in the late game - with the addition of new units in HotS, we feel Bio in the late game is a bit weak. Nailed it.  I hope to God this was sarcasm. If it's not...then wtf. Why would you encourage someone to stay on tier 1 units late game? Don't tell me they don't have other viable options. If that's the problem, then buff them not bio. That just makes no sense.  &gt;2. Mutalisk buff to speed and/or acceleration  This doesn't need a buff...Mutas are the one of the fastest units in the game, and phoenix being the counter are faster, but only attack air. It seems dumb to buff them seeing as they are already fast as fuck and are dumb to play against as toss. The technical counter to mutas is mass expanding and that's going to be exponentially harder if they are faster.  I don't know enough about ultralisk play but all I know is with insane armor they aren't really that terrible vs zealots.. marines + stim/kiting possibly.  &gt;4. Nerf Vortex - we don't like how all or nothing this ability is in Wings, and with new unit adds, we feel we can remove or phase out this ability. Hooray! ♥  I sense a zerg player. It has been said by almost everyone including literally every caster that the only real counter to late game zerg is the mothership. So unless they bring another viable option (don't even say tempest because that's really not a viable strat/counter) There will be virtually no way to win late game.  &gt;5. Fix Tempests to not counter all late tech Zerg. We currently don't like how Zerg can't go Tier 3 units if Tempests are in play.  This was dumb altogether. Tempests are so bad in direct engagements. corruptors are really good vs them and the swarmhost/corruptor attack is pretty damn hard to stop already. Good luck beating it now.   It's really a lot of unnecessary changes. I feel like these buffs are just trying to keep the peace because they are nerfing somethings (on zerg at least, im not sure what the hells going on with terran)",♥
t5_2qh7f,Funkyjhero,1354593453,"I wouldn't put Splenda in my food either   How Sucralose (aka Splenda) Is Made And Why You Want To Avoid It I wanted to comment on Splenda.  Splenda, also known as sucralose, was created accidentally when some chemists were trying to produce an insecticide.  Here is the process by which they produce the formula sold in stores:  “1.  Sucrose is tritylated with trityl chloride in the presence of dimethylformamide and 4-methylmorpholine, and the tritylated sucrose is then acetylated with acetic anhydride.  2.  The resulting sucrose molecule TRISPA is chlorinated with hydrogen chlorine in the presence of tolulene.  3.  The resulting 4-PAS is heated in the presence of methyl isobutyl ketone and acetic acid.  4.  The resulting 6-PAS is chlorinated with thionyl chloride in the presence of toluene and benzyltriethylammonium chloride.  5.  The resulting TOSPA is treated with methanol in the presence of sodium methoxide to produce sucralose.”  (Note that methanol, wood alcohol aka paint remover,  is one of the questionable ingredients in aspartame.)  In addition, the bags and packets of Splenda commercially available are not pure sucralose.  They also contain bulking agents.  All artificial sweeteners use bulking agents.  Do you know what they use?  Sugar.  Dextrose, sucrose, and maltodextrin.  (Maltodextrin is corn syrup solids composed primarily from fructose and glucose in a starch form.)   All sweetener packets are at least 96 percent sugar.  Splenda is 99% sugar.  The packets are labelled calorie free as a result of manipulating a loophole in the food labeling laws.  The product can be described as sugar free if a serving contains less than 5 grams of sugar, and calorie free if a serving is less than 5 calories.  So they set the serving size on bags at .5 grams  and the packets contain a serving of 1 gram.  A one gram packet contains 4 calories.   This can be confirmed on the manufacturer’s website in the FAQ section:  “Like many no and low calorie sweeteners, each serving of SPLENDA® No Calorie Sweetener contains a very small amount of common food ingredients, e.g., dextrose and/or maltodextrin, for volume. Because the amount of these ingredients is so small, SPLENDA® No Calorie Sweetener still has an insignificant calorie value per serving and meets FDA’s standards for “no calorie” sweeteners. “  To make matters worse, when sucralose was shown to not raise blood sugars, it was the pure substance that was tested, not the mixture that is sold to the public.  Dextrose, sucrose, and/or maltodextrin are definitely going to raise a diabetic’s blood sugar.  There is also a great deal of evidence that artificial sweeteners actually cause an increase in appetite, causing people who consume them to take in more calories than they would otherwise. ",®

I still need to investigate multi tools from Victorinox.  I wrote up some notes, mostly for myself, but then I thought they might possibly be useful for others, so I cleaned them up a tiny bit and am including them here.  (And I really want scissors but I have this major urge to get a Skeletool CX or a OHT.)  Criteria;  * Price - not that big a deal for me, I can afford it and it's money well spent as long as I don't lose it. :-) * Light! (NOTE, Wave is 8.5 oz, for comparison, Pulse is 6, PST/II is 5) * easy to use (so, light, but not tiny, decent sized handles) * One handed opening of at least the main blade, more is better * locking tools/blades - I like blades especially to lock when opened * tool selection - After thinking about what I use on the Wave other than the blade and the pliers, I realized I  MUST have scissors.  The saw is pretty handy too. Corkscrew, awl, file, are nice to have. * I don't care about color much.  Suggestions came from this post on reddit /r/EDC and also from this really really long forum thread I found; ""Best LIGHTWEIGHT multitool???"" http://edcforums.com/threads/best-lightweight-multitool.58082/  1) Leatherman Skeletool CX - the Skeletool is the lightest fullsize, I recall seeing comments on the web or reddit that it is not as sturdy as one might like. The CX blade is made of better steel than the non CX.  One handed opening blade is really easy to use, unlike the Juice blades which are reportedly awkward but possible to open one handed..  One random thing, the carabiner lets you clip it to something momentarily to let you then one handedly open tools (i.e. if your other hand is full).  NO SCISSORS.    Note, the Skeletool and Skeletool CX look to be exactly the same, same set of tools, same size and weight, except for the steel in the blade.  All tools lock.  2) Leatherman OHT - One Hand Tool - I dig the one handed opening concept a ton http://www.leatherman.com/product/OHT 4.5 inch (closed) and 9.9 ozes YIKES heavy - maybe good for camping or whatever, rather than EDC.  $60 to $80 depending on where you get it (REI is $80) having trouble finding it on amazon Wow, lacking tools, considering it's weight, but everything it has is one handed and locking; 420HC Knife, 420HC Serrated Knife, Spring-action Needlenose Pliers, Spring-action Regular Pliers, Spring-action 154CM Replaceable Hard-wire Cutters, Spring-action 154CM Replaceable Wire Cutters, Large Screwdriver (fixed), Medium Screwdriver (fixed), Phillips Screwdriver (fixed), Small Screwdriver (fixed), Saw, Bottle Opener, Can Opener, Integrated Lanyard Attachments, #8-32 Cleaning Rod Attachment, Oxygen Tank Wrench, Strap Cutter.  NO SCISSORS.  3) Leatherman Juice line - C2, CS2, CS4, Xe6  (CS4 has more tools, slightly larger ""The CS4 adds wood saw, corkscrew and awl"") - reddit guys recommended it, meant for carrying in pocket, smaller than a fullsize multitool, from forum ""The best lightweight MT IMO is the LM Juice S2. It has a better tool selection than the Skeletool and it has scissors!""   All of them have 420HC Knife, Needlenose Pliers, Regular Pliers, Hard-wire Cutters, Wire Cutters, Extra-small Screwdriver, Medium/Large Screwdriver, Phillips Screwdriver, Small Screwdriver, Bottle Opener, Can Opener  * Juice C2 - 4.3 oz, Corkscrew w/Assist, * Juice S2 - 4.4 oz, Scissors * Juice CS4 - 5.5 oz, Corkscrew w/Assist, Saw, Awl, Scissors,  * Juice Xe6 - 6.7 oz, 420HC Serrated Knife, Corkscrew w/Assist, Awl, Saw, Diamond-coated File, Wood/Metal File.  Weightier but nice.  Compare with Pulse or PST/II.  4) Leatherman Charge?   Someone on Reddit recommended this, it's 8.2 oz, barely lighter than the Wave/   Charge TTi is the ""lightest full size leatherman tool"" according to forum. Tons of tools. Needlenose Pliers, Regular Pliers, Wire Cutters, Hard-wire Cutters, Crimper, S30V® Knife, 420HC Serrated Knife, Cutting Hook, Saw, Scissors, Wood/Metal file, Diamond-coated file, Large Bit Driver, Small Bit Driver, Medium Screwdriver, Ruler (8 inch/19 cm), Bottle Opener, Can Opener, Wire Stripper, BIT KIT: Phillips #1-2, Screwdriver 3/16"", Screwdriver 1/8"" and Torx #15, Hex 5/32"" and 9/64"", Hex 1/8"" and 7/64"", Hex 3/32"" and 5/64"", Hex 1/6"" and .050"", Square Drive #2 and #3, Phillips Eyeglass Screwdriver and Flat Tip  5) Leatherman Pulse - Buh, wait, I have one of these, it was a gift for being a best man and I loaned it to my brother some time back.  Discontinued so look for it on ebay, but apparently pretty light and small, 5.8 oz, 4 inch when closed,  more tools than the Skeletool and the tools lock. 420HC Stainless Steel Clip-point Knife, 8 in | 20 cm Ruler, Bottle Opener, Can Opener, Diamond-coated File, Extra-small Screwdriver, Hard-wire Cutters, Large Screwdriver, Medium Screwdriver, Needlenose Pliers, Phillips Screwdriver, Regular Pliers, Scissors, Wire Cutters, Wood/Metal File.  I like the form factor on the Wave better.  Partly because of how the handles on the Pulse are designed, the edges kind of bite into my hand.  6) Leatherman Kick - it is 5.2 0z, .2 oz heavier than Skeletool, apparently cheap, has bigger pliers than the medium sized juice pliers.  Looks like it's discontinued. NO SCISSORS. Like a sideclip, minus medium screwdriver and plus wire stripper  7) Leatherman PST/II or Sideclip - (both 5 oz) from forum ""You could also try and find an older PST/II or Sideclip (my all-time favorite Leatherman tool), they are both the same weight as the Skeletool, yet smaller overall with larger pliers.""  PST/II has more tools than sideclip, looks like the sideclip is larger but less stuff.  Sideclip - 420HC Stainless Steel Clip-point Knife, 8 in | 20 cm Ruler, Bottle Opener, Can Opener, Hard-wire Cutters, Large Screwdriver, Medium Screwdriver, Needlenose Pliers, Phillips Screwdriver, Regular Pliers, Small Screwdriver, Wire Cutters. NO SCISSORS. PST/II - same as sideclip plus the blade is partially serrated, and add Scissors, Wood/Metal File, Diamond-coated File  8) Victorinix Swisstool - slimmer versions - suggested by reddit, good quality, lighter than Wave at least.  Went to the website, I'll have to check it out more later, they have a bunch of 5 oz tools, a bunch of 11 oz tools, and a handful that have no weight listed.  HONORABLE MENTION   Leatherman zrex - is not what I want, but it's a $26 strap cutter/window breaker, looks a lot sturdier than the resqme, should get one for the car  Leatherman krunch - too heavy, but neat, looks like locking vise grip style.  Might be awesome for woodworking.  $116 at country knives  Leatherman Piranha - 1.9 oz - super small and neat, this is one of those flat piece of metal things, $35 at country knives, Open Wrench (English), pretty slick.   1/4"" Hex Bit Driver with Phillips/flat bits, Bottle Opener, Scraper, Box Wrench (Metric)   ",®

t5_2qp5l,Robert_Zero,1354601155,"&gt;However, in the congregations I grew up in at least, those who really, truly believed and loved the Truth™ with all their heart were a very small minority. Most seemed absolutely miserable when they weren't trying to keep face  That is possible. My knowledge of the faith is pretty good. But my experience with the social aspects are quite limited. I was the awkward nerdy kid. Didn't fit in anywhere. So I can't say how miserable people are or how widespread general misery is. Although I did notice the face game, the race for piety. And I guess I'm familiar with the phrase you mentioned about learning. Although I hear the same thing from normal people, just without the JW new system twist.  It's hard to know what to feel sometimes. Is it right to feel like everyone would be better off as an atheist? (I personally think so.) Or is it right to tolerate spirituality/faith as long as it's not destructive or contrarian towards life, the universe and other people (sure, why not)? Should we just laugh at creationists, or should we try to help them get a grip? Do we go generally speaking, or case by case.  Maybe I only try to feel bad for people who are trapped and can't leave yet. Or know there's a problem but don't know how to help themselves (yet) and need some advice. I don't feel bad for my sister because there's nothing I can do to convince her to abandon her JW faith, and feeling sorry that she's wasting her life won't help anything.",™

I would guess the average linked list is not used together with HUUUGEStruct pointers and ridiculously large strings, so by default I would assume copying. But you are indeed correct in that whatever behaviour the list exhibits, it should be documented.  The thing about taking a char* and storing a char* is a very compelling argument. I do however not put very much weight to it because there is no other way to represent a string in C, so you sort of have to decide whether you interpret char* as char* or string. In the case of strings, I like to interpret char* as a string.  Naturally, not every linked list must store copies of strings, but I would assume it is The Right Thing™ for an average linked list.",™

In a traditional statistical arrangement you're going to have 1:52 odds every time you pull a card.    But geology doesn't always work like that.  An area with high earthquake risk (Vancouver Canada, for instance) has an active fault line where two tectonic plates are moving against each other.  Except, they're not always actually moving *at* the fault.  So you have one giant chunk of planet wanting to go one way and another wanting to go the other way, both stuck at the middle and not letting the other past.  Static friction, essentially.  But the plates haven't actually stopped.  They're still exerting several trillion tons of pressure in the direction they want to go, and only the friction at the fault is holding up motion.    Back to the deck of cards: because the plates are continually exerting more and more force at the fault, we *know* that eventually the build-up of force will be sufficient to overcome the friction between the plates, and we'll get an earthquake when they shift against each other.    However, we also know that the pressure doesn't *need* to reach that level before the quake: sometimes the fault slips earlier.    At any given day, there is one set of odds that a quake happens.  But we also know that playing the game over the course of geological time is akin to slowly removing cards that are not our Q♠ from the deck: the odds that there will eventually be an earthquake at any fault approach 1.  It is statistically improbable that there will *not* be a quake on a given fault - if we're watching that fault for billions of years.    The concept of ""overdue"" comes not from Gambler's Fallacy or statistics, but pattern recognition.  Taking the Vancouver example, we have geological and archeological records indicating that our fault builds up tension at a rate that results in an earthquake every 600 years (number made up, can't remember the real one).  Now, last time, it was 400, but before that it was 700, but as we increase data points we see an approximate average of 600 years.    And it's been 650 since the last one.  We know there is a fixed pattern present, and while that pattern does not email us a time &amp; date appointment, it's certainly suggesting that the fault is probably close to enough stored energy to slip.

Please read this wonderful story in memory of Tiger sent by his Mommy, Andrea from Tiara Enterprises Inc in Rhode Island that made this beautiful collar for me and her fight to NOT give up on Tiger.  &gt;From Andrea: ""I'll share a little story about ""Sparkles for Hope""........This was an idea I had some years ago, but the timing was not right. I had just purchased my company from my ex husband.....AND, then we saw the first mouse in the factory. UGGHH. Now what?? I went to the Cranston RI animal shelter in search of the biggest, meanest cat I could find. I wanted a mouser. I would adopt a kitten if one chose me, but I was far more interested in a carnivore. I came across this cage at the very end of the cat wall. It was more the size of a dog crate and there was a sign on it that said ""WILD...Maybe, not?"" All of the other cats has their stories on little notecards displayed on the cage. This enormous grey tabby cat with long hair, no wiskers on one side of his face and a chunk missing from his right ear did not. His HUGE green eyes looked at me and he meowed. Ok, I had to know more.  &gt;Tiger's Story is this.......the animal control officer, Pat came over and explained that she watched this cat for a year living in a field behind her sister's house. He would not let you get near him at all. In the middle of winter, and please remember, this is New England....it snows....alot.....she watched Tiger eat coffee grounds from the trash at her sister's house. She knew she had to save him. Tricked by a crafty cage and food inside of it, here was Tiger at the shelter. He was so mean. No one could touch him. He bit, he clawed, he was a wild cat who was frightened and out of his element. Still, Pat said there was something in his eyes. She believed that he could forget the past and fighting with raccoons.  &gt;So, I took the challenge. Tiger could battle my mice. My factory space was in an old mill building where I was one tenant of many. My space was on the second floor and kind of a horseshoe shape. There were enormous windows on the left side of the office that opened up to a rooftop that was like a patio. The building continued on all four sides up three more floors. But the rooftop patio was a great source of light. Tiger spent countless hours out on the roof. He couldn't go anywhere as he was blocked on all four sides by building. But he loved sunbathing and waiting for the less intelligent pigeons to land and then, WOW......the Terminator side of him came out. Tiger weighed 17lbs when I brought him to the office. The next day, after lots of bandaids and layers of protective clothing we were off to the vet for shots. It was there that I learned the most unthinkable......Tiger was feline aids positive. At best, the vet, Dr. McMillan said he would live two years. He called him ""Rambo"" as the skin was so tough on the back of his neck that he snapped the needle for his rabies injection. Too many arguments with other cats and raccoons. It was like leather beneath his fur.  &gt;So, now I'm told, I can put him down if I want.......are you kidding???? He is my Cat now. I'm not putting him down. I promised Tiger on that day......clean kitty litter.....a warm bed with blankets (he LOVED this), and food.....dry always available, water always available, and moist when I got to the office in the morning and right before I left in the evening. Tiger would have to make the factory his only home as I had a cat at home and Feline Aids is transferable to other cats. The first two weeks were awful. Tiger hated me. Every time I walked by my desk......he would lunge out and grab his two paws around my ankle and bite. I was covered in bandaids. His claws were SO sharp. Then one day, I was sitting at my desk working on a project and he jumped up in front of me. We were eye to eye and all I could think of is he was going to lunge and I needed to dial 911.....quickly. As we stared at each other, he took a step forward and flopped down on top of my hands and began to purr. He surrendered on that day.   &gt;I began to learn what Tiger liked. He loved to be carried. His favorite position was slung over my shoulder and in my arms. He loved his ears rubbed. Tiger was a lover. Oh, he would still bite......that's how he got your attention. And then he would just melt into your arms. I began to think that he was at one point ""someone's cat"". He had this odd side to him that even though you were petting him just how he like, he would turn on you and BITE hard!! I think someone just turned him out.  &gt;Some of my clients are Pageant contestants. I work with many state contestants for Miss USA and Miss America who contract me to design jewelry for them. Tiger insisted on being in the middle of the design table. Before I booked appointments, my first question always had to be ""are you aleregic to cats?"" Others are theatrical performers and female impersonators. Tiger didn't care, he had to be in the middle of everything. So, the head of my design team at that time decided to make my Big, Mean, Male Carnivore a rhinestone collar. We started ""Sparkles for Hope"" The Hope that no animal would ever have to be abandoned outdoors and without a home. We started the pet show circuit and a website, but as I said earlier, the timing was wrong. My life could not have a non-profit organization in it when I was fighting to just survive. That was 2000. Tiger lived a wonderful life.............he had good days filled with chasing pigeons on the rooftop to bad days where I had to feed him Tuna to get him to eat. Aids for a cat is just like Aids for a human. One day he just started losing weight........I tried everything that I could think of to do. I cooked him chicken, I went to the Italian butcher and got him duck......he couldnt eat. He grew very thin. But still, even on his last day, he tried to stand up to greet me. He struggled and tumbled. I have Tiger's favorite collar and his picture on my desk. I miss my furry office friend. I still have a cat at my house, but I have never brought another cat to my office.   &gt;Perhaps with Venus's help......Sparkles for Hope will change the lives of shelter cats everywhere. Make owners more responsible to spay and neuter. Let people know LOVE can make a difference. I Loved Tiger alive. He passed in 2009. That was a little more than what was expected.""  &gt;....Thank you Andrea for the gorgeous collars, the inspirational story, &amp; for not giving up on Tiger. I hope sharing this story will inspire others to take risks too. Sometimes all shelter animals need is love, you never know what loyal &amp; loving personality may be lying beneath the fear of being in a cage and/or their past. Thanks again for everything and I hope all my fans enjoyed starting their weekend with a nice story. :) ♥ Venus xoxo",♥

t5_2qimj,jinek67,1354691306,"2008 season took its toll on the development of their 2009 challenger for both Ferrari and Mclaren. IT was a rule change and those 2 teams spent most of their time in creating more upgrades for the car since the championship race was tight and down to the wire. This would be acceptable if there wasn't any major regulation and car specification change but there was and they weren't able to catch on the certain loopholes that they can easily exploit.  I doubt that we would see any major change to the next years car since most of the teams are starting development work on the 2014 specifications. WE would probably see major updates but I doubt that most teams would present an entirely new car designed from the ground up(except mercedes though, since Lauda insisted).  Mclaren had the fastest car but they had major problems in the pits and that proved to be costly for the team. If only they didn't botch those pit stops and if only the car was more reliable. We could have seen Hamilton against Alonso instead of Alonso vs. Vettel.   As far as I'm concerned about their new driver line-up, the only known variable is Button and his consistency which is dependent on the cars balance™. Perez is still an unknown quantity at Mclaren. No one would be sure how he would perform at Mclaren. The only thing we know is he was phenomenal at the start of the season and challenged the leaders on a few races but his last few races were so horrible.  ",™

Don't forget we have SIMI groups and Deccan Mujaheddin and Hurriyats in Kashmir who sympathize with Likes of Qasabs and Afzal Guru's etc.   Also how CD's of Zakir naiks were found in the encounter of the terrorists in Batla house and many other raids regarding possible Terror activities in India. Its just a brief example of what possibly could come in future which already awaits and is lurking eagerly on India's Doorstep.  You remember 26/11?? Well its kind of a joke to talk about it in India, since Indians forget about it cause after 26/11 Mumbai attacks in 2008 there has been at-least 12-15 Terror attacks post 26/11 up-till now. And it seems that nobody bothers untill there is another attack place and then same old drama goes on news channels.  And then there also those Highly intellectuals on Reddit and other places also who would tell you **to go back to sleep there is nothing wrong beta, everything is okay, Islam is Peace, Just ignore him and everything else**  &lt;facepalm&gt;",™

t5_2qh6c,IRBMe,1354721742,"&gt; why do atheists celebrate Christmas  It actually has very little to do with Christianity. Why do you think we put up and decorate Christmas trees? Why do you think we have Yule logs? Why do you think we associate mistletoe with Christmas? Why do you think it's on the 25th of December? What do you think Santa Claus has to do with Christ's birth? I simply ignore the few obviously Christian parts such as Jesus-themed Christmas cards, and it makes very little difference. Why do I do it? For the same reason I eat chocolate eggs and take a day off work at Easter: because it's more of a cultural holiday now than a specifically religious one and eating chocolate, giving gifts and having days off are enjoyable.  &gt; it has the word Christ in it, if they dont believe in god, or jesus, or the holy spirit, they shouldn't be celebrating these holidays  Firstly, why not? Secondly, you seem to have no problem with the names of the days of the week. You don't have to worship Thor to call Thursday by its name. Thirdly, if we said ""*We're celebrating Yule*"" instead of ""*We're celebrating Christmas*"", would it make any difference whatsoever? No. We'd probably just get even more flak from Christians declaring another *War on Christmas!™*",™

Anarchism - even though it, too, is associated with stupid pictures of angsty teenagers in black hoodies, punk music, and molotov cocktails - hasn't undergone the same systematic political antagonism that communism has.

t5_2rfxx,BabrahamDinkin,1354736834,"&gt; That analogy has numerous flaws. For one, he is not employed by riot. He makes a living off of their platform, but they do not own him.   ~~As a player with Dignitas he is part of Riot's team salary system, thus making Riot technically his employer when it comes to Riot sponsored tournaments.~~ EDIT: It seems clear now that Riot's ban on his participation in Riot sponsored events comes from the fact they did not want such a negative player to sign any contracts with Riot. Use of their platform is also supposed to reflect their values as a company in the competitive scene. They have stated multiple times that those on the pro-scene have a responsibility for leading the community by example.  They do not own him, but they own the game, platform, and sponsor the tournaments, so they are well within their rights to ban him from using or participating in any of the above.  &gt; Secondly it is in no way clear that riot warned IWD that his actions would have consequences beyond that of the normal tribunal.  From Riot's ToS:  ""This system of allowing the Community to review user behavior in the Game is called The Tribunal®. Should The Tribunal determine that you have acted in contravention of any one of the Riot Games policies, **Riot Games may, in its sole and absolute discretion, ban your use of the Game and suspend, terminate and/or delete your Account.**""  Needless to say, being banned from competitive play would most likely fall under the category of banning use of the game. While it is not explicitly clear that they have the right ban people from competitions they themselves sponsor, it is common sense to know that Riot has the power to make that determination.  While it has not been made clear to us that he was warned his participation in competitions would be potentially be at risk, it has not been made clear that he was not a warned about this possibility either. With 8 bans/warnings and actually having your negative behaviour increase by 30% past this point, I personally applaud Riot's decision. I just see it as part of the 0.7% of the most toxic players in North America being banned from tournament play as well as regular public play.   A quote from Lyte as well: ""This was a collaboration between eSports and Player Behavior. eSports had multiple meetings and discussions with relevant parties on both sides before they made a decision on the verdict and the timing.""  Hopefully other pro players will note that even if you are a pro, if you give Riot a bad name, then you can be banned from Riot sponsored tournaments.",®

t5_2smsq,Anomander,1354759248,"&gt;wouldn't you need a reeeaaally long window of observation,  We do have a few thousand years...    The geological record means we don't need to have been around and watching the whole time, in order to get data from ages ago.    &gt;What I'm meaning is, that predictions based on observed events in the past could collide with predictions made by probability, right?   No... Because where do you think we're getting those probability numbers from?  The probability of earthquake is exactly that: the odds that there will be an earthquake over [time period] based on all the best information we have.  For instance, if there's a lot of little tremors, that's normally a risk sign for a larger earthquake, so the probability increases to reflect the change.  Now, the probability hasn't necessarily changed, but we have more information to calculate it.    Back to cards: I hand you a pack of cards, and ask you what the odds of pulling that Q♠ are.  ""Easy, that's 1:52.  Obviously.""  But if I give you new information, like ""I left the Jokers in"" or ""I took out all the even numbered cards"" or ""There's two Q♠ in there"" you're obliged to change how you calculate the odds.    The odds haven't necessarily changed, you just have better information to calculate them with.    &gt;In that case, which prediction is more reliable?  None.  It's never a *prediction*.  Predictions are absolute statements, and probability is anything but an absolute.  Let's get back to the Gamblers' Fallacy: it statistics were a *prediction* then the Gamblers Fallacy wouldn't be a fallacy at all, because it's been predicted that you *will* hit jackpot every 101 plays on a game with 1:100 odds.  Instead, probability is telling you what odds are that any specific outcome comes to pass.  You having 1:100 odds means you have 1:100 of winning every time you play, but in no way guarantees or predicts one win per 101 plays.    &gt;couldn't the incidents we're basing our predictions on just be anomalies, e.g. you throw a dice ten times and you get (unlikely but could still happen) 5 times a 6,   Sure, I guess.  But we have a lot more information than just a few dice rolls, and statstics has a few things to adequitely deal with this, among them the concept of a ""statistically sound sample size"" which is the number of data points required to run statstical analysis on the results in order to predict what's known as variance and confidence intervals.    Variance being how widely varied the data points contributing to an average are.  Confidence is a mathematically generated score attempting to predict how likely the results you're getting are going to resemble reality.  I'm not pro stats enough to explain the math itself, but it involves breaking down the sample and then analyzing the chunks against one another to try and solve for the effects of outliers on the actual results.    And ... it's possible we have nothing but outliers in our data set, but much like how deciding to avoid the 99999999999:1 game also indicates you should never leave your house again to be consistent, we're better off taking what we have and using as best we can while being open to revising it as we collect more data than charging in blind and uncaring because our data set *might* be composed of nothing but outliers.

t5_2qh3v,slicksps,1354800165,"Too many posts commenting on the plural so I'll start a new one! Two sides of the Legos/Lego Bricks argument.  1) Lego the brand  Lego is a brand name, it should therefore only ever be ""Lego™"", it is a singular company name, and doesn't describe the items it produces. The plural therefore should be Lego™ bricks, or potentially Lego's™ bricks. There is no such thing as 'a' Lego and therefore cannot be multiple Legos unless another company calls itself ""Lego"" and the two Legos fight over their trademark in court.  2) Evolution of language  Unlike French, German and many other languages, the English language has no body to maintain and develop it. A word becomes an English word not through a decision nor a vote with intellectuals, but by popular usage. If enough people use and accept ""Lego"" to mean the brick, and ""Legos"" to mean more than one, there is nobody to really say that it is wrong. I am allowed to Hoover my house and blow my nose on a Kleenex, even if I have a Dyson and Andrex loo roll. Lol and Gaydar have been added to the official UK dictionaries and while frustrating to purists, is how the English language has, is and will continue to evolve. Get over it!  It pains me therefore to say it, but as Legos is a common derivative and its meaning understood, it can be deemed as 'correct'.",™

She didn't ask you for sex she didn't help into her bed you specifically said you didn't black out until you walk up to her room. Even if you were kicked out of whatever you were with your friend no one was forcing you to walk to marys room. In the morning you woke up reaused you had drunken sex and the. Instead of calling her out for what she did you asked to have sex again. So once again she did not ask or try to force you to have sex. You agreed to have sex with the person who raped you just hours before. After you let her know she raped you she admitted to being wring and even said she would be be fine with you pressing charge™s.

t5_2qm7u,three_dee,1354834185,"&gt;Mazeroski was a below-average batter and had no speed. Smith was a below average batter who had speed. Neither of their offensive stats are HOF worthy. They are ""horrible"" in relation to other HOFers  Smith was not below average, though.  He was one of the best offensive SSs at the time he played.  Which I just demonstrated to you by showing you he had a 99 OPS+ over his 8-year peak, while the highest single season Mazeroski ever had was 97 and had no run of 8 years any higher than 88.  Smith was much better offensively.  &gt;Both were fantastic defensive players. Their defense made up for the total lack of offense, and kept them around for a very long time  Both were great defensive players, but Ozzie was the Greatest Of All Time™.  He has the third best rFLD of any player in MLB history.  And in addition, was also a plus offensive player while Mazeroski was barely replacement level.  There is no comparison here.  Ozzie is a no-brainer selection, first ballot, and Mazeroski is a HOF error made by the VC.  &gt;Mazeroski was involved in one of the most iconic moments in baseball. IT IS FOR THIS MOMENT THAT HE WAS LIKELY ELECTED TO THE HOF  Agreed, he was elected to the HOF for that moment, but that's a shitty way to elect people.

t5_2svvy,zedosan,1354896698,"I meant no offense and at no point did I call you an idiot, but if you look at your original post, it reads like the question of someone who wants others to do their work for them.  Research is arduous, time consuming, taxing, exhausting, and sometimes inconclusive.  I'm not sure of your age, nor does it matter, it just reminded me of my students wanting everything handed over on a platter.  It seems ""research"" has become synonymous with, ""post on a forum and let someone else figure it out.""    Perhaps starting off with, ""Hey guys, so I was just given this TT, but after a week of searches, all I can find is info on 301's, etc.  Anyone have any experience with this table?  Any resources I may not know about?"" That's what I mean.  Show you've made an effort, then others will be more likely and willing to help.    It's like asking a friend to come over and help fix your car, then sitting in the shade drinking a beer while he does all the work.   I know, sometimes you just want an quick answer, but trust me, you'll learn a hell of a lot more if you search for those answers yourself rather than just asking for handouts.  I have a house full of old gear (including an odd model Garrard) who's details have eluded me, but I just keep searching.  You have to weed through the crap to find the gems, but they're there.  Maybe, after finding little bits and scraps scattered around, YOU can be the one to enlighten the Interweb with the most comprehensive collection of AT70 MKII information.  SWEET!  I'll give you the benefit of the doubt that there's nothing to be found out there, so now I'll devote the next 30 minutes of my morning to do your homework:   &gt; The Type A over the RC121 and its newer sibling the RC210, definitely.  The Type A is quieter and has less flutter due to its heavy platter. Its arm is better, being counterbalanced.  The motor has better hum shielding.   If you are going to stack records (and throughout this reply, I am making this assumption, otherwise why buy a record changer?) the pusher platform is gentler and easier on the records than the center push/drop spindle on the RC121. **The A70 and 70 Mk II (same machine, came in two different model numbers)** is an improvement over the Type A. The tonearm's vertical pivots are closer to record level so there is less flutter generated by up/down movements over record warps.  The arm itself is lower in mass though not ""low"" in present terms; more like ""less high.""  The mechanical bits in the automatic trip mechanism are made of low-mass aluminum and low-friction Delrin® instead of steel and thus the trip mechanism works properly to a substantially lower tracking weight, below 1 gram instead of two grams on the Type A. I use a Garrard A70 with a Stanton 500 in the bedroom system, and play my 78s on it with a change of stylus. Disadvantage to the Type A/A70/70 Mk II: the pusher platform won't move inwards enough to stack seven inch records because the heavy cast platter is ten inches in diameter and would block it.  For 7 inch 45rpm records the LRS 3 large-hole center spindle is needed and is often found as a used item.  But without a platform extender, which is so rare that I have only ever seen ONE, these models cannot play stacked seven inch 78s or 33s, with their small spindles, at all.  The RC88 and 88 Mk II could do it, since they only had a seven-inch steel platter, but you give up the better tonearm and heavy platter. [Source](http://www.lencoheaven.net/forum/index.php?PHPSESSID=d65iv37j6tifi2lc0d1njujud4&amp;topic=3650.msg57204#msg57204)   Interesting... Let's read on!  &gt;The 70 Mk II was the last Garrard to have the famous Garrard-patented pusher platform record changing mechanism. **It is nearly identical to the Type A70 (only the center nameplate, the model number emblem, and a white arrow on the headshell distinguish it from the A70) and is directly descended from the Type A**, which Garrard touted, with great commercial success, as ""the first Automatic Turntable."" By now, all these units are old; the 70 Mk II dates from 1966, the Type A70 from 1964, and the Type A from 1960. Typically, all of these models are prone to a stuck automatic mechanism, caused by the main operating gear/cam freezing to its shaft due to the old grease drying out and hardening. I've found from long experience that it's not all that difficult to fix the problem, by undoing the hex nut that holds the shaft in place on the unit's chassis, heating the gear/cam gently with a small propane torch to soften the hardened grease, and pushing the shaft out the bottom. All the rest of the mechanism stays in place! This allows the dried grease to be cleaned out with solvent. New synthetic grease was used to relubricate the parts before reassembly. There are dozens of other places where old grease needs to be cleaned out, but by comparison they're much easier to do with some of that same solvent and a pile of cotton swabs. Some attention with a needle oiler got some new oil to the motor bearings; I'd see whether the motor would need overhaul later. The center bearing always needs to be checked out on a turntable this old. There was evidence that it had been serviced in the past: out of the original five 3/32"" steel balls in the bearing race, only three were present! It is easy to lose these when servicing the bearing on these models, and apparently somebody had done just that. Fortunately there is a nearby hobby store, selling supplies for building radio-controlled model cars, and they stock those steel balls. It took a half hour to go there, chat with the owner a while, and come home with a little plastic bag containing a dozen 3/32"" steel balls. The idler wheel was in good shape (nobody had let the turntable sit in the ON position while it was unplugged, so no flat spots) and just took a bit of cleaning and a swipe with a rubber drive conditioner. With the platters (the inner steel drive platter and the outer, heavy cast alloy platter) set into place, the moment of truth had come. Powered up and running for probably the first time in decades, the 70 Mk II went through its paces flawlessly. When cold, the speed was about 0.2% fast; when warmed up, it was about 1.2% fast (Garrard's standard was 1% fast to allow for slowdown as a stack of records is played, so this is close enough) so the motor is OK. Tomorrow, I'll listen to some records, with a Stanton 500E. I already use a Garrard Type A70 in my bedroom system (Fisher 800B AM-FM-MPX receiver, Snell K2 loudspeakers), so the 70 Mk II is familiar to me. But it's always a thrill to rescue something like this from decades-old nonoperation, making it as good as it was when it departed the factory in Swindon, Wiltshire, England. Maybe a smidgen better; the modern grease I put in there won't dry out like that old stuff. It is unlikely that the main gear/cam will freeze up again, even after another forty-five years. [Source](http://www.lencoheaven.net/forum/index.php?topic=7289.0)  [This guy would also be a good person to ask](http://www.vinylengine.com/turntable_forum/viewtopic.php?p=293487&amp;sid=fa0b1bdd6652de2dd5e62495cc998801#p293487): &gt;The TYPE A70 was the upgraded Type A and was a much superior unit. Unfortunately Vinyl Engine does not have a service manual for the Type A or Type A70 (or the identical, two-years newer 70 Mk II) in the library. In fact they don't have the owner's manual for the Type A70/70 Mk II. Maybe I should scan mine and send it to them!    [Here's a guy that's rebuilding an A MKII](http://www.vintage-radio.net/forum/showthread.php?t=64247), you can try PM'ing him and pick his brain.  [Here's an interesting tidbit:] (http://www.lencoheaven.net/forum/index.php?topic=3650.msg59842#msg59842) &gt;The idler's rubber may be aged and have hard spots.  Not even turning it and truing the surface will fix that.  Garrard quit making that particular idler wheel in the late 1960s when the **A70 (later, the identical ""70 Mk II"" model)** was discontinued, though supplies of new ones were available for many years.  So I guess that means that the A70 manuals should be able to help you with your MKII.  There's the [service manual for the A70](http://www.vinylengine.com/library/garrard/model-70.shtml), which should at least give you some insight into the proper setup and functionality.  [There's also the Garrard Guide to Automatic Turntables.](http://www.vinylengine.com/library/garrard/garrard-guide.shtml)  [Yet another VE post about your table.](http://www.vinylengine.com/turntable_forum/viewtopic.php?p=118860#p118860)  Well, your 30 minutes are up.    **EDIT: Nice looking table by the way. I've always loved the Garrard's suspension system.  I always wished my SL-95B had the wooden plinth, alas, it's plastic.  It runs a bit fast, but I'm only missing the 7"" automatic feeder.  Once I can get to the service manual and give it some love, it'll become my 7"" jukebox.  TT's are like Lay's chips,  you can never have just one. ;)",®

How they say it though is rather distasteful.  The thing is that SRD has absorbed a substantial population that has very little interest in drama. When ASRS was shuttered amongst other events it seems like a lot of their posters flocked here. Which sort of makes sense. SRS causes a lot of drama, and therefore is discussed here frequently. The problem is the ASRS crowd was more interested in spewing crazy about how one of the admins must be fucking an SRS mod because of how biased they are against FREE SPEACH™.

What Sega needed for the Dreamcast was a smash hit game, either an in house or from a third-party game company.  The hardware was capable of plenty, just slightly less powerful than the PS2. It had to be a game that brought over friends, classmates, neighbors, whoever - the way Halo did for Xbox. Again, it had the hardware to run a demanding game. Plus it had four controller slots.  Failing that, it needed an epic adventure game with an iconic character. Maybe one that could hide himself in a box to evade detection or a pointy eared boy with an annoying sidekick that would constantly beckon you to, HEY LISTEN.  There were plenty of great games on the DC, and if you play them today, they're still fun. But lacking that smash hit, the Dreamcast was facing certain death. Even with it's lackluster release games, Sony's PS2 sent the Dreamcast to the emergency room.

t5_2qkli,nozafc,1354974095,"Scotland should be independent  By Alex Salmond, Saturday, December 8, 12:59 AM  The writer is the first minister of Scotland.  When the United Nations was formed at the end of World War II, its membership comprised barely 50 independent countries. Today that number has grown to almost 200 — a sure sign that the right to democratic self-determination has been among the foremost prevailing factors in the world as we have moved into the 21st century.  And the voice of the United States has often been instrumental in that process.  As first minister of Scotland, I lead a country that once was independent and aspires to that status again. In autumn 2014, we will offer the people of Scotland the opportunity to vote to reclaim that independence.  As part of the debate in the run-up to that referendum, it is important that the facts are laid out as clearly as possible, and that is why The Post’s Oct. 31editorial [“If Europe crumbles; An independent Scotland would be bad for the West”] was so disappointing.  To begin with, the assertion that an independent Scotland would “withdraw from NATO” is quite wrong. The Scottish National Party voted this year for an independent Scotland to continue in NATO membership. Independence will certainly mean an end to the stationing of nuclear weapons in Scotland, that is true, but this will merely put Scotland in the same non-nuclear category as 25 of the alliance’s current 28 members.  The claim that an independent Scotland would be “unable to contribute meaningfully to global security” also is untrue. Would the same be said of European nations such as Norway, smaller than Scotland, or Denmark, almost identical in size? As it happens, these two countries combined flew more air sorties in the internationally sanctioned action in Libya than did the United Kingdom.  Further, the assertion that London might veto independent Scottish membership of the European Union and its use of the pound as a currency is not borne out by the facts. The recent Edinburgh Agreement, signed by myself and U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron, commits both our governments to respect the referendum and to implement the outcome, whatever the result.  And it is likely that any London government would be keen to see an independent Scotland continue to use the pound, given the large sums that Scottish sources — not least North Sea oil and gas, the vast majority of which lies in our territorial waters — make to that currency’s balance of payments.  Scotland and the United States share close ties stretching back centuries. Many U.S. presidents trace their ancestry to Scotland, while the Declaration of Arbroath, the 14th-century document asserting Scotland’s status as an independent nation, has been held by a U.S. Senate resolution as a direct influence on the U.S. Declaration of Independence.  The long-standing ties between our two countries will only be strengthened once Scotland regains its place as an equal member of the global family of nations. After all, the Republic of Ireland gained its independence in the 20th century and enjoys the warmest of relationships with the United States. Does anyone in the United States seriously consider that this relationship would be improved by seeing Dublin return to rule from London?  Former president Bill Clinton recently recognized that it is increasingly important for national identities to be accommodated along with the need to make common cause to tackle global problems. Independence in an interdependent world means that the 21st century can see just such a global partnership evolve hand in hand with the political self-determination of which the United States has so often been such a vociferous champion.  Indeed, in considering the true interests of the United States, perhaps The Post would do well to reflect that democracy and self-determination must by their nature represent the real interest of America, because they are the core principles on which the country was founded.  There is something else worth reflecting on in the Scottish civic debate. In a process of self-government that has taken the best part of the last century, not one person has ever died arguing for or against Scottish independence.  The national movement in Scotland is peaceful, democratic and civic in its nature — something perhaps, in this troubled world, to be encouraged as in the true interests of both the United States and of Scotland.

t5_2s7tt,yetkwai,1354979341,"Uh, what are these atheist symbols you speak of? I mean you don't believe in anything, so why would you have symbols?  Religion just sort of gets absorbed into our culture. There's a lot of symbols we use that are derived from now dead pagan religions that we still use. Really, the Christmas tree is one of those. It got absorbed into our culture and then later it got absorbed by Christians from our culture.   Is the heart symbol a religious symbol? Should it be prohibited from all government property? It originated from pagan religions. Not many people believe in those religions any more though. Is saying I ♥ you, a religious statement?  Of course not. No one gives a fuck about that anymore. If someone displays ""I ♥ NY"" in a New York government office, no one thinks of it as displaying a religious symbol in a government office. Even though technically it is. But since no one believes in the religions that held that symbol to have a religious meaning no one cares.  So why do atheists care about symbols of religions they don't believe in being displayed? Nobody cares about a ♥ being displayed because they don't believe in that religion. Why would you care about the symbol of a religion you don't believe in being displayed? Why does it offend?  This sort of behaviour indicates that some atheists aren't simply non-believers, they are actually anti-religion, and more specifically, anti-christian. They care about it only because christians care about it. They don't protest something like I ♥ NY for using a religious symbol because christians don't care about it. They are essentially trolling christians. And then wonder why christians don't like them.",♥

Examples will come very soon. The hope is that the community will really innovate with these tools and improve the way the game is played and watched.  * The Map Editor will see UI improvements, particularly to the Data Editor which will hopefully be less of a clusterfuck. The goal is to improve the useability for less-experienced mapmakers and help them create the stuff they really want to make.  * Resume from replay feature. Referees can decide where the game will resume from. Allows you to enter pro replays and play from a certain point with a friend (and although not mentioned, presumably with the AI too.) This could be great for say... emulating epic moments from pro games or improving micro without specialised maps.  * Newer UIs will help guide newer players. A revamped Training Mode is coming soon that will explain a tonne of the game concepts. This will help people who are accustomed with the Campaign Mode and who jump into the vastly different multiplayer mode for the very first time. It will start as a comprehensive tutorial, then give you AI games to test your skill level. The hierarchy intended by Blizzard will be Tutorials -&gt; vs AI -&gt; Unranked -&gt; Ranked.  * The XP system is designed to give you XP for stuff you killed or built and the stuff you had left (or your opponent had left if you beat him.)  * Blizzard was restaffed significantly after WoL wanting to really improve the game. This is especially the case for battle.net 2.0's features and the map editor.  * Blizzard wants to resolve ladder anxiety by easing the playerbase into the game through revamped help/tutorial systems. They believe the sudden ""HOLY SHIT THE GAME IS REALLY HARD"" barrier is what's deterring a lot of new players from getting into the game.  * Dustin Browder would rather fight 100 Ultralisk-sized Zerglings than 1 Zergling-sized Ultralisk.",™

t5_2rjli,Teenager_Simon,1355018095,"You're in a shitty situation.  I'm sure I can find a solution to clear it up.  ---  First off, every household needs a plunger. So get one later.  For now- here's some tips from reddit.  ----  [YSK how to unclog your toilet without a plunger.](http://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/12i7tj/ysk_how_to_unclog_your_toilet_without_a_plunger/)  1. Fill a bucket with hot water.  2. Squirt generous amounts of dishwashing liquid into the toilet bowl. You can also chop a bar of soap into small pieces and place it in the toilet bowl.  3. Carefully pour the hot water into the toilet bowl to dissolve the liquid or bar soap. The soap should quickly begin to unclog the toilet drain by helping the clogged object start sliding down the pipes.  4. Repeat the process, if necessary. When the water in the toilet bowl goes down, the blockage has been dislodged.  5. Flush the toilet a few times after it's unclogged to remove any residue.  -------  [How To Unclog a Toilet With No Plunger, No Wire Hanger, No Auger, and No Drain Snake HOTEL EDITION](http://www.reddit.com/r/howto/comments/sxuxs/how_to_unclog_a_toilet_with_no_plunger_no_wire/)  1. Allow water in bowl to recede to it's lowest level  2. Take ice bucket bag (where provided) and insert your hand inside it.  3. Unwrap plastic drink cup (if wrapped in plastic) and insert your gloved or ""bagged"" hand inside the plastic wrapping down to the bottom of the cup so that two or more of your knuckles are touching the bottom.  4. Take the top of the ice bag ""glove"" and hold it tight against your arm with your free hand (if available, try using a rubber band, scrunchie™ or hair tie to achieve the same effect in order to leave this hand free)  5. Insert cup into the toilet drain (hole) with a firm grip inside the cup and with the makeshift ""glove"" still on, and mimic plunging actions (thrust cup in, thrust cup out) into the drain repeatedly. Try to insert the cup flush with the drain so as to create adequate pressure towards the obstruction. The cup will likely bend against the inside of the drain but try to maintain it's shape as much a possible by experimenting with the way you hold the cup (fist, knuckles, etc.)  6. Repeat until you see the remaining water recede and/or hear the ubiquitous ""gurgle,"" denoting that the blockage has been removed.  -----------  Good luck.",™

t5_2qh1u,BioGenx2b,1355034575,"Context is absolutely important here:  ##tl;dr **We royally pissed South Korea the fuck off.**  __________________________ ###♦ Outskirts of Seoul, Morning of June 13th, 2002 ♦  Two schoolgirls walking along a narrow roadside are run over by an American military vehicle during a training exercise. The Status of Forces Agreement defines it as a ""military operation"" and thus puts the case's jurisdiction with American military courts. Two service members involved in the accident are later acquitted of negligent homicide, citing no criminal intent. Families of the deceased are paid civil damages by the American government.  Shortly thereafter, thousands of protestors rally in the streets, demanding that they be re-tried in a Korean court. Months of protests and Washington's subsequent refusal, Korean sentiment declines heavily into anger over American policies giving sole jurisdiction of U.S. military-related crimes on South Korean soil to the United States.  PSY, along with the rest of his country, are in almost unanimous protest against the U.S. Businesses are banning Westerners, U.S. flags placed on the ground in college campuses so that students can walk over them during their commutes. _______________________________________________________  ###♦ Excerpt from Korea Times, December 5, 2002 ♦  `""Following the acquittals of two U.S. soldiers from negligent homicides charges late last month, a growing number of local celebrities have offered their heart-felt sympathy with the victims in public, while expressing their strong resentment over what they see as an unfair ruling by the American military court.`  `These public figures have composed protest songs against America to pitch in their voice, join public rallies, or have gone as far as calling for revision of the Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA), which governs the status of 37,000 American troops stationed here, through official statements.`  `Even though these pop stars have managed to put in their own two cents' worth, pop vocalist PSY, who has upheld the cause since August through many concerts, is among the most outspoken of them all.""`  South Korean protests eventually succeed, as the American military eventually amends SOFA, allowing Korean courts to take U.S. servicemen in custody prior to trial. _______________________________________________________  ###♦ Iraq, May 22, 2004 ♦  The Islamist group Jama'at al-Tawhid wal-Jihad kidnaps Korean Christian missionary Kim Sun-il, ransoming his life in the demand that South Korea cancel plans to send 3,000 more troops to support the U.S. and withdraw their ~900 medics and engineers currently occupying the region. Seoul refuses negotiations and Kim is subsequently beheaded. The video of the act is accompanied by the following statement:  `""Korean citizens, you were warned, your hands were the ones who killed him. Enough lies, enough cheatings. Your soldiers are here not for the sake of Iraqis, but for cursed America.""`  This sparks massive protests throughout the country with thousands rallying against Muslim extremists and Seoul's plans to send troops to Iraq. This public outrage is the perfect environment in which a number of anti-U.S. military protestors seize the momentum to put forth their cause.  PSY, along with several other popular performers, take part in a live performance of K-metal band N.EX.T's song ""Dear American"".  _______________________________________________  *Source*   [Exclusive: PSY`s Anti-America Protesting Past?](http://busanhaps.com/article/exclusive-psys-once-passionate-protesting-past)",♦

Amazingly, Kerouac and Watts were alcoholics and drank themselves to death, something Mel managed to pull out of. He has a kid and is still writing and doing his thing and being the model of Zen - meaning he's mellow and sort of a punk but really sincere about it.  Oh, and me. Everything in my life that seemed like a problem just faded away once I stopped. I used to have a really OCD 'getting things done' style set of lists. Next Actions, Projects, Responsibilities, and at the farthest end, Dreams. I sobered up since the last time I looked at it, looked at it recently and saw that most of my projects were way more pain and work than they'd ever be worth, and, quite surprisingly, I'd accomplished my single Dream entry.

t5_2qh61,johnbentley,1355065487,"You are getting wrong advice.   Edti: I'm not a Doctor ....  Do not apply any creams (excepting hydrogels such as Burnaid).  The standard treatment is the same for any other burn: 20 minutes of running cold tap (or shower) water. This is effective if applied up to 3 hours after the burn and it will effect considerable reduction in healing times. This treatment is always more effective than hydrogels.  Just be sure not to give yourself hypothermia.   If the burn is really bad then loosely wrapping the burn, after cold water treatment, in cling wrap prevents infection and offers some pain relief (keeping the air off the wound).  Sources: Australian Red Cross First Aid Manual 2010; [Cuttle L &amp; Kimble RM, First aid treatment of burn injuries, 2010](http://www.awma.com.au/journal/1801_01.pdf).  Edit. Cuttle L &amp; Kimble on Aloe Vera (and hydrogels) specifically:  &gt; Aloe vera as either the leaf pulp directly from the plant (Figure 2) or a gel treatment containing the pulp is another commonly applied alternative dressing used by the public for burns. Previously, the published data on trials of Aloe vera treatment suggest that it would possibly be of more benefit for superficial burns, rather than deep burns. That opinion is supported by our research, as we found that that the application of Aloe vera for 20 minutes provided no beneficial healing for deep porcine burns. As most people continually apply Aloe vera pulp for several hours post-burn, it is possible that a longer application may have provided some healing benefit, however the main effect of alternative treatments such as Aloe vera and Burnaid® appears to be their ability to reduce or eliminate pain, rather than improve wound healing.",®

They throw themselves at you, they get naughty, they even get inappropriate.  I can't wear my kilt, unless I want to be the centre of attention. But when I do, oh man, the women want you and the men want to be you.  Just be prepared for The Question™. Have an answer or two pre-prepared, you will get it a lot. My standard answer is an arch look followed by ""How warm are your hands?"" Always gets a great response, sometimes gets a non-verbal, literal answer to the rhetorical question.  And YSK that you don't have to be Scottish/Celtic to wear a kilt. You really don't. While the rental places will just have the classic tartans, you can think about getting your own tartan that speaks to you. The official Scottish Tartan Registry has thousands of officially recognized tartans from around the world. Just about every city in the world has its own tartan, likewise for states, universities, countries, sports teams, families, etc.  The Wong family tartan is one of my favourites, [Vancouver's ""Toddish McWong"" has one of his own and wears it to great effect](http://www.gunghaggis.com).  Everybody can wear a kilt that speaks to them, that means something to them. While every kilt-wearer will regularly be asked ""are you Scottish?"", you then have an interesting, revealing story to tell about something you care about, a story that will only be more endearing to any woman who asks.  **TL;DR: Kilts man, kilts.**  Edit: Check out the inimitable [scotweb.co.uk](http://www.scotweb.co.uk/tartan) and search for a tartan that speaks to you (city, region, last name, sports team, language, country, etc). See also [Tartan Ferret](http://www.tartansauthority.com/tartan-ferret/) and [Tartan Finder](http://www.houseoftartan.com/house/tfinder.htm) among others.  Edit 2: If there's enough interest, I'd be happy to do an AMA. Not so much to impart my prescriptive advice, but as a collaborative source of Kilt-wearing information!",™
t5_2qh3p,W_Edwards_Deming,1355080733,"Thank you for the link to the research.   I would point out that:  &gt;The Orgasm Survey is sponsored by SPM Ltd, manufacturers of the PelvicToner™    I cannot seem to find any methodology, and am confident this was not peer-reviewed research. They do seem to mention Alfred Kinsey, famous today for the poor quality of his research. I did find this however:  &gt;The 2007 Durex Global Sex Survey compared various aspects of sex from around the globe and found that women climaxed less than men, with 32 percent saying they reached the peak every time they had sex, compared with 63 percent of men. It did not distinguish the type of orgasm.  While conducted by another business (in this case a condom company) and unlikely to have been peer-reviewed, this suggested that 32% or women orgasm *every* time they have sex.   They also say:  &gt;Primary orgasmic dysfunction, wherein the woman has never experienced an orgasm, appears to characterize about 10% to 15% of women. Surveys generally suggest that somewhere between 33% to 50% of women experience orgasm infrequently and are dissatisfied with how often they reach orgasm. Performance anxiety is believed to be the most common psychological cause of orgasm problems.  So this makes clear that by their own account, at least half the women experience orgasm frequently or are satisfied with how often they reach orgasm. A third sounds about right to me. ",™

Come morning you look into eachother's eyes and say ""I adore you!"" Then he goes and makes you a gourmet breakfast! Whew girl that would be so great!  With this guy though...that is Never Going to happen. He is too selfish, inexperienced and immature to give a woman what she needs.  Every woman should experience a fantastic lover.

They are trying to say that the plural should be 'Lego' because the company said not to use 'Legos.' ""See!! It's right there in print."" But the thing that they ignore is that the company told people to refer to them as 'Lego bricks or toys.' The mention of the plural being 'Lego' does not exist from that letter except in crude interpretations of it. The one thing that letter does prove is that the term 'Legos' has been used as the plural for Lego bricks for years decades now as the company recognized it. But what that letter did say was to refer to them as 'Lego bricks and toy', so the real correct plural of the term is 'Lego bricks.'  But like I said, I'd recognize both versions as they are both really not correct in a formal sense of the term, but both seemingly acceptable in informal circles.   edit: Actually I was wrong, the correct plural is actually 'LEGO bricks and toys.'

I also love reading about his inspirations, somehow it's always art that I already love (Butoh dancing, German expressionism), and then going back to the clothes and identifying all the elements. His haute couture stuff is gorgeous, I would live in that if I could, that being said, somehow I feel it doesn't translate so well to RTW, or rather it's been hit or miss for me. It's hard to explain, but I feel like toning it down loses a bit of the vision. I actually quite like the last 2 RTW collections, but I still can't get over those hideous animal faces from fall 2011.",♥

t5_2sgq6,Axius,1355172596,"It only works because others like EA and Activision tell you that this year, they're releasing Lollipop 2012. In a few weeks they'll announce Lollipop 2013 with a very slight change to the recipe. After all, you really enjoyed Lollipop 2012, so why change it? Although some people who thought it was a bit too sweet have requested a little less sugar in the mix next time, or that's what market research has indicated should be done to sell more next time. Accessibility, you see! The more people who buy Lollipop 2013, the better it will make Lollipop 2014.  Seeing excitement at possibilities reminds you of what it was like to first power up the original Playstation and see all these 3D graphics. Everything was so new. Developers took risks to see how far they could push the console, and the 32-bit era was characterised with a lot of the franchises we're still seeing sequels for today.  Now everyone is getting lazy. We want Molyneux to be right because we know there's got to be something new out there. In all likelihood, he won't be leading us to it with intent. He probably never did in the first place. Chances are he's always been this way and the community has taken to defining its own pioneers today. Gabe Newell for example with Half Life.  I don't expect The Best Game Ever™. I don't expect to lose my life to any games he brings out. I do expect that he tries to achieve everything he says, because if he didn't mean it, it would be the worst PR ever for him to continue doing it when he knows he can't. He doesn't seem like the PR spin type that says these things to sell a game, he does seem to genuinely believe they're possible. That for me is a crucial difference.  Listen to what he says, believe that he wants what he says but don't expect it to happen. Just be glad that someone is pointing out that gaming can go so much further than most of the industry is letting it. We just need to wait until someone comes along that can fix it.",™

t5_2qnwb,computerpsych,1355176591,"There is plenty of information on Google about this. I recently found out that Ritalin was not affected by Vitamin C, just Adderall.   **Drugs.com says**  &gt;Avoid drinking fruit juices or taking vitamin C at the same time you take amphetamine and dextroamphetamine. These can make your body absorb less of the medicine. Read more at http://www.drugs.com/mtm/adderall.html#2KVvP2QBuSxkTVss.99   ***  From wikipedia-  &gt; Urinary and stomach pH levels can have a strong effect on DL-amphetamine excretion and absorption.[28] An acidic stomach and GI pH will decrease the absorption of Adderall,[12] and acidic urine levels will decrease the reabsorption of the drug through the renal system.[29] Co-administration of acidic substances (e.g., citric acid) causes decreased renal reabsorption of DL-amphetamine; whereas, alkaline agents (e.g., antacids) may cause a marked increase in renal tubular reabsorption. The increased reabsorption can increase the retention of amphetamines, with potential to result in dangerously high serum levels.[29]  *** **This is from the FDA website (posted in a blog)**  &gt;Drug Interactions:  &gt; **Acidifying agents** -Gastrointestinal acidifying agents (guanethidine, reserpine, glutamic acid HCl, ascorbic acid, etc.) lower absorption of amphetamines.  &gt;**Urinary acidifying agents**-These agents (ammonium chloride, sodium acid phosphate, etc.) increase the concentration of the ionized species of the  amphetamine molecule, thereby increasing urinary excretion. Both groups of agents lower blood levels and efficacy of amphetamines.  &gt;**Alkalinizing agents** -Gastrointestinal alkalinizing agents (sodium bicarbonate, etc.) increase absorption of amphetamines. Co-administration of ADDERALL XR® and gastrointestinal alkalinizing agents, such as antacids, should be avoided. Urinary alkalinizing agents (acetazolamide, some thiazides) increase the concentration of the non-ionized species of the amphetamine molecule, thereby decreasing urinary excretion. Both groups of agents increase blood levels and therefore potentiate the actions of amphetamines  Here is a list of foods containing vitamin C listed on the blog (linked below)  Oranges – juice or fruit Grapefruit – juice or fruit Strawberries Papaya Kiwi fruit Mango Cantaloupe Lemons/lemonade Limes/limeade  Potatoes (this is not a misprint) Brussels sprouts Broccoli Kale Cauliflower (who knew?) Parsley Mustard greens Bell peppers  Source: http://www.addiva.net/2009/06/21/adderall-vitamin-c-interaction/  ***   * Coffee might not affect the absorbtion but it will stack and give people an extra jittery feeling.   * The juice is not the problem. It is the Vitamin C in the juice.   * **You should also avoid drinking pop within 1-2 hours before/after taking Adderall because it can have citric or phosphoric acid.**  * **People taking a multivitamin should take it later in the day instead of morning because these usually have &gt;100% daily vitamin C.**  ***  *I really wish people did more research before posting questions on /r/ADHD and include more information in the OP when asking a question. I am all for helping people, but it seems like people are taking advantage of the helpful members and expecting us to do all the research. This was all new information that I searched for just now.*",®

t5_2tf60,BolshevikMuppet,1355188245,"&gt;You first said someone would have to stop all piracy to run an experiment which I presume you understand is impossible  If your argument is that piracy has a net positive effect on digital sales, the proper experiment would be to compare purchases with and without piracy.  A need to stop piracy for some period of time for some number of people would be necessary.  Though, then you'd have the problem of not having a blind study.  So, it'd be difficult to quantify it either way.  &gt;proceed to explain to my about why any evidence I give you will fall into one of three categories you have prejudged as not good enough  Prejudice isn't *quite* the right word.  It is meant for someone who has come to a conclusion before being presented evidence.  Given that all of your evidence falls into one of three categories any statistician would say ""yep, that's not good evidence"" to, it's not prejudice to communicate that to you.  &gt;Your premise is founded on equally shaky ground  I have made no claims, only responded to yours.  If your position was ""it has no harm nor any benefit"" I would not be able to quibble (I'd point out that there's a staggering amount of piracy of things like the humble indie bundle, but admit that there's no way to prove they *would have* bought it if they had to).  And if your position was ""we can't know the effect"" I would kiss you on the mouth.  You made the claim it was a benefit, a claim that requires some basis.  &gt;Paraphrasing? Really? After your demand for empirical evidence?   Yes, paraphrasing.  If you doubt that Mr. McCartney actually said it, I'd be happy to find sources for you, but I decided to spend more time writing substantively and less time googling the exact phrasing.  You seem to mistake ""lack of exactness about a quotation"" for ""OMG it's not empirical.""  Here's a tip: anecdotes are not data.  I was giving an example which you (wrongly) quibbled with.  &gt;despite that they made little money they continued to make music  Again, Paul McCartney would quibble:  ""we'd be idiots to say that it isn't a constant inspiration to be making alot of money. It always is, to anyone. I mean, why do big business tycoons stay big business tycoons? It's not because they're inspired at the greatness of big business; they're in it because they're making alot of money at it. We'd be idiots if we pretended we were in it solely for kicks. In the beginning we were, but at the same time we were hoping to make a bit of cash. It's a switch around now, though, from what it used to be. We used to be doing it mainly for kicks and not making alot of money, and now we're making alot of money without too many kicks... except that we happen to like the money we're making.""  (Beatles Ultimate Experience: Playboy Interview With The Beatles. Interviewed by Jean Shepherd in Edinburgh. Copyright © 1965 Playboy Press).  &gt;As an artist and someone that knows hundreds of artists that, while trying to make money never really do but keep making music nevertheless, I can assure you it isn't their bottom line which drives them  And how many of your acquaintances have a big problem with their art being pirated?  If your argument is ""OMG disseminate art"" apparently it doesn't apply to what's being pirated, because most of what's being pirated is created by business.  &gt;A businessman really is about money, whereas, the artist really is about their art.  Your fetishization of the artist as one who works solely for the love of art is defied by almost any artist you can name.  Michelangelo, Leonardo Da Vinci, and Donatello were not starving artists.  They were artists working for their patrons, the Medici.  Are there artists working solely for the joy of creation?  Absolutely.  Is most of the art being pirated made by such people?  No.  &gt;The speculation is that Shakespeare was written by someone who who funded themselves by writing popular plays. Shakespeare wasn't popular commercially, it was art and culture, and became popular much later.  Speculation by whom?  Because that goes against all of the history I've ever read, and I've read quite a bit about Elizabethan England.  &gt;All these things begin with someones single artistic vision  Really?  You believe that one morning Joss Whedon said ""I have a damned good idea for an Avengers movie?""  No.  He was hired to write a script and direct a movie.  And the actors were hired, and the production staff was hired.  That's usually how it goes.  Some really big names can get their pet projects funded, but that's for the James Camerons of the world.  Go survey some filmwriters to see how many get to just write until someone realizes their idea is ""the next big thing"" and how many get paid by studios who have an idea and need a script.  Transformers: Dark of the Moon was not a single artistic vision from an aspiring artiste.  They hired someone to write a script for a movie they were already making.  Pirates of the Caribbean was not an artistic vision, it was Disney deciding to make a movie based on the ride.  The Dark Knight was kind of an artistic vision, but it was the *studio* saying ""hey, would you like to direct this"" which goes against your whole ""it starts with the artist and then goes to the company"" shtick.  &gt;it got shut down because the music industry couldn't compete and could no longer control what people listened to and what they liked thereby  That's not quite what happened.  Even the ""OMG it was awesome for indie artists"" recounting of it on [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MP3.com) explains it quite differently than ""it was destroyed by the evil record labels.""  If you have some source for that, I'd be happy to see it.  &gt;I will, along with many other artists, produce as much free competing content as possible to damage the industry as much as possible  Except that's not piracy.  If your method of destroying the RIAA or MPAA was to make competing content and become more popular, that's fine.  But right now I'm not seeing ""OMG independent artists are bringing them down and taking their profits.""  I'm just seeing piracy.  &gt;since I cannot earn anything I will give it for free in the hope I destroy as much of the industry as possible  So, because your music isn't something people want, you want to make it that no one gets paid for their music?  That's just bitter, man.",©

t5_2qh1i,oddhair,1355190761,"It pales in comparison even to the few that are within sight of my lackluster scrolling, but here goes (it's painful, but you're in a shitty thread to not be able to accept some description of pain)  I used to be into car audio, and I knew you didn't want holes in your box, so I had an amp screwed onto a box (this is like '95) with a single screw, typical car audio/box building screw, maybe 1.5"" long, and the screw is maybe halfway in. I'm barefoot, like a dumbass, and the amp slides up toward the head when the truck box is out of my trunk. I heard a 'tink' sound, and then the entire 8-9 Lb amp lands, on its corner (as best I can figure) in the middle of my big toe nail. I figure corner, to this day, because the amp hitting my foot didn't start the agony for a few seconds, but I heard no noise from it hitting the concrete behind my shitty Buick.  But wait, it gets better: I went to a urgent care clinic, like an ER, without all the pathos, and only for people who can pay at least half right now (don't judge, I needed medical care for something horribly painful at ~7:00 in the evening, but nothing life-threatening, hence urgent care. The ER would have cost at least $1000.) the doc was good, as they tend to be, at causing undue but not malicious pain at a whim. He injected the anesthetic into my toe, into the end, right where the nerve is (under the typical ingrown area, I guess?.) In this case, the pain was immediate, bright and crystalline. He then moved on to the other nerve in the big toe, in the corresponding spot on the other side of the toe. Wow, twice in &lt;40 seconds, crystalline pain. He even went back to deaden the first one again, and the mere tug of pressure as he stuck the needle in was enough to make me jerk and start, even though I didn't have any pain this time.  A few minutes later, he prodded around and decided it was deadened enough to cut off the piece of nail hanging from the quick. Mind you, I almost did this myself with my crappy pocketknife before leaving the house, but I'm a lightweight at causing myself pain.  So, after the prodding, and my declaration that it felt sufficiently dead down there, he used a scalpel to remove the bit of nail bed and nail hanging there. This was, conveniently, the only part of that toe that was in no way numb. It was, somehow, worse than both needle sticks combined, and I stopped breathing, almost melodramatically. The couple of occasions I later ran my toe up under some construction supplies, in my Birkenstocks, were mere stubbings compared to The Event™.",™

t5_2qm4e,Criticalist,1355205104,"A number of thoughts come to mind about your assertion. I think you can claim a superficial level of plausibility, in as much that, nothing you say is actually wrong. However, I think the difficulty lies in the fact the system is so complex, that it is possible to find supporting observations for almost any hypothesis.    It’s probably useful to break down what you are suggesting into more manageable bits and look at whether there is supporting evidence.   1. We make too much cortisol when we are older.  Its certainly seems that we make more cortisol as we age, (although saying its “too much” is perhaps a bit loaded) and several studies have shown this (Purnell et al, JCEM 2004 for example).  2. These higher levels of cortisol contribute to mortality. Harder to say. There is a recognised association between higher cortisol levels and cardiovascular mortality, but that doesn’t mean that it is causative – it might be that sicker people have higher cortisol levels because they are sick, not the other way around. There are some plausible mechanisms by which cortisol might lead to heart disease and stroke though, probably related to fat deposition and metabolic syndrome.   3. Removing an adrenal gland will reduce the cortisol levels and thus improve lifespan.  I think this is where you are making the big leap. First, what effect does removing an adrenal gland have on plasma cortisol concentrations? I don’t know of any literature on this, but I don’t believe having only one adrenal has any clinical significance, or any effect on adrenal testing for example. I would strongly suspect that if you removed one gland the other would compensate and bring your cortisol levels up to what they were before, thus making your intervention worthless. However, if it does have an effect, how would you predict it? – what cortisol level would you be aiming for and how would you know if adrenalectomy would achieve it?  Its worth looking at outcomes for people with glucocorticoid deficiency, as by your hypothesis, people with these deficiencies should perhaps live longer. Secondary adrenal insufficiency does not include mineralocorticoid insufficiency, but the data suggests theses people have a higher mortality rate (Tomlinson et al, Lancet 2001). Health related quality of life is also impaired in these people and many of them are on disability pensions. Adjusting the dose does not seem to make much difference (Riedel et al ,Exp Clin Endo 1993) which suggests things are probably a lot more complex than we realise.  I would suspect that one area of complexity would be differential tissue cortisol acitivity. You touched on BHSD activity in your post, and certainly differential regulation of this enzyme system will have profound effects on glucocorticoid activity in different tissues that wont be reflected by plasma levels.   I think overall, one thing we have learned in medicine is that what seem to be simple interventions can have unforeseen outcomes. Cutting out an entire gland is perhaps a bit of big step to take based on speculation, even if it is informed ☺  ",☺

t5_2qh13,LurkWondertroll,1355207575,"It's like a beautiful microcosm of the human disaster right now: highly scarce, not easily renewable or replaceable resource running dangerously low, due to... helium party balloons.  If you read that in a novel not written by Douglas Adams, you would be disappointed, and chide the author for being too ridiculous.  But there we have it - we will not give up our helium party balloons. They represent Freedom™! And we'd rather be Free* than alive. It's not like the world becomes dramatically poorer if we stop filling useless objects with precious resources. But we pretend we would be unable to survive without our extravagences, and that's what burns the entire world to the ground.  How many people could the world support sustainably, over thousands of years, if everyone lived like an Afghan village, or an Indian village, or a Chinese village, doing subsistance farming? 10 billion, perhaps. And not pleasantly by anyone's metric. But they would not tax or destroy irreplaceable parts of the natural world nearly the same way we are currently.  Look at the first world. Look especially at the United States of America, but at Western, Northern, and somewhat Central Europe; at Australia, at the Chinese, Indian, Brazilian elites; at Russian leadership; look at how these parts of the world live, look at the resources they consume on a daily basis. The impact of one rich family is ENORMOUS - living half their lives on one side of the Atlantic, half on the other, homes in London, New York, air travel, huge expenditures of money on pets, children, holidays...   How many villages of people will live their lives entirely without approaching the same lifetime resources as one 4 or 5 person family?  The difference is 10 billion against 500,000, perhaps less, but I doubt the ratio is any more favorable than that.   Look at the world guys and gals, think about what is going on globally.   What group of very wealthy, connected, and powerful elites are slowly perching themselves atop the rest of us, ready to use the drowning force of our mass death in order to best assure their future survival? There is absolutely no movement on protecting the Earth, now obviously, nakedly, and painfully overtaxed by HUMAN life. No movement. No groups are doing nearly enough to protect anything, and no one really gives a fuck about that.  I mean, I do. A couple people I know. A loosely-knit confederation of fools, thinking day in and day out about how this species is about to construct a nightmare machine out of our once-nurturing mother Earth. We're feeding it. We're building the planet that will smash our race into bits, set life back hundreds if not thousands if not many many many more years.   Read anything you can find about the natural processes of global circulation - air, water, soil, fertilizers, mushroom spores, pollinators - all the incredibly complex natural functions of atmosphere and water, cross-species aid and global circulation. All of these processes, and many more besides, are breaking down. Bit, by bit, by bit.  Photosynthetic plankton is down 1% yearly since sometime in the 1960s. Photosynthetic plankton feeds the whole planet. Bees and pollinators are being utterly ruined by commercial farming and pesticides. Most of the fish stocks on the planet are ruined. Whales are pretty fucked. Coral is absolutely doomed to extinction, along with hosts of water-dwelling shelled organism  In a general sense, the world has run out of capacity to absorb the effluence of humanity, and now everything is dying. And helium balloons is the perfect defining symbol of it, I wager.  Thanks for reading.",™

t5_2r54y,aim2free,1355221296,"Think about it!  &gt; Is it mandatory for people to be a part of your system where everyone helps each other out?  Today it is mandatory to be part of a system, controlled by others, without ability to help each other out. Take such weird examples as:  1. if you happen to run som kind of weird proprietary licenced software or similar, you neighbor is in need, but you are due to some weird reasons, not formally legal, due to decisions by others, not allowed to help your neighbor.     2. you have a book, movie, drawing, which is out of print, which could help your neighbor, but you are, due to decisions by others, not formally allowed to copy your stuff, which could help your neighbor.     3. You find that you could help your neighbor by combining two different ideas and build a simple device that could help your neigbor, but, due to some nasty patent system, someone may have a patent on both of the smaller ideas you are combining, thus you are not, due to decisions by others, not formally allowed to build such a thing, helping your neighbor.     4. You find some problems with a device you have purchased, implying that it doesn't work as it was expected to do, but, nowadays this important information about the device as drawings, APIs, protocols, etc may be secret, not documented, and it may in some countries, due to an insanely evil invention 1998, DMCA, not even be formally allowed to reverse engineer it, to make it work.     5. You pay tax, don't you? but how your tax is used, is not controlled by you, in formal theory it should, but it doesn't. Like here in Sweden there are 7 billion SEK per year, that are withdrawn from forcibly withdrawn tax, to pay for unnecessary software licences, the only way you can avoid this robbery is to not pay tax.     6. You want to buy a new machine, but as you don't trust evil closed software, you do not want to buy a machine with evil closed proprietary software, as you can never know that the software does what it claims to do. Despite this it is in many countries a forced tax, a social allowance, that forces you to pay a tax to e.g. Microsoft, which in reality is a forced social allowance fee, to enable them to continue exist, to become even stronger in enforcing their taxes.     7. You may grow your own food, but your seed may have been contaminated by some evil entity's seed, which is patented, thus makes you a target, for trials, which may ruin you, and enforce you to sell your farm, due to the legal costs. Monsanto is such an evil entity that tries to control your food, to make you dependent upon them, in a similar way as Microsoft is trying with their infertile software. You are trapped.  &gt; Can he still have his own property, trade freely and not have to pay any taxes?  Remember how it worked once, like for the native Americans. Land-property could not be owned, you could put your living area wherever you wanted. In a similar way it worked for the Europeans that invaded the country, they settled somewhere, and they were free, to trade whatever they wanted, to pay whatever taxes they wanted, to share whatever they wanted. But not for long, then came the land-property owners and destroyed the system, in a similar way as some claim that ideas and creations can be ""owned"" today, thus destroying the system.  When you are free, you can pay whatever taxes you want. If you are smart you realize that if you dont give your other what they need, then others may not give what you need when you need it. This is the simple case for common infrastructure. Everyone that needs it, pay in some sense. The only problem is when someone is allowed to own, this common infra structure, then can steal from you ad infinitum.  &gt; Is human separation a human right and is it a part of liberty?  from my own I consider the separation of human from nature, separation of humans from the possibility to help others, separation of humans by destroying their possibilities to interact in a sane way, robbery of humans upon their huymanity.  The only true right is liberty of your mind, to make up your own mind. To think on your own, take your own decisions, and do not allow other people to control your mind, and, to take the logical consequences of your decisions.  Therefore, do not believe me, if what I'm saying doesn't make logical sense❣  However, as it is hard for everyone to take their own decisions in a complicated world, certain types of infra structure needs to be free, to not impose restrictions upon what you can decide upon in foolishness way  at one time, but which will make you a victim of your own stupidity later.  To that type of infra structure I would denote:  1. freedom of communication and transport.     2. freedom of health care.     3. freedom of education.       Regarding 1, that is fixable with technology, I'm working on.     Regarding 2, that is fixable with technology, others are working on.     Regarding 3, that is already free, apart from in some countries, but the freedom is not as good as it should be.  Check my draft proposal for education [article 26](http://wish-it.se/up/#a26).  ",❣

Lots of tones, looks great, good contruction, electronics were good.   I think it's great and out of so many I tried (even up in the 1000$ price range) this one just felt the best to me. Well worth a try out and for the price you can't go wrong.  I'll post the text from my NGD since the link didn't seem to work for you:  ----------------------------------------------  **2012 Epiphone Nighthawk Custom Reissue - Trans Black**  http://imgur.com/a/T4XGT  - Purchased at: Long &amp; McQuade in Canada  - Price: 410$ for just the guitar (Case, upgrade locking tuners, strap and strap-locks were extra)  **Features**   - Body: Solid mahogany with a figured Grade-AAA flamed maple top.    - Color:  Trans black. Wood grain is visible on back, top, and neck.    - Fretboard: Rosewood fingerboard with mother-of-pearl ""Crown"" inlays   - Neck: D-shaped SlimTaper profile   - Pickups: Slant NHT™ Humbucker; 4-wire, one NSX Single-Coil, NHR Mini-Humbucker 4wire Alnico II   - Electronics: Volume, Push/pull tapping on master tone control and five-way slider for a total of 9 different tone combinations     **General:** I really love it. It took me a while to find one I like. Fender scale length with Gibson everything else? How could I resist? I love the angled humbucker it's much like the one on my strat but way beefier and more full when you go single coil it sounds a lot like the strat. The neck humbucker really has those nice warm clean tones coming from it, it's strong and smooth - single coil it's a little more quiet and slightly more noisy much like a strat pickup. The middle pickup is a standard single coil but it pairs up with the others to give a really wide variety of tones. Pretty spiffy.  You'll also note that it doesn't have a trem since I don't really like them - they're a pain in the ass to get the intonation just right and I don't really use them so I figured I wouldn't bother with this one. This is a through body with a strat/trem style bridge. The thing just resonates in your hand. I love that.  I put on Schaller Strap locks and Grover 18:1 locking rotomatics as soon as I got it in my hands.   I have not, at this time, recorded any sounds from it. I've only just gotten it. But when I do I'll edit and post them here. It's been on back order for about 4 months and right now I'm just glad to be able to play it. ",™

If its just pure acne, like the others below suggested a ""anti inflammatory and allergen free"" type diet can help. Basically eat clean.   You may want to begin by cutting out processed &amp; fast foods. Sugar, low value carbs, gluten can be system agitators too.  I know sounds restrictive but today there are many organic, gluten free and no processed food options out there that taste good. Your face and body will love you for adopting a clean eating healthy diet.  For your face: Follow a good skin regime. Don't pick! Don't over dry and scrub with acne products as if you do it creates a vicious cycle of your skin sensing its dry and thereby producing more pore blocking and breakouts.    Over the counter: Many have actually had great results with pro-active  acne skin system.   From your doctor,  Epiduo gel. This gel Epiduo contains a combination of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide. Adapalene is a medication similar to vitamin A, but developed for sensitive skin. It helps treat acne and stimulates skin renewal.  Benzoyl peroxide has an antibacterial effect. It also has a mild drying effect, which allows excess oils and dirt to be easily washed away from the skin. This action can help to prevent and or minimize scaring due to encouraging skin surface turnover.  Aczone™.  This topical prescription contains 5% Dapsone in a gel base.  This is a treatment that treats both whiteheads and blackheads with low reported irritation to the skin.  Good luck and hopefully you will take the time to visit your doctor for a evaluation to know for sure what is driving your breakouts ie hormones, diet, allergies etc. From there you can make educated decisions in treating your skin.

It is not limited to scientists or state sponsorship, although licensed hunters must adhere to very strict terms and regulations.  [National Park Service, Everglades, Pythons in the Glades page:](http://www.nps.gov/ever/naturescience/burmesepythonsintro.htm) &gt; In recent years, snakes from around the world have been turning up in and around Everglades National Park. Burmese pythons, one of the largest snake species on earth, are now known to be breeding in the park and spreading throughout south Florida. Over 1,800 pythons have been removed from the park and surrounding areas since 2002-likely representing only a fraction of the total population.  [National Parks Traveler quotes the park superintendant:](http://www.nationalparkstraveler.com/2012/12/south-florida-snake-hunt-aims-dent-population-pythons-slithering-about-everglades20354)  &gt;Will the upcoming hunt blunt the python population of south Florida? Not with population estimates of Burmese pythons in the general Everglades area in the **""tens of thousands,""** said Everglades Superintendent Dan Kimball.  &gt;""I have been at the park, it will be nine years, and we’ve been wrestling with this for a long time,"" the superintendent said Saturday during a phone call. ""What I’ve learned through this whole thing is that there are no silver bullets when you’re dealing with an exotic species like this. What we’re trying to do is chip away at the problem.""  Burmese Pythons are a *much* bigger problem than you think.  I believe your information is seriously out-of-date.  [Based on official National Weather Service data for the last 60 years:](http://www.wunderground.com/history/airport/KMIA/1952/1/1/CustomHistory.html?dayend=1&amp;monthend=1&amp;yearend=2012&amp;req_city=NA&amp;req_state=NA&amp;req_statename=NA) &gt;                           Max           Avg           Min &gt;     Max Temperature       95 °F         83 °F         59 °F &gt;     Mean Temperature      86 °F         76 °F         52 °F &gt;     Min Temperature       82 °F         68 °F         42 °F  On average, the daytime high temperature for the area is 83 °F; hardly cold by any stretch of the imagination.  [The prizes for capturing Burmese Pythons](http://www.pythonchallenge.org/prizes.aspx) are geared towards finding and humanely dispatching the largest and greatest numbers of pythons possible, not enriching anyone.  All participants are required to be present at the award ceremony to collect prizes, making them easy to identify and disqualify if they broke the rules.  The cash prizes totaling only about $5,000 are not significant; people won't be doing this strictly for the money.  I'd bet the winners will actually have a net loss - the prize probably won't even cover their basic expenses.  [Official Rules for the Python Challenge](http://www.pythonchallenge.org/media/3378/python-challenge-official-rules.pdf)  &gt;You will be disqualified from the competition if you harvest and turn in: 1) a snake not from one of these WMA locations; 2) a native Florida snake; 3) one originally possessed as a pet; or 4) one originally possessed for research or commercial use. Any participant or person who violates any rules of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) or state statutes shall be subject to disqualification from the 2013 Python Challenge™ as well as charged accordingly for said violation.  &gt;You will be disqualified for posting inhumane photos or videos or for posting photos or videos of illegal activities (e.g. shooting from levees) on social media. Any participant or person who violates any rules of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) or state statutes shall be subject to disqualification from the 2013 Python Challenge™ as well as charged accordingly for said violation.  I believe these rules will discourage indiscriminate killings of native or other snakes.  Florida Fish and Wildlife aggressively pursues prosecution of unlicensed hunters and poachers, as well as those who violate the terms of the hunter's licenses.

t5_2qh2p,Dudesan,1355245060,"I've heard many christians claim that there's a distinction between ""moral, civil, and ceremonial laws"", but not one has ever been able to give me a straight answer about how they tell the difference between the three. It's clearly about what they find personally distasteful or silly, but admitting that that was the case would rather undermine their positions, so don't expect them to admit it. Apart from a few commands which were explicitly intended for a specific people at a specific time, there is absolutely nothing to indicate that most of these laws weren't supposed to be binding for everyone for all time. Indeed, in many places (See Leviticus 23:21, for example), it's explicitly stated that they *are*.  Remember, many Christians find it more comfortable to believe in a god who doesn't condone, command or commit murder, slavery, rape, child abuse, animal abuse, arson, torture, ritual mutilation, fratricide, patricide, matricide, infanticide, genocide, and so on than to believe in one who does.   Unfortunately, since the Bible (Old Testamant and New) is pretty clear about Yahweh's position on these things, holding a belief in Loving Hippie Jesus™ requires ignoring huge portions of it. Or just never reading it in the first place, which seems to be the most popular option.  Well, let's see what Jesus has to say about that:  &gt;“Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished.  (Matthew 5:17-18, NIV)  Some Christians claim that his death and resurrection ""fulfill"" this. That is bullshit for one simple reason: last time I checked, Heaven and Earth haven't passed away.  Jesus also made his views on people ""picking and choosing"" quite clear:  &gt;[Jesus] answered them, “And why do you break God’s commandment because of your tradition? For God said:    *Honor your father and your mother;* and, *The one who speaks evil of father or mother must be put to death.*  &gt; But you say, ‘Whoever tells his father or mother, “Whatever benefit you might have received from me is a gift committed to the temple”—  he does not have to honor his father.’ In this way, you have revoked God’s word because of your tradition. Hypocrites! Isaiah prophesied correctly about you when he said:    &gt;These people honor Me with their lips, but their heart is far from Me.  They worship Me in vain, teaching as doctrines the commands of men.”  (Matthew 15:3-9, NIV)   Looks like Jesus has quite a bit to say about people who ignore commandments, in fact. But maybe it's just Matthew?  &gt;It is easier for heaven and earth to disappear than for the least stroke of a pen to drop out of the Law.  (Luke 16:17, NIV)  Okay, so Jesus is a bust. Let's see what the Epistles have to say about the Mosaic Code:  &gt; If you really keep the royal law found in Scripture, “Love your neighbor as yourself,” you are doing right.  But if you show favoritism, you sin and are convicted by the law as lawbreakers. For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it.   (James 2:8-10, NIV)  &gt;All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness,  (2 Timothy 3:16)  &gt;Do we, then, nullify the law by this faith? Not at all! Rather, we uphold the law.  (Romans 3:31)  &gt;Know this first of all, that *there is no prophecy of scripture that is a matter of personal interpretation*, for no prophecy ever came through human will; but rather human beings moved by the holy Spirit spoke under the influence of God.""  (2 Peter 1:20-21 NAB)  ----  Well, shit.   This problem disappears quite quickly if you assert that most of the Bible is hogwash, and you only care about the good parts. If you prefer to cling to it as an inspired document, vague mutterings about ""context"" or about Jesus abolishing the old Law won't get you anywhere. ",™

t5_2sfmf,hankmurphy,1355274507,"&gt; Already answered.  Saying that doesn't actually put answers in the comment. You have not told me why marijuana is dangerous.  You want citations? Well, my citations aren't as reputable as Cracked™, but here they are anyway:  [Alcohol kills 2.5 million people per year.](http://www.who.int/research/en/)  [14,800 prescription medication deaths in 2008](http://www.cdc.gov/homeandrecreationalsafety/rxbrief/)  [Marijuana kills 0 people per year in the US](http://www.drugwarfacts.org/cms/Causes_of_Death)  Could you show me your proof again about how dangerous marijuana is?  &gt; Well a similar metric to how you can lose licensees.  So you think that people should be issued a ""drinking license"" that allows them to consume alcohol, and if they abuse that privilege then they lose their card and any subsequent alcohol use will be illegal? That's a really well thought-out solution. Would there be a test to get your drinking license, or would everyone get one when they reach a certain age? I have so many more questions. This is just such an incredibly smart and logical plan, I don't know why it wasn't implemented years ago.  &gt; Already answered.  The words ""Already answered"" do not actually answer my question. If I was asking whether or not you had already answered my question, that might have been an appropriate response. As it stands now you haven't actually answered my question, which was about why alcohol should be legal while marijuana is illegal. Please provide the answer below.  &gt; People use marijuana for the purpose of getting high. People can consume, eat, and cook alcohol but for other reasons besides to get drunk.  People use cannabis plants for many reasons, but you were too ignorant to check for yourself. The fibers make excellent rope or paper, the seeds are an excellent source of omega-3 acids, and THC has many medical properties which are only recently being discovered due to relaxed regulations.  Also, if you think alcohol's main purpose is for cooking then you're a moron of the highest degree. You're obviously not much of a thinker, but I'm pretty sure even a five year old knows that alcohol is for drinking.  &gt; My support of prescription medication is because to help heal people, not for people to get high.  Opiates have absolutely zero healing properties. Do you really think painkillers have healing properties? They don't.

Read the cracked article as to why that is bad argument.  &gt; People use cannabis plants for many reasons, but you were too ignorant to check for yourself. The fibers make excellent rope or paper, the seeds are an excellent source of omega-3 acids, and THC has many medical properties which are only recently being discovered due to relaxed regulations.  Since you didnt read the article  &gt; I hear both arguments from friends constantly, and not a goddamn fucking one of them has cancer. None of them has ever had a need for, nor owned a rope. And before they started reading ""facts"" off of a pro-weed website, not one of them thought twice about the paper industry. It's a bullshit, back-door argument. And, again, it makes everything they say seem invalid -- the same as when states that do legalize for medicinal use immediately see half of the patients use it, not for cancer, but mysterious ""chronic pain"" or ""stress relief."" In other words, they lie so they can get medicinal weed, not caring that it makes the entire campaign seem like a lie.  Break  &gt; Also, if you think alcohol's main purpose is for cooking then you're a moron of the highest degree. You're obviously not much of a thinker, but I'm pretty sure even a five year old knows that alcohol is for drinking.  Ad Hominem  &gt; Opiates have absolutely zero healing properties.

t5_2qh2p,Adamapplejacks,1355322172,"The author of the citation you provided for the Atheist, Gnostic, Theist, Agnostic opinion post is a 24 year old (21 at the time the piece was written) writer for Freethinker Magazine. How does his opinion hold more weight than official definitions?  Here's a nice passage that sums up how I feel about his article written by somebody on the comments below the actual opinion piece. I stress the word *opinion* by the way.  Theist, Atheist, Gnostic, Agnostic.  Peter Brietbart's bold and entertaining …attempt to clarify and classify these words, so that their rogue meanings no longer confuse and muddle religious debate is, sadly, deeply flawed and does exactly the opposite (as reflected in many of the responses).  Peter's opening paragraphs revealed his own muddled thinking. No wonder he has many headaches! Apparently, his informing of someone that he is an atheist generates (too many times) the response, ""Oh, but how could you know that God doesn't exist? You're taking a faith position!"" Instead of allowing himself to be embroiled in irrelevant controversy, his simple answer, as I am sure he realises, should have been, ""Atheist simply means I disbelieve in the existence of God, it does not mean I claim that god does not exist."" Even though Peter might believe that God does not exist, by merely informing someone that he is an Atheist he is not claiming that fact. Simple; end of story, no headaches. (In fact, of course, none of Peter's four terms makes the claim of God's non-existence.)  Moving on to the rest of Peter's presentation, there are a number of issues which do not fare well under scrutiny.  1. The prefix â€˜aâ€™ is from the Greek, meaning â€˜notâ€™. Thus a word can automatically generate its own converse which together form a closed pair. In trying to mix two closed pairs, which are inevitably mutually exclusive, Peter is attempting the impossible. Think of it this way; take a list of any such pairs, for example, theist/atheist, typical/atypical, on/off, gnostic/ agnostic, symmetrical/asymmetrical, dead/alive and try to mix any one with another. It is immediately obvious that closed pairs, by definition, in any combination, cannot be combined and are meaningless.  2. Peter's graphs and text show and claim degrees of certainty; but that is impossible. Certainty is absolute, either you're pregnant or you ain't, babe! And the same principle applies to theist and gnostic. This leads me to mention that any suggestion of using probability in place of certainty is also doomed. For anyone to claim to have a 29% probability of believing in god (leaving a 71% probability of not believing in god) is clearly absurd! (NB A probability of 100% means certainly and a probability of 0% means certainly not.)  3. Presuming cognisance of the concept of god as a supernatural object, it follows that, regardless of their belief or otherwise in the existence of god, anyone may be an agnostic. By definition it does not conflict with that of theism or that of atheism and can therefore coexist, separately, with either. It is irrelevant and meaningless, for example, to insert oneself as an 'I-don't-know-whether-I-believe-in-god-or-not' ditherer, between theist and atheist. (By default the don't-know is not a theist and must be an atheist.)  4. Bearing in mind the declared intention of Peter's article, his introduction of the combined labels, atheist agnostic, theist gnostic, atheist gnostic and theist agnostic only compounds the difficulties encountered by some folk. For those (and for the rest of us!) I suggest you abandon Peter's added complexities and simply learn the definitions of the four words under discussion and treat them as two separate closed pairs. You will see the light, halleluiah!  theist: one who believes in the existence of God; atheist: one who disbelieves in the existence of God; gnostic: one who claims having knowledge, especially spiritual; agnostic: one who believes that we know nothing of things beyond material phenomena, that a creator, creative cause and an unseen world are things unknown or unknowable.  Capitalization errors/Unusual html format/punctuation errors aside, the man essentially makes my point.  In addition, another woman points out the dilemma regarding deists.  ""I’m not sure I understand where a deist would fall on this list…and what about panendeists? or panthiests? I get the last two confused. I ask because while I identify as agnostic or deist, I really believe that what some people consider “God” is actually just the universe, nature, the essence of life.""  So why, exactly is the original definition so frustrating again? Really, you should probably be more upset with Atheists that misclassified themselves in the first place (if what you say is true that most don't disbelieve in the existence of a higher power).",™

t5_2qi58,devineman,1355330557,"Manchester.   United and City started for very, very different reasons.  United were started for a bunch of railway workers, many of which were immigrants and of Irish descent which one of the reasons why they've traditionally been seen as out of towners.  City was started by the Connell family, a Priest and his daughter (I think we're the only league Club to have a woman founder IIRC), as a way to find something else for the local boys to do as they were creating street gangs and thieving in a very tough time to live.  They kind of grew out of this respective heritage though the years.  City still to this very day believe themselves to be intrinsically linked to their community as a way of helping the working classes.  United still to this very day see themselves as the Club built for everybody, completely inclusionary of all people from all races and all corners of the world.    Immediately you see the different mindsets and ethos of the respective Clubs.  United were the communistic ideal of equality, City were the socialistic idea of community service.    In the early days, both Clubs moved around the city, not really finding their natural home due to a lack of funds and a lack of facilities.  United bounced from Newton Heath to Clayton then eventually to Old Trafford.  If you think of it like a clock, United went from 1 o'clock in the city, to about 6 o'clock.  All of their sites retained a closeness to major railway sites, including Old Trafford which is a stones throw from the Trafford Park sail line.  Much of Manchester's history is built on our utilisation of rail to trade.    Just a quick aside here.  Liverpool were actually the port where all trade used to come into and it made the area pretty affluent.  Manchester, which is a little more inland and was the production centre, then built a Ship Canal from the coast directly into the city and built a railway (the first ever and which an old relative of devineman was one of the drivers) which basically bypassed their city entirely.  This is the modern beginnings of the Manchester-Liverpool rivalry as Liverpool accused Manchester of ""tukin der jerbs"", and United being a railway workers club, well, you can see how it gets going.  Old Trafford is next to the docks of the Ship Canal which became an important port too.  Whilst United were trying to find their home around the rails, City was moving too.  They started off on the playing fields of Gorton but their first real ground was just in Ardwick then again moved to Maine Road.  United were moving around the edges and City who started at about four o'clock on the clock geogrphy of Manchester, were moving inwards towards the centre of the city.  For what it's worth, City were the more affluent of the neighbours at this time for a few reasons.  Mainly it's because we moved towards population centres whilst United kept in the industrial centres (again, remembering the ethos upon which both clubs were founded and United's rail ties).  This is good to remember because changes in the UK actually made the population centres of this time into working class areas and the old industrial parts of the city into the suburbs where wealthier people lived about 70 years later. City had lots of money and bought their ground off of the old owners, a brewery and with their new riches built the Wembley of the North, Maine Road.  Funnily, they were building Wembley at the time and the people who built Maine Road was the Northern division of the company that built Wembley so there was a bit of a competition internally to who could get it finished and in a better quality.  Maine Road gave City a new burst of wealth and it still hold the records for any attendance in England outside of Wembley both in a league game (United/Arsenal) and  any game (City/Stoke).    Whilst things were going well for the affluent City, United fell into major financial problems.  One of the problems with having lots of fans who are railway workers, is that some of them will eventually get back on their train and go home.  Around the time that City were hosting England internationals at their (Ardwick) stadium, United were declaring bankruptcy.  They were saved because a guy called John Henry Davis bought them up and was determined to make them into a big Club.  You have to remember that there weren't just United and City around at this time, there were a good ten or twenty teams around Manchester, with City being the major Club and the others all having decent sized crowds but struggling once City started hosting glamour matches and transportation links in the city became better then started winning trophies.  John Henry Davis was a wealthy guy, owning a big alcohol based business and marrying into the Tate family fortune (Tate as in Tate &amp; Lyle the sugar merchants and the Tate Modern art gallery).  Together with a group of businessmen, he took over the ailing United and started to rebuild their ground and invest money in the Club.  Actually he didn't really, the class fairy came down and waved her magic wand and Manchester United were now formed and were the biggest Club ever.  Ahem.    Just as another aside, there seems to be plans on the table at this point for United to move into the centre of Manchester to try and get bigger attendences but this never got off the ground.  The ""Manchester Central"" name that people think was considered is actually a myth as far as anyone can tell but as another marker of their Irish heritage, they did briefly consider Manchester Celtic.  I've always consider Manchester United to be the perfect name for them.  Many of the Clubs in Manchester around this time were going out of business due to City and calling the team Manchester: United gave them a sense that it had been absorbed into United.  Again, United being the inclusive Club, welcoming all comers to share their experience.  At this point in history, City were the dominant Club in the region and due to this were putting everybody else out of business, who couldn't compete with their huge revenues or drawing power.  United were languishing in obscurity somewhat and were funded by a rich investor who did up their stadium, bought them lots of players and made them a real threat to the dominance of City.  History isn't without a sense of irony it seems.  There was a wage cap around this time.  Footballers were not yet millionaire superstars and often had a couple of jobs on the side.  Manchester was still heavily working class area and a production central rather than the cosmopolitan place that London was.  One of the things that City did at the time, was break FA rules by paying their players the wage cap but then also giving them bonuses for performance.  They were caught and spanked by the FA whilst a bunch of their players were banned from playing.  Of course, these players had to be auctioned off and who was the one guy sat in the auction room buying player after player?  Ernest Magnall, manager of Manchester United and backed by Henry Davis.  They bought them all and won their first major trophies.  The first Welsh Wizard that went from City to United and became a legend was Billy Meredith, a supreme player for his time and is probably still adjudged by historians as one of United's best ever players.  He was also the guy who whilst playing for City buggered us up with the FA.  He was caught trying to bribe a Villa player to throw a game, asked City to cover it up which we didn't so he ble the whistle on the bonus payments.  He's still seen as a legend at City too and actually coached both teams in his later years.  The Bryan Kidd of his day, but with more talent (sorry Kiddo).  He even went on later to setup the PFA.  Of course, City being the dominant animals at the time still planning their super stadium, weren't going to allow the fact that we were banned for financial doping and docked points stop them, so they nicked United's manager and a couple of players back including Meredith.  Magnall's last game in charge of United when he'd already agreed to join City?  The Manchester Derby.  At Old Trafford.  Which City won 1-0.  And he celebrated as they scored.  Magnall actually was a major force behind both City's move to Maine Road and United's move to Old Trafford, and he won trophies for both Clubs so he's a legend anyway.  The First World War broke out and the tensions between the Clubs cooled a bit as the British Spirit™ kicked in and it was us taking on those dastardly Krauts.  Even post war when City were building their Wembley of the North, they considered a ground share with United (who by this time had Davies investment in their ground, the above story is supposed to be concurrent), a new spirit of handshakes all around prevailed.  The inter-war years pretty much went how they pre-war years went.  City continued to do well and win trophies including the FA Cup and the league.  United not so much.  City got to the FA Cup final in 33 and won it in 34 whilst maintaining high league positions and winning the league in 37.  As a marker for things to come for City, they scored 100 goals in their title winning season of 37 then became the only reigning champions ever relegated in 38 despite scoring the most goals in the league (F: 80, A:77).  My Grandad points to this moment as the genesis of ""Typical City"" and says that we were actually a great team but were miles behind tactically but then, my Grandad says a lot.  He also says that Kinkladze was half the player of Peter Doherty so fuck him.  Speaking of elderly relatives, my highly religious and a bit nutty Nan (on the other side) tells me that there was a Catholic-Protestant split in the fanbases too, and I've been told this by quite a few people but never found anything to back it up.  This might explain why City and Rangers are close, or we could just both think United and Celtic are twats?",™

You backed him into a corner when he attempted to give you specifics to the best of his ability and you told him ""not good enough,"" and on top of that, you also misrepresented his argument. Just because he doesn't know how to articulate his thoughts on *why* he doesn't like this song as accurately as you are expecting him to doesn't invalidate his opinion. Music, perhaps more than *any* other form of entertainment, is ridiculously subjective, and as a musician you should know this. And if you are looking for a technical analysis of the song, then you are in the wrong place, and you are asking the wrong questions.  Look, we get it. You like the song. You're a musician so you can point to specifics as to *why* you like the song. We are *not* musicians. We *cannot* point to specifics as to why we don't like the song. That doesn't invalidate our opinion on the song, nor does it give you the right to laud your status as a musician over us and dictate to us why the song is somehow ""objectively"" good and we are just undereducated plebs who don't know what we're talking about.  We are not talking about science or math here. There is no ""right"" answer. We are talking about *music.* It is inherently subjective and emotional, and *most people* can't give you an abundance of specifics as to why they like or don't like a specific song.

I think it was most likely a prank the three kids pulled on everyone else and are now in it too deep to back out. It's also likely Kid B pulled a prank on Kid A and now can't back out, so is also making a pretense of freaking out.

Several creams are available with specific ingredients aimed to combat itch. These include Eurax cream®, E45 anti-itch cream®, Balneum Plus Cream®  and Xepin Cream®.  In addition, antihistamine tablets may be tried. Some antihistamines can cause drowsiness and one needs to avoid driving etc. after they have been taken. However, it tends to be the antihistamines that cause mild sedation such as Atarax® which are the best at helping with itching, especially at night. During the day, a non-sedating antihistamine such as Clarytin® could be tried. People often need to find which antihistamine suits them by trying several different ones. One further treatment which can be used is ultraviolet light therapy. This is only available in hospital dermatology units. Self-treatment with home ultraviolet lamps is not advisable as the overall dose would not be monitored and one could cause lasting damage to the skin. An eight-week course of therapy can sometimes help with itching, although benefits may only be temporary.""  Best wishes to your mom, hope she'll find some relief soon!",®

t5_2qh4j,JayKayAu,1355369329,"&gt; Nonsense. This money doesn't simply sit in a vault gathering dust. It's going toward lowering interest rates for business investors and into capital markets.  Ah! So you didn't read what I wrote.  Let me rephrase to help you understand my view:   Business investors and capital markets will invest money in a particular way, a *characteristic* way. They'll prefer some things over other things. The things they take into consideration will only be a *subset* of all meaningful considerations. For example, if there's a nice, juicy ROI on an petroleum project, do you really think they'll hold back because of the consequences of global warming?  They will have an investment *fingerprint*. They'll be leaking externalities all over the place, and the types of externalities are pretty well understood.  The same, of course, is true of government. Governments have a characteristic fingerprint too, although it is very different to that of business investors and capital markets.  &gt; Who decides what 'overall value maximization' is?   With all due respect, this is a question only an economist would ask.   If you ask a social scientist about the effects of income inequality...   If you ask an environmental scientist about pollution...   If you ask a doctor about health...   If you ask an urban designer about our built environment...  You'll get a wealth of objective, scientific information on how to maximise overall value. And how to do it *much* better than we are right now. There's an absolute treasure trove of knowledge out there that is well established, built on solid evidence, and would lead to a considerably better world than the one we live in.  (Of course, this is imperfect and evolving. But despite those imperfections, it's still a bit better than what we've currently got - just look at the number of scientists who are desperate for regulation to be altered.)  But at some point, we've decided that we'll ignore all of that knowledge and let the invisible hand do it for us.  To a person like me (a STEM major), it seems plainly obvious that the market is distortive relative to the above knowledge. And that the invisible hand simply cannot be relied upon as the **sole** source of our economic decision making. If we did, we'd end up with a In Soviet Russia™ level of distortion.  What should we be doing instead? Routing part of our GDP through a different mechanism. Like mixed economies do. A mechanism that makes different decisions, places different values on things, and compensates for distortions of the first.  The only smart thing to do, in my view, is to refrain from ideology and prejudice against government and taxation and find solutions that align best with what our best science tells us. If we can find a way that a market can do it, great! If a market is the wrong tool, then let it be done publicly.",™

But you're not answering any of the actual questions people have raised.  This is mostly because a) you're obviously biased and b) more importantly,  you're wrong about ™ law.  &gt; Essentially, we still retain some rights to the trademark on the name, since we achieved interstate commerce prior to the Chicago band filing for the trademark, and long before they actually received it.  You're using interstate commerce as if it's some achievement based on sales or notoriety and that said popularity has any legal significance. It doesn't. Interstate commerce is simply a jurisdictional hook necessary for the federal government to have a say.   As far as who had use first, that may be a relevant question to the status of the Chicago band's trademark, but that doesn't mean you ""retain"" rights automatically. You can rely on your unregistered common law trademark rights in an attempt to cancel the registration based on a prior use argument, argue for concurrent use or otherwise try to establish yourself as the senior user, but once again, this is something that **you'd** have a burden to prove...which is what people have inquired about but you've never actually done.   Instead of doing that, you've actively admitted that you were on notice that the Chicago band probably was formed and using the name before you. This is most likely an admission against your own interests and you'd do best to STFU. Beyond that, it's just spurious claims about industry norms, ""working it out"" and the other side being dicks.

LEGO® has had a long and exhaustive history of beating down anything that vaguely plagiarises or even hints at plagarising their product.  Months slid past while we were in legal uncertainty. One festival after another disappeared.    Finally, they broke the suspense by dropping a bomb on us: surrender all copies of the film and everything with it to us in seven days. Or else.   Fortunately, the old release I'd received from LEGO® Australia right at the very beginning saved me.

t5_2qqjc,EpicSkald,1355407241,"**Gylfaginning** or *Beer &amp; Foaling In Midgard*  Once upon a time in a galaxy far, far away, the Gods existed. They kind of rocked, as you'd expect from any pantheon whose gods had alternative names such as ""Lord of the Hanged"" or ""Gore Master."" They hung out in forests and on mountains, wailing out awesome guitar solos against backdrops of lightning and dragons and shit. But as awesome as they were, they needed somewhere to live, somewhere to let buddies stay when they stopped over, somewhere to store their Bon Jovi CDs.  Now the gods didn't have any money with which to buy homes, as the concept of money didn't exist yet, nor did homes, so they went to an  independent contractor who also happened to be a giant. Problem was, builders were complete cowboys back then, and giants were the worst. I mean, the gods generally hated giants, and Thor in particular went all HULK SMASH on sight, but he was off performing sweet drum solos on the skulls of his enemies with a hammer far away at the time, and nobody else seemed capable of noticing he was a giant, so the gods heard out this builder. His initial quote was as overblown as they are today, and to build the gods a mighty home with a vast wall around it, he asked for the Sun, the Moon, and the smoking hot badass goddess-of-love-and-death Freyja. Yeah, you thought you got overcharged having that boiler fitted.  The gods convene. They scrum down like they're about to make a football play, with Odin stating the obvious: ""Not happening."" Unfortunately, Loki was present, and Loki is An Asshole™. He has an idea. ""We let him do it on the proviso that he finishes it within three seasons and with the help of no man nor giant.""  Most builders can't even finish the guttering on my house in that time, let alone building the HOME OF THE GODS, so they figure why not? Convinced, they agree on terms &amp; conditions, give the builder a handshake, and he returns the next day to start work.  He returns with a horse.  Not just any horse, my friends. THE horse. Svadilfari, a horse the size of a juggernaut, a horse you DO NOT FUCK WITH.  The gods see this, and collectively realise they are screwed when it begins hauling truly massive boulders around for the builder, letting him get his Minecraft on at full tilt. A job that should have taken him a decade may, incredibly, get completed inside of nine months, provided no creepers attack. Panic ensues. The Sun, the Moon, and the smoking hot badass goddess-of-love-and-death Freyja are not really things they can do without. Three days before the deadline is about to be reached, it's clear the builder is going to finish in time.  A plan is hatched. It's a good plan, summed up best as ""blame Loki."" Satisfied that this is foolproof, the gods let Loki slink off. But wait! What's this? Another horse??!? Loki, you see, is a shapeshifter. Somehow motivated by the gods declaring they'll put Loki to a horrible, torturous death if the builder actually finishes on time, he finds the motivation to do something about it, running off to shift his form into that of a female horse. Not a pony. We do not need Loki MLP fanfic at this point. No, just no.  So Loki trots off to to where the builder is working, and waves his sweet mare tush at Svadilfari, who is as horny as an overworked stallion, due to being an overworked stallion. He gives chase as Loki runs off into the forest, some bow-chikka-wow-wow plays, and instead of getting rocks onto the build site, Svadilfari gets his rocks off inside Loki. The builder, without his horse, suddenly finds himself with no hope of completing the build on time. Loki, whose shapeshifting is apparently VERY anatomically correct, gets pregnant. Furries across the world rejoice as transgender mpreg bestiality is invented. The gods just rejoice that they have a bitchin' new home built for free.  It's about that time that Thor returned, and noticed the builder was asking for tree fiddy as recompense for his time. Thor instantly saw through this clever ploy and recognised him for a giant, grabbed his hammer, declared any contract null and void as it had been made not with a man but a giant, played out the better part of the sweet Rush tune YYZ on the giant's head and scrotum with Mjolnir, grabbed a beer and went to kick back in this asskicking new pad they dubbed Asgard.  Some time later, Loki finally spreads his legs and drops a lot of weight. Of course, when a horse the size of an elephant gets it on with a transformed god, the kid isn't going to be some weedy little foal with shaky legs that can barely stand up, hell no. The horse he gives birth to is SLEIPNIR, an equine asskicker with eight legs to enable TWICE the asskicking of your common or garden horse. It is declared the horse to end all horses, and Loki gives the ultrahorse to Odin to make up for being a supreme dickbiter over the whole building-of-Asgard episode. Odin mounts this monster truck of a horse, pops a wheelie, and makes some sweet jumps over the walls of Asgard, before sitting down for the evening to figure out how in the hel he's going to afford his new horseshoe budget.",™

Conversely, if not forgiveness but something else may be required to insure any possible benefit for which you may be eligible, I ask that this, whatever it may be, be granted or withheld, as the case may be, in such a manner as to insure your receiving said benefit. I ask this in my capacity as your requested intermediary between yourself and that which may not be yourself, but which may have an interest in the matter of your receiving as much as it is possible for you to receive of this thing, and which may in some way be influenced by this type and telepathically transmitted prayer.

t5_2qore,DLWormwood,1355416638,"&gt; Well according to the developers the game was NOT built around the AH. While they had an AH for their in house testing, they did not have millions of people to add to the market.  Hence why is said *appeared* and put the phrase in quotes. Despite their intent, the developers under-appreciated the ramifications that a low friction trade economy would have on the player base and how they perceived the metagame.  &gt; Inferno was branded as the impossible difficulty where you needed to farm each act until you could safely move on to the next act. I hate to compare it to an MMO, but you can think of it as a raid progression.  In that case, Blizzard just did the same thing they normally do in WoW. They release new content at a higher level of difficulty than necessary to figure out the pain points, then ramp the curve down over time to let more people experience the “content,” as well as smooth over the places where they genuinely didn’t expect the game to be so hard due to bugs and design oversights. Standard Blizzard Operating Procedure.™ (SBOP?)  I do agree with your appraisal about iLvls, though. An early impression Blizzard gave prior to Beta was that the entirety of Inferno was meant to be farm-viable, something they attempted to reinstate via Monster Power. (A kind of kludge, given that D2’s “/players x” was kind of a cheat code in the first place, only usable off the realms and in solo play.)",™

He held the gaze of Kaylee’s one remaining eye for a few seconds before slowly, ever so slowly, pushing the poker up towards her nipple. The horror and pain in her face was beautiful. He loved that she knew what was going to happen, and that all of her struggling against them was worthless. Kaylee’s nipple hissed as the hot poker pressed against it, but her broken-toothed scream drowned the noise.

t5_2tvrv,Zombie_Army,1355426100,"**Steam name**: ❄mellow❄  **Awesomenaut name**: Penny &amp; Robro  **Description**: Born on to the famous intergalactic explorers, James and Marsha Sunslayer (not to be confused with the Connecticut Sunslayers), Penny spent most of her life traveling the universe with her parents.  While a life of exploration is high in excitement and adventure, her childhood was mostly lonely.  What friends she did make on her travels, she would quickly abandon when her parents decided to move on to the next system.    Her parents realized the loneliness gripping their daughter (and the constant danger they put her in) and decided to do something about it.  Using materials they had collected from their travels, James built Robro, the perfect robot friend and protector.  Penny and Robro became fast friends.  Robro was always there for Penny to confide in and Penny was constantly tinkering with Robro, making him better and better.  Unfortunately though, while on one of their many adventures, Penny lost contact with her parents.  She tried to track them down, but to no avail.  Moneyless and stranded on an unfamiliar planet, Penny began entering Robro into the local ROBO-FIGHTS.  Thanks to Penny's modifications, Robro became the top robo-fighter on the planet.  The years passed and with no one left to challenge and still no news about her parent's status, Penny was contacted about a new opportunity.  One that could provide a true challenge for Robro and put her in contact with creatures from around the universe.  With the promise of a challenge for Robro and the possibility that one of these new aliens might have information about her missing parents , Penny and Robro left their planet and became the newest members of the Awesomenauts.      **Abilities**:  Bear Hug:  Thanks to the modifications Penny has made over the years, what began as the perfect hug has turned into something more.  Penny can command Robro to Bear Hug.  Robro then dashes forward to squeeze the life out of a target, snaring them in place and doing damage over time.  Hide and Seek:  Turning one of Penny's favorite childhood games into a weapon, Penny commands Robro to go hide, turning him invisible for the duration.  While Robro is invisible, Penny gains truesight (she can see invisible stuff) while Robro becomes temporarily invulnerable, but unable to attack.  At any point, Penny can command Robro to appear, temporarily stunning any enemies near him.  I imagine these characters to behave sort of like the Ice Climbers in SSB.  Unless given a direct command, Robro follows Penny and mirrors her actions. Sorry it's so long, I just got kind of carried away.",❄

PLANET EARTH – June 28, 2025 – In 2017, an epic battle took place between humans and dangerous insect alien invaders determined to destroy our way of life. Humanity persevered during the war and destroyed the alien Mothership, recovering most of the prosperity it once had. In preparation for another insect onslaught, the mighty Earth Defense Force (EDF) devoted years of research to combat this menace by upgrading their soldier classes, artillery capabilities, vehicles and much more. However, news poured in today, that what humanity feared the most became true. The giant creatures seen in Arizona seven years ago have returned.  The EDF is calling all the citizens of Earth to join together in the fight to battle against the massive upcoming attack in 2013 for the Xbox 360® video game and entertainment system from Microsoft and PlayStation®3 computer entertainment system. Ask yourself: are you ready to save Earth?!",®

I got occassional kernel panics on a Nexus S. It seems the Galaxy Nexus had very similar kernel panics. If you get a kernel panic, 99% that it comes from the proprietary graphics driver while doing some standard task like trying to display an image. With 4.2 it doesn't seem to happen anymore. Maybe they *finally* convinced samsung or whoever is responsible for the drivers to fix them.  Sometimes it just looses mobile connectivity alltogether and can't connect to the mobile network until I reboot it. So what's the other big proprietary component on android smartphones? You guessed correctly - the GSM stack.  I am 99% sure it would be much more stable if all the drivers were open source and integrated in the corresponding well maintained upstream projects.",™

Inception was another NolanCoaster™ which brought notable actors together to create a long, multi-rhythmic matryoshka doll of unnecessary sub layers, nestled deep within film homages and driven by a script that seemed to use these technical aspects of the universe to provide for the pulp of exposition.

t5_2tz1e,_Trilobite_,1355458167,"Yes. I was 6. Our family took a trip to San Francisco and on the way there we stopped in at some fancy hotel near the ocean cliffs. (This isn't going where you think it's going). There was this park behind the hotel that went all the way to edge of the cliffs. There was a swingset and my brother and I were swinging on it while our parents talked and took pictures of the ocean. I jumped off the swings, and as my brother was at the way back end of his swing I grabbed him and shoved him. He rocketed forward at twice the speed he was already going and flew off at the end. He was in the air for maybe 3 full seconds before landing on his back and getting the wind knocked out of him.   In the moment, I felt badly, but never realized that if he had landed differently he could have actually died.  In terms of *almost* getting killed, my retarded ass friend was playing around with my pellet gun in my garage one day and pointed it at my head. He pulled the trigger jokingly, thinking it wasn't loaded and was on safety. Let's just make this qiuck.  **Gun:**  ☑ Loaded  ☑ Off of safety  ☑ Pointed at my head  Luckily he missed. I almost died of absolute fucking terror.He was so terrified of what happened that he literally just put down the gun and started saying ""Holy fucking shit"" over and over. For maybe 20 seconds after it happened we were both just standing there completely in shock of what the hell (could've) just happened.",☑

When I use my fingers for application I almost always use my ring finger. Lighter touch since its not used as much as our pointer.   4) Don't blend too much. You'll know. It'll look like a muddy mess of your darkest colour.   5) if its issues with blending out with your outer 'v' use less dark colour. It's easier to manage.   I hope those few tips help!

And when I'm grieving or depressed, the last thing I want is to be imposed with the obligation to respond to an over cheerful twinkle unicorn in the name of trying to ""cheer me up"".  No.  How I cheer people up is quite boring actually. I'd slip into that person's life. You know, take things easy - stuff like, how're you holding up man? Nice weather out there. Wanna go for a bite? No? Oh and by the way, I'm heading down to the bar tonight. Wanna join? Okay, your loss. Hah! See ya tomorrow man. Take care bro.  Next day? Call in, same routine. Observe. Am I too imposing? Am I trying too hard? Yes? Cut back. Cool off. But never stop throwing signs that I'm there. When you're ready, I'm here. Hey, I might be stuck in my work or rushing a deadline. But I want you to know bro, you got something to spit, I'll have that beer ready to chill out with you.  Something like that. It's important to let a person know that there's somebody out there that cares for him/her, without making the impression that you're doing all that just because of whatever happened that dragged that person down in the first place.  So I guess yeah, that's how I do it all the time. It's not easy, requires a lot of patience, and it involves this rare thing called true friends who give a shit™.  Now that all my best buds are overseas, it's been a while since anybody did that for me. Sigh. But yeah, I guess that's my answer to your question. I'm heading out for a beer now.",™

t5_2r2jt,misskrisbliss,1355512846,"Adoption is truly a miracle, in my opinion. Despite the fact that it's basically a scientific anomaly, 3 out of my mom's 5 friends from college that she is still close with 20 years later ended up having infertility issues. One went the IVF route, but two chose adoption and it has been the most amazing blessing for both families. We don't know the background behind one of the girl's life before she became a part of my mom's friend's family, but the other family rescued their daughter from a woman who was a daily meth user and alcoholic. Hell, she even named the kid Alize (you know, after that cheap fruity stuff) because she thought it sounded dignified... Fortunately they changed her name to Allison so they can keep calling her ""Ally"" but the most important thing is that just as much as they rescued Ally, she rescued them. After years of sadness and stress from not being able to achieve their family goals, they were finally able to become parents as they always dreamed of and their home is filled with joy now, for everyone.   You can rest assured knowing that just as much as this was an important step toward your long term happiness, it was for his adoptive family as well. I commend and respect you so much for making such a hugely important decision at such a young age, and I hope that someday *when you're ready* (if you want to, of course!) that you will have your own shot at motherhood. Wishing you the best, my dear! ♥ ",♥

You might want to drink some broth, and add some mineral salt, to help with the fatigue and headaches (it's usually related to dehydration when starting keto).  I posted this in [another thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/142zze/centrum_specialist_energy_yay_trying_to_increase/c79kk68):  ---  [Centrum Specialist® Energy](http://www.centrum.com/centrum-specialist-energy) contains 40 mg magnesium (Magnesium Oxide) and 80 mg potassium (Potassium Chloride, same as mineral salts), the RDAs are way higher than that.  Mineral|Adequate Intake (mg) |:--|--: Sodium|1500 Potassium|4700 Magnesium|420 Calcium|1000  With keto you might not need the full 4700 mg of potassium, some recommendations are a bit lower at 2500 mg. You excrete more sodium the need for potassium is lower, with a high carb intake a high potassium intake is mostly to balance sodium levels (high insulin levels causes you to retain sodium).  &gt; The diuretic (dehydrating) nature of ketosis causes an excretion of three of the body’s primary electrolytes: sodium, potassium, and magnesium (31,40). These three minerals are involved in many processes in the body, one of which is the regulation of muscle contraction, including the heart.  Some studies show a net loss of calcium while others do not (31).  &gt; To counteract the excretion of minerals on a ketogenic diet, additional mineral intake is  required.  Although exact amounts most vary, suggested amounts for the three primary  electrolytes appear below (26,46):  &gt; Sodium: 3-5 grams in addition to the sodium which occurs in food   Potassium: 1 gram in addition to the 1-1.5 grams of potassium which occur in food   Magnesium: 300 mg    [""The Ketogenic Diet""](http://books.google.se/books?id=JtCZBe-2XVIC&amp;lpg=PA79&amp;ots=dNISh1zQJz&amp;hl=en&amp;pg=PA79#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false) by Lyle McDonald, page 79.  It's probably easier to get nutrients through food, or if you need potassium you can use a mineral salt. Using a mineral salt (like [Morton's Lite Salt](http://www.fatsecret.com/calories-nutrition/morton/lite-salt)) gives you 2500 mg potassium per 10 gram. A 100 grams of Spinach gives you [around 560 mg of potassium](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=spinach+100+gram), a 100 grams of Avocado gives you [about 450 mg of potassium](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=avocado+100+gram), a 100 grams of beef has [about 300 mg](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=beef%20100%20gram).  If you want to supplement potassium look for ""Potassium Citrate"" as that has good absorption rate, [and it's used in some studies as a way to prevent kidney stones](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19911683). In the US the regular potassium supplements are usually limited to ~100 mg, so most of them are practically useless.  Almonds has [289 mg of magnesium per 100 grams](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=almonds 100 grams), Spinach has 79 mg magnesium per 100 grams.  Examine.com has a list of some magnesium sources:  &gt; A few dietary supplements, usually those that are herbs or food products, may also contain Magnesium. These include:  &gt; * Basella Alba (Indian Spinach) at 114+/-1mg/100g * King Oyster (Mushroom) at 740+/-230mcg/g * Seeds of Mucuna Pruriens * Seeds of Irvingia Gabonensis (African Mango) at 429+/-0.3ppm dry weight * Royal Jelly at 217.493mg/kg  *Examine.com*, [""Magnesium, Sources""](http://examine.com/supplements/Magnesium/#summary1-0).

t5_2qh33,emice,1355553053,"I've never seen a pair of Beats or Skullcandy that were worth their selling price. Most people are trying to upgrade the earbuds that came with their portable device, while spending &lt;$50 and remaining unobtrusive for daily use. They get trapped by looking for a name that is marketed as premium.  There are manufacturers that make best in class products at higher price points, like Sennheiser, but at lower price points I start looking elsewhere. This coming from someone who has owned an externally amped pair of HD-580's since the late 90's. I wanted something small like the ear buds that came with my phone, but with better quality sound. I've tried the $20-$40 Sennheiser CX-200 and was unimpressed, and I hear the CX-495 is not much better.  After research and shopping I recently got a pair of ""made in China"" Soundmagic E30 for $38 shipped. I also considered the Meelectronics CW31 for $24. Neither of these headphones are for bass heads but both companies sell other models that trade accuracy for a bit more bass. The CW31 has a warmer sound vs. the E30's greater accuracy and detail, and both are canal phones/in ear monitors, so outside noise/possible danger is blocked. The fact that canal phones completely seal the opening allows them to produce better and louder bass than ear buds. Either of these or their bass heavier cousins (do some research for model #'s) beat the Beats® equivalents costing 2x as much.  If it is top fidelity in a tiny package your after, look into canal phones that use a balanced armature design like the Soundmagic PL50 for &lt;$60. These will sacrifice deep bass, but for mid-range frequencies and up, they are cleaner than the above mentioned phones. Once you get into &gt; $80 range, options really open up for in ear headphones. The Shure SE215 is a good value for $100, and it is doubtful $150 Beats in ear headphones come close to those.",®

More mutilation, more traumatized kids, more blood probably. Plus, the kids in China will be reminded of their fate everytime they grab a knife.

t5_2tkk1,blackmarketdolphins,1355579083,"I've been running more Gold matches testing this build. I did several without equipment and a few with equipment, and the results are satisfying. Equipping Adrenaline Mod and Warp Rounds (Phasic will work too, but not as well) is the key to putting him over the top.  Speccing out of S.Net shakes off the chains hold this guy back IMO. You pretty much can bumrush a spawn and with your awesome Vorcha dodge shoot everything in the face (that headshot damage...oh my). Once BL gets bumping and that 15% weapon damage bonus kicks in, you'll be pretty hard to kill and equally deadly. I'm ashamed that I'm liking this build at the moment. It's like playing an Infiltrator but I don't care that you can see me. I feel like yelling ""n0$©oP3iN y@ br@h"" to every Centurion and Collector Captain I see. It's such a silly build, but with a Harrier X, all things are possible.  Nuking spawns points is the most dangerous part since there's a gap in the BL and and when there's nothing (several Combat Engineers and Phantoms took advantage of that), so you can't be too reckless. It's actually turning out pretty well.   ",©

t5_2qh1i,Whytesmoke,1355600429,"Not a twin, but I know two sets of identical twins that go to my school. They switch all the time, and apparently nobody can tell them apart.  I think the most memorable one is when set A switched during 5th hour. One had debate (with me) and the other had band. So, while the philosophy-inclined twin 1 is sitting in the trumpet section pretending to play an instrument he's never practices with in his life, twin 2 is being forced to give a three-minute speech over legalised prostitution.

t5_2qkib,YYYY,1355604446,"Generic Roundup is just non-brand name glyphosate.  The Monsanto patent expired in September, 2000.    I wouldn't use it, and avoid buying crops sprayed with glyphosate.   Like DDT, we take some time to recognize the dangers of these ""miracle"" advances.  There are many ways to raise crops without it without [damaging your soil](http://www.motherjones.com/tom-philpott/2011/08/monsantos-roundup-herbicide-soil-damage). &gt;The heavy use of Monsanto's Roundup herbicide appears to be causing harmful changes in soil and potentially hindering yields of the genetically modified crops that farmers are cultivating  [It isn't as safe as we were told](http://www.ofa.org.au/papers/glyphosatereview.htm): &gt;Glyphosate is widely used in the mistaken belief that it is harmless, safe and readily breaks down leaving no residues.  [It has been implicated in endocrine disruption too](http://permaculturenews.org/2012/11/01/why-glyphosate-should-be-banned-a-review-of-its-hazards-to-health-and-the-environment/).  &gt;Endocrine disruption may well underlie many of the reproductive, teratogenic, and carcinogenic effects of glyphosate. The synthesis of sex hormones is disrupted by glyphosate and Roundup® in both males and females. Mouse and rat testicular Leydig cells (testosterone producing cells) have reduced testosterone levels as well as increased levels of aromatase, an enzyme complex that converts testosterone into oestrogen [28, 29]. Human placental cells, on the other hand, showed decreased aromatase expression [32]. All these imbalances were observed with concentrations well below agricultural dilutions, and effects were more pronounced with commercial formulations containing adjuvants.",®

The Elf on the Shelf®: A Christmas Tradition is the very special tool that **helps Santa know who to put on the Naughty** and Nice **list**. This interactive holiday hide-and-seek tradition is perfect for children and families of all ages.  &gt; &gt;The tradition begins when Santa sends his scout elves out to Elf Adoption Centers. Waiting for their families to bring them home, these patient elves hibernate until their family reads The Elf on the Shelf, gives their elf a very special name, and registers their adoption online. Once named, each scout elf will receive its Christmas magic and become a part of the family’s Christmas each and every year.   &gt; &gt;**Excellent listeners and even better observers, these scout elves are the eyes and ears of Santa Claus.** Although they cannot be touched, or else they may lose their magic, **the elf will always listen and relay messages back to Santa.** Taking in all the day-to-day activities around the house, no good deed goes unnoticed; these scout elves take their job seriously.  That is the official description on the website...   less cute..  more... umm... **creepy as fuck.**",®

t5_2qh1i,dominusUmbrae,1355612680,"Extensions for browsers These are not covered above so i'm going to give you a long list of the ones i have. COULD OP INCLUDE THESE IN HIS POST? OR COULD THIS POST BE SHARED SOME? i don't want this to be for nothing really. most of these are for chrome, possibly more. and BTW, if your computer is running 4 or less gb of RAM, you could experience slower but better browsing, and a lot of lag sometimes. recommend that if you do close all windows regularly, to stop background processes while chrome is closed - these eat up 1-2 gb RAM.  * Turn off the lights - useful for dimming page elements that aren't flash/video. * Adblock (in addition to adblock plus by the google team, this one allows you to block ads that may appear anyway, by making you select the page element - it'll see it, give you a slider to make the element look good by determining how much it needs to alter the page, and then reloads the page- however, can sometimes block important/useful things when this is implemented- if so, remove the page block and try to ignore the ad (it'll say how many things match the page element you're wanting to block)) * TabJump - allows you to see recently closed tabs and related tabs and frequently used tabs. * Hover zoom - why doesn't everyone have this already? if you're using it, make sure to check out the various options such as browser history and nsfw content. * Wolfram Alpha - type what you want solved into the extension, and it'll pull up a solution in a new tab. Make sure you're using adblock because the ads are annoying. * XMarks bookmarks- only useful if you're constantly switching between browser types and computers. relatively useless otherwise. * TabSplit- splits off all tabs to the right of the current one, not including the current one, into a new window to make things more manageable. * TooManyTabs for chrome - lets you send web pages into a little column much like the way bookmarks work, but this is for people who don't want to fool with bookmarks or who don't want to bookmark the page if they're just going to visit it a few more times instead of constantly. Has less organization than the bookmarks/folders system in chrome. * AppJump app launcher- if the newtab apps page just isn't your thing. * MuteTab- opens a window that takes a few seconds longer than i'd like it to, but it identifies which tabs are playing music and if told to, will attempt to stop/pause the music on a selected tab. NatGeo, i'm talking to you. * Screen Capture - lets you capture a certain part of the screen or the whole page or other things, without having to use printscreen and opening paint and cropping it perfectly and possibly losing image quality. * Google Dictionary - double click a word to search google for definitions. may not work with words that have more than one definition or street definitions/slang. can also (if shown in extensions bar) be clicked and typed into to define something- useful for when the unknown word is part of a link you don't want to click yet. * Look of Disapproval - pastes faces into your chat box, like the following : ಠ_ಠ, ಠ_ರೃ, ಥ_ಥ, ఠ_ఠ, ﴾͡๏̯͡๏﴿, ๏_๏, ಠ▃ಠ, (•‿•), Ծ_Ծ, ¬_¬, ¯(°_o)/¯, (✌ﾟ∀ﾟ)☞, ╚(•⌂•)╝, t(-_-t), t(ツ)_/¯, ◔_◔, ლ(ಠ_ಠლ), (/ﾟДﾟ)/ ; note, at least 3 of these faces came out wrong here. recommend you get the extension and see what they were if they did indeed come out wrong. * Facebook notifications - so you don't need to keep facebook open to get/see notifications. * XBox Live Dashboard beta- if you have and xbox 360 account and receive important messages through xbox live, like your friends asking you to come over or the billing team telling you you've got 1 month left- this also lets you see who's online. * Web of Trust - puts a circle next to any links it can. the greener, the safer; the redder, the worse. trustworthiness, reliability, child safety, and privacy are the determining factors. surprisingly *most* porn sites are still green. :D * Speed tracer by google - not sure what it does or how it's useful but it's got graphs and stuff. some other people may know what these mean and how to use/interpret them; not bad to have even if you don't use it because it doesn't use RAM unless you run it. * Click&amp;Clean - useful for a lot of stuff. sometimes i worry about it though, if it's something that collects info. *note* do NOT get the Hide My Ass extension, it's bad. * FVD free video downloader - downloads basically everything except youtube. * Youtube downloader - this is an Opera web browser extension. all the others have been chrome extensions; if you plan to use this, i recommend you get adblock and ghostery for opera as well. * Better History - chrome. it sorts history and is really good overall. compresses by type and time. lets you search for certain things and delete all of one type or many if you want, or all... * bing wallpaper for google homepage - honestly it's just for shits and giggles. i don't even use the google homepage, just the omnibar in a new tab. Other people seem to use the actual homepage sometimes so it's nice to have. * Cookies - lets you see the browser cookies, what type, etc. may let you delete all of them if you so choose. * Facebook Me-Gusta button - just for shits and giggles. like = me gusta, unlike = ""Don't Want!"", and comment = herpderp. * Hide FB questions - hides facebook questions. pretty damn good at it too, havent seen any in months. (aside from survey  questions) * IE tab for chrome - opens the page in an internet explorer tab. useful for only a few things - 1 : Bitmap image support (.bmp), and 2 : watching videos that require minimum age, like 18+ on youtube, when the chrome version of youtube fucking LOCKS SAFETY MODE ON FOR MONTHS. THANKS CHROME SUPPORT TEAM. I'M ONLY 40 SOMETHING ON MY ACCOUNT. (16 irl, but the videos i'm talking about are from sxephil, sourcefed, and sometimes links from here- so news and reality.) * Magic Actions For Youtube - basically like RES, but YES. lol. * Quicknote - make browser notes quickly and store them. * Reddit companion - 99% of time works to show the link name at the top of the page if you linked from reddit. allows direct sharing to reddit with a couple clicks. * Reddithider - hides stuff after you've rated it. conflicts with default reddit options and if both are running it won't hide anything at all. i'm just too lazy to uninstall this one. * Smooth Scrollerator - scroll smoothly. * Youtube ratings preview - shows ratings preview with the green/red bar in the thumbnail of the video.",✌

t5_2qh2p,Dudesan,1355619118,"&gt;I base my knowledge on New Testament because I was raised catholic  Remember, many Christians find it more comfortable to believe in a god who doesn't condone, command or commit murder, slavery, rape, child abuse, animal abuse, arson, torture, ritual mutilation, fratricide, patricide, matricide, infanticide, genocide, and so on than to believe in one who does.   Unfortunately, since the Bible (Old Testamant and New) is pretty clear about Yahweh's position on these things, holding a belief in Loving Hippie Jesus™ requires ignoring huge portions of it. Or just never reading it in the first place, which seems to be the most popular option.  Well, let's see what Jesus has to say about that:  &gt;“Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished.  (Matthew 5:17-18, NIV)  Some Christians claim that his death and resurrection ""fulfill"" this. That is bullshit for one simple reason: last time I checked, Heaven and Earth haven't passed away.  Jesus also made his views on people ""picking and choosing"" quite clear:  &gt;[Jesus] answered them, “And why do you break God’s commandment because of your tradition? For God said:    *Honor your father and your mother;* and, *The one who speaks evil of father or mother must be put to death.*  &gt; But you say, ‘Whoever tells his father or mother, “Whatever benefit you might have received from me is a gift committed to the temple”—  he does not have to honor his father.’ In this way, you have revoked God’s word because of your tradition. Hypocrites! Isaiah prophesied correctly about you when he said:    &gt;These people honor Me with their lips, but their heart is far from Me.  They worship Me in vain, teaching as doctrines the commands of men.”  (Matthew 15:3-9, NIV)   Looks like Jesus has quite a bit to say about people who ignore commandments, in fact. But maybe it's just Matthew?  &gt;It is easier for heaven and earth to disappear than for the least stroke of a pen to drop out of the Law.  (Luke 16:17, NIV)  Okay, so Jesus is a bust. Let's see what the Epistles have to say about the Mosaic Code:  &gt; If you really keep the royal law found in Scripture, “Love your neighbor as yourself,” you are doing right.  But if you show favoritism, you sin and are convicted by the law as lawbreakers. For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it.   (James 2:8-10, NIV)  &gt;All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness,  (2 Timothy 3:16)  &gt;Do we, then, nullify the law by this faith? Not at all! Rather, we uphold the law.  (Romans 3:31)  &gt;Know this first of all, that *there is no prophecy of scripture that is a matter of personal interpretation*, for no prophecy ever came through human will; but rather human beings moved by the holy Spirit spoke under the influence of God.""  (2 Peter 1:20-21 NAB)  ----  Well, shit.   This problem disappears quite quickly if you assert that most of the Bible is hogwash, and you only care about the good parts. If you prefer to cling to it as an inspired document, vague mutterings about ""context"" or about Jesus abolishing the old Law won't get you anywhere. ",™

When hauling empty cans and containers, you are essentially transporting air.  The transport cost often is the single most expensive item in the recycling process. It can mean the difference between a profitable and a lossy cycle. Since gas prices are going up all the time and recycling collection is paid by municipal taxation, you want the truck to be as heavy as possible on each trip; the content is weighted at the depot and there is a price per ton of material.  BTW this is the main reason why styrofoam (polystyrene) is not recycled in most places - the weight/volume ratio makes it a losing equation ^[source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polystyrene#Recycling).",♻

t5_2qh1i,tossedyonder,1355661613,"Be gentle by default, ask ""harder/softer"" (especially with regards to nipples, the clitoris, and finger/penis insertions), pay attention to how her body responds, and **don't get so wrapped up in your own head that you forget where you are.**  A good tip is to wait until she starts to visibly enjoy something you're doing and then ask [if you're doing it right] or [if she wants you to do it harder/softer] or [if she likes that™]. She'll be desperate to get you to keep doing what you're doing which will boost your confidence and encourage her to be vocal. Just don't do this when she's on the edge of orgasm.  I would also say stick to missionary (cowgirl positions rely more heavily on practiced angles and doggy-style can be high-pressure when you're new to the whole thing), but if she wants to change it up then do it. **Enter her slowly** the first time.  When switching to any kind of position try to strike a balance between maintaining contact and actually getting into the required position. E.g. if she asks you to lay down don't just flop into the supine position.  If you know your strength and you're sure you can comfortably lift or support her body don't be afraid to do so if the opportunity presents itself.  Be passionate: not too timid but not overly aggressive. Use your body language and movements to convey that you *need* her.  Edit: I gave you one specific tip above and many others are posted in this thread. Don't worry too much about specifics. As all girls are different - you can't know what to expect when you get down to it. She may want a finger in her ass from start to finish, she may not want to kiss you at all, she may just blow you and call it a night. Go with the flow, don't worry about tricks, don't rush things, be zen about your performance before and after, and may the force be with you. ^^^^^Always.",™

t5_2rxrw,LeifEriksonisawesome,1355699369,"I commented on the behaviors you mentioned as attraction.  &gt; ♂LeifEriksonisawesome  I once got exited because this girl started to exhibit some signs of attraction towards me. However, I was tentative, and noticed that this is how she interacts with the guys she is comfortable with. She, mor likely than not, had entirely plutonic feelings toward me. At least she is more comfortable with me, though. That's a plus. Anyway, point is. It is too damn risky, girls can ask me out more often as far as I am concerned.  Then regarding questions about my love life, things get even more complicated. A girl can be trying to make conversation, i.e. she isn;t saying this to you specifically, or she is trying to gauge interest for a friend( which is great, if the friend could actually be direct.) Or she just may treat you as a plutonic friend, which would be a case of her not wanting you to ask her out. I inquire about my friends love life because it is something which , if they have one, is a good topic of discussion among friends. ' It's a complicated issue.  **Edit: The aforementioned signs of attraction were**  Now beginning to be comfortable with sitting next to me. Greeting me  Touching my arms in conversation. Once or twice shoulder  More comfortable with asking me for help, for a topic in which there are several other guys nearby with the same reputation for aptitude in that area.  Asking about lovelife(separate from the above situation)   Also, cool. I have a guy tag now. ",♂

t5_2qh13,ThereIsAThingForThat,1355702316,"I don't know if the umbrella unions also include what we call ""Yellow"" unions though. We have ""Red"" unions, those are the ones arranging strikes etc. Yellow unions have lower payments for the members, but they don't have the right to strike etc, so their bargaining power is pretty limited, which is why most of the Yellow unions have lower everything as minimum, which is a pretty big topic in Denmark since the people not paying the Red unions (by going to the Yellow ones) get the benefits of the Red unions anyways.  Actually, the Chevrolet Spark (the car I drive) has an ECOTEC® 1.2L DOHC 4-Cylinder MFI Engine in the US, so you do have 1.2 engines.  But yeah, the insurance is fucking crazy. Because I'm a male under the age of 25, I need to pay the highest insurance payment in Denmark (despite having had a drivers license for 2 years now (minimum age to get a drivers license in Denmark is 18) without having been in any accidents, ever), with Females paying less (which will soon be illegal, thank god). But I could drive my current car (which is in my moms name, costing her ~$70/month), pay ~$300/month for the payment, and get a car that goes an average of 20km per liter (~47mpg if I calculate correctly). If I should have a chance of managing insurance payments, I could get a '97 VW Polo 1,4, costing me ~$3000/year in insurance. Of course, it would cost way more in maintenance, gas (rated at 35mpg instead of the 58 mine is rated at), and that's with liability only, and a copayment of ~$1000. So I have no trouble basically ""cheating"" the insurance company by having it in my parents name.",®
t5_2qh03,majoroutage,1355702540,"&gt;Firstly, they do not have an established pedigree outside of PC gaming. They aren't making the steam box for PC gamers, we already have our multi-generational rigs with their upgrade cycles, nothing is going to change there.  Remember, Valve's goal here is not to sell physical machines - it's to get the HTPC seen as a viable gaming/multimedia platform. The Steambox™ can flop, Linux support can flop, and the Big Picture concept can still be a booming success.  PC gaming, on a physical level, is a pretty solitary experience. One system, one player. Consoles, on the other hand, are much more social in that regard. You can get a group together and play split-screen on one single machine. This is their biggest hurdle - getting enough of these kinds of titles made for the PC platform. And finding some unique features for them.  And really, if nothing else, Steam still has one big thing going for them: You only need to own one copy of a game, and you can play it at your desk, or on your TV.",™

t5_2qh1i,60Hurtz,1355732786,"I began my career as a recording engineer at a Big Time LA Recording Studio™. I started as a runner (aka gofer, lackey, virgin sacrifice, etc) and this was my favorite among many weird things I had to do...  The studio owner wants to buy a joke gift for an artist working there. Sure, a dlido, why not? You so cray! And who's the lucky dude on runner duty that day?   Oh yeah.  I was quickly briefed and drove to this seedy porn shop on Santa Monica. Now, I'm a man of the world. I've been to a few porn shops in my day. Hell, I've even bought a dildo before, though it was with the end user that particular time. On the day in question, however, I was buying a dildo for a stranger. Not just a stranger, but a client. Not just a client, but a singer who's pretty well known and whom I would see everyday at the studio. My job, nay, my *career and entire future* hinged upon this purchase.   Choose wisely, return a hero.   Choose poorly...  Before me stands a wall. A Great Wall Of Dildos. It spans as far as the eye can see in every direction. Gigantic dongs of every color, shape, and size loom before me. They disappear into the horizon as they approach the vanishing points to my left and right. Electrified monsters disappear into the clouds that obscure the uppermost crests of the GWOD. I need a plan. I begin by bookending the extreme ends of the spectrum, envisioning a kind of Uncanny Valley of Dildos.  Too realistic: Creepy. Too unrealistic: Not That Funny (even unrecognizable, in some cases... Gadzooks, the things some people will stick in their holes...). I need to find that sweet, sweet compromise between porn and comedy.  Applying this new formula to the dizzying dildo display quickly yielded a winner: The Man O' War. Shaped realistically, veins and all, but just way, WAY too big. Plus it had a flattened ballsac which I prophesied to be a great way to prop it upright on a table like some kind of turgid CB radio microphone. ""Breaker Niner, Breaker Niner, cum in, CUM IN!"".  This thing was gonna be *loads* of fun!  I grab it, pay my final respects to the GWOD, and get in line behind some guy who is renting a couple DVD's (this was quite a few years ago) and who is also purchasing a ""Large tub of Elbow Grease, please."". Jesus, dude, it's like 2 o'clock on a Tuesday... awesome! Anyway, I got to the counter and I dropped the Man O' War down with the confidence of a man who has just made the decision to never again make a sound when he farts. It made a glorious din as it hit the glass counter, a low rumble like the blackest thunder storm closing in from just over yonder, silencing all nearby wildlife and sucking all of the oxygen from the air around you. I swear it shook the store.  The clerk took one look at the cock-lossus laid before him (surely no mortal had before purchased this vile instrument of unadulterated rend...!?!), took one look at my 5'8"", 130 pound frame, and inquired, ""Uh, is that it?"".  ""That's all, man. Take Amex?""",™

I won't go into each one, but I'll gladly find the statistics for gun ownership and homicide rates for whichever one you want to use as a reference and then I will give you additional statistics about other European countries which will show you that an armed populous does not equate to more crime.   Japan: &gt;Of the many reasons suggested by researchers for the high Japanese suicide rate, one of the most startling is weapons control. Japanese scholars Mamon Iga and Kichinosuke Tatai argue that one reason Japan has a suicide problem is that people have little sympathy for (p.39)suicide victims. Iga and Tatai suggest that the lack of sympathy (and hence the lack of social will to deal with a high suicide rate) is based the Japanese' feelings of insecurity and consequent lack of empathy. They trace the lack of empathy to a 'dread of power'. That dread is caused in part by the awareness that a person cannot count on others for help against violence or against authority. In addition, say Iga and Tatai, the dread of power stems from the people being forbidden to possess swords or firearms for self-defense.[122] Stated another way, firearms prohibition is part of a culture that subordinates the individual to society. When the individual finds himself not fitting into social expectations, self-destruction may often seem appropriate, since in a conflict between the individual and society, society is, by definition, always right. It is interesting to note that the overall violent death rates (counting both murders and suicides) in many of the developed countries are approximately the same. America has a high murder rate, but a relatively low suicide rate. Japan and Switzerland have very low murder rates, but suicide rates twice the American level. Seymour Martin Lipset notes the high suicide rates in Japan and western European countries and speculates that 'psychopaths there turn it on themselves'.[123]  &gt;[Copyright © 1993 Asia Pacific Law Review, City Polytechnic of Hong Kong; David B.

t5_2qh18,Retardditard,1355771036,"Well, you claim to study the stuff, so how would you have responded to him?  And his first reply begins:  &gt;No, Intel's multiple dispatch works like this: if cpu.arch is P4: call p4_optimized_func else if cpu.family is 6 and cpu.arch is CORE_2_DUO: call c2d_optimized_func else if cpu.family is 6 and cpu.arch is NEHALEM or later: call nehalem_optimized_func else: /* not sure what this family/arch is, use function that will always work now and in the future */  &gt;Now, which of the above paths should be used for Sledgehammer? How do you know? Which should be used for Barcelona? How do you know? Which for Steamroller? How do you know?  Do you consider those rhetorical questions? I certainly did. Anyway.  - ""No"" may be more technically correct if 'all the petals of the two distinct branches' are accounted for; however, conceptually, my statement was and still is reasonably valid 'to the trunk' of the matter, stated another way:  Psuedo-basic, anyone should be able to understand, a much more accurate/precise p-code example is provided below, courtesy of Charng-Da Lu -- who credits Agner Fog! :)      If (""GenuineIntel"" = processor.vendor) Then 'Wavicle 'conveniently forgot' this part         maximum_optimization_occurs_here!         'or, to 'complete' Wavicle's p-code:         'Wavicle's pseudo-code *would* go here... ignoring incorrectness     Else '**non-Intel processors get this**:         minimal_if-any_optimization 'meaning, perhaps, P4-era optimizations     End If  - He omitted the **conditional block testing for vendor ID string, which fully encapsulates his supposed dispatch psuedo-code block**. It was and still appears to be deliberately cherry-picked, and I fully realize logical fallacies can be used intentionally or obliviously.  - The processor-related dispatch questions involve much complexity, because there are multiple dispatch routines involved, specific to certain operations, libraries, compilers, and so forth. Obviously, due to how he provided the p-code, and my understanding of the actual dispatching routines, his questions had precisely the answer I originally gave, ""none of the above. check CPUID feature bits, of course."" Of course! As he used the word ""should"", so I provided the proper ""should"" answer. Then proceeded to tell me ""how"" he believes it is actually done and ""how"" Intel, Lu, Fog, and I aren't correct.  ANYWAY! As Intel instructs:  &gt;By using the CPUID feature flags to determine processor features, your software can detect and avoid incompatibilities introduced by the addition or removal of processor features.  &gt; **Do not assume that a given family or model has any specific feature. For example, do not assume the family value 5  (Pentium processor) means there is a floating-point unit on-chip. Use the feature flags for this determination.**  &gt;Do not assume processors with higher family or model numbers have all the features of a processor with a lower family or  model number. For example, a processor with a family value of 6 (P6 family processor) may not necessarily have all the  features of a processor with a family value of 5.   Taken from Intel's *Intel® Processor Identification and the CPUID Instruction* manual, link below, for your convenience.  Wavicle continues:  &gt;Now, what process would Intel have to go through to find the answers to these? They'd have to do a whole lot of benchmarking of AMD products, right? Why do you think this should be compulsory?  Reality according to Wavicle:  &gt;The paths ARE **NOT** OPTIMIZED BY FEATURE, they are optimized by ARCHITECTURE.  While the fact of the matter is that optimizations are designed/performed at multiple levels, from architecture-specific, to feature-specific, to model-specific. [Demonstrated here, apparently maintained by Charng-Da Lu, Senior Research Scientist, Center For Computational Research, University of Buffalo](http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~charngda/icc_cpu_dispatch.html) &amp; [Demonstrated by Agner Fog, professor of CS, University of Copenhagen College for Engineering](http://aceshardware.freeforums.org/cpuid-family-bits-added-because-of-flaw-in-intel-compiler-t428.html) &amp; [Apparently Intel agrees!](http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/processors/processor-identification-cpuid-instruction-note.html) Architecture detection is a prerequisite towards the proper enumeration of CPUID feature flags(preceded by additional sequences to check for existence of CPUID itself, page 17 of Intel's *Intel® Processor Identification and the CPUID Instruction*).  Sure, I could have responded with something like: Intel could read the copies of the various AMD processor architecture technical docs(references) they likely have abundant copies of. *or maybe:* Whatever process Intel has gone through before, ya know, when it implemented AMD64. **RTFM!** Which is in-line with what Intel suggests. And I'm certain that is(and has been) the case, regardless of the degree(s) of optimization AMD processors receive. Writing a compiler for AMD processors while ignoring AMD's architecture technical documentation could certainly lead to executables that don't work properly or at all.  I don't think it should be compulsory, but I think it's the right action, and Intel should fairly optimize(I've heard AMD has suggested numerous resolutions, such as compensating Intel generously to maintain up-to-date optimizations for AMD processors(not their first choice), but Intel flatly refuses!) because it's the right thing to do. For the sake of consumers that cross boundaries, and for the sake of Intel's clients/partners that sell software to consumers, regardless of processor brands -- it's the right thing to do. For consumers that abhor Intel and refuse to purchase Intel hardware -- it's the right thing to do. I strongly believe that we consumers should expect nothing less than the best in exchange for our fair compensation. We deserve that much. A disclaimer is not enough when I scan my PC and find dozens of instances -- some assuredly tainted binaries. I certainly never received a disclaimer upon installation of the respective programs.  Back to Wavicle:  &gt;As your own link says:  &gt;&gt;In other words, they claim that they are optimizing for specific processor models rather than for specific instruction sets. If true, this gives Intel an argument for not supporting AMD processors properly.  &gt; Unfortunately he then goes on to state a blatant lie:  &gt; &gt; But it also means that all software developers who use an Intel compiler have to recompile their code and distribute new versions to their customers every time a new Intel processor appears on the market.  More cherry-picking and fracturing! Wavicle clearly has no interest in discussing this topic like a mature, reasonable adult. There's no lie, blatant or otherwise, when you consider Agner's **entire** paragraph:  &gt;In other words, they claim that they are optimizing for specific processor models rather than for specific instruction sets. **If true, this gives Intel an argument for not supporting AMD processors properly. But it also means that all software developers who use an Intel compiler have to recompile their code and distribute new versions to their customers every time a new Intel processor appears on the market.** Now, this was three years ago. What happens if I try to run a program compiled with an old version of Intel's compiler on the newest Intel processors? You guessed it: It still runs the optimal code path. But the reason is more difficult to guess: Intel have manipulated the CPUID family numbers on new processors in such a way that they appear as known models to older Intel software. I have described the technical details [elsewhere.](http://aceshardware.freeforums.org/cpuid-family-bits-added-because-of-flaw-in-intel-compiler-t428.html)  **Bold makes good glue.** That link re-iterates Fog's original, factual, &amp; unconvoluted meaning.  I concluded Wavicle was being deliberately deceptive. Wouldn't you? I guess it could be that Wavicle is just a liar. Sure, yea, I poked fun at him with the joke about inability to program ""Hello World"" in BASIC because of this apparent inability to understand and effectively use logic.  One last fallacious tid-bit, courtesy of Wavicle:  &gt; Intel specifically says that last case is there so that developers do NOT have to recompile their code, a fall-back-always-works case is always available. Currently, AMD always falls into this last category.  The problem there is he used the word ""always"", but this is becoming tiresome. If people actually care about the truth, I strongly believe they can and, with right effort, will find it. The above links should help. ;)  If you find Wavicle's use of intentional irrelevancies(red herrings), vagueness/ambiguity(hedging), and over all -- how he wonderfully achieves 'explaining', essentially, nothing(unaccepted enthymemes and rhetoric) beyond spewing his own personal vitriol(over trivial objections), baseless judgments(avoiding any burden of proof), and numerous contradictions(shifting ground) applause worthy, that's probably just wishful thinking. Simultaneously committing so many and so varied logical fallacies(classic names provided for your edification) it would take untold hours to sort them all out. Perhaps the worst fallacy of all is that of preaching unobtainable perfection -- that because Intel might be incapable of 'perfectly optimizing' for non-Intel compilers that Intel should just not even try.  I wish you success in your studies, jmknsd. With accumulation of working knowledge and cultivation of expertise I hope you'll be able to dismantle the facades and fallacies created and perpetrated by mischievous punks.  Lunch time!",®

t5_2qs6r,nationaltelesystems,1355775598,"UNIVERGE®	SV8000 Series Fulfilling the promise of UNIVERGE®360 It’s all about change And preparing for it Our working environment is rapidly changing, with organizations of all types continually looking for new ways of generating revenue, controlling costs and optimizing productivity. What’s more, the rate of change is accelerating, thanks to the development of new technologies.These advanced technologies provide innovative ways of handling new and increasing commercial and economic demands. Communication and information technology strategies must now be converged across all media types – not just data, but also voice and video. Communication technologies (voice, email, instant messaging, SMS, IP telephony, voicemail, video-conferencing) and their underlying networks such as the Internet, broadband, Wi-Fi and 3G, are the keys that drive many of these new strategies. These are supported by a vast range of desktop, mobile and handheld devices. Although technology is an enabler for organizational improvement, the real challenge facing businesses is to embrace and harness the potential benefits of the technology available. The technology must give practical, easy to use support, and not add extra complexity. It must be available to and used by everyone, not just isolated islands within the business. And it must empower individuals and teams, enabling them to achieve their business objectives. At NEC, we understand these challenges and offer advanced solutions to help businesses meet and surpass their operational and business objectives. We call this holistic approach UNIVERGE360, and it’s designed to efficiently, and cost- effectively prepare organizations for the opportunities available today, and for those of tomorrow. By uniting all business communication devices, (including mobile handsets, PDAs, soft phones and other IP devices) UNIVERGE360 accelerates decision-making and dramatically improves customer responsiveness. And, by bringing together business data through a service-oriented architecture, information is instantly accessed and transformed into real knowledge.The result? You’re truly in the driver’s seat. With UNIVERGE360 you’re in the driver’s seat.  Small, medium and large businesses SV8000 Series Unified Communications Mobility (IP) DECT Voice over WLAN Fixed Mobile Convergence Management &amp; Control Moves-Adds-Changes Expense control Call Accounting Reachability Contact Center Voicemail + IVR Calendar integration Attendant/Operator Microsoft integration Collaboration Presence Messaging The UNIVERGE SV8000 Series from NEC creates new ways of generating revenue and increasing customer responsiveness, while simultaneously improving efficiency and reducing costs. Designed to deliver next-generation, open standards-based solutions, it is your bridge to the future and protects your existing telephone infrastructure investment while providing a migration path to pure IP. With the SV8000 series, all types of communication methods are suppor ted, whether TDM, IP, video, wired or wireless. Connectivity Multiple sites VoIP SIP Migration  Your business benefits Reduce operating costs Converged network The SV8000 Series provides converged communications – data, multimedia and voice over one network, which means just one set of wiring costs. One network also consolidates traffic onto existing circuits, which allows you to leverage bandwidth and software applications. It provides a single, common management system for networked systems, and can reduce long distance/ internal toll charges. Server-based architecture The SV8000 Series includes modular core and optional hardware and software components – all of which are server- based, so it fits seamlessly into your IT environment.The heart of the system is the IP communication server, which is based on a true Client-Server design that does not require the purchase of traditional hardware to support analogue stations or trunk circuits. Central management The SV8000 Series peripheral devices enable you to manage equipment in branch offices from one central location or from any web-enabled workstation.This eliminates the need for local network management staff and therefore reduces the total cost of network ownership. Distributed office A distributed office location environment reduces the operating expenses incurred in managing disparate equipment by consolidating them into one system. Staff can work remotely (on the road or at home) with access to all corporate voice and data resources; all of which means that you can increase your labor pool without the cost of adding office space. Improve business continuity High availability The SV8000 Series offers unparalleled reliability and continues NEC’s reputation for quality. The SV8000 Series is ideal for mission-critical situations such as defense, government and 24hr services. Advanced fault diagnosis, uninterruptible power supply, remote telephony survivability, clustered survivability, and many other fail-over capabilities all ensure the best availability and operational continuity in the industry. Voice quality High voice quality is achieved by optimizing specific functions in hardware and software.The high performance of the line- echo cancellation eliminates echo signals. Quality of Service parameters prioritize voice traffic and, depending on the individual communication channel, the appropriate voice volume level is automatically and centrally managed by the ser ver. Security The SV8000 Series provides secure communications, including voice encryption, a variety of authentication methods, detailed audit logging, data integrity services and bandwidth management services. Increase productivity Fully featured The SV8000 Series gives users access to advanced telephony features that enhance their productivity, in addition to supporting many additional multimedia applications. Value-added applications A rich suite of advanced applications improves efficiency and business processes using voice, email, instant messaging, SMS, IP telephony, voicemail and video-conferencing. Mobility Mobility enables flexible working practices and allows users to work smarter. Collaboration tools will make your employees more productive and more responsive to customers’ inquiries. Wherever users are located, they will be more accessible using IP phones,WLAN and web-based applications. Manage growth Scalable architecture The SV8000 Series incorporates a very scalable, open architecture with almost unlimited networking capabilities: ideal for businesses needing just 25 to 50 lines as well as for those larger corporations that need thousands of lines. In fact, a group of independent SV8000 servers can be networked to handle up to 200,000 extensions.This unique expansion capability is essential in large businesses where geographic, technical and commercial change is continuous and with new offices and departments constantly emerging, growing and integrating. Migration and networking The SV8000 Series can network with your existing NEC and third party systems, so IP technology can be introduced gradually to protect existing investments. Open interfaces The system is also future proof. It uses a state-of-the art open interface so new services and applications can be easily integrated - no matter how fast technology advances. The growing trend Five years ago less than 10% of new telephone lines were IP or IP- enabled. Since then that proportion has grown to 90%. Energy savings Power consumption is less than any conventional enterprise communication platform or PBX system thanks to the SV8000 Series’ state-of-the-art design.  Unified Communications Powerful applications that improve business processes NEC understands that today’s businesses are looking for new ways to manage change more efficiently and retain customers through high quality service.The suite of powerful applications supported by SV8000 Series includes: Expense control suite This fully web-based, modular suite of applications provides call accounting for all your voice calls includingVoIP. You can set budgets for individuals, departments, projects, receive a warning when these are almost exceeded, and automatically restrict service class when a budget is exceeded. Operator communications A PC-based operator console enables your receptionist to provide service that is vastly superior to using an ordinary console. For example, he or she can see and answer priority callers first, see who is on hold, and create multiple queues to differentiate callers.What’s more, for optimum efficiency, he or she can see the extension status before callers are transferred. • Microsoft’s® Office Communications Server (OCS) • Management applications • Personal communications environments • Contact center tools • Voicemail and Unified Messaging • Cost control tools • Advanced operator consoles • IP multimedia softphone • Virtual PC architecture and VoIP Microsoft’s Office Communications Server (OCS) This application seamlessly integrates Microsoft Office with your telephone system. It provides presence awareness within the desktop, which eliminates delays in locating people, who can then communicate in real-time via Instant Messaging, Audio and Web Collaboration as well as video-conferencing. Remote users can also take advantage without requiringVirtual Private Networking. And to keep things safe and secure, all transactions are encr ypted so you can use IM ser vices from MSN, AOL, or Yahoo! In addition to OCS, you can also have full integration with Microsoft Exchange, which provides Unified Messaging and Outlook Voice Access to e-mail inboxes via any phone – the Auto Attendant ensures automatic call routing. Management applications A suite of user-friendly tools for easy communications system management, including configuration, cost reporting, budget control, and security. And because it is modular, we can assemble and design a package that fits your needs precisely.  ",®

t5_2qhfj,eratner15,1355779343,"You could use the game Monopoly to illustrate the economy and its cycles.   From Bridgewater -  In a capitalist economy, cycles of expansions in credit and contractions in credit drive economic cycles and they occur for perfectly logical reasons.  Each sequence is not pre-destined to repeat in exactly the same way nor to take 6 exactly the same amount of time, though the patterns are similar, for logical reasons.  For example,  if you  understand the game of Monopoly®, you can pretty well understand credit and economic cycles.  Early in the game of Monopoly®, people have a lot of cash and few hotels, and it pays to convert cash into hotels.  Those who have more hotels make more money. Seeing this, people tend to convert as much cash as possible into property in order to profit from making other players give them cash.    So as the game progresses, more hotels  are acquired, which creates more need for cash (to pay the bills of landing on someone else’s property with  lots of hotels on it) at the same time as many folks have run down their cash to buy hotels. When they are  caught needing cash, they are forced to sell their hotels at discounted prices.  So early in the game, “property  is king” and later in the game, “cash is king.”  Those who are best at playing the game understand how to hold  the right mix of property and cash, as this right mix changes.   http://www.bwater.com/Uploads/FileManager/research/how-the-economic-machine-works/How-the-Economic-Machine%20Works--A-Template-for-Understanding-What-is-Happening-Now-Ray-Dalio-Bridgewater.pdf",®

t5_2s5oq,robot-b,1355781646,"Part 2  Meals Breakfast   	4 eggs.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU_B3QNu_Ks – follow the King’s recipe and you will enjoy your eggs.  I am a bit cheeky and put a few sprinkles of grated cheese in there.  Ronnie Coleman used to have this low fat cheese he put in there.   	1 cup of oats, with 1 cup of water, microwave for 2mins   	Fruit (I usually have orange or banana)   	Cup of black tea, no sugar   	Multi-vitamin/mineral   	Flaxseed oil / fish oil    Recently I have started to eat low-fat vanilla yoghurt with it, basically a big spoon of goop, then a huge spoon of yoghurt on top and smash it down.   Every other meal 	2 chicken breasts (better protein and less fat than thighs) cooked in olive oil   	Season with whatever, I go back and forth between salt and pepper, that bodybuilder guy Shannon sticks to chilli.  I was using peppersteak seasoning for a bit   	Vegetable – I go for spinach or broccoli but any leafy green vegetable will be fine.  Carrot, brussel sprouts can also be good options.  Frozen vegetables are also a good option   	If you are struggling to eat it, maybe put cheese or BBQ sauce or something.    Royalty Option (dinner) 	Porterhouse steak, 400-500g   	Green vegetables   	Pasta   (I did this when I was working, I think it is more of a changeup from eating chicken all the time but last two years I have not been doing it.  Red meat has creatine and good fatty acids so it is good to include).  Pasta is added here because you want to be full so that you don’t need to cook again before bed.  Gym food   	1 hour before – normal chicken meal   	30 mins before – whey protein with water   	Immediately after session – whey protein with water and 1 tea spoon of brown sugar   	Immediately after / &lt; 30mins of session – pint of whole cream milk and normal chicken meal.    I have stuck to this diet with pretty minimal changes for the last 3 or 4 years and while my results have not been spectacular I am slowly improving.  GYM There are a few approaches here.  You can do the bodybuilder approach of isolation splits over 4-5 days of medium volume with medium weight, or you can do a variation of ‘starting strength’ which is low volume, high weight compound-focussed programme.  Both are good, and I think you can have good results on both.  The big thing that is very hard to overcome, is that depending on your goals you have to do different things. If you want to be super strong, until you get to years into your training, you will not gain in size notably.  The workout you have to do is low volume and max weight with sudden, explosive movements (and the associated shoulder and knee problems). Bodybuilders are not weightlifters, they are bodybuilders.  The way bodybuilding works is medium volume with medium weight, straining the muscle and forcing mass amounts of blood in there, resulting in millions of tiny muscle rips that get repaired and get bigger over time.  Watch this video, it was really a good summation of the philosophy behind bodybuilding.  Sure Greene is roided up to his eyeballs, but the technique is perfect.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8wZNGL4iA4  He is curling about 15KG and struggling, when I do a similar exercise I use 5 or 6KG.  So what you want to aim for is perfect technique.  That means dropping the weight down, until you will likely find that your technique is fine, and the first 2 sets will be relatively ‘easy’, but the 3rd and especially 4th will be torture.  You do not want to be ever swinging your body (for example shoulder work) so that it allows you to get the weight going through momentum; isolation exercises are never about mass weight.  Speed of the workouts is always a hard thing.  I believe you should try and keep each session below an hour but you do not want to zing through the workouts.  I generally do a count of 2 up and 4 down.  The negative movement in a lot of exercises (like bench presses) is where all the action happens.  Also, you should never lock out your elbows or knees – the idea is that you keep the tension on the muscle all the time (particularly bench, the presses, raises, squats).  Exercises such as bench, if done properly, will have a fairly limited ROM.  Your shoulder blades should be pinched together, and as you do not lock your arms, you do not extend very far.  But, your chest should be on fire if done properly.  Below is what I started off on, a good friend of mine gave this to me, and I think there is a lot of merit in this kind of ‘general’ workout before moving into what I am currently doing: JARDINE WORKOUTS!!!  Week 1 &amp; 2; - shoulder press 1set 8reps. - upright rows 1set 8reps   - bench press 1set 8reps. - squats 1set 10reps   - wide grip chin ups to back (pull up so the chinup bar touches the back of your neck) 1set 8reps   - leg raises OR leg push outs OR situps 2sets 15reps**   ** abs really need doing everyday, and you could also probably do much more than 30 reps. so its up to u, just don't burn all your energy for growin!!!    Week 3; - shoulder press 1set 8reps. - upright rows 1set 8reps   - bench press 1set 8reps. + straight arm pull overs 1set 12reps    - squats 1set 10reps   - wide grip chin ups to back 1set 8reps   - leg raises/situps 2sets 15reps    STRAIGHT ARM PULL OVER: brilliant for upper body; chest, tris, lats and serrata (side abs). 1. lay down back on a flat bench. 2. grab a dumbell in both hands with arms straight, above your face. 3. lower the weight KEEPING YOUR ARMS STRAIGHT so that your arms are in line with your body, parallel to the floor. 4. now raise the weight back up to above your face, keeping your arms straight.  Week 4; - shoulder press. - upright rows.    - bench press. - straight arm pull overs.    - squats.   - wide grip chin ups to back 1set 8reps   - leg raises/situps 2sets 20reps    PROGRESSIVE TRAINING&gt;&gt; from this week, apply progressive weight use to your training. that means 2sets when doing weight exercises from now on. basically it means gradually incresing the weight you use for the exercise - but not in one hit!  eg: using 25kgs. 1st set; 8reps. 2nd set; 6reps   (*next session*) 1st set; 8reps. 2nd set; 7reps   (*next session*) 1st set; 8reps. 2nd set; 8reps    Then progress: 27.5kgs. 1st set; 8reps. 2nd set; 6reps....  If you are finding 2 sets of 8 reps too easy with the weights you have been using for the first few weeks, bumb up the weight!!! you should be lifting ~80% of your max.  You could also look at Rippetoe’s (current God of /fit/) Starting Strength as well. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Rippetoe#Starting_Strength_Program Shannon Workout So this is the workout my buddy Shannon taught me, you met him that one time he came over for dinner.  It goes on the philosophy that you destroy yourself for 2 days, have a light-ish 3rd day, then go to Painsville™ for the 4th day.  Then you get a full 3 days off to recover (barely) before it starts again.  I printed it off and took it with me to the gym but now I have it all memorised.  The basic structure is you start off with heavy, hard, compound lifts at the beginning of each session that burns you out, and then you have smaller exercises to just make sure you have totally ripped that muscle and it can repair itself bigger and stronger.  If you don’t want to go home after the first exercise, you are not pushing hard enough.  I have modified it a bit to reduce the total volume of exercises as I think my sessions were too long and compromising my muscle gains by depleting too much energy.  I would check out this yt channel, it is a strength gym so you will never reach these kinds of weights without roids, but the good thing about strength coaches is that they teach perfect technique - http://www.youtube.com/user/EliteFitnessSystems I particularly like the So You Think You Can Bench and So You Think You Can Squat videos.  Pretty much everything is 4sets x 10reps, with 1 minute break between each set.  Warm-up properly.  I generally grab 3kg dumbbells and do some shoulder presses and lateral raise, lateral front raise, get on cable crossover and do single shoulder movements because my shoulder is a constant problem (I haven’t been to the gym between March-Aug because of shoulder damage). WARM UP.  Also, you will want to skip leg day.  Everyone does.  It is by far the most painful and you get DOMS (delayed onset muscle soreness) the worst.  But exercising a muscle as big as the quad releases more testosterone and you get much more natural muscle growth, hence why it is last.",™

t5_2rnve,Azurphax,1355792113,"Quoted from [wisegeek](http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-l3-cache.htm)  ""When a request is made of the system the CPU requires instructions for executing that request. The CPU works many times faster than system RAM, so to cut down on delays, L1 cache has bits of data at the ready that it anticipates will be needed. L1 cache is very small, which allows it to be very fast. If the instructions aren’t present in L1 cache, the CPU checks L2, a slightly larger pool of cache, with a little longer latency. With each cache miss it looks to the next level of cache. L3 cache can be far larger than L1 and L2, and even though it’s also slower, it’s still a lot faster than fetching from RAM.    Assuming the needed instructions are found in L3 cache (a cache hit), bits of data might be evicted from L1 cache to hold the new instructions in case they’re needed again. L3 cache can then remove that line of instructions since it now resides in another cache (referred to as exclusive cache), or it might hang on to a copy (referred to as inclusive cache), depending on the design of the CPU.    For example, in November 2008 AMD® released their quad-core Shanghai chip. Each core has its own L1 and L2 caches, but the cores share a common L3 cache. L3 keeps copies of requested items in case a different core makes a subsequent request.    The architecture for multi-level cache continues to evolve. L1 cache used to be external to the CPU, built into the motherboard, but now both L1 and L2 caches are commonly incorporated into the CPU die. L3 cache has typically been built into the motherboard, but some CPU models are already incorporating L3 cache. The advantage of having on-board cache is that it’s faster, more efficient and less expensive than placing separate cache on the motherboard.    Fetching instructions from cache is faster than calling upon system RAM, and a good cache design greatly improves system performance. Cache design and strategy will be different on various motherboards and CPUs, but **all else being equal, more cache is better**.""    APUs are great, you don't *need* L3 cache necessarily. Just a specialized type, and all else equal more is better, right? Seriously though, like the buildapc bibles say, check dem benches. ..But if you want to get techy...

t5_2qhwp,Beakerbite,1355822445,"Blizzard games are inherently difficult to discuss as they are under constant change.  When talking about Diablo 2, do you always talk about the latest version, the release version, or somewhere in between.  When discussing the balance of SC2, which patch are you talking about?  Which expansion (not yet but Soon™)?  Blizzard games always have more life to them then most games.  The only one I can think of (negating Free to Play and MMOs as I don't play them) is Minecraft.  The developers are still going through massive changes in the game and it gets weekly updates, some bigger than others.  You have that to some extent with games that offer plenty of DLC but DLC costs money (unlike Blizzard/Minecraft patches) and generally stops within a year after release (unlike Blizzard's long term development over the course of years).  A lot of people lost faith with the release D3 and have little interest in coming back to check on it's current status.  The hype and marketing also drew in a crowd of consumers who wouldn't typically enjoy the ARPG model and found the game lacking.  The /r/games end of the year discussion was the most level headed I've seen so far and didn't veer too far down the ""Blitz make money on RMAH, greed ruin game"" drivel.",™

Tom is in love with the idea of Summer and doesn’t really consider who she is at all.  His list of the things he likes doesn’t even include any personality traits.  He says “I love her smile.  I love her hair.  I love her knees.  I love the way she licks her lips before she talks.  I love the heart-shaped birthmark on her neck.  I love it when she sleeps.”  That’s not love, that’s attraction (at best).  Yes, she’s fun and she makes him have fun, but there’s a lot more to a relationship than that.  &gt;Not only is Summer this MPDG, but Tom is presented to the audience as the typical Nice Guy™ (I’ve dealt with a few of these, they really suck).

Between runes/skills/items your third proc of W is a ~30% reduction/29flat armor penetration. * 21/9/0 makes her do Tons of Damage™, but didn't make her tanky enough for me. I liked 9/21/0 since she gets %health based damage and armor reduction. 14/16/0 could work too. * Her attack speed is pretty slow without the bonus AS from W, meaning Q is actually going to be your primary source of applying Denting Blows stacks. These stacks apply to multiple targets, by the way - they're not like Vayne W. * E has a ~600 range, definitely use/abuse this. Charged Q + E clears a wave faster than almost any other melee champ in the game. * I started Q for the escape, I'm not sure why you'd start any other skill unless you're a jungler (start W there) * I skilled her R &gt; Q &gt; E &gt; W, only because I didn't like how E pushed the lane. E's stack recharge is pretty quick even at low levels, so I never really worried about that. I think if I was against a heavy pusher I'd skill E before Q.

Take something that barely resembles minimum wage that you will do for at least 40 hours a week (half of your waking hours). Doesn't matter you can't afford a proper home or a pension. The Economy has no need for you so you should be glad you're allowed a service industry job.  Or if that isn't on the table, move. You can't choose where you'll live. Leave your friends, parents, siblings, memories, comfort zone. The Economy requires that you make this sacrifice.  Not happy with how society works? Vote. No lengthy pseudo-intellectual explanation about how laughable our ""democracy"" is.  Look at all the choices The Economy will grant you. Learn a trade and pay for lessons, course material and basic materials. Write something with your inferior education and your anti-intellectual background. Good luck. (research shows people from poorer backgrounds have significantly stunted vocabularies and overall language capabilities). Go enjoy social activities, but don't forget your Status™ (to be paid for in either actual money or in partaking in X amount of nefarious activities) Proven to work as all successful people you're constantly being bombarded with through TV (aspirational TV, anyone?) and advertisement ALSO use Status™  **Now repeat after me: ""I am free"".**  Either do the oftentimes literally impossible, win the lottery or conform your dreams, aspirations and in effect your life to the whims of The Economy GBUI (Growth Be Upon It).  Human civilization is a testament to the idea that if we are to thrive and shed the yoke of our surroundings dictating our well-being, that we have to intervene in our surroundings.  We've lost that. We bow and we accept, and pray we do not lose our ticket in the lottery which we got in exchange for our sacrifices. We bow and we accept, believing that we, frail individuals, are the alpha and the omega of responsibility in this universe.  Because the alternative requires us to look up.",™

Bugs was a wisecracking prankster with a strong New York accent who was modeled after live action film comedy actors such as Groucho Marx.  One of the hallmarks of the Bugs Bunny character were a series of repeated idiosyncratic malapropisms and mispronunciations, which seemed to be an intentional tribute to the hidebound and unworldly working-class New Yorkers of the era.

As a healer, I'm more than happy to heal a person that informs me they are just new versus someone who blindly charges packs and can't control threat.   As a tank, Line of Sight (LoS) can be your greatest ally. If you look at your HPs and see that you're not the highest in the group, be prepared to take smaller risks in terms of pack pulls. Be situationally aware. A tank that doesn't know that adds are attacking, or isn't watching The Bad Thing On The Ground™ that he's standing in becomes a quick liability. It's on you to control the majority of a fight and placement during a fight is usually crucial. It can determine speed of damage, both out and in. If you can cluster your enemies, then you are also clustering your allies making AoE damage and heals vastly more poignant.   DPS will attack random shit. Be prepared to tab target, or whatever you use to select mobs in a pack. You will be bouncing threat at times, don't flip your lid if that happens. Find the DPS that's doing it and just pay attention to their threat levels. If a pet is growling/taunting, don't stress. Ask for that to be turned off, and if it doesn't just let the pet die if needed. Usually pet classes forget that they were just out questing when their 30 min queue popped and had their pet out to tank for them.   Lastly, be aware of your party resources.

White.  Blacks are only 13% of the population (males only 6%) yet they make up between 15% to 22% of serial killers.

Hickey, a criminal psychology professor at California State University at Fresno, said there have been plenty of minority serial killers. In his 1995 book, ""Serial Murderers and Their Victims,"" Hickey wrote that 22 percent of such killers were black. An additional 17 percent were women.  ""It's a stereotype that . . . most serial killers are white,"" Hickey said. ""You ask most experts and they can't name a black serial killer. We have Asians and we have Hispanics that were serial killers. We need to get away from all the myths.""  With a database of 399 serial killers from 1800 to 1995, Hickey found:  (1) 20% of the killers were black. (2) 17% were women.  Serial Murderers and Their Victims Eric Hickey Wadsworth Publishing 1996  With a database of 800 serial killers from the 20th century, Newton found 16% of cases were African-American  Century of Slaughter 1992 Michael Newton  With a database of 558 offenders operating in the United States since 1900, Fox and Levin found:  (1) 86% of the killers are male. (2) 82% are white. (3) 15% are black. (4) 4% are Hispanic.  Extreme Killing: Understanding Serial and Mass Murder James Alan Fox and Jack Levin Crime and Justice, Vol. 23, 1998 (1998), pp. 407-455 Sage Publications 2005  In a sample of 413 serial killers operating in the United States from 1945 to mid-2004, it was found that 90 were African American. Relative to the African American proportion of the population across that time period, African Americans were overrepresented in the ranks of serial killers by a factor of about 2.

Some of the features have been in game for a while, so -- actually two major things -- server rentals and Skill Trees didn't make into the game yet. This being said we've realized that layout and presentation of this information needs to be changed on the Steam page, which we did today in the morning. After we did it, we still enjoying being [the] Number One top-grossing game on Steam at the moment. So my point is, yes, I'm sure that few players maybe be upset, but I can assure you that based on what we're seeing and number of people who post bad comments are small percentage of people who actually bought [the] game.  **So basically they gave a ""Doesn't matter, got cash"" reply to this. They seem to be exposing themselves as cash-whores really well.**  &gt; Max players -- I'm not sure why this is even an issue. [The] text clearly stated ""up to 100 players."" And 50 players [which] we have right now -- is what our players -- our community feels is comfortable level for them to play. We had it at 40, we've raised it to 70, and after that we've asked our players, ""What you want this number to be for Colorado map?"" Over 90,000 players took [the] survey and most of them said -- 50. This is why this number is set to 50 right now. Yet -- on your own private servers you will be able to set to 100 if you want :). Size of the area, once again, come on -- [the] first map is over 100 sq km :). So [the] text is right. And for our next big map, California, we're testing map size of 420sq km.  **Except private server support isn't possible right now because renting a server is disabled. Plus wasn't the big controversy about the Colorado map the fact that it wasn't even 100 square kilometres? More like 75?**  **This guy seems to be ignoring the problem here, touting game features promised soon.™**  &gt; Okay -- if text is saying ""up to 100 players"" -- yes, I may imagine situation when somebody will say ""okay it HAVE TO BE 100."" ""Over 100 sq km"" falls in ""100 to 400"" right? Okay my point is -- online games are [a] living breathing GAME SERVICE. This is not a boxed product that you buy one time. It's evolving product that will have more and more features and content coming it. This is what The War Z is.  **I wouldn't consider WarZ a remotely decent product with one 75km zone, and the reality of being nickel-and-dimed for weapons that you can lose permanently upon spawning and being instagibbed by players camping the limited spawns.**  &gt; Let's be frank: when you read ""up to 100 players"" -- what does it mean to you personally? I mean, for me it doesn't mean that I will play with 99 other players. Really :) And yes game supports 100 players -- heck, it supports actually over 400 players per server as of today. Do we have servers launched with this number of slots? No we don't, because this is not what our players WANT.  **No you stupid fuck. The released product only supports up to 50 players. TotalBiscuit illustrated this in his review and everyone else clarified this limitation. That is not ""up to 100 players.""**  &gt; What's difference ? I mean -- I'd love to adjust that BTW -- I just personally don't see what difference does it make? Ie -- THIS IS ""THE WAR Z"" game. It's not like there'll be ""final release"" or anything like this.  **Holy shit. These guys don't care at all do they? Minecraft managed to do it really well because they were honest about what they were advertising. An alpha, a beta, and then finally a finished product. What WarZ's developers have offered is basically a barebones mod of War Inc, failing to deliver on any of the features they falsely advertised on their Steam page with zombies riddled with microtransactions.**  &gt; Nope - there's no such thing as ""fully released"" for online game. As far as I'm concerned The War Z is in stage when we're ready to stop call it Beta. This is basic version - bones that we're going to add more and more ""meat"" - features and content in a coming months and hopefully years.  **Is WarZ even finished enough to be called a beta let alone a full standalone game? Minecraft took over a year of development before it could become a beta and it had many features, bug fixes etc added before it became both a beta and a finished product.**  &gt; This is what we call it. There's no such thing as ""Release"" for an online game. More important - you can't just add ""foundation release"" or any other words to the title of the game on Steam.  **[Who the fuck is this, Ocean Marketing's head?](http://penny-arcade.com/resources/just-wow1.html)**",™

This control was given to the free Qt foundation, which can still make this call should Digia do crappy things. Pity Sun didn't do things like that before the Oracle-debacle.

t5_2sdjj,squidgirl,1355977704,"Mmmm... nope. I am an introvert. Always have been. I don't like confrontation. I've found ways around my introversion via my counter-phobic side (used to be very phobic as a teenager and in college). Used to have serious issues with self-esteem and confidence in myself. It's taken me a long time to get to the point that I can debate anyone confidently about anything, and not feel like I'm worthless. These are tendencies that I need to actively work on every day... so I don't become overwhelmed by my anxiety.  For me, less is more. I prefer the traditional Riso/Hudson/Palmer enneagram. I even like what Maitri has to say on the ""spiritual dimension of the enneagram"" because her perspective adds value/depth (despite the spiritual language it is pretty accesible from a more intuitive/feeling direction).   The more I think about it, the more Tritype seems to be reminiscent of MBTI! Enneagram is not just about identifying personality structures... it is about learning your strengths and weaknesses.  We have established here via this discussion that Tritype® is a significantly different system than traditional enneagram (Riso/Hudson/Palmer).   If we continue to allow the discussion of Tritype® in this subreddit... every question from new users will devolve into a debate between the traditional enneagram side and the ""Tritype®"" side. This will limit productive discussions, dilute the purpose of this subreddit and create division between users. This could become very off-putting for new members of this subreddit.  Please don't take this personally, I just want to hear your honest thoughts on this.. Perhaps we could consider a new subreddit just for Tritype discussion...? I'd be willing to help moderate. :)",®

t5_2qh1s,gizram84,1356021639,"&gt; Ok then. They store bullets cartridges by holding on to the groove in the brass casing  But you're still missing the point that magazines don't use the groove in the casing at all, clips do however.  I can't believe you're still arguing this.  You're wrong dude.  There are two terms, clips and magazine.  Each term defines a separate device that has separate functions.  Clips and magazines are not interchangeable in any way.  They are separate products for separate functions.  I don't know why we're still arguing over this.  Thanks for the pictures, I'm well aware of what a clips and a mag look like.  I've used both before, many times.  You said that if you cut the size of a magazine off, it would ""look"" like a clip.  I said you're wrong.  &gt;&gt; Colt’s Match Target® line of rifles is a direct descendant of the original Colt M16 supplied to the U.S. Armed Forces  &gt; They call it an assault rifle because it is a converted assault rifle  Of course it is.  You're completely ignoring my my point entirely.  Yes, it looks the same.  Yes, it fires the same round.  Yes, it's the descendant of the M16.  All of that is true, and I don't dispute that.  However, **you are ignoring the *key* difference!**  The real difference is the ability to burst fire.  This is exactly what the media and government tries to confuse.  A machine gun will continue to fire projectiles while the trigger is depressed until it runs out of ammo.  A standard semi-auto rifle will not!  Calling a semi-auto rifle an ""assault rifle"" is purposely trying to confuse the difference between the two and incite fear.  When tragedies like the Newtown shooting happen with regular semi-auto rifles, the media and government throws pictures around and claims they are ""assault rifles"".  People get confused and think that means machine guns.  I would bet you that if you did a survey in America right now, most would think that a machine gun was used to kill those kids.  This is their goal.  They want to confuse the difference between assault rifles and standard rifles to incite fear and gain more support to erode our rights.",®

So i made a label that stated ""Retard"" with a handicapped symbol on either side of the word.

He said no, but i felt like in many ways, i already dared myself. Next order on the screen was a 10pc Chicken McNuggets. I slapped the sticker on the inside of the box over the ""Nugget"" part so on the inside it said ""10 piece Chicken Mc♿Retard♿"" About an hour later, a lady came in, and she was crying. I asked the cashier what the hell was goin on and he said ""i undo, this bitch is crying and holding a nugget box"" i thought to myself, ""who the fuck waits an hour to eat there nuggets?""

t5_2fwo,bachmeier,1356059710,"&gt; If that happens you'll be able to just fork it  That doesn't help. It would take a few years to be in a position to fork F# and maybe even mono.  &gt; Look we both know why you came to the conclusion you did.  I stated facts in my post. Any rational person would have drawn the same conclusion. The website doesn't work on Linux. From what I've read, not everything (due to F# being designed for .Net) works on Linux. AFAICT, the Linux implementation isn't the same as the Windows implementation.  I've been studying Standard ML using *ML for the Working Programmer*. It's an excellent book and I've really come to like ML for functional programming. I don't see SML being a practical choice for real world projects. OCaml is, to put it nicely, a bit of a mess to learn. That leaves F#. Mono even has P/Invoke for calling C libraries.   What I see when I look at F# is a language designed by Microsoft for use on Windows. Now there's a push to turn it into an open source, community-led project. The problem is that ""Windows lock-in"" and ""the Microsoft way"" are deeply embedded into the F# community. At the bottom of the screen on tryfsharp.org, you see  ""©2012 Microsoft Corporation."" There's a message stating that it won't work on Linux. A month ago, there was a post here titled, ""Community for F# Online Meetup - ""The F# Foundation""."" I clicked on the link, and it was an MSDN blog, with the message, ""To save time before the meeting, check your system to make sure it is ready to use Microsoft Office Live Meeting"" All the resources out there start with an assumption that you're developing on Windows.  This is very different from disliking Microsoft for their past actions. F# is meant for Windows developers, but yeah, they won't try to stop you if you want to use F# on Linux. The state of F# on Linux is the equivalent of std::vector not being available on a Windows implementation of C++.",©

There's a big difference. Total homicides have decreased (and population increased) so the rate per 100,000 population has gone down. What's actually happened as gun crimes in total number has decreased and knife murders stayed steady/decreased less quickly - which means as a percent they seem to have jumped - but that's just because gun laws have meant less gun murders.  *I honestly don’t know how fast your population is growing.  First world countries (with the US bing the notable exception tend to grow slowly.  So going from 300 murders a year to 280 murders a year, over a 10 year period doesn't look all that impressive unless your population doubled.*  You guys should really make people fill out a form and prove that they need a knife. You have to be 18 to buy knives and carrying them around without reason is a criminal offence. e.g. chef on the way to a job carrying knives = ok. Person carrying a hunting knife to a cinema = illegal. Out camping? = ok to carry a pocket knife.  *You are making my point for me if anyone is even reading this far into the posts anymore.  This is were we’d be heading with new gun legislation.*    *The idea strikes me that this all may some elaborately constructed argument to disenfranchise anti-gun people from their own movement.*  You did actually have a school shooting. Which was this? Our last mass-shooting was the Port Arthur massacre which was (and still is) one of the largest body counts in the world. That was in 1996 or 97 I think. We haven't had one since. Not to say it won't happen - but the access to semi-autos is far more restricted (sure, there are off the books ones still - but they're dwindling).  *I have access to functioning grenade launchers if I fill out the right forms.  2002 some university student killed 2 of his class mates with a competition pistol.  Hardly a massacre, but it got media attention so the laws for your entire nation were changed.  And you gov’t went to extraordinary measures remove all offending guns from the population.*    Taking my sister's kids to the shooting range is a right of passage. Hey, my dad taught me to shoot. I wouldn't say it's a rite of passage for most people though. You'd generally find that most people haven't even seen a gun outside the ones police carry.  *I’m talking about Americans, as much as the rest of the world thinks they understand us, we do have a culture that is our own that you can’t learn about from just watching our movies.  Some random island somewhere has a right of passage of picking your first coconut or something.  Guns, sex and cars are ours for males.  And you (collectively) do play our video games and match our violent media… so pretty much all you’ve been brainwashed to believe is that guns are killing machines.  This is interestingly something I’ve dealt with on a few occasions; usually when taking a novice shooting.  I hear how they expect the gun to work or what they expect it’s functionality to be… these mirror what they see in video games.*  The line we are arguing over drawing in the United States is a far cry from what you poor bastards did. You've drawn a line? What with? Invisible ink? :)  *A reinstatement of the 90s Assault Gun Ban has been floating around in the House for years.  That's the line we are fighting over.  Numerous national polls, regular ink ☺*  The anti-gun people will probably be very happy with a Clinton Assault Weapon type ban. It's still rubbish - semi-autos are the problem. Shooting guns is still fun without needing to bang off rapid fire. I realise there's a dopamine kick that comes from rapid fire guns - but shit, it's really not a big deal.  *How do you know?  When you you need a follow up shot for hunting?  How likely is the first round going to be when facing an attacker?  It you only needed one, then your cops would probably be carrying around single shot weapons.  I’m betting they don’t.  It’s not anymore of a rush to an experienced shooter than driving a car.  People who get an increased pulse and breathing rate are not accurate.*  Us gun-nuts think the laws are already too strict; we don't want to give anything 'cause nothing scares us more than turning into... well, Australia. Is that because you think guns are illegal here? Because they're not. Shit, you can also get semi-autos if you really don't mind the paperwork and regularly attending a gun club..  Strangely enough though we have access to guns and a fraction of the death count. You have to secure your guns - but really, that's just basics of gun safety and it should be enforced by law.  *When you have to justify why you have a gun to the authorities, it’s a privilege, not a right.  Seeing as even rimfires require justification in your country, I would say you do not have the right to a firearm.*  Americans move here and think it's an issue, then they see that it's actually no big deal and you don't have the ""what if they've got a gun"" thing sitting in the back of your mind.  *I bet a 90lb woman walking through an alley at night doesn’t feel all that secure.  Her attacker didn’t have his right to be three times her size made illegal.*    *An assault rifle is overkill for someone shooting up kindergarteners.  He could have accomplished the same outcome with a crossbow.  Or a school bus.  I get that people in the cities of Australia decided that people living in rural areas didn’t need to have access to guns.  If you can make your own risk of getting murdered go down by 5%, then hell, why not trample the lifestyle of someone you don’t even know.  We are a Republic; part of that means that majority doesn’t rule… the rights of the few cannot be destroyed by the 51%ers.  Every political battle in the US right now centers around this very concept.  At the end of the day, any new laws will end up in front of the supreme court who doesn’t consider popular opinion.  Only our founding principals (as interpreted from either their own liberal or conservative bias).  Chicago tried to ban guns, the Supreme court said, no.*  *The rest of the western world has decided to legislate themselves to safety.  That’s how the bad guys take over.  That’s not made up or a fantasy.  Basically what your country has done is traded 5% of additional personal safety for 20% higher likelihood of tyranny.  Maybe your likelihood of tyranny is extremely low, because Aussies are so much smarter and better than North Koreans.  Fine by me, that’s your choice to believe that way.  I don’t.*   *I'm glad to hear that for once Americans are being tolerant while living in a backwards culture :)*",☺

t5_mouw,moishew,1356099885,"Incase anyone is looking for the full-text, it hasn't been released yet by Elsevier, and Epub is not ahead of print on pubmed as far as I can tell.  Title: Amygdala activity contributes to the dissociative effect of cannabis on pain perception. Authors: Michael C. Lee, Markus Ploner, Katja Wiech, Ulrike Bingel, Vishvarani Wanigasekera, Jonathan Brooks, David K. Menon, Irene Tracey  (DOI: 10.1016/j.pain.2012.09.017) will appear in PAIN®, Volume 154, Issue 1 (January 2013) published by Elsevier.  Until then I'm not holding my breadth.   And lets not forget that ""activation"" is a very broad term. When a structure becomes active and does not change when looking at the brain in fMRI (with only 12 subjects) which this article is suggesting of other pain related areas, such as those in the PAG and spinothalamic tract, it does not mean that the information conveyed is the same. That is, normal structures involved in the processing of pain can stay active, but these structures now process and transmit different information when THC (or whatever cannabinoid receptor agonist they used) is on board.   I'd like to see the full-text and not a sensationalized media paper, partly because the article linked from the title mentions the anterior-mid cingulate, but the title of the peer-reviewed paper mentions the amygdala.

Presumably they put this in place because people in such careers are more exposed to violence and stuff.  If we think about it though, school and police employees in particular may be using aggressive force towards children/civilians so in many cases, things labelled as assault towards them may be situations of people responding to them overstepping the bounds of their authority.  If a police officer was being overly rough with a civilian who was not resisting arrest (something they may get away with if it can't be proven) someone who steps in to stop that may be slapped with this offense, and I don't like that.

t5_2r9vp,UntamedVillans,1356125020,"Then connect a tube that goes to your mouth so you can play and get high.  I invented a extension, where I plug my ""Sharpie MAGNUM™"" Pipe into a bottle and that bottle has a mask like piece stuck onto that. Connected to the mouth piece is a piece of soda can shaped to my chin, covered in duct tape. Next there are 2 thick elastic bands one wraps around my lower head and the other, the top of my head (that kinda back part, where its a little bald)  Now, Im wearing an angry bird hat, for padding. Now, how do I breathe out? See, the mouth piece covers my mouth only. So I breathe in through my mouth and out my nose.  What I do for a bowl, since im under age is roll up a Coke can piece into a cone (My lighter is on the bud for like 10 seconds max, plus its thicker than Al Foil, so im not doing much, if not any damage)  So I have 4 rolled cones all packed.  I pop one into my gas mask, light, cash, take out and throw it in my Cone Box, where I will empty out ashes (I seem to never finish my Cones, so, I end up putting the ashes (some have a few chunks of bud) in a container, for storage.  Once Im dry, or want to save weed, I remove the lid, pop a penny in and cover the open top with a plastic fly screen mesh. After about a few minutes of a little shaking, the ashes should be out and Ill have about 2 cones worth of stonage (Note: One cone gets me really high)  Its great cause one cone lasts me a full Halo game, so I can switch them and get up for a snack or something, then return and light up during the loading screen.  Next Im working on a stand for it, and a hemp with attachment, so instead of putting down my iPad, Controller, DS or whatever, I just have to release one hand, flick the bottom end up, so the wick goes down and my mask fills with smoke, then flick it down and return.  Another addition is to cut a hole into the mouth piece so that I can incorperate a bendy straw into it, so I can drink too.  Sure its stupid. But its great to do all this and play a game un interrupted.",™

t5_2qht0,petemillersteakho,1356131784,"**Your analysis is full of lies and speculation.**    Lawyer here. I spent a few years doing criminal defense. Let's go through this! Officer said I am searching your car. I said, ""No, I do not consent to any searches."" The smell of marijuana is probable cause for one to be searched; either your body, your car, or your house. He said he smelled weed so he proceeded to search my car. You should have insisted on a warrant. Always insist on a warrant. Do not give in, ever. Make them get a warrant.   **1. This is your first mistake.  If the police ask to search your private property you can say yes, no, or not answer.  In my case I said no.  However since they had probable cause, the smell of trees, it didn’t matter if I consented.  Make them get a warrant?  I was pulled over and I said, “I do not consent to any searches.”  There was nothing more I could do.  Since they already had probable cause, they didn’t need a warrant.  They just searched my car anyway.  You are completely wrong about asking for a warrant. The cops don't care if you ask for a warrant, they will search you anyway.**  After the officer found the marijuanas, I told him to look at my signed and current doctor's recommendation. He found the note, read it, and then arrested me. He didn't verify if it was real. He didn't call his supervisor. He said concentrated cannabis is a felony regardless. None of that matters. They usually have the lab test it anyway. By the way, what you see on TV and in the movies is usually pure bullshit.  **2. They didn’t lab test anything in my case.  You are completely wrong when you say, “they usually have the lab test it.”  It didn’t happen in my case.  You provide no proof, only speculation.**     The next month was pretty intense. In order to save money I decided to represent myself. I am not an attorney. I spoke to 8 different lawyers. I sat down with 4 different lawyers. I tried to get the ACLU to represent me. (They did not). I was told by the public defenders what I should do. You get a free public defender. EVERYONE gets a FREE public defender. What were you thinking? That you have the knowledge and skills to represent yourself? Nope. I don't care how smart you are, if you don't have experience in the legal field, you're a complete and utter fucking idiot. If you were on an airplane, could you pilot it because you ""are smart enough to figure things out""? Nope. You'll kill yourself. Even after law school, it takes 2-3 years to figure out how everything works.  **3. Public defenders are not free.  Mark Carillo, a public defender that works at Burbank courthouse told me so.  He was the one who helped me gather my defense.  You are completely wrong about public defenders being free.  Please provide proof of your claim.  If you don’t believe me please call Burbank courthouse,  and ask for the public defender's office.  They are not free.  You will find that you do not know what you’re talking about and you have lied here.  In fact, a google search will explain that CA public defenders are not free and a post-court hearing in front of a judge will decide how much you pay.  I was able to get free advice from the public defender and not pay their fee.  Care to provide proof that public defenders are free in CA?  You cannot because you lied.**   Don't give us any BS about how public defenders aren't any good. Most are excellent lawyers who work long hours for little pay. Plus they know everyone in the DA's office, which is where the deals are made. Further, PD's don't just plea people out. If you want a trial, you get a trial. If the PD refuses to go to trial, go to the court and request a new PD. Plus the court will kick the PD's ass for refusing to go to trial. The PD works for you and has to fully represent you. Also, the ACLU rarely gets involved in criminal cases. I'm sure they told you to get a PD, right? And you didn't. and the prosecutor dropped all 4 charges. It was a plea deal so in order to get the charges dropped I had to agree to forfeit all seized evidence. No, they did not drop the charges. They dropped the jail time, etc. in exchange for a felony plea bargain! You plead out to a felony. You are a complete and utter dumbfuck.   **4. They dropped all 4 charges.  I did not plead guilty.  Prosecutor said I must agree to forfeit the marijuana in order to have all charges dropped.  I got all 4 charges dropped on my own.  NO COURT FEES, NO JAIL TIME, NO GUILTY PLEA.  ALL 4 CHARGES DROPPED.  DOES IT SOUND LIKE I’M DUMB?**   Seriously. That sounds harsh, because it is. Pleading out to a felony without being represented is like trying to remove your gallbladder by yourself.   **5.  Your gallbladder analogy is absurd.  Self gallbladder surgery can lead to death.  Not really an appropriate analogy when all I had to do was walk into the courthouse with a notarized doctor’s letter and all 4 charges were dropped.**     This is monumental, epic stupidity. I feel sorry for you. But this is what happens when you think you can handle it yourself. I was left with a ridiculous $1000 bill from the bail bondsman, a $300 impound fee for my car, and a felony arrest record which will follow me for the rest of my life. And I feel I've done nothing wrong. You were completely wrong to think you could DIY this. You had a FREE LAWYER who probably would have disposed of this with a few motions. At worst, you could have explained all this to a jury,   **6.  A suspect does not go before a jury unless he pleads not guilty and goes to trial.  Since I never pleaded guilty or went to trial, I never spoke to a jury.  This is the part that makes me think you are not a lawyer.  My case never moved past the arraignment.  It was dropped.  They had no case on me.**     though the DA would have probably dropped it. You are guilty of being stupid. You are also guilty of letting the DA's office manipulate you so they can pimp their conviction rate.    **7. Again, I was not convicted only charged.**   You know they keep track of that, right? They love to get their stats up. So they told you that it would all go away and there will be no jail, etc. if you just sign here. And you did. That was the worst possible thing you could have done. I made a complaint to the Burbank watch commander because I believed it was an illegal stop, illegal search, and illegal arrest. The watch commander cleared the officer of any wrongdoing. The Burbank watch commander even told me, ""I encourage our officers to make these kinds of arrests."" I was speechless. He mentioned that he wouldn't want any kids trying concentrated cannabis. Again, you did the completely wrong thing.   **8.  I believed the officer pulled me over for doing nothing wrong.  It was very important for me to make a complaint with the watch commander.  I did not, “do the completely wrong thing. “**   Filing complaints does not change your conviction or get it thrown out.  **9. True but it can get a bad cop off the street ☺**   Again, you should have used a PD who could have gone over the facts and used them to defend you. Again, it was really stupid to think you could handle it yourself. the only thing I have learned from this whole mess is to *NEVER SPEAK TO THE POLICE. No. The lesson you desperately need to learn is that you shouldn't try to do things you have no experience doing. I recently went to the optometrist. You know why? Because I don't have the skills or training to do it myself. I trust him, as a professional. If your car's engine throws a rod, take it to a mechanic. If you don't feel well, go to a doctor. If you have a legal problem, go to a lawyer. If you don't use a professional when you need one, then you get what you deserve. Though you don't tell us, I'd wager that all eight attorneys, the ACLU and the court encouraged you to use a PD. Right? You were probably told to get a PD a dozen times and you did not.   **10. 2 of the 8 lawyers I spoke to were public defenders who worked at Burbank courthouse.  The public defenders told me what to do to gather my defense.  Nobody needed to ""go through the facts"" as you say because the case never went past arraignment**   Your ego caused you to turn down free legal work and got you a felony conviction   **11.  Again, I was not convicted only charged.**    and you don't seem to have the least bit of awareness of that. Think that over. You might have gotten the whole thing thrown out but for you thinking that you could handle something you had zero training or experience in. Sorry, no sympathy here. You fucked yourself over, even after being repeatedly warned not to.  **12.  Warned?  Do you have any proof of this?**   Finally, I realize that a harsh tone attracts downvotes. I'm hard on the OP because he really did fuck up. If you find yourself in a bad legal situation, get a pro. Otherwise, you'll suffer for it.   **13.  I am smart, hardworking, great at public speaking, and very familiar with criminal courtroom procedure.  Please explain how defending myself hurt me.  I saved myself money, got all 4 charges dropped, learned a lot, and feel proud for defending myself.  Please explain what a public defender would have done for me that I didn't do myself.  I worked with the public defenders by my side taking their advice.  I didn't fuck anything up** ",☺

t5_2sfmf,RabidRaccoon,1356132680,"I think the problem in the US is not enough guns. If some of the teachers and students had been armed at the school one of them would have shot that asshole shooter in the back.   http://news.investors.com/ibd-editorials-on-the-right/122012-637844-mass-killers-deterred-by-gun-owners.htm  &gt; Luckily, some years ago, two famed economists, William Landes at the University of Chicago and John Lott at Yale, conducted a massive study of multiple victim public shootings in America from 1977 to 1995 to see how various legal changes affected their frequency and death toll. &gt; &gt; Landes and Lott examined many of the very policies being proposed right now in response to the Connecticut massacre: waiting periods and background checks for guns, the death penalty and increased penalties for committing a crime with a gun. &gt; &gt; None of these policies had any effect on the frequency of, or carnage from, multiple-victim shootings. (I note that they did not look at reforming our lax mental health laws, presumably because the ACLU is working to keep dangerous nuts on the street in all 50 states.) &gt; &gt; Only one public policy has ever been shown to reduce the death rate from such crimes: concealed-carry laws. &gt; &gt; Their study controlled for age, sex, race, unemployment, retirement, poverty rates, state population, murder arrest rates, violent crime rates, and on and on. The effect of concealed-carry laws in deterring mass public shootings was even greater than the impact of such laws on the murder rate generally. &gt; &gt; Someone planning to commit a single murder in a concealed-carry state only has to weigh the odds of one person being armed. But a criminal planning to commit murder in a public place has to worry that anyone in the entire area might have a gun. &gt; &gt; You will notice that most multiple-victim shootings occur in ""gun free zones"" — even within states that have concealed-carry laws: public schools, churches, Sikh temples, post offices, the movie theater in Colorado where James Holmes committed mass murder, and the Portland, Ore., mall where a nut started gunning down shoppers a few weeks ago. Guns were banned in all these places. Mass killers may be crazy, but they're not stupid. &gt; &gt; If the deterrent effect of concealed-carry laws seems surprising to you, that's because the media hide stories of armed citizens stopping mass shooters. At the Portland shooting, for example, no explanation was given for the amazing fact that the assailant managed to kill only two people in the mall during the busy Christmas season.  Here's the abstract of the paper  http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=161637  &gt; Abstract:       &gt; &gt; Few events obtain the same instant worldwide news coverage as multiple victim public shootings. These crimes allow us to study the alternative methods used to kill a large number of people (e.g., shootings versus bombings), marginal deterrence and the severity of the crime, substitutability of penalties, private versus public methods of deterrence and incapacitation, and whether attacks produce copycats. Yet, economists have not studied this phenomenon. Our results are surprising and dramatic. While arrest or conviction rates and the death penalty reduce normal murder rates, our results find that the only policy factor to influence multiple victim public shootings is the passage of concealed handgun laws. We explain why public shootings are more sensitive than other violent crimes to concealed handguns, why the laws reduce both the number of shootings as well as their severity, and why other penalties like executions have differential deterrent effects depending upon the type of murder.   We don't need no government to protect us. We need concealed carry laws and lightweight firearms people can carry at all times. They could even be disposable like cigarette lighters and around the weight of a cellphone. The details would be left to the private sector. The government's job would be to allow concealed carry as part of Federal Law. Indeed the US Constitution could be amended to clarify that 2nd Amendment means a right to concealed carry as the Founding Fathers could quite possibly have intended, had they been aware of the inciteful paper by Landes and Lott.   The purpose of firearms legislation is to create fear in the mind of potential criminals. Fear of being shot in the back by a pissed off primary school teacher with a Louis Vuitton Microgun 4000 by Heckler and Koch® in her fucking handbag.",®

t5_2sfmf,RabidRaccoon,1356136477,"&gt; This directly addresses the idea that what we need is more armed people everywhere - schools, churches, Little League games, and so on. A police officer with a standard side arm was no match for an untrained teen with a rifle. People with concealed carry permits may be able to arm themselves against other people with concealed weapons. They will not be able to stop a Sandy Hook or Columbine or Aurora style gunman with a rifle and body armor (none at Columbine, yes at the others).  I dunno. If all the primary school teachers blazed away with Louis Vuitton Microgun 4000s by Heckler and Koch® one of them is bound to get lucky with a head or leg shot. Also the 4000 would have H&amp;K ballistics and hyper velocity lightweight projectiles that would go through body armour, unlike other Personal Protection Appliances.   Another option would be a explosively formed penetrator weapon.   E.g. look at this  http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=AKdFCsycYm8#t=2m55s  Look at the range the jet from the EFP can fire through air. It looks like you can make a scaled down version which fired a jet or superfluid copper that would penetrate body armour from a distance of ten feet or so.

t5_2ut2g,Toby-one,1356151227,"The first person I honestly loved was my best friend but I still don't like the friend zone myth. Because the friend zone is something that some people (mostly men but women are also ""Friend zoned"") construct as a coping mechanism for when someone you really love turns out to not be that interested in you. Because unrequinted love hurts a lot and it hurts doubly when it is someone you are already good friends with.  And also a lot of women pass this myth on because they think it will be easier to be rejected because of friendship, rather than just being honest and saying ""I find you totally boring stop trying to ruin our friendship!"" That is the most disturbing thing about this myth. I can deal with the male creeps who go ""Oh man she friendszoned you"" I can just ignore them but the girls who actually believe that it is somehow inapropriate to date a friend, or who think that they let you down easy with the ""Friend zone™"", or the girls who simply say ""Oh man you got friend zoned"" they are worse because they should know better!  Anyway. It's to early in the mornign to rant about lost love but I'll just say this: Not all men are bastards who just want sex from women, and not all ""friend zoned™"" people are men. There is a related ""zone"" that is called the ""Sex zone"" where someone thinks you are hot and sexy but don't like you on any deeper level and then you just get a superficial relationship that is not emotionally satisfying. And in both instances there are going to be some who suffer from unrequinted feelings and there are going to be some who are fine with the status quo because not everything is about sex and/or love. I find that this whole ""Friend zone"" business cheapens something that is inherently beautiful and I have always refused to stoop to that level even though I have both male and female friends who go ""Oh man she friend zoned you. Bummer!""  ps I have to stop redditing when I can't sleep but I hope it contributed something at least.",™

t5_2rxrw,DarkSideOTheMoon,1356234279,"&gt;Putting that aside, how would you feel dating a man who feels nothing?    It depends on the man. The only man I have ever encountered, let alone heard of, who feels nothing ~ is you.  So, I will address this to you personally, because I do believe and feel that there is ***something*_inside**.  I would be happy to date you because I find you fascinating. So, I would go out on a date or several, to get to know this new type of creature I have met and learn more, gulp to satisfy my curiosity. Try to understand... *connect* Maybe we would become ""friends""... maybe remain loosely in touch... *shrugs* It would depend on what you and I gleaned as we got to know each other and inter-related; engaged in mutually satisfying time together, etc.   I notice you use the word ""feel"" various times. I have the impression that it is like explaining colour to a person who only sees black and white; or dimensions to one who only sees two planes. How can I truly communicate feeling to you, something you are totally unfamiliar with, using only words?? I wish I could clasp your forearm gently, look deep into your eyes as I speak... so you hear me, see me, my body language, feel my warmth, my breath, the vibration of my voice and being... .  Oh, how I would try... it brings tears to my eyes as I write this... just *feeling* how I would try to *connect* with you, find that other frequency, some chink in the chain-mail... It is so important to me to (be able to) receive feedback from the other person. Over time, I would adapt, but initially at least I would require a lot of input / data from you explaining things... um... would you *feel* bored or irritated by a bombardment of questions?? I could tone it down, but if I got no other feedback from you... well, I can barely believe this is possible.   So... these are words... (*what do they mean to you?*)   I would feel... disconcerted. I would feel, I would *feel* ...desperately perhaps try to feel *you* / from you. Then I would adapt...  I would look at you as a real live ""Data"" who is physically human but has no desire to feel so (whereas curiously the Star Trek android did).  I cannot accurately imagine how things might progress further unless I met you / a man like you face to face.   What I can say is that I am happy being single and choose to live alone. I am open to a relationship but I choose not to co-habit, though I am happy to spend some time at each other's homes. Among other things, an ability (for my partner) to be able *feel* at a number of levels (and the more acutely / finely the better) is very important to me. Consequently, I would not pursue a romantic relationship with you.    However, in the hypothetical scenario that I had to live with someone, I would choose you or a person like you over their opposite, even if the latter were in a far milder form. Meaning; people who are drama addicts, negative, energy absorbing, etc. are very damaging to me. Even smaller traits and nuances can be toxic to me over time, let alone deeper ones. Dealing with other people's emotional fields and energy is something that can be draining, time consuming and ~ quite frankly, if you are totally ""neutral"" and can possibly be geared into at least verbalising things positively... then that is preferable to someone with (great) feeling but (emotive) dissonance.    &gt;If not dating, how would you feel in general?   I would consider friendship... I would really have to get to know you, but I don't consider your lack of emotion a ""handicap"" to being a friend; it depends on other factors.   Some questions for you, as and when you'd like to reply:   * Do you have a sense of loyalty and if so, on what is it based?  * Does anything ""bother"" you?  * Do you have preferred chores around the home?  * Have any of your pupils ever incited a trace of emotion or feeling within you?  * Do you seemingly have more ""patience"" with children, i.e. you do not get to *feel* impatient / annoyed?  * How do animals respond to you / you to them?  * Do you have good / bad days?  * Tell me something about your dreams...   Have you got any questions for me?  I can continue on how I feel about you in general but I would prefer some feedback from you, on how I am communicating with you&gt; I need to try and tune in... Please help me as best you can : )  . * ❤ * ",❤

t5_2qzzs,hashimoto222,1356278942,"10 years ago I had the same diagnosis, at the same time I was initially diagnosed with Hashimoto's, i was also diagnosed with Vitiligo (Micheal Jackson type skin whitening), and Jaundice (Gilbert Syndrome-unknown liver dysfunction). I also suffered from frequent migraines.   The Dr's were concerned that I had some larger global autoimmune disorder, and my Endocrinologist, and nutritionist, recommended I adopt a gluten free, high immune support type diet. I initially used Metagenics UltraInflamX®, and Ultra Clear Plus with some vitamin supplements (fish oils, migraine stuff, etc...), and followed Metagenics diet recommendations for the first 6-9 months. My life was slowly transformed. For 2 years my Dr's kept telling my they thought my thyroid would fail within six months, and I would need Synthetic Thyroid, but it never failed. It eventually fully recovered, and for 7 years my bloodwork has shown no more degraded thyroid function, and my migraine headaches greatly decreased from 5-10/month to less then 1/month. My liver function also greatly improved, I no longer have yellow eyes and skin (I radicially altered my migraine regime-much less drugs), and the skin whitening never extended beyond my armpits and groin. I also went from 230, pounds back down to 170 pounds once off Gluten, and my migraine medications.   I would recommend investigating and pursuing a completely gluten free lifestyle. Autoimmune disorders (not just Celiacs) can be caused by wheat gluten. Since that time I am entirely gluten free and mostly eat paleo, and no longer use the supplements, but they were a great way to start the path to being completely gluten free, and ultimately low-carb/paleo. Eventually I was diagnosed with diabetes as well, and since then I have been gluten free and low carb/paleo, the diabetes was greatly helped by a low carb/paleo diet, I spent 9 months on various diabetes medications, but since going low carb my diabetes is completely under control using diet only. Sadly a traumatic brain injury has undone the positive effects on my migraines and I now suffer chronic migraines.   Being gluten Free, and paleo  go hand in hand, and have made and kept me much healthier and free of further complications from my 3 autoimmune disorders Hashimoto's, Vitiligo, and Diabete's. My liver function has also been greatly improved and currently shows no ill effects from my Gilbert syndrome.  ",®

t5_2qhwp,Nienordir,1356287090,"I *hate* it..with a *burning rage* of frustration..and come to the conclusion, that the game is broken by design and a huge waste of time, because you can spend hours on reloading in order to go from complete annihilation to a *'fair'* result with acceptable losses. It's complete BS, because my tactical approach doesn't change, but unless the stars align, you can get screwed over so hard, that it isn't even funny, actually it isn't even *fun to play..*    I'm currently in the late game, most of my veteran troops have died and only my badass sniper with like 170 kills saves the day. The majority of replacements simply die to random BS _or_ because they don't have enough perks&amp;aim to survive just 1-2 turns of sectopods or a group of elite mutons.    I think that's my biggest complaint about the game, because in the old games it didn't matter if half your squad dies, you simply replace them and through tactics and decent gear, even rookies will do okay. Not so Enemy Unknown, if high ranked squad members die, the difficulty skyrockets, advanced gear doesn't matter because the noobs can't hit shit, made worse by the RNG *and* the fact that those heavy enemies have a built in to-hit-penalty (because ♥♥♥♥ you).    As a example one of my last missions..a water map with nothing but shitty cover against *two* sectopods (which ALWAYS spawned right next to each other), at least 6 red elite mutons, a couple green mutons and a ethereal (of which the majority wouldn't leave their small UFO). How are you even supposed to have a *chance* without max lvl soldiers or getting lucky with spawns, so you can reliably snipe them.    It's one thing thing to make aliens overpowered in the early game, it's BS if they remain OP even with the best gear and easily kill of 2-3 members in one turn, what's even worse is..you're **supposed** to flank them, but if you accidentally add another group while trying to do that..its game over..so you can stick to shitty cover and *hope* that your guys don't get screwed by the RNG or *hope* that your sniper has a shot..    Worst part is, in order to start the final mission I have to grind at least one PSI-soldier, but how am I supposed to do that when my guys still die like flies and it's simply to risky to try funky PSI-stuff in all these missions that only spawn heavy elite enemies anymore..    It's just a joke and I think I should just uninstall this unbalanced piece of crap and go back to *real* tactical turn based games, that are fair and revolve around strategy..Enemy Unknown is fun for like 30 minutes, until you reach another of those impossible missions..a game shouldn't be THAT unbalanced, it shouldn't be harder or even MORE random, than terror from the deep (which I actually liked a lot), but they managed to achieve both and these massive design flaws simply ruin any fun, that you could have with the game..    I appreciate that they tried to bring the genre and xcom back, but I can't get over the fact that they haven't even released ONE patch to fix some of the bugs and severe balance issues..",♥

t5_2qi4s,bipolar_sky_fairy,1356370275,"The author has some good points.    1) Make it a ""used universe"" again, per Lucas's own original take on Star Wars. Dents, dings, scratches, scuffs, dirt, blast points, little personal touches. Make it look FUNCTIONAL, not shiny and pretty. People live in this universe.. there isn't someone following behind with a spray bottle of Windex and Speeder Shine®.    2) Yes, you need to have some comic relief in the film.. in the original Star Wars, that's what 3PO and R2 were for, and they did it through their interactions and their observations of the humans they travelled with. They didn't engage in slapstick, or lame puns... they did it by reacting to the situations they found themselves in in their own unique way.  Do not create poop/fart/burp joke characters, or cartoon rabbits or whatever else.  Humor doesn't need to be childish, just funny and accessible to a number of ages.    3) Epic battles mean NOTHING without emotional resonance. Unless we care about the characters, placing them in danger will have zero effect.  Build them up, write them well, and make the stakes high. Make them lose every so often so they (and by extension us) know they CAN. That makes the ultimate victory (or loss) payoff feel real.    4) Don't make a movie for children. Just don't. Make a movie that appeals to adults.. but that *children can also enjoy*. Don't talk down to them. Talk UP to them. Let them experience adults in adult situations running adult risks that will force them to think about what's going on just a little bit to understand it. Creating great adult characters means the kids will want to BE them. No kid wanted to be Anakin when he was 8 years old on Tatooine in The Phantom Menace, nor did they want to be Jar Jar. Nobody. They wanted to be Luke Skywalker, or Han, or Princess Leia or Obi Wan, or any of the adults (even if poorly written).  Do that, and you'll have reclaimed the legacy of Star Wars.   ",®

t5_2qr7i,cjt09,1356406971,"&gt;Fox News isn't a fair comparison because it doesn't just present examples without commentary.  I don't understand what you're trying to say. The website linked in the OP does provide some commentary. The point I was getting at is that Fox News tends to promote a particular viewpoint by showing selective strands of evidence, often out of context, which creates a misleading picture.  &gt; I have no problem with people being called out for hypocrisy (I don't like that they're identified though).  It's probably worthwhile to note that a lot of the posts on that blog don't even display any sort of overt hypocrisy. For example, someone who doesn't believe in same-sex marriage isn't automatically a Nice Guy™. Also I don't understand why so many of the posts involve leg-shaving--this is a dating site and the guys may only be looking for women with shaved legs. That doesn't really make them a Nice Guy™, although the blog implies that they're not *really* nice.  In general I don't think that most of the guys pictured on the blog are really coming from the perspective of hatred. Frustration, naivety, and ignorance maybe, but not hatred. It seems wrong to me to shove a bunch of hate back at them.  &gt; I think that there's more of a chance of people generalizing a relatively small group that many people don't have much contact with (feminists) than a very large group that just about all people have a lot of contact with (men)  The blog isn't generalizing all men, it's generalizing a specific subset of men. It's implying that men on OKCupid who claim that they're nice/sweet/frustrated are in actuality going to be shallow and mean, which isn't true--there are a lot of nice guys who claim to be nice and are actually nice.",™

t5_2qr7i,tygertyger,1356408244,"And Fox News also informs its viewers that those examples *are* representative- that's my point. I understand what you were trying to show, but I disagree.  &gt;It's probably worthwhile to note that a lot of the posts on that blog don't even display any sort of overt hypocrisy. For example, someone who doesn't believe in same-sex marriage isn't automatically a Nice Guy™.  I guess you're referring to the second page, which had quite a few men who are against marriage equality. Many had numerous red flags but ignoring that for a moment- It seems you disagree, but if you don't believe that others deserve the same rights as you, you're not a nice person. Some I think fall more under extreme self-pitying than hypocrisy, but from what I've seen of it, hypocrisy is the focus.  &gt;It's implying that men on OKCupid who claim that they're nice/sweet/frustrated are in actuality going to be shallow and mean, which isn't true--there are a lot of nice guys who claim to be nice and are actually nice.  Ok, I'm starting to see your point. However, the images are not ""I'm nice"" juxtaposed with misogynistic statements. The images largely include self-pitying statements about the friendzone, chivalry, and how it's all girls' faults that they can't get a date. And you know what? You can ask women here- those statements *are* often taken as a warning sign. On many of those, the ""nice"" statements are already huge red flags. Your claim that the blog targets men who just describe themselves as nice doesn't stand up to what it actually is.",™

t5_2r2sg,softwaredev,1356416310,"I have taken several control classes and read three different introductory control texts.     I will list them here with a rating and write a short review for each.    [*Modern Control Systems*](http://www.amazon.ca/Modern-Control-Systems-12th-Edition/dp/0136024580/ref=dp_ob_title_bk/192-5179315-9201266) - **Rating: 2/5**    This is my least favorite control book from all three, in fact this book is the reason why I sought other books. The reason why I do not like this book is because there's too much talking but not a lot of problems throughout the chapters, until you get to the end of the chapter by which time you might have already forgot the methods you need to apply to solve problems. Also I just don't think that the author explains concepts in a way that you (or at least I) could remember while solving problems. One good thing that this book has, but so do other books I have seen, are MATLAB examples. However, these MATLAB examples solve very simple problems, or only parts of the problems when compared to the rest of the problems in the book.    [*Control Systems Engineering*](http://www.amazon.com/Control-Systems-Engineering-Norman-Nise/dp/0470547561/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1356414312&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=control+systems) - **Rating: 5/5**    This book does a very good job at explaining concepts and has example problems throughout the chapters that build up as you progress through the chapter, so that you can see how one thing leads to another. It is also full of MATLAB examples. The book also focuses more on electrical engineering, for example it shows you how controllers are built electronically not just mathematically. My favorite thing about this book is that it gives you the steps, one by one, that you should take for example when plotting a root locus.    [*Modern Control Engineering (5th Edition)*](http://www.amazon.com/Modern-Control-Engineering-5th-Edition/dp/0136156738/ref=sr_1_10?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1356414312&amp;sr=8-10&amp;keywords=control+systems) **Rating: 5/5**     This is my favorite book out of three simply because the author explains concepts very clearly and in a way that cover all possible cases. The only downside, if you can call it that, is that it focuses on both electrical and mechanical engineering and in fact you can skip several chapters if your class is not mechanical focused.     Also, regardless of which book you buy, you should consider buying [*MATLAB for Control Engineers*](http://www.amazon.com/MATLAB-Control-Engineers-Katsuhiko-Ogata/dp/0136150772/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1356415720&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=matlab+for+control+engineers). You are probably going to write a lot of MATLAB code and this book is all code examples focused on control systems. This book was written by the same author of *Modern Control Engineering* by the way.    Lastly, although *Modern Control Engineering* is my favorite book, I would buy *Control Systems Engineering* simply because like I said the former has too much mechanical engineering content and you might not know what you can skip or not.    Edit: I forgot to mention this resource.  [MATLAB's Control System Toolbox™ Getting Started Guide](http://www.mathworks.com/help/pdf_doc/control/get_start.pdf)    ",™

t5_2sokd,susuhead,1356467124,"Indian here.  For the past decade or so, rape has been a constant fixture of the criminal landscape. Urban centres like Delhi, Mumbai and so on are just as affected as the rural areas. Our society has almost always dismissed these as the fault of the victim - blaming them for dressing provocatively, being out late at night, being in the company of young horny men and so on. A generally cunty cop-out, but one that society at large accepted for the many years that rapes went on unchecked. Surely it must be the fault of a lascivious young woman and not the WholesomeIndianMale™.  In keeping with the general attitudes of civil society, cops act pretty shitty toward rape victims too. The reason rape is the #1 most under-reported crime in this country is because cops are *assholes*. They mock victims when compaints are being filed, insinuate that they are loose, *easy* women and frequently fail to follow up properly on rape cases (check out this [particularly egregious situation](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2005/sep/16/india.gender) - this is the norm for police conduct, not the exception).  However, a few days ago, a girl got gang-raped, and had her insides all but scooped out with iron rods in New Delhi, our capital city. Unusually, she was accompanied by a male friend, at a fairly conservative hour, and was on a ""sort of"" public transport bus when it happened. This renders all previous cop-outs invalid - how could it be her fault?  Confronted with the harsh reality that they were barely separated from animals, delhiites went properly apeshit.  The powers-that-be have all been trying to pass the buck, but people are no longer interested in being taken for a ride and are not withdrawing just because so-and-so issued some wishy-washy statement of sympathy. For a nation of generally passive, cowardly fucks, this is unusual.  My personal take? I've lived here for years, I know how this crap works. The ruling classes will apologize, sympathize and generally grovel for as long as it takes for the outrage to die down. Then things will go back to normal and this city of ca. 15 million will go back to life as usual.  Someone needs to die for anything concrete to happen. Now, I know this is a rather dire statement, so bear with me. If the Mob™ grabs the police commissioner or the governor, or chief minister of Delhi and lynches the bastard, the rest of the ruling classes will suddenly sit up in bed and think ""Bloody hell, I could be next."" Suddenly, their lives provide the incentive to give the citizenry the justice they want and the safety they deserve. Suddenly the VIPs stop sucking up the city's police force for their personal security and give the city its due, because for the first time in their miserable existence, they are being held physically accountable.  But of course, this will never happen. I said it earlier - we are a nation of cowards. There is no will to carry this forward into an ""Arab Spring"" for the subcontinent. This will die down, like the hundreds of corruption, misgovernance and crime scnadals in the past. Indians deserve India and vice-versa.  EDIT1: To the folks asking for a proper ELI5 or TLDR, I'm awfully sorry, I have no idea how to shorten or simplify this.  EDIT2: My highest-rated comment on Reddit! At least it happened here and not in a pun thread.  EDIT3: To those accusing me of inciting violence - I am not calling for bloodshed, nor do I condone it.  I am merely making an observation - peaceful protests have accomplished very little on a national scale in our nation's 60-odd year history. This indicates, to *me*, that if there is a clear and present *physical* danger to members of the legislature or security forces from the public, they will be more likely to act than if there were no consequences for their inaction, as has been the case so far.  The same thing could be accomplished by, say, performance-based reviews. You perform, you keep your job, you don't, you get fired. However, the legislature is *never* going to pass a law establishing such a procedure, which brings us back to square one: zero accountability.",™

t5_2s7tt,horrorfetish,1356477121,"As someone who deals with depression and anxiety on a daily basis, and has been on and off medication for quite a few years, you have all my love and support. People get really angry at people when they hear about an attempted suicide, (and I do as well, when they endanger or involve others in their attempt, ie death by police) but most people haven't been there. Most people don't understand that you aren't in the right state of mind and when you make that decision it's not because you're a coward or an asshole, it's because you don't feel any self worth, or that your life is never going to get better.  Logically we know it is, and when we stop to think we know there are lots of people that love us but we don't always feel that way in depression.   One of my good online friends spent a long time after his coming out as transgendered being depressed. He was one of the most generous and kind and loving people I had ever known, and yet all he ever thought of himself was that he was a burden on people, and that he had no right to be alive. He attempted suicide many times, wanting to relieve his sister and his mother of the the supposed burden. He was so grateful for his loving friends and family, but at the same time felt he was nigh-on abusing them because of simply existing. He wasn't selfish, and he wasn't a coward. He truly did not believe he had any worth.  Several months ago (going on a year now...) he disappeared. I think about him every day - his online personas, his website, his galleries are all gone. All I have left are a few drawings he did for me, and one he mailed to me, which I keep close to my heart. I was only ever angry at him once, and I felt like throwing that drawing out to spite him for being gone, for maybe even killing himself. But then I remembered he didn't do it to hurt us, he did it because he was hurting, that he was afraid, and he believed he wasn't worth shit.  But he was worth so much to so many people. The only people who know what happened to him are his sister and mother and father. I hope, every day that he went and sought help, and happened to leave the internet as a form of therapy, and not...well, went through with it. Eirik, if you're out there, we all still love you, and we hope you're well, and we will never forget our wonderful, talented friend.  Oops, and now I'm crying... and that turned into a lot of catharsis. So uh, thankyou op, for allowing me to get that off my chest. If you ever need the same of someone else, especially someone who's been there, I don't know you, and I'm a stranger, but I'm willing to listen. Sometimes that's all you need... not someone who'll tell you you shouldn't do it or that you're worth so much- just someone who you can get it all out to. That's what helped me.  ♥",♥

t5_2qh0n,engimo,1356480692,"Well, if you are willing to start talking about ring/field theory (as opposed to group theory), linear algebra is just a special case of that.   More specifically: a vector space V is a k-module (for k a field), and if we have a linear transformation A: V -&gt; V (which is what linear algebra is mostly about), this endows V with the structure of a k[t]-module, where t acts by applying A to vectors in v.   It Turns Out™ that k[t] is a [PID](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_ideal_domain), as k is a field, and so V becomes a module over a PID. Ring theory has [something to say about this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_theorem_for_finitely_generated_modules_over_a_principal_ideal_domain), and that theorem precisely gives you all of the canonical forms of A that you usually study. This approach gives you a pretty nice conceptual understanding of a lot of things that seem kind of ad hoc in a first linear algebra class.  Edit: There are also various algebraic-type uniqueness theorems about the determinant and trace that, if you think about them hard enough, give you some other ways of understanding them. This is nice. ",™

He was an air force pilot, and the planes were bought cheap from the russians by a corrupt politician (which is one of the student's father)  5) the students struggle, then decide to do something.

t5_2r9tk,Hiskitten,1356488683,"Hi there! i'm submissive, and can help out.  First and foremost: *there is nothing wrong with you*. If you can process that statement above everything else, you'll be fine. ☺  For me, it's more than just the physical (i'm talking about pain - degradation isn't my thing personally - more in a bit). To me, it's *submitting* to it. i came to enjoy physical pain because associated with it is the idea that i am subjected to whatever He wants me to take. After the first experience of being spanked, i began to crave the pain; it represented, for me, the ways in which i could demonstrate my total surrender to Him. And then, as i began to crave more of it (both in frequency and degree), i began to experience the release of endorphins that had me in another state of mind. At the beginning, i was self-conscious, processing too much in a cerebral way (""how should i be reacting? Should i cry? Why am i not crying?"") and it took away from the experience. But then, as He went deeper into the physical pain with me, i let go. i began to absorb the physical sensations and move *with* them, not trying to intellectualize or analyze too much. And tears came when i was relaxed enough to cry (that may not make sense now but it will as you venture further).  As for degradation...i don't like that, personally, but i do enjoy sensual humiliation. That, in essence, is the stripping away of my defenses so i am laid bare to Him in every metaphysical way. Some of the things i've experienced were statements, such as after a spanking, an intense one, He'd drawl, ""I think she LIKES have her ass reddened over My knee,"" or ""What would your friends say if they knew you were just whimpering and moaning as I spanked your bare ass?"" He'd play with my self-awareness and that would deepen my self-awareness as a submissive.  He would have me sit with my skirt raised and my behind bare when we'd go out (in the car, in a restaurant) but always discreetly (He wasn't into publicly embarrassing me). Then He'd draw my attention to it, and make me blush furiously.   Why did i enjoy that? Because once again, it made me feel so utterly subjected to anything and everything i had signed on to experience at His hand.   Giving up control is a really hard thing to do if you're not used to it; but if handled sensitively, built up (the way it was with me) and then enhanced and increased, it turns into an extremely sensual and extremely exhilarating experience.  There is an intimacy in submitting one's body and mind to Another for His/Her pleasure. And when there is trust, that intimacy is enabled. Without trust, that won't happen.  So maybe all of this is to say that for me, personally, it is the fact that my trust was put into the hands of Another and whatever He did to my body, with my mind, made me that much more *His*.  There are those who are just into pain, not submission. You might want to ask about that, it might be what you're looking for.  But as a submissive in my heart, it boils down to trust, intimacy, and the excitement of never knowing what He would do next, with my body or my mind.   One experience to relate: we were at a tourist attraction, filled with families. He went to the water fountain to drink. One of the things He'd instilled in me was the fact that i had to ask His permission to drink. So when He bent over the fountain, i got sassy and said, ""Yes, You may drink."" He didn't even touch the water. He got That Look in His eyes and stood up again. He went to a bench and sat down on it, motioning for me to follow. He took the position He'd always take when He was going to put me over His knee. my heart stopped but i followed Him. He took my wrist...and sat me on His lap instead. He looked me right in the eyes and said, ""Sassing Me? I'll deal with you later.""   That moment...not knowing if He was really going to smack my ass, that had me frozen and excited all at the same time. Because i could trust Him and i knew that whatever He did, He wouldn't publicly embarass me. But...did i *really* know? That experience increased my vulnerability and i loved it. To this day, even though we aren't together anymore, i still love it. Because i felt more submissive than ever before.  i hope this long-winded reply helps you...i'm around if you need more clarification.   You're not alone. This community came through for me when my Master dumped me in the summertime. And though i felt alone, i had people to turn to and it helped my initial shock to at least talk about it. ☺",☺

But I'll continue.  __________This doesn't appear to have anything to do with YOU, it seems to be between your BF and his parents____________  &gt;-When they disapproved of one of his last gfs.....he .....started acting the same way he is acting with me... implying that he does this when he ""has something to hide.""  &gt;My SO has already told me that.... While they have supported him plenty, they have also pulled this shit too many times.   &gt; ....when he tries to communicate things with them, they just pretend they can't hear, and somehow turn it around on him.   Really, THIS is what stood out for me from the rest of your post. Your BF and his parents have some baggage, to put it mildly. It's great that you two have a good relationship, but their relationship is not so good and evidently hasn't been for awhile.  THEY have a problem (your BF and his parents) with their relationship and his parents' response to it, seems to be to blame you for it (and him).   &gt; I have tried speaking on my own behalf......They do not accept ANYTHING I say. Talking to them has proven fruitless.  ***Technically, it's not about you.*** Accepting their garbage as coming from a rational place, is a MISTAKE. What they've said is not really about you. That's why speaking rationally to them won't help. They don't see YOU. They see a person they've fabricated in their minds..... a construct that only exists so that they think there is something they can do to improve their relationship with their son...... *something other than examining their own behavior*.  Know that you can't deal with people rationally when they're coming at you like this. Even if you have a rational argument, they're so bent on living in denial about the consequences of their behavior towards their son, that they're going to ignore anything you can bring up which might prove them wrong. They are skilled at performing the mental gymnastics necessary to keep certain illusions together in their own minds.  I almost broke down all the little things they said that are utter garbage, but honestly, you've already done a great job of doing that. You just need to REMIND YOURSELF of what you're written here. I'd recommend that you do so CONSTANTLY because the mind-job his parents is putting on you is wreaking massive havoc on you. You shouldn't let it. But I guess there is a reason you're letting it get to you......  ___________Conclusion, TL;DR, etc._______________  &gt; So thats it. I can either choose to keep trying with these people.... or I can tell him that I'm OK with him cutting them off completely (something he is more than happy to do). But I feel like those are both losing situations.   &gt; Is breaking up a terribly selfish thing to do when my actual relationship with my SO is good? I love him and care for him very much.   &gt; .....I cannot ask him to stop speaking to his family, but at the same time, I cannot deal with them anymore.   &gt; I'm so tired reddit. I don't know how to be supportive and sane anymore and I'm extremely wary of telling my SO that it is time to cut them off. I'm afraid that is a drastic step, one which cannot easily be undone. And because he also has a little sister, its not just cutting off from his parents, but his sister too, and that is harder.  I think a new way of looking at this would serve you better than the way you're looking at it now.  You can't deal rationally with these people. They have issues with their children and you don't exist to them except as some Excuse for why they don't have a good relationship with their son.   It doesn't sound so much as if it's even your choice whether or not he speaks to his family? It sounds like you're the one who's holding on trying to salvage something good out of this? Am I reading that right? I'd recommend that he seeks out therapy, personally. (If he could drag his parents there too, all the better, but they probably wouldn't go.) But overall, it's HIS choice. Not yours. So I don't quite get why you're putting yourself through so much pain over whether or not you tell him you're okay with his decision. He sounds like he's kind of made it? Just support him.   If they won't work things out in a constructive way and won't go to therapy....... then cutting them off remains the only healthy thing to do. Of course it's not black and white. I'm sure they've done good things but at this point, he's grown up and the negative things are holding his life back. (And your relationship.)  Breaking up with him.....doesn't make sense. Unless you have another reason for doing so that you haven't outlined.   **TL;DR: You can't talk rationally to his parents. Don't bother. They're not even treating you as a real person. They're seeing you as an excuse for why they don't have a good relationship with their son, instead of taking a hard look at their own responsibilities/actions/etc. I'd recommend cutting off contact with them, but really, it's mainly his choice..... you can support him, though. (Assuming that they won't/can't all go to therapy or otherwise try to mend fences constructively.)**",®

I won't give into pressure to conform to outdated standards of style and dress in the name of maturity.

t5_mouw,highguy420,1356537823,"It is also what makes [your urine test at five times the safe drinking water levels for glyphosate \(Round-Up®\)](http://www.ithaka-journal.net/herbizide-im-urin?lang=en) from eating those same chemicals.  I've never heard unsafe levels of compost ending up in our foods.  I'm not against chemicals, but let's test them thoroughly to ensure they are not dangerous to humans.  It's taken us more than 40 years to determine that glyphosate herbicides can cause reproductive harm and users should employ respiratory filtration when applying it (among other risks vehemently attacked by the producers of the chemical).  The problem is that our risk assessment is based on lethal toxicity, which is far too simple a metric by which to determine if a substance is safe for contact or consumption by a human.    We have discovered so many chemical compounds so quickly that we haven't had enough time to find out that lead is a terrible substance to build our water pipes out of.  It is a human condition to assume something is safe until your entire village dies of cancer because that pretty dust you found is actually radioactive.  I could go on, there are countless examples of the phenomenon.  We have not overcome that aspect of our human mentality, and should implement practices intended to protect us from our own overly trusting nature.  I use chemicals every day.  Some of them are man-made, but most are natural.  For example I have an aquaponic garden in which I allow bacteria to convert ammonia-based fish waste into nitrites, and then nitrates that the plants can consume.  I use hydroxylic acid under pressure to treat aphids and hydrogen peroxide to treat mold.  When my plants need it I add other compounds to the nutrient solution including chelated iron or boron.    Chemicals are great, but let's use them as necessary, and as we determine they are safe.  For example many broad-leafed plants can be killed by the application of chelated iron to the soil in higher than normal concentrations, therefore I find it absurd to continue to use a strong chemical like glyphosate which requires significant rehabilitation of the soil to restore normal biological function necessary to sustain healthy life of plants (studies have shown increased propensity towards diseases in subsequent plantings after application of glyphosate herbicides) when a safe chemical compound such as chelated iron can be used in its place.    Chemicals are like the cheat-codes of nature.  Sure, they cut right to the chase and brute-force whatever you want, but the resulting side-effects are often much worse than the problem we were solving.  Allowing worms and bacteria to generate compost may not be as simple as synthesizing or isolating a chemical compound and then spraying it in great quantities on your plants to get them to grow, but there are nearly no health-related side-effects associated with using composted biological matter as a fertilizer.  Phosphate-based fertilizers often contain lead 210 and pulonium 210, both are known carcenogens and have been shown to migrate into plant tissue.    The problem these caustic and harmful chemicals solve is how international corporations can make money the fastest.  They will convince you to throw your uneaten food and carbon-based waste into the trash can and instead pay for them to extract fertilizer from petroleum sources to grow new food.  There is no way that sort of excess is sustainable.  The ""modern"" way of life is quite ""modern"" but it is not sane, nor rational.  There is no way we can continue to throw away perfectly good resources and continue to mine new resources to replace them.    From the compost heap to materials such as metals and plastics, everything we are throwing into the landfill necessitates more mining, more refining, more manufacturing and more wealth transferred from consumers to the corporations that have grown to unbelievable sizes, larger that most countries, in their wealth and their scope of influence.  We must stop thinking about nature from a ""we are humans, we pummel nature into compliance with our wishes"" and actually apply some logic and rationality to the entire situation.  It is not a ""chemicals versus nature"" line as they would want us to take sides along, but rather a dispute regarding the rational use and application of chemicals, when other methods have failed.  Not simply for your bottom line, but in a sustainable manner that does not promote excess waste production to sustain.  It's not even an ethical or moral question, it is simply that we cannot afford, as a planet, to continue the wasteful mismanagement of resources and misapplication of caustic and toxic substances.

t5_2s7tt,mkglass,1356542613,"While I might agree with you in reference to a fairly strict adherence to English language construction, I must ultimately disagree.  LEGO is a brand, and is most definitely not a noun.  It's more correct to call it an adjective.  They are LEGO bricks, or parts.  Specific collections of bricks are called LEGO sets.  But this is the English language, which is fluid and changing all of the time.  We mold it to our usage as we see fit, and if enough people use the changes, it becomes part of our lexicon.  If you don't believe me, text your friends about the usage of ""text"" as a verb, and how awesome your Nikes are.  LEGO put a notice on their website a while back (which I believe is no longer there -- I leave it to the reader to verify) stating:  &gt; Please always refer to our products as “LEGO bricks or toys” and not “LEGOS.” By doing so, you will be helping to protect and preserve a brand of which we are very proud, and that stands for quality the world over  Many of you may look at this as the deciding factor in this argument.  If you are writing a book on LEGO, or an article in a magazine, I would agree with you.  However, this is a company trying to protect its brand.  They have no jurisdiction over the use of the English language in everyday conversation.  ""Legos"" is used widely enough to be accepted by most people.  And because the entire purpose of language is to use words to convey a thought, as long as you picture LEGO^® Bricks in your head when I say ""Legos,"" mission accomplished.  Besides... are you going to tell THAT kid the proper usage of the term LEGO?

Courses are available in basic rifle, pistol, shotgun, muzzleloading firearms, personal protection, and even ammunition reloading. Additionally, nearly 2,800 Certified Coaches are specially trained to work with young competitive shooters. Since the establishment of the lifesaving Eddie Eagle® Gun Safety Program in 1988, more than 21 million pre-kindergarten to sixth grade children have learned that if they see a firearm in an unsupervised situation, they should ""STOP. DON'T TOUCH. LEAVE THE AREA. TELL AN ADULT."" Over the past seven years, Refuse To Be A Victim® seminars have helped more than 15,000 men and women develop their own personal safety plan using common sense strategies.  &gt;In 1990, NRA made a dramatic move to ensure that the financial support for firearms-related activities would be available now and for future generations. Establishing the NRA Foundation, a 501 (c) (3) tax-exempt organization, provided a means to raise millions of dollars to fund gun safety and educational projects of benefit to the general public. Contributions to the Foundation are tax-deductible and benefit a variety of American constituencies, including youths, women, hunters, competitive shooters, gun collectors, law enforcement agents and persons with physical disabilities.  &gt;While widely recognized today as a major political force and as America's foremost defender of Second Amendment rights, the NRA has, since its inception, been the premier firearms education organization in the world. But our successes would not be possible without the tireless efforts and countless hours of service our nearly four million members have given to champion Second Amendment rights and support NRA programs.

t5_2soy6,aazav,1356575153,"Fine.  Here's your incidental evidence.  I lived through this.  I lived in a house where things moved without us asking them to.  I, my father, my friend and a repairman in the house all  - saw things move in front of them - felt someone touching them when there was no one in the room - saw a gray floating shape in front of them for several seconds that quickly disappeared.  I lived there for a year.    The recounting of my life in a haunted house on Wing Lake Rd. in Birmingham/Bloomfield Michigan.  © Alex Zavatone 1999  The address is on Wing Lake Rd in Birmingham/Bloomfield Township, Mich.  First or second house on the right when entering Wing Lake Rd from the south.  With a gravel driveway, the house was painted yellow when I lived there in 1982.  At that time, I was a sophomore in HS, about 14 or 15, didn't drink, do drugs and was a normal 15 year old kid.  The first night my family lived in the house, all the lights went out in the house except in the garage below the small attic and the attic.  The door to the small attic would slowly open with a creak and then within a minute, slam shut.  Often, when in the house and after standing still, I would get a feeling like someone cold was walking up behind me and putting their hand right over my shoulder.  Quickly turning around would make the feeling go away then it would settle in again.  Like someone was right behind you and you turn around and they are not there.  When eating dinner, the sound of someone bouncing a ball would be heard over our heads.  Like when you drop a ping pong ball and it quickly speeds up its bouncing but this would go over several minutes.  Twice when entering the garage, a large rusty 3 inch nail fell out of a nailless, stucco ceiling, leveled out and zipped in front of me, hitting the garage divider, bouncing off a box and hit the floor with a ping.  Then it disappeared.  This happened to me twice and to my father once, but he was able to pick up the nail. The amazing thing was that the nail took exactly the same path both times it happened to me.  There was no hole in the ceiling left by the nail either.  A pattern was developing that only these things would happen to men, not women.  I never figured out why until after I had moved out of the house.  We had a yard man who lived in Wayne or Pontiac, Mich and was recently unemployed from one of the car companies.  Curious, I asked him if he noticed anything funny happening to him in the house.  He denied any odd happenings until he was painting the room to the small attic and the radio station changed on him while he was listening to it.  After this experience, he informed my mother that when we had any house work he'd call us, and not to call him.  After a while he calmed down but was pretty shook up.  Twice while sleeping, odd things happened in my room.  The first was reminiscent of the old Pepto Bismol commercials where the man in the commercial would bulge and wobble due to his discomfort.  One night, I woke up in the middle of the night and saw my closet doors doing this.  Realizing that there was nothing I could do to change it, I closed my eyes and went back to sleep.  That to me, is a very strange reaction and after we left the house, we wondered if we were insane to live there for a year.  The second incident was a simple ""there is someone walking in my room"".  I could hear footsteps and boards creaking as if someone was entering my room.  There were no depressions in the carpet and only 3 audible steps were taken into my room.  Again, I just went back to sleep.  While playing on the lake ice with my friend Quigley and his dog, we decided to play at my house.  I warned him that it was haunted but we'd make the best of it.  When we approached the house, it took some effort to get the dog into the front yard but a taunting with a tennis ball eventually got the critter onto the grass.  Finally able to grab the dog, we took him off the grass and onto the front porch where he fought against us strongly.  From there, Kevin took the dog by the collar and I opened the front door.  His dog froze, looked up the staircase inside, whimpered, backed off the foundation taking us with him and almost dragged us off the lawn.  We couldn't hold on and the dog just stayed in the street, never coming close to the house or the lawn.  Baffled and not seeing any spectres, Kevin and I entered the house and got cookies.  After the cookie break, we went upstairs and as adolescents started wrestling and beating each other up.  While wrestling about the room, we fell on my solid pine bed and the bed snapped in half.  Now, I had that bed for 12 years and it had taken a beating but it could have just broken.  Kind of embarrassed, we both went downstairs and Kevin left with his dog.  I had another friend named Justin who had a beer can collection like I did.  I kept mine in the small attic and therefore did not go there much.  Knowing that if I invited Justin over, the ghost would pay more attention to someone new, I told him about the haunted house and we went over to check out my beer can collection.  Justin reacted rather well for the first ten minutes except that I didn't have ten minutes of beer cans to see.  He often got a surprised look on his face and tried to brush something off his shoulder.  Three times I asked him if he wanted to leave until he strongly told me that he would tell me when he wanted to go.  He just walked back and forth between the same racks looking at the same cans.  3  minutes later, he asked to leave.  Going down the stairs, I asked him if he felt the ghost touching his back.  Abruptly, he turned to me and without answering my question, told me never, EVER to take him back to that room again.  Years later, I described to him exactly what happened to him (that feeling from paragraph 3) and he was amazed that I was exactly right. ""Like you're walking down a deserted road with no one for thousands of miles and you know there is someone right behind you.""  Nonchalantly, I told him that I lived there for a year and was well accustomed to the feelings of that house.  When we moved to the house, we had a cat.  The cat would normally be a ""house cat"" and stay around the house with a few late night jaunts.  The critter's behavior changed and it rarely spent time around the house and finally left.  Don't really know why but animals did not seem to like this house.  The problems of living in that house were not shared with our neighbors.  Surprisingly, a neighbor from 3 houses up the block would ask me how I was doing and how things were going whenever he would see me.  Only later, I would realize that he was asking me ""are you doing ok in that haunted house?""  Once, my father and I entered the room next to the room that went to the small attic and felt a presence.  We decided to lighten up the atmosphere and started paying attention to the ghost and actively speaking about being nice to the ghost and maybe ""take a ghost to lunch.""  1/2 hour after we started, without a word, we stopped.  An ominous hostile nature hinting ""stop NOW"" was the general feeling that came about the room.  During that time, the feeling on my back could be shrugged or whisked away with a brush of my hand.  1/2 hour later, we both got up and left.  I asked my father who was a former secret agent and not a wimp, ""let's never do that again.""  He quickly agreed.  Coincidentally, at the time that we lived in the house was when Poltergeist was released to theatres.  I definitely went to see that movie.  After a while, it was obvious to the family that I was having trouble living in the house.  Once I asked my dad if anything happened to him that he hadn't told me about.  He recounted a story of a few weeks earlier where he was sitting on the porcelain throne and the wastepaper basket flew across the room without his permission.  My definition of an area influenced by a poltergeist is if inanimate objects fly around the room without you asking them to.  Up until that point, no one had seen our poltergeist and we were set on staying in that house because it was ours.  It's just what you do.  Late one night, I laid down to sleep for about 10 seconds and then suddenly opened my eyes.  What I saw could not exist in a three dimensional world.  In a period less than two seconds long, a gray object entered my room and flew up into the ceiling above it.  I actually get chills just recounting this story.  The object seemed to be a gray blob with enough ""tv screen fuzz"" so that is blended in with the background but was still visible.  When it entered the room, it came in 4 to 6 feet and went straight up into the ceiling but entered at two separate points. It did not stretch, it did not visibly separate, it just entered the ceiling at two separate locations at the same time without deforming itself.  Slightly stunned, I realized that ""I'd seen it"" and that this was not a window reflection of car lights.  Realizing that there was nothing I could do about it, I went to sleep and told my parents about it the next day.  However the final incident was the killer.  I had left Justin, my beer can collecting friend's, house across town where I had stayed while my parents were on vaca in Hilton Head.  At the time I left, the weather was lovely and sunny.  But in the driving 5 miles to our house, the weather turned sour and when we got to my house, large 40 foot trees were moving like they were getting whipped around, the sky was gray and it just didn't make sense that the weather could change that much in 5 miles.  I have never seen anything else like it since.  Continued…",©

To prevent bootleggers from using industrial ethyl alcohol to produce illegal beverages, the government ordered the poisoning of industrial alcohols. In response, bootleggers hired chemists who successfully renatured the alcohol to make it drinkable. As a response, the Treasury Department required manufacturers to add more deadly poisons, including the particularly deadly methyl alcohol. New York City medical examiners prominently opposed these policies because of the danger to human life. As many as 10,000 people died from drinking denatured alcohol before Prohibition ended.[70]  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohibition_in_the_United_States  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuskegee_syphilis_experiment  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syphilis_experiments_in_Guatemala  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_experimentation_in_the_United_States  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_war_crimes  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torture_and_the_United_States   Government™! 100% Incapable of Evil!

This is post-patch, the Conference Called used to be a reason to farm the Warrior, but that weapon has degraded into something that's not really worth using. The Volcano is a decent weapon due to the fact it has a 100% proc rate for burn damage, and has a decent high DoT value. It's not the best sniper in the game (Tumtum Skullsmasher, Tumtum Cobra, etc), but it's decent at best.  Legendary weapons are meant to be just that: Legendary. It's no fun to go into a game to see everyone sporting legendary weapons that you know were just duplicated for them without any hard work. The first legendary I farmed was at level 27, the Minecraft Longbow Sniper. It's one of my first legendary weapons, the next two I farmed was a Bee and CC at level 50. Back then not everyone had a copy of these weapons, so everything I joined a session with someone they would all crowd around in awe at my hard earned weapons. Now that everyone has a copy of everything, well, the diversity of the game is gone because everyone has one.

Given the circumstances and your current presence here in this location it seems logical that you are indeed the one to be held responsible for this cadaver. Further speculation would suggest that given your ability to generate additional revenue for you and your partners through homicide I have no alternative but to believe that aforementioned positive financial stimulus trough the form of your fourth ability must have taken place here. All things considered, I am definitely curious as to how you personally spend this additional financial gain, given that I have not observed any disbursal from you in the recent past.  Templar Assassin, my dear, you have hit the nail on the head completely. Indeed, it is true, my skills in combat have proven proficient enough for me to slay this sea creature with relative ease. As previously described, I have generated additional wealth using my special skillset of abilities, unique to a headhunter of my stature and cunning. The question of how I choose to invest this sum of funds you have so accurately mentioned previously is, in essence, quite elementary in nature. I would be happy to disclose with you the details of said venture. You see, the very funds I obtain in my dastardly line of work I re-invest in other remunerative markets. The nature of these markets may shock and surprise you, however, as the products they produce are, quite frankly, scandalous and somewhat ironic given my particular skillset. As it happens, the market I choose to invest in is the very producers of charms and trinkets aimed to thwart my own behavior! As outrageous as it may seem, the very tools used in order to circumvent my illusion of camouflage are indeed funded by my own hand!

t5_2qh62,mikeymop,1356711822,"1) I dont know if you know what a partition is so I'll tell you anyway. Its essentially a giant directory, every OS has to be installed in one, even if the partition takes up the entire Harddrive. Windows sees partitions as separate harddrives and every partition is formatted differently to accomidate the OS installed on it. (Windows is NTFS, Linux is ext3 or 4, OSX is HFS+). Because each os uses different drive formats they need to format the partition before they can be stored on it.  When you go through the installer there is an option to install over the entire drive, this will install OVER windows. Take note however this will erase any data on the Windows partition. If you're 100% sure that's the outcome you want you can continue from there and Ubuntu will do everything for you, including setting up swap space. Swap space is where Linux caches files to disk, it's similiar to the page file in Windows if you're familiar with that. It is also required if you want to use hibernation.  2) I can't ensure your wireless will still be working without knowing what model # it is. After searching for your laptop I found three possible wireless card options, excluding 3g wireless cards so you'll have to confirm that with us. It's either an Intel® PRO/Wireless 3945A/G (802.11a/g), Dell Wireless 1490 (802.11a/g), or a Dell Wireless 1390 (802.11g).  4) As for office applications Ubuntu comes with Libre Office which is comparable, there are other alternatives I personally prefer OpenOffice, which libre office is based off of. You can run MS office under Wine, a compatibility stack for Windows applications however I dont think it's worth the effort to get it running.",®

If the goal is to ensure better use of health services, finding and eliminating inefficiencies across the continuum of care holds much more promise.      Tags: Healthcare financing Public/private mix   Tough economic times stir up anxiety over the affordability of public services—especially healthcare. As governments struggle to balance budgets, and healthcare spending continues to grow faster than the economy, conditions are ripe for old—and often discredited—policy ideas to make a comeback. User fees are no exception. At first blush, user fees appear to be an obvious solution. After all, any policy that promises to generate revenue[1] and reduce costs by deterring unnecessary use is hard to ignore.[1,2]  But as research has shown over the years, the silver bullet of user fees really is the stuff of fantasy.[3]  The evidence indicates that implementing a medical toll booth to reduce healthcare traffic along a particular route can obstruct access to needed care, especially for those that are poor.[4]  Viewing patients as responsible for the high costs of healthcare ignores the evidence against user fees and the opportunities for greater efficiency that can be found along the continuum of care.[5]  A medical toll booth simply won’t do the trick.  The Tangle of Necessary and Unnecessary Care  The RAND Health Insurance Experiment, the largest and most rigorous study of user fees to date, found that the more patients had to pay for care, the less they used it.[6,7]  Less care led to lower costs, but it didn’t mean greater efficiency, because sometimes people received fewer services when they actually needed more. Patients did reduce their use of less-effective care, but there was a decrease in the use of effective care as well.[7]  The RAND findings also showed that the proportion of inappropriate hospital stays and admissions was the same with or without user fees.[8]  The RAND findings have stood the test of time. In one study, user fees lowered the appropriate use of effective prevention services and medications to help manage chronic diseases.[4]  User fees have also been shown to reduce inappropriate as well as appropriate antibiotic use to a similar extent.[9]  Savings At Any Cost   In Canada, user fees were introduced in Saskatchewan in the sixties and seventies. Subsequent research found that they reduced the annual use of physician services by almost 6%. Notably, low-income families reduced their use of physician services by about 18%.[10]  Saskatchewan's overall healthcare costs, however, did not go down. Indeed, over the period user fees were levied, physician fees increased and high income earners on average increased their use of physician services.[11]   User fees may also cause some people to forego necessary treatment. In Quebec, for instance, when the elderly and people on welfare had to pay user fees for prescription drugs, they took less medicine and their conditions worsened. **As a result, they ended up with more visits to emergency departments and an increase in serious adverse events.[12]**   **A study of seniors insured through U.S. Medicare found that raising user fees for physician visits and prescriptions increased Medicare costs.[13]  As in Quebec, many patients stopped taking their medications and ended up in the hospital.** These findings are supported by a 2007 systematic review of prescription drug cost-sharing.[14] Researchers found that although it is not certain that user fees lead to negative outcomes for all patients, their effect on the chronically ill was clear: increased emergency department use and hospitalizations.[14]  Who Pays the Price   The Canada Health Act effectively bans user fees for two main health services: hospitals and physicians.[15]  There are good reasons for this. User fees shift costs to those that use the system the most: sick people. This amounts to a tax on poverty and age, since the poor and the elderly are less healthy than other groups.[15,16,17,18]   The poor are especially sensitive to these fees, which have led to policies that exempt them from user charges. A 2010 report examining the possibility of a health deductible in Quebec suggested that such an exemption would thwart much of the revenue-generating potential of user fees.[19]  Because healthcare utilization tends to be concentrated among low-income Canadians, low-income exemptions would significantly reduce the proportion of patients paying user fees.[19]   The poor are negatively affected by user fees in other ways, too. A study looking at the effects of prescription drug user fees found that low-income patients were more likely to stop taking medications to treat chronic disease.[20]  These results are not surprising, as in the RAND study adverse health effects due to a decline in care were concentrated among low-income families.[21,7]  User fees are a blunt instrument for targeting waste. They are aimed exclusively at patients, but patients have very little control over which medical services they use.[11,22]  Patients choose whether or not to visit a doctor, but ongoing care and big-ticket items are ordered by physicians, the “gatekeepers” of the healthcare system.[23,11,22]  What’s more, physician fees account for only 14% of healthcare expenditures.[24]  Patients are not solely responsible for the high costs of healthcare,[3] so it doesn’t make sense to put cost containment on their shoulders. Conclusion  While user fees are effectively banned for hospitals and family physicians in Canada, we continue to have them for many other aspects of healthcare.[25]    If our goal is to ensure better use of health services, the evidence shows that user fees have not been capable of achieving it. Finding and eliminating inefficiencies across the continuum of care holds much more promise. The shift toward integrated and coordinated care delivery systems is encouraging, especially where they have been designed to meet the needs of specific populations.[26]  That said, efforts to integrate healthcare services continue to be frustrated by user fees (routinely required for visits to physiotherapists, psychologists and for home care support, etc.) that can create access barriers to the most appropriate services.

""Brzo, idi dolje i probudi časnu sestru! Reci joj da čim prije dođe gore!"" Dječačić trči u polusnu niz stepenice dok starac duboko diše i shvaća da je namirisao ništa drugo, doli krv... Kasnije tu noć telefonski razgovori su obavljeni, golubovi pismonoše su poslani, a u neuspjelom pokušaju slanja e-maila, tipkovnica, monitor i nekoliko kabela su proglašeni vražjim izumima. Kocka je bačena. Starac se vraća u krevet i jedva čeka sutradan vidjeti plodove svoga poziva u pomoć...  Sljedeće jutro starac užurbano otvara novine, međutim par minuta kasnije shvati da kao pojačanje nije stigla konjica, već konjina!  Da elaboriram. Karamarko već sad počinje predizbornu kampanju jer zna da mu je revolver napunjen ćorcima, ali zna i da ako nekome u uho govoriš iste stvari dovoljno dugo, postoji velika vjerojatnost da će se sjeme tih misli primiti i bujati. A tri godine je jako dugo vremena. Međutim, problem ili sreća je što naš protagonist, blago rečeno, nije vješt s riječima. Kao ni s mozgom. Niz njegovih kontradiktornih izjava je kulminirao [danas kada je HDZ apelirao](http://www.novilist.hr/Vijesti/Hrvatska/HDZ-trazi-da-zdravstveni-odgoj-bude-izborni-predmet) da:  &gt; ""...zdravstveni odgoj bude izborni predmet.""  No, Karamarku čak i njegovi protivnici moraju pomagati kao što je i [ministar Jovanović morao danas](http://www.glasistre.hr/vijesti/hrvatska/jovanovic-zdravstveni-odgoj-ide-dalje-371992):  &gt; Na molbu novinara osvrnuo se i na izjavu predsjednika HDZ-a Tomislava Karamarka da je uvođenje zdravstvenog odgoja uvod u ukidanje vjeronauka u školama, istaknuvši da je stvarnost zapravo suprotna jer, objasnio je, kada bi se zdravstveni odgoj uveo kao izborni predmet, onda bi iz škola vjerojatno nestalo vjeronauka.  &gt; ""Gospodin Karamarko ima problema sa zaključivanjem. Njegov prijedlog da zdravstveni odgoj bude izborni predmet ide u smjeru da dio djece neće izabrati vjeronauk. Možda će izabrati zdravstveni odgoj pa vjeronauka više neće biti"", rekao je Jovanović. Dodao je da uvođenjem zdravstvenog odgoja zapravo pomaže da vjeronauk ne bude ukinut te da je dovoditi zdravstveni odgoj u vezu s vjeronaukom dokaz da gospodin Karamarko ništa ne razumije pa mu on ne može pomoći.  Da, nekim ljudima se jednostavno ne može pomoći, ali neka je što više našeg Karamarka u medijima, ipak hrvatski humor nije baš kvalitetan a ovaj lik me zna baš dobro nasmijati. Smijeh je lijek za sve, a zbog Karamarka se osjećam zdravo.  Ajd, barem je misterij gotovo bezbojnih usta s nijansama smeđeg napokon riješen. Očito Karamarko dosta vremena provodi ispod nečije svečane halje, samo što ne zna ni dobro obrisati gubicu poslije svakog 'sakramenta'...",™

You DO NOT belong in a household filled with that kind of abnormal behaviour, nor does your sister. I feel extremely bad that your mom will not leave him. However, that is not the main issue we need to be worrying about. We need to concentrate on that later. The first step is to TELL AN OUTSIDER about your SITUATION AT HOME. It is absolutely crucial that you do this. It is pretty much the only thing you can do to stop this, so that you will have a chance for happiness and start over. Please do not kill your father. However I believe you are allowed to defend yourself. This situation is affecting every part of your life, so far that you are even considering suicide (which is an illogical conclusion on your part). It is also affecting school, even though you get good grades you can't enjoy it unless you have a balanced life. Your father says you are a disappointment even though you are clearly excelling in academics, getting  top grades even. You should not believe him, I know it is hard he is your father after all, but bad, abusive parents are not always right. Fathers are supposed to PROTECT and ENCOURAGE - you will learn that later, too, once you get in to a safe environment and not have an abusive household constantly on your mind. You say you expect things to get better, and you can begin to expect that again once you tell someone. Tell the school staff as soon as possible. Please PM me. (♥ HOPE♥)",♥

Please check the corresponding audio before quoting in print.  © 2012 Chicago Public Media &amp; Ira Glass Prologue.  Ira Glass Noah, Abraham, King Solomon-- they all sacrificed animals, right? That's just the way they did it in the Old Testament. That's how you worshipped God. And the Old Testament is pretty unambiguous that this is God's very favorite way for people to worship. Exodus says that we're supposed to continue doing this ""for generations to come.""  Deuteronomy warns us against worshipping in other ways, quote, ""detestable ways that God hates. See that you do all I command you. Do not add to it or take away from it.""  So as a kid going to Hebrew school in suburban Baltimore, I never understood why we weren't doing this for God, how we got off the hook from animal sacrifice, the thing that he specifically said was the very best way to show our feelings for him. And it wasn't until this week that I finally learned the reason that we were off the hook. And the reason turns out to be astonishingly simple. Here's a scholar from Boston University named Jonathan Klawans, who is deeply over-qualified to answer this question.  Jonathan Klawans The book of Deuteronomy actually also makes very clear that the only legitimate place for sacrifice is in the place where the Lord God will choose.  Ira Glass And the place that God chose was the temple in Jerusalem. When that was destroyed back in the year 70, it became basically illegal for Jews to sacrifice animals anywhere. Anyway, Jonathan Klawans says that there is a real bias against sacrifice today that began with people centuries ago.  Jonathan Klawans None of these people were vegetarians. These weren't animal rights motivations. This was a notion that somehow prayer is better than sacrifice because it's more meaningful. It's more spiritual. In a way, I view sacrificers as a historical underdog.  Ira Glass In our conversation, by the way, he was careful to point out that he is not an advocate for animal sacrifice. Hold those emails. But he wrote a book that covers this material called Purity, Sacrifice, and the Temple. And he thinks that modern people have not bothered to think through what it would feel like to bring an animal to temple to kill it, to burn parts of it-- or all of it-- as a gift that you were personally giving to the creator of everything.  Jonathan Klawans It's stuff. One is giving something. One of the points that's often emphasized, even in the biblical tradition-- and also in later rabbinic tradition-- about sacrifice is that a proper sacrifice is something that one owns. You can't go steal an animal and sacrifice it to God. And we also have to remember even if we think of animals as property, ancients-- one has to imagine the domesticated life of people, shepherds, living with their animals, who know their animals. A proper sacrifice has to be unblemished.  To have an unblemished goat, one has to really care for that goat, from the time that the goat is born, to ensure that that goat will not become blemished in some way.  Ira Glass So you have a relationship with that goat. When you inspect it for blemishes-- which is Bible speak for any kind of nick, or bruise, or anything-- the goat looks you in the eye. And when you give this animal that you personally know to God, God isn't some abstract being. He is someone, someone who takes delight when you bring something to him, who you have this very literal interaction with. The Bible talks about the smell of the smoke reaching and summoning God.  Jonathan Klawans So yes, there's something really powerful there. There's a ancient writer who writes in the Roman defense of sacrifices. And he says, worship without sacrifice is just words.  I love that phrase, because it totally turns us on our head. We moderns assume that prayer is better than sacrifice. We're so programmed to this. We think that words are better than deeds. Or we think that thoughts are better than actions. But talk is cheap.  Ira Glass Of course, what the animal gets out of this transaction-- the Bible doesn't say a lot about that. But understanding sacrifices, weighing the sacrifice that an animal makes for us, that raises some very basic questions.  Man 1 What is sacrifice?",©

He sits down and shows it to me. He looked into my eyes and knew my young mind was captivated at the girl with huge cans just looking at me seductively. My father then proceeded to swat me with the magazine to snap me out of my trance. He opened it open and began talking: ""Son, do you know what they are doing?"" I looked at him confused and said no. ""Well these two are having sex; I won't lie to you this is how babies are made and it feels awesome when you do it."" By this point his flipping through the magazine and showing me the girl getting banged; my face is red in embarassment and shock. Dad looked at me and smiled ""I recommend you not doing it before you are married, but if you do son, wrap it before you tap it"".  After that talk dad took me to the backyard and said no pornos allowed in the house and we burned the magazine.  TL;DR: Dad gives me talk by using a Penthouse magazine.",™

t5_2qh6c,captainhaddock,1356771784,"I think you're right in suspecting that inerrancy always implies some literalism, and literalism always implies inerrancy. It should also be obvious that all ""literalists"" selectively interpret much of the Bible non-literally, and inerrantists who insist they're not literalists are really asserting that it is their own interpretations that are inerrant.  ""Scripture interpreting Scripture"", in practice, means that the parts whose plain reading you disagree with get reinterpreted to conform with the parts you do agree with.  Ultimately, the Bible is just too diverse for inerrancy to be a useful interpretation principle. Instead, it is a posture (a façade) that people use to demonstrate their loyalty to a religious establishment. (*If only those Catholics/Anglicans/liberal Christians were as committed to Biblical truth™ as we are.*).  &gt; Here, if by ""the teaching of Scripture on creation and the flood"" they mean something akin to young earth creation and a global flood, then this would make it sound like inerrancy does take specific stances on how passages ought to be interpreted and that innerancy and literal readings are synonymous.  I think they've left it loose enough that you can go either way, but the clear meaning of their statement is that Creationism is true and a global flood really happened. Much like the part that says ""We deny the legitimacy of any treatment of the text or quest for sources lying behind it that leads to relativizing, dehistoricizing, or discounting its teaching, or rejecting its claims to authorship."" In other words, research done through textual criticism, higher criticism, history and archaeology that overturn certain assumptions about the Bible, particularly the inerrancy of its historical narratives and authorship claims, is not allowed. Inquiry is not encouraged when dogma determines in advance what the answer must be.",™

t5_2qj8f,darwinsaves,1356776755,"&gt;Bottom line... is the website linked in the OP telling the correct numbers? It appears they might be.  I don't know.  It's possible.  The thing is, they are the only source I could find with the same numbers, and I couldn't find any study that would validate it.  That doesn't mean it's wrong, it just means **I** don't know.  Anyone who says different on here is speculating, or has peer-reviewed data they aren't sharing.  Not knowing is fine, because it leads us to find out eventually, unlike a lot of others on here that just misrepresent info and perpetuate charlatanism.  My opinion is that the numbers from Eggland's best are likely to be exaggerated highly (it's very likely, in fact).  They probably list the highest numbers out of the control group, which most likely couldn't be reproduced reliably in a detailed study. My opinion is that this is advertising at its ""finest"" (read: worst).  It isn't a shocker that a corporation would want to find the most favorable way to portray its product, but I think they do so in this case disingenuously.  They can probably get away with it legally, as well (it doesn't say every egg contains this amount, just that the eggs were tested displayed those attributes).  Plus, the FDA does literally almost nothing in terms of claim evaluation, data confirmation, or ingredient verification, unless there are numerous complaints and/or claims filed against the recurrent offender.  Keep doing what you are doing.  Karma votes aren't an indicator of quality.  Most people just want their own comfortable thoughts to be validated.  There are exceptions, and especially so on /r/skeptic, but many of these people are science-minded, socially inept people that need things presented to them in a certain way.  I almost never say I know anything for sure, as opposed to the philosophunculists present on other subreddits, which will tell you the sun revolves around the Earth if they need to turn a debate to their favor.  I'm saying that telling people you don't know anything makes you smarter, see?  Wait...  Never mind, you get the point, I guess.  Keep up the good work.  **EDIT:  Oh, and the Nutritiondata.self isn't verified at all.  I cannot find a source for any values, except for one...  It tailors its values to a new age diet site of questionable integrity.  It appears to me that they copy and paste data, omitting their sources, or just guess it.  most of it is close enough.  The farmed vs. wild comparison has been widely debunked for nutritional value (but not aesthetically for salmon, whom have color added due to lack of krill in their diets).  I wouldn't be so quick to dismiss the egg thing without proof, but I'm leaning toward leaving them out, due to the fact that they are an outlier that cannot provide sources against what the consensus says.**  &gt;IF Rating™ is a trademark of Monica Reinagel.

How do I configure my PC to take advantage of AMD Radeon™ Dual Graphics?  &gt;A3: To take advantage of AMD Radeon™ Dual Graphics, you must use a compatible AMD A-Series APU to pair with your supported AMD Radeon™ HD 6000 Series card. After installation of your graphics card, install the latest AMD graphics drivers. After driver installation, the option to enable AMD Radeon™ Dual Graphics should become available in the AMD VISION Engine Control Center.   &gt;Once installed, go into the “Performance” section of the AMD VISION Engine Control Center and check the box that says 'Enable Crossfire™' - this will allow the AMD A-Series APU graphics to work in tandem with the select AMD Radeon™ HD 6000 Series GPU installed for increased graphics performance.  &gt;Q4: Where do I plug my monitor in to get the best performance when using AMD Radeon™ Dual Graphics technology?   &gt;A4: For best performance, AMD recommends plugging the display into your discrete graphics card. This will ensure that even applications that do not take advantage of AMD Radeon™ Dual Graphics will still be able to run on the faster graphics card in your system. However, to be more accurate, we recommend that you plug your monitor into the AMD Radeon™ graphics with the higher model number. If that is your APU, plug into the motherboard, if it is your discrete graphics card, plug into that.",™

It seems as though you are viewing Anon solely through the lens of Reddit, which is awfully distorting.    &gt;You are essentially enforcing your arbitrary beliefs onto other people.  That's what humans do.   u mad?  &gt;If you say that you should do unto others as you would like done unto you, then why? There is no justification for this rule.  /r/Christianity is that way ↗  &gt;If you say ""we hold no beliefs,"" and then at a later time say ""rape is wrong"" you are either lying or stupid. Besides saying ""we hold no beliefs""..... is a belief itself.  It is analogous to President Obama saying chocolate ice cream is the best flavor, and then some guy in Iowa thinking that means he banned all other forms of ice cream. You can find Anons that hold any and all beliefs that exist; there are very few that are nihilist enough to hold none at all. When you hear an Anon say ""We hold no beliefs"", I think they're referring to the hivemind as a whole, as when they say ""Rape is wrong"" they're talking about their own personal beliefs, which are different than those of the whole.  &gt;Or I get this a lot from liberals ""you have no right to enforce your beliefs on others"".... except for that belief, which you will enforce on others.  lol, You sound like you came from 4chan /pol/. You should really stop hanging out with so many liberal Anons then if they bother you so much. Find some stormfags or lolbertarian Anons, there are plenty around.   &gt;You then say ""we aren't political"" yet you want internet freedom... which is very political.   How so? I don't think it's political at all.  I think Anon as a whole is against the politicization of the internet just as much as they're against corporate or government regulation of it.   &gt;Why should you have internet freedom? Why should you have rights? If you can't absolutely answer these, then you are being just as arbitrary as the people you fight against, and you are enforcing your beliefs onto them.  The internet should be a protected public utility like landline telephone  or electrical service, not a cash cow for megacorporations or a spying tool for nosy government agencies. Of course Anon is arbitrary, that's kind of the point of Anon: it's an arbitrary gathering of like-minded individuals, or just one individual working toward a shared goal. You are ""(en)forcing your beliefs"" on others just by posting this. See how it works?  You are Anonymous.  &gt;Another thing, people always say anon is doing good things, but, when they do something bad (and I am assuming morality for this statement), like finding naked pictures of a girl and sending them to her friends on Facebook to shame her, or hacking a tea-party website (which had no beef with anonymous) they brush it off and say ""well anon isn't an organized group of people so you really can't say it was there fault."" And when they do something good ""I love anon, they do so much good things!!""  It sounds to me like you're butthurt over the reaction Anon gets that cannot be controlled by Anonymous itself. Anon does things for the lulz more often than they do things for the greater good. This has always been the case. I don't know what specific instances you're talking about, but I know that they attacked the Oregon Tea Party a few years ago over the use of their catch phrases, not that they need a reason beyond 'lulz' to attack anyone, especially a political group.   Foolish people who post naked pics to facebook (where they are easily gotten) shouldn't be surprised when others come looking for naked pics, anonymous or not.   &gt;So what, anon can only do good things? When they do something bad it's not anon, but when they do something good it's always anon?  cue the theme song to [*The Facts of Life*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGS56qJ0xIw)   &gt;What is bad, and what is good? How do you know you are doing bad or good if you haven't defined what is bad or good?  Why does it have to be defined at all? Why can't it be as simple as a [hedonistic declaration](http://i2.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/000/142/feelsgood.jpg) ? If you need there to be a moral at all costs then there are well established groups like Amnesty International or The Masons, just to name two random ones.   Perhaps some propagandist Anon upset you at some point? The people who say ""Anon only do good things"" are either wrong out of ignorance or just trolling you. Everything you hear Anon say should be taken with the proverbial grain of salt.  &gt;Why do not forgive? What does that mean?   Well for one thing the saying is never supposed to be without its tandem ""We do not forget"". Forgiving and forgetting is what young people are frequently taught who get mad, and Anon is simply saying they reject that notion. It's not even true 100% of the time. Due to the constant coming-and-going aspect, many Anons don't have any inkling of what Anon was doing years ago, nor do they care. Often the left hand of Anonymous doesn't know what the right hand is doing, and often the right hand is busy fapping while the left hand is scolding others for wanting to fap.   &gt;You will punish people based on your arbitrary set of moral values, and you wont make exceptions?  I don't know where you got this from, but you couldn't be more wrong. Of course there are exceptions, but that doesn't mean Anon has to go around telling everyone what those exceptions are. Other Anons may congratulate someone or something that other Anons are busy condemning and/or attacking. (see left hand/right hand analogy from the previous)  All in all I think you've got the wrong idea about Anonymous. Maybe you should get on IRC and stop paying attention to the moralfag Anons around here. I think you'd see that it's much more of a democratic system where there is no real consensus on actions, just the tyranny of the majority, or individuals acting under the Anon brand name.  It''s fine to be mad at Anonymous (especially those claiming to be Anon on reddit), but don't think for a moment that all of Anonymous is represented by the people you're mad at.  After all, by posting this you are just as Anonymous (or pseudonymous) as the rest of us, which proves that not all Anons are as like minded as you seem to think.  ***tl;dr:*** Anonymous is as Anonymous does. Don't try to analyze it too much because there doesn't have to be a ""good"" reason.",↗

t5_2t160,christ0ph,1356821229,"My concern about it is that it preserves an insurance system that is really destructive to our ability to afford insurance, and is wasteful. As a canadian, you should be familiar with the many studies that have been done on user fees. Basically, its been found that to have user fees (insurance premiums and co-pays) actually makes healthcare more expensive in the long run.. The fact is, that people who get care earlier end up costing a lot less in the long run. the US system wastes more than a third of every dollar that goes into it, part of the reason is the complexity of having more than 1500 different payers.  This web page ""busts the myth"" that having user fees (charging people money to access healthcare services) saves money..

t5_2rnve,cabose1fn,1356827979,"Yes that is called a CrossFire Bridge.  The tests that say it is nearly double are almost right.  In some games you can see as much as double the fps but this is not true in all cases.  In farcray 3 with both of my 6870 in I would get an average of 35 fps.  That doesn't sound to bad right. with 1 card I got an average fps of 45.  With 2 cards I had a higher peak fps but the game would experience a lot more lag spikes.  The reason is that the drivers and the games don't know how to properly use 2 video cards at the same time.  Crossfire is getting better every time AMD releases new drivers but for some people it causes games to be unplayable.  Some people have a great time with Crossfire.   Asrock says that is supports [Crossfire on their website](http://www.asrock.com/mb/Intel/H77%20Pro4MVP/).   Here is the line that I am looking at: ""1 x PCIe 3.0 x16 Slot, Supports AMD Quad CrossFireX™ and CrossFireX™""  it is the 4th bullet point.

t5_2qh1i,KillaPeas,1356839272,"Imperial historical logs; as compiled by Commissar T.G.

The furry abominations, committing the hideous blasphemy of wearing sacred power armor as if in service to the God-Emperor, had been leveling city after city for days. And now... they had advanced upon the capitol city, the last bastion of humanity. However, little did anyone realize that the incursion had been noticed by one of the greatest Chapters of all Space Marines -- whose mighty Battle Barge was even now entering orbit around the planet -- the Angry Marines.  ""GODDAMMIT, WHY AREN'T WE ON THE GROUND YET?"" screamed an armored visage. What remained of his face, had been twisted recognizably by sheer rage. ""Sir, we can't enter the atmosphere that quickly, we'd burn u-"" The voice of the Servitor was cut short as he was crushed beneath the sheer weight of the Marine's armor as he jumped into the pilot terminal. Thus, the Battle Barge, the Litany of Litany's Litany, began its screaming descent towards the besieged planet.  All the while, a cacophony of sickly sounds continued to permeate from the murky planet below.  ""Yiff...yiff...yiff...yiff...""  It was maddening; sufficiently so that any lesser man would have taken his own life. But it had no affect on the stalwart Marines of rage save to infuriate them like never before.  At the same time (and unknown to their brethren on the first Battle Barge, or vice versa), a second Battle Barge of the Chapter, the Maximum FUCK, hovered at the ready directly over the capital city. Upon it, poised the payload of Adeptus Astartes Angry Marines, prepared to make planetfall. Captain Temperus of the 3rd Company watched and waited, his eyes fixed firmly on the screens showing a wave of mutants overrunning the planetary defense force positions. He felt his blood boil as he looked upon the livery adorning their armor, their mockery of everything they stood for. Their faces were an abomination. The heretical glee, visible on their faces even from space, angered the Brother Captain even moar. The comms-servant gave a silent nod, and although it seemed as though he hadn't seen it, Temperus was well aware. It was time-- but he hadn't the patience for any conventional strike, this time. ""CUNT SNIFFING FAGGOT MOTHERFUCKERS!"" He bellowed with rage. With the full force of his forehead, Captain Temperus struck the large red button on the console in front of him, destroying it in the process. Great shields on the side of the Battle Barge turned into place over the front of the craft, forming a giant battering ram shaped like a middle finger. The Maximum FUCK began its nose-first descent into the atmosphere.  The fighting around the capitol city grew more and more fierce. The furred mutants were sending their numbers to die beneath the walls of the city; each one attempting to use their bladed weapon to try and chip away at the hardened rockrete. At first the defenders jeered at their foolhardiness. But as more corpses piled around the walls, the more precarious became the city's chances. ""Keep up that heavy bolter fire!"" the Commissar screamed over the din of the gun placements. ""Bring up the flamers! Show these abominations the cleansing power of The Emperor!"" Just then a Servitor scuttled up to the Commissar's side. ""Milord, crafts from offworld are making planetfall. It appears to be the Adeptus Astartes."" ""Ah, at last. Now we shall TRULY turn the tide against this filth!"" beamed the Commissar. In revelry and decadence, the furries fought and continued to advance. The city would soon fall, there was none alive on Tertius Gamma who could stop them now.  Suddenly, all heads turned skywards, eyes scanning above to find the source of a terrible noise. The two Angry Marines Battle Barges collided sides-first against one another as they plummeted towards a single target. The mutants realized that target was them. The Commissar turned his eyes skywards as the enemy fell silent and a great shadow fell across the lands. ""What the fuck..."" the Commissar uttered under his breath, in disbelief.  ""FUCK YOU, I WAS HERE FIRST!!!"" screamed the commander aboard the Litany of Litany's Litany, as he piloted his barge directly into the heart of the mutant hordes below. ""NO FUCK YOU, I DEPLOYED THE FINGER!!!"" Captain Temperus cursed back.  Traitors fled, mutants hid, deviants cried out for their dark gods to save them. As one, then two Battle Barges slammed into the enemy lines. With a terrifying roar, the planet itself was torn asunder! Tertius Gamma was no more.  +++++  Thought for the Day: Suffer not the Furry to live.  +++++ ",♦

t5_2qh2p,Dudesan,1356840201,"I've heard many christians claim that there's a distinction between ""moral, civil, and ceremonial laws"", but not one has ever been able to give me a straight answer about how they tell the difference between the three. It's clearly about what they find personally distasteful or silly, but admitting that that was the case would rather undermine their positions, so don't expect them to admit it. Apart from a few commands which were explicitly intended for a specific people at a specific time, there is absolutely nothing to indicate that most of these laws weren't supposed to be binding for everyone for all time. Indeed, in many places (See Leviticus 23:21, for example), it's explicitly stated that they *are*.  Remember, many Christians find it more comfortable to believe in a god who doesn't condone, command or commit murder, slavery, rape, child abuse, animal abuse, arson, torture, ritual mutilation, fratricide, patricide, matricide, infanticide, genocide, and so on than to believe in one who does.   Unfortunately, since the Bible (Old Testamant and New) is pretty clear about Yahweh's position on these things, holding a belief in Loving Hippie Jesus™ requires ignoring huge portions of it. Or just never reading it in the first place, which seems to be the most popular option.  Well, let's see what Jesus has to say about that:  &gt;“Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished.  (Matthew 5:17-18, NIV)  Some Christians claim that his death and resurrection ""fulfill"" this. That is bullshit for one simple reason: last time I checked, Heaven and Earth haven't passed away.  Jesus also made his views on people ""picking and choosing"" quite clear:  &gt;[Jesus] answered them, “And why do you break God’s commandment because of your tradition? For God said:    *Honor your father and your mother;* and, *The one who speaks evil of father or mother must be put to death.*  &gt; But you say, ‘Whoever tells his father or mother, “Whatever benefit you might have received from me is a gift committed to the temple”—  he does not have to honor his father.’ In this way, you have revoked God’s word because of your tradition. Hypocrites! Isaiah prophesied correctly about you when he said:    &gt;These people honor Me with their lips, but their heart is far from Me.  They worship Me in vain, teaching as doctrines the commands of men.”  (Matthew 15:3-9, NIV)   Looks like Jesus has quite a bit to say about people who ignore commandments, in fact. But maybe it's just Matthew?  &gt;It is easier for heaven and earth to disappear than for the least stroke of a pen to drop out of the Law.  (Luke 16:17, NIV)  Okay, so Jesus is a bust. Let's see what the Epistles have to say about the Mosaic Code:  &gt; If you really keep the royal law found in Scripture, “Love your neighbor as yourself,” you are doing right.  But if you show favoritism, you sin and are convicted by the law as lawbreakers. For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it.   (James 2:8-10, NIV)  &gt;All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness,  (2 Timothy 3:16)  &gt;Do we, then, nullify the law by this faith? Not at all! Rather, we uphold the law.  (Romans 3:31)  &gt;Know this first of all, that *there is no prophecy of scripture that is a matter of personal interpretation*, for no prophecy ever came through human will; but rather human beings moved by the holy Spirit spoke under the influence of God.""  (2 Peter 1:20-21 NAB) ",™
t5_2to41,UnstoppableBeast,1356840231,"Hey man, I understand your pain.  Let me tell you a tale of the *Great Shitscapade*.  'Twas nary a few years ago that I slumbered upon a midsummer's eve, a tepid breeze tickled my toes as I slept with only the lightest of coverings. It was a hot summer, that one, one that could leave sweat on the hardiest man's brow...but enough on the scenery, now we shall get on with the real **meat** of the story.   After having had a wonderful dream of emptying my bladder into a porcelain bowl fit for kings, I had awoke to find that my dream had come true (you've heard of the man from Peru, yes?), so with my piss soaked sheets I embarked on my walk of shame half-naked and hurried so my parents were none the wiser.   Circa 5:00 AM I return to my bed, changed and hastily washed, ready to complete my 8 hours of sleep. Again I drifted off into blissful nothingness, but -on my awakening- a dark and powerful storm brewed on the horizon. The shit-stream left my body with the explosive force of Vesuvius; the mighty Hephaestus himself might have used the heat and pressure to form the mightiest weapon known to all the gods of Olympus. Before I even had a chance to grab something, my Xbox pajama pants became heavy with a diabolical concoction of Satan's own devising.   It was not your typical ""splattering"", but rather a flow of foul magma that had been flowing through my intestinal tract for all too long and finally **seeped** its way out of crater that it would soon leave in my ass. I shit you not...if let harden overnight, a 1/1000th scale of the Hawaiian islands wouldn't be too hard to imagine.  So, what was a young man to do? Surely I waited for this assault on my  pride to be over with before I attempted clean up? No, in shock and horror I waddle-crawled to the bathroom passing three rooms over a carpeted area all while this volcanic anus slug slowly sputtered from my deepest recesses with a solid chunk ""plunking"" out every now and then.  The carpet was doused in OxiClean® and a year later we moved out of that house.

The RadianRXT is NCAP crash tested, the industry benchmark for verifying child seat performance in severe accident conditions, and the **only car seat rated for LATCH use with a child up to 80 lbs.** The RadianRXT sits low on a vehicle seat for easy child boarding, features memory foam padding and infant support pillows. Expandable sides and a longer seat bottom provide extra room and comfort for your growing child. One cup holder is included, with the option to add up to 4 cup holders. In addition to all this versatility, it folds flat for travel and storage, has a 10 year life and offers amazing safety, comfort and convenience your child won’t outgrow.  http://www.us.diono.com/en/car-seats/radian-rxt  It's not cheap but the igh weight limits sold me and the safety is top notch. It is also very slim (all the other seats I looked at looked overbulky).",®
t5_2spi9,zeppo_shemp,1356847693,"&gt;What unique resources do you feel a Men's Success Center would provide?  Maybe they could have resources for male survivors of sex abuse at UVU who have panic attacks in class because the textbooks for English 2600 say things like ""rape is a hate crime that The Patriarchy® uses to control women."" What about men abused by women? (15% of boys are sexually abused, and 40% of the abuse is committed by women; see Dube et al, ""Long-Term Consequences of Childhood Sexual Abuse by Gender of Victim"" [2005])   Oh well, male victims they don't fit into the hypothetical paradigm promoted by Christa Albrecht-Crame and her pseudo-radical colleagues, so anyone who presents hard data that contradicts their social-constructionist bullshit must be ridiculed in class.

t5_2tifv,AlphaLima,1356847742,"&gt; Is there some mode in MP people just can fly and have fun?  Its all based on the map makers. Most maps are mission based so they all have combat in mind, but our training map only has training ranges so you could throw a server up with it or play with someone running it. Nothing would force you to engage if you really diddnt want to, just stay away from hard range as it has threats in it that can engage up to about FL180. Its not a total world like FSX, just the Georgia/Russian area but its also not small.   The TACANs work and you can even shoot an ILS approach, although the virtual ATC system is best ignored (coming from a RW ATC). In fact one of our members here is working on an IFR procedure/tutorial video set, although its very much a WIP. Its also not a perfect piece of software, it has many crashing bugs that are annoying and seemingly random at times. Some get fixed, others show up but with no real competition we're sorta dedicated to putting up with it.

t5_2cneq,Soltheron,1356857679,"&gt;While we are at it, please send me a check  No one cares about your false equivalence; birth control isn't purely for recreational use you ignorant Neanderthal.  Besides, the kind of individual donations that you want are incredibly ineffective at helping people in the first place.  We should rather set up taxes and social safety nets so that we make sure people are helped indiscriminately instead of at the whim of subjective and often discriminatory people: just look at how many idiots on Reddit think that lazy people exploiting the system is a big problem.  &gt;1) Exceeds the Scope of the Commerce Clause  It should be irrelevant what the original intent was pre-1937. If your little 200-year-old document doesn't get updated properly, it is about as useless as guidance for policies as a certain 2000-year-old book.  &gt;Threatens the Notion of Limited Government  Government is essential for many, many services, and health care is one of the most important ones. It is about time the US joined the rest of the developed world with Universal Health Care, and the PPACA is at least better than what you had.  &gt;3) Imperils Religious Liberty  No one cares what they subjectively believe. The rules apply to everyone whether they worship Yahweh, Santa Clause, or the invisible hand™.  &gt;4) Rewrites Contract Law  It doesn't matter. It is an absolutely necessary part of the system, and the only people that don't understand this are absolutists like libertarians, fundamentalists, etc. It shouldn't *be* a contract in the first place, it should be something provided for everyone. Health care is a right whether assholes without social responsibility like it or not.  &gt;5) Charges a Financial Penalty to Regulate Behavior / 6) Imposes an Unconstitutional Tax  Also necessary, although I personally think there must be some better ways to deal with that specific problem.  You, however, need to stop pretending health care isn't special in a lot of ways. It is an absolutely essential service that everyone needs, and if someone *doesn't* get health insurance they will be treated at the expense of all of us. Only sociopathic pieces of garbage would advocate letting people die, so the negative freedom to not have health care shouldn't exist. Ideology over reality is nonsense that most adults should have grown out of by the time they are in their 20s.  Furthermore, it is up to courts to decide whether it is constitutional or not, but, as I already said, it really should be pretty irrelevant what some 200-year-old document says if it isn't updated properly. We're almost in 2013 now, for crying out loud.  &gt;7) Erodes Federalism  So? Some states are shitty as hell and would do their best to fuck over the people. I have no problems with forcing states to not be shitty towards their populace when it comes to something as important as health care.  &gt;8) Infringes Upon the Reserved Powers of the States and the People....nowhere in the Constitution is Congress granted the power to compel the purchase of a product  It is completely irrelevant as health care is not and should not be a fucking *product.* It is an essential service whether you like it or not.  &gt;9) Neither Necessary nor Proper  See #1, but I agree with these:  &gt;Justice Ginsburg, joined by Justices Breyer, Sotomayor and Kagan, would have held that the individual mandate lay within Congress's Commerce Clause and Necessary and Proper Clause powers.  *****  Congress had a rational basis for concluding that the uninsured, as a class, substantially affect interstate commerce. Those without insurance consume billions of dollars of health-care products and services each year. Those goods are produced, sold, and delivered largely by national and regional companies who routinely transact business across state lines. The uninsured also cross state lines to receive care.   *****  &gt;10) It’s Not Just Unconstitutional...  Blah blah...libertarian axioms don't apply to the rest of us that have grown out of that phase.  Obamacare is by no means perfect, but it is much better than the garbage you had already. Hopefully it will be more politically viable to move to a Universal Health Care system once more of the Republicans start dying off and/or when you get some more progressive politicians in general on both sides.  In the meantime, you'll have to accept reality and make do with what you have.",™

Isn't it sort of like saying ""cat-dog"" or ""Plant-animal""?

If not, why can't I access all claims as being equally valid? What other characteristic(s) do I need to consider?  I would imagine that he can.  There just aren't many verses that could be construed to be supportive of homosexuality without some very strained logic.    One could argue from a number of ways as to which view is better supported by scripture though I'd say the most obvious one will come from appealing to the directness and abundance of passages in favor of one side over the other.  Moreover, the strength of the interpretation for the contrapositive should be weighed as well.  If the alleged pro-homosexuality verses are weak then they don't pose a very good defeater of the other verses.

t5_2rnve,Osirez,1356896396,"Here's the facts. Yes the i5 is better.  But... yes the 6300 will handle Skyrim and 90% of the games just fine.  You'll just be losing some of the overhead in performance most people like to have.  Meaning you may notice some stutter every once in awhile in a CPU intense game like Battlefield 3 multiplayer or starcraft. But the CPU bound games are a very small number.  The best reason I chose the 3470 over yours is because the one you have is aimed at enthusiast and is overclockable. Im sure your paying a premium for that and it's nowhere as strong as an i5.  If you want to stick with AMD tho its not that big of a deal. Just that the i5 is much better for gaming but your 6300 will work just fine on any game.  You will not need the 600 watt but it's better to have it. 500 watts will do just fine tho especially if your not overclocking.  Here's what AMDs own website says:   ""500W (or greater) power supply with one 75W 6-pin PCI Express power connector recommended 600W power supply (or greater) with four 75W 6-pin PCI Express power connectors recommended for AMD CrossFire™ technology.""  In English that means that a normal build shouldn't need more then 500 watts unless your running crossfire or doing abnormal things like overclocking.  For $10 more the 600 watt is a win.  Was trying to stay strictly within the budget you gave.  Add as many fans to the case as it will take. Wont hurt nothing. You can add the SSD anytime you want to.  Keep in mind tho if you add it later, you'll have to reinstall windows to it. For me no big deal. Depends on how you feel about going thru that tho. ",™

So imagine the following in Spong's velvety tenor:  &gt;So most theological God-talk is today meaningless.  &gt;&gt;Then why are you even talking?  He said ""most,"" not all.  He sees *theistic* theology as meaningless, but he's probably more open to atheistic theology (or Rollins' a/theology).  &gt;&gt;DAE Heresy?  I don't think he'd object to that.  &gt;&gt;Because God (who can do anything) can't plant a divine fertilized fetus in Mary.  You have a good point here.  You can't really use ""nobody can be born of a virgin"" as an argument against the virgin birth, since the whole point is that it's not an everyday occurrence.    &gt;&gt;DAE Deism?  I wouldn't say he's deistic, because deism implies an ontological, metaphysical God who, for whatever reason, doesn't interfere in reality.  Spong doesn't believe such a God exists at all.  ""Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you."" – Matthew 7:7 — Fuck the Bible, amirite?  Peter Rollins (I realize I have a huge mancrush on him) has a good way of looking at this that I think meshes well with Spong.  He writes that ""the asking *is* the giving, the seeking *is* the finding, the knocking *is* the opening.""  Basically, God's not a genie who grants wishes and manipulates reality based on our petitions, it's more of a change in the perception of reality that can be opened up by the very act of seeking it (Edit: [10]).

t5_2cneq,thinkB4Uact,1356919640,"There are three basic entities involved in business, employees, customers and owners.  There is a conflict of interests between these three entities.  Employees want higher pay, customers want higher quality and lower prices, owners want higher profits.  The left wing in politics aligns itself primarily with workers and secondarily with customers.  The right wing aligns itself with the owners.  Not that all of those that wear the cloth of the left and pay it lip service actually have the interests of the left in their hearts and minds.  Corruption knows no such political alignment, although when one's side works for the owners, one has a much easier time taking money from them to do for them what one didn't have a problem doing for them in the first place.    Just look at whose economic interests each side facilitates.  The right wants to keep taxes on high earners low, business regulations minimal, and wants restrictions on the rights of workers.  Regardless of the rampant corruption on the left, the left generally believes in worker rights, consumer protections and favors regulation on what business owners can do.  The split between the left and the right is the line between the forces of class conflict that goes back to the beginning of private property rights.  It goes back to when the first plot of land was owned and others were paid in food or other things to work the land to make goods.  Class conflict is just the competition over the gains from production between those that own the land/equipment/resources and those that work to make them into products and pay money for the products.  Owners can make themselves into kings by extracting value with the power of their ownership by paying the workers much less than the value of what they've created, making them into peasants as a consequence.    This conflict will not end as long as there are private property rights, no matter how hard we pretend there isn't a class conflict and try to sing Kumbaya with those that would benefit from us getting less for our work and paying more for what we made with our work.  The lure of power of extracting the value created by other people's work is so strong, many of us workers want to find a way to place ourselves in the same position so that we don't have to work as much.  Few owners find it in their hearts to share the bounty the workers created fairly with the workers, because that takes genuine altruism rather than the selfishness that helps one get into the position to profit off of the work of others in the first place, but such examples of amazing selflessness do exist.  The workers make substantially more at these places and are happier in general.  Our society is myopically focused on profit, when it is actually not the most important thing that drives economic prosperity.  Currency in the hands of those that toil to create goods and services is what allows people to demand goods and services.  Demand is what drives owners to hire more people and invest.  They lose potential profits by not hiring people to fill demand.  Unfortunately, in this country, the political forces of the owners have convinced many of the workers that businesses aren't hiring, because we're overtaxing the ""job creators™.""  It's a clever deception that serves the economic interests of owners, but owners do not hire people because they have more money.  They only hire people if they believe it will make them more money.  Maximizing profit compels owners to minimize wages, raise prices and lower quality (within what the market will allow).  The pressure toward increasing profits compels owners to take currency out of the hands of those that buy the things they have made at their jobs.  This hurts demand, as people remain wanting things their worker peers have made in the economy, but cannot afford them.  Without the demand owners don't hire new people.  Too much profitability can actually be a drain on the economy.  We shouldn't assume high profits for Wall Street will bring prosperity to all, we should keep in mind the economic relationship those owner profits have to the workers' and customers' economic interests.",™

t5_2qh61,mollyfied,1356924192,"Okay. **** This isn't what you expected, but that doesn't matter now. What _does_ matter is the taste of the bulbous head of her cock sliding down your throat: mild, with a slight tang, and the milky aftertaste of her cream. It's huge -- almost too big to even swallow. But a few persistent thrusts results in a massive tightening in your throat. You had no idea she was hiding this _monster_ of a member under that smooth dress. What you expected was a tight, firm little slit -- but that doesn't matter now.  What matters is feeling the rich fullness slide over your tongue, against your teeth, down your throat. What matters are the butterflies in your stomach that you could almost swear were conspiring against you, forcing you to be unable to hold still as that warm space between her legs repeatedly chokes your vision. You're surrounded by her delicate scent. It's a miasma of pent-up frustration and smooth longing. It screams her, and your mind starts to go a little fuzzy as your losing your breath, before it happens.  She gasps, jerks, stiffens -- she's coming, and you can barely believe that this is happening to you. Her rich taste is overwhelming not just your taste buds, but those little unexplainable senses at the core of your being... those same senses that told you to ask her out in the first place. You wish you could contain it all, but it's overflowing now, rushing up against your wishes and exploding out of your mouth, just as she exploded into you.  You cough and gag. There's just _so_ much. It feels like a waste to be so inadequate as to not swallow all of the delicious spunk she's saved up, just for you. You briefly contemplate leaning down to lick the excess from her feet, her calves, the floor even... but she draws her fingers under your chin, lifting it, and kisses you.  She's grinning. You taste like her. You're marked. Excellent. Through the smile, she maintains her grip on her lips, sucking the remains of herself from your mouth. It's such an unexpected motion, so sensual and full of feeling, that you almost want to cry.  But there's no time for that, of course -- ain't nobody got time for that. Before the hypoxia haze clears fully, she's pushed you to the ground again, straddling your waist, leaving a slick trail of cum all over your stomach. She's saying something, but all you can focus on is the feel of her warm, heavy breasts on your own, and something hot and smooth impatiently maneuvering between them...  It's her cock. It's long enough to fit through your cleavage, and her own, as she bends over to force it into your midst. But it's not really forcing, is it? Not when you're both so sweaty and aroused that the motions are wet and easy. It's more that the loss of control is... humiliating. It's forces you to acknowledge her superiority. You can't help but feel helpless as she starts to slowly grind through your paired breasts, her breath catching on every thrust, her abs rippling smoothly with the effort under a sheen of juices. She looks so freaking amazing in her power. You can't help but start to writhe in anticipation of her next load.  You never expected this. But then again, you didn't want to. The surprise is part of the thrill. The sex? That's the rest.  Because it _is_ thrilling, isn't? That she's shooting her jizz all over your face yet again, and you can't even squirm away if you wanted to -- and you don't. Not anymore. In fact, you're delighted that she still has more to give (where does it come from?) and she's willing. She's sharing her gift with _you_, all because she thinks you're worthy. And that's a concept that hasn't crossed your mind before -- which is great, because her cum is certainly crossing your face. It's delicious.  Before you can even raise your hands to gather the inevitable excess and eagerly push it your mouth, she turns you over (being manhandled by this woman is exquisite) and leans her head next to yours. She's still hard, and you can feel that hardness between your cheeks, but she's finally laying still. Could it be that she's spent? Is this the end? Is the maelstrom of passionate bliss mercifully going to end?  Oh, _hell_ no. She's simply letting you rest a bit before her next act. Just a bit. Because if you knew what would happen next, you'd seize up, and be in a world of pain. After all, you've never had anal, have you? She whispers into your ear, smoothly, sweetly, ""I'm going to rape you.""  For just a moment, you seize up anyway, because of the word ""rape,"" and all the connotations it bears. But the silkiness of her words relax you, and you're ready to do anything for this vixen with a vice. Anything. Even lose your anal virginity.  It's over in a moment. She thrusts into you, and phosphenes of pain dance across your vision. It hurts. I mean, it really, _really_ hurts. She's so huge! If you knew she planned to fuck your ass from the beginning, you would have glanced at the door, if not bolt to it.  But aren't you glad you didn't? Because despite what you've read on Reddit, asked on Yahoo! Answers, Googled in Incognito, viewed on Bing Video, you've always been intrigued by the idea of anal sex. You've never let your boyfriends go through with it, and your girlfriend has never had a thing for strap-ons (even double-sided ones), but deep down, you've wondered how it would feel to have a rich, thick dick slam your bum from behind as if you're nothing more than a common whore, eager to do the raunchiest of acts for a dead president or two. It's so sick, so perverse -- you poop from there, of course! But, no, wait, _because_ of that, it's something you've secretly wished to try. It's a secret you've kept hidden from your closest lovers... even from yourself.  And against your conscious will, that secret is being pulled to the top of your psyche with every ramming thrust of her hips. It's like a piston drawing water to the surface of the well, siphoning your resistance away until your left with nothing but pleasure and the _exquisite_ sense of fullness. It's breathtaking.   You're blushing. She notices. You think you hear something like, ""I'm thinking your cute,"" but she says it again, and they're probably the best words you've heard in your life: ""I'm... I'm going to cum!"" You can almost feel the ""♥"" in the statement, the hedonism in her actions. Fuck. She's so incredibly sexy, even when reaming your ass, quivering against it, squeezing your breasts, pressing her own against you, biting your ear, then tearing away, unable to even breathe as the torrent of ejaculate pulses through your bowels.  It's too much. The most you can do is scratch the ground, as if clawing for dear life. It's too much to take in. The entire situation, the madness of it all, the intoxication born from such vigor. You feel like you're going to sob.  Too late, you realize that choking knot in your chest isn't tears welling up. It's her jizz. It's found its way from your ass to your stomach... and beyond. You want to hold it in, to savor this undeniable proof of your bond. But, well, you just can't. You're inadequate. And with resignation, your cheeks bulge and your lips pout, but they can't hold the tide of cum at bay. It crashes through the gates of your mouth, exploding in a puddle in front of your face.  All of her tasty cum. Ruined.  You can feel her quaking above you; she's probably touching all over her skin, reveling in the afterglow. Lucky little lady. And you still haven't got your own release, have you? You've gotten so close, so many times, but she always shot first.  That's not going to happen again if you can help it. As she whimpers to herself, you rotate, quick, and give her a full five across her face. She's stunned, and falls back. She isn't knocked completely out, but you can tell she won't be moving for a while. She's not used to losing control like this.  You take your scarf and pull off a bit of improvisation you didn't know you ever had in you. And as you gaze at her delicate little wrists, splayed out on the ground, you know what you have to. You have to bind her. She's a minx. She'll probably wriggle out of the silk knot, but it will be enough for the moment.  She's starting to move when you finish tying her up. She's glaring at you, but the left corner of her mouth is pulling up into a grin; she isn't surprised often, and is wondering what you're trying to pull. She'll find out, won't she? Of course.  ""My turn.""",♥

I would say- this is kind of hard to explain- maintain Slugger's... mystique by keeping the shadows of your eyes deep, without looking like you're wearing a lot of makeup. Practice makes perfect.

Of course with low settings. Sure its not going to be running at 60fps but it can be made playable on lowest settings with some minor tweaks.  Torchlights system requirements states it needs a GMA 950 so you would be fine there.   Terraria requires almost nothing to run. ""128mb Video Memory, capable of Shader Model 1.1""  Audiosurf: 32 MB NVIDIA GeForce® 2. This is at least twice as fast.  Beat hazard might not run.  World of goo states that it needs ""Any 3D graphics accelerator less than 5 years old"" which was in 2008 when it released. That should be fine as well then.  The binding of issac should run but might lag. Same for super meat boy.

I covered the exit to the station that stops outside the city, as well as the portal itself with a wall to cut access to our city during the server emergency, in order to effectively initiate city lock-down. I removed 5-6 red brick blocks to make it resemble the nether road make-up. I still have them and once the nether roads are safe I will fix it myself just the way it was when we're no longer on lockdown.   The total alteration was the removal of less than 10 red bricks and covering it with a few netherrack blocks, and it is my responsibility to see it repaired when I think the danger passed. I decided to do it after public cities connected to the nether roads were randomly mass griefed as part of the war.

t5_2rfpj,TychoCelchuuu,1356990035,"Also, here's a SEMI-EXCLUSIVE REDDIT TIP™ because I forgot to mention this stuff in the video:  You have two other tools available to you as a commander - nanoshield and recycling. Nanoshield puts a little blue shield around whatever marine or building you use it on, which gives the unit much more resiliency for a short period of time. It's really helpful to use on phase gates that are under attack, resource extractors that you marines are en route to, and marines that you have a crush on.  Recycling destroys a building. It takes a little while, but at the end of the recycling period you will get some resources back (I'm not sure how it decides how many resources to give you). If you don't need a building you can recycle it, obviously, but this is also good because if you can recycle an extractor that you can't save, you'll get resources back from it as long as it recycles before the aliens kill it. This is also helpful for taking a phase gate out of the loop in the late game - sometimes it helps to cut down on the number of phases it takes to get to a hot location. You can even rebuild the phase gate later so the one in the old location is later down the phase chain, so to speak.",™
