t5_2qh2p,Dudesan,1335840203,"If you do this, you're going to get a lot of ""Durr, dat's the Old Testamunt, it don't count no more"".  Remember, many Christians find it more comfortable to believe in a god who doesn't condone, command or commit murder, slavery, rape, child abuse, animal abuse, arson, torture, ritual mutilation, fratricide, patricide, matricide, infanticide, genocide, and so on than to believe in one who does.  Unfortunately, since the Bible (Old Testamant and New) is pretty clear about Yahweh's position on these things, holding a belief in Loving Hippie Jesus‚Ñ¢ requires ignoring huge portions of it. Or just never reading it in the first place, which seems to be the most popular option.  Well, let's say what Jesus has to say about that:  &gt;‚ÄúDo not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished.  (Matthew 5:17-18, NIV)  Some Christians claim that his death and resurrection ""fulfill"" this. That is bullshit for one simple reason: last time I checked, Heaven and Earth haven't passed away.  Jesus also made his views on people ""picking and choosing"" quite clear:  &gt;[Jesus] answered them, ‚ÄúAnd why do you break God‚Äôs commandment because of your tradition? For God said:    *Honor your father and your mother;* and, *The one who speaks evil of father or mother must be put to death.*  &gt; But you say, ‚ÄòWhoever tells his father or mother, ‚ÄúWhatever benefit you might have received from me is a gift committed to the temple‚Äù‚Äî  he does not have to honor his father.‚Äô In this way, you have revoked God‚Äôs word because of your tradition. Hypocrites! Isaiah prophesied correctly about you when he said:    &gt;These people honor Me with their lips, but their heart is far from Me.  They worship Me in vain, teaching as doctrines the commands of men.‚Äù  (Matthew 15:3-9, NIV)   Looks like Jesus has quite a bit to say about people who ignore commandments, in fact. But maybe it's just Matthew?  &gt;It is easier for heaven and earth to disappear than for the least stroke of a pen to drop out of the Law.  (Luke 16:17, NIV)  Okay, so Jesus is a bust. Let's see what the Epistles have to say about the Mosaic Code:  &gt; If you really keep the royal law found in Scripture, ‚ÄúLove your neighbor as yourself,‚Äù you are doing right.  But if you show favoritism, you sin and are convicted by the law as lawbreakers. For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it.   (James 2:8-10, NIV)  &gt;All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness,  (2 Timothy 3:16)  &gt;Do we, then, nullify the law by this faith? Not at all! Rather, we uphold the law.  (Romans 3:31)  Well, shit.   This problem disappears quite quickly if you assert that most of the Bible is hogwash, and you only care about the good parts. If you prefer to cling to it as an inspired document, vague mutterings about ""context"" or about Jesus abolishing the old Law won't get you anywhere. ",‚Ñ¢

t5_2qh1i,WinningTheGame,1335848608,"First post ever, so forgive the lack of details and such.  This went down when I was in the 11th grade at my high school. This new, kinda weird chick was in my history class and sat in front of me. I went to a rather small school so everyone knows who everyone is somehow or another. We'd talk once in a while but that was it. One day while on Facebook I decided to creep on her profile and the first thing that stuck out to me was a link to a journal entry on ""deviantart"". I go to the link and it turns out to be a poem she wrote about her grandfather who had recently passed away, but I noticed there were a few other entries in her journal. As I looked through them, only because I had nothing better to do in my spare time, I came across one about a boy she went to school with. To my astonishment the damn post was about me.  Here's a bit of one of the posts I found. ( I ‚ô• ""WinningTheGame""! love Love LOVE!!! ohmygosh,, did he just look at me?! HE DID! ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooh! Hername &amp; ""WinningTheGame"" 4-ever! Gawd he's hot, I love his smile, 49 is my new lucky number 'cause that's ""WinningTheGame""s football number! Blue is the best color ever 'cause his eyes are blue!"") There were a few of these that quite honestly surprised, and sort of flattered me. Now that sounds like it's the creepy part. Nope! I decided since she would have no idea that I would have ever stumbled upon this journal that I should go ahead and comment on a few of her posts, and to reveal information about her that only someone who knew her would know, ie, hair color, real name, class's she was in. I thought nothing of this behavior at the time. She ended up super weirded out and asked me repeatedly in messages to tell her who I was, even offering to draw me a picture in return for an answer, but I averted these by simply not replying. Now that I look back on it, I feel rather bad for the girl. I was the real creep in this situation.   TL;DR  Found a ""slightly creepy"" post about me from classmate's Facebook page, then proceeded to creep her the fuck out by telling her I knew her and things about her.   EDIT: I just realized by creeping back through this that she probably had a really good idea who I was, seeing as I had used the numbers 49 in my username... She fucking knew I was being a creep. &gt;.&gt;",‚ô•

If you had sex, you had kids, period. Sometimes that meant you had a lot of kids. Kids were put to work and helped out around the property or at the family company. Not having to make use of your children in some way that would be a financial asset to the family was something afforded only to the rich.  Birth control (among other things) came along and changed the game. Now people want to be their kids' friends instead of their parents. Everything is sacrificed in the name of the child. Some parents shun the concepts of discipline. For some reason, the baby boomers decided it'd be a great idea to ""give [their] kids everything [they] never had,‚Ñ¢"" which is a terrible idea if you think about it.   Kids as young as six are bought iPhones. More than ever, parents seem to throw around the excuse of, ""But if I don't give Bratley x, he won't listen to me!""

Except, Shasta was cheaper. I'm talking $2 for a flat of 24.  My friends and I enjoyed the finer things in life. We were in high school, and were of the group I can now comfortably refer to as ""the religious weirdos."" We were good kids because we were either scared of our parents, scared of our peers' judgement (one was a preacher's son), or scared of the almighty wrath of GOD. But everyone needs an outlet.  For my eighteenth birthday, we threw a rager (as I defined it at the time) in my parents' back yard. Couches on the lawn, 40 kids around drinking from Red Solo cups, kids on fire (my buddy tried to imitate charmander using lighter fluid. Then, there were Shasta bongs. And we were good at it.   We moved on from that to one last party of the year. We brought a horse trough. We brought the couches again. We had a band, inflatable mechanical bull ride, and the Mayor. I did a shasta bong (beer bong with shasta) with the Mayor - and kicked his ass, too. We were rolling kids down the garage ramp in trash cans. My recollection of the night is actually kind of spotty... But the truth is, everything in the cups was completely legal for teenagers. It was awesome. ",¬Æ

They're also competing for two wildcard spots, and the competition for those spots will not be balanced.  That is a valid point, however what I think baseball should do is have every team play one series against each team in the other league.  But most people wouldn't go for that.  I honestly think it's not that big a deal.  Strength of schedule over 162 games is only minutely different when the difference is 3 - 4 series.  Plus even if there was no interleague, there would be the same problem with playing a different schedule within your own division.

t5_2r0y3,terqui,1335893767,"Yes, I have r/chronicpain subbed. Ive tried a lot of shit that hasnt worked. Ive been dealing with this condition for probably more than 4 years now. Chronic pain was a major factor in my opiate abuse, which was what I told my doctor. When he asked what types of opioids I abused, I told him mainly OxyContin because I could eat them and have all day pain relief.  At my last appointment with him, which was nearly a year ago (on my birthday actually), I was open and told him I was on subs. He said, and I quote, ""Well just because youre on Suboxone‚Ñ¢ now, doesnt mean you cant be prescribed narcotics in the future."" So I kinda figured he'd be the most willing doctor to prescribe me something good. I went back to him a year later. The fact that I had done a year of doctor instructed ""first line"" pain relief (NSAID &amp; swimming) to no avail, had documentation, a diagnosis from a doctor and colleague of my current Dr., and had been off subs for 5 months, gave him enough confidence in the fact that I could safely be prescribed narcotics. He chose methadone because of its relatively low abuse profile when compared to other full agonists, long duration, and analgesic potency.  So guys heres a quick and easy guide on how to get opiates from your doctor if youre a junky: Most importantly, have health insurance. Then, endure years of a documented chronic pain condition. Get lucky with a liberal, understanding doctor. Do a year off bullshit exercises and take various NSAIDS. Finally, be able to eloquently twist around your past use to look like pain relief instead of abuse. Viola! You can now start the long journey of trying to get an unnecessary amount of pills for your condition.   It's so simple guys! I seriously dont understand how all dont have your own scripts by now.",‚Ñ¢

t5_2qh13,arte_misia,1335900264,"You are thinking about the Icesave dispute and the two referendums. This dispute is between the Icelandic gov and the governments of the UK and the Netherlands.    It is about the Icelandic State‚Äôs guarantee of repayments by the Depositors‚Äô and Investors‚Äô Guarantee Fund in Iceland to the UK and the Kingdom of the Netherlands. These repayments are in respect of costs incurred by the two states (UK and Dutch) when they paid deposit guarantees to the customers of Landsbanki Islands in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands.    Icesave was an online savings account brand owned and operated by the private Landsbanki  bank from 2006 to 2008. It operated in two countries ‚Äì the United Kingdom and the Netherlands.    On 6 October 2008, the Icelandic government pushed an emergency law through Iceland's parliament, the Althing, in response to the ""unusual financial market circumstances"".    In a separate measure, the government also guaranteed ""that deposits in domestic commercial and savings banks and their branches in Iceland will be fully covered."" The FME, Financial Supervisory Authority, placed Landsbanki in receivership early on 7 October.    A press release from the FME stated that all ""domestic deposits"" were fully guaranteed.   On 8 October, the UK the Treasury went on to freeze the assets of Landsbanki and assets belonging to the Central Bank of Iceland, and the Government of Iceland relating to Landsbanki.  The arguments of the British and Dutch governments are based on their interpretation of the law of the European Economic Area (EEA), and around two positions in particular:    ‚ñ™that the Icelandic government is obliged to guarantee at least the first ‚Ç¨20,000 in Icesave accounts;    ‚ñ™that Iceland's actions surrounding the collapse of Landsbanki are discriminatory against non-Icelandic creditors.    The Icelandic government disputes these positions.   An agreement was reached between UK, Netherlands and Icelandic negotiators, and a bill was presented to the Icelandic parliament in June 2009. Opponents of the bill argued that no clear legal obligation existed for Iceland to pay the lost deposits.    There was wide dissatisfaction with the new bill among the populace, and the president was petitioned by approximately 23 per cent of Iceland's voters, to put the issue before a referendum.    A referendum was held on 6 March 2010 where the proposed bill was defeated, with 93 per cent voting against and less than 2 per cent in favor.     After the referendum, new negotiations commenced. On 16 February 2011 the Icelandic parliament agreed to a repayment deal to pay back the full amount starting in 2016, finalizing before 2046, with a fixed interest rate of 3 per cent.   The bill provided for authorization to the Minister of Finance for state guarantees for reimbursement to the gov. of the UK and the Netherlands. Majority of voters were against granting this guarantee.     A referendum was held on April 9 2011, the deal was rejected, 39.7 per cent of voters voted in favor of the agreement, while 58.9 per cent voted against it.     The case will now be brought before the EFTA Court.  If the EFTA Court finds that there is a breach, Iceland will be required to take immediate actions to comply with that judgment.    TL;DR The debt of a private bank should be paid by that bank. Not the citizens of the country where that bank was located.",‚ñ™

Ironically neither of us knew that the other had been thinking of the same thing. One day Jordan called me up and pitched the idea, I was ecstatic and explained that I had been wanting to do the same thing! We each had mediocre plans in our heads but once we got together and began to brainstorm it quickly bloomed into a very realistic and achievable dream.   &gt;We knew our first attempt was going to be more of a learning experience than a realistic ""underwater room"". It consisted of a net tied to large rocks with climbing webbing, we put a piece of plastic under the net and let a large bubble into it with a SCUBA tank. As proof of concept it was great but it was far from realistic. The biggest problem was that it was unstable and all of the force was focused on the four corners of the net. We were able to swim around it and ""feel"" it and see where the stresses were and how to improve it.   &gt;Over the course of the next several weeks we did lots of math and research, drawings and scale models. We are now on ""version 3"" which is by far the best and most user friendly design so far.""  [Source](http://subaqua.alldaydrive.com/history.php)",¬Æ

Prior to digitisation by the ADC, the signal needs to be adjusted to match the full scale input range of the ADC. This is required to maximise the dynamic range of the signal at the ADC input and reduce the burden on the digital demodulator. The output AGC has a number of modes that provide the user with the maximum degree of flexibility. The AGC can be run fully autonomously, with the user selecting from a number of preprogrammed options. Alternatively, the AGC can be integrated into a baseband processor control loop.""  Question is, how do you select the option, and is there a disable option. Setting in the EPROM?   -edit-  never mind, its in the driver.  ",‚Ñ¢

t5_2r05i,MrSmite,1335996746,"Well, of course it's preaching to the converted, but it's discussions like this that can be especially illuminating to people on the outside looking in! I'm glad you took the time to respond at length!  To illustrate: Watching back-and-forth discussions among users of a distribution you *don't* use can be laced with useful tidbits. Or, sometimes such discussions might just be enough of a push to someone who hasn't tried Linux (or ${distribution}) to give it a whirl! A good debate can be fun, but so can a good, friendly discussion that focuses more on common ground and agreement than on disputes.  I do have to vocally include my agreement and further evangelism of the utility expressed by package managers, regardless of the distro. It's difficult to explain to someone who might be coming from a Windows background, because Windows users are typically conditioned to download apps and install them (though some claim the Windows 8 app store will fix this--I disagree mostly on the premise that app stores create a walled garden with greater restrictions than package managers!). However, the *ease of use* one finds with a package manager is something you have to experience to fully appreciate. Better yet: Since most major distributions have package managers that will accept 3rd party packages, being unable to find it in the default repositories doesn't really mean much--if you can find another repository or a download, the package manager will pull in any dependencies automatically.  Of course, there are sharp edges. For rolling-release distributions or source distributions like Gentoo or Arch, it's possible to run into circumstances where a package doesn't build or requires newer versions of system libraries to run, but it's nothing that can't be fixed. The same goes, more or less, for FreeBSD's ports collection. But, again, I can't agree with Helzibah enough: It's a completely different world that makes using an OS *fun*.  &gt; The other thing that always jumps to my mind is that for an operating system called Windows, its window management is shockingly limited  I'm glad you brought this up, because it's something I completely forgot about. Perhaps it's because it's something so useful and so natural (I'm talking about modern window managers for X, that is, to anyone who might be wonder) that you hardly give it a second thought. Virtual desktops (real ones, not the half-assed implementations in Windows) are handy if you tend to have a lot of apps running, and virtually all window managers give you neat little tools like sticky windows, moving windows across desktops with a couple of clicks, or configuring a window's behavior (transparency, position, etc). I do use Windows occasionally, and as you mentioned, Windows 7 has improved a lot of things (I like the taskbar changes the best, once I got used to them), there are little odds and ends that I think would really make it shiny if MS would focus on implementing them. Sure, there's 3rd party tools--I use DisplayFusion for dual monitor management, for instance, and other little goodies--but having it *built in* to the UI from the software vendor is a far better option. Like with KDE: I didn't need to add anything to have another taskbar panel on my second monitor--I just add one. No 3rd party software needed. Maybe Microsoft doesn't want to harm the addon vendor ecosystem? Who knows.  One last bit: I hope you haven't seen attempted rebuttals! One thing I've noticed about /r/Minecraft (and maybe Reddit in general) is that *most* people seem friendlier toward others' choice of OSes. This is in contrast with Slashdot where, when the moon turns red, the Windows zealots come out in full force. Perhaps it's driven by jealousy, but some of the discussions I've witnessed have been pretty emotional.  I should emphasize something else, as well, before I close. I don't mean any of this to force my choice of OS on anyone who might be reading through this thread. If you prefer Windows, OS X, OS/2, or whatever--that's fine. I don't care, as long as you enjoy what you're using, and you find that it suits your particular needs well. My point, and that of Helzibah I'm sure, is that we *like* to use Linux because we can Get Work Done‚Ñ¢. It's fun, we enjoy it, and we enjoy *talking* about the reasons why we find it so enjoyable. Of course, I'd love it if more people used Linux or at least experienced it so they could make their own educated decisions, but it's something that requires a non-trivial time investment. Not everyone will share our same experiences, and that's perfectly fine!",‚Ñ¢

t5_2tcpq,SashimiX,1336073403,"If anyone is curious, I took time to write this out to explain some of the contradictions from a Christian's point of view [awhile back](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/du226/frontpage_uganda_newspaper_story_featured_a_list/c12yb18):  &gt; This is very long, but I will explain abrogation from an evangelical's perspective if you are interested.  &gt; First of all, I think every single part of the Bible is bullshit. That said, there is no reason why Christians have to choose the whole Bible or none of it.  &gt; [Someone](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/d96an/reason_claims_another_victory_institute_for/c0yibk8) said to me on reddit:   &gt; &gt; Except it is logical to take the book at its word. What's not logical is what Christians do all the time: Treat some passages literally (e.g., the ban on homosexuality), others figuratively (e.g., if your eye offends you, rip it out), and completely ignore the rest (e.g., the ban on wearing clothing made from two kinds of cloth).  &gt; Take any work of literature. Some parts are literal, other words in the same work are sarcastic; sometimes metaphors are thrown in. Sometimes the same author has a work of poetry and a compilation of essays and a compilation of popular axioms.  &gt; Read this from PZ Meyers:  &gt;&gt; here is a wonderful program in place at a bible camp in Massachusetts: the children get phone calls‚Ä¶from God. He tells the kids to proselytize for him, to be just like Jesus, and if they're really, really good, that he'll swoop in some day on his magic sleigh and harvest their souls to bring to heaven with him (OK, that last bit is an extrapolation). I like this plan, though. It sets the kids up with concrete expectations that will be shattered later, and then there's always the wonderful day when Mommy and Daddy explain that that really wasn't God, it was just Pastor Greg pretending to be the voice of God, just like he does every Sunday. This program is so good that it has won Atheist Ireland's really, truly True Believer‚Ñ¢ of the month award.  &gt; Do you think he really believes the program is good and wonderful? Do you think he literally means they teach that Jesus will swoop in on a magic sleigh? He admits it is an extrapolation, but is that really what it is, or is it hyperbole and sarcasm? Should we assume he is stupid because he doesn't even know what extrapolation means?  &gt; The part about ""if your eye offends you"" is obviously hyperbole in the same way. The ban on homosexuality is quite literal, not figurative, and is found in both the old and new testaments (another reason to hate the Bible). And the ban on wearing clothing is in a set of laws that Christians believe for various reasons--and some of them make sense--no longer apply.  &gt; OK, how can you believe one law in Leviticus is to be ignored while another should be the basis for ruining someone's life?  &gt; a. I do not believe any laws in Leviticus should be the basis for ruining anybody's life. I hold more stock in the Grimm's Fairy Tales than I do in the Bible.  &gt; b. The law about homosexuality is repeated in the New Testament, whereas many of the other laws are explicitly repealed in the New Testament.  &gt; Here is a repeat of the law about homosexuality. In this case, it makes it clear that God feels it is unnatural. This one even lists lesbians:  &gt;&gt; Romans 1:26-27 (King James Version)  &gt;&gt; 26 For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:  &gt;&gt; 27 And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet.  &gt; To the majority of American Christians who say they take the entire Bible literally, the New Testament has the final say. They openly acknowledge that the new and old testaments contradict each other; they claim that when Jesus came he erased much of the old law. Think of it as a Deus Ex Machina plot device; not great writing, but we don't say the ending contradicts the beginning.  &gt; The New Testament also acknowledges that it contradicts the Old. Take this verse, in which Jesus addresses the OT policy of ""eye for eye, tooth for tooth, life for life"" which made punishment equal to the crime. If a man gouged out your eye, the law gave you the ability to, after a trial, gouge out his. Jesus explains he is bringing in a new set of rules:  &gt;&gt; Matthew 5:38-42 (King James Version)  &gt;&gt; 38 Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth:  &gt;&gt; 39 But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also.  &gt;&gt; 40 And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also.  &gt;&gt; 41 And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain.  &gt;&gt; 42 Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away.  &gt; There are numerous other places that the law is changed while the old laws are explicitly recognized. Basically, the idea is that Jesus ""covered"" much of the law from the Old Testament. Circumcision, eating shellfish, eating meat sacrificed to pagan Gods ... all of these things were explicitly negated.  &gt; Sure, some laws were not. For example, one of the Ten Commandments is observe the Sabbath (which is from dusk on Friday til dusk on Saturday). The same Christians who take the Bible literally say they revere the Ten Commandments yet they observe the Sabbath on Sunday.  &gt; How do they get away with this? They have a complicated theology from the Bible that involves being freed from the OT law. Some of that theology is detailed  [here](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%207-8&amp;version=NASB). It explains that, if you try to follow the old law, you are bound by it. But if you accept Jesus' sacrifice, you are no longer bound to it. If you are interested in understanding this theology further, I would be happy to explain it.  &gt; I still believe that they pick and choose too freely. I believe that if you use this verse to apply to the Sabbath, it should also be used on ANY OTHER RULE that is not replicated in the new testament, and I don't believe they are consistent in this regard. That's why I said only SOME of their reasons make sense.",‚Ñ¢

t5_2qh38,paranoidelephpant,1336135739,"&gt; So if you had been storing passwords in say, 5.3.6, and you upgraded to PHP 5.3.11, your old password hashes using $2a$ would not work.  That's incorrect. Your hashes will continue to work just fine in most cases. There was a (long-known) bug in crypt &lt;= 1.0 which incorrectly handled 8-bit characters. Standard ASCII characters between 0-127 are 7-bit. Characters in the extended table (128 - 255) are 8-bit. The bcrypt algorithm wasn't processing 8-bit characters correctly, so that an internal variable was wrapping.  Crypt 1.1 fixed the issue, and crypt 1.2 introduced the new identifiers. `2a` was changed to correctly handle 8-bit characters, and has a ""safety bit"" to try to determine if it should use compatible behavior or not. `2x` was introduced to force the old behavior, so if administrators have problems with old hashes and users with 8-bit character passwords they can flip the hash identifiers until they migrate. And finally, `2y` was introduced to work exactly like `2a` without the safety bit.  It's perfectly safe to continue to use `2a`, but new projects should use `2y`. Administrators should try to migrate their hashes if they can, of course.  Here's an example of the hashes in action to show what I mean:      // Force the buggy behavior with an 8-bit character     php &gt; echo crypt('passwo¬Æd', '$2x$08$saltSALTsaltSALTsaltSA');     $2x$08$saltSALTsaltSALTsaltS.vn.k10Jng0Ss6klyD.aC3j0rJJcvGiy          // Use the new unbugged 2y identifier with an 8-bit character     php &gt; echo crypt('passwo¬Æd', '$2y$08$saltSALTsaltSALTsaltSA');     $2y$08$saltSALTsaltSALTsaltS.hcP.KrwDV9EVIurhmH2MsKp7VPLfjDq          // 2a works like 2y in PHP &gt;= 5.3.7, and like 2x in PHP &lt; 5.3.7     php &gt; echo crypt('passwo¬Æd', '$2a$08$saltSALTsaltSALTsaltSA');     $2a$08$saltSALTsaltSALTsaltS.hcP.KrwDV9EVIurhmH2MsKp7VPLfjDq  So you'll only run into problems if any of your users use characters from the extended ASCII table, which is extremely rare.",¬Æ

Let's break it down further:   &gt; A) Not everyone in this subreddit are US Americans  This is literally the only semi-valid point you make, and then you cling to it despite it really only being somewhat relevant. Sure, not everyone in this subreddit is based in the US, but most important thing is that they have the skills you're asking for (JS-savvy, comfortable with HTML5, etc) and if they do I CAN GUARANTEE YOU THEY'RE WORTH MORE THAN $9 PRETAX (what you've posted as your going offer) NO MATTER WHERE THEY LIVE.   &gt;  B&amp;C)  Let's make this very clear for you: The value of a software developer (or any worker, but definitely a software developer) is not *IN ANY WAY* tied to your income. What other people are making in their completely unrelated jobs is entirely irrelevant to what a freelancer charges as their going rate.   &gt; That being said, there are literally dozens of posts I see all over reddit...  There's a homeless guy on the street begging for change; should I write an app in exchange for a Subway‚Ñ¢ sandwich because you think that's somehow relevant to a freelance business relationship?   &gt; Are you so morally and monetary objective that you can deem other posts and people irrelevant? Are you so full of yourself that you post up the minimum wage of the US as to show me what a dick I am that I'm willing to pay only what I am able to pay?  Wait, wait. You post completely lowball offers expecting workers to accept your disgustingly low rate that's been offered solely based on your ability to pay with absolutely no respect given to the livelihood or skills of the individuals you're looking for and somehow we're the selfish ones? Hah!  &gt; You are not only offending people like me, time and time again, over and over again, but you are causing the people who look for jobs like the ones I publish to find this subreddit irrelevant, because my kind of posts are dowvoted despite [1] these kind of talks we had before.  Good riddance.   tl;dr: In most cases I consider it inappropriate to meddle in business dealings between other freelancers and their clients. On a personal level, I always try to offer a reddit discount and help my clients here stick within their budgets. But OP's opinion is so self-centered while his rate is so offensively low that I applaud the other freelancers who have called him out on his bullshit. ",‚Ñ¢

t5_2qxih,dulfy,1336166384,"05.04.2012 In celebration of ‚ÄúMay the 4th be with you‚Äù we‚Äôve decided to create a special Fan Friday. For Star Wars‚Ñ¢ Day, we are highlighting some of the most creative and talented members of our community by showcasing them in our Community Blog!  This week we have a community member spotlight, new forum emoticons, and to begin with, some amazing fan art.  **Community Art Spotlight**   Community member Eppywon decided to show off his Trooper, Caeric, by creating the incredible artwork above.   Spartanash shows off their amazing artistic skills with the two pieces above: to the left, Raven Klusto, a Bounty Hunter Powertech and on the right, Alexandria Snow, a Smuggler Gunslinger.   RanvirBorealas depicts his in-game character, Korwyn Roxton (a Vanguard Trooper), in the extraordinary and stylish piece of art above.  **Community Member Spotlight**  Iwipe (AKA Dulfy)   Iwipe, who also uses the handle ‚ÄòDulfy‚Äô away from our Forums, has been an incredible asset to our community since she joined in August 2011. She has created several forum guides including: the Operation Loot Drop List, the 1.2 Dailies and PvE Gearing Guide, the Hardmode Flashpoint Loot List, and the Companion Customizations Guide.  Most recently, she helped out tons of players with her popular Rakghoul Outbreak Guide, providing the latest information on missions and rewards as they were revealed. We thought she‚Äôd be a great fan to talk to for the relaunch of Fan Friday.  **BioWare: How did you first get into Star Wars‚Ñ¢: The Old Republic‚Ñ¢?**  Dulfy: I first heard about Star Wars: The Old Republic while playing another MMO during the fall of 2011 via word of mouth. The combination of Star Wars, BioWare, storytelling, and MMO really perked my interest and I pre-ordered right away! I was lucky enough to get invited to a few weekend tests and immensely enjoyed my time there. When December rolled around, my entire guild decided to migrate over to The Old Republic and I have been playing since pre-launch.  **What made you want to provide so much info for the community?**  Forums are a great source of information but it takes time to dig through and find relevant info so I started writing guides and such to help the community out. I spend a little bit of my free time gathering that information and compiling it together in an easy to read format so that people can focus more of their free time on playing the game.  **What‚Äôs your process usually like for putting a guide together? How long does it take you?**  I go through a checklist with every guide:  What is needed?  Did someone already do an excellent coverage of it?  Find the facts.  Verify the facts.  Take in-game screenshots, videos etc.  Write the guide.  Publish it and listen to community feedback ‚Äì if there is anything they don‚Äôt like or if they find something wrong I will go and correct/change it.  Simple guides like a Flashpoint guide takes maybe 2-3 days while other guides like the Sorcerer/Sage healing guide or PvE endgame gearing take weeks or even months to finish because it takes time to get a good grasp of the game mechanics.  **What class do you enjoy playing the most and why?**  I have this strange obsession with playing healer classes and only healer classes. I guess I like the idea of healers helping other people and save them in time of need! I have a level 50 Sorcerer and a level 50 Commando at the moment and planning to level up an Operative so I can have all the healer classes available in the game.  **What are you looking forward to the most in The Old Republic?**  Oh quite a lot! I am a progression raider at heart so I always look forward to new Operations and Flashpoints to conquer. Also, after the Rakghoul dynamic event, I can‚Äôt wait for another event! The scavenger hunt, daily quest unlocks, world PvP, and solidarity in the community via the spread of Rakghoul Plague made this event stand out. Lastly, I am a big a fan of vanity things like outfits, pets, and mounts. I personally cannot wait for new outfits and the ability to add augment slots to existing armor.  **Which guide that you‚Äôve created do you think is the most useful for new players?**  I think that would be 1.2 Dailies and PvE Gearing guide I created that is now pinned in the Flashpoint &amp; Operation section of the Forums (big thank you to the wonderful Community Representatives). I feel like the leveling experience is fairly smooth and most people can get to 50 without much outside guidance.  **Forum Emoticons (Smilies)** Ah yes, emoticons are back! Enjoy this new batch of Rakghoul emoticons to use on our Forums. This new set highlights the Rakghouls, the deformed mutants responsible for the recent Rakghoul Plague outbreak on Tatooine.   To use one of these or any other forum emoticons, click ‚ÄúMore‚Äù in the Smilies section on the right side of where you make a new post. From there, simply decide which icon you want to use and click it to put it in your post.   ",‚Ñ¢

This is a very simplistic take on the subject, unfortunately ‚Äî that or it screams cherry-picking.   I absolutely will *not* get into a back and forth with you, but here's a few tidbits.  1. ~~Money for People‚Ñ¢~~ [Words for Humans.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_neutrality_in_English#Words_for_humans)  1. [Feminist philosophy of language](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-language/). Here's the first section of the first part (I recommend the entire first part):  &gt;**False gender-neutrality**  &gt;There has been a great deal of feminist concern over the supposedly gender-neutral use of terms like ‚Äòhe‚Äô and ‚Äòman‚Äô. It is commonly said that these terms have both gender-specific meanings, as in sentences (1) and (2), and gender-neutral ones, as in sentences (3) and (4).  &gt;1. He drank the wine. 1. A man went into a bar. 1. When a student comes into the room, he should pick up a handout. 1. Man is a primate.  &gt;Feminists, however, have pointed out that even the supposed gender-neutral meanings of these terms are not really gender-neutral. Janice Moulton (1981a) and Adele Mercier (1995) provide examples in which there is no doubt that a gender-neutral meaning is intended, but this meaning seems unavailable. As a result, the sentences seem ill-formed:  &gt;5) Man has two sexes; some men are female.  &gt;6) Man breastfeeds his young.  &gt;7) Ask the candidate about his husband or wife.  &gt;We are, then, making a classificatory error if we claim that ‚Äòman‚Äô and ‚Äòhe‚Äô are gender-neutral terms. In order to avoid such a classificatory error, we need to do more careful work on what the meanings of these terms actually are. Perhaps the meaning of ‚Äòhe‚Äô that has been called ‚Äògender-neutral‚Äô is not really gender-neutral, but something much more complex. Mercier suggests, for example, that we should understand the ‚Äògender-neutral‚Äô use of ‚Äòman‚Äô as referring to either (a) a person or persons of unknown sex; or (b) males or a combination of males and females. This explains why ‚Äòmen‚Äô in (5) and ‚Äòman‚Äô in (6) are anomalous: these terms are being used to refer exclusively to persons known to be female.  &gt;The supposed ‚Äògender-neutral‚Äô meaning of these terms, then, is not truly gender neutral. But, on its own, this does not show that there is a problem with those uses that have traditionally been classified as gender-neutral, as in sentences (3) and (4). (Discovering that we have misclassified an adjective as an adverb would not show anything wrong with actual uses of the term in question.) Further reasons are needed in order to object to the use that is made of these terms. ",‚Ñ¢

No matter what my gender identity is, I like to allow people to see me as they want to see me. No less, no more.  **Gender is not a dichotomy.**  I cannot tell you for sure if you are trans or not. I cannot tell you which actions are appropriate for you. I am not you. However, I can share my own thoughts, feelings, and experiences with you. I can also certainly tell you that you are not alone in being confused.  Unfortunately, nopony, trans nor cis, can tell you what is right for you. This is something you have to discover for yourself. However, you do not have to discover it alone. There are many others out there, self included, willing to support you and your choices no matter what they are.  Try not to be afraid. I know that gender identity is confusing and scary. I also know that a lot of cis people really don't understand. In fact, a lot of trans people do not understand either. It's not always as simple as ""you are or you aren't"".  I personally think that you would not have made this post if this was not something you felt seriously about. I don't think you would have thought twice about it if you honestly and truly thought that you only wanted to ""be different"" as you said. However, again, I am not you, and I cannot speak for you.  If you ever need somepony to talk to, you are more than welcome to message me. From there, we can also get together over instant messages or something if you would like. ‚ô•  (For this post, cis- and trans- are used with their most basic definitions in mind.

'Almost the entire post is about that...And it gets stated multiple times,  Let me quote the numerous times it's stated, which makes up nearly my entire post: ""How can we stop people from messaging sponsors like this? First, I think we should start messaging the sponsors about how much of a MINORITY the complaints are that they receive from such things. We need to at least let them know that their continued sponsorship of our beloved players is important. We need to tell them how much we appreciate them sponsoring ANYONE, not how much we appreciate them having a hand in the removal of players. We need to explain what is happening in our community, if they do not already know----AND....AND I CAN NOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH----We need to do so intelligently...Not belligerent screaming, as I can only assume our ""assailants"" have done.""  ""If you think that messaging a sponsor because something offended you is HELPING this game out, you need to uninstall Starcraft II and never return to this board. You don't deserve the respect of anyone around you---You are not a knight, protecting some far-off castle from impending doom. You are a plague creeping into a society. ""  ""'Because, you see, as sponsors start to receive more and more messages like this; they are going to start to wonder why they should even be supporting this game we love so much.""  ""It's just a plea/rant---However you wish to take it...But I can't justify any means for which members of our community are messaging sponsors. No one , including myself, has to condone the things the players have done to receive these kinds of punishments, but you; as a fan of this game; have other means of communicating your negative feelings towards their actions. This is not one of them. Not like this, I do not want to see this community die off because of this rancid behavior.""  ""EDIT: I think I need to make this clear---I am not condoning the actions of Destiny or anyone...I am merely stating we need a better way to do this. If you're going to shit your brains out over one person, do it for all--And figure out a REASONABLE way to get things done. I feel like people are skimming over what I've said and taking away from it that I'm saying it's okay to say whatever you want. Please READ and ABSORB what is being said. I say it very clearly "" No one , including myself, has to condone the things the players have done to receive these kinds of punishments, but you; as a fan of this game; have other means of communicating your negative feelings towards their actions. "" )""  You're right. Something spoken about that many times couldn't ever possibly be the main point of the post. It's clearly a ruse to disguise my hidden racism, though I also state I do not agree with their actions.  I know reading comprehension is hard sometimes, but I am sure if you focus you'll get it.

Although it's in the Bible, it's in the Old Testament, and in Leviticus. I know some people on here will disagree with me and say I'm not a ""true Christian"" for saying this, but I don't follow what's written in Leviticus. Most of the Old Testament is made up of parables - things that didn't really happen, but are made for the meaning, like the morals in Aesop's Fables.   Because the Old Testament was written before Jesus came to us, it was written for the Jews of the time. Christianity is different. Jesus never said a word against homosexuals, and he said that he and God love everything and everyone unconditionally. He doesn't love one person more than another, especially because one is straight and one it gay, or bisexual.   All in all - yes, you can be a Christian without being straight.

t5_2snuc,lanemik,1336351766,"&gt;if you're under the impression that syllogistic arguments relying on metaphysical premises are evidence, then I agree with this sentiment. That would strike me as a rather peculiar definition.  According to the SEP, ""Evidence, whatever else it is, is the kind of thing which can make a difference to what one is justified in believing or (what is often, but not always, taken to be the same thing) what it is reasonable for one to believe."" In order for you to rationally believe that evidence must be something other than ""syllogistic arguments relying on metaphysical premises"" you'll need to find evidence to support that. However, what physical evidence could you possibly provide? None. That argument *itself* relies on syllogisms and metaphysics (henceforth called philosophy for simplicity). And if we cannot rely on philosophy, then any philosophical argument you make (including the philosophical argument that physical evidence is the only reasonable form of evidence) is irrational.   This is simply and example of the intellectual slovenliness of atheists to which I'm referring.  &gt; This is a bit of a straw man, no?  No, it *really* isn't. I've been told as much by diehards in here and in debate religion on far more than one occasion. What's more, there are people like Dawkins who said ""I often wonder what the point of having philosophers is"" and Hawking who insists that ""philosophy is dead."" These aren't qualified statements. These people are talking about *philosophy*.  &gt;It's just that the kind of Sophisticated Philosophy‚Ñ¢ that supports your newly adopted ""intelligent form of theism"" is, categorically, nothing more than linguistic circlejerkery.

Now back to elaborating on the plan for OP:  What you want to do is  find out the other taxpayer funded addiction non-profits in the area, get a copy of their budget, find out their costs for services and supplies - they have to make much of this info available.  Then you figure out how to do it cheaper. You can always do it cheaper, and if you don't want to go that route you need to find a way to demonstrate that you can more efficiently use the resources.  If some addiction services center is taking $200 000 a year from the municipality to do a needle change and hand out pamphlets, you write in your proposal that you can do it for $150 000 (and you probably can given the con-game that is the addiction industry) - and if you want the same amount of money, then figure out a way to show that you can help more people for the same amount of money.  You'll succeed, it's damn near impossible to fail at handing out needles to drug addicts. Then after you've got one addiction job under your belt, you move on to bigger fish and get into the addiction service industry - just like before: Figure out a way to do the same with less or more with the same and take it from there.  By then you'll have a reputation as a man who can get things done, and who does things efficiently; and in this game efficiency saves lives.   So wave those stats, glad those hands, stab those backs, climb that ladder and before you know it you'll be pulling in that $100K+ each year after taxes.

That's because they're really interested in a deterrent.  For the same reason, they don't want people to know that most of the testing kits currently available aren't particularly sensitive.  So, for example, the executive summary from the EU's Roadside Testing Assessment project:  The Rosita-2 project was carried out in 2003-2005 in order to evaluate the usability and analytical reliability of the onsite oral fluid (saliva) drug testing devices.  The study was carried out by National Institute for Criminalistics and Criminology in Brussels, Belgium, the National Public Health Institute in Helsinki, Finland, the Institute for Legal Medicine in Strasbourg, France, the Institute for Legal Medicine in Homburg/Saar, Germany, the Division of Forensic Toxicology and Drug Abuse, Norwegian Institute of Public Health, Oslo, Norway and Institute of Legal Medicine, University of Santiago de Compostela, Spain. It was coordinated by Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.  The study was performed in cooperation with the Unites States, where it is funded by The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), National Institutes of Health, US Department of Health and Human Services, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), US Department of Transportation and the Office of National Drug Control Policy Executive Office of the President. The US part is coordinated by The Walsh Group (Bethesda, Maryland). The study is carried out in the following states: Florida (Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office, Florida Department of Law Enforcement, Manatee County Sheriff's Office), Washington (Washington State Police, Washington State Toxicology Lab), Utah (Salt Lake City Police Department, Center for Human Toxicology) and Wisconsin (12 Police Jurisdictions, Wisconsin State Lab of Hygiene).  In the US, the study continues until the end of 2006. The complete results for the European part and the partial results of the US parts are presented here.  2046 Subjects were included in the study and 2605 device evaluations were performed. Nine devices were evaluated: American Biomedica Oralstat, Branan Medical Oratect, Cozart Bioscience RapiScan (only in the USA), Dr√§ger/Orasure DrugTest/Uplink, Lifepoint Impact, Securetec Drugwipe, Sun Biomedical Oraline, Ultimed Salivascreen and Varian OraLab.  The devices had tests for the following drugs: amphetamines, methamphetamine, cannabis, cocaine and opiates. Three devices also had a test for benzodiazepines.  During the study, two devices were withdrawn form the market: Dr√§ger/Orasure DrugTest/Uplink and Lifepoint Impact.  Subjects for whom a suspicion of driving under the influence of drugs existed were asked to participate in the study on a voluntary basis. In most cases the following samples were taken: a blood sample and an oral fluid sample with the Intercept‚Ñ¢ sampler for analysis in the lab with reference techniques (gas or liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry, sometimes after screening with an immunoassay), and one (or two) oral fluid sample for analysis with the onsite device.  For some devices, a very high percentage of failures was observed. Depending on the type of device, this was apparently due to too little or too viscous saliva (the fluid didn't migrate until the control line, or it caused smears), or to a malfunctioning of the instrument that read the results. For six devices (Varian Oralab, Lifepoint Impact, Branan Oratect 2nd generation, Sun Oraline, Ultimed Salivascreen and Branan Oratect 1st generation), more than 25% of the devices failed to run. For the other devices, the number of failures was less than 10 % (American Biomedica Oralstat and Dr√§ger DrugTest/Orasure Uplink) or less than 5% (Cozart Rapiscan and Securetec Drugwipe). The evaluators considered that a failure rate of maximum 5-10% was acceptable.  The number of evaluations per device varied widely, with two devices evaluated more than 500 times, one 190 times and 6 less than 50 times. The explanation lies in the large number of failures for Branan Medical Oratect, Ultimed Salivascreen and Varian OraLab, which led to their exclusion from the study and the late start of the evaluation of the American Biomedica Oralstat, Lifepoint Impact and Sun Biomedical Oraline.  The percentages of positive samples were: amphetamines (including methamphetamine, ecstasy and analogues) 20 %, benzodiazepines 32 %, cannabinoids 36%, cocaine 19% and opiates 8%. The analytical evaluation of the amphetamine and methamphetamine tests (in comparison to the reference method in oral fluid) showed a sensitivity (percentage of the true positive samples that tested positive with the onsite assay) varying between 40% and 83% and a specificity (percentage of the negative samples that tested negative with the onsite assay) between 80% and 100%.  The analytical evaluation of the benzodiazepine tests (in comparison to the reference method in oral fluid) showed a sensitivity varying between 33% and 69% and a specificity between 85% and 94%.  The analytical evaluation of the cannabis tests (in comparison to the reference method in oral fluid) showed a sensitivity varying between 0% and 74% and a specificity between 70% and 100%. Detailed analysis of the data for cannabis showed that some devices (e.g. Drugwipe) gave a negative result even when very high concentrations of THC were found with the Intercept. The reason is unknown, but one hypothesis is that with an improved (more thorough) sampling technique more THC could be captured, resulting in more positive results.  The analytical evaluation of the cocaine tests (in comparison to the reference method in oral fluid) showed a sensitivity varying between 0% and 97% and a specificity between 91% and 100%.  The analytical evaluation of the opiate tests (in comparison to the reference method in oral fluid) showed a sensitivity varying between 51% and 100% and a specificity between 86% and 100%.  No device met the criteria proposed during the Rosita-1 project (sensitivity and specificity &gt; 90%, accuracy &gt; 95%) for the amphetamines, benzodiazepines and cannabis. The Varian Oralab met these criteria for cocaine and opiates, but it gave 26% failures, so it cannot be recommended.  The operational evaluation of the Drugwipe showed that the sampling technique was well accepted by the police and the subjects, but the results, particularly for cannabis, were difficult to read. There were also problems when using it in cold weather.  The operational evaluation of the Dr√§ger DrugTest/Orasure Uplink showed that sample collection was easy and hygienic, but that the procedure was long and complicated. The test must be read by an instrument, so it cannot be used in remote areas or when no instrument is available.  The operational evaluation of the American Biomedica Oralstat showed that the collection stick lost one of its collection sponges in some cases. This test could also be read with or without the reading unit, but the scanning of the test strip by the electronic reader was sometimes difficult.  The operational evaluation of the Branan Medical Oratect showed that the test was liked by the police officers, because it is very small and portable and no additional equipment is needed, but the sample collection was too complicated, it could be outsmarted by the tested persons and it took too much time. The number of failures was too high. The operating procedure of the RapiScan was fairly direct, but was found to intimidate officers if they were not able to use it soon after training. Many officers were uncomfortable using the instrument, stating that it was difficult to remember the procedure.  The operational evaluation of the Lifepoint Impact showed that in many cases the collected sample volume was not sufficient because the instrument stopped the sampling automatically after a preset time.  The test procedure of the Sun Biomedical Oraline was simple with few steps but a rather large sample volume was needed and it took too much time. There were problems to use it in cold and rainy weather. The lines indicating positive or negative results were too pale.  The operational evaluation of the Ultimed Salivascreen showed that the device gave more invalid than valid tests. Officers reported smearing of the result bands or not enough saliva collected by the device to give a reading.  The operational evaluation of the Varian OraLab showed that subjects were often unable to provide sufficient oral fluid during specimen collection, resulting in many invalid tests. Officers also experienced difficulty observing the presence or absence of the test lines making interpretation of results inconsistent.  At the end of the study, no device was considered to be reliable enough in order to be recommended for roadside screening of drivers. However, the experience in the state of Victoria in Australia shows that random roadside oral fluid testing of drivers for methamphetamine and cannabis (using the Securetec Drugwipe followed by the Cozart Rapiscan and chromatographic analysis in the lab) has a deterrent effect. Government officials should carefully weigh the pros (deterrent effect) and the cons (risk that drivers will realise that they often test negative after having used drugs due to the limited sensitivity of the test) of introducing random drug testing with the currently available devices.  \***********  There's also a lot of interesting research [here](http://www.druid-project.eu/cln_031/nn_107534/sid_6E14D14C82CBA37545824F6E8043859A/nsc_true/Druid/EN/deliverales-list/deliverables-list-node.html?__nnn=true).

The XPS 15z also only has a 720p display, which isnt going to be very good if your looking to ENJOY the gaming experience of playing Diablo 3. (Please note, Im not much of a Gamer!) The XPS 15z is more for the college student who is looking for something 15 inches, but light, and clean looking in terms of aesthetics.   Go with XPS 15, and upgrade the screen resolution. An upgraded XPS 15 with i5 processor, 6GB Memory, 750 Hard Drive, NVIDIA¬Æ GeForce¬Æ GT 525M 1GB graphics with Optimus Card, and 1920x1080 Display is STILL CHEAPER than the XPS 15z, coming at a total of $830+Tax after $100 off coupon, and the Dell Student Discount (PM me for these I cant post the Member purchase ID number on forums)   HOWEVER: UNTIL MAY 10th: If you want to upgrade the Video card to a NVIDIA¬Æ GeForce¬Æ GT 540M 2GB graphics with Optimus, then your total purchase price would then be CHEAPER: at $705+Tax, since we're offering 20% off all laptop purchases over $999. This is with the student discount as well.  If you want to plaay around with adding things to/from your cart, here's the Memmer Purchase Price Link: Dell.com/Berkeley. (You dont have to be a student to get the discount. BTW). In order to buy anything from this site you have to PM me for the Member ID.",¬Æ

t5_2qh1i,LexLuthor01,1336440508,"Step 1  The enzyme hexokinase phosphorylates (adds a phosphate group to) glucose in the cell's cytoplasm. In the process, a phosphate group from ATP is transferred to glucose producing glucose 6-phosphate.  Glucose (C6H12O6) + hexokinase + ATP ‚Üí ADP + Glucose 6-phosphate (C6H11O6P1)   Step 2  The enzyme phosphoglucoisomerase converts glucose 6-phosphate into its isomer fructose 6-phosphate. Isomers have the same molecular formula, but the atoms of each molecule are arranged differently.  Glucose 6-phosphate (C6H11O6P1) + Phosphoglucoisomerase ‚Üí Fructose 6-phosphate (C6H11O6P1)  Step 3  The enzyme phosphofructokinase uses another ATP molecule to transfer a phosphate group to fructose 6-phosphate to form fructose 1, 6-bisphosphate.   Fructose 6-phosphate (C6H11O6P1) + phosphofructokinase + ATP ‚Üí ADP + Fructose 1, 6-bisphosphate (C6H10O6P2)   Step 4  The enzyme aldolase splits fructose 1, 6-bisphosphate into two sugars that are isomers of each other. These two sugars are dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde phosphate.  Fructose 1, 6-bisphosphate (C6H10O6P2) + aldolase ‚Üí Dihydroxyacetone phosphate (C3H5O3P1) + Glyceraldehyde phosphate (C3H5O3P1)   Step 5  The enzyme triose phosphate isomerase rapidly inter-converts the molecules dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde phosphate. Glyceraldehyde phosphate is removed as soon as it is formed to be used in the next step of glycolysis.  Dihydroxyacetone phosphate (C3H5O3P1) ‚Üí Glyceraldehyde phosphate (C3H5O3P1)   Net result for steps 4 and 5: Fructose 1, 6-bisphosphate (C6H10O6P2) ‚Üî 2 molecules of Glyceraldehyde phosphate (C3H5O3P1)  Step 6  The enzyme triose phosphate dehydrogenase serves two functions in this step. First the enzyme transfers a hydrogen (H-) from glyceraldehyde phosphate to the oxidizing agent nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) to form NADH. Next triose phosphate dehydrogenase adds a phosphate (P) from the cytosol to the oxidized glyceraldehyde phosphate to form 1, 3-bisphosphoglycerate. This occurs for both molecules of glyceraldehyde phosphate produced in step 5.  A. Triose phosphate dehydrogenase + 2 H- + 2 NAD+ ‚Üí 2 NADH + 2 H+  B. Triose phosphate dehydrogenase + 2 P + 2 glyceraldehyde phosphate (C3H5O3P1) ‚Üí 2 molecules of 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate (C3H4O4P2)   Step 7  The enzyme phosphoglycerokinase transfers a P from 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate to a molecule of ADP to form ATP. This happens for each molecule of 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate. The process yields two 3-phosphoglycerate molecules and two ATP molecules.  2 molecules of 1,3-bisphoshoglycerate (C3H4O4P2) + phosphoglycerokinase + 2 ADP ‚Üí 2 molecules of 3-phosphoglycerate (C3H5O4P1) + 2 ATP   Step 8  The enzyme phosphoglyceromutase relocates the P from 3-phosphoglycerate from the third carbon to the second carbon to form 2-phosphoglycerate.  2 molecules of 3-Phosphoglycerate (C3H5O4P1) + phosphoglyceromutase ‚Üí 2 molecules of 2-Phosphoglycerate (C3H5O4P1)  Step 9  The enzyme enolase removes a molecule of water from 2-phosphoglycerate to form phosphoenolpyruvic acid (PEP). This happens for each molecule of 2-phosphoglycerate.  2 molecules of 2-Phosphoglycerate (C3H5O4P1) + enolase ‚Üí 2 molecules of phosphoenolpyruvic acid (PEP) (C3H3O3P1)   Step 10  The enzyme pyruvate kinase transfers a P from PEP to ADP to form pyruvic acid and ATP. This happens for each molecule of PEP. This reaction yields 2 molecules of pyruvic acid and 2 ATP molecules.  2 molecules of PEP (C3H3O3P1) + pyruvate kinase + 2 ADP ‚Üí 2 molecules of pyruvic acid (C3H4O3) + 2 ATP Summary In summary, a single glucose molecule in glycolysis produces a total of 2 molecules of pyruvic acid, 2 molecules of ATP, 2 molecules of NADH and 2 molecules of water.   Although 2 ATP molecules are used in steps 1-3, 2 ATP molecules are generated in step 7 and 2 more in step 10. This gives a total of 4 ATP molecules produced. If you subtract the 2 ATP molecules used in steps 1-3 from the 4 generated at the end of step 10, you end up with a net total of 2 ATP molecules produced. ",‚Üî

It seems the only downside you see is that; some people will complain about it, it doesn't go far enough, and it could be repealed by a future govt.  Yes?  I don't see a whole lot of risk to Australia in implementing the bill as it stands.  If the price is too high, it can be lowered fairly easily.  The risk to export industries is tiny, given it's only $1.27 per tonne for those industries.  The impact on GDP is 0.7%, easily manageable given the rest of our economic conditions.  Where are the real cons?  &gt; Normally a 'con' would be seen as a reason not to implement a scheme. I don't think any of your reasons fit that bill.  Not necessarily.  Cons are potential problems with a scheme.  The only reasons not to enact this legislation are (a) to abandon Australia's bipartisan 5% reductions target entirely, or (b) that this scheme isn't the most cost effective way to achieve that target.  I don't think either apply.  But there's room within the scheme itself to be poking and prodding at its boundaries and shape - which industries are compensated, should there be more compensation for industries that produce goods domestically in competition with an import market, is the price too high or too low, what mechanisms should be used for introducing the scheme, what emissions sources should be in or out, and so on.  Perhaps another con, then, is that the opposition abjectly failed to provide any constructive opposition to debate those fine points, choosing instead to spend all their effort labelling the entire kit and caboodle as Bad‚Ñ¢; but fortunately, the independents and the Greens did have those discussions.  For better or for worse, Windsor had fuel exempted to protect the interests of his electorate, for example.",‚Ñ¢

More on that later, I'm sure.).  If I wasn't enrolled in an actual summer program, I was doing some sort of home-made coursework, usually purchased from some grocery store magazine section or from the actual teaching store down the street from our house.  One summer I remember having to put on a play.  That was the requirement: ""Put on a play!"" So we Put on a Play!  But there were a few hitches: we had to write, direct, and act in it ourselves.  There was the side part of building the set pieces and making the costumes, but that part seems a bit fuzzy to me, as though maybe I'd been slipped a pill somewhere, because the only real part of all that theater, to me, are the following: 1. I think the teacher had grey hair, and that he was a male. 2. I don't recall him saying or doing anything other than to say: ""Yes!"" 3. We decided to remake Ghostbusters‚Ñ¢ 4. My costume was a pair of bike shorts and the hose from our vacuum cleaner. 5. there was a girl.   6. I think we saved her from ghosts.   7. I wanted to kiss her.   8. We made a cardboard box into the Ecto-1. 9. Pretty sure my friend Jerad was there. 10. He had bike shorts, too, but I might also be mixing this memory with the time we used the same bike shorts (and pillows stuffed into them)  to perform a skit at the 6th grade talent show wherein we mimicked the New Kids on the Block and made fun of ""Hangin Tough"".  Nevertheless, it wasn't our decision, really to write or perform the Ghostbusters play.  We didn't know what we were doing and we had no actual practice in reading, writing, directing, or acting in any sort of stage plays -- we were the pretending to know what we were doing.  And our parents showed up, because they played that part, as well: the people who didn't know what to do with what they were seeing.  And what they were seeing was ultimately the same person they'd see today if they walked into the meetings I now direct and lead: a boy with short pants on, running around screaming with a toilet plunger in his hand, pretending it was all something other than what it was.",‚Ñ¢

Le pont est travers√©e par la Route bleue (RD213).

Avec sa trav√©e centrale de 404 m, l'ouvrage m√©tallique de 720 m d√©tenait √† sa construction le record mondial de port√©e pour un pont m√©tallique hauban√©.  En 1992, le conseil g√©n√©ral de la Loire-Atlantique a pris le contr√¥le de la SAEM du pont de Saint-Nazaire concessionnaire de la construction et de l'exploitation de l'ouvrage. L'acc√®s au pont devient gratuit par suppression du p√©age le 1er octobre 1994.  L'ouvrage a √©t√© vers√© au patrimoine routier du conseil g√©n√©ral de la Loire-Atlantique qui en assure la gestion et l'entretien depuis le 1er ao√ªt 1995. Depuis sa cr√©ation les √©changes entre le nord et le sud estuaire se sont consid√©rablement d√©velopp√©s. Caract√©ristiques et construction  L'ouvrage est constitu√© de deux viaducs d'acc√®s en b√©ton pr√©contraint de 1 115 m au Nord et de 1 521 m au Sud, et d'un ouvrage principal m√©tallique hauban√© de 720 m de longueur. Il est emprunt√© par la route d√©partementale RD2131.  La construction du pont a √©t√© confi√©e au groupement d'entreprises1 :      construction m√©tallique : compagnie fran√ßaise d'entreprises m√©talliques (CFEM) ;     ouvrages b√©ton : soci√©t√© g√©n√©rale d'entreprises (SGE) (les fondations ont √©t√© sous-trait√©es aux entreprises Morillon-Corvol, Courbot et Dodin).  Viaduc en b√©ton de type VIPP  Viaduc ind√©pendant √† poutres pr√©contraintes (VIPP)1 :      22 trav√©es au nord et 30 trav√©es au sud, de 50,70 m√®tres de port√©e ;     208 poutres pr√©contraintes de 2,80 m de hauteur et de 190 tonnes ;     une largeur de hourdis de 13,5 m entre garde-corps offrant 12 m de largeur roulable (utilis√©e en 3 voies routi√®res), et deux passages de services de 0,75 m ;     des pentes longitudinales de 5,6 %.  Montage1   Fabrication au sol des poutres, puis transport par fardier, et lan√ßage au moyen d'un lanceur m√©tallique permettant le ripage transversal. Ouvrage principal m√©tallique      Un caisson m√©tallique hauban√© de 720 m de long et d'une hauteur de 3,20 m, en 3 trav√©es de 158 m, 404 m et 158 m, pr√©sentant une dalle orthotrope de 15 m de large ;     Un tirant d'air de 61 m au-dessus des plus basses eaux, sur 300 m de largeur ;     72 haubans, (de type c√¢bles clos) en 4 nappes en √©ventails, fix√©s √† deux pyl√¥nes m√©talliques en V invers√©s, articul√©s en pied, et dont la t√™te se situe sensiblement √† 130 m au-dessus des plus basses eaux1.  Montage1       Fabrication des deux tron√ßons de 96 m de chaque trav√©e de rive, approvisionn√©s par voie maritime depuis l'usine de Fos, par le d√©troit de Gibraltar ;     Assemblage sur deux barges de chaque trav√©e de rive sur 192 m de longueur (avec porte-√†-faux de 34 m en trav√©e centrale) ;     Hissage du caisson assembl√© et de chaque pyl√¥ne couch√©, par cr√©maill√®res et v√©rins ;     Relevage des pyl√¥nes ;     Hissages successifs en trav√©e centrale des tron√ßons de 16 m et mise en place et r√©glage √† l'avancement des haubans ;     Clavage.  Piles Pyl√¥ne      Les piles courantes (52, non compris 2 cul√©es) sont constitu√©es de deux f√ªts en forme de H de 3 m √† 57 m de hauteur, reposant sur une semelle fond√©e sur quatre pieux de 1,80 m ou 1,50 m de diam√®tre.     Deux piles principales de part et d'autre du chenal, sont creuses et form√©es de quatre cellules verticales fond√©es sur un groupe de 18 pieux de diam√®tre 1,80 m.     L'ensemble des pieux en b√©ton arm√© tub√©s et ancr√©s au rocher (environ 260) ont une longueur variable de 15 √† 50 m.  Les piles ont √©t√© construites par coffrages glissants1. Conditions de circulation  La vitesse y est limit√©e √† 70 km/h. La circulation peut √™tre interdite √† certains v√©hicules voire √† tous par grand vent.  Le Conseil g√©n√©ral a mis en place un syst√®me de gestion des voies du pont, qui permet au fil de la journ√©e ou en fonction d'√©v√®nements ponctuels, de consacrer une deuxi√®me voie au sens de circulation le plus sollicit√©. Ce syst√®me se traduit par des barri√®res de rabattement, des plots lumineux de couleur rouge incrust√©s dans le rev√™tement et des portiques supportant des panneaux signal√©tiques lumineux (fl√®che verte/orange ou croix rouge) pour indiquer le sens de circulation affect√© √† chacune des trois voies.  Unique en France, ce syst√®me est entr√© en service le 25 ao√ªt 2010 et est consid√©r√© comme ""exp√©rimental""2. En effet, cela est une exigence des services de l‚Äô√âtat car le code de la route pr√©voit une signalisation blanche au sol. Le conseil g√©n√©ral de Loire Atlantique √† donc re√ßu une autorisation pour 1 an, avec une possible reconduction.  Deux points3 sont n√©anmoins √† am√©liorer :      Le balisage lumineux car les LEDs sont trop fragiles.     L'intensification du trafic pendant la saison estivale qui, malgr√© ce nouveau syst√®me, provoque de nombreux bouchons.  Sport  Ce pont est la difficult√© non naturelle majeure existante dans des courses cyclistes. Ainsi, elle constitue la seule c√¥te dont l'origine n'est pas naturelle √† √™tre r√©pertori√©e lorsqu'elle est franchie (en 4√®me cat√©gorie) sur la route du Tour de France.

t5_2qplv,chowder88,1336507331,"Epic post dude! I feel just the same about this change.  This conflict always shows up in my worldview: Change the system from the inside or the outside?   IN: Speak their language, wear their clothing, laugh at their jokes, but never forget why you got there in the first place. Play the game as close to the line as possible without stepping out. You will eventually come out as a different person. But at least you managed to do that bit of change. Was it worth it?  OUT: Do your own thing. Be as close to your true nature as possible. Create new ways of growing food, providing shelter, etc. New ways of inter-human relationships and politics. Then just stand back and watch it grow.  The truth is that the solution is somewhere in the middle. We need *both*. We need people climbing the monster and poking it's eyes, getting lots of shit on their hands while doing so. But also we need people at the ground level, building a nice fluffy mattress for the monster to fall on.   Just observe where exactly in this game you stand, then *act*! If you have your hands already dirty, finish the god-damned job! If you were too lazy even start climbing it, at least help building the mattress. Bit by  bit.   All of the boundaries that were dissolved in the last ~50 years (gays, blacks, women) were achieved so quickly because the validity of their statement was unarguable. That's why I feel so hopeful for the future. The validity of the MDMA experience [in a proper set and setting(but even if not)] is something that no one will be able to take away. And also the power behind the drug experiences (and ultimately of the human mind), is what makes me think that change is closer than we might expect.   I am a Terence McKenna boy, but not too sure about the I-Ching and all that mumbo-jumbo. However, the exponential rate at which everything is changing/advancing is *not* debatable. It is happening. Just in the same manner that someone from 1900's could not even dream about the change in the following 100 years, we have to realize that it's gonna be just the same for us, just exponentially faster. And it is going to be a surprise for many. The end of this year seems to soon? I dont know...But let's not just wait and see.  Anyway, it seems I also was a bit carried away...

OK, so 660,000 new iPhone customers, 840,000 existing customers upgrading to an iPhone.  ""Approximately 8 percent of Sprint platform postpaid customers upgraded their handsets during the first quarter"", ""...total ending subscribers [was] a record 56 million."" ""...total net subscriber additions of nearly 1.1 million""  Take the 56 million at the end, remove the 1.1 million, multiply by 8%, gives 4,392,000. Subtract the 840,000 of those that were iPhone sales, and that's 3,552,000 non-iPhone phone upgrades sold.  Now take the 1.1 million new customers. We know 660,000 of those were new iPhone customers from our first calculation, so 440,000 were non-iPhone new customers.  So: New customer phone sales - iPhone 660,000 vs non-iPhone 440,000. Existing customer upgrades - iPhone 840,000 vs non-iPhone 3,640,000.  Now, notice what Business Insider does when it discusses the Sprint numbers:  &gt; At Sprint it activated 1.5 million iPhones, or 60% of all smartphones for the quarter  They start out by taking the new customer activation numbers, and indeed about 60% of those were iPhones.  &gt; If Apple accounted for 63% of 80% of the smartphone sales on those carriers, then it had 50% of the total smartphone market in the U.S. in the first quarter of the year.  But it didn't. Apple had 63% of the _new subscriber activations_. That's only a tiny fraction of the handset sales, as we can see from the numbers teased out of the Sprint press release.  For the iPhone to be 60% of smartphones sold at Sprint, Android upgrade sales would need to be 40/60 * 840,000 = 560,000, leaving 3.1 million people upgrading to non-smartphones. Or putting it another way, if BI's numbers are correct, only 38% of upgraders picked any kind of smartphone, while we know 60% of new subscribers picked iPhones, let alone how many picked Android. Those two numbers seem a bit unlikely in combination.  I dunno, maybe I've missed something, but it looks to me as if BI took a massive unsupported leap from ""60% of new subscriber activations"" to ""60% of phones sold"".",¬Æ

Every few days, we'd have a delivery to a house up the street for 12 wings, and every time, the dude would pay in a dirty sock full of mixed change, usually about 50¬¢ short.  One day, I got the delivery first thing after I clocked in. I took their wings out to my car and noticed the sock from the last time in my back seat. I looked back at the wings and couldn't resist. I took a couple bites from one wing, then put that and the rest in the dirty sock. I wrapped it all up, put it back in the box, and made the delivery. Of course, I was paid in sock-change, almost $2 short.  A couple days later, I had them again. This time, I ate a wing and a half, placed the bones and the rest of the wings in the most recent sock, and did it again. Surprisingly, they paid me in sock change.  Now I really had to change the game. About a week later ‚Äî the next time I had them ‚Äî I took the wings, ate two, put them and the rest in a sock, filled it with cheese, and placed it in the toaster oven we used to heat up bread sticks. I had to let it cool for 20 min on the asphalt outside so it wouldn't stick to my car's interior. I took the Cheesy Chicken Sockball‚Ñ¢, without a box, over to the dude's house.  I show up at the door, empty handed. He says ""Where are the wings?""  I say ""Where's the money?""  He hands me another dirty sock full of change. I take it back to my car, and grab his CCSB‚Ñ¢. When I place this soggy, greasy monstrosity in his hand, his face contorted with rage. He ranted and raged while he threw the CCSB‚Ñ¢ on the ground.  He finished with ""Go back and get me my fucking wings.""  I stared him dead in the eye and said ""You just threw your wings on the ground, and they cost $50, cash.""  He gazed at me like a child caught writing on the wall.  ""Get it,"" I demanded.   He was a deer in the headlights.  ""NOW!""

t5_2qh2p,Dudesan,1336544105,"Remember, many Christians find it more comfortable to believe in a god who doesn't condone, command or commit murder, slavery, rape, child abuse, animal abuse, arson, torture, ritual mutilation, fratricide, patricide, matricide, infanticide, genocide, and so on than to believe in one who does.  Unfortunately, since the Bible (Old Testamant and New) is pretty clear about Yahweh's position on these things, holding a belief in Loving Hippie Jesus‚Ñ¢ requires ignoring huge portions of it. Or just never reading it in the first place, which seems to be the most popular option.  Well, let's say what Jesus has to say about that:  &gt;‚ÄúDo not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished.  (Matthew 5:17-18, NIV)  Some Christians claim that his death and resurrection ""fulfill"" this. That is bullshit for one simple reason: last time I checked, Heaven and Earth haven't passed away.  Jesus also made his views on people ""picking and choosing"" quite clear:  &gt;[Jesus] answered them, ‚ÄúAnd why do you break God‚Äôs commandment because of your tradition? For God said:    *Honor your father and your mother;* and, *The one who speaks evil of father or mother must be put to death.*  &gt; But you say, ‚ÄòWhoever tells his father or mother, ‚ÄúWhatever benefit you might have received from me is a gift committed to the temple‚Äù‚Äî  he does not have to honor his father.‚Äô In this way, you have revoked God‚Äôs word because of your tradition. Hypocrites! Isaiah prophesied correctly about you when he said:    &gt;These people honor Me with their lips, but their heart is far from Me.  They worship Me in vain, teaching as doctrines the commands of men.‚Äù  (Matthew 15:3-9, NIV)   Looks like Jesus has quite a bit to say about people who ignore commandments, in fact. But maybe it's just Matthew?  &gt;It is easier for heaven and earth to disappear than for the least stroke of a pen to drop out of the Law.  (Luke 16:17, NIV)  Okay, so Jesus is a bust. Let's see what the Epistles have to say about the Mosaic Code:  &gt; If you really keep the royal law found in Scripture, ‚ÄúLove your neighbor as yourself,‚Äù you are doing right.  But if you show favoritism, you sin and are convicted by the law as lawbreakers. For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it.   (James 2:8-10, NIV)  &gt;All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness,  (2 Timothy 3:16)  &gt;Do we, then, nullify the law by this faith? Not at all! Rather, we uphold the law.  (Romans 3:31)  Well, shit.  ",‚Ñ¢
t5_2qhwp,johnelwaysteeth,1336544187,"the reason starcraft 2 doesn't have lan isn't because it's an anti-piracy thing, it's because of an organization in south korea called Kespa.  They ran all of the biggest brood war (sc1) tournaments, and didn't give any of the profits to blizzard.  Because they could just host the games over lan, there was no way for blizzard to stop them from running these tournaments.  These aren't small scale tournaments either, these are tournaments airing on cable television, with prize pools in the hundreds of thousands of dollars.    This, plus kespa's lack luster treatment of a majority of players (especially foreigners) led blizzard to take lan out of starcraft 2, and restrict the rights to tournaments with a prize pool over 5,000 usd buy shutting down their connections to the server unless they were approved.  This has gone great in the rest of the world, but this caused sc2 in korea to only be on one network (gom) and has hindered the growth of the game their greatly.  Blizzard recently came to terms with Kespa, and their leagues will begin playing SC2 later this summer.  With all that said, the first ""expansion"" for sc2 will be coming out next year (soon‚Ñ¢) and even with the bridges rebuilt with kespa, sc2 is still a big time player in the esports scene and draws a lot of money into big tournaments.  I doubt blizzard will be returning LAN to sc2 any time soon.  I know this was long winded and rambling, but at the same time it's only a short summery of what went on between Broodwar and SC2.  It's not a simple case of cutting a feature to prevent piracy like is commonly thought of.",‚Ñ¢

My question is this: Would you mind checking out some of my casts on Youtube and offering me some criticism? I feel like I've improved since then and I've been trying to push out more videos each day.

t5_2qh38,captain_obvious_here,1336584190,"&gt;which I'm not sure I understand for Apache  Only reason I see is when you use home-made Apache modules and are facing bugs in the core API. This happens on a regular basis in my company, and the people in charge of that project are usually happy to see that the latest version fixes deep core bugs. This is always better than having to debug or rewrite tons of critical stuff in their modules.  But except for that specific case, Apache is a very mature project : sticking to 2.2 is **good enough¬©**, performances and features-wise.  For Linux + Apache + Mysql + PHP, my rule of thumb is to stick to stable. Unstable and testing versions are usually not worth the trouble. And if you need better performance in your app, look at your code before you think the problem comes from the stack it relies on.",¬©

Like ¬´¬ª‚Äú‚Äù‚Ä¶¬∞‚Ñ¢‚Äì¬µœÄ√ü‚àÇ∆í‚àöÔ¨Å√∂√∑‚âà√ß‚Äπ‚Ä∫ * Mac OS lets you use a MIDI device without 3rd party software. * Mac OS lets let you view PDF's and PSD's without 3rd party software. * Mac OS has advanced screen shot functions, like capturing only portion of the frame, icons, windows, items etc. which are a godsend for designers making nifty software presentations. * Mac OS has Keynote.app, with blows Power Point out of the water on both ease of use and final appearance. It has some basic transition effects which are nice for presenting progressional, visual work, like the feathered scan line effect. * Mac OS lets you copy/paste images directly into to property panel of files, which are great for software developers needing to test icons.  Yes, this is getting ridiculously detailed, but the list goes on‚Ä¶  * Mac OS has a clean interface. Less colors, less borders, better iconography, better typography, better interface design. Does this matter? Well‚Ä¶ * Designers are obsessed with details and have a low threshold for engaging into obstructions, thus ends up reflecting over, and complaining about every little thing that could have been better with either some small adjustments or maybe a complete redesign, instead of doing some actual work. * Many designers are technologically incompetent. * Macs are design icons, and every designer can learn something from using one. * Macs have great build quality. The Mag-Safe adaptor and the lack of a mechanical tray on the optical drive are both gimmicks which I now love because of my clumsiness. The only moving part is the screen hinge, which admittedly sucks on some older models (like the 2008 Macbook Pro and 2008 Macbook Air), but are apparently better now. Yeah. Apple also has‚Ä¶ rotten apples.  Some of them silly details (which accumulates)  * Macs have optical audio out integrated into the 3.5"" jack. * Macs have backlit keyboards (for noob writers) * Did you know that the LED indicator on a sleeping Mac has the same frequency as a sleeping persons breath? LOL DESIGNER CIRCLEJERK HIGH FIVE * Macs have a large trackpad. About double the size of that of a ‚Äúregular‚Äù laptop, with multi touch gestures which is neat for zooming or rotating graphics. * Macbook keyboards collects very little dust or dirt when the screen is down because of the neat rubber rim around it. * The rim also makes for nice soft damping when closing the screen, which in the long run will protect from wearing. * The Caps Lock key is protected from accidental touching. It needs a firm, not to quick touch for activation. * The trackpad is also protected from accidental touching. You can't move the cursor using the lower part of your thumb, which is great given that the trackpad is huge.   Is it worth the extra 25%? It's really up to you. Macs are great for direct human‚Äìcomputer interaction in a windowed environment. That said, you wouldn't buy a Mac for gaming or as a file server, or as a rendering farm ‚Äì even though you were a designer. ",‚Ñ¢

However, the link in the bar on the right ([A great reference/sandbox for playing with CSS](http://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp)) has a few things that might do what you're trying to. For instance, the header image snippet:  /*Changes your reddit's name (at the top) to an image. All '??' must be edited to the dimentions  you want your image to be.*/        .redditname a{     background:url(IMAGE);     height: ??px;     width: ??px;}          #header-bottom-left{     height: ??px;}          .redditname a{     text-indent:-9001px;     }          #header-img-a,     .redditname a,     .tabmenu {     display: inline;     float: left;}          .tabmenu{     position:relative;     top:100%;     margin-top:-16px!important;}  For other stuff, if it's something you've seen before, steal away!  You can view any sub's stylesheet at reddit.com/r/*redditname*/stylesheet.css . For instance, /r/Lovecraft has a background image.  I found it mashing Random over and over hoping to find a well commented stylesheet but I gave up (I can't really talk, mine are horrible). But anyway, this bottom section of the page is the code you need:      body {         background: url(http://thumbs.reddit.com/t5_2qjt4_8.png) no-repeat fixed center center         }   Replace the URL with the image you upload from the stylesheet editing page (will give you the URL there).  Anyway, no need to reinvent the wheel if you just want to get rolling. (ha ha! Wheel puns.) Look around for the stuff you want to do, steal it, tweak it, credit it if you're feeling charitable, and just have fun!  If I have one common-sense tip (as in, I don't know why I didn't do it myself earlier), it's this: make yourself a little test subreddit you can try things out on, especially if your sub already has subscribers. That way you don't throw a wrench in the works and kinda throw everything off while people are trying to use it.  Good luck!",¬Æ

Best advice I can give is look at ""basic"" examples that do what you're after. To that end, what comes to my mind is the [NaCl example](http://bulletphysics.org/nacl/) for Chrom{e,ium}.  Also... if the wiki's outdated, check the date on the wiki then check the latest stable release of the time. While you may not think it, physical simulation is a bleeding edge area of science, many physical processes simply aren't understood, and our current best models are very easy to poke holes in if one knows where to poke. As such I would expect Bullet would be a Moving Target‚Ñ¢, if only because of the recent addition of GPU computing really buggering up ""industry standard"" ways of simulating physics.",‚Ñ¢
t5_2rtff,HINDBRAIN,1336639419,"Okay. There are tons of complexities I am not getting into, either because explaining would take too much time or that I lack knowledge.  In programming, strings are basically arrays of characters. Sometimes they have additional shit (in C they are just a sequence of characters with a '\0' at the end, in C++ they also have methods and such for easier manipulation, and I'm not getting into encoding).  If you look at the [function prototype,](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/clibrary/cstring/strstr/)             char * strstr (       char * str1, const char * str2 );  You will notice that this returns a pointer to a character (the first char *). You can consider this more or less the address of a character in your RAM.  The arguments of the function are also pointers to characters: as this is a C function in this case, it takes C strings. In this case, you simply input the address of the first character of the sequence.   Suppose you pass it an adress and it reads a character there, in this case 'v'. Your memory from this address looks like that:      'v' 'i' 'd' 'y' 'a' '\0' 'e' 'o' '‚ô™' 'p' etc  It will iterate from the 'v' until it encounters the '\0'. What comes after the '\0' is random shit from elsewhere, so make extra sure you are not reading there when you are coding. (it could crash, or worse, not crash and give a wrong result).    Then, supposing you gave it valid addresses, it will search for the contents of the sequence stored starting from str2 into the contents of the sequence stored into str1. It does this with a lot of loops and tests basically.  Suppose you have this at the adress str1:  'v' 'i' 'd' 'y' 'a' '\0' 'e' 'o' '‚ô™' 'p' etc  and this at the adress str2:  'd' 'y' '\0' 'j' '¬ß' 'p' '*' '‚ò∫'  etc  it will iterate until it finds ""dy"" at the adress str1 + 2, and return str1 + 2. Why str1 + 2? Because str1 is a char pointer, and you moved forward by 2 chars (the ""unit"" of the pointer if you will). A char is often one byte, by the way.  Then you could for instance write this:      printf(""%s"",str1+2); //meaning ""print the string at str1 + 2      It would display ""dya"".      printf(""%c"",str1+2); //meaning ""print the character at str1 + 2      Would display ""d"" because you are only asking for the character at that address.  strstr will return a null pointer if the string is not found, which is what I use in my pseudo code. || means ""OR"". [something not null] OR [something] is always [something not null] in C (probably 1 but I can't be bothered to check). The if will proceed to its nested instructions if you feed it something not null. Meaning if the comment or its parent contains ""Ron"", the bot will proceed and downvote.  This is assuming comment-&gt;contents is a c string; but it's usually easy to convert stuff into c strings (for instance, in c++, you could use comment-&gt;contents.c_str()   )",‚ò∫

t5_2qhkh,pour_some_sugar,1336696035,"Apparently there concerns about Glyphosate staying in the ground and causing residual damage.   [Here's an article about Purdue Professor Emeritus Don Huber and his letter to US Agriculture secretary Vilsack that was leaked](http://www.greenpasture.org/fermented-cod-liver-oil-butter-oil-vitamin-d-vitamin-a/more-on-glyphosate---don-hubers-warning-to-vilsack-and-his-cover-letter/)  The article contains paragraphs such as this: &gt;Increased severity of plant diseases after glyphosate is applied (Fig. 3) is well documented and, although rarely cited, the increased disease susceptibility is the herbicidal mode of action of glyphosate (Johal andRahe,1988, 1990; Johal and Huber, 2009; Schafer et al, 2009, 2010). The loss of disease resistance in Roundup Ready¬Æ sugar beets when glyphosate was applied prompted researchers at the USDA sugar beet laboratory to include a precautionary statement in their paper, e.g. ‚ÄúPrecautions need to be taken when certain soil-borne diseases are present if weed management for sugar beet is to include post-emergence glyphosate treatments‚Äù (Larson et al, 2006).  I have no personal opinion on glyphosate, just happened to see the news about increasing concern of residual effects recently.   This explains how the increased plant diseases come about:  &gt;Extensive research has shown that this potent tool for weed management, glyphosate, is also a strong immobilizer (chelator) of essential plant nutrients to impair nutrient uptake, translocation, and physiological efficiency at only a fraction of the labeled herbicidal rate (Ekers, Ozturk, Cakmak, Zobiole, Jolly et al., 2004). Glyphosate is a powerful biocide to harm beneficial soil organisms important for nutrient recycling, N-fixation, nutrient availability, and natural disease control (Kremer &amp; Means, Zobiole et al, Dick et al) with a resultant increase in diseases of corn, soybeans (Fig. 3), wheat and other crops. The close relationship between mineral nutrition and disease severity is well documented (Datnoff et al, 2007). These activities can have deleterious effects on plant nutrition, disease susceptibility, and nutritional quality of the crop produced.",¬Æ

From [mp1st.com](http://mp1st.com/2012/05/11/battlefield-3-battlefield-premium-leaked-new-bonus-content-and-double-xp-weekend/):  Update: A double XP weekend has been confirmed by Battlefield 3 German Community Manager, Andreas Koch.  Original Story: It looks like Battlefield fans can anticipiate a very interesting month in the Battlefield 3 universe this June and beyond.  According to information we have received from reliable inside sources, we‚Äôve learnt of a recent fact sheet that lists some interesting dates as well as some very interesting pieces of Battlefield 3 content that DICE and EA seem to have planned in the near future. On top of some extra ‚Äúbonus content,‚Äù including the Close Quarters DLC and a player guide, can fans also expect a ‚ÄúPremium‚Äù service to bundle these content drops together?  Check out these release dates of upcoming pieces of Battlefield 3 content as listed on the fact sheet:      04-06-2012 ‚Äì Battlefield Premium     12-06-2012 ‚Äì Close Quarters     XX-06-2012 ‚Äì Guide     XX-08-2012 ‚Äì Bonus Content  Battlefield Premium: This doesn‚Äôt come as too much of a surprise, seeing that EA has toyed with the idea of a subscription-based service before. However, it‚Äôs not clear whether Battlefield Premium is actually a subscription-based service or if it is simply a one-time cost that will cover the content included in it. The official description reads:      Battlefield‚Ñ¢ Premium will land you a number of content drops with unique in-game items not available anywhere else. First out is the one-of-a-kind Premium knife and black dog tag, plus a set of soldier camos, weapon camos, dog tags and Assignments that will make sure you stand out and get more personalization options.  If this comes to fruition, we can expect to learn more about it in the coming weeks before it releases June 4th, 2012.  Close Quarters: Close Quarters is DICE‚Äôs second Battlefield 3 expansion pack which will focus on tight, infantry-based combat and will include new 4 new maps as well as 10 new weapons and assignments. It will also feature the brand new game mode, Conquest Domination. You can check out the latest gameplay trailer ‚ÄúDonya Fortress‚Äù here. While most of this was known earlier, what has not yet been revealed is it‚Äôs release date. According to this fact sheet, we can expect Close Quarters to drop June 12th, 2012, meaning PS3 owners will get a head start on June 5th, 2012.  Guide: Sometime next month, Battlefield 3 players can ‚Äùget the upper hand with this strategy guide, teaching you how to improve and become an even more skilled player.‚Äù  Bonus Content: Not much is known about this ‚Äúbonus content,‚Äù other than it will be available some time in August, 2012. It‚Äôs official description reads, ‚Äùenhance your Battlefield‚Ñ¢ experience with this bonus content drop.‚Äù  March 2013 DLC: We were also told a 5th, unannounced expansion pack is to hit Battlefield 3 sometime in March, after DICE‚Äôs already announced End Game expansion.  Double XP: Additionally, it has also been revealed that starting tomorrow, May 12th, until Monday, May 14th, Battlefield 3 fans will be able to earn double the XP as they play throughout the weekend.  Though this news is unofficial at the moment, make sure to stay tuned to MP1st on Twitter and Facebook as we learn more! ",‚Ñ¢

Again I believe the best corse of action is to allow them to accomplish there goals but show them it has to be within certain means or else it's counter productive. Like you said psychopathy is when you don't feel guilt for what you have done nor will you but that doesn't mean they don't care about themselfs so with this logic I can see a psychopath staying a cold calculated person but still cares on how he impacts others, not because he cares about them but because he cares about how it will effect him. This logic can be summed up into if treat others like crap it's counter productive and it always makes it harder for yourself in the long run, why make it harder on your self. If you can show them the logic of operating this way not only will it make life easier but they will treat others in a more appropriate way.(Again not because they care about others but because they care about how others can impact them)     Thanks for reading my useless opinion.  üëç",üëç

t5_2qpp6,Holy__Check,1336846289,"Patch 1.5 ‚Äì The StarCraft II Arcade Arrives  Major changes are coming to StarCraft II with patch 1.5.0. The menu screen will be split into two distinct areas, and each will be focused on a distinct experience. The StarCraft II section will be where players go for head to head ladder competition, as well as custom games focused on traditional StarCraft II gameplay, such as melee maps and micro trainers. Meanwhile, the new Arcade section will the place where the community can find and play the vast array of custom games that explore the many possibilities of the StarCraft II editor. From tower defense to RPGs and beyond, the Arcade will bring your creations to players around the world. We want the Arcade to offer the best experience possible, so we‚Äôre making changes to improve everything from the interface to the editor itself. Your input can help us refine it even further. Here are some of the improvements we already have planned:  Global Changes  ¬∑ Added StarCraft II &amp; Arcade as game Types  o Creators define which basic type best fits the game that they have created. Each game will only appear in either StarCraft II or the Arcade.  ¬∑ Game Genres   o We‚Äôve used community feedback and the existing game list to create a comprehensive menu of genres for creators to choose from. Now players will have tools to more easily find the games they are looking for, which in turn gives creators an easy way to find their audience.  Arcade  ¬∑ Game Presentation  o Browsing ¬ß Browsing for games is a totally new experience. Players can search for games based on genre, over all popularity, star rating, newness, and recent spikes in popularity.  o Game Icons ¬ß The game icon contains a large game image (provided by the creator), the game‚Äôs name, and star rating. Hovering over the icon displays the game description.  o Game Info page  ¬ß Clicking on a game icon brings players into the Game Info page, a section devoted entirely to showing off what a game is all about, providing play instructions, and revealing other important information about the game.  ¬ß All the content in Game Info is under control of the game creator, except for reviews.  ¬ß Joining public matches and creating private games is done from the Game Info page. This will be the portal players return to again and again to play the game.  ¬ß Game Info contains these sections:  ¬∑ Overview: This will contain the game description, as well as screenshots that show off the action.  ¬∑ How to Play: This is where players will find the Basic Instructions, How to Win, and Advanced Instructions sections. This is also useful space for additional images to help players understand how to enjoy your creation.  ¬∑ Patch Notes: You‚Äôre able to update patch notes as often as you like, so players can see how the game is growing and improving.  ¬∑ Reviews: After playing, players can give your game a star rating and enter a text review. Once enough ratings are provided, your game gets an Average Star Rating. Players can also mark each other‚Äôs reviews as ‚ÄúHelpful‚Äù which will ensure that the best reviews rise to the top.  ¬∑ Tutorial support  o Creators can now publish tutorials. This is a powerful way to introduce new players and give them a place to learn the ropes before they dive in.  o A ‚ÄúPlay Tutorial‚Äù button appears on the Game Info page if a tutorial exists. Clicking the Play Tutorial button launches players directly into the tutorial game.  ¬∑ Game exclusive chat channels  o There is now a ‚ÄúJoin Chat‚Äù button on the Game Info page that allows players to join a channel named after your game, which makes connecting with other players and creating a community around your game easier than ever before.  StarCraft II Platform  ¬∑ StarCraft II is now a streaming game.  o It will only be necessary to download a fraction of game data to get into the action. We expect to bring even more players into StarCraft II worldwide by making access to the game both easy and fast.  ¬∑ Editor  o Added UI XML Editor for adding and modifying SC2Layout files  o Editor updated to use Visual Styles in Editor  o Added high resolution minimap support  o Font Style editing added to Text Editor  o Added Data Editor horizontal auto-layout to better utilize available screen space  o User-defined data system, accessed through the new User type in the Data module as well as the corresponding functions in the trigger library.  ¬∑ Cinematic Editor o New editor module with powerful tools for creating in-game cinematic sequences.  ¬∑ AI Editor o New editor module for user friendly management of AI wave timing and composition.  ¬∑ Galaxy o Trigger Debug Window support for breakpoints, stepping through functions, and variable inspection o Galaxy script code memory limit increased; 4x -10x more memory can be utilized depending on how scripts are being used. o Added support for passing structure, array, and function references as function parameters o Improved Galaxy error message output  ¬∑ Actor o Camera Actor added for controlling camera through actor events  o Scene Actor added for controlling global actor settings (Halo settings, Power visual hiding)  o Light Actor added for creating lights in the world  o Terrain Actor added for physics impact FX support  o Creep Actor added for higher performance creep effects including creep engulfment  o Ragdoll deaths and support for combat driven physics impulses  o Added support for water ripples and physics collision based water splashes  o Terrain squib support for tileset specific dust or snow clouds FX  o Line and Arc targeting cursor support  o Added ActorInfoDisplay cheat for live actor debugging  ¬∑ Game Engine  o Max selection size increased from 255 to 500.  o Added trigger event for Behavior apply/remove  o New Stunned flag for Behaviors that allows queuing commands   ¬∑ Graphics Engine  o Added support to define lighting regions in the game world  o Lighting can now be set per player  o Added unit specific Halo support for pre-targeting  o Anti-aliasing support  ¬∑ User Interface  o Custom unit status bar support added  o Added new in-game pathing display that shows the path a unit will take on the minimap  o Added self-cast hotkey support  o Added Font Glow support  o Added powerful control over frames, portraits, status bars, text, trigger dialogs and more. Full details, tips, and tutorials are being created to help creators take full advantage of these tools.  ¬∑ StarTools  o We‚Äôre making our internal art tools available to the public.  o StarTools is a set of plugins for Discreet¬Æ's 3ds max¬Æ, these tools allow advanced users to create, modify, and quickly preview models and animations, including particle and ribbon effects, that can be used in StarCraft II custom maps.  Updating Your Game for Patch 1.5  All game types  ¬∑ Set up your Type and Genre  o Games published prior to Patch 1.5 will still be available on the service when the patch goes live. All user created games will default to appearing in Arcade, under the ‚ÄúOther‚Äù genre.  o Creators will need to re-save their game in the 1.5.0 client version and select the Type and Genre where they want to their game to appear.  Arcade game types  ¬∑ Add a Game Icon Image  o The icon image is the first thing players see. It‚Äôs a great opportunity to make a first impression on potential players - check out existing app-stores for inspiration.  o Game Icon Images are added through the StarCraft II Editor.  ¬∑ Add Game Info  o Game Info is where players learn about your game and see what cool experiences it has to offer. At a minimum, you‚Äôll want to provide a complete Description, easy to understand How to Play Instructions, and some screenshots that make your game look awesome.  o Going a step further and creating customized images (e.g. a diagram of game controls, or a simple guide map of the play area) for Game Info will really help you stand out. The old saying about ‚Äúshow not tell‚Äù should be your motto here!  o Game Info is added through the StarCraft II Editor  ¬∑ Set up a default mode  o From the Game Info page, there‚Äôs a big ‚ÄúPLAY‚Äù button that most players will use to get into your game. This creates or joins a public lobby, of the default mode you define for your game.  o This means you likely want to set the default to what you consider your ‚Äúcore‚Äù game experience.  o Alternatively, some games have players set up gameplay parameters after they load into the match. This is fine, but it‚Äôs recommended to make the setup process as streamlined and user friendly as possible so new players aren‚Äôt scared off right when they start the game.  ¬∑ Build a Tutorial  o Tutorials are a powerful way to introduce new players.  o Ideally you‚Äôll give players a smooth introduction to game mechanics in a fail-safe environment, teaching them everything they need to have fun before they start playing your main game mode.   o Tutorials can also be built and used as a practice mode for players to experiment in a sandbox type environment.  o To use the Tutorial feature, first publish the tutorial map to Battle.net. Then you can configure your main game to point to the tutorial.",¬Æ

When I was still working on my assembler, every kind of string was just written with ``dat``s:      dat ~, ""16-bit length prefixed""     dat ~, p""8-bit length prefixed""     dat ""16-bit zero-terminated"", 0     dat p""8-bit with inline zero-terminator\0""     dat ~, p""Crazy \x80"", 0xe0000, "" mixed-mode "", p""insanity"", 0  Obviously the last one is not really *usable*.  :)  As for big-endian, I think it's perfectly reasonable.  It means that if you write a binary file to disk on SPARC, the same program can read it on x86 without having to deal with byte swapping madness.  Also remember that after Java's brief stint as a ""set top box language"", it was billed as an Internet‚Ñ¢ language, for which having everything serialise to network byte order by default is a good idea.  Again, I just don't *like* big endian, especially not when the DCPU convention is... *little endian*.  Confusion ahoy! ",‚Ñ¢

You plug your trusty tape-deck carriage ipod-adapter into the top of your Droid Incredible 2, set it to thump some Rage, slide your key into the ignition, click her forward to set the rumbling belly of your 125 horsepower chariot alight like zeus casting bolts of power ripping to earth from the heavens....and nothing. Turn it again, nothing. Again, nothing. This, my unfortunate friend, is a category 1 beakdown.  --------------------- *Step 1: When is your car dying?*  Is it simply dead after being at your house or in a parking lot for a couple hours or longer? No sweat, hop down to step 2. If your car is dying WHILE or SHORTLY AFTER you drive it, jump to step 3.   ---------------------- *Step 2: Not starting after sitting for a while: Determine what degree of nothing you are getting.*  When you click the ignition over into ""accessory"" mode, that first click that turns your radio on and makes the instrument panel beep at you, what do you get? Does everything turn on and work like normal? Do you get radio, odometer, AC, headlights etc? If not, there are three answers, with numbers in the brackets based on likelihood of occurrence: **you have a dead or poorly connected battery (9.9)**, **you have a faulty ignition switch (0.3)**, **you have a bad ECM (0.2)**. First thing is first: proceed to the step below concerning the care and feeding of car batteries. That will work. If not, try it again. In the highly, highly, unlikely event you're not back on the road yet, you're grounded, nighthawk. Lock up tight an get AAA on the phone.  On the other hand, when you click into accessory mode, and all of your in-car accessories DO activate, the problem becomes a hair different; it's still nothing of which to be afraid, my stationary friend. You actually probably still have a dead battery, and a jump is typically the recommended first line of attack. Click that key over and start the car. Does it go *tcktcktcktcktcktcktck* while all of your accessories get considerably dimmer? Bingo, dead battery, jump that bitch. Does is attempt to turn over *rurr-rurr-rurr-rr....."" Nice. Dead battery. Jump that bitch.  Now, if you have full accessory power, radio headlights and the works, but the car sits there like a 16 yr old broad on roofies and does absolutely NOTHING when you attempt to turn it over, we may have to start replacing parts. This is, typically, a symptom of one of two things, with their ratings for likelihood: **You have a faulty starter (8)** or **You have a faulty connection to your starter (3)**. I know how you absorbed choose-your-own-adventure books as an awkward youth in secondary school. Dust off those skills, R.L. Stine and scroll down to the section on starters before you're late for work.   --------------------------- *Step 3: Dying while driving or shortly after*  If your car exhibits this behavior out in the real world, perhaps you're sitting at a stoplight, trying to pull out of a parking lot, or just recently parked, and the shit just goes on ahead and dies you you: jump the car ONE TIME out of good faith. Can you make it more than 100 miles without it happening again? Good, that was a fluke. However, if you get jumped and the same thing happens any time inside of 100 miles, or your battery is dying frequently, this is caused by one of two things: **you probably need an alternator, son. (9)** or **you have a parasitic drain (2)**. All parasitic drain means is you have an accessory in the car, something electrical, that is not turning off like it is supposed to. So there your car sits at night, with the light in your glovebox or trunk or a shorted out cigarette lighter still burning away and draining your battery. I'll tell you how to fix this too.   ---------------------------- **The care and feeding of batteries.**  Pop that hood, Fonzie. We've got work to do. The first thing I want you to do is stop fucking around and get yourself some jumper cables. Like, stop reading this right now and go to the store and get some. Seriously, I'll wait. And don't get the cheap shit, either. I'm serious - you want your jumper cables to be like your wiener, (or your man's, ladies): thick, long and strong. Get dem ones with a nice sturdy gauge (thickness of the wires), a decent length over 6', and the big-ass honking clamps on the ends. Buy them, put them in your trunk/under your seat or wear them as a necklace as if Flavor Flav and the Pep Boys had a handsome, /o/ frequenting love child. Don't let me ever catch you breaking down without some cables on hand.   You will see the jumper boxes for sale. Portable boxes that look kind of like big plastic happy meals with jumper clamps sticking out of them. Socially Awkward Penguins who are too scared to ask a good samaritan for a jump are attracted to these. Don't fall for it. These things require maintenance - you need to keep them charged, they can fail, break, etc etc. Cables never do any of that. Think of jumper boxes like your significant other, cables like your dog. Who's going to still appreciate you after being locked in your trunk for 250 miles? That's what I thought.   Okay, are you back from the store? Good.  Let's check our battery connection. You have two wires hooking into either the top or side of your battery. One will have something LARGE and RED attached to it. That's your positive wire, indicated with a (+). The other is a black wire, less obtrusively decorated, marked with a (-). We call that a ground wire. Evaluate their connections to the battery itself. Start by wiggling the wires. Don't worry, you have to be sort of amazingly retarded to get yourself shocked, and even if you do, a car battery operates at just over 12 volts, barely enough to give your pet hamster a boner, so you're not gonna hurt yourself. Wiggle the wires, are they **firmly** connected to the battery? If so, continue, if not, you're going to need a **0.5'' wrench** to tighten them up.  Is the connecting hardware tight, but crusted up with a bunch of whitish greenish crap that looks like one of your roommates blew his nose onto it and topped it off with the backwash off his toothbrush? You've got corrosion, my standstill soldier. Whip out the trusty 0.5'' wrench and take those wires off. What you need to do is scrub this corrosion away any way you have at your disposal. The right way is with WD-40 and a wire brush, although a rag, old tee shirt, the scruffy portion of the inside of your sock or whatever you have may get you by in a pinch. Go to town on the battery post and the wire terminal, scrubbing off all the crap that you can. Seat the wires back onto their **correct posts** and tighten them down. Tighten them good, but don't go hulk hogan on them, overtightened terminals are as bad as corroded ones. Tighten them good and snug until the wire holds firmly on the post.  Whip out your jumper cables and attach the RED clamp to the exposed metal terminal or battery post on the POSITIVE (+) side of the battery. Attach the black clamp to EITHER the corresponding terminal on the negative (-) side of the battery or any sturdy piece of exposed metal under the hood. **FOR THE LOVE OF GOD Make sure the unattached clamps of the cables, the ones on the other side that attach to the other car, are NOT TOUCHING. EVER.** Do the same process for the other vehicle, attaching the red clamp to positive and the black clamp to the ground or any exposed metal. You will know you have a good connection when you get a little bit of sexy looking spark action on the red clamp when you hook it up. If you don't get this, check your clamps and wires until you're properly hooked up. Be aware that cross-connecting your jumper cables, getting the red and black clamps on opposite posts of two batteries, can be potentially disastrous. Like automotive 12/21/2012, seriously. At very least, you can destroy your battery ($90), or fry your ECM (up to $1000), at worst you can **literally set your shit on fire** and total your car. So take care to get them red clamps where they belong, on the posts marked with a (+). Hook 'er up, wait a few minutes, hop in your driver seat and start your rig, you're on the road.   Also, be good and throw a few bucks at whoever helped you or offer to buy them a drink. They will likely turn you down, which is good cause who knows if your piece of shit car will even make it to the bar anyway. I'm kidding. The other thing you will notice with your new handy dandy cables and car jumping knowledge is you are now a knight in shining armor, a bastion of hope and defense for category 1 motorists city wide. Wield this power liberally and generously, never being too shy or simple to not breathe roaring life into the vehicles of your brothers and sisters on the road. ",‚Ñ¢

t5_2qh2p,distactedOne,1336979094,"I was never really all that into the religion thing. I kinda ""went with"" some splinter of Christianity or another because that's what I randomly ran into while I was growing up, but never really gave it any *thought*.  When I started thinking about it, I was irrationally attached to the idea of the universe having a Grand Creator‚Ñ¢, so I pretty much thought ""okay there's no real proof of God, that doesn't mean you can just say he doesn't exist, therefore agnostic"". (Or ""agnostic theist"" on that grid every pedant in the thread was reaching for when they saw the word on its own.)  But atheism didn't really click until I read [this](http://lesswrong.com/lw/i3/making_beliefs_pay_rent_in_anticipated_experiences/) -- obviously, if a god *really* existed, it would have, at *some* point, done *something* that couldn't be explained any other way. It doesn't *completely* rule out a god; it's possible they'd be deliberately hiding from me, or my family, or all of humanity, or a random subset of humanity that happens to include me, or planet Earth in general, or... But all those explanations add to a tiny, tiny probability, and even then, a god that does *that* is pretty well ignorable anyway. (Also, *why*? But I didn't consider that until I tried putting together my belief history just now.) Agnostic theist evolved into agnostic atheist.  After reading [this article](http://lesswrong.com/lw/uk/beyond_the_reach_of_god/), though, I decided that a god was not only ""not real"", but ""not *possible*"". They would pretty much have to violate the laws of physics, all the time. Which, okay, they're gods, maybe a good working definition for ""god"" is ""being capable of violating the laws of physics"". But even then, they'd *never* be able to ""hide"" from us, and if they cared about humanity even a *little*, they wouldn't even try. (I realize, rereading the article, that this is at best tangential to its *actual* point, but that's what I got out of it initially.)  You can't *really know* anything with 100% certainty. But at this point, my confidence in the non-existence of a god of any sort is high enough that I call myself outright *atheist*, or ""gnostic atheist"" to the grid-wielders. (And the probability that Your Favorite Deity *in particular* rules the roost is, obviously, even lower.) Yes, I could be wrong. There could be something really wild I haven't considered, or one of the things I consider to be every-head-on-earth-explodes-simultaneously unlikely could be the real, actual truth. But... that's just too unlikely to even consider, really.  **tl;dr** I was lazy and it was slow, but looking at the actual, real world and knowing what it would *mean* if a god existed vs. didn't exist pretty well covered it. (The articles are what prompted me to *do* the looking.)",‚Ñ¢

We are not developing an app at this time, but we will definitely keep it in mind while planning our product priorities for the future.  We know that our recent release has broken most unsupported Pandora clients, and we do apologize for the surprise and inconvenience that undoubtedly caused to your listening experience. At a basic level, third-party applications are violating our Terms of Use and are obviously not authorized to sell (or give away) something that fundamentally derives its value from our product.  Beyond the boilerplate, though, the fact is that--while the use you are writing in about seems designed mainly to help folks listen to Pandora in their own way--some folks do use third-party unsupported client libraries in a harmful way, and so we make changes when we need to prevent this. Regrettably, we have no way of targeting changes towards some unsupported clients and not others--some are respectful of our business, but unfortunately we can't tell them from those that are not.   Even disregarding attempts at malicious use, we do of course still have to continue to upgrade our software, and unsupported clients have been broken by these sorts of routine changes many times in the past as well. We definitely do recognize that our actions limit the options available to well-intentioned listeners who do not want to use any of our endorsed clients, and we're genuinely sorry for the inconvenience this brings to our enthusiastic listeners like yourself!

As I see it, there are 2 plausible explanations one could have for stating this film is *""boring*""  1) Claimant has a short attention span. And if we are talking about  movies, why not come to the logical conclusion that this is a result of conditioning. Transformers‚Ñ¢ the movie doesn't ask anything of the audience except to gawp in amazement for 90 minutes at the pretty robots, the slo-mo explosions, and Megan Fox's tits. Michael Bay is known for having the lowest ASL in the history of film (3 seconds if he's feeling particularly Kubrickian that day), hence his fans are conditioned on low average shot lengths and are confounded by long takes. There are exceptions to this maxim, but long takes generally correlate with skilled, confident filmmakers and therefore good films.   2) Claimant has little education/experience with Film as an Art Form as opposed to a mere source of entertainment. It is reasonable to conclude that if one consumes only popular franchises and blockbusters, one is not likely to *dig deeper*. You simply can't understand what makes a film great if you don't actually a) see tons of them and b) have a rudimentary understanding of what it takes to make a great film and how the pieces fit.

t5_2qh1i,EricTheHalibut,1337068372,"The usual form of the argument is that women have the choice, after conception, to abort the child, and that therefore, at least in more progressive countries where abortion is cheap or free-at-the-point-of-use, and socially acceptable, she is carrying it to term because she wants to. That means that, since it is entirely her choice, the entire burden for the consequences of that choice should fall on her.   This, of course, raises a few questions:  1. How do we make sure the child is adequately funded? 1. How do we limit it, so that a woman can decide whether or not to become a mother with confidence? 1. What rights does the child have to know the identity of the father? 1. What if the man opts-out, but then either comes back or hangs around and acts like a father without actually having any legal responsibility? 1. What about the cost of abortion, plus travel, unpaid time off, and any complications that may arise?  There are probably a few others, but those are the ones I've seen often. There are, of course, many different answers to these questions, but those are mine:  1. Do whatever is done when the father is unknown, broke, dead, or cannot pay for some other reason. If we presume that many of the men who opt out are those who would be ""deadbeat dads"" under the current system, it probably wouldn't cost any more because while there might well be more men, there isn't the cost of chasing them. Also, it would mean the prospective mother knows that only state assistance will be available, which might discourage her from having the child at all. 1. IMO, based on the social norms of my own society, the decision should be made before sex, and be opt-in if there is no marriage or de-facto relationship and opt-out otherwise (that reflects that here, people would assume the mother will abort if there is no relationship and probably keep it if there is). That way, everyone knows where they stand, and there is no delay looking for the man and asking him what he plans to do. I'd suggest some form contract like:     &gt; I,  [man's name], accept joint parental rights and responsibilities for any and all offspring of myself and [woman's name] (hereafter referred to as ""the mother""),  under the terms of $ACT.  &gt;  &gt; ‚òë provided there is no indication of congenital deformities or disabling genetic disorders [space for both to initial]  &gt;  &gt;‚òë I request full custody in the event that any or all of the aforementioned children become wards of the state. [space to initial]  &gt;  &gt; [Signatures]    Obviously, the wording isn't all that critical, but you get the idea. Clearly, the required level of sobriety for that to be effective should be exactly the same as that required to consent to sex, although an opt-out version should probably be even simpler so it just requires two signatures on it to be completely valid.   .4. IMO, copy the rules for the parents of adopted children.  .5. Treat him like any other unrelated man - if the mother wants to allow them to meet, all well and good, but if not, he has no rights to resurrect the relationship without the mother's (or, if it is old enough, the child's) agreement.  .6. IMO, in normal circumstances the man should have to pay half if the cost is non-trivial. That is actually a win for unmarried women over the present rules if she doesn't want it, especially in those parts of the US where offering to pay for an abortion counts as accepting responsibility for the kid if she refuses.

t5_2s113,thibbledorfpwent,1337079435,"I was ok in the t-28 BUT I love watching good player in one. What I've seen good players do is get the 57mm chainsaw of doom and use the amazing speed and ok agility of that boat to show up where no one expects them, kind of like the spanish inquisition. Then they spam the heck out of their intended victim.  When I had it I was using the 85mm, which along with the speed allowed me to move from flank to flank to support pushes, help defense. It was a decent short/middle range accuracy tank (with the 85), so I could get the shots off and reposition rather quickly. BUT after watching sooooo many folks do the 57mm of death/rape/carnage I've seriously considered buying it back just to try it out in that style.   So my suggestion would be to get the top engine/57mm at the minimum and then see where the main lemming push is going and trail along behind it a little ways. Try and stay off to a flank of that herd if possible, let them spot the first wave of the enemy, at which point you want to move up and hit the spam of death‚Ñ¢ button. After 4-5 shots, remembering that if you are in the middle of the furball don't stop moving, once you get used to speeding in and hit-n-running you will have many complaints of ""Hax!"", you move back and get behind cover, see how the situation develops. MAKE SURE TO WATCH YOUR MINI-MAP. If you see another group getting surrounded or even overrun you are generally fast enough to get back and either save them or kill the guys who killed them. Your speed also enables you to get back to base defense really quick and arty will love you if you do hang back from the main push, say about 3-4 squares from arty and a square or two behind the push, and use your speed along with super fast rate of fire to counteract the t-50's and other fast scouts. The t-28 can be a very unpleasant surprise to light arty raiders.

Can the Battery Tender Plus successfully perform the initial charge on a new, flooded, motorcycle battery? &gt; &gt;Background: The motorcycle dealers receive batteries from the manufacturer in a dry state. The plates are dried out, and there is no acid in the cell compartments. (Do not confuse this with a dry-cell battery.) The dealer must fill the individual battery cells with acid and then put them on a shop charger to pre-charge prior to selling them to a customer. As the batteries arrive from the manufacturer, the plates are approximately 80% ""formed"". The initial pre-charge, post-formation charge, or more correctly, formation-finishing charge, must be conducted at a specific power level and for a specific time period. Each manufacturer has its own recommendations, for example one manufacturer recommends that the charger deliver a constant current equal to 10% to 15% of the battery amp-hour capacity and that the charge current be applied to the battery for a period of 5 to 10 hours. &gt; &gt;Answer 1) Certainly if the dealer has properly pre-charged the battery after filling it with acid, then the answer is ABSOLUTELY YES. &gt;Answer 2) If the dealer has not properly pre-charged th &gt;e newly filled battery prior to the sale, then the answer is YES, WITH SOME QUALIFICATIONS: &gt; &gt;Qualification A) The Battery Tender¬Æ Plus should be left on the new battery for a minimum of 24 hours on float, in addition to whatever amount of time it takes for the charger to get to the float stage. It is not clear how to correlate the 80% formed plates with a given state of charge once the cells are filled with acid. To be safe, assume that the batteries require a full 100% charge after the cells are filled. &gt; &gt;For example, a 16 Ah battery will take about 13 hours to get to the absorption voltage (constant 14.4 Volts). It may take another 6 to 8 hours to reach the float voltage (constant 13.2 Volts). This may sound awkward; because what happens is that the battery charge current drops while the absorption voltage is held constant. When the battery current drops to 0.1 amp, or if 6 to hours have elapsed at the absorption voltage, the charger automatically switches its output from 14.4 V to 13.2 V. So it may take the better part of 20 hours to reach the float stage. Add another 24 hours to that and you are at 44 hours. Throw in another 4 hours for good measure and you get a nice round, even 48 hours, or 2 days. &gt; &gt;Qualification B) Although there are probably several charging methods that will be equally effective, regardless of who manufactures the battery, in the interests of technical consistency, they will not officially sanction any initial charging method other than those published in their technical applications literature",¬Æ

t5_2r9po,coldmoonrisen,1337164624,"&gt;I don't see why TERA is considered a direct competitor to GW2 more than any other mmo.  This is likely because of a couple of reasons:  A. With Tera already having been released and Guild Wars 2 coming into its' final stages before launching, most people see them as being close enough on the launch timetable to be considered competitors.  B. Both Guild Wars 2 and Tera are considered different enough from World of Warcraft that they fall into a new category of MMO. While I'm sure most of us here are already familiar with how GW2 plans on distinguishing itself from its peers, Tera does this though specifically focusing on action-oriented combat. I'm not only talking about how a player controls their character, but also in how combat with an enemy is approached. This becomes particularly apparent once you reach level 20 and beyond in the game, where combat and enemies begins to feel much more reminiscent of a game like Monster Hunter rather than MMOs such as WoW or GW2.  By the way, don't take that last sentence the wrong way. I'm not implying that GW2 combat is similar to WoW. What I'm saying is that if you were to put GW2 on the ""MMO Sliding Scale of Combat‚Ñ¢"", with WoW at one end and Tera on the other, GW2 would fall somewhere between, pushing closer to Tera. Throw in the fact that Tera has what some people may consider the next generation of graphics in a MMO, as well as an innovative player political system, and you can see why people would consider Tera and GW2 to be competitors to each other.

t5_2qh03,Reich7979,1337187515,"Hi --  My guildie ""wangel"" started this thread up. I'm the guy who had the account banned and started the post on the SWTOR forums; which was later deleted but re-posted here.  Just to clear some things up.. my ""story"" is just that.  It's described in the post the way that it happened.  Here's the starting point.  I received THIS email from SWTOR customer support yesterday.  ---------- Dear Customer,  We are contacting you about your Star Wars‚Ñ¢: The Old Republic‚Ñ¢ account.  After investigation, we have discovered that your account was activated using a code obtained from a non-authorized source. As a result, we have temporarily suspended game and forum access until a valid code is applied to the account. You can obtain a valid Star Wars: The Old Republic game code from EA Origin‚Äôs service (http://store.origin.com/) or an authorized retailer. You can find a full list of authorized retailers by visiting http://buy.swtor.com/.  Please be aware that EA and BioWare are only able to offer refunds for products purchased via EA Origin. If you wish to receive a refund for the game code you purchased, you will need to contact the retailer or website from whom you purchased your game code.  Should you wish to discuss this decision further, or require assistance re-activating your account with a valid code, please feel free to contact us by emailing support@swtor.com. We apologize for any inconvenience or frustration this may cause, and hope to see you back in Star Wars: The Old Republic soon.  Yours sincerely,  Star Wars: The Old Republic Customer Service ----------  I provided all of the information noted in the original forum post and made a number of follow-up calls after that and also email asking about the ticket status which weren't answered.   This morning I received the following, (with personal identifiers removed): ---------  Dear Customer,  Account Name XXXXX Email address: XXXXXXXX  Thank you for contacting us regarding your complaint (ticket number XXXXXXX).  We have now completed our investigation into your complaint. After reviewing your case, we can see that your concerns are valid and justified. We will take great care to ensure that this does not occur again in the future. As a goodwill gesture, we have added 15 days complimentary game time to your account.  Thank you for your diligence in bringing this matter to our attention. As a valued customer, your feedback is very important to us.  Yours sincerely, Star Wars: The Old Republic Terms of Service -----------  The intended crux of my post was the level of customer service.  What was clearly a very simple mistake (my legit account code got put on a list of ""bad"" ones, despite being purchased directly from EA) and could/should have been handled after sending in a receipt -- or hell, even just giving them the EA order number; and pressing a button -- took more than a day to fix and probably spanned 3 continents.  Perhaps I'm a little fanatical about customer service in general since part of my career has been spend managing it (and also having been responsible for global outsourcing of it); but at the end of the day I really think companies too often forget that their customers are their lifeblood.  My thought on the subject is that if a customer really needs ""service"" in the first place, there's a breakdown in the ease of use of a service and/or good.  (There are exceptions of course).  Thanks to all for many comments supporting my frustration. ",‚Ñ¢

t5_2tex6,SanityInAnarchy,1337209773,"&gt; ""Character counting"" is the feature that has the least number of real world application, that at the same time is the most commonly cited when speaking of UTF-8.  Mostly, I think, because it's trivial to demonstrate. However, pattern matching, string slicing, and pretty much anything else I might want to do with a string other than shuffle it around and print it, all need proper Unicode support. I suppose there are some use cases where I could treat it as ASCII and pretend it's   &gt; Firstly, what characters do you want to count? Abstract characters (code points) or user-perceived characters (grapheme clusters)?  Clearly, *neither* of these is being done in Python, and both measures would agree that ‚òÉ is one character. (It's a snowman.)  &gt; Counting the number of code units, on the other hand, is useful. It answers the question ""how much memory this string occupies"" and this is the quantity used to limit the sizes of, e.g., fields in some database.  This depends on the database and the application. For example, if you've set an arbitrarily low limit on some field, do you tell the user ""Your username must be capable of being stored in 8 to 16 bytes"", or ""Your username must be 8-16 characters long""? The latter is at least consistent from the user's point of view.  This is also consistent with the actual usage of the 'length' operation. In Python, the 'len' function returns the number of items in an array, which corresponds neither to the number of bytes taken up by the references to these items (this is probably 64 bits per item) nor the number of bytes taken up by the objects themselves (depends very much on the type of object). Were I to split a string into ""words"" and stuff these into an array, the length of that array in *any* language corresponds not to the number of bytes in the string, but the number of words.  In fact, it's hard to think of anywhere except C and filesystem APIs where the exact number of bits or bytes in an object is directly exposed to the developer. It may be strongly implied (byte arrays in Java, say), and the language spec may even say how large certain items are, but there's no equivalent to the ""length"" operation on a string for measuring bytes.  So it seems much more likely to me that string length as a measure of either code points or characters (and one that's broken when every string is assumed to be ASCII) than as a measure of bytes.",‚òÉ

t5_2tf4e,Cartesian_Duelist,1337228853,"""Creepy"" is often just a synonym for 'male sexual behaviour I find distasteful'. As men are required to be more rigid in their expression of sexuality, anything that goes outside of the norm is an affront to society. This includes breaking the typical heteronormative/patriarchal pattern of dating/flirting. Hell, the other day, this dude apologized profusely to my fiancee for being 'creepy' when he flirted while she danced, and he asked to buy her a drink, but found out she was engaged.  Women cannot be creepy because society has conditioned us to think that women cannot be threatening and are innately 'good' and merely act bad due to corruption, whereas men are innately 'bad', and expression of the more personal parts of their nature to society is 'dangerous' and likely with ulterior motive (i.e. THAT NICE‚Ñ¢ GUY IS JUST TRYING TO GET IN YOUR PANTS AND IS SECRETLY AN ASSHOLE), especially when that falls out of line of the rigid roles we've set out for men, or god forbid, men masturbating--PERHAPS WITH A TOY.   Of course, that also makes the line between what makes a woman and man 'creepy' woefully offset. A creepy woman to most is a stalker, someone who wants a celebrity's babies, mentally ill, or deranged. A woman going:  ""Fuck I'd love to see what his ass looks like stretched out.""  to a male gonewild poster would be seen by most as liberated, adventurous, and kinky, assuming they weren't prudes. A male does that, and it doesn't matter who views it, it's instantly creepy.   At the same time, a man who is *not* sexually forward in a situation that calls for it is also 'creepy'.

Take it with a grain of salt and remember, EVERYONE complains about their job sometimes even when they truly love their jobs and can't imagine doing anything else.  If I remember correctly, absolutely NONE of my coworkers and friends that work in IT (from executive VPs all the way down to basic tech support) decided that this was their chosen career path when they were in high school.  For example, my Sr Developer graduated with a Parks &amp; Recreation degree (I kid you not), my boss wanted to become a chemical engineer of some sort, I went to college for Public Relations. A common thread in all of our stories is that we chanced upon a job that was IT related and we found that we were *really* good at it.  My point is don't feel like it's the end of the world if you couldn't get a job as a sys admin. Who knows what kinds of great technologies will be available in the next 5, 10, 15 years that could be even more interesting than servers?   I also want to point out it's not entirely about hourly pay or base salary. You need to also factor in health benefits, 401k, paid vacation, any other freebies/perks. Then there's the office environment, is it a good place to work or is the atmosphere so toxic that people turn over every couple of months? A friend of mine left a toxic place and took a significant pay cut, he's so much happier. clif notes version: The bosses would throw 6-figure bonuses at him to entice him to perform even greater miracles on even shorter time/budgets, all the while threatening to fire him if he's over said time/budgets.

Its not about what is best, it is about making the best of the rules presented.  F1 is a puzzle, and you need to solve it.  The rules state the car can have more than one MGU.   This is the rule in regards to coupling the MGU and turbocharger:  &gt; 5.1.6 Pressure charging may only be effected by the use of a sole single stage compressor linked to a  sole single stage exhaust turbine by a common shaft parallel to the engine crankshaft and  within 25mm of the car centre line. An electrical motor generator (MGUH) may be directly  coupled to the same shaft.  Both the turbo and the crank can have their own MGU (MGUH/MGUK).  &gt;5.2.7 The MGUK may only recover energy from or give back energy to the car via its mechanical link  to the drive train. This mechanical link must be of fixed speed ratio to the engine crankshaft  and may be clutched. 2014 F1 Technical Regulations 22 / 77 14 July 2011  ¬© 2011 F√©d√©ration Internationale de l‚ÄôAutomobile   &gt;5.2.8 The MGUH may only recover energy from or give back energy to the car via its mechanical link  to the exhaust turbine of a pressure charging system. This mechanical link must be of fixed  speed ratio to the exhaust turbine and **may be clutched**  The cars only have one turbo, but are still going to be acting as a TC (Turbo Compound) motor in many ways.  In a TC engine, the second turbo scavenges either unused exhaust gasses, or unused energy from a shaft on the 1st turbo that drives the second.  They can be parallel, or series.  The MGUH will still scavenge unused energy from the turbo and feed it back into the engine mechanically.  Pretty cool stuff.  This is where I got the info, the rules.  Looking over the rules its hard to imagine everyone coming out with identical engines outside of basic configuration.  The power should be more instant now, and have a wider range of torque due to the turbo being able to make up for the lower torque in the lower revs.  Now the engine will do well in the lower revs, and as you said, start to see diminishing returns once about 10,500.  I've read a lot people think it will voluntarily redline at 12,000 just to give it more legs in some corners, giving the driver the choice to use the engine or the gears, possibly handy in DRS situations where there should not longer be issues of hitting the limiter.  Having less power is better than bouncing off a limiter.",¬©

t5_2qi58,v0lta_7,1337292674,"&gt; And if you see the 3 goals conceded by Barca against Chelsea, Real and Chelsea; all three came from the area where Abidal used to defend.  What? Abidal defends runs by left midfielders? (1st goal, Ramires's run). 2nd goal, yes, it was his position, but no left back would've stopped that run and/or finish. And how was Abidal not being there involved in the 3rd goal? It was a free bloody run from Torres with every Barcelona player near the Chelsea box due to the urgency of the situation.   You're simply saying stuff assuming I don't know what I'm talking about. Please research your matter carefully.  &gt;And it was clear that Xavi was playing with an injury to his Achilles.  No it wasn't.  &gt;And regarding strategy and so on, I personally don't believe it was nothing ingenious or resolute.  Do you mean to say it wasn't ingenious or resolute or that it was? I can't figure out if that is bad grammar or simply double negatives.  &gt;the only player that seem to give a fuck in Chelsea was Joe Cole  I...what? Mate I don't even know whether I should carry on this debate. Joe Cole left Chelsea FC as of 30th June 2010.  And every single player in the squad gave a fuck. Cech, still making great saves. Ashley Cole, probably THE most determined player out there. Our other defenders, facing a constant barrage of attacks and all of them playing out of position. Drogba and Lampard, seasoned veterans who would never even think of giving up. Ramires, who was one of the brightest out there. I can go on and on and on! Chelsea would've conceded 4-5 if they didn't give a fuck.  &gt;Then that one goal right before the halftime completely changed the mentality and after the penalty miss it almost looked like a given.  Are you kidding me? So you're saying that despite Barca being   1. in front of 95k of their own on their home ground   2. Playing against a team with no CBs   3. Playing against a team with 10 men    4. Having 50+ minutes to salvage the match    It was a *given* that they were going to lose? Is *that* all the mental strength 'The Best team in the World¬Æ' has? A squad composed of La Liga, CL, Euro, World Cup winners?   &gt;And worse then that Barca became guilty of the thing that haunted them all this season and that is the sense of complacency after scoring two goals.  And Chelsea took advantage of that complacency. Rightly so.  &gt;That played a decisive factor as I think.  So you're basically saying Barcelona is composed of weak minded players who give up at the slightest sign of trouble and become complacent at the slightest sign of a lead. ",¬Æ

t5_2qi58,proud2bnepali,1337298786,"&gt;What? Abidal defends runs by left midfielders? (1st goal, Ramires's run). 2nd goal, yes, it was his position, but no left back would've stopped that run and/or finish. And how was Abidal not being there involved in the 3rd goal? It was a free bloody run from Torres with every Barcelona player near the Chelsea box due to the urgency of the situation.  You sound surprised about this which means you do no watch as many Barca games in La Liga. Their greatest strength is their fluidity and without key players it can become their greatest weakness. In the first Chelsea goal, Xavi had to track back Ramires after Messi lost the ball in the center as Alves was nowhere near defense, Masche slipped but you could see Adriano still running behind Drogba. Now Adriano is just like Alves-who likes to play a lot more attacking and stays way higher then Abidal would have stayed. And Abidal believe it or not can be faster then Adriano and has much better positional awareness then Adriano. So that is why I said the first goal could've been prevented by Abidal's presence. By second goal I mean to say the Ronaldo goal that Barca conceded against Madrid, so apologies for the confusion. And the first Chelsea goal was a fuck up by Masche who forgot they were playing a three man defense when he came to get the ball off Lampard. To suggest no left back could have stopped that run and/or finish is simply your assumption and I won't say anything about it. Third goal was not intended in any discussion.  &gt;No it wasn't.  Xavi's Achilles tendon flared up around February and he rarely played full game or had the same intensity training. Right before the Madrid match they were not sure if he would start and the decision was made an hour or so ago when he played till the 70th minute. So he was nowhere near at his best in any of the games against Chelsea or the one against Madrid and he was rested until the last Liga game after the loss to Chelsea (about 2 and half weeks)  &gt;Do you mean to say it wasn't ingenious or resolute or that it was? I can't figure out if that is bad grammar or simply double negatives.  Both. The parking the bus strategy is nothing new. Switzerland used it against Spain, Mou's Inter against Barca or Chelsea against Barca or Arsenal against Barca or the lesser team in Liga or even the double trivote of Madrid against Barca. It was not resolute simply because Chelsea had to rely on Barca finishing badly rather than Chelsea being airtight. In terms of resoluteness, the display at SB on 2009 was much better because Barca simply had one shot on target which ended up being the goal or Inter at Camp Nou.   &gt;I...what? Mate I don't even know whether I should carry on this debate. Joe Cole left Chelsea FC as of 30th June 2010. And every single player in the squad gave a fuck. Cech, still making great saves. Ashley Cole, probably THE most determined player out there. Our other defenders, facing a constant barrage of attacks and all of them playing out of position. Drogba and Lampard, seasoned veterans who would never even think of giving up. Ramires, who was one of the brightest out there. I can go on and on and on! Chelsea would've conceded 4-5 if they didn't give a fuck.  Okey that was a honest mistake. So no need to freak out. I mean Ashley Cole and as I did not review the comment; it just slipped by. And what I mean by not giving a flying fuck was that after Terry was gone, Chelsea had lost their shape which lead to the second goal and then lead to the Ramires yellow (which he blamed on nerves) while Drogba simply kicked the ball towards the corner line when they had to restart play. And at one point, only Ashley Cole was trying to get the ball off the Barca player which made the ITV commentators to say that he seems to be the only game who has not lost it. But after the Ramires goal everybody gave a fuck of course. My reference was especially after the Terry red and the second Barca goal.  &gt;Are you kidding me? So you're saying that despite Barca being 1. in front of 95k of their own on their home ground 2. Playing against a team with no CBs 3. Playing against a team with 10 men 4. Having 50+ minutes to salvage the match It was a given that they were going to lose? Is that all the mental strength 'The Best team in the World¬Æ' has? A squad composed of La Liga, CL, Euro, World Cup winners?  1. The home crowd were completely subdued after the first Chelsea goal and after the miss by Leo, it was all panic rather than anything I have heard time and again from the crowd at Camp Nou (except for moments; when they knew it was inevitable, they even said Torres name) but fair enough.   2.3. Having no CBs did not really mattered much against Barca as they have no one player who stays in the middle of the box waiting for a long ball against or takes shots from outside the box. Having a player like Bosingwa who is agile actually helped and in any case, when Drogba becomes one of the defenders along with 10 fit and determined players who simply want to hoof the ball away, it clearly becomes a disadvantage against team like Barca. Again Chelsea did what they have to do, but this is what teams have been doing all along and sometimes it works, sometimes does not.  4. Technically they did create the chance which led to a penalty but then Leo hit the post. After that it was 25 minutes to salvage the game, Leo hit the post again around the end.   The given was part of my observation and nothing to do with the mental strength/weakness of the Barca team. The reason I came to the conclusion is many but the main ones were the way they conceded the first goal and the lack of run from Messi after the penalty miss as well as the constant pass-back between Xavi and Busi (who completed more passes between them in the second half then the whole Chelsea team passes over the game). And with the lack of goal threat from anyone except Leo and Leo not making those runs and then hitting the post were some reasons that led me to the conclusion. They looked exhausted (which they were physically as they had 2 days rest) as well as mentally.   &gt;So you're basically saying Barcelona is composed of weak minded players who give up at the slightest sign of trouble and become complacent at the slightest sign of a lead.  No I am not 'basically saying' that Barca players have are psychological weak. They have been guilty of complacency at certain points during the season which Pep and the players as well as observers have noticed possibly because except the failure against Inter, they really had not faced another epic failure under Pep. So they seemed to be lacking the urgency and simply could not give as much as they would have done if they had not won the CL twice already (which the Chelsea players showed). That may be simply due to the complete exhaustion or lack of ideas in breaking down the 10 men wall while hitting the post/missing penalties. That does play a factor when your team has 27 odd SOT and can score only two while the opponent has 2 from 5 odd SOT. And I assume a team that has come from the behind many times against teams like RM to beat them is not that psychologically weak.   You seem to be thinking I am taking the due credit away from Chelsea. I am not. But I have no qualms in stating that I will not be over the moon if Argentina plays such football even if they win the world cup that way. For most people winning is the only thing that matters, for me the process matters equally. If Chelsea FC is proud of the identity of winning by any means necessary, good for them. The reason I loved the Barca UNDER Pep was that they always played on their terms and the process was equally important as the victory as he stated time and time again.   So to somehow suggest Barca were handed their ass on platter while even when they were loosing is an overstatement. That is all.",¬Æ

t5_2qi6d,johnny2k,1337320255,"It would help to know what you ride but here's some stuff that helped me on my single-cylinder 650.   Most importantly, you want to make sure all the nuts and bolts are torqued correctly. Loose parts will do a lot to add vibration. A pair of gel grips will also be the first thing you want to pick up if you haven't already done that. My hands used to go numb after a while with the stock grips. This no longer happens thanks to the 1000 pennies I spent. Always wear gloves. Always wear gloves. If, by chance, you ride a KLR you can reduce vibrations by upgrading to a larger piston. This is an added benefit to the solution for curing the oil consumption problem of the '08 and newer machines. There are handle bars that can help with this as well but I know nothing about the options available or what to look for. Mine are still stock.   All the advice you're getting from us is aimed to make sure the resonant frequency of your handle bars is not the same as the engine when at certain RPMs. You mentioned a speed at which you feel it the most. Maybe try to ride at a lower speed but with the same RPM to test this? If that doesn't prove anything maybe it indicates you have a wheel that is unbalanced? Mine was all janked up once so any speed over 55 was like riding a giant Rabbit¬Æ. Have you run your tires at a low air pressure recently? That is what caused mine to become unbalanced.  Check out this article I dug up with my ""resonant frequency motorcycle vibration"" shovel.

t5_2s593,MacAny,1337324240,"To the man and woman who chose to conceive a child, the result of which was me, when it fit in with their five year plan;  To the teachers who never really cared, no matter what they say;  To my fellow geeks, dweebs, et. al., who will no doubt receive more abuse upon my passing, as my tormentors will no longer have me to kick around;   To my fellow students who made my life a living nightmare when they should have focused on their education;  To those who never cared, never spoke, probably never knew my name; To the one true friend, whose caring was the only thing that prevented this even from happening sooner;  To the God, if he does exist, who chose to play a cruel, cruel joke on me when he placed me where he did and surrounded me with so many uncaring faces;  To all of you, goodbye.  I am leaving a world to which I never truly belonged or fit in. Do not weep for me, or mourn my passing. I say this not because I expect to be missed, but to allow those who truly did not care go on with their lives with a clean conscience and dry eyes. I know you don't want to weep for me. So don't. But I do ask you to listen to the final words of a young man who has taken charge of his own destiny.   Perhaps my parents might feel something inside which causes them to shed tears. They may pretend that it's sorrow for their ""loss"", but I hope it is something else. Perhaps sorrow for bringing a child into this world when they really didn't have the time or desire to raise him. I wasn't the product of love, born of a desire to prepare another human being to grow and lead the human race. I was merely the next acquisition, the next task, the next project on their list of things that bring significance.   No child should be brought into this world for the mere purpose of being just another possession. I am not an asset to be cataloged and listed on your tax forms beside your house and car, or fought over during your divorce proceedings. I am a human being. I'm sorry that it took this to make you realize that. If you don't yet get it, then I'm even sorrier.   What about my teachers? Will they be sorry to see another student become a statistic? Certainly the administration and Principal Chowning will mourn, as my death will not reflect well on them as an institution. Well, I apologize for making the statistics for your administration worse. But I don't expect an apology for the false sympathies of people like Mrs. Dunfee, and the broken promises of others like Mr. Richman.   As for my fellows students, those who made a more significant impact on my life, I know better than to expect my tormentors to mourn.  But if I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m going to address those who belittled me, I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d be remiss if I failed to include the ladies in my life. I guess that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not entirely accurate, as the ones I refer to fall in two basic categories: those who refused to be in my life, and those who I would rather have excluded from my life. In the former category, Melinda Tunney, Jessica Silvers, and dear Kimmy Vanover, whose laughed in my face after I asked her to the homecoming dance, humiliating me in front of I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know how many other classmates. In the latter category are too many to mention, though I must single out Rebecca Cull and Vanessa Dietrich for their tremendous dedication to the cause of destroying any shred of self-esteem I might dare to foster. Why can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t you accept the things that make other people different rather than insisting everyone conforms to your will?   Sure, some did offer friendly gestures. Nicole Edwards often would greet me and ask about my life. Not that I ever felt comfortable enough to tell her anything; I never trusted her enough to give her the chance. What was the purpose? Did you really give a flip about the shy, quiet kid who sat behind you in 8th grade history? Or was it all about creating an illusion that you care, just to guarantee my voting for you as a class officer.   I can only conceive of one person in this world who will truly be sad at my parting. Marty, my best friend, you talked me out of this decision three times before. You even called 911 after I swallowed a bottle of pills. That is why I did not tell you anything this time, and why I do this in secret, alone. I wish you were coming with me on this great adventure, into the final frontier. Where ever I go, yours will be the one face I carry with me. The one soul I will miss. Yours is also the only forgiveness I ask and beg for as I depart from this life. I love you, and always will.  There√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s another group I have not yet addressed: those not like me who left me alone. Or I should say ignored me. I appreciate your sparing me any further harassment, but your inaction, your withheld hellos and how are yous did more to hurt than any name calling. Your inaction effectively excluded me from student life, from the human race. You left me isolated and alone, and no words I could say can convey to you the suffering you caused. I could name names, but in doing so, I would do more now for you than you ever did for me in life.   I do not know if what awaits me at the end of this gun. Will there be a void? Or will I come face to face with God? I just don't care any more. If you're anything like your people, I wouldn't want to know you. You preached to love one another, yet I've felt everything except love from Christians. Even if I could know you were different, well, I still reject you. You have left your ""followers"" to treat people like me poorly. You have allowed so many of the people you ""love"", including me, to suffer. So you want me to trust you with my life? I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want to spend eternity with a careless deity like you, or with the company you keep.   As my final moments tick away, I wonder what impact these words will create. It depends first on this web site being found, as I doubt whether school administration will want such venom spoken publicly about their lack of caring. Still, the Internet is a remarkable place where even the least significant individual can be heard. Will anyone listen? Will anyone take action? Will students pause and pay attention to the hurting hearts around them? And even if they do, will it be a temporary salve for their egos, to convince themselves they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re really not bad people√¢‚Ç¨¬¶ or will real change happen?   My heart certainly goes out to my fellow outsiders. With me gone, some of you will certainly feel more of the pain and hurt that I did. No one understands you. No one cares how your day is going. No one bothers to get to know you as anything more than a nerd, a geek, a loser. You can do nothing for their social status, save the occasional boost to the ego they get from putting you in your place. Some of you, like Andy Riker, will find outlets in writing. Some, like James Moon, will have an escape in art. Some, like Sean Gilbert, will live their lives pursuing unicorns that they will never, ever catch. I never had a talent to lose myself in, or a dream or unicorn to chase, and so I have taken the path most dreaded. Some of you may soon join me, and I look forward to welcoming a brother or sister to the land where you will never suffer the loneliness and rejection that faces you now.  Farewell forever. I am going to another place. Where, I do not know. But logic dictates that it can only be an improvement. Perhaps my passing will only prove a footnote in a school yearbook. Then again, perhaps the sacrifice of one might bring hope to others. If my death makes life for one person a little more bearable, or a little more enlightened, do I really die in vain?

They make their money from macbooks, ipads, etc.   Mac sells an OS, for about half or 1/3rd the price of windows, but they aren't trying to seriously compete with MS in the OS arena, it's locked to mac hardware and isn't intended to be installed elsewhere.

t5_2cneq,Whalid,1337354597,"Sure:  THREE and a half years ago, on my 62nd birthday, doctors discovered a mass on my pancreas. It turned out to be Stage 3 pancreatic cancer. I was told I would be dead in four to six months. Today I am in that rare coterie of people who have survived this long with the disease. But I did not foresee that after having dedicated myself for 40 years to a life of the law, including more than two decades as a New York State judge, my quest for ameliorative and palliative care would lead me to marijuana.  My survival has demanded an enormous price, including months of chemotherapy, radiation hell and brutal surgery. For about a year, my cancer disappeared, only to return. About a month ago, I started a new and even more debilitating course of treatment. Every other week, after receiving an IV booster of chemotherapy drugs that takes three hours, I wear a pump that slowly injects more of the drugs over the next 48 hours.  Nausea and pain are constant companions. One struggles to eat enough to stave off the dramatic weight loss that is part of this disease. Eating, one of the great pleasures of life, has now become a daily battle, with each forkful a small victory. Every drug prescribed to treat one problem leads to one or two more drugs to offset its side effects. Pain medication leads to loss of appetite and constipation. Anti-nausea medication raises glucose levels, a serious problem for me with my pancreas so compromised. Sleep, which might bring respite from the miseries of the day, becomes increasingly elusive.  Inhaled marijuana is the only medicine that gives me some relief from nausea, stimulates my appetite, and makes it easier to fall asleep. The oral synthetic substitute, Marinol, prescribed by my doctors, was useless. Rather than watch the agony of my suffering, friends have chosen, at some personal risk, to provide the substance. I find a few puffs of marijuana before dinner gives me ammunition in the battle to eat. A few more puffs at bedtime permits desperately needed sleep.  This is not a law-and-order issue; it is a medical and a human rights issue. Being treated at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, I am receiving the absolute gold standard of medical care. But doctors cannot be expected to do what the law prohibits, even when they know it is in the best interests of their patients. When palliative care is understood as a fundamental human and medical right, marijuana for medical use should be beyond controversy.  Sixteen states already permit the legitimate clinical use of marijuana, including our neighbor New Jersey, and Connecticut is on the cusp of becoming No. 17. The New York State Legislature is now debating a bill to recognize marijuana as an effective and legitimate medicinal substance and establish a lawful framework for its use. The Assembly has passed such bills before, but they went nowhere in the State Senate. This year I hope that the outcome will be different. Cancer is a nonpartisan disease, so ubiquitous that it‚Äôs impossible to imagine that there are legislators whose families have not also been touched by this scourge. It is to help all who have been affected by cancer, and those who will come after, that I now speak.  Given my position as a sitting judge still hearing cases, well-meaning friends question the wisdom of my coming out on this issue. But I recognize that fellow cancer sufferers may be unable, for a host of reasons, to give voice to our plight. It is another heartbreaking aporia in the world of cancer that the one drug that gives relief without deleterious side effects remains classified as a narcotic with no medicinal value.  Because criminalizing an effective medical technique affects the fair administration of justice, I feel obliged to speak out as both a judge and a cancer patient suffering with a fatal disease. I implore the governor and the Legislature of New York, always considered a leader among states, to join the forward and humane thinking of 16 other states and pass the medical marijuana bill this year. Medical science has not yet found a cure, but it is barbaric to deny us access to one substance that has proved to ameliorate our suffering.  Gustin L. Reichbach is a justice of the State Supreme Court in Brooklyn.√Ç   A version of this op-ed appeared in print on May 17, 2012, on page A27 of the New York edition with the headline: A Judge√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s Plea for Pot.",‚Ñ¢

You guys are not married, although that doesn't always make a difference, have only been together for one year, and if something were to happen to the relationship, it would be your name on the mortgage and you being forced to make the payments. A good thought to go by in determining how much house you can afford is to figure out what 3 years of your salary would be, and by my calculations, 3 years of your salary alone would be $240,000.  You guys should talk to your bank because they probably wouldn't finance you even with the large down payment, because of student loans, not being at the job very long, not much established credit, and things like that. I strongly advise young people not to buy a house on a mortgage because of those reasons. It would be an entirely different story if you were able to buy the house with cash. You can pm me if you have any other questions, and I will try my best to be of some help. Good luck",¬Æ

The neighbour moved them at max. two days old (because he thought his own cat might harm them), which is always a *bad* thing to do. He just dumped them on my brother's doorstep and he looked after them until I volunteered to step in. Coincidentally, me and the boyfriend were planning to get rescue cats within the month.  The Momma cat comes into my brother's yard sometimes and they tried to coax her back but have had no luck, so that is why my brother made the decision to move them to my house. The vet I talked to today said that once they are moved, Momma is unlikely to come back :(  Today's update: Brought them to the vet to see if we were taking care of them properly, to check their weight etc. The vet was very happy with how we've looked after them and they're at the weight that they should be! She did say there's a 50/50 survival rate with hand-reared cats BUT she is quietly confident that they will make it because they are currently thriving. They could still come down with an infection and not make it but she said they're very likely to survive once they reach 2 and a half weeks (9-10 days time).

t5_2r9vp,IAmTheOracle,1337399422,"THREE and a half years ago, on my 62nd birthday, doctors discovered a mass on my pancreas. It turned out to be Stage 3 pancreatic cancer. I was told I would be dead in four to six months. Today I am in that rare coterie of people who have survived this long with the disease. But I did not foresee that after having dedicated myself for 40 years to a life of the law, including more than two decades as a New York State judge, my quest for ameliorative and palliative care would lead me to marijuana.  My survival has demanded an enormous price, including months of chemotherapy, radiation hell and brutal surgery. For about a year, my cancer disappeared, only to return. About a month ago, I started a new and even more debilitating course of treatment. Every other week, after receiving an IV booster of chemotherapy drugs that takes three hours, I wear a pump that slowly injects more of the drugs over the next 48 hours.  Nausea and pain are constant companions. One struggles to eat enough to stave off the dramatic weight loss that is part of this disease. Eating, one of the great pleasures of life, has now become a daily battle, with each forkful a small victory. Every drug prescribed to treat one problem leads to one or two more drugs to offset its side effects. Pain medication leads to loss of appetite and constipation. Anti-nausea medication raises glucose levels, a serious problem for me with my pancreas so compromised. Sleep, which might bring respite from the miseries of the day, becomes increasingly elusive.  Inhaled marijuana is the only medicine that gives me some relief from nausea, stimulates my appetite, and makes it easier to fall asleep. The oral synthetic substitute, Marinol, prescribed by my doctors, was useless. Rather than watch the agony of my suffering, friends have chosen, at some personal risk, to provide the substance. I find a few puffs of marijuana before dinner gives me ammunition in the battle to eat. A few more puffs at bedtime permits desperately needed sleep.  This is not a law-and-order issue; it is a medical and a human rights issue. Being treated at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, I am receiving the absolute gold standard of medical care. But doctors cannot be expected to do what the law prohibits, even when they know it is in the best interests of their patients. When palliative care is understood as a fundamental human and medical right, marijuana for medical use should be beyond controversy.  Sixteen states already permit the legitimate clinical use of marijuana, including our neighbor New Jersey, and Connecticut is on the cusp of becoming No. 17. The New York State Legislature is now debating a bill to recognize marijuana as an effective and legitimate medicinal substance and establish a lawful framework for its use. The Assembly has passed such bills before, but they went nowhere in the State Senate. This year I hope that the outcome will be different. Cancer is a nonpartisan disease, so ubiquitous that it‚Äôs impossible to imagine that there are legislators whose families have not also been touched by this scourge. It is to help all who have been affected by cancer, and those who will come after, that I now speak.  Given my position as a sitting judge still hearing cases, well-meaning friends question the wisdom of my coming out on this issue. But I recognize that fellow cancer sufferers may be unable, for a host of reasons, to give voice to our plight. It is another heartbreaking aporia in the world of cancer that the one drug that gives relief without deleterious side effects remains classified as a narcotic with no medicinal value.  Because criminalizing an effective medical technique affects the fair administration of justice, I feel obliged to speak out as both a judge and a cancer patient suffering with a fatal disease. I implore the governor and the Legislature of New York, always considered a leader among states, to join the forward and humane thinking of 16 other states and pass the medical marijuana bill this year. Medical science has not yet found a cure, but it is barbaric to deny us access to one substance that has proved to ameliorate our suffering.  Gustin L. Reichbach is a justice of the State Supreme Court in Brooklyn.√Ç   A version of this op-ed appeared in print on May 17, 2012, on page A27 of the New York edition with the headline: A Judge√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s Plea for Pot.

Only people in privileged positions have it easy, and sometimes that privilege can even backfire on them in the case of men and child custody cases, for example.  The people you should be comparing yourself to are the hetero-normative folks who think their sexual preference affords them the privilege of having actual questionable behavior like objectifying women go unchallenged while simultaneously feeling they can pass judgement or evaluate your personal experiences without even needing to research it at all.

You're looking at i5 procssing, 1T Hard drive, NVIDIA¬Æ GeForce¬Æ GT 525M 1GB GPU, 6 Cell Battery, and it has a backlit keyboard, which is great for students.

t5_2qh61,Kanilas,1337487821,"&gt; I can't even fathom how you could put the difficulties of being an atheist on the same level as the ones most Muslims face.  [‚úî] Religion and law  It's the same fight, just different sides of it. In America, atheists are trying to keep the law secular, and free of religious influence. Muslims have to deal with the same sort of laws impinging on their religion, since the fervent backers of religious based laws are typically backing the Christian point-of-view, at least in the US.  [‚úî] Stereotypes  Muslims have to deal with being associated with terrorists, because of their religious practices, and their skin color. That, and the misconception about jihad, and taking over America. Atheists deal with the same kind of misguided hate from the right, with people complaining of a liberal secularist takeover of our schools. Both can be considered as 'hating America' and that they should 'get out of our country'.  [‚úî] Lack of acceptance  In 2006, according to a PEW Research Survey, 55% of Americans held a favorable opinion of Muslims. 35% were favorable of Atheists. Families have been torn asunder either for conversion to another religion, like Islam, or losing faith in the religion of the family. Compared to Christianity, both Islam and a lack of religion are sorely underrepresented in the US Congress, with the two sitting at a combined 1% of representation in the Congress, while nearly 18% of Americans are either Muslim, or not spiritual.   Yes, there are some big differences between the two. And while I don't pray to any atheist god, or attend atheist group meetings like religious people do, there're the exact same kind of discrimination from the majority in the US. Depending on where you are, it can be better or worse, but it's out there.",‚úî

t5_2qh2p,Dudesan,1337546328,"I've heard many christians claim that there's a distinction between ""moral, civil, and ceremonial laws"", but not one **has ever** been able to give me a straight answer about how they tell the difference between the three. It's all about what they find personally distasteful or silly.  Apart from a few commands which were explicitly intended for a specific people at a specific time, there is absolutely nothing to indicate that most of these laws weren't supposed to be binding for everyone for all time.  Remember, many Christians find it more comfortable to believe in a god who doesn't condone, command or commit murder, slavery, rape, child abuse, animal abuse, arson, torture, ritual mutilation, fratricide, patricide, matricide, infanticide, genocide, and so on than to believe in one who does. Unfortunately, since the Bible (Old Testamant and New) is pretty clear about Yahweh's position on these things, holding a belief in Loving Hippie Jesus‚Ñ¢ requires ignoring huge portions of it. Or just never reading it in the first place, which seems to be the most popular option.  Well, let's say what Jesus has to say about that:  &gt;‚ÄúDo not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished.  (Matthew 5:17-18, NIV)  Some Christians claim that his death and resurrection ""fulfill"" this. That is bullshit for one simple reason: last time I checked, Heaven and Earth haven't passed away.  Jesus also made his views on people ""picking and choosing"" quite clear:  &gt;[Jesus] answered them, ‚ÄúAnd why do you break God‚Äôs commandment because of your tradition? For God said:    *Honor your father and your mother;* and, *The one who speaks evil of father or mother must be put to death.*  &gt; But you say, ‚ÄòWhoever tells his father or mother, ‚ÄúWhatever benefit you might have received from me is a gift committed to the temple‚Äù‚Äî  he does not have to honor his father.‚Äô In this way, you have revoked God‚Äôs word because of your tradition. Hypocrites! Isaiah prophesied correctly about you when he said:    &gt;These people honor Me with their lips, but their heart is far from Me.  They worship Me in vain, teaching as doctrines the commands of men.‚Äù  (Matthew 15:3-9, NIV)   Looks like Jesus has quite a bit to say about people who ignore commandments, in fact. But maybe it's just Matthew?  &gt;It is easier for heaven and earth to disappear than for the least stroke of a pen to drop out of the Law.  (Luke 16:17, NIV)  Okay, so Jesus is a bust. Let's see what the Epistles have to say about the Mosaic Code:  &gt; If you really keep the royal law found in Scripture, ‚ÄúLove your neighbor as yourself,‚Äù you are doing right.  But if you show favoritism, you sin and are convicted by the law as lawbreakers. For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it.   (James 2:8-10, NIV)  &gt;All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness,  (2 Timothy 3:16)  &gt;Do we, then, nullify the law by this faith? Not at all! Rather, we uphold the law.  (Romans 3:31)  Well, shit.   This problem disappears quite quickly if you assert that most of the Bible is hogwash, and you only care about the good parts. If you prefer to cling to it as an inspired document, vague mutterings about ""context"" or about Jesus abolishing the old Law won't get you anywhere.  ",‚Ñ¢

t5_2qh33,Maxfunky,1337554068,"I concur. What's wrong with plain old facts like we had back in my day.  Consider these hand-crafted nuggets of truth:  * If you were to take every McDonald's happy meal toy ever made and line them up end to end, you would have wasted your life. * A walrus is neither a pea, nor a nut. * The cheeseburger was named in honor of its inventor, Simon R. Cheese. * You can calculate the distance of the earth to the sun by attaching a really long tape measure to an object traveling at the earth's escape velocity. * The longest internet outage in recorded history lasted for thousands of years, and didn't end until the 1960's. * A submission is neither a sub nor a mission. * Time, if consumed in significant quantities, is fatal for all life forms.  Thyme, however, is only toxic to dogs.  * A 70 year-long study at the University of Cambridge published in 2006 hightlights the dangers of oxygen.   In the study, 1 in 5 babies exposed to oxygen on a daily basis eventually died of cancer.  None of the babies not exposed to oxygen, however, died of cancer.  Surprisingly, oxygen deprivation also proved to be an effective tool against weight gain. * Subsequent to the invention of irony in 1994, Flannel shirts saw a 6400% increase in sales. * According to legend, Greek mathematician Euclid created the entire branch of mathematics known as Geometry in an attempt to contest a parking ticket.  And while I'm at it, here are some from an another thread that nobody ever really saw:  * The Skittles slogan ""Taste the Rainbow"" replaced the much maligned previous slogan ""Suck on these."" * Noted salad-enthusiast Julius Caesar was, according to popular legend, warned by a soothsayer to ""beware of a senatorial plot to stab you 23 times on the ides of march"" but brashly dismissed the warning as a ""bunch of oddly-specific superstitious hogwash."" * The color purple was discovered in 1943 by Sir Edward Purple. *  Scientists have discovered a gene that gives people immunity to ovarian cancer and greatly reduced risk of breast cancer.  It's called SRY and its located on the Y-chromosome.  Side effects include facial hair growth, increased muscle mass, and higher pay for the same job. * The best boxer in history was Calvin Theodore Hall.  He retired undefeated (67-0) without anyone having ever landed a single punch on him.  Thus the common expression: ""You can't fight C.T. Hall."" * Marshmallow Mutts‚Ñ¢, the hot dogs with the marshmallow creme center, sadly do not exist.  They are not a product of the Oscar Mayer Foods Corporation and if you ask your local grocer for them, you will only receive blank stares instead of *""The sweet meat treat you long to eat.*‚Ñ¢""  If they existed, you could enjoy them with new Cinnamon-Sugar Pastry buns and Caramel Condiment, but they don't--so you can't.  Warn your friends. * Sir Francis Bacon is best known for discovering eggs. * The average ice cream is more than 50% air by volume--except ""Light"" ice creams, which use helium instead.   ",‚Ñ¢

t5_2qh61,WaylonCanDoThat,1337564466,"[‚úî] Religion and law    Well put. I would argue that atheists aren't the only people trying to keep the law secular, though. Many, I would guess the majority on personal experiences but could be wrong, religious people favor separation of church and state and would support the same types thing an atheist would. I think it's more of a ""the loud religious right vs. the rest of America"" than it is ""Christians vs. atheists"".    [‚úî] Stereotypes    Both have to deal with the same misguided hate for the right, yes. So does just about anybody who they feel doesn't agree with them. Post 9/11 Muslims had to deal with misguided hate from people from nearly every end of the religious/nonreligious spectrum, atheists included. Almost every black comedian had their own version of the ""thank you Muslims"" joke about how it was better to be black than Muslim. A lot of that initial hate has waned, but it is still there. It might be the same ""kind of hate"" but that doesn't make it equal.    [‚úî] Lack of acceptance    Good points. Don't really have anything to add.    It can also depend on whether or not an atheist views being an atheist as a defining characteristic. Somebody who when describing themselves would say ""I am an atheist"" as one of the first things would probably perceive having much more difficulty than somebody who wouldn't even think the mention being atheist which is why I liked ilivedinacake's ""Atheist vs. atheist"" distinction.

t5_2qhk3,C0CKPUNCHER,1337623151,"  #5 Ali provides examples that misidentify strengths as weaknesses Ali uses the example of how women place a smiley face next to a serious question as evidence that women are ‚Äúreducing the impact of having to express their true feelings.‚Äù How is it that expressing an issue or concern should not be done in a gentle way? If a woman or a man includes a smiley face next to a texted comment or concern, it indicates that they are not speaking from an entrenched reactive position but are instead receptive to dialogue.  Not only is this conducive to discussing the issue in a constructive way, it is the kind of skill set that can grow a more viable personal, business or social relationship. And it‚Äôs a skill set we should all be applying more often. It can be considered to be coming from a constructionist approach to communication. Ali‚Äôs use of this example as evidence of oppression is potentially chauvinistic in its way, because he privileges a style of communication that is blunt and unapologetic, a typically ‚Äúmale‚Äù style of communication.  #6 Ali‚Äôs article encourages counterproductive binary arguments The men in his article are two dimensional bullies that show no capacity for compassion or empathy. It makes for heightened drama and a great third act, but Ali is not writing entertainment. He is attempting to address real and painful social ills. And he is doing so in a way that is ultimately not helpful to men and women alike. We know that men are not two dimensional villains from the silver screen. Men are highly emotional creatures with vast capacities to love and be loved. Men can be spiritual healers and primary parents. They can be loving partners and caring teachers. And in all these roles, they encourage men and women alike to explore and share their emotions, to communicate their challenges and air their grievances.  ‚ô¶‚óä‚ô¶  Thank you, Yashar. I know your heart is in the right place I want to say clearly that yes, there are far too many female victims of silencing and abuse in the world. One person dealing with abuse is too many. But it is crucial to our ongoing dialogues to understand that the victims of abuse are men and women alike. It‚Äôs a fact that women have the potential to be just as emotionally and physically abusive as men. For some insight, look at the CDC‚Äôs statistics on physical abuse in relationships by gender. The report states: ‚ÄúMore than 1 in 3 women (35.6%) and more than 1 in 4 men (28.5%) in the United States have experienced rape, physical violence, and/or stalking by an intimate partner in their lifetime.‚Äù(1)  Yashar Ali has tapped into a major issue in our culture. He‚Äôs right that many women feel suppressed and devalued by people they work and live with. All of this is true. Ali has managed to create some powerful emotional resonance with his article. But it is important that we talk about what is happening between men and women in a holistic way. It is also important that we stay current in how we frame societal ills, so that we don‚Äôt devalue the progress that men and woman have created in partnership up to this point. So that we don‚Äôt drop back twenty years and pick up a more combative dialogue and bring it forward to now.  What can be immensely helpful instead, is to view these issues through the lens of what is called Appreciative Inquiry. Simply stated, we look for what is working and grow that, versus only pointing out the negative and attempting to eliminate it. Real progress has been made in terms of how men and women address emotions in their relationships. If we fail to acknowledge that, our actions do little to engage and grow successful trending change. Furthermore, appreciative inquiry teaches us to look for common ground and to be curious about ways we can support each other as we go forward in conversations like this one.  I fully understand there is work to be done. Holding someone else‚Äôs emotions can be frightening and destabilizing. Especially if we have no models for doing it in our lives or our families of origin. But we can learn how. We and our partners have to help each other learn how.  ‚ô¶‚óä‚ô¶  In my personal relationship, my wife and I are working to develop these kinds of emotion-holding skills. And top among them for me is the capacity to hear others‚Äô emotions and not immediately try and ‚Äúfix it‚Äù or in some way solve the problem. Instead, I‚Äôm learning to just listen and hear. For me, as a man, this is huge. The gift of the act of listening, decoupled from immediately REACTING can create a holding space for the emotions of others. Often, men like me will immediately focus on the source of the problem in an effort to eliminate the resulting uncomfortable emotions. There are times when focusing on fixing things is easier than experiencing our partner‚Äôs or our children‚Äôs pain or sadness. But the fact is, we human beings need to share our emotions. Fixing the problem can come later. When men (and women) learn to develop skills like this, it can go a long way to eliminating gaslighting. Because it creates the kind of emotional literacy that allows all of us to express ourselves more fully.  ‚ÄúStop feeling that way‚Äù becomes ‚Äúits okay that you feel that way‚Äù. And the oxygen of life and love reenters the room.",‚ô¶

t5_2qstm,bltst2,1337634026,"This took me like 5 mins to gather.  I'm an active investor but when it game to long term, retirement investing I was out of my league.  My company offered Financial Engines ([https://www.financialengines.com](https://www.financialengines.com)) as part of our 401K service and I've never been happier.  For a small service fee, they analyze, balance and make changes to my 401K automatically.  I'm seeing ROI of about 12% right now (3 years).  If you want to go at it alone, your choices need to reflect your anticipated retirement date, risk and goals.  You generally want a mixture of stocks (small and large), bonds, international and cash.  Here is what you own:  **Artisan Mid Cap Value Fund** -- long-term capital growth by investing in undervalued, medium-sized U.S. companies  **BlackRock International Index Fund** -- The investment seeks match the performance of the MSCI EAFE Index (Europe, Australasia, Far East) in U.S. dollars with net dividends as closely as possible before the deduction of fund expenses.  **FFI Treasury Fund** -- The fund‚Äôs objective is to seek current income consistent with liquidity and security of principal by investing in a portfolio of securities that are direct obligations of the US Treasury.  **Goldman Sachs Growth Opportunities** -- The investment seeks long-term growth of capital. The fund normally invests at least 90% of assets in equity securities with a primary focus on mid-cap companies. It primarily invests in publicly traded U.S. securities. The fund may also invest up to 25% of assets in foreign securities, including securities of issuers in emerging countries and securities quoted in foreign currencies.  **MFS¬Æ Emerging Markets Equity Fund**  -- The portfolio invests in stocks of emerging market companies around the world. This fund has the flexibility to invest across sectors, countries, and market capitalizations.  **Templeton Global Total Return Fund** -- Seeks total investment return consisting of a combination of interest income, capital appreciation, and currency gains. The fund's manager strategically allocates assets across fixed income markets around the world by tapping the expertise of the 100-plus investment professionals that compose the Franklin Templeton Fixed Income Group.  **Vanguard Short-Term Bond Index Fund Investor Shares** -- This index fund offers a low-cost, diversified approach to bond investing, providing broad exposure to U.S. investment-grade bonds with maturities from one to five years. Reflecting this goal, the fund invests about 30% of assets in corporate bonds and 70% in U.S. government bonds within that maturity range. A key risk of the fund is the fact that changes in interest rates can eventually lead to a decrease in income for the fund. Investors with a short-term savings goal who are willing to accept some price movement may wish to consider this fund.   **Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund Investor Shares** -- This fund is designed to provide broad exposure to U.S. investment grade bonds. Reflecting this goal, the fund invests about 30% in corporate bonds and 70% in U.S. government bonds of all maturities (short-, intermediate-, and long-term issues). As with other bond funds, one of the risks of the fund is that increases in interest rates may cause the price of the bonds in the portfolio to decrease‚Äîpricing the fund‚Äôs NAV lower. Because the fund invests in all segments and maturities of the fixed income market, investors may consider the fund their core bond holding.",¬Æ

t5_2qh16,Bluest_waters,1337657037,"There are two possible reasons the disease keeps coming back for you. The first is that the bacteria is shape shifting into the cyst form in order to avoid being destroyed, the second is that it's hiding behind biofilm  You can feel 100% perfectly fine and yet still have the lyme  bacteria hibernating behind biofilm just biding its time to come back out  Tell your doctor to hook you up with some  tinidazole, this is by far the most effective antibiotic against the bacteria. Any really good doctor knows if the disease keeps coming back you need to switch it up and use different antibiotics.  Also‚Ä¶ Google ""bicillin + lyme""    http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21753890   Abstract BACKGROUND: Lyme disease is a tick-borne illness caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi. Although antibiotic therapy is usually effective early in the disease, relapse may occur when administration of antibiotics is discontinued. Studies have suggested that resistance and recurrence of Lyme disease might be due to formation of different morphological forms of B. burgdorferi, namely round bodies (cysts) and biofilm-like colonies. Better understanding of the effect of antibiotics on all morphological forms of B. burgdorferi is therefore crucial to provide effective therapy for Lyme disease. METHODS: Three morphological forms of B. burgdorferi (spirochetes, round bodies, and biofilm-like colonies) were generated using novel culture methods. Minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration of five antimicrobial agents (doxycycline, amoxicillin, tigecycline, metronidazole, and tinidazole) against spirochetal forms of B. burgdorferi were evaluated using the standard published microdilution technique. The susceptibility of spirochetal and round body forms to the antibiotics was then tested using fluorescent microscopy (BacLight‚Ñ¢ viability staining) and dark field microscopy (direct cell counting), and these results were compared with the microdilution technique. Qualitative and quantitative effects of the antibiotics against biofilm-like colonies were assessed using fluorescent microscopy and dark field microscopy, respectively. RESULTS: Doxycycline reduced spirochetal structures ‚àº90% but increased the number of round body forms about twofold. Amoxicillin reduced spirochetal forms by ‚àº85%-90% and round body forms by ‚àº68%, while treatment with metronidazole led to reduction of spirochetal structures by ‚àº90% and round body forms by ‚àº80%. Tigecycline and tinidazole treatment reduced both spirochetal and round body forms by ‚àº80%-90%. When quantitative effects on biofilm-like colonies were evaluated, the five antibiotics reduced formation of these colonies by only 30%-55%. In terms of qualitative effects, only tinidazole reduced viable organisms by ‚àº90%. Following treatment with the other antibiotics, viable organisms were detected in 70%-85% of the biofilm-like colonies. CONCLUSION: Antibiotics have varying effects on the different morphological forms of B. burgdorferi. Persistence of viable organisms in round body forms and biofilm-like colonies may explain treatment failure and persistent symptoms following antibiotic therapy of Lyme disease.",‚Ñ¢

DEA agents photographed and fingerprinted Prieto over his objections, then released him without charging him with anything.  &gt;Border Patrol agents searched his truck with drug-sniffing dogs, but found no evidence of illegal substances, the ACLU said.  &gt;The lawsuit alleges the defendants violated Prieto's right to be free of unlawful search and seizure by taking his money without probable cause and by fingerprinting and photographing him.  &gt;""Mere possession of approximately $23,700 does not establish probable cause for a search or seizure,"" the lawsuit said.  &gt;It said Prieto pulled into the weigh station about 10:30 a.m. Aug. 8 and was let go about 4 p.m.  &gt;DEA agents told Prieto he would receive a notice of federal proceedings to permanently forfeit the money within 30 days and that to get it back, he'd have to prove it was his and did not come from illegal drug sales.  &gt;They told him the process probably would take a year, the ACLU said.  &gt;The ACLU's New Mexico executive director, Peter Simonson, said Prieto needs his money now to pay bills and maintain his truck. The lawsuit said Prieto does not like banks and customarily carries his savings as cash.  &gt;""The government took Mr. Prieto's money as surely as if he had been robbed on a street corner at night,"" Simonson said. ""In fact, being robbed might have been better. At least then the police would have treated him as the victim of a crime instead of as a perpetrator.""  &gt;The DEA did not immediately respond Friday to a request for comment from The Associated Press.  &gt;Peter Olson, a spokesman for the Department of Public Safety, which oversees state police, said he could not comment on pending litigation.  &gt;The lawsuit names DEA Administrator Karen P. Tandy, DEA task force officer Gary T. Apodaca, DEA agent Joseph Montoya and three state police officers identified only as John or Jane Doe.  There has been no further updates to this so the case is still in the courts. Our government will spend millions to make sure he never sees that money again.",¬©
t5_2qpol,paulsagan4pres,1337694592,"In case anybody is confused, I wrote this   myself  Homosexuality is romantic or sexual attraction or behavior between members of the same sex or gender. As a sexual orientation, homosexuality refers to ""an enduring pattern of or disposition to experience sexual, affectionate, or romantic attractions"" primarily or exclusively to people of the same sex; ""it also refers to an individual's sense of personal and social identity based on those attractions, behaviors expressing them, and membership in a community of others who share them.""[1][2] Homosexuality is one of the three main categories of sexual orientation, along with bisexuality and heterosexuality, within the heterosexual-homosexual continuum (with asexuality sometimes considered the fourth). Scientific and medical understanding is that sexual orientation is not a choice, but rather a complex interplay of biological and environmental factors.[1][3] While some religious organizations hold the view that homosexual activity is unnatural or dysfunctional,[4] research shows that homosexuality is an example of normal variation in human sexuality and is not in and of itself a source of negative psychological effects.[1] Prejudice and discrimination against homosexual and bisexual people, however, have been shown to cause psychological harm.[5] The most common terms for homosexual people are lesbian for women and gay for men, though gay is also used to refer generally to homosexual men and women. The number of people who identify as gay or lesbian‚Äîand the proportion of people who have same-sex sexual experiences‚Äîare difficult for researchers to estimate reliably for a variety of reasons.[6] In the modern West, according to major studies, 1% to 3% of the population is homosexual, while 2% to 13% have had some form of same-sex sexual contact within their lifetime.[7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17] In a 2006 study, 20% of respondents anonymously reported some homosexual feelings, although 2-3% identified themselves as homosexual.[18] Homosexual behavior is also widely observed in animals.[19][20][21][22][23] Many gay and lesbian people are in committed same-sex relationships, though only recently have census forms and political conditions facilitated their visibility and enumeration.[24][25][26][27][28][29][30][31][32] These relationships are equivalent to heterosexual relationships in essential psychological respects.[2] Homosexual relationships and acts have been admired, as well as condemned, throughout recorded history, depending on the form they took and the culture in which they occurred.[33] Since the end of the 19th century, there has been a movement towards increased visibility, recognition and legal rights for homosexual people, including the rights to marriage and civil unions, adoption and parenting, employment, military service, and equal access to health care.

In the context of sexuality, lesbian refers only to female homosexuality. The word ""lesbian"" is derived from the name of the Greek island Lesbos, where the poet Sappho wrote largely about her emotional relationships with young women.[35][36] Many modern style guides in the U.S. recommend against using homosexual as a noun, instead using gay man or lesbian.[37] Similarly, some recommend completely avoiding usage of homosexual as it has a negative, clinical history and because the word only refers to one's sexual behavior (as opposed to romantic feelings) and thus it has a negative connotation.[37] Gay and lesbian are the most common alternatives. The first letters are frequently combined to create the initialism LGBT (sometimes written as GLBT), in which B and T refer to bisexual and transgender people. The first known appearance of homosexual in print is found in an 1869 German pamphlet by the Austrian-born novelist Karl-Maria Kertbeny, published anonymously,[38] arguing against a Prussian anti-sodomy law.[39][40] In 1879, Gustav Jager used Kertbeny's terms in his book, Discovery of the Soul (1880).[40] In 1886, Richard von Krafft-Ebing used the terms homosexual and heterosexual in his book Psychopathia Sexualis, probably borrowing them from Jager. Krafft-Ebing's book was so popular among both layman and doctors that the terms ""heterosexual"" and ""homosexual"" became the most widely accepted terms for sexual orientation.[40][41] As such, the current use of the term has its roots in the broader 19th-century tradition of personality taxonomy.  Although early writers also used the adjective homosexual to refer to any single-sex context (such as an all-girls' school), today the term is used exclusively in reference to sexual attraction, activity, and orientation. The term homosocial is now used to describe single-sex contexts that are not specifically sexual. There is also a word referring to same-sex love, homophilia. Some synonyms for same-sex attraction or sexual activity include men who have sex with men or MSM (used in the medical community when specifically discussing sexual activity) and homoerotic (referring to works of art). Pejorative terms in English include queer, faggot, fairy, poof, and homo. Beginning in the 1990s, some of these have been reclaimed as positive words by gay men and lesbians, as in the usage of queer studies, queer theory, and even the popular American television program Queer Eye for the Straight Guy. The word homo occurs in many other languages without the pejorative connotations it has in English. As with ethnic slurs and racial slurs, however, the misuse of these terms can still be highly offensive; the range of acceptable use depends on the context and speaker. Conversely, gay, a word originally embraced by homosexual men and women as a positive, affirmative term (as in gay liberation and gay rights), has come into widespread pejorative use among young people. History  Main articles: LGBT history and Timeline of LGBT history Societal attitudes towards same-sex relationships have varied over time and place, from expecting all males to engage in same-sex relationships, to casual integration, through acceptance, to seeing the practice as a minor sin, repressing it through law enforcement and judicial mechanisms, and to proscribing it under penalty of death. In a detailed compilation of historical and ethnographic materials of Preindustrial Cultures, ""strong disapproval of homosexuality was reported for 41% of 42 cultures; it was accepted or ignored by 21%, and 12% reported no such concept. Of 70 ethnographies, 59% reported homosexuality absent or rare in frequency and 41% reported it present or not uncommon.""[42] In cultures influenced by Abrahamic religions, the law and the church established sodomy as a transgression against divine law or a crime against nature. The condemnation of anal sex between males, however, predates Christian belief. It was frequent in ancient Greece; ""unnatural"" can be traced back to Plato.[43] Many historical figures, including Socrates, Lord Byron, Edward II, and Hadrian,[44] have had terms such as gay or bisexual applied to them; some scholars, such as Michel Foucault, have regarded this as risking the anachronistic introduction of a contemporary construction of sexuality foreign to their times,[45] though others challenge this.[46] A common thread of constructionist argument is that no one in antiquity or the Middle Ages experienced homosexuality as an exclusive, permanent, or defining mode of sexuality. John Boswell has countered this argument by citing ancient Greek writings by Plato,[47] which describe individuals exhibiting exclusive homosexuality.   Khnumhotep and Niankhkhnum.

This turned out to be a Bad Idea‚Ñ¢ and it worsened our relationship, and then I had the good sense to listen to her when she wanted to get a second mortgage to finish the house quickly so we could get out of the state.  Fast forward a year or so, we are out of money and our relationship is on the rocks. We decide to separate, and I, trying to be the good guy, say I will take the house.  So, on half of our previous earnings, I have re-electrified the whole house (it was original 100 year old wiring before), replumbed the whole house with pex plastic tubing and a manifold system, essentially created a kitchen (no pre-existing cabinets before!), added a half bath, tiled the kitchen floor, completely renovated the existing bathroom. I've done all of this with the help of a few friends, my dad, and an amazing girlfriend. The only thing I've had hired out was new drywall in two rooms (because I did the ceiling in the kitchen and it was a HUGE pain in the ass).

If you wire them split down the middle and then find you have to replace said fan tray it requires unplugging 50% of the connections!

You can pop out a line card with all the cables attached for testing / replacement.

I've never heard anyone use that word to describe the flavor of something and I'm trying to understand what you mean.  Sweet, salty, bitter, sour, savory?  Which is it?  Saying something tastes like oxidation would be like saying ""object X smells like wind blowing"".    &gt;I'd say Tabasco scaled well. The have somewhat of a volume.  I wouldn't.  They waste a ton of money doing pepper mash fermentation using oak barrels as opposed to using cheaper materials, but I was pointing out it works for them because they use this method mostly for marketing publicity these days, and not because it's the most efficient method of production.  &gt;More non-sense. The materials used were the ONLY thing that created the anaerobic environment.  Normally I let claims without citations like yours go by the wayside because 99% of the time it's someone trolling.  But you had me curious so I decided to poke into this more.  This article seems to describe what you're talking about - http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1370/is_n1_v26/ai_11819300/  For one, the material being fermented (fish) is much different from pepper mash fermentation, so you're confusing the two.  There are many differences in production of each product, so you can't directly compare the two.  But I'll play along anyway.  Speaking directly to your point about vessel fermentation in general, if you read the article you'd notice the materials used for fermenting fish was NOT the only variable that changed - the core fundamentals of the procedure of fish fermentation was being altered, i.e. temperature and gas regulation.  When they switched materials, they also switched process methods by creating an anaerobic environment when the containers were snapped shut.  They also changed the typical temperatures involved by doing it above ground.     &gt;Plastic buckets and glass jars also complicate the problem. The food may be put in plastic buckets with the lids snapped tightly shut, providing an anaerobic environment, and then left to ferment above ground.  Again, food science seems to escape them and they just know ""clay pots work"", ignoring the reasons _why_ they work and why other methods can work _better_ as long as they're not Doing It Wrong‚Ñ¢.",‚Ñ¢

(Matthew 5:17-18, NIV)  Some Christians claim that his death and resurrection ""fulfill"" this. That is bullshit for one simple reason: last time I checked, Heaven and Earth haven't passed away.  Jesus also made his views on people ""picking and choosing"" quite clear:  &gt;[Jesus] answered them, ‚ÄúAnd why do you break God‚Äôs commandment because of your tradition? For God said:    *Honor your father and your mother;* and, *The one who speaks evil of father or mother must be put to death.*  &gt; But you say, ‚ÄòWhoever tells his father or mother, ‚ÄúWhatever benefit you might have received from me is a gift committed to the temple‚Äù‚Äî  he does not have to honor his father.‚Äô In this way, you have revoked God‚Äôs word because of your tradition.

They worship Me in vain, teaching as doctrines the commands of men.‚Äù  (Matthew 15:3-9, NIV)   Looks like Jesus has quite a bit to say about people who ignore commandments, in fact. But maybe it's just Matthew?  &gt;It is easier for heaven and earth to disappear than for the least stroke of a pen to drop out of the Law.  (Luke 16:17, NIV)  Okay, so Jesus is a bust. Let's see what the Epistles have to say about the Mosaic Code:  &gt; If you really keep the royal law found in Scripture, ‚ÄúLove your neighbor as yourself,‚Äù you are doing right.  But if you show favoritism, you sin and are convicted by the law as lawbreakers. For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it.   (James 2:8-10, NIV)  &gt;All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness,  (2 Timothy 3:16)  &gt;Do we, then, nullify the law by this faith? Not at all! Rather, we uphold the law.  (Romans 3:31)  Well, shit.   This problem disappears quite quickly if you assert that most of the Bible is hogwash, and you only care about the good parts. If you prefer to cling to it as an inspired document, vague mutterings about ""context"" or about Jesus abolishing the old Law won't get you anywhere.   ",‚Ñ¢

The places people have mentioned for food are also pretty good, though the ones in Midtown are a bit of a walk from Downtown, so I'd recommend driving or hailing a cab down there.  They are worth the commute, but check when they're open; some are just for breakfast and/or lunch.  Personally, I'm not a huge fan of Silver Peak downtown; while the food is pretty good, the menu's not that big or all that innovative.  They have good beer (since they're also a brewpub), but I personally think the Silver Peak on Wonder (which is just east of Midtown) is a little better.  Definitely check out the myriad of dive bars that have already been mentioned elsewhere in this thread.  West 2nd Street is another dive bar that should be on the list, but that's because there are often fights there when people have drank too much.  Strega (just south of Downtown on Arlington) is a hipster bar, but a more approachable one.  Avoid St. James' Infirmary if you want divey, though -- that's Hipster Central‚Ñ¢.  5 Star is kind-of a ""dive club,"" so it may or may not be what you're looking for.  I'm surprised no one has mentioned the Knitting Factory for live music yet.  Bands do play there often.  Some nights, it does become a club/rave thing, so double-check the schedule.  Maybe that's just when DJs are in town, who knows.  Also, Brew Brothers in the El Dorado does have live music, but once again DJs do turn it into a club, so check the schedule again.  Finally, there are a lot of (pretty sketchy) clubs on 4th just east of Downtown that have live music.  I don't really go over there very much, but I know they exist.  Finally, if you want to say hi to some of us Reno Redditors, some of us gather for trivia Wednesday nights at 9 PM at the Sierra Tap House on 1st.  The main entrance is along the River Walk.  I unfortunately won't be there this week, since I'm in the Bay Area, but the others would love to meet you.

t5_2t5sa,turnyouracslaterup,1337752548,"Free speech is a two-way street! _drops mic_  _picks mic back up_ Actually, free speech (in the United States) is a protection _from_ the government passing laws to curtail citizen's rights to free speech, with limited exceptions. A redditor is not prevented by any legal authority from posting most words, just as an SRSer is not prevented from calling it out as offensive and circle jerking all over it. One de facto ""government"", in this case, is reddit, inc., which has only drawn a line against content that they can legally be held responsible for or content they consider ""problematic"" or ""toxic"". One could also say that another de facto ""government"" is the system of up votes, or that of moderators.   Moderators are not by definition book-burners or anti-free-speech because of their role. Rather, it's an agreement that one enters into by posting into a subreddit. ""I transfer away some of my protections of having rules imposed on what gets said in this space for the privilege of posting in a subreddit."" If I don't wish to agree to said rules, I'm welcome to try and sway other people or create another subreddit. If I say something in violation of those rules, I'm liable to get banned, as that was the contract of being a potential member of a subreddit. It is a mild form of censorship, but it's not Censorship‚Ñ¢ in the way we talk about it of a government, because it is not a systematic and powerful entity that prevents any form of dissent. I can still exist on Reddit, on the internet, and publish anything I want elsewhere, given it doesn't violate the forms of speech not protected by the First Amendment ensured to me as a citizen of the United States. YMMV outside of the USA.  Analogy time: Think about a literary magazine. If you submit a piece to the New Yorker, and they reject it outright ‚Äî regardless of if they read it or not, or how great it actually was ‚Äî does that make them censors? Are they preventing you from taking that piece and publishing it elsewhere? Do they own every magazine? No, no, no. They are being editors. Moderators are simply editors of a community, a community that has very public rules and a very particular behavior.   For SRS Prime, that means we c-jerk all over some really outrageous, offensive and nauseating behavior that happens elsewhere on reddit ‚Äî mostly because if we didn't we might lose it and chuck the computer out of the window and have a giant aneurysm caused by a systematic, pervasive and powerful culture of privilege and the reaction of those who are unable or unwilling to empathize with that. There's a time (and place, hint hint, SRSD) for trying to help people understand why and have a good-faith discussion about how we can progress against some of this institutionalization.

It's not and the High Court already ruled on that over 30 years ago:   *One of the leading cases concerning the first part of s 116, Attorney-General (Victoria) ex rel Black v Commonwealth (1981) 146 CLR 559 (known as the DOGS case amongst lawyers) concerned the Commonwealth Parliament enacting a series of acts providing for the payment of financial assistance to each state on condition that the moneys were paid to non-government schools nominated by the Commonwealth.  In that case, the majority dismissed the case on the basis that the provision of financial support in this way did not ‚Äòestablish‚Äô a state religion.*  Nice try though.  &gt;Our schooling results relative to the rest of the world are dropping - I believe this is because we're investing in the wrong things. Compare to finland who do not have private schools as we know it at all.  Or we're spending too much time teaching kids about post modernist interpretations of Shakespeare, free form personal learning projects and cultural sensitivity rather than solid fundamentals backed up by corporal punishment. /s  I dunno. I suspect the answer is much more nuanced than rolling out the old bastard cliches‚Ñ¢ or pointing at a single country and demanding we do what they do.

This [post](http://hotelsongs.tumblr.com/post/23459616353/listen) on tumblr explains my feelings better than I can:   &gt;Here‚Äôs the thing. ASOIAF/GoT as Feminist Text‚Ñ¢ is, uh, debatable‚Äîit‚Äôs a mixed bag of just about everything, quality-wise‚Äîbut it‚Äôs definitely, deliberately a deconstructive one. Tropes are set up to be taken apart: honor, chivalry, and all kinds of rebellion. Essentially, the things that are so often easy in fantasy stories are shown to be difficult to the point of untenability here: the more palatable the morality to the readers, the bigger gap between the ideals and the reality. Nobility in heroes, Feminist Fire in heroines‚Äîit all comes at a significant cost. (Ned Stark dies for his nobility. Arya Stark learns how very difficult it is to buck the rules and throw off the constraints of nobility and become a saucy lady knight!! And if you didn‚Äôt get that from her showing, Cersei Lannister will happily catch you all the way up on the pervasive fuckery of the patriarchy.)  &gt;So to have a character‚Äîany character‚Äîswan in and seduce the noble young king (played straightforwardly so) with the purity of her ideals, and to have that played fully straight, rings false and leaves a sour taste in my mouth.  It feels like a model or an appeasement and it‚Äôs badly written. Like, we can‚Äôt watch the mistreatment of the underclasses (e.g. Ros), we have to have Talisa in Robb‚Äôs (thus our) ear reminding us how bad the class dichotomy is? We can‚Äôt watch Sansa choke on the costs of courtly femininity, we need Talisa telling us that she ran away to do something better than that, telling us how easy it was to give everything up and indicting the world she left behind as unstintingly shallow?  &gt;Mm. Nope. Everything here is too pat: the plucky lady nurse, the noble lady who Threw Off The Constraints Of Class-Based Femininity To Go Do Good!, the clumsy functionality of her as his conscience, the way their sex played out like a reward, not just for him for being an A-OK model young king (this plot is doing neither of them any favours) but for her superior brand of femininity as opposed to the nameless Frey girl‚Äôs lackluster model of faceless female obeisance to society. It‚Äôs an easy rebellion in a series that‚Äôs about making those rebellions hard; it‚Äôs not borne of cost, and it‚Äôs spoon-fed to the audience in a way that nothing else there is.  &gt;Coulda done anything. Did this. It‚Äôs a waste of potential and also time, it‚Äôs not well-written in big, obnoxious, dissonant ways, and I need the other shoe to drop, because the wait and the bluff is not just dull, it‚Äôs dull and lazy in narratively caustic ways. This needs to be false fast, because if it‚Äôs true, it doesn‚Äôt say anything good about what the show thinks the audience expects from its female characters‚Äîor should I say, its Strong Female Characters‚Ñ¢.  **TL;DR** Jeyne being a plucky young girl who is not like other girls goes against the society GRRM has built and the themes of ASOIAF. The ease with which she casts aside the classism and sexism of Westeros invalidates the struggles that the other female characters go through. ",‚Ñ¢

If you do get a new laptop (I'd recommend a desktop personally, but if you don't have room for full desktop setup then a laptop should be fine), make sure to go big on the processor speed and number of cores as well as the video card.

Cononical is already putting out press about their work on a full arm powered distro.   The bummer part is that asus is still very much in bed with microsoft for the majority of their product line.

Just about anything that grows in a pond.  Darwin himself noted some examples in Origin of the Species:  &gt;""When ducks suddenly emerge from a pond covered with duck-weed, I have twice seen these little plants adhering to their backs; and it has happened to me, in removing a little duck-weed from one aquarium to another, that I have unintentionally stocked the one with fresh-water shells from the other. But another agency is perhaps more effectual: I suspended the feet of a duck in an aquarium, where many ova of fresh-water shells were hatching; and I found that numbers of the extremely minute and just-hatched shells crawled on the feet, and clung to them so firmly that when taken out of the water they could not be jarred off, though at a somewhat more advanced age they would voluntarily drop off. These just-hatched mollusks, though aquatic in their nature, survived on the duck's feet, in damp air, from twelve to twenty hours; and in this length of time a duck or heron might fly at least six or seven hundred miles, and if blown across the sea to an oceanic island, or to any other distant point, would be sure to alight on a pool or rivulet.""",‚Ñ¢

The filmmakers follow labour rights lawyers Daniel Kovalik and Terry Collingsworth and an activist for the Stop Killer-Coke! campaign, Ray Rogers, as they attempt to hold the giant U.S. multinational beverage company accountable in this legal and human rights battle. Listed below are union leaders at Coca-Cola's Colombian bottling plants who have been murdered. Hundreds of other Coke workers have been tortured, kidnapped and/or illegally detained by violent paramilitaries, often working closely with plant managements.

t5_2qh2p,Dudesan,1337833862,"I didn't renounce Christianity that very day, of course. I was far too entrenched for that. I figured that since Jesus had so far been a fairly positive influence in my life, I might as well try giving him the benefit of the doubt. After all, I had plenty of friends and family who were still perfectly content with a religion whose history, whose underlying dogma they knew next to nothing about.   What's the fundamental difference between a ""Christian"" who rejects most of Christianity implicitly out of misunderstanding, and a ""Christian"" who rejects most of Christianity *explicitly*, out of disgust? If I was going to pick and choose the good parts, I was at least going to be honest with myself about that fact. So, for a time, I was an increasingly syncretic ""spiritual"" ""Christian"". As I modified my worldview to reflect my changing understanding of philosophy and of how the universe operated, I found that the term applied to me less and less appropriatly. When I found I was holding on to it merely as a cultural formality, I discarded it.  There was a lot more to it than just the dogma, of course. I had a Personal Relationship With God‚Ñ¢. I felt what I identified as God's Presence in my mind. I had ""received visions"". In my moments of deepest prayer or meditation, I was sure I could actually hear a voice talking back to me. It was only as I learned more about psychology that I understood that there were other possible explanations for all of those phenomena, and it was years before I admitted that those other explanations just plain *made more sense*.  I tried out all sorts of different metacosmologies, from polytheism to panentheism to deism to pure solipsism. Perhaps, I thought, Yahweh was a Caananite war-god (just one of many extremely powerful beings) who had had a really lucky streak and ended up far more powerful by wiping out his peers. Perhaps Jesus was a philosopher (who may have been a magician, a demigod, or simply a charlatan) who was attempting to civilize Yahweh's followers by degrees, by explaining things to them in terms they could understand, even if that required some insincere toadying to the tyrant.  Or perhaps the One True God was ineffable, and could only be understood for how he interacted with our universe. While every religion was almost certainly wrong, might there not still be an Ultimate Intelligence who can be communicated with and who ought to be venerated?  Or perhaps *I* was God, and just hadn't figured it out yet.  Or perhaps all this speculation was pointless, since it offered absolutely nothing to my understanding of the world. Perhaps I should stop wasting my time trying out different wild unfalsifiable speculations, and focus all that extra energy on understanding our beautiful, complex, *natural* world. ",‚Ñ¢

t5_2sgq6,Tobris,1337842666,"The problem with listening to ""people on the internet"" is that they don't actually know what they want. And they sure as hell don't actually want it hard.  Players today don't know what they want - they just know they're bored with WoW and its clones. Which is why there are so many ""WoW-killers"" that don't really go anywhere. They might get off the ground and into the green, but they don't skyrocket.   Ultimately I believe what players want is a feeling of accomplishment after an hour of play, WoW was very, very good at this. You logged on, you ran a couple of quests or a dungeon and you got a level or a piece of gear for it - it's only when they tried to exploit that mechanic via the daily system that people slowly began to realize they were being taken for a ride on the Psychological Exploitation Pony‚Ñ¢, being given the feeling of reward, without an actual reward (Tokens.)  The problem with the kind of game you're looking for is that it would require its playerbase to have patience, something gamers aren't known for in the slightest. In order to get that feeling of reward they would need to invest days, weeks and months to see anything, rather than an hour or two. EVE works very much like this, you can log on for a few hours in a day and make a few million ISK (EVE's Currency,) and you don't really feel very accomplished, but a month down the road when you've trained enough skills and saved up enough ISK to buy that Battleship you want is where the reward is.  A game that takes that long to deliver a rewarding feeling won't be super popular. EVE has a pretty healthy playerbase, but it's not big, and it's viewed as a non-competitor by the bigger (and more hyped-but-ultimately-failure) titles.  TL;DR: You really have to look at it from a psychological perspective, rather than a mechanical, idea or development one. People play games to get away from real life, where reward takes a lot of hard work and effort, and they don't want their games to function the same way.",‚Ñ¢

t5_2qhqb,strolls,1337848898,"&gt; surely it is easier to teach programming on a normal computer? Which schools already have many of? Sure - programming is more difficult in a Windows environment sometimes but hell there is nothing from stopping them using Linux as there are quite a few easy distributions now.  The problem is that schools have a requirement to teach Word and Powerpoint and all their classrooms are set up that way. I don't know if that's a literal requirement for the syllabus, I suspect so (i.e. students must be able to write a report not in a ""word processor"" but in Microsoft Word‚Ñ¢) but even if it isn't, schools have standardised on Microsoft because it's easier, safe and familiar.  A local software development company talked on my town's IT mailing list about using Microsoft SQL server as their backend, and I asked why they chose that. The guy's response basically opened with ""naff off, and don't talk to me about MySQL"". Now I could have gone back and asked him, ""well, have you compared performance with PostgreSQL or any of the other alternatives"" but he maintained that not only do Microsoft make a good SQL server product (I have no idea whether this is true) but that his customers *expect* Microsoft. They would rather pay ¬£800 or ¬£1200 for a Microsoft license than learn about or understand the alternatives. And I don't mean the support element of that - that can be addressed by the supplier, I mean their managers will ask the question ""it's not Microsoft, what is it?"", fail to understand the answer and switch off. They'd rather throw money at the problem, because they recognise the Microsoft brand and they don't want to be confused.  So this is a massive barrier to Linux in the classroom - Windows is everywhere and installing anything else on the regular PCs is a ""risk"" and a ""problem"".  A motivated and knowledgable IT teacher could burn 20 or 30 Linux liveCDs and boot every computer with them (assuming booting from CDs isn't prevented by the school's IT policies), but this consumes time at the beginning of the lesson and it means that the system is volatile. The students have to save their work on a USB key and there's this risk that they save a file on the desktop (or wherever) and lose it if they forget to save it safely when they finish the session. I'm not sure if you can save a program with the executable bit set on a FAT filesystem, so that the student can save and run their file from the USB key - otherwise there's a risk that the key will be unreadable on a home PC and be formatted because it's believed ""corrupt"".  Now all these things are surmountable, but the Pi is attractive because it's small, cheap and self-contained. You just unplug the monitor and keyboard of the ""normal computer"", plug in the Pi and it's a complete environment. The student can take it home with them and plug it into their telly, and do homework there.  As you say, the problem is technologically illiterate teachers and managers. They were slow catching on two decades ago, and our politicians allowed themselves to be guided by ""the needs of business"" because teaching Powerpoint and Excel was something that they all understood (the teachers and the politicians). It is *hard* to find good teachers who can program, and it's just really not in the budget.",‚Ñ¢

t5_2qore,morewood,1337868978,"&gt;We‚Äôd like to address some of the ongoing concerns from the Diablo¬Æ III community since the game went live last week, and go into more detail about how we plan to tackle some of the lingering post-launch issues so players can focus on what they want to be focused on -- playing Diablo III. &gt; &gt;**Hotfixes, Upcoming Patch, and Ongoing Issues** &gt; &gt;Since the game‚Äôs launch, we‚Äôve applied a number of hotfixes to address gameplay issues, made tweaks to improve our service stability, and performed occasional server maintenance when necessary to ensure that in the long term, players have the best gameplay experience possible. Moving forward, additional server maintenances will be required -- and sometime next week, we plan to release a game update in the form of a patch that will further address client issues and apply additional bug fixes. &gt; &gt;We also wanted to let you know that we‚Äôre still looking into the best way to address the achievements that some players lost in the hours following the game‚Äôs release. While we don‚Äôt have any concrete details to share with you just yet, we will have more information to share in the weeks ahead. We appreciate everyone‚Äôs patience as we work to improve stability and usability for all players. &gt; &gt;**Real-Money Auction House Coming Soon** &gt; &gt;In light of the post-launch obstacles we‚Äôve encountered, we have made the decision to move the launch of the real-money auction house beyond the previously estimated May time frame. As we mentioned in our original announcement, our goal has always been to ensure everyone has the smoothest experience possible when the real-money auction house launches, and we need a bit more time to iron out the existing general stability and gameplay issues before that feature goes live. While we don‚Äôt have a new launch date to share just yet, we‚Äôll have more information soon. &gt; &gt;**Battle.net¬Æ/Diablo III Security Concerns** &gt; &gt;Over the past couple of days, players have expressed concerns over the possibility of Battle.net¬Æ account compromises. First and foremost, we want to make it clear that the Battle.net and Diablo III servers have not been compromised. In addition, the number of Diablo III players who‚Äôve contacted customer service to report a potential compromise of their personal account has been extremely small. In all of the individual Diablo III-related compromise cases we‚Äôve investigated, none have occurred after a physical Battle.net Authenticator or Battle.net Mobile Authenticator app was attached to the player‚Äôs account, and we have yet to find any situation where a Diablo III player's account was accessed outside of ‚Äútraditional‚Äù compromise methods (i.e. someone logging using an account's login email and password). &gt; &gt;To that end, we‚Äôve also seen discussions regarding the possibility of account compromises occurring in ways that didn‚Äôt involve these ‚Äútraditional‚Äù methods -- for example, by ‚Äúsession spoofing‚Äù a player‚Äôs identity after he or she joins a public game. Regarding this specific example, we‚Äôve looked into the issue and found no evidence to indicate compromises are occurring in this fashion, and we‚Äôve determined the methods being suggested to do so are technically impossible. However, you have our assurance that we‚Äôll continue to investigate reports such as these and keep you informed of important updates. &gt; &gt;The best defense against account theft still includes smart password management (e.g. using a unique password for every site/service and keeping your password to yourself) and scanning for malware and viruses regularly, as well as following additional preventative steps found here. In the end, while no security method is 100% foolproof, the physical Battle.net Authenticator and Battle.net Mobile Authenticator app are great ways to provide your account with an extra layer of protection. &gt; &gt;We hope this update has addressed some of the concerns you‚Äôve had. In the end, we simply want all of our players to be able to fully enjoy Diablo III, and we‚Äôve been working around the clock to address issues as quickly and efficiently as possible. We appreciate your continued support and enthusiasm, and we hope you and your friends are having a blast slaying Sanctuary‚Äôs demons. &gt;  EDIT: Format",¬Æ

t5_2qh03,jgclark,1337872671,"Well, the *Sonic 4*s aren't developed by Sonic Team; they're developed by Dimps, and in my opinion it shows.    I do like *Sonic 4: Episode II* a lot more than its predecessor, but it still doesn't feel right.  *Generations* Classic Sonic wasn't exactly like the Genesis games, but it was close enough to be manageable.    From what I've played so far, it seems that you can use Tails to correct any mis-aimed jumps, which feels pretty cheap.  Also the regular spin dash feels really neutered, but the Power of Friendship‚Ñ¢ spin dash has ridiculous speed.    I saw one reviewer praise *Sonic 4: E 2*'s inclusion of enemies that take multiple hits.  This guy must have skipped over *Sonic Heroes* and *Sonic 2006*, because enemies in those games took so many hits it was just frustrating.  I hope Sonic Team and Dimps don't get any ideas about reimplementing mini-Gundams that have ~24 HP.  So far, I've only encountered polar bears with 3 HP, and I feel that's reasonable, but definitely pushing it.    While I dislike the homing attack chains in 2D, it is nice that if you have speed, sometimes you can just bounce along the chain without using homing attacks.  (Specifically, I'm thinking of one in the rollercoaster level.)    All in all, the level design in *Episode II* is far above and beyond *Episode I*, and personally, I feel level design is the primary strength of Sonic games, and really any platformer.    And in the Steam library, like *Episode I*, *Episode II* appears as ""SONIC THE HEDGEHOG 4: Episode II"", which is just obnoxious.    So yeah, I'd definitely recommend it to any 2D platformer fan, especially to someone who is a Sonic fan, but I would place the caveat that there are better 2D platformers out there, including (most of) *Sonic Generations* and (probably) *Rayman Origins*.

t5_2qu49,AverageCommunityFan,1337895589,"That's mainly what I'm childishly trying to point out here. The vocal portion of fans seem to regard Harmon as having been some kind of God, exercising omniscient control over all aspects of production. When in reality, while Harmon was ""the ringleader"" (so the speak) and certainly helped mold Community into what it is, television is an inherently collaborative medium, perhaps more so than any other.  And yes, McKenna, the Russos, Goldman, and Donovan are leaving as well. This, in my mind, is absolutely worrying. Definitely more worrying than Harmon alone leaving.  But what is the community's reaction? What does it say on the top of this page? ""#danharmoniscommunity"". It's ridiculous.  Half of the responses on this page involve somehow using Ganz's position in a way to sneak Harmon back onto the show. As if Ganz herself was only a conduit through which Harmon channeled his genius. A completely insulting notion to have toward the woman who's written some of the best episodes this show has ever seen (For those of you who have forgotten: Cooperative Calligraphy, Intermediate Documentary Filmmaking, Documentary Filmmaking: Redux and Basic Lupine Urology -- which although I did not care for all too much as I felt it stepped too far out of the existing show universe was a pitch perfect Law and Order parody)  I have loved this show.

First and foremost, we want to make it clear that the Battle.net and Diablo III servers have not been compromised. In addition, the number of Diablo III players who've contacted customer service to report a potential compromise of their personal account has been extremely small. In all of the individual Diablo III-related compromise cases we've investigated, none have occurred after a physical Battle.net Authenticator or Battle.net Mobile Authenticator app was attached to the player's account, and we have yet to find any situation where a Diablo III player's account was accessed outside of ""traditional"" compromise methods (i.e. someone logging using an account's login email and password).  To that end, we've also seen discussions regarding the possibility of account compromises occurring in ways that didn‚Äôt involve these ""traditional"" methods -- for example, by ""session spoofing"" a player‚Äôs identity after he or she joins a public game. Regarding this specific example, we've looked into the issue and found no evidence to indicate compromises are occurring in this fashion, and we've determined the methods being suggested to do so are technically impossible. However, you have our assurance that we‚Äôll continue to investigate reports such as these and keep you informed of important updates.  The best defense against account theft still includes smart password management (e.g. using a unique password for every site/service and keeping your password to yourself) and scanning for malware and viruses regularly, as well as following additional preventative steps found here. In the end, while no security method is 100% foolproof, the physical Battle.net Authenticator and Battle.net Mobile Authenticator app are great ways to provide your account with an extra layer of protection.""",¬Æ

Epidemiology data from road traffic arrests and fatalities indicate that after alcohol, marijuana is the most frequently detected psychoactive substance among driving populations. Marijuana has been shown to impair performance on driving simulator tasks and on open and closed driving courses for up to approximately 3 hours. Decreased car handling performance, increased reaction times, impaired time and distance estimation, inability to maintain headway, lateral travel, subjective sleepiness, motor incoordination, and impaired sustained vigilance have all been reported. Some drivers may actually be able to improve performance for brief periods by overcompensating for self-perceived impairment. The greater the demands placed on the driver, however, the more critical the likely impairment. Marijuana may particularly impair monotonous and prolonged driving. Decision times to evaluate situations and determine appropriate responses increase. Mixing alcohol and marijuana may dramatically produce effects greater than either drug on its own.",¬Æ

I changed ""annoyed"" to ""annoying"" which I guess was your intended word)  Correct‚ù£  &gt; This setup relies on two things: the GPL is flawless, you are flawless.  Yes, this is the basis for my way of thinking and actioning, however, despite I have a [big ego and some narcissistic symptoms](http://wish-it.se/hip/singularity2) I do not suffer from hybris[1], and I know that GPL is not flawless and I am not flawless.  Regarding GPL, I'm aware that the forcing nature of GPL can be annoying for some[2]. However, as I have expressed in other places, for now, I see GPL as THE way to lead us out from a world controlled by proprietary (read monetary/profit[3]) thinking actors. In the way I see it (as I discussed on my blog entry from Dec [""Love as a universal concept""](http://rolandorre.se/?p=15) ) I view GPL  as ""mutual love"" or ""love by contract"" that is, like a marriage. BSD on the other hand, I refer to as ""agape"" or unconditional love. Ideally, I would see a world without any proprietary software, and then the issue about GPL versus BSD would be completely irrelevant.  Regarding myself, I have flaws, I'm a human being, I may wish that I had less flaws, but when I discuss or get annoyed I do not look upon myself as that flawless right-knowing guy,  I get annoyed of things that are wrong, but I do not claim that my view is absolute or even right. I do claim though that my brain is ""auto-logic"" which is somewhat controversial (especially as I've defined Love as logic).  ---------------  1.

By following the below guidelines, you can help Adobe protect the Photoshop brand name.  The Photoshop trademark must never be used as a common verb or as a noun. The Photoshop trademark should always be capitalized and should never be used in possessive form or as a slang term. It should be used as an adjective to describe the product and should never be used in abbreviated form. The following examples illustrate these rules:  Trademarks are not verbs.  * Correct: The image was enhanced using Adobe¬Æ Photoshop¬Æ software. * Incorrect: The image was photoshopped.

It's doubtful that Johnson could win, but I think a lot of people are really disappointed and feel betrayed by the Republicrats of late.

I don't really clop to ponies, but...  * I saw some of the ""rule 34"" art on e.g. 4chan long before I started watching the show, but didn't think much of it.  After I got into the show, I found this place and thought it was hilarious and wonderful. * I never felt like I had to or anything, it just makes me smile to see all the novel ideas people have about the show and how they manifest in the creative work‚Äîa very large portion of which is top-notch quality! * Well, if someone (i.e. an adult) feels strongly connected to a particular character or even the show in general, they will probably tend to think about that character or world in the many various contexts of their own life.  However, more adult themes like sexuality and other mature things are entirely omitted from the show, so it seems reasonable for people to want to fill the gaps in their psyche left by the show's limitations. * I'm not attracted to any of the characters (they're fictional!) although some of their personalities remind me of things that attract or even repel me in humans, and it's fun to identify with the characters as their interactions reveal those traits. * (This one doesn't really apply here...) * I think it's probably because lots of people here find the human form sexy, which makes sense, given that we're humans :)  Oh, it's fine if you think this place is weird.

This one has had newer pickups installed, but all other hardware is original.  ***What is the link to the manufacturer's product page or a page with more information?***  After deciding against the many reissues out there (particularly japanese) I decided to hunt out an original, mainly because although I love japanese fender, there were quite a few mustang reissues that just disappointed me in quality control standards. Watch out for badly finished frets and nasty neck lacquer. You can find a lot of mustang reissues here on [fender's main site](http://www.fender.com/en-GB/products/search.php?section=guitars&amp;bodyShape=Mustang¬Æ)  ***What is the construction like (type of wood, wiring, case, tubes, etc..)?***  Wood type is alder, fitting with most fender's in the CBS era. Information on that can be found [here](http://home.provide.net/~cfh/fender2.html#mustang)  ***What made you want to buy it?***  I'm a short guy, so the first reason I swayed towards Mustang's was the shorter scale length. I love Jaguars, and everything [offset](reddit.com/r/offset) but found most too big and clunky for my on-stage antics. I'm a big fan of Billy Corgan and found the pickups here to be just a little less hot than his, letting me really get that alternative fuzz squeal!   ***What do you love about it now that you have it?***  The neck is amazing. I mean, just superb. Its part;y down to the amount it's been played, but also partly down to the lacquer they used before 1968. I've played later models and the lacquer is just a bit thicker and a bit stickier, this one seems just the right texture, and whats more, the profile is perfect for me. The weight is amazing, and the balance is great. The access to the top frets is just right, a little better than my strat, and a little bit more fun to play due to the scale length.  ***If anything, What might be upgraded/fixed/altered?***  I might replace the on-off switches on each pickup as they are a little bit loose, and don't click as firmly into position as they should for on stage playability. They were in much worse shape when I got them, but after servisol and a bit of cleaning, they are much better now.  I really might consider having a professional re-finish done on it, in nitro-cellulose. It was originally daphne blue, but I might have it refinished in olympic white. Its much further down the line though and I might change my mind before then.  ***How versatile is it (ability to be used in various genres/styles)?***  Very. Surprisingly the pickup switching gives you loads of combinations of in phase, out of phase and both on and off. I've yet to crank it up at a band rehearsal but at home, I'm finding it as versatile as a stratocaster, even though its without a middle pickup.  ***What else can you tell us about it?***  The case (pictured) isn't original, and was hand-made by someone many years ago. The interior of it was just raw sponge, and so my girlfriend and I decided to re-line it with leopard print, and cut out foam especially for the shape of the guitar, keeping the new baby safe :)  edit: punctuation",¬Æ

At Professional REL, spectators must not interfere with the match directly.  &gt;Players may request that a spectator not observe their matches.

t5_2qjl3,aelephant,1338194296,"Thanks. Sorry if I'm coming off as combative or argumentative. I think that was the point I was trying to work my way toward.  Zegerid¬Æ contains 1100mg of Sodium bicarbonate per pill. The molecular weight of Sodium bicarbonate is about 84 and Sodium is about 23, so roughly 27% of Sodium bicarbonate is Sodium. That means a 1100mg pill has about 300mg of Sodium in it. However, since Zegerid¬Æ is only once a day, I think it is negligible.  You're right about Alka-Seltzer¬Æ, it has a bit more Sodium &amp; it can be used more frequently (up to 8 a day for young folks &amp; 4 a day for 60 or older), so I think you have a good point here.

Are you that out of touch? He did it calmly, didn't announce it, didn't do anything crazy. It's not ""showy"". It's not a tantrum.

'Had that not happened, you'd likely not even know about it because he likely didn't want to make a big deal about it.

( As he, himself, did not bring forward information of his actions---Which is the ""tell"" for what a tantrum is. Even from a psychological standpoint of narcissism, he would WANT people to know and would state it somehow. He did not. He was missing for all of five minutes, returned, forfeited a match, and retired to his room not stating to a single person that he had deleted his social media groupings. )  He didn't throw a tantrum.  I'm sorry, but you've lost this ""gentleman's"" argument.

Your clothes don't look like what a girl would usually wear, and the distribution of fat on your body look masculine (at least with loose clothes)  But if your body language were characteristic of a girl I could maybe think you're a girl.

t5_2qh2p,Dudesan,1338299407,"Remember, many Christians find it more comfortable to believe in a god who doesn't condone, command or commit murder, slavery, rape, child abuse, animal abuse, arson, torture, ritual mutilation, fratricide, patricide, matricide, infanticide, genocide, and so on than to believe in one who does. Unfortunately, since the Bible (Old Testamant and New) is pretty clear about Yahweh's position on these things, holding a belief in Loving Hippie Jesus‚Ñ¢ requires ignoring huge portions of it. Or just never reading it in the first place, which seems to be the most popular option.  Well, let's say what Jesus has to say about that:  &gt;‚ÄúDo not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished.  (Matthew 5:17-18, NIV)  Some Christians claim that his death and resurrection ""fulfill"" this. That is bullshit for one simple reason: last time I checked, Heaven and Earth haven't passed away.  Jesus also made his views on people ""picking and choosing"" quite clear:  &gt;[Jesus] answered them, ‚ÄúAnd why do you break God‚Äôs commandment because of your tradition? For God said:    *Honor your father and your mother;* and, *The one who speaks evil of father or mother must be put to death.*  &gt; But you say, ‚ÄòWhoever tells his father or mother, ‚ÄúWhatever benefit you might have received from me is a gift committed to the temple‚Äù‚Äî  he does not have to honor his father.‚Äô In this way, you have revoked God‚Äôs word because of your tradition. Hypocrites! Isaiah prophesied correctly about you when he said:    &gt;These people honor Me with their lips, but their heart is far from Me.  They worship Me in vain, teaching as doctrines the commands of men.‚Äù  (Matthew 15:3-9, NIV)   Looks like Jesus has quite a bit to say about people who ignore commandments, in fact. But maybe it's just Matthew?  &gt;It is easier for heaven and earth to disappear than for the least stroke of a pen to drop out of the Law.  (Luke 16:17, NIV)  Okay, so Jesus is a bust. Let's see what the Epistles have to say about the Mosaic Code:  &gt; If you really keep the royal law found in Scripture, ‚ÄúLove your neighbor as yourself,‚Äù you are doing right.  But if you show favoritism, you sin and are convicted by the law as lawbreakers. For **whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it**.   (James 2:8-10, NIV)  &gt;**All Scripture is God-breathed** and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness,  (2 Timothy 3:16)  &gt;Do we, then, nullify the law by this faith? Not at all! Rather, we uphold the law.  (Romans 3:31)  &gt;Know this first of all, that **there is no prophecy of scripture that is a matter of personal interpretation**, for no prophecy ever came through human will; but rather human beings moved by the holy Spirit spoke under the influence of God.""  (2 Peter 20-21 NAB)  Well, shit.   This problem disappears quite quickly if you assert that most of the Bible is hogwash, and you only care about the good parts. If you prefer to cling to it as an inspired document, vague mutterings about ""context"" or about Jesus abolishing the old Law won't get you anywhere. ",‚Ñ¢

t5_2qh5b,Zombiescout,1338318974,"&gt;But I also assume, that since this is a possible state of existence for the mind, than it is by extension possible for a mind to function adequately in this state, given an acceptable period of acclimatization.  I see little basis for the claim that the mind can acclimate to anything, psychic breaks etc. brought on by extreme stress would at least *prima facie* speak against that. It also seems to be that if you take eventually towards infinite time that it is not testable or useful.   &gt;I am attempting to distinguish between the label conferred on the word, the abstract symbol that represents the idea, and the 'meaning' or 'explanation' which is inextricably derived from an action.  The meaning is not derived from an action though, it has to be acquired through one but on a broadly Fregean account the meaning is passive and more or less the extension of the term.   &gt; Perhaps you don't agree with me, but I am struck that the 1-ness has vastly more importance than the mere symbol itself, the numeral 1.  Sure but that is, to me at least, the extension of ""1"". Extensions just kind of are there and are what we refer to (this is a very rough sketch and there are lots of problems with this theory)   &gt;But even so, are you really willing to assume that there needn't be consciousness for observation to occur?   Yes. Machines can observe in this sense, which means other objects can too. That is why I thought you were on about quantum consciousness and Capra. The observer just measures or makes note of, or feels, or what have you, the resolution of entanglement or decision depending on your preferred theory. Not only that if you follow Everett then observation does not cause wave function collapse and so there it loses much of its specialness.   &gt;As to the affect of intention on observations, this requires further definition. Are you saying your observations are not affected by the intentions you have? Or are you saying all observations are not affected by anyone's intentions? Or somewhere in between?  Quantum observations are not affected by intentions. My observations (non-quantum) are affected by my intentions.   &gt;I don't think you can say this. The Oxford English Dictionary defines intentionality as ""the distinguishing property of mental phenomena of being necessarily directed upon an object, whether real or imaginary."" Unless you can describe to me a situation where the observer arrives at his observation without using intentionality. Perhaps I'm unaware, and this mode of unintentional observation is integral to the study of quantum mechanics. I think this harkens back to your qualm with 'quantum consciousness'.  Blindsight would be the first thing I think of. Obviously the person still has intentions but he is observing something without being able to say anything about it and having no conscious content of it. But again the main issue is equivocation of observation in QM with observation in everyday parlance.    &gt;Ah, but here you haven't actually explained anything. You begin your observation with ""...there is some..."" This is both the explanation and the cause. It is very small and doesn't explain a great deal, if anything. But saying ""There is some milk that (has such and such properties)"" and saying ""There is some milk because I spilled it,"" doesn't preclude an example of causation. You simply extend your explanation of cause in the second sentence, and expand on details of the state of the milk in the first.  They are two distinct explanations though. One reductive non-causal, one reductive causal. Both explain the same thing but one is less useful when answering the question of why the milk is there.   &gt;The observed phenomena are identical, not in that the particular conditions of their observation are identical, which I tried to make clear, but that their source, from which they emerge and which is radically irreductible (as a premise), is unchanging.  They wouldn't be identical then, just from the same source. Even if they had the same character they would still not be identical. Formally x=y ‚Üí ‚àÄF(Fx ‚Üî Fy) is usually taken to be the basis for identity. If you give up identity for congruence then it works but I am not sure if it really says anything then.   &gt;If this is the what you mean by the problem of overdetermination, I think the problem in my exposition is that I didn't distinguish between the subjective nature of an explanation (i.e. its characteristics, form) and the applicable use of said explanation (i.e. the function).   There is no such distinction though. Either an explanation explains its explanadum or it does not. How you then use them is irrelevant.  I don't get the point about facsimlies, why would sameness of form make copies erroneous?   Explanation here is not the act of explaining something as we often use it in everyday life. It is [explanandum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explanandum) plus explanans. That is to say that we are dealing with propositions only.  ",‚Üî

It also seems to be that if you take eventually towards infinite time that it is not testable or useful.  Ok, but here I'm not arguing for an infinite timeline. I'm supposing that with appropriate diligence a mind could achieve our desired 'threshold' within a tractable length of time, even a human life time.  &gt; The meaning is not derived from an action though, it has to be acquired through one but on a broadly Fregean account the meaning is passive and more or less the extension of the term.  &gt; Sure but that is, to me at least, the extension of ""1"". Extensions just kind of are there and are what we refer to (this is a very rough sketch and there are lots of problems with this theory)  I don't want to get into a chicken and the egg thing here. To take the above stance, would you assert that all meaning is intrinsic arising from its relative word form, and we must extract the latent meaning from said form?  &gt; Yes. Machines can observe in this sense (unconsciously), which means other objects can too. The observer just measures or makes note of, or feels, or what have you, the resolution of entanglement or decision depending on your preferred theory.  This is an interesting point. However, while a machine can conduct an experiment and record the results, can it then take that data and use it to design another experiment to make further conclusions? If it cannot, then I would argue that it has not observed, or at least understood, anything. The machine has no more bared witness than a tree bares witness to the passing seasons. (You can take this discussion into plant sentience if you wish).  &gt; Not only that if you follow Everett then observation does not cause wave function collapse and so there it loses much of its specialness. Quantum observations are not affected by intentions. My observations (non-quantum) are affected by my intentions.  Everett fell off after his initial break through with the many worlds interpretation. He had scant faith in its validity to begin with, and would not have published it if it weren't for the inadvertent support by his mentor, Archibald Wheeler. But where I have to disagree with you is when you state ""My observations (non-quantum)"". There is no such thing. You must concede that quantum affects are observable by methods that are simple, repeatable, and easily recreated. In this way, they are no more inextricable from your observations than the force of gravity. To say that your observations are non-quantum is akin to saying, ""My observations have such and such quality within the laws of Newtonian classical physics."" Yes, that may be true in the abstract. But I am not talking about abstract reality. A premise of my initial argument is that it is set in reality without clause or addendum. As it is, if you were.  &gt; They wouldn't be identical then, just from the same source. Even if they had the same character they would still not be identical. Formally x=y ‚Üí ‚àÄF(Fx ‚Üî Fy) is usually taken to be the basis for identity. If you give up identity for congruence then it works but I am not sure if it really says anything then.  You are not seeing the distinction between subject and action. Identity is a label, a characteristic, a subject. These phenomena don't require an identical character. I'd refer you to another sentence in that paragraph. ""The phenomenal experience is not identical, but there is a characteristic inherent to the phenomena that is experienced by both or many parties, which leads to a similar conclusion."" So here you've moved back from the experiences of the phenomena being identical, which I conceded they are not, to the phenomena themselves being identical, which, I'm not sure if you can distinguish the experience of phenomena from phenomena itself.  In either case, the subject, or form of the phenomena isn't as important as its functioning role in the conclusion of an experiment, the deduction from an observation. When I mentioned the fascimilies (I may have used this word in the wrong way), I was speaking of identical copies. If you conduct an experiment, and observe *subjectively identical* phenomena (which you have said is impossible due to overdetermination), your conclusion won't differ from the initial conclusion, unless you made a human error. This could happen many, many times, and it wouldn't affect your understanding one iota. If you conduct an experiment, and observe *functionally identical* phenomena, again, they would lead to a definite and predetermined conclusion, rendering the entire experiment useless. This is only evident upon repeated testing, which is why science is conducted with such rigor and all theories are shrouded in such skepticism. Eventually though, we could rule out these copies for they do not further our understanding.  What we are trying to understand, our intention if you will, by observing phenomena, is this: **How does (blank) occur?** Apparently you call this question an explanandum. This requires an explanans: **Because there is (blank)**. But if you ask me, ""Why does it rain?"" And I answer, ""Because there are clouds."" What have you learned? What depth and breadth does my explanans have? Very little. You know that there is some kind of causal relationship between rain and clouds, perhaps in future you should expect to see rain when you see clouds. But you know nothing of the changing states of matter, of evaporation and condensation, of meteorological patterns or the rain shadow effect. My explanans to you is a superficial explanans. Furthermore, you are much less likely to accept my explanans (unless you have great faith in me), especially if you already hold an explanans that appears superior in its form and its function.  Now, if we are concerned with understanding reality, do you think we should distinguish between explanations that are superficial in form and function, or those that have a dramatic breadth and depth? Here I would equate form to an explanation's ability to be assimilated by others (a craft we are exercising at present) and its function would be the amount of content conferred on the audience (or understanding). Here I think that form and function of explanations, which compose the **active conduit for exchange of understanding**, are not in any way irrelevant. I would consider them tantamount.",‚Üî

t5_2qh2s,Deightine,1338340985,"I did something similar to one of my players in a Call of Cthulhu game. I had a player who would be present for only one night, and I gave the whole party the Groundhog Day treatment, only the amount of time between resets was shrinking by an hour with each cycle. It started at 12.   However, when they were transported to Another Dimension of Tremendous Horror‚Ñ¢, they found a fellow modern-era guy trapped in the same complex of sand-floored sandstone-walled pyramid hallways that encircled a giant subterranean obelisk. One of my players was being kind of an idiot, and his character was cocky, and told the guy they found (the guy in for one night, my planted evil minion) to give him the guy's Desert Eagle. The guy says no. Meanwhile, the whole party is looking up at this giant obsidian obelisk, sticking up out of an ancient Egyptian themed missile silo, beneath a trio of strange moons.  So the cocky guy's response is to laugh, shrug, and say ""Well, it's alright. I'll just collect the ammunition from your corpse, later.""  So the guy subtly turned, pressed his gun to the side of Cocky-guy's neck and shot him. He got a critical (3%) success on the check, and effectively blew the spine right out of cocky guy's neck, from the side. The DE chambers a pretty big round. Cocky-guy wasn't feeling very cocky... and all of the other characters, having been present to hear what sounded like a threat, ruled it pre-emptive self-defense, possibly a symptom of longterm exposure to the obelisk.  So out of game again, I tell cocky guy to make a new character and to give me his dead guy. Twenty minutes later, he's moping across the room working on a new investigator, when the Groundhog Day flips and I tell everyone that they're suddenly standing where they started. ""All of you."" I said pointedly, looking at cocky guy. I slid him his investigator sheet and he growled.  He never forgave me for that.",‚Ñ¢

You seem to need a few years of getting it horribly wrong before you accept that you're just not smart enough to get it right intuitively [1].  Also, keep in mind that what's efficient on the DCPU probably bears *no resemblance* to what's efficient on a modern, real-world CPU.  The DCPU does not have caches, it does not pipeline or execute instructions out of order.  It doesn't have multiple integer units.  Years ago, building lookup tables was The Correct Approach‚Ñ¢ when dealing with slow things like sin.  Now, it's often faster to just compute sin because it turns out that lots of lookup tables is murder on your L1 cache [2]; I expect DCPU will benefit more from the first approach.  Really, I don't think there's anything the DCPU could teach better than, say, learning Python *in regards to programming*.  It would certainly serve as an introduction to *low level coding* better than Python could, but that's a separate topic.  .  [1] This does not apply to John Carmacks, Tim Sweenys, etc.  Most programmers do *not* fall into this group.

t5_2qh1i,no-mad,1338380790,"  Although the Death Star plans need to get to Yavin as soon as possible, Obi-Wan needs to make one more diversion first. If the Empire knows that Leia is a Rebel leader, then they also know about her father and the whole Organa family may need immediate evacuation. Fortunately, before coming to Tattoine, R2 had already arranged transport, which is waiting at Mos Eisley, under the command of the Rebellion's other chief field agent and espionage asset. Chewbacca. 20 years earlier, Chewbacca was second in command of the defence of his planet. He's there in the tactical conferences and there on the front lines and is a personal friend of Yoda's. When he needed reliable people to join the embryonic Alliance, who else would Yoda turn to but his old friend from Kashykk? Given his background, there is no way that Chewie would spend the crucial years of the rebellion as the second-in-command to (sorry Han) a low-level smuggler. Unless it's his cover. In fact, Chewie is a top-line spy and flies what is in many ways the Rebellion's best ship.  The Millenium Falcon may look like a beat-up old freighter but it can outrun any Imperial ship in normal space or hyperspace, hang in a firefight with a Star Destroyer or outmaneouvre a dozen top-of-the-line TIE fighters. It's a remarkable feat of engineering and must have cost a colossal fortune to build. How does Han come to own a ship like that? He only thinks he does, actually it's Chewie's. Half-way through RotS, we see the Falcon landing at the Senate building on Coruscant. If it's the same ship (which of course it is) then it was the personal transport of one of the senatorial delegations - a much more likely source to commission its design. That delegatino must have later joined the Rebellion and given it the use of the Falcon. In fact, if the delegation is the one from Kashykk, then the ship may have belonged to Chewbacca as early as RotS.  Han is Chewie's front man. It's much better, and safer for him, if he doesn't know what's really going on. Chewie used to work with Lando Calrissian in a similar way but Lando wanted to settle down, so Chewie arranged for him to lose the Falcon in a card game to Han Solo, an even better choice as partner. Han and Chewie's working method is pretty much what we see in the cantina scene: Chewie make the contacts and sets up the deals, then turns them over to Han who haggles over the price and gives the final yea or nay. This lets Chewie wander the seamy underside of the galaxy pretty much at will, making contacts, gathering and passing information with no-one was the wiser, especially not Han.  Chewie persuaded Han to do business with Jabba the Hutt so he could make regular runs to Tattoine, where Chewie could pass messages between Kenobi and Organa. When R2's urgent message came through only days before, the only way for Chewie to get back to Tattoine in time was to make the ""mistake"" that forced Han to dump his cargo to avoid capture. As a down side, this led to Solo's getting a death mark out on him from Jabba the Hutt. Chewie was a bit upset about the need for that but figured they weren't going to be dealing with Tattoine for much longer.  En route to Alderaan, R2 and Chewie play stop-motion chess. This is the latest in a series of games they've played over the year in the back rooms of space stations and cantinas across the galaxy, but this is the first time they've done it in front of their respective straight men, so they put on a big show.  Then it all goes wrong again. Alderaan is gone and the Falcon is caught and brought aboard the Death Star. Only Han, Luke and 3PO don't know just how much trouble they're in but Obi-Wan has a plan and seems confident (but Jedi always do). Soon afterwards, R2 finds Leia in the detention cells and shouts that they have to rescue her, to which Chewie can only agree. If Vader learns he has a daughter, then they're all in deep trouble, so Chewie does his bit to persuade Han to go along with Luke's plan.  Then, on the verge of escape, Vader himself turns up only yards from both of his children, one of whom is leaking Force all over the place. Obi-Wan stages a distraction by letting himself die and go into the Force while the others escape. At this point, Chewie suddenly realises that he's been left in charge, not only of the Death Star Plans and the survival of the Rebellion but of the secret son and daughter of Darth Vader. With the Organas and Kenobi all dead, only Chewie, R2 and Yoda know who Luke and Leia are. And only Ob-Wan knew where Yoda has been hiding. Chewie is stressed out by the responsibility and R2 (who keeps making crude jokes about the whole affair) is being no help at all.  Chewie's first problem is what is happening between Luke and Leia. With a psychic link they can feel but don't understand, thrown together in a life-or-death escape, they are looking at each other with a sparky intensity that Chewie gradually recognises as Romantic Tension. He's no expert on human relationships but Chewie is fairly sure that that's Wrong, so he does the only thing he can under the circumstances - he throws Han at her. Han is at first not interested but after a while starts to warm to the idea with an intensity that gives Chewie new worries.  When they reach Yavin, Han decides to take the money and run and Chewie decides to go with him. Looked at in cold light, it's for the good of the Rebellion. Even if Yavin is destroyed, there'll be one agent who knows what's going on who can try and put something back together, but he doesn't feel good about it. When Han decides to turn around and join the attack, Chewie is all for it.  Han and Luke get medals but Chewie doesn't. Actually, Leia offers him one but Chewie turns it down. He got one of those things from Yoda about 20 years ago, but there's no way he can tell her that.  As the film ends, the three founders of the Rebellion are all gone. Bail Organa is dead, Yoda is out of contact and Obi-Wan's ghost can only talk to other Jedi. (So that would be Yoda then.) Thus, the field leadership of the rebellion has just been turned over to the daughter of Darth Vader. Chewie is really hoping that someone with an official rank greater than hers will get here real soon before he has to think really seriously about option C.  ¬© Keith Martin 2005    No cliff notes ... well, my basic cliff note is this: R2D2 and Chewbacca are the REAL heroes of the story.

I suspect a lot of people look at having kids as, ""I just have to get through the baby part."" Well they aren't lions, people. They don't start being fully functional and self supporting and just go off on their own after the ""cub"" stage. You've got at *least* 18 years of hard work ahead of you, and only 18 if you're lucky.   There's a lot of volunteer work out there working with children of all ages. I'd recommend you look into it and dip your toes in each age group. Then you'll be covering the whole spectrum. Maybe that will help you decide?

t5_2qh1i,spkr4thedead51,1338390971,"Between the release of Starwars episode 1 and episode 2, I recall reading a fan theory about how the young obi-wan kenobi was the jedi who actually became vader and how the young anakin assumed obi-wan's identity. Unfortunately, I don't remember the details and I can't find the website anymore, but it presented a possible track for episode 2 and 3 that I thought would have been fantastic (and easily better than what we got)  edit - [Found it!](http://beastwith.in/1999/09/06/bringing-back-the-force/)  &gt;This is where my theory comes in, you see. Vader is not Luke‚Äôs father, nor, in fact, is he Anakin Skywalker. After watching The Phantom Menace a couple more times, this point only becomes clearer for me. I‚Äôll begin by noting some of the evidence. &gt; &gt;Obi-Wan Kenobi, the revered Jedi, is recognized by the Rebellion as an esteemed hero. Thus, he must obviously have once been a great Jedi, and though this is not shown as being untrue in the beginning of Episode One, there is no real evidence suggesting that Kenobi is an especially good Jedi either. In fact, considering the amount of fear and respect the word Jedi¬ù brings, it can easily be assumed that all Jedi were just as efficient as Kenobi. &gt; &gt;Might I add, now, that young Kenobi wasn‚Äôt an especially stable Jedi. That is, he wasn‚Äôt too well versed in keeping his cool, thinking as any Jedi should. In fact, he breaks the Jedi code at the end of Episode One, when he sees his Master die and, in a fervorous rage, engages Darth Maul in combat. Unlike his Master, Obi-Wan‚Äôs anger comes out, bringing him one step closer to the dark side. That‚Äôs right, folks, it‚Äôs Obi-Wan that becomes Darth Vader, not Anakin. &gt; &gt;Let me extend my hypothesis with an example of this switch being foreshadowed. At the end of Episode One, Anakin is dressed in similar attire, and with a similar hairstyle, as Obi Wan. This is the perfect setup for what‚Äôs to come next; Anakin will not only become Kenobi‚Äôs Jedi student, but he will become Kenobi by name as well. &gt; &gt;Was Lucas really so foolish as to change not only the storyline set by other Star Wars authors, but his own storyline as well? Seemingly, that‚Äôs what he did when he introduced Qui-Gon, since we know from Episodes four through six that Obi-Wan‚Äôs mentor was not Qui-Gon, but Yoda himself. This only makes sense if something else is presented, perhaps the switch I mentioned. If Obi-Wan continues to fall to the dark side, which he has already begun to embrace, and does not complete Anakin‚Äôs Jedi training, who will teach Anakin further? If the shit hits the fan, as I‚Äôm sure it will when Palpatine/Sidious begin kicking ass, then the young boy may have a use after all, and who better to teach the lad than Yoda himself. Certainly makes sense, then, to never mention Qui-Gon as Obi-Wan‚Äôs master, because by the time Luke comes of age, Obi-Wan is Vader, and the old man who‚Äôs teaching Luke is none other than Anakin Skywalker himself, who was brought into the Jedi fold by Master Yoda, not Qui-Gon. The only person of relevance that Qui-Gon taught was Vader, making it perfectly acceptable for him to kill the old Obi-Wan, the very boy who he began to teach those many years back. &gt; &gt;If you thought about the contrived storyline of Episode One at all, you‚Äôll realize that Vader would have had some sort of recognition for his former friends, namely R2D2 and C3PO, who he put together himself. After all, if his supposed son, someone who he had never met before, could bring back some semblance of his old life, why not the droids (especially C3PO, who was his only friends on Tatooine). Though Vader sees these droids, he pays little attention to them; why should he, for when he was Obi-Wan, he could care less about who they were. The only person they mattered to was Anakin. This makes further sense when you consider which droids were sent to Kenobi‚Äôs residence on Tatooine in Episode four. R2D2, who knew Obi-Wan as Anakin, made the trip, not the least surprising bit of information when you put the pieces together. Considering C3PO‚Äôs disposition, Kenobi didn‚Äôt mention anything to him for obvious reasons; C3PO would have blown his cover right off the bat. &gt; &gt;Let me backtrack a small bit to Luke‚Äôs place on the farm. When young Skywalker comes across R2D2‚Ä≤s little secret, he mentions to his uncle that he believes the droids were stolen, since R2D2 claims he is the property of Obi-Wan Kenobi. At this point, Uncle Owen becomes very alarmed, perhaps knowing that the legendary Obi-Wan became Vader. The topic quickly changes when the discussion begins to involve Ben Kenobi, who Uncle Owen claims is someone else. While the audience is meant to believe that Uncle Owen‚Äôs disposition towards Ben Kenobi is bad, we know this to be untrue from Episode five, when Ben explains that Uncle Owen is his brother. Since Anakin left his mother behind on Tatooine, it‚Äôs very possible that she had another child after his departure. It makes more sense for his brother to have remained on Tatooine than to have Obi-Wan and a mysterious brother suddenly appear on the desert planet. Uncle Owen further explains to Luke that Obi-Wan and Luke‚Äôs father died around the same time. In fact, both individuals left their identities behind at the same time, as Obi-Wan assumed the role of Darth Vader, and Anakin assumed the role of Ben Kenobi. &gt; &gt;When Ben Kenobi first shows up in Episode four, R2D2 says something to him. Ben looks at the droid, and responds, ‚ÄúCome here my little friend.‚Äù If Ben is Anakin, this scene makes a lot of sense; R2D2 recognized the old man, and the old man recognized his old acquaintance. When one considers the events in Episode one, the ownership of R2D2 would very likely have gone to Anakin, adding to R2D2‚Ä≤s claim that he is the property of the old hermit on Tatooine in Episode four. Kenobi‚Äôs claim that he doesn‚Äôt recall owning a droid could simply be to keep the ploy running. It certainly eliminates questions that Luke might otherwise ask if Ben claimed he did once own the droid. &gt; &gt;A moment later, Ben approaches Luke, places his hand on his forehead and says to be boy, ‚ÄúRest easy, son.‚Äù Not ‚Äúrest easy, boy,‚Äù or ‚Äúrest easy, young one,‚Äù but he says ‚Äúson‚Äù at a time where Luke is not completely conscious. &gt; &gt;Kenobi‚Äôs place of residence was perfect; he wasn‚Äôt watching over his wartime friend‚Äôs son, but rather his own son. Naturally, he didn‚Äôt tell Luke that he was his father, because that kind of information would have thrown Luke into disarray, having lived so close to his father, yet never having met him before. And there was some truth to his claim that Vader killed Luke‚Äôs father; Anakin Skywalker was indeed dead, replaced by the persona of an old man named Ben Kenobi. For one, it was necessary to hide from Vader and the Empire, as Anakin was well known prior to the rise of the Emperor. Using his real name would have been suicide. And, since Vader was Kenobi, why would the Lord of the Sith go out and look for a guy named Obi-Wan¬ù? That‚Äôs the perfect guise. &gt; &gt;Thinking things over, it makes sense for Ben to say that he hadn‚Äôt heard the name ‚ÄúObi-Wan‚Äù used in a long time; he last heard it used to refer to his once-master, who later became Vader. Additionally, Ben says that Obi-Wan is not yet dead, and his statement need not be taken to suggest that he is in fact Obi-Wan. Vader, of course, also still lives. &gt; &gt;If you‚Äôll recall, Obi-Wan gives Luke a lightsaber once he meets him, and tells him that his father wanted him to have it. How unlikely, considering the amount of time Vader has been the Emperor‚Äôs servant, and how he didn‚Äôt know about his children. After all, if he was Obi-Wan‚Äôs enemy, then why would he give a lightsaber to him and say, ‚ÄúGive this to my son,‚Äù especially when he never even knew his wife was pregnant. It makes perfect sense, however, for Kenobi to give Luke the lightsaber with that claim, if Ben was his father. Kenobi is passing his weapon onto his son. In Episode six, the Emperor notes the construction of a new lightsaber that Luke has put together, saying that it is much like his father‚Äôs. Since Luke had never seen Vader‚Äôs lightsaber up close, he must have constructed his weapon off the design of his old one. &gt; &gt;Moving forward towards the end of Episode four, Ben Kenobi and Vader face off. Contrary to popular recollection, Vader does not say, ‚ÄúWhen I left you, I was the student; now I am the Master.‚Äù but rather says, ‚ÄúWhen I left you, I was the learner; now I am the master.‚Äù The wording here is appropriate, for he‚Äôs not talking about a Jedi student/Master relationship (note the capital ‚ÄòM‚Äô in ‚Äúmaster‚Äù), but rather effectiveness and power with the force. In fact, the Star Wars scripts capitalize ‚Äúmaster‚Äù when referring to Jedi rank, but not otherwise. In this scene, the word ‚Äúmaster‚Äù is not capitalized at all. Here, Vader believes that he is stronger in the force than before, when Anakin was more powerful. &gt; &gt;Now, given all this, someone has to ask the obvious: Why would Vader make the initial claim that he is Luke‚Äôs father? Well, it certainly throws Luke off guard, and seeing that the boy is an enormous threat to him, the intent to mind-fuck the lad is an excellent maneuver. It‚Äôs perfectly reasonable to expect Luke to join your side when you‚Äôre the number two badass in the galaxy, especially when you‚Äôre the most feared mofo out there. Heck, I‚Äôd have probably given in. Note, however, that Vader only once mentions that Luke is his son when not near the boy. When Luke is flying away in the Millennium Falcon at the end of Episode five, Vader feels Luke‚Äôs presence, and says, ‚ÄúLuke,‚Äù not ‚Äúson.‚Äù When Luke responds with, ‚ÄúFather,‚Äù Vader realizes that Luke can hear him, and so he acknowledges his lie, by adding, ‚ÄúSon, come with, me.‚Äù Again, only once does Vader say that Luke is his son when not near the boy, and after rereading the script, it could easily come off as sarcasm, as he‚Äôs talking the Emperor about their plans. &gt; &gt;Additionally, the Emperor never refers to Luke as Vader‚Äôs son, always saying, ‚Äúyoung Skywalker‚Äù. Yet, Savvy to Vader being Obi-Wan, the Emperor lays the smack down by continually enraging Luke whenever he mentions what became of his father. This is one of the reasons for lying to Luke; since the boy doesn‚Äôt know it‚Äôs not true, he gets angrier and angrier, stepping ever closer to the Dark Side. When Luke tells the Sith Master that he will not be converted like his father was, the Emperor replies, ‚ÄúOh, no, my young Jedi. You will find that it is you who are mistaken‚Ä¶ about a great many things.‚Äù &gt; &gt;So the cards are stacked, and Vader pulls out a nice hand. Why does Yoda play along? Luke‚Äôs becoming a pansy-ass, afraid of facing Vader a second time. Telling the boy that Vader was full of shit isn‚Äôt going to do much, since Luke would then realize that he‚Äôs physically weaker than the Sith Lord, as well as mentally weaker. In the confrontation needed to bring down Vader, Luke needed to feel strong, without showing dark side traits of anger, which would have been inevitable side-effects of knowing Vader lied. Since time was important here, Yoda plays along with the gag, knowing that it will bring Luke back to face Vader. &gt; &gt;When Yoda is first considering teaching Luke, he notes to Ben that the boy is reckless. Ben agrees, but reminds Yoda that when he was younger, he too was reckless. Yet from Episode one, we know that Obi-Wan was not reckless at all, always doing everything as in the book, always telling Qui-Gon that he ought not be reckless. Anakin, however, is another story. &gt; &gt;When you put all this together, it makes sense that Obi-Wan never tells Luke outright that Vader is his father, because Obi-Wan doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want to lie to his son more than he has to. Only when Yoda lies to Luke, in order to inspire him on, does Obi-Wan give in, agreeing in order to work with Yoda, to make Luke get up and fight. Yoda doesn‚Äôt even tell Luke right off the bat, hesitating to lie to the boy. Only when asked again, on his deathbed, does he decide to do what will stir the boy on: lie to him. The conflict, however, is evident. Some scheme had to take place, and at every point, something was done to keep Luke from going over the edge, or to make him stronger. Even if that meant lying to him, and even if it meant keeping the weight on Kenobi√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s shoulders. The glance Ben gave Luke when he was struck down by Vader was the perfect combination of sorrow and faith; ‚ÄúI am your father.‚Äù &gt; &gt;When Yoda dies, he doesn‚Äôt appear to Luke in the patented Jedi ghost method. In fact, Obi-Wan is the only one who does, and Obi-Wan wasn‚Äôt even his damned Master, aside from the brief period of time on the Millennium Falcon. Obi-Wan appears because he is concerned about his son, because he is watching from beyond to guide his child. Perhaps only family can project for long periods of time, or repeatedly, because Yoda was clearly the wiser Jedi, certainly the one with more experience and former influence, but he does not guide Luke after his death at all. And, who knows whether or not Luke finds out the truth after Episode six; Return of the Jedi only takes us so far, and since the latter books are fake Star Wars canon, it‚Äôs quite possible that the truth is unveiled to Luke later on.",‚Ñ¢

(I consider the Love commandment sufficient).  What I experienced was more like playing a role in the 2nd coming (i.e. your Messiah). I had an extremely tough week (coincidental in time with Passover) from an existential point of view, my body was twitching in the beginning of the week and at the end of the week, where it (here in Sweden) was two Annunciation Days in a row, both Saturday and Sunday, which is very very rare. I also felt a deep identity with God, and when I was speaking with people it was like they were very far away. I also, through introspection like a religious experience, made my first approach to a Love based artificial intelligence algorithm, which I wrote about here in Dec [""Love as a universal concept""](http://rolandorre.se/?p=15) (as well as in my thesis in 2003). (The actual shape of the algorithm is presented here [Love driven revolutionary AI](http://rolandorre.se/?p=47).  The reasons why I considered converting to your religion were mostly that the manifestation of my experiences I associated with Israel. The crescendo was strong twitches in my legs, an incredible strong ""lifting force"" of my brain, and a very strong religious experience, which I had never had before like that, apart from a (completely different one) visual[1] with cold sweat and convulsions during 3 min in 1987, when I saw a picture I didn't recognize until a couple of years ago).  My experiences started 23:00 Swedish time, which is 24:00 Israelian time, and lasted until 00:00 Swedish time, ie. 01:00 Israelian time. (My girlfriend was very worried, she didn't understand what was happening, no worries I said). This event was when the Swedish calender changed from ""Announciation day""  (Marie beb√•delsedag) to ""Announciation Lady Day"" (Jungfru Marie beb√•delsedag) (here a [Swedish calender](http://www.dinstartsida.se/almanacka.asp?datum=2000-03-01) over March 2000. Now I noticed that the Sunday also was ""Emanuel"" day which was the name of my father. For my own also have the names Adam Immanuel, which I'm now using as initials as it fits very well with the project I'm working on which is based upon AI (artificial Intelligence).  The project I'm working on I started the same month in March 2000, and it has since then maturated with methods, trademarks etc, even patents (although I'm a patent abolishonist) and the methods I developed during my PhD and later as consultant for WHO will be used within this project with goal to start the technological evolution with a highly ethical agenda, with goal to make every human being on the planet ultra hip and creative, that is, every being should be able to follow their own will without being told by someone else how to be. This is one [brief presentation](http://wish-it.se/hip/singularity2) I made in January. Some parts will be released this year. One of the goals is for instance to generalize the concept of free software to [free hardware](http://wish-it.se/freecomputer).  PS. later that year I told my house doctor about the experience, and he immediately wanted to do CRT and NMR imaging of my brain , and the results perfect, not one single artifact  ! :-)   ---------------------------   1. It was first in 2009 I finally recognized the picture I had seen 1987 over my whole wall, like 2x2m, during around 3 min, with heavy convulsions and cold sweat, the picture[2] I finally recognized was the front page of Keith Curtis book [After the Software Wars](http://keithcu.com/wordpress/?page_id=407), but without the title.      2. the picture on the front page of the book is part of a larger artwork made by Nils Seifert named [Metropolis 2208](http://thmc.deviantart.com/art/Metropolis-2208-75669429)    [3]      3. the name Metropolis also was a direct association to the highly visionary and dystopic scenario in Fritz Lang's movie [Metropolis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolis_%28film%29) from 1927, where advaced technology and artificial intelligence was use to control and supervise people instead of helping people. This movie I have during many years used as a metaphor over today's dystopic society where technology is used just like that, to control and supervise people, instead of helping people. Something that we will change‚ù£ ",‚ù£

So naturally being the nice guy i am made sure she didnt fall. so i put my arm out and stopd her from falling and she turned around to say thanks and BOOM, Right when we looked into each others eyes it was love at first sight, Both of us had the biggest smile on out faces and are eyes were gleaming. We started to talk for a bit during lotus grooving out still when she reached out to pull me in closer. The show ends and we both look at each other just smiling, so happy because it was an INSTANT connection and i swear LOVE at first sight. finialy she said she had to go and she blew me a kiss and i was just stund and she walked off and i was just in so much shock i didnt follow her (And i am a little shy [:p] ). The next day i woke up at around nine in the morning, just as i step out side of my tent i see her down the road walking and i was going to go run after her but i was so nervous i chickend out [:(] i was super bummed all day and i didnt know what to do, i wanted to find her so i spent almost all day looking for her but alas nothing [:(] later that day i was heading twords Moe.'s set at night. I was walking inbetween where all the stand of food are untill you hit the main stage and i felt something hit my arm. So i go to turn around to say sorry and BOOM. There she is, smiling at me and with thos amazing gleaming eyes. my face instantly light up and i ran over to her, my heart RACING because im so nervous. i get to her and she gives me the best hug ever, my heart instantly melted. i asked her if she was going to moe. because she was headed the opposit direction, In that perfect soft voice she said she was going back to her camp sight to drop off her tail (One of thos really long tails with the bells on it) and the she was going to go to moe. OBVIOUSLY inviting me to go with her to her camp really quick then go to moe. together. then i froze up! i wanted to ask if i could go with her but i got so nervous andi just said ""well when you get back look for my totem and come by me okay?"" then she said she promised she would and walked back and i went on the hill to wait for her. I never saw her..i looked everywhere the rest of the night and the next day and nothing [:(] i had three chances but i blew it just.

t5_2qh0u,osolono,1338421842,"Why you're not winning ladies:   &gt;**The neurotic mind**  &gt;**some symptoms**  &gt;Have you ever felt nervous? Sweaty palms. Constantly clearing your throat. Making awkward eye contact. Tight shoulders. Hands stuffed in your pockets and arms crossed. Want to know what you look like?  &gt;Surprisingly‚Äîeven though a hundred emotions may rage inside you‚Äîyour face remains blank. Every thought and emotion is subdued and filtered as you constantly fight to conceal your emotions.  &gt;For example, a coworker may tell a hilarious joke, causing you to inadvertently break into a smile. But because you‚Äôre terrified of offending others, you quickly recompose your face to hide this naked emotion. Trying to open up to strangers feels like stretching a rubber band; sooner or later your anxious thoughts drive you back to your original closed position. Your secret box of thoughts and emotions remains buried under a mountain of terrifying ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù questions.   &gt;You keep your inner self hidden behind a carefully controlled facade. Like a seasoned poker player, you hide any hints of your desires. By keeping your eyes from squinting, you suppress telltale signs of joy and anger. Your unmoving brow betrays no hint of worry or ecstasy. You mumble your words. You speak in a dry monotone. Joy, sorrow, curiosity, and anger all sound the same coming out of your mouth as one thought grips you: I am afraid of being discovered.    &gt;**How To Spot A Serial Killer**  &gt;The eyes are supposed to act as the General of the face, conveying the bulk of your emotions. But your eyes don‚Äôt know where to look because you lack direction. Instead, they anxiously dart around, refusing to cooperate with the lower half of your face. Smiles look forced and uncomfortable because your eyes refuse to squint. Excitement is subdued by their refusal to widen.  &gt;Although the mouth is the most animated part of the face by necessity, it produces a sterile monotone. You might think that this bland expression is normal. But it requires tremendous effort to maintain an expressionless demeanor. Restraining a constant river of thoughts and emotions is a full-time job.  &gt;As a socially incompetent person, you constantly worry about living up to the expectations of others. You are always comparing yourself to more successful people. You never feel good enough, smart enough, or athletic enough. Because you fear failure, you‚Äôre afraid to try anything new or do things differently.  &gt;This type of neurotic mind-set forces you to focus on yourself. You worry about how you look, how you dress, what others think of your family and friends, what kind of car you drive, where you live, how you sound, what school you attend, what job you hold, etc. This self-absorbed perspective makes it extremely difficult to pay attention to what others are saying. Since you keep beating yourself up, you‚Äôre quick to criticize others. You assume that others judge you in the same negative light that you judge them. You hesitate to express yourself because you‚Äôre afraid of risking rejection. Since you hold back what you‚Äôre really thinking, people can‚Äôt relate to you. You don‚Äôt feel close to them. You keep thinking, ‚ÄúNobody gets me!‚Äù   &gt;Like most people, you gravitate towards convenience; you look for those who play the same video games, participate in the same sports, attend the same classes, or share the same career. The underlying assumption is that finding people with similar interests will lead to strong relationships. But by focusing on these external factors instead of revealing your personal thoughts and feelings, you fail to meet the social needs of others. Ultimately, this leads to unsatisfying relationships.   &gt;While you may have friends, these relationships remain optional rather than necessary. Often times instead of talking to people you‚Äôll over indulge in external activities. These activities are more convenient than putting in the effort to build relationships; and they help compensate for your lack of human contact. For example, millions of guys play Xbox and PC games and have developed entire electronic cultures to accommodate this abnormal habit. There are electronic-sport leagues, online gaming forums, professional gamer video streams, fan sites, and gaming slang‚Äîall of this becomes a substitute for face-to-face social interaction.  &gt;And when it comes to flirting, you‚Äôre terrified. Most of the time, you wind up in the dreaded FriendZone‚Ñ¢. This leaves you either resenting girls for not wanting such a ‚Äúgreat guy‚Äù or feeling helpless to maintain a romantic relationship. Since you don‚Äôt get enough sex, you resort to porn to address your sexual needs. And even if you manage to get a girlfriend, her attraction to you never lasts‚Äîyou‚Äôre always the one getting dumped. Whenever you spot couples spending time together, you either envy or despise them.  &gt;You also have serious problems with getting your expectations met. Directly stating your needs to anyone feels embarrassing. This causes you to sweep confrontations under the rug. At school and at work, others violate your expectations with impunity, leaving you with a general sense of frustration.   &gt;**Why are you like this?**   &gt;‚ÄúYesterday, my mom and I went grocery shopping. As I pulled out a shopping cart, I looked back and saw this little girl with her mommy looking right at me. I had no idea why they were just standing there looking expectantly at me instead of getting their own cart from the other rows. I wheeled my cart around them and keep rolling. As soon as we were out of earshot, my mom exploded.  &gt;‚ÄòJames! Have some decency! You should‚Äôve handed your cart over to those two ladies. They were counting on you to be a gentleman!‚Äô   &gt;‚ÄòWhy can‚Äôt they get their own carts?‚Äô I asked.  &gt;She sighed with the exasperation that only a mother knows. ‚ÄòJames, I‚Äôve taught you better than this.‚Äô  &gt;As she kept walking, I froze to the spot as memories of her decade-long nagging flashed into my mind: ‚ÄòYou can‚Äôt just say that to a girl! I don‚Äôt care if she was rude or stupid or you think she deserved it. That‚Äôs not what a gentleman does!‚Äô ; ‚ÄòYou should always hold the door open for me‚ÄîI‚Äôm a lady.‚Äô ; ‚ÄòJames, you can‚Äôt criticize your friend‚Äôs opinion! Everyone has their own beliefs, and you‚Äôre not entitled to question them just because you think they‚Äôre wrong.‚Äô  &gt;Suddenly, it felt like a dam had broken inside me. A pent-up flood of realization came pouring out:   &gt;**THIS IS WHERE I GOT MY NEUROSIS.**   &gt;My mom did her best to raise me, but she had no fucking clue how to do it. Since my father‚Äôs too scared to stand up to her, she‚Äôs been ruling over both of us for years. This has gradually reduced me to a neurotic mess, cowering under my own self-censorship.   &gt;I am terrified of being criticized by the world and not living up to its expectations.‚Äù  &gt;*But why?*  &gt;Why do you feel like you must constantly monitor yourself? Why do you treat women as if they are better than you? Why does talking to people seem like such a massive chore?   &gt;Like James, you too have been worn down by society‚Äôs constant reprimands.

Bodies don't magically do something other than what biology dicates. Bodies are formed through and because of their biology, not in spite of it. It's like you're saying ""But if the blueprints say it should be a castle when the finished structure is a barn, then why would people assume it's a barn.""  &gt; A biologist would not call them intersexed. Doctors would not call them intersexed.  If we're still talking about hermaphrodites, then yes, a biologist or a doctor or an anatomist would. If genitalia of both sexes are present, that is by definition intersexed. Not as simple male or female, or possibly both if you like, but not strictly and exactly either.  From [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex#Sex_determination):          Sometimes an organism's development is intermediate between male and female, a condition called intersex.  &gt; Hermaphrodites have on their birth certificate the gender they will be raised, not 'intersex' or 'genderqueer'.  That's because birth certificates give weight to social consideration, not strict biological adherence.  &gt; That is a biological fact, they are considered female  [Female (‚ôÄ) is the sex of an organism, or a part of an organism, which produces non-mobile ova (egg cells).](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female) Female is a *sex*, not a gender. Sure, people can be born sterile or have hysterectomies, but ""female"" is defined, not a matter of mindset or personality.

Never fear what will become of you, depend on no one. Only the moment you reject all help are you freed.‚Äù      * ‚ÄúThousands of candles can be lit from a single candle, and the life of the candle will not be shortened. Happiness never decreases by being shared.‚Äù      The most important of everything in Buddhism is the first quote.  &gt; Does Christianity require that one believes in an unchanging soul/self?      Do not ask what ""Christianity"" requires, use your logic and common sense, this is also what Jesus asked for, follow the truth! The world is full of deceivers.  &gt; What of the afterlife?      afaik Jesus did not say much about this, and if he said, then it is still not to be taken for granted that he actually said it. The reason why he didn't talk about it is most likely due to not actually knowing. He only knew that if you follow the truth (i.e. what makes sense and is logical) then you are going to live forever.  Seen pragmatically from a computer scientist's view, this makes sense, and is consistent with the Buddhist view, as what defines you, is your software, the architecture of your brain logic, which makes you behave well, or behave bad.  A good architecture can be reused, and further refined. However, as you certainly don't know anyone who can in detail remember their previous life, your worries about afterlife should be no worry.  Heaven is here, this is the only thing we can take for granted, and if heaven is here on Earth, the afterlife is consistent with your belief about reincarnation.  It is said in the end of the Revelation    * 21:1 And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea.   * 21:2 And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.   * 21:3 And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God.  So don't worry, everything of your Buddhist experiences is compatible with pure Christian Love and logic.   FYI: I had a visual experience, my only such experience during my whole life, in 1987,  when I saw a picture I didn't recognize until a couple of years ago).  The following is an extract of a [comment about this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/uai4r/wife_says_shell_divorce_me_if_i_become_christian/c4u6a5g) I made yesterday:   1. It was first in 2009 I finally recognized the picture I had seen 1987 over my whole wall, like 2x2m, during around 3 min, with heavy convulsions and cold sweat, the picture[2] I finally recognized was the front page of Keith Curtis book [After the Software Wars](http://keithcu.com/wordpress/?page_id=407), but without the title.      2. the picture on the front page of the book is part of a larger artwork made by Nils Seifert named [Metropolis 2208](http://thmc.deviantart.com/art/Metropolis-2208-75669429)    [3]      3. the name Metropolis also was a direct association to the highly visionary and dystopic scenario in Fritz Lang's movie [Metropolis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolis_%28film%29) from 1927, where advaced technology and artificial intelligence was use to control and supervise people instead of helping people.

Their website (under the carefully-worded section daintily called *Why are GMs more expensive?*) opens with the proud statement that by lasting three to five times longer than regular pointe shoes, GMs are actually cheaper. Which, perhaps, they are. But they're also really really crap.   Why is something so expensive so very crap, you ask? I don't know. Maybe the materials required to manufacture an elastometric box and cushioning made from utherane foam is more expensive than paper machier. That, and the fact that convincing an already-suspicious clientele takes work. Clearly, making them from utherane foam and telling us about it isn't enough. No, they have to use Rogers Corporation's Poron¬Æ 4000 cushioning and the American Podiatric Association's Seal of Acceptance doesn't come cheap. Nor does forking out the dough for poor students at the University of Massachusetts (who really, I can imagine, have better things to do) to measure how many more relev√©s en pointe a GM shoe can endure versus a regular pointe shoe. Again, yes, more relev√©s= longer-lasting shoe. Virtually unbreakable shanks will do that. But I'm still not quite convinced that's a price to pay for broken ankles. (Eh, I suppose I have to admit the overall quality of the satin is also very high- mine never ripped and shredded like it did with all other shoes)  TIL bullshitting people gets really really expensive.

Drawing on empirical research, we propose eight principles designed to help consumers get more happiness for their money. Specifically, we suggest that consumers should:  (1) buy more experiences and fewer material goods;   (2) use their money to benefit others rather than themselves;   (3) buy many small pleasures rather than fewer large ones;   (4) eschew extended warranties and other forms of overpriced insurance;   (5) delay consumption;  (6) consider how peripheral features of their purchases may affect their day-to-day lives;   (7) beware of comparison shopping; and   (8) pay close attention to the happiness of others.  ¬© 2011 Society for Consumer Psychology.
