Where is the benchmark proof? The 6770M from benchmarks can run all those games on medium or above general settings with an 720P or above resolution from the looks of it.   And then the 660Ti and 670? Those are $300-$400 cards not including the PSU that may need to be upgraded.  Crysis 1 will run pretty well.

t5_2t5sa,Isenki,1349075881,"http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:portlandtribune.com/pt-rss/9-news/114604-schools-beat-the-drum-for-equity  If you hate HuffPo as much as I do, here's the cached version of the original Portland Tribune article.   --------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------  Verenice Gutierrez picks up on the subtle language of racism every day.  Take the peanut butter sandwich, a seemingly innocent example a teacher used in a lesson last school year.  “What about Somali or Hispanic students, who might not eat sandwiches?” says Gutierrez, principal at Harvey Scott K-8 School, a diverse school of 500 students in Northeast Portland’s Cully neighborhood.  “Another way would be to say: ‘Americans eat peanut butter and jelly, do you have anything like that?’ Let them tell you. Maybe they eat torta. Or pita.”  Guitierrez, along with all of Portland Public Schools’ principals, will start the new school year off this week by drilling in on the language of “Courageous Conversations,” the district-wide equity training being implemented in every building in phases during the past few years.  Through intensive staff trainings, frequent staff meetings, classroom observations and other initiatives, the premise is that if educators can understand their own “white privilege,” then they can change their teaching practices to boost minority students’ performance.  Last Wednesday, the first day of the school year for staff, for example, the first item of business for teachers at Scott School was to have a Courageous Conversation — to examine a news article and discuss the “white privilege” it conveys.  Most of the staff are on board, but there is some opposition to a drum class being offered to middle school boys of color at Scott School.  Fifty percent of the students at Scott are Hispanic; another 15 percent are black and 9 percent are Asian. Eighty-five percent are eligible for free or reduced-price meals.  Chuck Barber, who also offers boys’ drum corps at Vernon and Faubion schools in Northeast Portland, approached Gutierrez last year to start up a lunch-time drum class for black and Latino boys once a week. This year, it’ll expand to two classes a week, to accommodate new boys as well as those with experience.  At least one parent has a problem with the the class, saying it amounts to “blatant discrimination and equity of women, Asians, whites and Native Americans.”  “This ‘club’ was approved by the administration, and any girls who complained were brushed off and it was not addressed,” the parent wrote anonymously.  Gutierrez denies that any students were turned away from the drum corps, and vehemently rejects any suggestion that it is discrimination to offer a club catering to minority boys.  “When white people do it, it is not a problem, but if it’s for kids of color, then it’s a problem?” says Gutierrez, 40, an El Paso, Texas, native whose parents were Mexican immigrants. “Break it down for me. That’s your white privilege, and your whiteness.”   Like many if not all of PPS’ leaders, Gutierrez has gone through California-based consultant Glenn Singleton’s “Coaching for Educational Equity,” a weeklong seminar on race and how it affects life; she’s also become an “affiliate,” certified to teach the equity curriculum; and she serves on the district’s administrative committee to address systematic racism, a group that meets every other week.  “Our focus school and our Superintendent’s mandate that we improve education for students of color, particularly Black and Brown boys, will provide us with many opportunities to use the protocols of Courageous Conversations in data teams, team meetings, staff meetings, and conversations amongst one another,” Guitierrez’ letter to staff reads.  Equity training aside, Scott School must teach the same number of students with fewer teachers and resources. Down five full-time positions this year, including two reading specialists, Gutierrez is trying desperately do more with less.  “My first year as principal, I looked at the data and found that the eighth-graders that year, a third of them were going to Madison (High School) at about a third-grade level,” she told the Tribune. “I said, ‘This is completely unacceptable.’ “  That led to her adopting what she calls the school’s “Big Hairy Audacious Goal”: that every student will make two years’ growth in one year’s time in reading, writing and math.  Last year, teachers set out to tackle that goal, meeting in teams to look at data and coming up with creative ways to target their instruction.  “We want to teach them to be critical thinkers,” Gutierrez says.  The results, by the end of the year, were promising, she says. The biggest achievement was among the kindergarteners: All but three of the 63 students met their benchmarks at the end of the year.  Among the other grades, there was “tremendous growth in pockets,” she says. “Now we need to make it happen school wide.”  Despite that year of work, Oregon’s Department of Education just last month identified Scott as a “focus school,” one that performs among the state’s lowest 15 percent.  Five other PPS schools are state-designated focus schools as well: Jefferson High; CÃ©sar ChÃ¡vez K-8; and Rigler, Whitman and Woodmere elementary schools.  The designation comes with $5,000 per school and a state-appointed coach who’ll work with each school team on an improvement plan.  Another six PPS schools, which ranked among the state’s lowest 5 percent, are newly designated as “priority” schools: Madison and Roosevelt High; Ockley Green K-8; and King, Rosa Parks and Woodlawn elementary schools.  “I’m excited by the fact that we’re designated a focus school by the state,” Gutierrez says. “It’s an added layer of accountability.”  She’s so motivated to see growth that she’s adopted a new school vision: to be an “academic beacon” for Northeast Portland, where students achieve at high academic levels in two languages.  “This isn’t for the weak,” she says. “We have less resources. We can’t impact that. I want to walk away from Scott when my tenure is done and be able to say that school is achieving just as well as Alameda or Sabin, or any other school in the city. Why not?” ",©

Usually when people say this they don't really talk about strength but about the combination of several different mechanical properties like tensile strength, density, extensibility, toughness etc.  But what makes spider silk even more interesting is that it is biocompatible and biodegradable, which gives us the option to embed this foreign material in the human body.  &gt;And, what would be the implications of being shot point blank wearing the bulletproof skin™?

t5_2v6m6,cherylwheeler,1349152331,"We are faced with innumerable stressors, from pressures we put on ourselves (internal) to the expectations of others (external). When we find an activity that helps us to escape these pressures we may act like “a kid in a candy store” and go overboard. Our pressures seem to disappear! And we increase the time in that magical activity that frees us from life’s pressures and provides escape.   Anything can become addictive; food, gambling, exercise, sex, spending, internet, video/computer games (for example; World of Warcraft®, Call of Duty®, and Everquest®). Whatever form of escapism, if the activity regulates mood and relieves emotional pressures and needs to be re-enacted time and time again – then the behavior has become addictive. Addiction and its behaviors become a routine way of coping, as in the cycle of addiction. Once a behavior has become addictive the pattern or cycle is predictable.   Understanding the Cycle of Addiction  1)	Stressor - such as unrealistic expectations from others or ourselves, fear of rejection/failure, life pressures, etc. Anything that triggers us to feeling vulnerable and weakening our reserve. 2)	Acting out - internet activity of any kind that segregates us from the outside world (family, work, school, responsibilities) and has escalated to more and more time away from others and our responsibilities. 3)	Guilt &amp; Remorse – this always occurs, promising ourselves or others that we will never “do it” again. Momentarily recognizing the damage. The questions of why begin to take over. 4)	Shame &amp; Depression – along with recognition, a deep sense of shame and depression.  5)	Recommitment – promise to limit time on internet, spend more time with family, recommitment to ourselves and others.   6)	Performance – we may be able to keep the commitment and promises, but only until the cycle starts up at the next stressor, which activates the entire cycle, ultimately repeating addictive cycle over and over.  Learning how the addiction cycle works, and how to replace the self-medicating addictive behavior with healthy coping skills are among the treatment protocol.

Internet Addiction Test  The Internet Addiction Test is the first validated and reliable measure of addictive use of the Internet. Developed by Dr. Kimberly Young, the IAT is a 20-item questionnaire that measures mild, moderate, and severe levels of Internet Addiction. To assess your level of addiction, answer the following questions using this scale (add your score as you go):  1 = Rarely. 2 = Occasionally. 3 = Frequently. 4 = Often. 5 = Always.  1.	How often do you find that you stay on-line longer than you intended? 2.	How often do you neglect household chores to spend more time on-line? 3.	How often do you prefer the excitement of the Internet to intimacy with your partner? 4.	How often do you form new relationships with fellow on-line users? 5.	How often do others in your life complain to you about the amount of time you spend on-line? 6.	How often do your grades or school work suffers because of the amount of time you spend on-line? 7.	How often do you check your e-mail before something else that you need to do? 8.	How often does your job performance or productivity suffer because of the Internet? 9.	How often do you become defensive or secretive when anyone asks you what you do on-line? 10.	How often do you find yourself anticipating when you will go on-line again? 11.	How often do you fear that life without the Internet would be boring, empty, and joyless? 12.	How often do you snap, yell, or act annoyed if someone bothers you while you are on-line? 13.	How often do you lose sleep due to late-night log-ins? 14.	How often do you feel preoccupied with the Internet when off-line, or fantasize about being on-line? 15.	How often do you feel preoccupied with the Internet when off-line, or fantasize about being on-line? 16.	How often do you find yourself saying ""just a few more minutes"" when on-line? 17.	How often do you try to cut down the amount of time you spend on-line and fail? 18.	How often do you try to hide how long you've been on-line? 19.	How often do you choose to spend more time on-line over going out with others? 20.	How often do you feel depressed, moody, or nervous when you are off-line, which goes away once you are back on-line?  20 - 49 points: You are an average on-line user. You may surf the Web a bit too long at times, but you have control over your usage.  50 -79 points: You are experiencing occasional or frequent problems because of the Internet. You should consider their full impact on your life.  80 - 100 points: Your Internet usage is causing significant problems in your life. You should evaluate the impact of the Internet on your life and address the problems directly caused by your Internet usage.

Right, but I'm certain this doesn't apply - that's why you can record (to Garageband or Audacity) using the Real Tone™ cable.   &gt; But I argue that since your drives can be designed around using the exact same protocol as interfaces that are already industry standard then you should be able to allow use of those interfaces but only provide consistent support with your proprietary interface.  I'd inclined to agree with you here (although it *is* only $20 or $30 for the official cable) but that's not what frustrated me about these comments.   The claim was that no other cable *can* do what the Rocksmith Real Tone™ cable does - this thread isn't the first time I've heard the claim that the Real Tone™ cable is ""special"" and somehow some kind of magic tone detection goes on inside it. This is untrue, from everything I know about software engineering, and it just annoys me to see fanbois spouting incorrect information and getting upvoted for it (note: when I commented incorrect answers were upvoted to about +2, other responses where downvoted about the same).

t5_2qh8e,Flashnewb,1349178376,"The problem is worse than you might think. It extends beyond TV dramas and well into the film industry, too - and right into the heart of the indie film scene. That, right there, is heartbreaking.  In America, you have the big studios churning out the same action blockbusters and dumb kulture comedies year after year. But to balance that, you've got some seriously talented independent players that will frequently swoop in with something off the wall and interesting. Just last night I went and saw *Looper*, for example - a movie that would never have made it off the mark in Australia. The same with TV over there. Sure, there are the Law and Order factory studios, but cable TV allows for some true quality to come through as well. No Australian production company would ever have let something like Breaking Bad go beyond the initial pitch.  And why? Because Australian film and TV *must conform to the formula*. All the films. All the TV. You know the formula so well by now that you can be forgiven for letting it become invisible on a day-to-day basis, but it is constantly there. Boiled down, it looks like this:  ""Everything was fine for [protagonist] until the horrific tragedy made them go crazy for a while [and do something regrettable].""  This describes a lot of film and TV, of course, including American and British shows. But it is the stunningly predictable and concrete way that it's executed in Australia that makes it so noteworthy.   It's adaptable, of course, and has clear levels of applicability. Soaps like Neighbours and Home and Away, for example, settle for superficial 'horrific tragedies'. Every so often there'll be an external disaster and someone will 'leave the bay forever' or whatever. It's kind of unfair to criticise these shows. They're Neighbours and Home and Away, ffs. Then you step up to weekly dramas, and the horrific tragedy gets more 'edgy' . Here, the female lead will nearly always, like clockwork, have a miscarriage. The male lead will suffer from some kind of degenerative mental illness. That's non-negotiable. You write a weekly drama? Cool, when's the bipolar storyline kick in?   Then you've got the weekly cop shows. Here, the female leads will be treated like shit by their husbands, without fail, no matter which side of the law they're on. If they're single, they're lesbians, prostitutes or about to die. Male Criminal Leads will suffer from Weekly Drama Mental Disorder Disorder (WDMDD) and Male Cop Leads will have their marriage fall apart because they're treating their wives so shitly and having affairs left, right and centre in a *desperate* airing of their flaws for the audience.  Mini-Series' absolutely, without question, must be biographies of famous Australians. Just as this public figure hits their stride, usually about a third of the way through, all the tragedy that occurred in that famous persons life will be depicted as happening at once so that they have something to claw their way back from. They will hurt the ones they love the most as a result of these tragedies. You can give these a free pass if you like because they're 'based on true events', but they will only get made if they conform to the formula.  Then you have Australian film. A market that consists almost entirely of independent filmmakers financed by government bodies like Screen Australia. Far from leading to a wealth of diverse stories, the formula has become so pervasive that we end up with the same movies over and over again. I'm not sure who to blame for this, but fuck, someone needs to a rap on the knuckles for it.  A quick note: Comedies often divert from the formula for the sole reason that it's hard to have a funny movie about horrible people treating each other horribly and then dying.  Is the film a drama? It is about a dysfunctional family. The father is an abusive layabout, the mother is manipulative and both parents love the siblings of the protagonist more than the protagonist, who probably has an undiscovered mental illness. The protagonist will have a close friend who dies unexpectedly, usually in a car accident or by sudden suicide. Drugs almost always figure into things - usually sparking the Horrific Tragedy™.  Is the film Sci-Fi, Adventure, Action, Fantasy or Romance? No it is not, because Australia does not make those movies.  Independent film makers are supposed to be a safeguard against shitty formulas from taking over the entire film industry of a country. Heartbreakingly, our country seems to be sold on the idea that your movie must have a countdown timer to the sudden death of a main character and that people don't have depth unless they're saddled with a clunky treatment of a serious cognitive disorder.   *Tomorrow When The War Began* and *The Sapphires* diverged from the formula recently and they became the two strongest opening weekend films in the country. People are crying out for something new. If not original, at least just **not** the same thing again. People are sick of going to see Australian dramas and *knowing* that they're going to be depressed for most of the film. People don't want another fucking series of fucking *Underbelly*.  But that's all we will get for some time yet, because the formula is running things and has, under its influence, an army of executives with more money than taste.   Consider that, right now, there are thousands on *thousands* of genuinely talented and outrageously creative people languishing in utter obscurity while we are watching yet another TV show that relies on a voice over to explain the shitty plot. While we have to put up with writers who can't stretch their imagination beyond putting 'ness' at the end of the word 'bad' to come up with a subtitle for the show that's taking up most of the production budget, some genius with our very own *Breaking Bad* or *The Wire* is being told he should consider cutting his losses and getting a job at Woolies.  Something needs to change. Quickly. Everyone seen the *Neverending Story*? We need to give the Childlike Empress a new name before we all get swallowed up by the Nothing and there's no imagination left in the world.  **tl;dr** - The Formula is in control. Do not adjust your sets.",™

t5_2qi0s,ACMEexp,1349189147,"A well thought out and articulated argument [nathanvgreene](http://www.reddit.com/user/nathanvgreene). Kudos.  However, IMO it tends to lose ground over the discussion of intellectual property. Although, the ""true"" mold may/should be protected, this particular frame is not the final mold of the Venge™. Therefore, not the Venge™.   Moreover, as mentioned by [patarck](http://www.reddit.com/user/patarck):  &gt;The mold used for this model is a Venge prototype mold (second stage I believe) that was sold to a company called Mathot, whom then licensed the mold to many different manufacturers.  All on the up and up, read legitimate. If this design was to be protected, and the risks of copies/counterfeits/replicas/homages mitigated then the onus lies solely on the parent company/owner of the design. Secondly, the owner of this design should not have **sold** the mold to another company without a proper protection plan in place. That said, a company cannot protect its intellectual property assets at all if it *chooses* to **sell** its design to any person or company in China. China does not recognize intellectual property rights or copyrights in the same manner as the Western world.  As to the mention of:  &gt;a relationship with a LBS/local dealer are some of the integral parts of the cycling industry.  I agree wholeheartedly. However, a frame purchase is not what develops a relationship. Nor does it genuinely give the LBS a substantial profit gain. Especially, if the frame comes from a big brand (e.g. Specialized, Trek, Giant etc.). Markup being generally very little for those brands. As parts break, or get upgraded, this is where the relationship becomes invaluable. Markup is greater on parts, and therefore profit margins for LBS's greater. It can be worth paying the extra markups at your LBS for professional attention, service, and advice, as well as the all to familiar ""I gotta have it now"". Also worth mentioning, repeat business to your LBS may also, at the LBS's discretion, may yield some fabulous loyalty deals, quick-fix freebies, first-dibs on closeout/liquidation goodies, and general awesome connections with people in this freakin' awesome hobby/lifestyle.",™

t5_2qqjc,redditopus,1349209833,"The counterpoint, by two psychologists: http://escholar.salve.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1016&amp;context=jift  In particular:  &gt;Mathematical and scientific abilities have been assessed with a range of measures, including standardized tests, cognitive tasks, and performance in school. The central measure of advanced mathematical skills in the United States is the mathematical scale of the SAT (SAT-M). Halpern, Wai, and Saw (2005) note that males outperform females on the SAT-M by about 40 points and the difference in scores has remained stable over the last 25 years. This supposedly intractable gap provides key evidence for claims of inherent sex differences in abilities. But is the gap universal? International assessments have provided valuable data on whether the sex difference observed in the United States is present in other countries. The Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) assesses literacy, mathematics, and problem-solving in 15-year-olds every three years (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, OECD, 2004). In its 2003 assessment of 250,000 students from 41 countries, males scored higher than females in mathematical tests in 27 countries out of 40. In one country, Iceland, girls outperformed boys; indeed, girls in Iceland even outperformed boys in the U.S. Furthermore, the results for problem-solving tests indicated very few sex differences and, when present, they favored girls.  &gt;Therefore, it appears that a male advantage in mathematics and problem-solving is not universal and varies greatly across countries. Based on these findings, the report concludes that “The wide variation in gender gaps among countries suggests that the current differences are not the inevitable outcomes of differences between young males and females and that effective policies and practices can overcome what were long taken to be the inevitable outcomes of differences between males and females in interests, learning styles and, even, in underlying capacities [italics added]” (OECD, 2004, p. 97). Furthermore, in contrast to standardized measures, females tend to have better grades than males in all subjects, including advanced mathematical courses (Kimball, 1989). Indeed, research has shown that the SAT-M scores underpredict the performance of females relative to males in college mathematical courses, both introductory and advanced (Chipman, 2005). For example, Wainer &amp; Steinberg (1992) found that females who received the same grades as males in the same university math courses had received scores nearly 50 points lower on the SAT exam.  &gt;Thus, the data demonstrate that a male advantage in mathematics is not a solid finding, with different measures yielding different outcomes. Therefore, it is not clear that sex differences in standardized test scores indicate differences in aptitude. Indeed, the creators of the SAT exam themselves are mystified about exactly what the SAT measures. When it first debuted in 1901, SAT stood for Scholastic Achievement Test. In 1941, it was renamed by the College Board as the Scholastic Aptitude Test. In 1990, when “faced with the fact that a test that can be very successfully prepared for is not a true test of ability” (PrepMe© 2001-2005, History of SAT), the SAT was renamed the Scholastic Assessment Test. Finally, in 1994, since ‘assessment test’ is redundant, the test became simply the SAT. The College Board explained “Please note that SAT is not an initialism. It does not stand for anything” (PrepMe© 2001-2005, History of SAT). Given that it is not clear, even to the developers themselves, what the ‘A’ stands for, what can be said about what the test measures? Furthermore, because sex differences on standardized math tests first emerge in late adolescence (see Spelke, 2005, for a recent review), these differences can reflect the influence of a variety of experiential factors, such as academic curricula, stereotype threat, and socialization...  Regarding the fact that this study was done on infants:  &gt;As we have discussed, sex differences in math and science abilities can be due to biological and/or experiential factors: nature and nurture are always confounded. By studying very young children, experiential factors can be reduced or eliminated. Because studies indicate that even during infancy, male and female infants receive differential treatment (reviewed by Golombok &amp; Hines, 2002), the only way to identify biological sex differences is by eliminating experience entirely and focusing on newborns. There is only one study that examines sex differences in relevant behaviors in newborns (Connellan, Baron-Cohen, Wheelright, Batki, &amp; Ahluwalia, 2000), and this study has become the cornerstone of the argument for innate predispositions. According to Steven Pinker, a leading scholar on cognition and language, “Simon Baron-Cohen has given us some of the most sophisticated research on the nature and origin of sex differences in cognition” (Pinker, 2005). We therefore focus on this study, carefully examining its theoretical rationale, methodology, and conclusions in detail.   &gt;Theoretical Rationale  &gt;The theoretical rationale stems from Simon Baron-Cohen’s work on autism (Baron-Cohen, Knickmeyer, &amp; Belmonte, 2005), a condition characterized by social impairment and heightened interest in the physical world. Baron-Cohen views autism, more common in males than in females, as a manifestation of an “extreme male brain”. He further posits that, in general, male cognition reflects an emphasis on analysis and mechanical understanding – what Baron-Cohen terms ‘systemizing.’ Systemizing abilities, in turn, would provide the basis for scientific reasoning. In contrast, female cognition reflects an emphasis on social understanding -- what Baron-Cohen terms ‘empathizing.’ According to Baron-Cohen (2003; Baron-Cohen et al., 2005), these sex differences in ‘systemizing’ and ‘empathizing’ capacities stem from prenatal ‘hardwiring’ in the brain and are present at birth. Strong support for this theory would be provided by demonstrating that sex differences in these capacities do indeed begin at birth. Unfortunately, although newborns provide an opportunity to examine biological predispositions prior to experience, they are in fact very difficult to study. They drift among various states of consciousness in an unpredictable manner, going from an alert state to crying to sleeping within a very short time. Their attention spans are extremely variable (Fogel, 2001). To address some of these difficulties, standard methodologies are typically used. However, despite an existing body of research on newborn perceptual preferences, Connellan and Baron-Cohen’s newborn study does not use this methodology, or address the findings from this body of research. We next address these concerns in an in-depth critique of Connellan et al.’s (2000) study.  &gt;Methodology  &gt;Connellan et al. assume that sex differences in infants’ interest in ‘social’ versus ‘mechanical’ stimuli are precursors to future sex differences in empathizing and systemizing abilities. They therefore compared one-day-old girls’ and boys’ interest in ‘social’ versus ‘mechanical’ stimuli. The social stimulus was the real, live, face of the first author of the study, Jennifer Connellan. The mechanical stimulus was a mobile – a face-sized ball composed of various facial features that were haphazardly arranged. The stimuli were presented sequentially to infants who were tested at their mothers’ bedsides or in the neonatal nursery, lying on their backs in their cribs or held in their parents’ laps. Differences in time spent looking at the face or the mobile were considered indices of preferences.  &gt;This study is fraught with methodological problems:  &gt;1) Validity: The investigators assumed that one-day-old newborns’ preferences for faces or mobiles reflect social versus mechanical intelligence. However, it is not clear that looking at a face or a mobile does, in fact, reflect later social or mechanical abilities. Furthermore, even in newborns, it is unclear that a face represents a ‘social’ stimulus. *Recent studies suggest that newborn preferences for face patterns compared to other patterns represent a perceptual bias for top-heavy patterns, rather than preferences for faces per se (Macchi-Cassia, Turati, &amp; Simion, 2004).* Indeed, other studies indicate that newborns actually prefer looking at these kinds of patterns to looking at real faces (Simion, Macchi-Cassia, Turati, &amp; Valenza, 2001). It is not until 3 months of age that infants prefer real faces to face-like (top heavy) patterns (Turati, Valenza, Leo, &amp; Simion, 2005).  &gt;2) Confounds/lack of control: The face and mobile differed on several crucial variables. The face in fact consists of several properties. It consists of movement and expressions, and is attached to a live person who exudes warmth and odors. As all of these vary together, it is impossible to know which of these dimensions underlie any preferences for the ‘face.’ Again, it is not clear the preferences for the face can be attributed to its ‘social’ dimension. Furthermore, infants were tested in different settings. Slight changes in the settings could lead to differences in the perception of the two stimuli, making them appear more or less top heavy under different conditions. Preferences for one stimulus or the other could simply reflect these different perspectives.   &gt;3) Experimenter expectancies: A striking design flaw is that the face stimulus was that of the researcher herself. Experimenter and subject expectancies are well-documented, and require stringent controls. In this case, the researcher could unconsciously move her face or tilt her head in ways that increase its salience, which is particular problematic given that in many cases she was aware of the newborn’s sex (Edge, 2005, Simon Baron-Cohen).   &gt;4) Operational definition of the dependent variable: Curiously, the dependent variable itself was incorrectly defined. The authors report that “looking time was calculated as a proportion of total looking time” (p. 115). However, examination of the results indicates that looking time to each stimulus was actually compared to the presentation time for each. In order to interpret findings, the definition of the dependent variable must be clear and precise.   &gt;5) Statistics. Finally, we noticed a serious mistake in the number of degrees of freedom used in the statistical analysis that compared girls’ looking time to the face and mobile. It is very possible that the correct number would not have yielded significant results. Precision in statistical analyses is a fundamental component of scientific investigation. We wonder why this obvious error was overlooked in the peer review process for journal publication. These are all serious methodological problems. There are numerous investigations that adopt a standard research paradigm for investigating perceptual preferences: all infants are tested in the same, controlled setting, stimuli are presented simultaneously to control for the fragility in newborn attention span and fluidity of newborn states, and specific procedures are used to prevent parents and researchers from influencing infants’ behavior. In studies of sex differences, experimenters are blind to the sex of the infants. Finally, the dependent variable is measured more precisely – in terms of actual looking time (the difference in the amount of time that infants looked at one stimulus compared to another) rather than relative looking time. It is unclear why the only study of sex differences in perceptual preferences in newborns ignored these standard procedures.   &gt;Findings and Conclusion The only significant findings were that boys looked at the mobile more than girls did, and girls looked at the face more than they looked at the mobile. Much was made of these findings in the paper’s conclusion: the authors state that they “demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt [italics added] that these [sex] differences are in part biological in origin.” (p. 114). This is a strong claim, with serious implications. The methodological problems already provide reasonable doubt. We next show that the findings themselves are equivocal in regard to this claim. The authors conclude that “We have demonstrated that at 1 day old, human neonates demonstrate sexual dimorphism in both social and mechanical perception. Male infants show a stronger interest in mechanical objects, while female infants show a stronger interest in the face” (Connellan et al., 2000, p. 116). However, this conclusion incorporates comparisons that were not significant: Boys did not look at the mobile more than the face; they only looked at the mobile more than girls did, and girls did not look at the face more than boys did; they only looked at the face more than the mobile. The title of the paper, “Sex Differences in Human Neonatal Social Perception,” is in fact misleading, as the findings indicated no sex difference in looking time to the face. Nevertheless, these findings are misinterpreted and misstated in many different papers as evidence for newborn sex differences in social and mechanical preferences.  Baron-Cohen is not without his flaws.",©

t5_2qh5b,gnomicarchitecture,1349213008,"So, I think you misread the first argument, it has the form modus ponens, namely:  1. A→P 2. A 3. Therefore, P.   The argument was, copy pasting:  1. It is clearly false that we ought to be totally dependent on the government. 2. If 1, then socialism is false. 3. Ergo socialism is false.  Since 2 is a conditional where the antecedent is the first premise, and ""socialism is false"" is the consequent, the conclusion logically follows (because the first premise is a premise).   Your argument, however, is a good example of why denying the antecedent is a fallacy. (Just because A is false, and A→B, this doesn't imply B is false).   Although your reconstruction of argument 2 is nice as its own argument, formally speaking, I think it doesn't capture the inductive gist of the argument. What I was going for was (where i is an arbitrarily small real constant and R is the positive reals):  1. ∀x∈R (x is too small→x+i is too small) &amp; i∈R 2. ∀x∈R∀k∈R ((P(x)&amp;(P(x)→P(x+k)))→∀x∃y x&lt;y &amp; P(y) 3. ∀x (x is too small↔P(x)) (Px: x has a property).  3. ∀x∈R ((x+i)∈R) (&amp;E 1 and closure of addition)  4. Ergo ∀x∈R ∃y x&lt;y &amp; y is too small (from 1, 2, 3 and 4.)  The conclusion entails that for any income anyone makes, there is a bigger income which is too small to be acceptable (e.g. requires government handouts).   2 is technically not induction, it's a weaker sort of entailment (just gets you the same property for some number larger than n, doesn't get you the property for every n). I could have done this with n+1 and the natural numbers, but then this would have been implausible (one dollar doesn't seem small enough a jump for us to be justified in saying that *anything* that makes it true that n dollars is not enough makes it true that n+1 dollars isn't enough. I could reasonably say ""they should get 100 dollars, not 101 dollars"". I could however, not reasonably say ""they should get 100 dollars, not 100 dollars plus an arbitrarily small fraction"". So I am actually not sure how to run this argument with induction mathematically (e.g. it seems like it's not as simple as induction, but 2 is clearly true anyway).   Edit: Regarding your edit, we need only make i sufficiently small to show that any reason for giving x a handout is a reason for giving x+i a handout. Also, note that in my formal argument I switch x and i (i is the constant and x is the variable, sorry about that. I just figured it would be better to use x as a variable as that is standard).

It is a campaign of terror - highly effective terror - regardless of what noble progressive sentiments one wishes to believe reside in the heart of the leader ordering it. And that's precisely why the report, to its great credit, uses that term to describe the Obama policy: the drone campaign ""terrorizes men, women, and children"".  &gt;Along the same lines, note that the report confirms what had already been previously documented: the Obama campaign's despicable (and likely criminal) targeting of rescuers who arrive to provide aid to the victims of the original strike. Noting that even funerals of drone victims have been targeted under Obama, the report documents that the US has ""made family members afraid to attend funerals"". The result of this tactic is as predictable as it is heinous:  &gt;&gt;""Secondary strikes have discouraged average civilians from coming to one another's rescue, and even inhibited the provision of emergency medical assistance from humanitarian workers.""   &gt;In the hierarchy of war crimes, deliberately targeting rescuers and funerals - so that aid workers are petrified to treat the wounded and family members are intimidated out of mourning their loved ones - ranks rather high, to put that mildly. Indeed, the US itself has long maintained that such ""secondary strikes"" are a prime hallmark of some of the world's most despised terrorist groups.  &gt;Perhaps worst of all, the report details at length that the prime excuse offered by Obama defenders for this continuous killing - it Keeps Us Safe™ by killing The Terrorists™ - is dubious ""at best""; indeed, the opposite is more likely true.",™

You grab that bottle of pills and take them all. Laying down, holding the letter to your chest, you close your eyes for the very last time. A few hours later, your little brother knocks on your door to come tell you dinners ready. You don’t answer, so he walks in. All he sees is you laying on your bed, so he thinks you’re asleep. He tells your mom this. Your mom goes to your room to wake you up. She notices something is odd. She grabs the paper in your hand and reads it. Sobbing, she tries to wake you up. She’s screaming your name. Your brother, so confused, runs to go tell Dad that “Mommy is crying and sissy won’t wake up.” Your dad runs to your room. He looks at your mom, crying, holding the letter to her chest, sitting next to your lifeless body. It hits him, what’s going on, and he screams. He screams and throws something at the wall. And then, falling to his knees, he starts to cry. Your mom crawls over to him, and they sit there, holding each other, crying. The next day at school, there’s an announcement. The principal tells everyone about your suicide. It takes a few seconds for it to sink in, and once it does, everyone goes silent. Everyone blames themselves. Your teachers think they were too hard on you. Those mean popular girls, they think of all the things they’ve said to you.

Your ex boyfriend, the one that you told everything to, that broke up with you.. He can’t handle it. He breaks down and starts crying, and runs out of the school. Your friends? They’re sobbing too, wondering how they could never see that anything was wrong, wishing they could have helped you before it was too late. And your best friend? She’s in shock. She can’t believe it. She knew what you were going through, but she never thought it would get that bad… Bad enough for you to end it. She can’t cry, she can’t feel anything. She stands up, walks out of the classroom, and just sinks to the floor. Shaking, screaming, but no tears coming out. It’s a few days later, at your funeral. The whole town came. Everyone knew you, that girl with the bright smile and bubbly personality. The one that was always there for them, the shoulder to cry on. Lots of people talk about all the good memories they had with you, there were a lot. Everyone’s crying, your little brother still doesn’t know you killed yourself, he’s too young. Your parents just said you died. It hurts him, a lot. You were his big sister, you were supposed to always be there for him. Your best friend, she stays strong through the entire service, but as soon as they start lowering your casket into the ground, she just loses it. She cries and cries and doesn’t stop for days. It’s two years later. The whole school talks to a counselor/therapist at least once a week. Your teachers all quit their job. Those mean girls have eating disorders now. That boy that used to tease you cuts himself. Your ex boyfriend doesn’t know how to love anymore and just sleeps around with girls. Your friends all go into depression. Your best friend? She tried to kill herself. She didn’t succeed like you did, but she tried…your brother? He finally found out the truth about your death. He self harms, he cries at night, he does exactly what you did for years leading up to your suicide. Your parents? Their marriage fell apart. Your dad became a workaholic to distract himself from your death. Your mom got diagnosed with depression and just lays in bed all day. People care. You may not think so, but they do.

t5_2ss5b,YummyMeatballs,1349220300,"&gt;Doesn't necessarily work that way, though, because the person who ""gets"" only sex when she wants a meaningful relationship can wind up worse off emotionally than the person who doesn't.  I think that'd be a very difficult thing to determine - is the person worse of emotionally because of the meaningless sex or other factors? The only thing we can say for sure, it doesn't take much to *not* get sex or become FA in the traditional sense, simply stop having sex with people. It's not such a straight forward option for others.  &gt;At least the FA who has never had someone at all still has the chance of having someone make the move on him. The person who is continually used for sex, on the other hand, has a hard time trusting anyone when it comes to romance.  I don't think it works that way, an FA likely has just as much chance of developing trust issues, I don't think you need a slew of one night stands/casual hook-ups for that.   It seems to me that a lot of non-FAs have some very strange ideas about Forever-Aloneness™. I've had a good friend lament about his suffering of being without a girlfriend for a year or two, I feel bad for the guy - it's tough, but when he says that it's not as bad for me, never having had a relationship, it gets a little frustrating. He seemed to think that never having had one meant I didn't know what I was missing. It's a common attitude I see on reddit too and while I know that's not what you're saying, it at least appears on the face of it to come from the same place. It can be really quite frustrating :).",™

t5_2qmjp,GrumpyOwlGamery,1349232995,"The Keep is probably overkill for 1-5 games if they aren't expandable but that isn't all we are offering. A Magic Chamber or Great Chambers as a safer way to travel would work and might still get all 5 games in. I used to only play Magic the Gathering™ back in the day and you can bet I took it with me everywhere. At $25 for a Magic Chamber on our Kickstarter you can bet I would have jumped all over that. I spent more than that on binders for my trading cards, Rook™ cases for my playing decks, and a backpack to toss them all in.   Games like Arkham Horror™ and Dominion™ are shining examples of where this system works particularly well and there are a lot of games like these. Setting these games up are a nightmare without organization, extremely wasteful of space, and a significant investment so to get the value from them you should really play them more. Dominion™ drops from 8 boxes to 4 Magic Chambers when the cards are unsleeved. Ticket to Ride™ drops to about 6 boxes into one Great Chamber.   The intent is not to put 100 games in it (I'm probably in a similar boat as you have over 100 games). You can't really travel with that - but you might be able to travel with 20% or more of your collection. If organization is important to you to you, I could see someone using the organizers for the most played games in their collection (if larger than what would fit in a Keep) and having 1 Keep as the transportation piece. Then its plug and play - place the games kept in organizers into mobilizer and go.  Many of our backers don't have cars and get around exclusively through public transportation. You won't carry 8 Dominion™ boxes, you'll either resort to DIY (which I've done previously), you'll use a something like our system, or you won't take it.   So let's look at some of the audience shall we:  * Gamers that play expandable games  * Gamers that play collectible card games or living cards games and will have to get a storage options anyways  * Gamer that regularly use public transportation  * Gamers that regularly travel with their games  * Gamers that frequent conventions  * Gamers that like to stick with one or a few games  * Gamers that would rather carry a case instead of a box  * Gamers that don't want their games damaged  * Gamers that like organization - their way  * Gamers that want a more efficient use of space  * Gamers that have gone DIY for a game only to stop playing the game and have a useless case  I can keep going, but I think you get the idea.   I'm not sure why the incredulous reactions of ""I don't get it"" and ""who's the audience"". Some people might want to organize their games and travel with them in a solution *designed* to do just that. We are offering that solution. ",™

t5_2skrn,Zeta_Metroid,1349236553,"**“I appreciate your thought out reply my friend. I am going to take a guess that you are an evangelical christian. You don't have to say if this is true or not - but I know that it was the way I thought when I was an evangelical Christian”**  I’m a Christian, but not evangelical  **“When you have lots of sex, sex lose its power over you.”**  That’s exactly my point. You’re going to make yourself incapable of having a true romantic relationship and become little more than a hedonistic sociopath. Unless you reverse your course, that’s your destination  **“I care about it alot less and I only want to use sex to achieve my goal. 50 Lays. Then after that I can get a girlfriend and form a bond…”**  No, you can’t. That’s like saying after you burn yourself and kill all the nerves in your skin, then you can go enjoy a massage. Its not going to work, the damage will be too severe  **“…and the nice thing is - it won't be a bond based on sex it will be based on more important things…”**  I’m not saying you should only care about somebody because you’re doing them. Sex is just a link in the chain that’ll form your bond with that person. And you’re rusting that link very quickly  **“I will be able to make a clearheaded decision.”**  If you can’t do that now, what makes you think you’ll be able to then? Cravings for power don’t lessen. They just get worse. Its like a black hole: you need to avoid it before you get into the event horizon. Then there’s no return  **“You can't disagree with that Zeta_Metroid. If sex is the only thing (or the main thing) keeping your bond together, then you have a very questionable bond.”**  It solidifies and strengthens it, its not what its based on. It should be based on love But the more you use people as means to an end, the less of that you’ll be able to have.   **“You get really good social skills and know how to make people like you.”**  That’s nothing special. Even empty psychopaths can do that. They’re some of the best at it, in fact.   You can develop those skills without damaging yourself and other people.  **“I would never have motivation to do these things outside of sex. This positively affects everyone around me.”**  Isn’t the desire to positively effect everyone around you motivation enough? That’s why I’m doing nofap   **“You get really good at sex…I can't give a girl orgasms yet…”**  See the problem? You can only be truly good at it if you develop your skills and style with one person. Which would be harder to face: a doubles tennis team that had been training all their lives together, or one you’d just randomly assembled? (Assuming all the players have been practicing for an equal amount of time)  **“Girls don't have power over you.”**  This is a big red flag: the center of narcissism is a need for power and control. Now you’re venturing into getting that over other people, you’re in big danger of going down a bad road you can’t come back from  **“They can't withhold sex to make you do what they want.”**  You need it that badly?  **“They can't be rude to you or else you will simply get another girl.”**  Sometimes people get snappy. That might indicate she’s having a rough time or something’s upsetting her. Instead of being focused on yourself, you should care more about what’s going on with her  (Obviously if someone is mean 24/7 for no reason and they’re abusive you shouldn’t be with them, but occasional rudeness is normal and human)  **“This has the odd benefit of making you more desirable to them.”**  Or your delusions of grandeur are making you think that.  **“Putting a girl on a pedestal is bad for everyone.”**  In an ideal world, everyone would put everyone on a pedestal. Including themselves. How can you expect to have a life-long, special relationship with someone if you don’t treat them specially?  **“I have become a much better individual through learning to get laid.”**  It sounds like you’re turning into an empty pleasurebot.  **“NOT TRUE.”**  It is by your own admission! You yourself said it becomes less significant. Look at yourself now: how differently do you feel about those women before and after you have sex with them?.    **“there are no statistics to back this up”**  The more sexual partners someone’s had in the past, the more they’re likely to have in the future and the less likely they are to develop a lasting long-term relationship.  **“a bond is something that is either strong or week depending upon how much work you and your partner put into it.”**  To do good work, you need good tools. You’re damaging your tools.  **“why should i trust you?”**  Because every single piece of data is on my side  **“has this been your personal experience or the experience of someone you know?”**  It’s a simple statistical fact that the more partners you have, the less likely you are to ever have a lasting relationship with a single person.  **“can you think of any times when this might not be true?”**  Not that I’ve seen actual research on  **“seducing isn't manipulating. i am not making anyone do what they don't want to do.”**  I said you were on the way to becoming a manipulative narcissist, it doesn’t sound like you’re quite there yet. But that’s where this road goes. You're already treating humans like means to achieve power for its own sake  **“as far as being narcissistic, yes that is probably true haha”**  This is good! Its very good you can recognize and admit that problem, just like we all have about fapping. That’s the only way we could fix our lives; we had to recognize we were, deep down, weak hedonists and fight that. You’ve done the first part of that, why not begin the second?  **“I've formed good relationships with guys who want the same thing.”**  That’s like people who cut themselves bonding over it! If they help each other to quit its good, but it sounds like you guys are just encouraging each other to make the slices deeper and deeper  **“So far, no bad has come from it. “**  You’ve hurt the ability for sex to form bonds between you and someone else.  **“you have just summed up what seduction is. it's supposed to feel natural like you are just clicking.”**  Then why do you need 49 other women and a bunch of celebrities?  **“people having been sleeping with multiple partners throughout history.”**  And its never had good results! It was only necessary in ancient times because you needed children to be able to survive. But let’s look at your examples:  **“abraham, isaac, jacob, david, solomon”**  Abraham sleeping with another woman had awful results. It screwed Hagar (the woman he slept with) and the child they had, Ishmael, over. It also screwed over Isaac because Ishmael molested him. That, of course, would cause a lot of grief for Abraham and his wife Sarah.  Isaac stayed faithful to Rebecca, there’s no record of him having sex with anybody else.   Jacob got tricked into having two wives, if you recall. He was in love with and was marrying Rachel. But, on their wedding night, Leah’s father tricked him into having sex with her. Not long after, he married Rachel. And it was an absolute disaster. Leah was miserable. Genesis 29:31 talks about how God “saw that Leah was not loved”, and in the next verse she talks about how “the LORD has seen my misery”. The next chapter is filled with the two sisters fighting, Genesis 30:1 begins with Rachel being “jealous of her sister”, and the first half is all about their feuding with each other.  David’s desire for another woman wound up with him having her husband killed, and the child he had with her dieing.  Solomon’s wives, according to 1 Kings 11, “led him astray” by “turning his heart towards other gods”. To the point that 1 Kings 11:7 says “On a hill east of Jerusalem, Solomon built a high place for Chemosh the detestable god of Moab, and for Molek the detestable god of the Ammonites.”. Molek’s followers worshipped him by sacrificing children! And he built altars to evil gods like that all around Israel.   So, in all your examples, having multiple partners was an absolute disaster. It brought nothing but misery and death.  **“…they were not punished or condemned for this…”**  Only because polygamy was sometimes necessary. In their world, you needed children to survive. Like Rachel said to Jacob in Genesis 30:1, “’Give me children, or I’ll die!’”. It was far from the ideal though.   But you, obviously, don’t need to sleep with 50 women and some celebrities to survive. So the damage is just that: pure damage with no gain  Also, you didn’t quite directly respond to my comment that “people are counting on you, validation is not worth destruction”. The number of people counting on us is so immense we don’t have single words in English to describe it. Your “ripples” are going to have an enormous effect on them all; and forever once everything gets resurrected. Is some “validation” really worth forsaking all that? You said you like having a positive impact on people, after all. You can do that without damaging anyone. Believe it or not, its been the experience of a lot of people here (including myself!) that not fapping greatly improves your social skills!  So, how about it? You don't need to have sex with 50 women. In fact, you need to not do it. So why not do the smart thing? Please♥?  ",♥

Try using a moisturizer that your skin absorbs well, and that keeps you hydrated without being oily. It's good to apply moisturizer after every wash, morning and night. Just be careful not to use anything with SPF at night, as that can be bad for your skin.    Here is some relevant info I posted a while ago on r/makeupaddiction, (which, by the way, is a fabulous community):  I have a very oily nose and chin and the rest of my face is pretty dry. My favorite daytime moisturizers: Origins A Perfect World™ SPF 25, ~$40 and Neutrogena Oil-Free Moisture SPF 15, ~$10.  The Origins one works better and smells better, but it's pretty expensive, so I frequently go half and half with the Neutrogena. They both work well on their own.

Even if you use another locomotive to shunt a cold, not-working steam loco around in the train yard - you have to open a few valves on the steam loco first, so the pistons can move back and forth without resistance as it trundles along. (This makes some truly weird noises and usually sends water spurting out from some pipes every half-revolution).   When one of our locos recently broke its cylinder lining while pulling passengers, the train couldn't be moved until some mechanics walked up the track to manually unbolt the piston connecting rod from the axles in the middle of the forest.

t5_2qzb6,ferroh,1349269514,"A lot of the millionaires who ""didn't come from much"" were still extremely lucky.  For example Bill Gates did not inherit his fortune, but he was very lucky in the sense that he was one of perhaps one dozen kids in the world that had access to a computer when he was in Grade 8.  An even better example might be the jewish lawyers that were forced to start their own firms at a time when you could not get a job as a jew -- even with a harvard degree -- because jews were ostracized. Those jews' law firms then became the most successful firms today. If those jews were given a 9-5 job like so many others, they would not have had to create law firms. This is the circumstance and chance I'm talking about -- which is not necessarily being given wealth from your relatives or having wealth walk to your doorstep one day.  What is *possible* is a little bit different -- but I think it's important to realize that even with your best effort, not all of your success is within your control. People seem to punish themselves more now than ever because The American Dream™ says you can be as wealthy as you want if you just put your mind to it! But in reality, in 99.9% of cases it takes more than just effort.  There has been some discussion that people in medieval times were actually happier on average than people in America today, because they accepted their place in the world -- and most peasants had no dreams of becoming a billionaire -- so they were happy with what they had. I think many of us could learn a lesson from that.",™

t5_2suyx,Raerth,1349276746,"The actual number is 72 subreddits, but stattit doesn't count private or low-traffic subreddits.  Subreddits are user-created. Think of it like a nightclub. You could open a wildly successful nightclub, but you (the mod) is not responsible for it beign great, that's the people who come to your club. However the clubbers don't get an opportunity to say ""I don't like how this club is run, lets replace the owner!"" Instead they should not attened that club, and if they care enough they should start their own club. If their club is better, then people will go to it. (© *violentacrez*)  This has happened loads of times. I mod in /r/Trees, which was started because people hated /r/Marijuana. Now /r/Trees is the largest weed-focused subreddit.  Other examples enclude /r/weightroom formed from /r/fitness, /r/squaredcircle from /r/wrestling, and so forth.  Not many people make successful subreddits because growing a subreddit is genuinely hard. The mods need to put in a lot of effort to making their subreddit a good place to be and attract subscribers. Eventually, if you get big enough, you might become default. /r/Music became default about a year ago, for 5 years it wasn't default and me and the other mods put a lot of effort into trying to make it good.  I have a guide to creating a subreddit [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/raerth/comments/f2xrr/raerths_moderation_guide/) which will help you if you want to try.  Having democratically elected mods would be terrible for another reason. Imagine if you could go to a subreddit and evict the mods. /r/Atheism vastly outnumbers /r/Christianity. How would you prevent an invasion from taking over the subreddit? With groups like SRS and others on the net, there is vast potential for people to invade and evict mods if you this were allowed. Any niche subculture would be at risk.  Reddit is a place for people to create subreddits based on whatever they want. You can create your own subreddit with whatever rules you like. No one should be allowed to take that away from you if they don't agree, instead they should leave themselves and set up their own section. There's a metric fuckton of political subreddits for this very reason.",©

First, you are heating the soap, which softens it. Second, you are heating the air and water trapped inside the soap, causing the water to vaporize and the air to expand. The expanding gases push on the softened soap, causing it to expand and become a foam. Popping popcorn works in much the same way. When you microwave Ivory™, the appearance of the soap is changed, but no chemical reaction occurs. This is an example of a physical change. It also demonstrates Charles' Law, which states the volume of a gas increases with its temperature. The microwaves impart energy into the soap, water, and air molecules, causing them to move faster and further away from each other. The result is that the soap puffs up. Other brands of soap don't contain as much whipped air and simply melt in the microwave.",™
t5_2qh5b,gnomicarchitecture,1349291700,"So I used classical first order logic (L_2) plus some arithmetical operators from peano arithmetic, these are fairly standard I think:  x&lt;y means x is less than y (in CFOL+PA) or if you like LessThan(x,y) for a cleaner syntax.   x=y is defined in CFOL (equals).   P(x) just means x has a property F (to be more rigorous, a mathematical property F).   x+y is just the sum of the numbers x and y, and is undefined when x and y are not real numbers (they are in this case since the domain is reals and i is a real constant).   So the argument was:  1. ∀x∈R (x is too small→x+i is too small) &amp; i∈R 2. ∀x∈R∀k∈R ((P(x)&amp;(P(x)→P(x+k)))→∀x∃y x&lt;y &amp; P(y) 3. ∀x (x is too small↔P(x)) (Px: x has a property). 4. ∀x∈R ((x+i)∈R) (&amp;E 1 and closure of addition) 5. Ergo ∀x∈R ∃y x&lt;y &amp; y is too small (from 1, 2, 3 and 4.)  Translated into literal english this would read :  1. {For all x that are an element of the positive real numbers (R), [if x is too small (as in too small an income for a person to not get government help), then x+i is too small]} *and* [i is a particular real number] 2. For all x and for all k which are in R, if x has a specific property F and x having a specific property F implies that x+k has that specific property F, then for every real number x there exists a number bigger than x (y) which has the specific property F.  3. For every x, if x is too small, then x has a specific property F (being too small is a particular property).  4. For every real number x, x+i  is also a real number. (this is from &amp; elimination on premise 1 since 1 states that i is a particular real number, and it's also from the closure of addition, which entails that a real number plus a real number is a new real number. This is not a stated premise since it's true in the language we are using [CFOL + PA]) 5. So for every real number x, there exists a y which is bigger than x and y is too small.   The conclusion again entails that no matter how large a person's income is (any real number x), there is a bigger income (y) which is still too small for the person to not get government aid.   ",↔

t5_2r9po,Acromir,1349293635,"###Traits  ##Shadow Arts (15) * 2♦ when you stealth * +1s Stealth duration  ##Acrobatics * Might (15s) on dodge * Swiftness (2s) on dodge * Vigor (10s) on heal * Healing when you spend initiative * 20 endurance returned after dodging * +10% damage when endurance isn't full  ##Trickery * Fury, Might, and Swiftness (10s) on Steal * Vigor (15s) and two boons stolen on Steal * +3 max initiative. * +1% damage per initiative  ###Weapons  ##Sword/Dagger  This is the weapon I use almost all the time. The spam attack does the exact same damage as the dagger spam attack, but it has a cripple/weakness and it's a frontal AOE. Infiltrator's Strike is the world's best stun break. It breaks stuns, moves you out of danger, and removes a condition as a bonus. It's spammable, which is unique to us. Always have a Shadow Return available. Stuns never last more than half a second on me. Flanking Strike is meh, and only gets very rare use to remove a boon.  Dancing Dagger is a great cripple, and actually does decent AoE damage. Cloak and Dagger is central to this build. I use CnD -&gt; Tactical Strike for a daze frequently. I average a 2s daze every 5-6s. This is a great deal of support for the group, and extremely powerful in PvP. CnD actually does great damage, and Tactical Strike deals slightly more than a #1 attack. Additionally, this works well with the trait that heals when you spend initiative. It heals you as if you use 5♦ (which means 300-500 health), but only costs 3♦ with the initiative return.  ##Shortbow  90% of the time I use this weapon is in a large-scale DE (or just shadowstepping to cover ground). It has great AoE and it's ranged, so it's perfect for dancing around the outside of a large fight. This is also good for the rare occasion that I have to kite something.  ###Skills  ##Hide in Shadows  I pick this as my heal almost all the time. Withdraw heals for more, but I hate having to give up my positioning. The 4s stealth is great, and the 2♦ is a bonus. I also love the condition removal, and the regen is made more powerful by my focus on boon duration.  ##Caltrops  Amazing. AoE bleeding and cripple. It's great for control, kiting, or damage. Useful in all situations.  ##Shadowy refuge  It's a great defensive and support tool. Can be used for an easy revive, or to heal your allies. It's also a great aggro control, which is something that only Thieves and Mesmers can do. All kinds of other uses, like ambushing in WvW or harvesting a node surrounded by enemies.  ##Scorpion Wire  I usually use Scorpion Wire here. It's nice to have a fast interrupt, and the pull/knockdown is a great control. I'll often immediately follow up with Cloak and Dagger, which is a near-guaranteed hit.  However, I'll replace this skill as the situation warrants. Smoke Screen, Blinding Powder, Shadowstep, Skale Venom, and Haste all find their way into this slot at one time or another.  ##Elite  Up do you. I normally go with thieve's guild, but Dagger Storm or a racial works fine too. I'm a fan of Reaper Of Grenth.  ###Gear  ##Stats  This is a power-heavy build, although I get a decent amount of crit chance/damage. I use some vit/toughness, but a big part of my defense comes from dodging, stealth, and CC so it's not that important. Condition damage is a low priority, as my main weapon set doesn't have any damaging conditions. I pick up a little bit for Caltrops and Shortbow, though.  ##Runes I go with two Runes of the Water and two Runes of the Monk. Those each give +15% boon duration, which is a huge bonus both to me solo and to my group support ability. Right now, I'm using two Runes of the Hoelbrak for my last two, which gives +20% might duration for even more might stacking.  ##Sigils I go with a Sigil of Fire, which has a chance to trigger an AoE flame blast on crit. The flame blast triggers a minimum of once a fight, and often several times. It does surprisingly high damage and is very useful. My dagger has a Sigil of Force for an easy +5% damage.  ##Food  I go with Chocolate Omnomberry Cream. +40% magic find, and +20% boon duration. For a boon-heavy build, that's all-around epic, and the MF is just a nice bonus. I'll occasionally use a heal-on-crit food if I'm having trouble staying up.  ###Play Style  ##Damage  This build does decent sustained damage, especially AoE. I get good passive damage bonuses from initiative and my endurance not being full. Additionally, I can keep up to 10 stacks of might up on myself from dodging. I get 58% fury uptime from Steal, which is great and meshes with my Sigil of Fire. My spike damage does not exist, and I'll never compare to the damage of a glass-cannon build, especially against a single target. However, I have decent sustained single-target, and strong AoE damage. My damage is more than enough for a build with so much defense, control, and support.  ##Defenses  I never get hit. If the enemy can uncross their eyes long enough to take a swing at me, I'm either in stealth or I dodge every attack. I almost instantly break every stun on me, so good luck trying to control me. This build excels against the CC/Burst noobs in PvP. Charge -&gt; Frenzy -&gt; Hundred Blades warriors get destroyed by this build. As soon as they knock me down, I break it and Shadow Return away. Then I stealth, dodge-roll towards them, and stun them for the rest of their Frenzy. Those one-trick-ponies melt if you can counter their one trick.  Defense is very active, and very fun. You go down fast if you take a lot of hits, but you can heal yourself up very well and you have all kinds of methods to keep from getting hit. You can dodge every 3s with perma-Vigor and the endurance return, and get constant healing every time you spend initiative.  ##Support  The backbone of my support is the boons I grant from Steal. In PvP (no food) that's 16s of fury and swiftness, 18s of might, 24s of vigor, and two stolen boons to everyone near me. In PvE, I get another 20% duration from foods (total of +80% boon duration!). I also get tons of control, and active aggro control or revives with stealth is awesome.  ##Mobility  The mobility this build offers is great. You can get 100% uptime with swiftness. Combine that with Infiltrator's Arrow, and I can cover ground faster than any other class/spec. Combine *that* with stealth, and I rarely die because of all my escape tools. PROTIP: If you're just covering ground, use steal on a white-name enemy. It'll give you vigor (which requires you to successfully steal, unlike the fury/might/swiftness), but won't put you in combat.  ...  That went longer than I expected, but oh well. I'm gonna bookmark this post so I can use it as copy pasta later. Too bad that GW2Skills is down; that would have saved me some time :P",♦

t5_2qhbe,Rishodi,1349304433,"What's your source for that claim? The rotors should certainly be inspected when the pads are replaced to determine their condition. But if the rotor surfaces are within spec (smooth and flat, with no scores, pits, cracks, etc., uniform, and above the minimum thickness), then resurfacing or replacing is just a waste of money. Here's what the [Motorist Assurance Program (MAP) Standards of Service](http://www.monroebrakes.com/support/map-standards-of-service) says:  &gt;Friction material replacement does not require rotor reconditioning unless other justifications exist. Monroe® recomends rotor reconditioning if they exceed factory specifications in 1) lateral run-out, 2) thickness variations, 3) have a groove in excess of .060 inch.  **Edit**: Just to add to the above, resurfacing rotors unnecessarily also reduces their remaining service life, since it decreases the thickness of the rotor.   And here are [guidelines from General Motors](http://www.motor.com/magazine/pdfs/062004_04.pdf) on the topic:  &gt;Brake rotors should only be turned when one of the following rotor surface conditions exist: severe scoring with depth in excess of 1.5mm or 0.060 inch, pulsation from excessive lateral runout of more than 0.080mm or 0.003 inch, thickness variation in excess of 0.025mm or 0.001 inch or excessive corrosion on rotor braking surfaces.",®

Many of Sikh's Guru's Saints were Tortured to death and Beheaded, Burned alive, Boiled alive, Cemented in walls etc  Some of the names i can recall  [Bhai Dayal Dass Boiled Alive by Muslim Ruler Aurangzeb](http://www.sikh-history.com/sikhhist/martyrs/dyaldass.html)  [Bhai Mati Das Chopped alive](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhai_Mati_Das)  [Guru Tegh Bahadur 9th Guru Ji of Sikhs Known by Hindus as **Hindu di Chadr** i.e Blanket of Hindus was beheaded on the streets of Delhi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martyrdom_of_Guru_Tegh_Bahadar#Execution)  **The Five Holocausts In Four Centuries**  **1st Sikh Holocaust, 1658**  Muslim Emperor Auragnzeb, on becoming the ruler of India in 1658, started a campaign to forcibly convert the entire population of India to his faith.  **2nd Sikh Holocaust, 1708-1716**  The Mughal Emperors Bahadur Shah and Farrukh Shah took steps to try to exterminate the Sikhs by issuing a number of edicts instructing the population. An estimated 25,000 Sikhs died as a result.  **3rd Sikh Holocaust 1726-1746**  During this period bounties were placed on the heads of Sikhs. Information on the whereabouts of a Sikh was worth 10 Rupees, a dead Sikh was worth 50 and a Sikh brought alive to the Lahore markets was worth 100.  **4th Sikh Holocaust 1758-1767**  Ahmed Shah Abdali invaded India from Afghanistan and despised the Sikhs who constantly resisted his armies. For revenge, he sent an army of over 150,000 men to attack a much smaller band of Sikhs.Over 30,000 Sikhs were killed in February 1762.  This event is known in Sikh history as the Wadaa Ghallughara, or the Great Holocaust.  **5th Sikh Holocaust 1947**  India was given independence from the British but the Sikh homeland, Panjab, was carved in two between India and the new Pakistan.  Sikhs found themselves being run out of their own homes by Muslim mobs.  An estimated 40% of the Sikh population became homeless and 2.5% of the Sikh population killed by Muslims.   Ps- Im noticing stubborn Islamist still at their willful best to show Zealotry even in this thread by making all kind of excuses to exempt their **Religion of Peace™** from any kind of criticism about their **Peaceful acts** be it in past or today.  One thing for sure their Fanaticism is Admirable.   All one can say is to daily check the **World news** on Reddit and see how **Peaceful** Islam is globally  [**Latest** Nigeria: Muslims massacre up to 30 Christian students](http://times247.com/articles/nigeria-boko-haram-massacres-up-to-30-christian-students)  Lul I really don't expect much from Islamist's online, so i guess this post will also get modded down just like Salman Rushdie's Death Fatwa.",™

That will tell you if you are Pattern B and whether or not you need to worry.    Listen to lipidologist Thomas Dayspring talk about this: http://livinlavidalowcarb.com/blog/the-llvlc-show-episode-585-lipidologist-dr-thomas-dayspring-explains-the-truth-about-cholesterol   Peter Attia also [recommends](http://eatingacademy.com/nutrition/what-is-cholesterol) not wasting time with a VAP. Go right for the NMR:   &gt; NMR is the gold standard and more valuable than VAP. The reason is that only NMR can “count” the number of LDL particles which is actually what matters (rather than just the amount of cholesterol they hold). Cost is a function of insurance, typically.  Description of NMR from privateMDlabs.com (a service which appears to allow you to get a test ordered and completed without going through your doctor or insurance): &gt; The NMR LipoProfile® test uses NMR spectroscopy to measure the actual number of atherogenic LDL particles that build up in the arteries causing heart disease. By knowing how many of these particles are circulating in the blood, a physician can get a more accurate picture of a patient's heart health and, therefore make better patient care decisions. &gt;  &gt; Without the technology available through the NMR LipoProfile® test, Physicians merely estimate the number of particles by measuring the cholesterol they contain—known as LDL cholesterol (or LDL-C). Patients with a high number of LDL particles (LDL-P) are at increased risk for heart disease, even if they have ""normal"" LDL cholesterol levels.",®

t5_2tbbg,fairbianca,1349369848,"ita with the comments here about poking around a bit on here and also for sure about OCM - I also use oil to remove makeup and it is extremely effective as well as being good for your skin.  I use a different oil, but you can experiment around and find what works best for you.  I am personally suspicious about your scrub - honestly a mechanical exfoliant like that every day is probably quite a bit for your skin to handle (especially if you are using something with crushed seeds or *shudders* walnut hulls).  I would recommend a muslin cloth or a high quality face brush (Shiseido Cleansing Massage Brush is nice, and I ♥ my Clarisonic with the delicate head) with a moisturizing, soap-free cleanser such as Cetaphil Cleansing Lotion (my personal favorite is pricey but worth it - Carita Lagoon Water Gelee).  I would follow this with a lotion or emulsion (by lotion I mean a moisturizing water).  Again my personal favorite is pricey (Carita Lagoon Water Lotion) but you could also try rosewater mixed with a lightweight moisturizer (such as Cetaphil Moisturizing Lotion) so that it won't be too much on your skin.  I would also strongly recommend a sunscreen, but the kind that are the most effective (as well as cosmetically elegant) are going to be a bit more pricey.  You could try Shiseido SPF60+ Lotion (goes around $40 for a bottle but it lasts a long time), or if you want something even lighter weight (feels like you're seriously not wearing anything at all) go on ebay and find Biore UV Watery Essence SPF50.  It ends up being around the same as the Shiseido.  I'd say this would be a good minimum to have, and will hopefully keep your skin feeling calmer.  Hth, and good luck :)",♥

Yes, I agree that the book is more abstract and encompassing, but one of the governmental structures it quite blatantly calls out is Stalin's Russia. It essentially compares Stalin's Russia to fascism. This is not unknown territory to Orwell (see *Animal Farm*).   A while ago one of the mods basically called me out for saying that art should only matter as art in of itself. They argued against me saying art as intended by the artist is not nearly as significant as the context in which it is surrounded by and perceived.

The reason you drop spines is because once he has collosus, your zerglings are far less effective.  You can't drop minerals in a lot of roaches because almost all protoss mass immortal/sentry nowadays.  This leaves you with a ton of minerals, which you dump into drones/spines/queens.  I usually overdo the spines, which i reccomend you do in diamond to low masters.  Overdo is probably around 10+ by 14:30 and 20+ by 16:00.  about 13 at the main attack path (usually outside your 4th) and the other 7 by the less optimal attack path.  You need about 8 infestors to be support the spine wall.  Then you get a spire/hive, and get a GG of broodlords.  You're 2nd problem is before spine wall.  If he's doing a sentry/immortal all-in, you can scout this by seeing 4gas around 7minutes AND no 3rd at 9:30-10:00.

t5_2sdae,Nixflyn,1349418701,"They're really not going to let you double major, and you would never want to go in as undeclared for engineering.   Aerospace alone is not a 4 year degree, no matter what the schedule says. Some aeros do it in 5 years, most take 6. You just can't get all the classes you want. You will be limited to 13 units prior to week 1, when you can attempt to add into classes up to 16 units. However, I have not once been able to add a class, except for senior level classes that the department is forced to add you in. The curriculum assumes that you can get 18 units for most of your stay at Cal Poly, which isn't possible in most cases.  Also keep in mind that a LOT of classes in aerospace are ""labs™"". And by ""lab™"", I mean a 3 unit lecture with a large term project that they call a lab so they only have to give you 1 unit instead of 3. Now imagine you're taking 3 of these classes in your 13 unit load. You're doing the work of 19 units plus 3 term projects. Oh, and there are quite a few ARO classes that if you fail, you have to wait a year for the class to be offered again, and just about every class is a pre req for the next in the series. ARO is not a 4 year major.  But yeah, they won't let you double major in impacted programs (I actually think they don't let you double major at all). They'll also be dropping minors soon because of budget restraints.  Cal Poly is a special kind of hell, but it's because of this that we produce the best engineers around.",™

Make sure you write it out by hand.  ♦ When you’ve gotten absolutely everything off your mind and onto paper, put the letter aside.  ♦ Take a fresh sheet and write their response just the way you wish they would respond.

t5_2rske,PanTardovski,1349473083,"&gt; where are the fat-rich foods? they don't mention them, are they implying that protein-rich foods are also fat-rich foods?.  You're working from the (potentially) false premise that fat-rich foods would exhibit some unique behavior. Just by reading the abstract you can see they did separate analysis by macro (""Protein, fibre, and water contents of the test foods correlated positively with SI scores (r = 0.37, P &lt; 0.05, n = 38; r = 0.46, P &lt; 0.01; and r = 0.64, P &lt; 0.001; respectively) whereas fat content was negatively associated (r = -0.43, P &lt; 0.01).""), and if you're concerned you can take the values for individual foods and construct your own arbitrary groups from the data in Tables 2 and 4.  The point of the study is not that ""carbohydrates are the most and the less satiating food"" but rather that a number of factors affect satiety, not simply one or two macronutrients. Again, if you'd paid attention you'd notice that the authors conclude ""Protein, fibre, and water ... correlated positively with SI scores,"" i.e. not carbohydrate content but rather sheer bulk would account for the potato's high score.  &gt; Oh, and to worsen things, that study is sponsored by Kellogg's.  Yes, I've fallen for Kellogg's brilliant plan to trick me into buying potatoes. Those bastards. Kellogg's® potatoes and steak and fish. Indeed.",®

t5_2qh9k,JimMarch,1349483699,"No...see, the Dred Scott decision reviews a bunch of horrible racist laws from the colonial period and early US - including laws supported by various ""founding fathers"".  Seriously.  The worst they reference if I recall right is one from Massachusetts in the early US period that said that if a white and black married, the marriage was to be declared invalid *and any children were to be legally declared bastards*.    That and other racist laws were described in horrible detail.  So yeah, the ruling can be fairly characterized as:  ""Racist laws have always been a part of the US therefore racist laws are OK today.""  :(  The sad part is, the decision was legally correct but a moral travesty.  So because of Dred Scott, here's a law Alabama passed in 1865 (right after the Civil War ended:  ----------  1.  That it shall not be lawful for any freedman, mulatto, or free person of color in this State, to own fire-arms, or carry about his person a pistol or other deadly weapon.  2.  That after the 20th day of January, 1866, any person thus offending may be arrested upon the warrant of any acting justice of the peace, and upon conviction fined any sum not exceeding $100 or imprisoned in the county jail, or put to labor on the public works of any county, incorporated town, city, or village, for any term not exceeding three months.  3.  That if any gun, pistol or other deadly weapon be found in the possession of any freedman, mulatto or free person of color, the same may by any justice of the peace, sheriff, or constable be taken from such freedman, mulatto, or free person of color; and if such person is proved to be the owner thereof, the same shall, upon an order of any justice of the peace, be sold, and the proceeds thereof paid over to such freedman, mulatto, or person of color owning the same. [Ed. note: the off-duty fashion choices of “justices of the peace, sheriffs, or constables” at that time tended toward an ensemble of basic white bedsheets with eyeholes...especially at night.]  4.  That it shall not be lawful for any person to sell, give, or lend fire-arms or ammunition of any description whatever, to any freedman, free negro or mulatto; and any person so violating the provisions of this act shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction thereof, shall be fined in the sum of not less than fifty nor more than one hundred dollars, at the discretion of the jury trying the case.  - from “The Second Amendment: Towards An African-Americanist Reconsideration”, footnote 178 — two more state-level examples precede that one.  http://www.guncite.com/journals/cd-recon.html - *[© 1991 Georgetown Law Journal]*",©

t5_2s25d,JaneGael,1349529520,"As someone who has a dog with the worst level murmur and congestive heart failure because of it I don't think a vet is going to be able to produce any miracles for you.  If he was human he'd be in line for a transplant, but they don't do them for dogs.  His heart is enlarged, perhaps drastically so and the best you can do is to give medications that support the heart muscle and keep fluid drained from the body.  This can be heartbreakingly expensive.  My girl Cassie's vet/med and special food bills run between $800 - $900 a month.   If the vet hasn't told you be sure that he gets no salt except what is normally found in food and that you feed a lot of protein.  This will mean home cooking as much as possible and you will need to do some research on what is the best kibble to feed as some are quite high in sodium.

Their success was such that Star Wars™ is now embedded in popular culture and our collective memory. The exhibition, designed by the H5 collective, features a selection of four hundred toys and spin-off products generated by the films, all from the unique French collection amassed by ScienceFictionArchives.com. Most of the objects come from the first trilogy, Star Wars™ (1977), The Empire Strikes Back™ (1980) and Return of the Jedi™ (1983). Today’s children will discover the toys their parents once played with, and also those produced by Hasbro for the prequels, The Phantom Menace™, Attack of the Clones™ and Revenge of the Sith™, including the 2012 range. Many of these articulated figures, dolls, outfits, masks, spacecraft, soft toys, illustrations and video games also show the stages of their production from prototype to the final product, revealing fabrication secrets of some of the most popular toys of all time. Star Wars was also a turning point in graphic design linked to Heroic Fantasy and science fiction. For the public at the time, the original poster for Star Wars was an iconic image opening up a completely new imaginary world. This exhibition reveals the full scope of this extraordinary legacy passed down from generation to generation for thirty- five years.***",™

t5_2qore,solargatorade,1349589565,"It's a bug that was deemed harmless and even cool enough to present as a feature. The way it works is that when an avenger mob dies the avenger affix checks for elite flagged mobs to apply the boost to. It was designed with the intend to not boost other white mobs in the area but they didn't anticipate the need to make it pack-specific. This is pretty clear when compared to other pack-specific affixes like fire chains or health link, these are properly coded and do not affect elite mobs from other packs.  Invincible jumping lacunis (I guess this was edited later?) are also a bug. This is due to Diablo's 2.5D inner workings. What happens is that when the lacunis jump, the actor is momentarily above the game's 2D object tracking grid and therefore it does not exist as far as your character is concerned.   More info: Diablo 3 is played on a plane; the plane itself can be kinked or curved but all the action takes place on a two dimensional planar coordinate grid. This is also evident in the way some displacement skills like leap and teleport work; leap takes you off the plane, teleport only moves you in a straight line on the plane.  Lastly the feature best described as ""server lag"". Attacks damaging you even when they miss, and melee attacks hitting you from a screen away if you move fast enough. This is laughable. It is an intended game feature as much as BP is all about the environment - if you believe the official word.   There is no behind-the-code tech analysis here; it is the good old fashioned lag that we know and hate and it is present throughout the game: just think of all the times you have died even though you clicked on your potion or defensive skill in time. All the times that you leaped or tumbled out of melee only to land dead a few Diablo yards™ (another 'bug feature' that can easily be corrected in minutes!) nearby.   The official excuse is that if they didn't do that, everyone could just walk harmlessly past monsters and that would ruin the game - which is of course complete BS. Just think of every other similar game that tracks attacks properly, from TL2 that is already out and works just as perfectly as your sound card, all the way back to Diablo 2 and animation frame breakpoints. Were these games ruined by the lack of artificial lag? I don't believe they were.  The cold hard truth is that you cannot make a millisecond-critical fast paced action game entirely server-based if your servers aren't up for it. They can never say that they chose to build Diablo 3 around monetization first and gameplay second, so the next best excuse is to present single-player lag as a feature (*some* latency is always expected at online, server-based multiplayer but even there D3 is currently one of the worst).  The Diablo team has done an incredible U-turn in terms of community support and open-ness since the launch of the game, and we have indeed seen some amazing fixes, improvements, and dozens of issues dealt with. But they are still a huge business; PR and putting a positive spin on everything are paramount. When fixing errors is simply out of the question because of time vs profit, there is no choice but to lie their ass off and bet that people know little enough to believe them. I am not bashing Blizzard here; just pointing out that almost every big business is forced to do this and we should be keeping this in mind when issues like ""horrible bug working as intended"" are discussed.",™

t5_2upx6,starrynightgirl,1349633221,"Yes there are a bunch of different methods for curling your lashes. In makeup school I learned to pinch once at the base, walk it out halfway and pinch again, then again a quarter way out. Believe me I’ve tried them all… have even tried spoons and heated curlers. And I’m sure you have your own techniques too (do share!). But today I am simply sharing this one because it is a game changer. Hear my voice in your head, sister: if you only pinch with the curler upright, you’re only doing it halfway! You have to then also pinch with the curler inverted. Trust me on this. It’s one of the biggest secrets I can share.  You’ll need:  A lash curler obviously! This one from MAC is my personal favorite (M·A·C 'Carine Roitfeld' Full Lash Curler) as it gives the strongest pinch or try my favorite more budget-friendly choice (Target Sonia Kashuk® Dramatically Defining Eye Lash Curler ).  Steps:  1. Insert your lashes into the opened curler and line it up right at your lashline, but not too close that you pinch the skin.  2. Pinch at the lashline; mostly to grab hold, not to make a crimp.  3. With that holding, rotate your wrist so that your thumb stays mostly in the same place and acts as the pivot point while your pinkie finger goes from being around your chin area all the way up towards your forehead.  4. Now that the curler is inverted, give your lashes a proper upside-down pinch for about 5 seconds. Really squeeze it as tightly as you can (without pulling of course).  5. Rotate your hand back to the starting position and carefully open the curler then slide it away from your lashes.  6. The most important step: tweet us before and after pictures! Or tag them #thebeautydepartment on Instagram!  7. Then you add a coat of mascara and bat your lashes at all the cuties out there. ",®

Think back to how long it took even the smallest thing( Reaper insanity, for instance ) to get changed.  It took until allllll the way up until the Bunker ""Nerf"" ( Where salvage now costs Terrans a small amount of money. ) to try to stem the flow of Bunker-Rushes, wall-ins, and all-ins.   You DO get to voice your opinion as a Terran---We all hear it. It's on here every day from some Terran, just like it used to be from some random Zerg. Just like back then, ""The Whiners"" were downvoted.   It's not as one-sided as you're trying to make it out to be---It just feels worse because you're finally on the receiving end of it.   ( In the words of the infinite Terrans back then: ""Practice harder. [Insert player here ( Taeja )] is still winning, so why aren't you?"" )   'As far as fixing WOL is concerned---They are focused on HOTS with good reason: It's their new product and the majority of people will be persuing it.  Most people, including the professional scene, will be moving over to HOTS when it is released. The easiest thing for them to currently do is try to balance HOTS then apply their changes to ""old units"" to WOL. There's literally no reason to balance WOL, then try to work out balancing HOTS, then just have to change WOL again because the new units ""mess things up"".  What suggestion would you make to fixing TvP using Seige Tanks? I do not think people think very far ahead when it comes to balance on here. We just cry out that we want something changed and don't really offer a valid solution. What would you want done to them? Range changed? You can't really do that, because now you're messing with the TvT and ZvT metagame to extreme extents with no new units to even TRY to open up space to fix the issues.   These new units are proving to fix a lot of problems that the races are complaining about. Zergs now have an option that doesn't involve HAVING to go Broodlords just to try and crack and opponent's base open. ( Something the other two races have had. ) Protoss is getting the world's best ""Swiss Army Knife"" of a unit in the Mothership Core. It's not only defensive now, but absurdly offensive. It saves your army in a pinch, making base-trades near impossible. Terrans finally have another AOE unit in the Widow Mine----Of which I am SURE you can see every player on the planet complaining about, because of how balls-insane it is currently ( Which I expect some kind of change to. ). The Battle-Hellion also fills the role that seemed necessary to make Mech in TvP viable. Chargelots were a large problem for Terrans going mech and the Battle Hellion fixes this.   I'm sorry, but you're just feeling ""butt hurt"" like Zergs were in seasons 1 through 3.

I am glad there were so many sensible posts along with the denial posts.   LSD is very powerful, for good or worse. You can reduce your risks of bad trips very effectively by knowing good from bad settings but The Fear™ can still happen in normally rational healthy minds.   I had a nightmare of a trip on strong LSD as a teenager. Lesson learned about bad settings. It never happened again but I will never forget that terror and the immense strength I had in that state of mind. Some people kept insisting I had taken PCP and I know damn well that I did not.   Likewise I have taken PCP (sherms) a few times and neither me nor my friends acted aggressively.

The only difference is the refinement of their plans and the fact we can access a tremendous amount of information globally in the blink of an eye and thus coverage of events/news is immense.

t5_2r6f3,btcprox,1349702655,"Combinations Rule = the order of choosing from a set of elements doesn't matter, Permutations Rule = the order DOES matter. {a,b,c}, {b,a,c}, {c,a,b}, {c,b,a}, {b,c,a} and {a,c,b} are all different permutations, but are the same combination of the letters a, b and c.  Partitions Rule: If an event can be further declassified into 2 or more *disjoint* sub-events, the probability of this event happening = the sum of the individual probabilities of the sub-events. For instance, the event ""Bob is in school right now"" can be declassified into a few sub-events: Bob is in the canteen right now, Bob is in the library right now, Bob is in the lecture theatre right now, etc. Note that these sub-events are disjoint because he can't be in 2 places within the school at the same time. So P(Bob is in school right now) = P(Bob is in the canteen right now) + P(Bob is in the library right now) + P(Bob is in the lecture theatre right now) and so on.  Multiplicative Rule: If an event can be split into 2 or more *successive* sub-events, the probability of the event occurring = the product of the probabilities of the sub-events. E.g. when flipping a coin, P(flipping 2 heads in a row) = P(flipping heads the first time) \* P(flipping heads the second time). Note that this coin-flipping example involves *mutually exclusive* sub-events, i.e. whether you get heads the first time will not alter the probability of getting a second heads.   In the case of sub-events that are NOT mutually exclusive, extra care must be taken in calculating the probabilities. For instance, taking a standard poker card deck, P(drawing A♠ followed by Q♠) = P(drawing A♠ from the 52 cards) \* P(drawing Q♠ *from the remaining 51 cards*). Note that drawing the A♠ leaves 51 cards in the deck, which affects the probability of drawing the Q♠ next!",♠

My thoughts and feelings about gaming house. feel free to copy to reddit whoeverz first h4h4h4  Obviously moving in cant possibly have much harm for improving our team. The main benefits of me moving in are (Learned from 6 months of gaming house in Korea): 1) I get to help reduce down time of mostly 3 people always being late/mia (Despite their all right there in the same house) and delaying scrims for up to hours (In the past gaming houses if i don't wake and tell people to get their asses on their pcs repeated to get ready for the scrim/join lobby... they literally, will not l0l). 2) When arguments get escalated and blow up (Which they really shouldn't ever... but some people are quite teh extra emotional). I always do a decent job of making the arguments start going back in the right efficient direction l0l. 3) Can watch the same replay together. I think this is the only 'real' benefit. But its not like i don't watch every scrim's replay at home and reflect with the team the same.  What i felt from Korea gaming housing is that with our personalities the gaming house is really good for encouraging some people to actually sit down and play the game more and also not just want to always rush thru all the scrims i set up daily for us. I actually also want to add that for some that have super sensitive emotions and often times needing to escalate arguments... gaming houses is actually bad for this l0l0l.  As for the out-of-the-game aspects... I actually really enjoy running my own house, and i feel like it makes me feel better (in da brainz) and more fresh &amp; full as a human being l0l.

Even tho hotshot is the creator of clg, i can safely say i care about clg and it's success more than or just as much as him/anyone else on the team (If hotshot was asked about this im sure he would probably even agree l0L). Hotshot/chauster/myself may not all do equal amount of stuff visible to the public, but we wish for and want clg to succeed more than anything in the world (chausters/hs way too lazy tho, but that is who they are). Peepz probably say i do extra stuff for clg because i feel guilty for not being there in the house, somewhat true? but doesn't really matter where i amz. i like doing work so i don't feel like a lazy piece of poop and when asked by someone 'what did u accomplish today i have lots of shit things to share' (sadly not everyone in the world can has the same idea th0 h4h4).  Most of you will say~ i say all this shit just cause i wanna live with Kelly (they are shit but their very true and correct shit! l0l) . This plays a pretty big part in the decision but the other things i mentioned above are really the base of the decision. In the end you could say clg felt like the small minor benefits could be sacrificed only because of what kind of a person i am and how much i care about clg.

These would primarily be: &gt; &gt;    * Get off the car/road addiction and move to mass transit en-masse (eliminate all road and gas subsidies entirely at all levels of government) &gt; &gt;    * Urbanize-and-de-Suburbanize en-masse (again eliminate all government supports that perpetuate the inefficiency - only dense urban cities scale energy consumption, healthcare, etc., well and US problems are largely resource + scaling problems) &gt; &gt;    * Focus everything to being human-scaled rather than institution/corporate-scaled (American cities suck compared to  Asian/European cities because urban ""design"" is never done human-scaled and it is micromanaged thus)  I make a living designing roadways in California. I often tell people how much I support light-rail, high-speed-rail, bus rapid transit, and toll roads (a lot). Most think I'm crazy. They don't understand that there is a finite capacity to an efficient road network. They don't understand how their work commute affects the prices of transported goods. They don't understand how much more it costs to maintain a linear foot of a lane of a roadway compared to a train track. Finally, they don't understand how *crappy* the suburbs really are for everything except the massive California Living Box™.  It is absolutely time for California to go vertical. Our major cities are an absolute joke in population density.

t5_2cneq,Minifig81,1349732322,"The fourth president of the United States, James Madison, was much like the other Virginia presidents--Washington and Jefferson--who went before him. Like them, he loved his home state only a little less than his country. Like them, he was a rich man who gave his whole life to public service. He was an able student of politics and government who brought real knowledge and skill to his job. In public office Madison was a calm, reasoning statesman who governed by force of logic. In a time when emotions ran high, he made common sense prevail. He was not always successful in dealing with foreign nations, but history has shown that he had right and justice on his side. He entered the presidency at a time when war clouds hung over the young nation. He saw his country through the disastrous War of 1812, and his final months in office produced the ""era of good feeling"" that lasted for many years. He did well as secretary of state and as president, but his greatest record was made earlier. For his outstanding work on the nation's charter, Madison is known as the Father of the Constitution.    ""It may not be easy, in every possible case, to trace the line of separation between the rights of religion and the Civil authority with such distinctness as to avoid collisions and doubts on unessential points.  The tendency to unsurpastion on one side or the other, or to a corrupting coalition or alliance between them, will be best guarded agst. by an entire abstinence of the Gov't from interfence in any way whatsoever, beyond the necessity of preserving public order, and protecting each sect agst. trespasses on its legal rights by others.""

In some instances they have been seen to erect a spiritual tyranny on the ruins of the civil authority; on many instances they have been seen upholding the thrones of political tyranny; in no instance have they been the guardians of the liberties of the people.  Rulers who wish to subvert the public liberty may have found an established clergy convenient auxiliaries.  A just government, instituted to secure and perpetuate it, needs them not.""         - ""A Memorial and Remonstrance"", 1785     ""Experience witnesseth that ecclesiastical establishments, instead of maintaining the purity and efficacy of religion, have had a contrary operation.

More or less, in all places, pride and indolence in the clergy; ignorance and servility in the laity; in both, superstition, bigotry and persecution.""    - Ibid, 1785    ""Religious bondage shackles and debilitates the mind and unfits it for every noble enterprise.""       -letter to Wm.

t5_2qixm,kraetos,1349739900,"This episode occurs at a very interesting place in Star Trek history. Episode 85 overall, episode 12 of season 4, in January, 1991.  You see, it's about 5 episodes after ""Legacy,"" a relatively straightforward and predictable commentary on gang warfare that was more meaningful in 1990 than it is today. But ""Legacy"" isn't very interesting because of it's content; instead, it is interesting because of what it meant for the franchise as a whole. You see, Legacy was TNG's 80th episode—meaning that as of that episode, TNG had officially ran longer than TOS.  Kind of weird to think about today, with 5 series spanning over 700 episodes and nearly 250 years of future history under *Trek's* belt, not to mention 11 movies and a new one coming out in mere months, but back then, this was a Big Deal™. No one really thought TNG would go anywhere. It was syndicated, and it was a revival of a show that had been off the air for 18 years. And to top it off, it was sci-fi, and people were a little worn out on sci fi after Star Wars fever had passed.  But somehow, TNG endured. After a rocky first season, two members of the main cast bailing out, and a writers strike, TNG was back for season 2. And then something happened—TNG started to get good. Real good. First with ""A Measure of a Man,"" and then with ""Q Who."" So it came back for a third season, and it got even better! Episodes like ""Yesterday's Enterprise"" and ""Sins of the Father"" cemented TNG as a dramatic heavyweight that was now living up to it's lofty reputation.  And then, seemingly out of nowhere, we got ""The Best of Both Worlds,"" two of the best hours of television ever produced, regardless of genre.  That's the thing about 1991: it was an *amazing* year for Star Trek. We got ""The Wounded,"" but we also got ""The Drumhead,"" ""Redemption I &amp; II,"" ""Darmok,"" ""Unification I &amp; II,"" and last but definitely not least ""Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country."" They *really* knocked it out of the park that year, as if Berman, Braga, Moore and Meyers wanted to give Gene a fitting sendoff. Trek wont have another year this jaw-droppingly awesome until 1997, but I would argue that 1991 is far and away the best year of *Trek.*  So for me, ""The Wounded"" really represents where the modern era of Trek took off. Until now, Star Trek was really living in TOS's shadow. But now, TNG was experimenting with new ideas and was drawing more viewers for each new episode than TOS ever did. And to capstone this year of greatness from TNG, we get the TOS swan song, which is arguably the best *Star Trek* movie period, and most will agree it's definitely top 3.  The fact that ""The Wounded"" is the introduction of the Cardassians really drives this home. The Cardassians were not a part of TOS in any way, shape or form, but they go on to appear more than the Romulans do, the first real recurring villain that TOS introduced. To me, it represents the point where TNG's influence on the Star Trek universe began to surpass TOS's, and that's a big deal.",™

Considering there are several technical things being covered here, I thought I might go more with the organic questions:   Do you three feel that a certain time of day or even certain time of year resonates more with your creative flow? And as such, are there any rituals you tend to favor (ie foods, routines, sugars, inspirational music).  Would any of you say you get influence on the stories/edm productions you are telling from 'mystical/spiritual' sources. I ask because of the video for We can make the world stop and its hints at evolving powers of the mind...and also because you guys use sacred geometry pretty heavily in your artwork...not to mention, the manner you use in all of your perspectives is heavily in line with egoless mysticism that I have studied (and of course, the obvious title...starve the ego, feed the soul.) My apologies again if this is too personal, or deleteworthy.    Do you like to regiment your time in any scheduled way to allow relaxation and inspiration? (Do you guys tend to rotate tracks once you get too saturated with them or used to hearing them, and does anyone get days off while others are working or is it more of a work as you feel environment).   Collab is hard--cheers to you guys for finding what I personally feel to be one of the best possible musical chemistries on earth. ♥ Keep up the good work and know that I fully support your openness with the upcoming album! Much love and appreciation... It is my biggest musical anticipation aside from the hopeful tool album :) ",♥

t5_2qh1i,IronMew,1349783909,"I worded my reply poorly; I didn't mean that YOU don't have any brain, I meant that I doubt the mental capacity of anyone who suddenly goes ""OMG we're being lied to!!!11!"" as if it's something that only started happening in the last five years. I did not put you in that category.  The political system is broken to such a degree that anyone who gets into a position of relevant power should on no accounts be allowed to do the job. And anyone who has the potential to threaten the system is not allowed to achieve power, and therefore remains weak and unable to change anything.  The only way to change this would be to fake conformist positions until you're in power, then reveal your true intentions and renege all the promises you've made to the greedy bastards who enabled your rise. I imagine this would make you loved by the common people, but the EvilCorp® of the moment would probably soon be looking at the ""hitmen"" category on LinkedIn.  As for the military thing: I understand all your wants, and since you do seem to have a brain I'd be surprised if they were any different, but wanting things doesn't magically make them happen. As you say, it makes very little difference who you vote for nowadays; either is just as likely to send you protecting your country's ~~oil interests~~ freedom and democracy in deity-forsaken places whose leaders would prefer all the modern civilized world to just up and die.  If the political system made it possible to **actually** bring sanity to those places (who, let's face it, are in dire need of it), then I'd applaud you for a courageous choice; but as this is not the case, and since wherever you go you're very likely to just incite further hatred and tyranny from unhinged extremist groups and possibly from the very people you're hoping to protect, I don't really know how you hope being in the military is going to restore hope in humanity.  Or to put it in other words: I don't doubt that your intentions are good, but you're serving people who will make sure you're part of the problem rather than the solution.  Notice that I don't expect this to suddenly change your opinions and life choices, I'm just clarifying my point so you don't think I'm just pointing a finger at you and shouting ""HA-HA!"" like Nelson.

t5_2qhx4,gligoran,1349801971,"In tiny writing: The American Heritage® Dictionary of the English Language... Apparently only American English knows this as a pound sign.  This is the story behind it (source Wikipedia): &gt;Historically, the pound name derives from a series of abbreviations for pound, the unit of weight. At first ""lb."" was used; however, printers later designed a font containing a special symbol of an ""lb"" with a line through the verticals so that the lowercase letter ""l"" would not be mistaken for the numeral ""1"". Unicode character U+2114 ℔ l b bar symbol (HTML: &amp;#8468;) is a cursive development of this symbol. Ultimately, the symbol was reduced for clarity as an overlay of two horizontal strokes ""="" across two forward-slash-like strokes ""//"".[1] Keith Gordon Irwin, in The Romance of Writing, p. 125, says ""The Italian libbra (from the old Latin word libra, 'balance') represented a weight almost exactly equal to the avoirdupois pound of England. The Italian abbreviation of lb with a line drawn across the letters [℔] was used for both weights. The business clerks' hurried way of writing the abbreviation appears to have been responsible for the # sign used for pound.""",®

t5_2qmeb,MrPattywagon,1349805221,"PETA doesn't think Pokemon is evil.  &gt;PokÃ©mon deserves praise for promoting good care and affection for other living beings–even imaginary ones. However, real animals in the real world shouldn’t be confined to small spaces against their will–whether it’s a Poke Ball or a cage for egg-laying hens. The world of PokÃ©mon is clearly fictional, and we trust that most kids can see this distinction. However, parents may want to ensure that their children understand that while cartoon animals living in imaginary Poke Balls is all in good fun, real animals should always be treated with compassion and respect and should never be condemned to life in a cage. -PETA’s official response when asked their stance on PokÃ©mon.  This might seem confusing, but it's because people are misunderstanding the medium of the message for the message itself.  PETA wants to send a message to people who play their parody that the amount of emotion and protectiveness they have for Pokemon in a fictional game might be appropriate for animals in the real world. They obviously grossly misrepresented how the Pokemon world actually works - but the intent isn't to lambast or criticize Pokemon as evil. The idea is to deliver a message about animal cruelty and animal suffering/well-being *in our world* in a way that people can easily access and understand, though fiction. And by ""people"" I mean kids.  It also creates media hype because I'm sure PETA could predict that this parody would create a lot of anger.  In any case, don't confuse the medium of the message for the message itself and you'll understand what PETA is trying to do.",©

I have one general behavior to throw at you that might give you a place to start answering that question.  For a very long time, we have been instructed in the idea that persecution creates cohesion. Look at the way the radical religious right is constantly drumming the idea of attacks on Christians in America when they are still the extremely dominant group. By making them believe that they are under attack and being persecuted the leadership generates a unified group willing to follow orders.   You even see this in Wicca. How often do you still hear about the nonsense ""Burning Times"" where ""Millions and Millions of Witches™"" were unjustly slaughtered left and right by those ""Evil Christians℠"" and the Inquisition (which no one expected)?  I have found that many people, especially those who are having to go through a recovery period after leaving the religion of their birth (Christianity of some form or another for most of us), feel a great deal of resentment towards that religion for insults and abuses, actual and perceived. I know it took me a long time to turn the page on that chapter of my life. I spent a long time writing in the margins of the end of that chapter before I finally decided that Christian theology and behavior didn't really matter to me except when they try to shove their beliefs down my throat. All the things in the past are just that, the past. They lay the foundation for things but I choose what to build on that foundation.  I hope that makes sense and helps.",™

t5_2ranw,centurijon,1349831164,"&gt;I've learned that his sister and mother were suffering from some psychological disorders, and that he was relied on by them to be there for them when they needed it.  I was so supportive my ex-wife through 12 years of self-doubt, near-depression, anxiety, and indecisiveness that I lost who I was. I had (inadvertently) cut so much out of my life to help keep her afloat that I am a wildly different person than who I used to be. Near the end I even had to force myself to be numb so that her issues wouldn't crush me. I literally had no room for myself in my own head. It's the major reason behind why I got a divorce.  Just thought I'd shed a little light from my own experience there.  #Fun story time:  * Me: Finalizing a divorce * Her: Getting out of an abusive relationship  Met her through a friend. Drunken hookup. Hooked up again the next day, felt *something™*. She goes on vaca, comes back a week later, *something™* has not died down at all.  Great, right? We go on a date. Best date ever - for on both sides. Find out we have tons in common, our personalities match, our outlook on life matches, and our goals align. The next 5 weeks are spent talking every day and seeing each other almost every day. Every night it's ""I like you a lot"" and ""I can't believe how quickly two people can become so close"". Something™ evolves into a real connection. I swear one night she stopped herself in the middle of saying ""I love you"" and I almost said it back. That's incredible for me in such a short time.  In early September she says ""we shouldn't see each other anymore"". Wait, what?! Literally 12 hours before she had said that she really liked me! There are several reasons, a small one being that my divorce isn't quite finalized yet (waiting on the court), several much larger ones related to the trauma of her coming out of an abusive relationship.  But I was absolutely destroyed by this. This was the first girl to ever really find her way through my armor, the first girl to ever really get under my skin (in a good way), the first girl that I've felt this connection with. Nobody has ever gotten so deep so quickly.  In my head I know that, because of the other things in our lives, cutting things off was the right thing *at this point in time*, but I really wish I could stop thinking about her.  &gt;I just feel so... ~~scared~~confused. And bitter. I want to see him so badly this weekend, I want to have fun and make things feel right again with him like we had on our visits before, and I feel like this guy is losing his faith in me [...]. I feel like if he gets to see me again, is reminded of what we have, things will be alright. It's just a hard time for both of us and we just need to tough it out. I haven't changed, I'm still the girl who pulled up next to him in his backyard, I just think he's under so much stress and doesn't know how to handle some things. [...] I don't want things like that to make me leave him, I want to stay. I didn't fall asleep until 2:30 in the morning just thinking, going through a range of emotions to sadness and ~~anger~~disbelief and hope and complete indifference. What I hate most is that I know he'll make up his mind and want to leave, all the while I'm sitting here wanting so badly for things to work.  You are me, in girl form.",™

t5_2qhlm,upton-ogood,1349889946,"&gt;[W]hen [tests] become a thing evaluated without respect to if they are consistent with anything else they become silly.  I'd just like, if I could, to underscore and amplify this particular point. I've posted [this article](http://epaa.asu.edu/ojs/article/view/1096/982) elsewhere on this thread, and it's definitely worth a read. I honestly wish more people would read the critical research that's being done on this sort of nonsense and shout the findings from the rooftops. Here are some excerpts regarding the findings of the authors' study [emphasis added]:  **Reliability**  According its developers, SAS® EVAAS® is meant to “assess and predict student performance with precision and reliability” and it is “the most robust and reliable” value-added system available, more than the “other simplistic models found in the market today” (SAS, 2011). In terms of the data presented here, however, it is clear that inconsistencies were a consistent problem. Across the four cases, issues with reliability were evident. Such issues with reliability are also well documented in the literature (Au, 2010; Baeder, 2010; Baker et al, 2010; CCSSO, 2010; Haertel, 2011; Koedel &amp; Betts, 2007; Papay, 2010, Shaw &amp; Bovaird, 2011; Schochet &amp; Chiang, 2010).   Yet these four teachers were removed from their teaching positions “at least in part” due to SAS® EVAAS® data that in three of the four cases researchers evidenced as unreliable (see Tables 1-4). **The probability that three of the four teachers added or detracted value from year-to-year was roughly the same as the flip of a coin. This is pragmatically, methodologically, conceptually, and morally concerning.** In addition, as researchers suggest that at least three years of value-added data are needed to make such judgments (Brophy, 1973; Cody et al., 2010; Harris, 2011), and even then with a 25% risk of misclassification (Au, 2010; CCSSO, 2010; Otterman, 2010; Schochet &amp; Chiang, 2010; Shaw &amp; Bovaird, 2011), this is also troublesome. Not one of the four teachers had three years of consistent data (that were detectibly different from other similar teachers) to warrant nonrenewal. Other HISD teachers whom researchers interviewed (Collins, in progress) noted concerns about this as well, again comparing the receipt of merit monies based on SAS® EVAAS® data to “winning the lottery.” One eighth grade advanced English teacher noted:   &gt;I do what I do every year. I teach the way I teach every year. [My] first year got me pats on the back. [My] second year got me kicked in the backside. And for year three my scores were off the charts. I got a huge bonus, and now I am in the top quartile of all the English teachers. **What did I do differently? I have no clue.**  A 7th grade history teacher classified her past three years as “bonus, bonus, disaster.” A social studies teacher added:   &gt;We had an 8th grade teacher, a very good teacher, the “real science guy,” [who was a] very good teacher…[but] every year he showed low [SAS®] EVAAS® growth. My principal flipped him with the 6th grade science teacher who was getting the highest [SAS®] EVAAS® scores on campus. Huge [SAS®] EVAAS® scores. [And] now the 6th grade teacher [is showing] no growth [as an 8th grade teacher], but the 8th grade teacher who was sent down [to the 6th grade] is getting the biggest bonuses on campus.   SAS® EVAAS® developers claim they have evidence that teachers who move from one environment to another, even if radically different, continue to do as well and are classified the same in SAS® EVAAS® terms over time (LeClaire, 2011). Evidence presented herein should yield caution regarding this assertion.  **Bias**  Teachers credited such “chaos” to the different students they taught and the different classroom contexts in which they taught year-to-year. For example, **while Teacher C’s SAS® EVAAS® data illustrated that Teacher C consistently detracted value from her students’ learning, and did so across subject areas, this was likely because Teacher C taught some of the highest-need students, possibly across the district.**  In addition, HISD teachers note that those teaching inordinate numbers of special education students in mainstreamed classrooms are least likely to add value (Collins, in progress). Teachers teaching the same students over consecutive years (e.g., looping) report receiving bonuses for the first year and nothing the next as they are “maxing out” on growth, and actually “competing with themselves.” **Teachers agree that it is best for them “to get average kids, yes, because the regular kids, you can grow those kids!”**  Teachers teaching gifted students report finding it very difficult to add value and get merit pay as a result (Collins, in progress; see also Wright, Horn, &amp; Sanders, 1997). They report being able to “only get them up so much!” One teacher working with gifted students noted:   &gt;Every year I have the highest test scores, [and] I have fellow teachers that [sic] come up to me when they get their bonuses…One recently came up to me [and] literally cried, ‘I’m so sorry.’… I’m like, ‘Don’t be sorry…It’s not your fault.’ Here I am…with the highest test scores and I’m getting $0 in bonuses. It makes no sense year-to-year how this works…. How do I, how do I, you know, I don’t know what to do. **I don’t know how to get higher than a 100%.**  Another 5th grade teacher working with gifted students explained:  &gt;I have students [in a 5th grade gifted reading class] who score at the 6th, 7th, &amp; 8th grade levels in reading. **But I’m like please babies, score at the 9th grade level, cause if you don’t score at the 9th or 10th grade or higher in 5th grade with me, I’m going to show negative growth.** Even though you, you’re gifted, and you’re talented, and you’re high! I can only push you so much higher when you are already so high. I’m scared.  Teachers teaching in grades in which ELLs were transitioned into mainstreamed English only classrooms also report being the least likely to add value. One 4th grade teacher noted:  &gt;I went to a transition classroom, and now there’s a red flag next to my name. I guess now I’m an ineffective teacher? I keep getting letters from the district, saying ‘You’ve been recognized as an outstanding teacher’…this, this, and that. But now because I teach English Language Learners who ‘transition in,’ my scores drop? And I get a flag next to my name for not teaching them well?  A 5th grade teacher added:  &gt;I’m scared to teach in the 4th grade. **I’m scared I might lose my job if I teach in a[n] [ELL] transition grade level, because I’m scared my scores are going to drop, and I’m going to get fired because there’s probably going to be no growth.**  Another 4th/5th grade teacher explained, **“When they say nobody wants to do 4th grade – nobody wants to do 4th grade! Nobody”** (Collins, in progress). This was evidenced in the data collected for Teacher D as well who, like Teacher A, switched back and forth across subject areas until her last year during which she purportedly detracted value across subject areas. This was the year her supervisor assigned her to teach an ELL transition year, during which an inordinate number of ELLs entered her classroom.  **Until SAS® EVAAS® developers can evidence that teachers teaching inordinate numbers of ELLs particularly in transition years, and teachers teaching special education or gifted students are not disparately impacted by the non-random placement of these students into their classrooms (Monk, 1987; Rothstein, 2009), terminating teachers on these grounds is remiss and morally indefensible.** Just recently, both SAS® EVAAS® and HISD’s Chief Human Resources Officer acknowledged via email that ceiling effects adversely impacted some teachers working with gifted students in their capacities to demonstrate value-added (A. Best, personal communication, January 21, 2012).  On the contrary, SAS® EVAAS® developers continue to claim that student background factors do not impact students’ ability to grow year-to-year in the SAS® EVAAS® model, mainly because the system uses students’ previous years of data as “blocking factors” to prevent such variables from biasing or distorting growth (Sanders &amp; Horn, 1994, 1998; Sanders et al., 2009; Wright, White, Sanders, &amp; Rivers, 2010). As evidenced here, these claims might not be entirely true. Appropriately, this is also one of SAS® EVAAS® developer’s most highly contested claims (AmreinBeardsley, 2008; Ballou, Sanders, &amp; Wright, 2004; Braun, 2005; Cody et al., 2010; Kuppermintz, 2003; McCaffrey et al., 2003; McCaffrey, Lockwood, Koretz, Louis, &amp; Hamilton, 2004b; Sanders &amp; Wright, 2008; Sanders et al., 2009; Tekwe, Carter, Ma, Algina, Lucas, Roth et al., 2004).",®

t5_2qhlm,upton-ogood,1349890070,"**Teacher Attribution**  The aforementioned lack of reliability could also be due to other context-related issues that further complicate the calculation of a teacher’s value-added. Teacher B, for example, whose SAS® EVAAS® scores were negative for two years and positive for the most recent year for which she had data, taught for the same years alongside a math enrichment teacher who taught almost half of her students at the same time and an equal amount of time per week. Teacher A was not a teacher of record for approximately 50% of her students one of the years for which she was held accountable using the SAS® EVAAS® because she was moved from teaching the third to the fourth grade midyear. Another HISD teacher taught alongside a reading specialist four days per week, and then posted the most growth and received the largest bonus she ever had (Collins, in progress). It is uncertain whether the reading specialist received a bonus for her apparent contributions as well.   **Nonetheless, these instances raise concerns about the percentage of value teachers under this system add to, or detract from their students’ learning and achievement and whether they can be held responsible for 100% of their students’ scores. These issues might also play into why such inconsistencies are evident. Determining what percent of value-added scores can be attributed to teachers is very difficult, if even possible** (Campbell &amp; Stanley, 1963; Corcoran, 2010; Ishii, &amp; Rivkin, 2009; Kane &amp; Staiger, 2008; Kennedy, 2010; Linn, 2008; Nelson, 2011; Papay, 2010; Rothstein, 2009).  SAS® EVAAS® developers claim, though, that through a linking verification process (during which teachers mark for what percent of each student’s instruction (s)he should be held accountable) they can partition out different teachers’ value-added effects (Derringer, 2010; Sanders &amp; Horn, 1994). However, **there is no empirical evidence suggesting that numerically splitting or dividing teacher effects accurately accounts for a teacher’s contribution.** In addition, not only is such a practice counterintuitive, but breaking up effort across teachers using percentages and proportions is nonsensical given the interaction effects that occur among and between students and teachers (Monk, 1987). Teachers are situated in complex and collaborative learning environments. **It is highly unlikely their value-added effects can be fractionalized using simple or even complex mathematics and statistics.**  **Criterion-Related Evidence of Validity**  One way to generate criterion-related evidence of validity is to assess whether teachers who demonstrate added value are also the teachers deemed effective through other, independent measures of teacher quality concurrently or at the same time (see also McCaffrey, Lockwood, Koretz, Louis, &amp; Hamilton, 2004a). In this instance, researchers examined whether the four nonrenewed teachers also seemed to be ineffectual given their PDAS scores, specifically to determine if these teachers’ supervisors also observed that these teachers were inadequate.   Analyzing the four teachers’ SAS® EVAAS® scores over time alongside their PDAS scores, researchers found statistical signals indicating that both of these measures were not measuring the teaching effectiveness construct accurately and consistently across teachers. The better Teacher A did on the SAS® EVAAS® the worse she did in the eyes of her supervisor(s) (r = -0.51, r = -0.83, r = -0.11). Yet for Teacher B, the better she did on the SAS® EVAAS® the better she did on the PDAS (r = 0.91). This yields the type of correlation coefficient we would expect to see if in fact both indicators pointed in the same direction, yielding valid results. Researchers were not able to analyze Teacher C’s math SAS® EVAAS® scores alongside her PDAS scores, but her social studies SAS® EVAAS® and PDAS scores were mildly related (r = 0.26). For Teacher D there were weak to strong results (r = 0.29, r = 0.92). The conclusion here is that there is nothing substantive to evidence that a valid teacher evaluation system, based on SAS® EVAAS® and PDAS scores, is in place and in use. This assertion is however limited by the small sample size herein.  Additionally, analyzing all four teachers’ SAS® EVAAS® scores over time alongside their bonuses, **researchers found that both of these measures failed to assess the teaching effectiveness construct accurately and consistently across teachers as well.** The worse Teacher A did on the SAS® EVAAS® the more money she received (r = -0.42), and the better Teacher B did the more money she received (r = 0.93). Teacher C’s monetary bonuses and SAS® EVAAS® scores were mildly related (r = 0.29), and Teacher D’s monetary bonuses and SAS® EVAAS® scores were more strongly related (r = 0.79). Again, the small sample size certainly limits generalizability here, although evidence of this occurring elsewhere exists (Collins, in progress; Harris, 2011).   In addition, three of four teachers were honored with teaching awards (e.g., teacher of the year or month awards) during the same years for which they posted SAS® EVAAS® data that at least in part led to their contracts not being renewed. Teacher C ironically received a Teacher of the Year award, awarded to her by her peers, at the same time she detracted the most value from her students’ learning according to her SAS® EVAAS® data. This raises additional concerns about whether these indicators are capturing the teaching effectiveness construct effectively, or validly. See notes above about sample size limitations.",®
t5_2qhlm,upton-ogood,1349890098,"**External Pressures**  It is also important to note that **these teachers felt that they were targeted for termination because of the performance of the schools in which they taught**, which were labeled “in-need-of-improvement” under NCLB. According to the four teachers, **administrators were under intense district and state pressure, and administrators set out or were forced to “restructure the school” and “start firing teachers.”** Teachers A, B, C, and D all felt that they were part of “a larger plan.” Because they believed their supervisors perceived them to have low, or possibly lower value-added scores than their peers, the teachers felt that they had been put “on a list.” It was at this time when they became most vulnerable, and when their PDAS observational scores plummeted.   Teacher A, for example, “exceeded expectations” on her yearly PDAS reports until 2010-2011 when a new principal arrived and ranked her “proficient” or “below expectations” across domains. Teacher B’s PDAS scores dropped as well, but her supervisor wrote on her PDAS form that she could not have earned higher scores because the state classified the school’s scores as “unacceptable.” Three different administrators evaluated Teacher C and she consistently “exceeded expectations,” but in 2010-2011 when she was evaluated by a short-term administrator, she too wasrated as “proficient” or “below expectations” across the board. Similarly, Teacher D’s supervisor’s actions became perceptibly more aggressive.   **Other teachers noted that their supervisors were beginning to skew their observational scores given external pressures to do so** (Collins, in progress). One social studies teacher stated:  &gt;Here’s the problem: No principal wants to be called in by the superintendent or another superior and [asked], ‘How come your teachers show negative growth but you have high evaluations on them? Are you doing your job? I don’t understand. Your teacher shows no growth but you have [marked them] as exceeding expectations all up and down the chart?’ **Now it’s not just this [sic] data over here that’s gonna harm us, it’s the principals [who are] adjusting our data over there to match the [SAS®] EVAAS®. So it looks like they’re being consistent.**  A middle school teacher agreed: “Well my evaluations were fine, but of course now they have to make the evaluation match the SAS® EVAAS®. We now have to go through that.” An 8th grade teacher added:   &gt;They’re not about to go to bat [for us, although] a few of them will. But **most of them are going to go in there, and they’re going to create a teacher evaluation that reflects the [SAS® EVAAS®] data because they don’t want to have to explain, again and again, why they’re giving high classroom observation assessments when the data shows [sic] that the teacher is low performing.**  A 4th grade teacher noted, “Our principal pressures us. You bet she pressures. **If you don’t make [SAS® EVAAS®], then it goes against you in your PDAS. In a roundabout way she finds a way to put that against you.”** An 8th grade advanced English teacher added:  &gt;My boss had to go to the district superintendent and explain why we needed to be kept, when ultimately the data showed that we weren’t good teachers… [But] you’ve got other good teachers who are being thrown under the bus because of this system.  From these teachers’ perspectives, it seems that many district administrators are more trusting of SAS® EVAAS® and are skewing PDAS data to match. **This makes sense in theory, as the SAS® EVAAS® is the objective system that the district has purchased, and traditional observational scores are increasingly being dismissed as subjective** (Harris, 2011). In Tennessee and New York there is evidence of local policies pushing such practices (Baker, 2012; Garland, 2012; Ravitch, 2012), **although again such practices contradict the field standards encouraging the use of multiple measures for decision-making** (AERA, APA, &amp; NCME, 2000).  **Diagnostics and Formative Uses**  Overall, Teachers A, B, C, and D were only familiar with SAS® EVAAS®. They understood that they were being compared to other similar teachers within the district, and they understood their scores were available each year via the district’s online portal system, but that was about the extent of their knowledge. **Nobody had explained their SAS® EVAAS® data to them, and none of the four teachers understood what their SAS® EVAAS® numbers meant, how they were calculated, how their SAS® EVAAS® scores could be “used against [them],” or conversely how they could use their SAS® EVAAS® scores to help them improve their instruction**. Teacher D took steps to figure out her SAS® EVAAS® scores on her own, but her SAS® EVAAS® scores still “just did not hit home” (see also Eckert &amp; Dabrowski, 2010).   The four terminated teachers **did not receive professional development from HISD or SAS® EVAAS® as a result of their value-added scores** either. However, given the scores illustrated in Tables 1-4, whether each teacher needed professional development to improve their value-added scores is disputable. Because they were terminated at least in part due to their SAS® EVAAS® scores, and because they were reportedly not given professional development to improve their scores, this too is troublesome. Similarly, **none of the teachers noted that they used SAS® EVAAS® data to inform their instruction, in many ways because they did not understand it.**  In short, no data suggest that for these four teachers in HISD that the SAS® EVAAS® system “provides valuable diagnostic information about [instructional] practices,” helps educators become more proactive and make more “sound instructional choices,” and helps teachers use their “resources more strategically to ensure that every student has the chance to succeed” (SAS, 2011). In addition, 60% of a sample of HISD teachers indicate that they are not using SAS® EVAAS® data to inform their instruction either. This is not to say, however, that this is not occurring elsewhere, perhaps in the district for the other 40% (taking into account sampling error) or in other states, districts, and schools using the SAS® EVAAS® system (see, for example, marketing testimonials available on the SAS website, SAS, 2012).",®
t5_2t187,ManyLabels,1349892656,"Thanks for the warm welcome. Allow me to get into some of the points you made.     &gt;You've already received many comments here that say the labels are totally optional. So I hope you will feel no pressure to use them. And by raising the issue you've started a terrific discussion.    I'm glad you appreciate the discussion, that's kind of what I was hoping to achieve. I don't necessarily feel pressured, especially after having read through the other comments. ♥   &gt;I'm wondering whether you are feeling the anger many of us feel about the way labels are used in the world.    I think that's exactly what my issue is right now. My girlfriend and I haven't been together for very long (a couple of months) and although I didn't need the trans 101 (I've moderated a forum section specifically for trans youth), I did become more serious in researching the issues that come with being or dating a trans person. Throughout my research I came across lots of terminology that I had to look up or ask her about, which confronted me with the fact that those terms were often meant to categorize people into sub-sections of human kind. Suddenly I'm not just me, but I'm a cisgender woman with a MtF girlfriend, so that makes me pansexual instead of bisexual. Shock!   My general thoughts after posting the thread and reading through the comments:   One could argue that some labels are simply relevant at all times, but that would imply that some labels are more relevant than others and therefor deserve to be displayed every time I post. That in turn raises the question in my mind of ""which ones are more relevant than the rest of them?"" For arguments sake, lets investigate some of the labels that could be applied to me.  * I'm a mother. * I'm a cisgender person. * I'm a woman. * I'm pansexual. * I'm the owner of a red cat. * I'm Dutch. * I'm the partner of a transgender person. * I'm an administrative worker. * I'm a daughter. * I'm kinky. * I'm a sister. * I'm a gamer. * I'm poly. * I'm a left wing voter. * I'm in a long distance relationship. * etc. etc.  So which of these are relevant enough for me to display on every post? Being a mother is just as valuable to me as being someone's partner. Being a woman is just as valuable to me as being Dutch. All of these potential labels may be relevant to the issues me and my partner deal with. For example: do we tell my son about her 'status' (as she calls it) or not? Or: are violent crimes against trans people more common in the US than in the Netherlands? I feel that I could easily address the particular labels that apply to that specific issue if and when I bring it into the discussion.    **TL;DR**   I'm glad it's not a requirement, so I'll stick with my labelless existence for now.  Much love, -L",♥

t5_2qh2p,Dudesan,1349897505,"&gt;The argument I get back time and time again is that those were laws written for the Levites, to separate or distinguish themselves from the other tribes or the gentiles.  ""Show me where it says that.""  Remember, many Christians find it more comfortable to believe in a god who doesn't condone, command or commit murder, slavery, rape, child abuse, animal abuse, arson, torture, ritual mutilation, fratricide, patricide, matricide, infanticide, genocide, and so on than to believe in one who does. Unfortunately, since the Bible (Old Testamant and New) is pretty clear about Yahweh's position on these things, holding a belief in Loving Hippie Jesus™ requires ignoring huge portions of it. Or just never reading it in the first place, which seems to be the most popular option.  Well, let's see what Jesus has to say about that:  &gt;“Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished.  (Matthew 5:17-18, NIV)  Some Christians claim that his death and resurrection ""fulfill"" this. That is bullshit for one simple reason: last time I checked, Heaven and Earth haven't passed away.  Jesus also made his views on people ""picking and choosing"" quite clear:  &gt;[Jesus] answered them, “And why do you break God’s commandment because of your tradition? For God said:    *Honor your father and your mother;* and, *The one who speaks evil of father or mother must be put to death.*  &gt; But you say, ‘Whoever tells his father or mother, “Whatever benefit you might have received from me is a gift committed to the temple”—  he does not have to honor his father.’ In this way, you have revoked God’s word because of your tradition. Hypocrites! Isaiah prophesied correctly about you when he said:    &gt;These people honor Me with their lips, but their heart is far from Me.  They worship Me in vain, teaching as doctrines the commands of men.”  (Matthew 15:3-9, NIV)   Looks like Jesus has quite a bit to say about people who ignore commandments, in fact. But maybe it's just Matthew?  &gt;It is easier for heaven and earth to disappear than for the least stroke of a pen to drop out of the Law.  (Luke 16:17, NIV)  Okay, so Jesus is a bust. Let's see what the Epistles have to say about the Mosaic Code:  &gt; If you really keep the royal law found in Scripture, “Love your neighbor as yourself,” you are doing right.  But if you show favoritism, you sin and are convicted by the law as lawbreakers. For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it.   (James 2:8-10, NIV)  &gt;All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness,  (2 Timothy 3:16)  &gt;Do we, then, nullify the law by this faith? Not at all! Rather, we uphold the law.  (Romans 3:31)  &gt;Know this first of all, that *there is no prophecy of scripture that is a matter of personal interpretation*, for no prophecy ever came through human will; but rather human beings moved by the holy Spirit spoke under the influence of God.""  (2 Peter 1:20-21 NAB) ",™

t5_2tr4p,pookzta,1349908488,"write your congressmen and women using the template below:  Dear Congressional Representative,  I am writing to ask that you please support medical use and decriminalization of marijuana because science has now verified its therapeutic properties beyond any reasonable doubt, and this important information must be learned by every congressional representative, policy maker, and law enforcement officer so that our government and health care systems can be updated and improved accordingly. Pharmaceutical corporations even manufacture marijuana-based drugs such as Sativex and Marinol, but these synthetic chemicals do not have the efficacy that organic marijuana has for many patients. Additionally, marijuana does not have to be smoked to experience its therapeutic benefits, for it can also be eaten or juiced as well. Please consider the following scientific information:  ...[DEA] Judge Young found that ""marijuana, in its natural form, is one of the safest therapeutically active substances known to man.... At present it is estimated that marijuana's LD-50 [median lethal dose] is around 1:20,000 or 1:40,000. In layman's terms... a smoker would theoretically have to consume 20,000 to 40,000 times as much marijuana as is contained in one marijuana cigarette... nearly 1500 pounds of marijuana within about fifteen minutes to induce a lethal response."" (New England Journal of Medicine: Legal Issues in Medicine, August 7, 1997 -- Volume 337, Number 6)  ""Toxicity is virtually nonexistent in natural marijuana. The toxicity levels of cannabis compounds are estimated at 40,000, meaning that a subject would have to ingest 40,000 times the regular dose to induce death. “In layman’s terms,” according to The New England Journal of Medicine, ""a smoker would theoretically have to consume nearly 1,500 pounds of marijuana within about fifteen minutes to induce a lethal response."" [1] While that amount of consumption is certainly an impossible feat, in comparison, legal prescription medications cause thousands of deaths per year. [2] Common household drugs are much more lethal than marijuana. For instance, a lethal dose of caffeine is equal to about 100 cups of coffee. [3]  In 1972, after reviewing the scientific evidence, the National Commission on Marijuana and Drug Abuse concluded that while marijuana was not entirely safe, its dangers had been grossly overstated. [4] Since then, researchers have conducted thousands of studies on humans, animals and cell cultures. None of those describe any findings dramatically different from those described by the National Commission in 1972. [5] In 2008, The Canadian Medical Association Journal published a review of research spanning 30 years, concluding that there are no serious adverse effects of cannabis use.[6]  Contaminants, however, are known to be hazardous, especially to those suffering from immune disorders.

t5_2qh6c,jackaltackle,1349929062,"So, you're saying that he broke the law--just so you're not legalistic?  I'm not interested in legalism either.  As far as I can tell legalism is when a person believes he/she earns her way to God's favor by keeping the law or doing other good works.  It would be strange to define any thing as anti-God that actually paid attention to what God said to do.  Psalm 19:7--*The law of the LORD is perfect, reviving the soul; the testimony of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple;*  Why is this in the Bible? http://www.esvbible.org/Psalm+119/  Paul said: Acts 24:14 *But this I confess to you, that according to the Way, which they call a sect, I worship the God of our fathers, believing everything laid down by the Law and written in the Prophets,*   When he 'disappeared' from his parents, do you remember where he was?  How did he know where the disciples could find the donkey and why did he tell them to tell the owner, ""the Lord has need of him""?  It seems that you are the one who is twisting things here.  So you believe Jesus sinned?  If so, how do you define sin?  Can you support your definition with God's Word?  I'm defining it as I read in 1 John 3:4:    New International Version (©1984) Everyone who sins breaks the law; in fact, sin is lawlessness.  New Living Translation (©2007) Everyone who sins is breaking God's law, for all sin is contrary to the law of God.  English Standard Version (©2001) Everyone who makes a practice of sinning also practices lawlessness; sin is lawlessness.  New American Standard Bible (©1995) Everyone who practices sin also practices lawlessness; and sin is lawlessness.  King James Bible (Cambridge Ed.)

I feel that Jesus defines the laws, and isn't defined by them.  &gt; So you believe Jesus sinned?  I never said this, I said I believe he broke some laws.  Please read more carefully.  &gt; If so, how do you define sin? Can you support your definition with God's Word?

John says that ""Everyone who sins breaks the law""... not ""Everyone who breaks the law sins"" so perhaps there are some laws that can be broken without sinning?  I don't believe lawlessness applies to people who break a few laws, I believe lawlessness refers to a person who has complete disregard for all law.  Ok, let's go to court now.  &gt; When he 'disappeared' from his parents, do you remember where he was?   So it's ok to dishonor your earthly mother and father if you are supporting the Church?

t5_2t1w0,m0deth,1349978525,"Ok, sigh.  The doors carry the armor for the larger launchers, they ARE the armor for them. And yes, other variants do have a problem when say, the guy across from me on Frozen last night took a direct hit to his LRM10, and I could hear not only the component destruction sound, but the ammo he had in there went up too, and yes, he had case so it was the launcher that went down fast.   Also, do you seriously think that doors that HAVE TO OPEN, don't add a delay to the pilot's firing time? Again, because previous games failed to reflect this...is not a fault of this game. Think about it, instead of QQing 'cause your fav build got limited, it kinda makes sense. What doesn't make sense, is to assume they just fly through the doors. Or that somehow the doors carrying that much armor flip open instantly.  As far as mentioning some of the canon builds...please note timelines on those, we may yet see them, but some don't come til much later, those refinements simply don't exist in our time yet.  Believe me, I'd love to see some of the builds quoted there...but we won't.   I can agree that the newest (2 patches ago) limitation put on SRM launchers regardless of where they sit, is a bit too much, but still doable. The spread is now crap at their max range, and they are a waste of ammo at rated range sometimes.   But then, we wouldn't have a reason for streaks to exist if SRMS were all that and a bag of chips would we?  Also, knowing what the mech was built for...considering it's traditional role on the battlefield, calling an up close brawl missle boat frame build sensible is a stretch. What you end up with leads me to believe you are just trying to hang more armor, and possibly a faster engine on a Hunchback 4SP build.  The worst part is, we should have frames better suited to this role already in game. Shoot, a Cataphract would be a far better frame for this sort of build, but we can't yet. This whole argument will most likely be rendered null in two months.  As far as armor doubling goes...so far, it has worked the best to maintain fairly lengthy, but not too long battles. Otherwise TT rules have you spectating fairly quickly. TT rules are great to fall back on, but terrible for a skill based game. We all know this already. I harken back to canon for simple things...a basis, but I don't think it's any good for tight adherence while building a playable, simulation-like game that involves human skill vs. dice roles(random chance).  As a side note, I've seen the criticism that some of these choices weren't thought out, or tested, etc. and I'm not sure that's either accurate or fair.  However the way they stumble around good explanations for these, and the usual ""It's W.A.I.™"" zinger is getting old at this point. So yeah, I agree, Paul has his work cut out for him today...and I don't think the usual humor laden troll answers are going to cut it. No matter how much I usually love his responses.",™

t5_2qm7x,kaminix,1349989304,"&gt; You can eat whomever you wish, but be aware that most people draw the lines on species boundaries. The median-functioning human is so many orders of magnitude above the median-functioning animal of any livestock breed (pigs would be the closest) that the ""draw the line"" argument, in addition to being inherently fallacious (though useful for opening peoples' eyes), is a little awkward to apply here.  I don't think it's fallacious at all. We all do draw the line somewhere, like at plants or insects. What's fallacious is to draw it so close. We say the mammalian body works just like ours in every possible sense - except for the brain.  Sure we're leaps and bounds away from most (all?) animals in terms of mental capacity, but how is intelligence even important? It's the emotional value we should be considerate of, just like we are with fellow humans (we don't base our empathy on cognitive capacity), and there's no reason to believe this isn't as strong in other mammals as it is in us. Perhaps if people were drawing the line at reptiles or something it would at least be understandable, I could almost sympathize with them (in fact this is the first time I've thought of reptiles, spontaneous reaction would be to give them a benefit of doubt).  &gt; Yes, though I would claim that it's more relative than arbitrary. Perceived personality activates a ""don't eat this"" response, which is why people don't name livestock. Everyone I know acknowledges this. They acknowledge how arbitrary/relative it is. Some people are simply comfortable without an absolute scale or place an absolute scale on their own species.  And this is irrational. With not naming livestock (apart from being very impractical) and not considering a scale you're circumventing empathy which would otherwise be undeniable.  &gt; Yes. That's the only kind of meat eater I truly hate. The people that should be vegetarians but plugs ears ""LALALALALALALALALA"".  &gt; Please keep in mind I'm providing a quote and my opinions on it as a vegetarian and former meat-eater. Don't shoot the messenger.  I don't really hate any meat eater, but I see little difference between poor excuses and complete negligence. Possibly that the poor excuses are not only ignoring the problem but actively circumventing it, and I'm not sure which is worse.  I'm not shooting anyone, I'm vegan. ♥ :-)",♥

Quirriddlenoblemort (you heard that here first, folks) knew of the prophecy that seemed to say either the Dark Lord or a child with the power to defeat him would destroy ""all but a remnant of the other"". When Godric's Hollow happened, he took that as the fulfillment of the prophecy: all but a remnant of Riddlemortnobrell™ was destroyed.   So, having found that he could not touch Harry Potter, and possibly with years to wander as a disembodied spirit, he decided to try to take the Boy-Who-Lived as an ally, so the boy would not *want* to destroy him.   Showing up at Hogwarts as Riddle or Voldemort was not an option; showing up overtly as the Noble Hero would draw too much unwanted attention too soon; so he showed up as someone different altogether, and let only the wise slowly figure out who he ""really was"", by which time his plan would be far enough along that it didn't matter.  That's my theory, anyway. I do sort of wonder about the Godric's Hollow trip: what really happened, and why did Voldemort go? My previous hypothesis was that he really did intend and attempt to kill Harry, and his ironic bargain with Lily was his undoing. People tried to tell me a while back that that is too much of a rookie mistake for Voldemort; I replied that Voldemort has to have *some* weakness, particularly in the decades before the story's present, and preening overconfidence was a good candidate.

This means that it should not interfere with an internal birth control device. However, please use caution when using any internal feminine hygiene product with an IUD as there is the possibility that they can be dislodged. When using The DivaCup, it is important to carefully follow the directions in our User Guide, paying close attention to inserting The DivaCup low in the vaginal canal and breaking the seal (suction) before removal. Many of our customers use The DivaCup with an IUD or NuvaRing® simultaneously, but we recommend that you become familiar with your birth control device’s risks (such as the body expelling the IUD, etc.).",®

On the other hand, if you're sane and in not-a-blimp shape, you're at a great time in your development to start martial arts.  You're young, more flexible than us late-30s people, and you bounce back from injuries very fast (as a group, at least, YMMV)  The biggest disadvantages you'll have at 16 are:  * Size: depending on your art you may be shorter and/or slighter than the adults you're training with.  A good teacher will help you adapt what's being taught so it works as well for a 5'7"" 140lb person as it does for a 6'3"" 305lb one, but it can still be frustrating for you at first.  * Discipline: At 16, in the US, you're right in the middle of a million things.  From high school sports, to dating, to family obligations, dating, increasing church responsibilities (if you're that type), increased academic expectations, dating, college, dating.  You get the picture.  It's easy to say ""Hey, I want to be a Black Belt in Tae Kwan Leap,"" but it's much harder to stick to that decision in the middle of all the potential around you.   My recommendation:  Find a good school, have your parents or a trusted cynic help you evaluate the ones near enough for you to attend, and take some classes.",™

Frankly, I don't know why it took so long for us to add one to our collection, as they are very plentiful.  They sometimes can be difficult to spot in the urban jungle, but if you know the signs, you can easily avoid them.  Usually, they can be found in packs.  Many of them wear baseball caps askew upon their heads, and some wear their pants so low you can see the hems of their boxers.  This is a mating habit... it announces to the others that they are ready for copulation.  In urban slang, they call it Dee Tee Eff.  Note the slack-jaw, the vacant stare in the eyes, and the general slump in their posture.  You'll often hear these guys telling stories about their sexual conquests (75% of which are lies) with their friends, and anyone who makes them feel uncomfortable and inferior will be insulted with neanderthalic barbs such as ""hey there, Poindexter,"" or ""you must be a virgin!""

t5_2qh5j,DCPagan,1350065503,"I was talking about capital and management in general; bosses are not the only providers of capital and management. If laborers could provide their own capital and management, then they would be more productive than without investment or skills in managing a business. However, not everyone has management skills, an education in finance, economics, accounting and marketing, and the low time preferences that favor savings and investment over consumption to successfully invest and manage their own business, and prohibiting bosses would preclude innumerable economic opportunities for laborers without capital and management, and would hamper investment and economic growth.  If an investor invests in capital and employs laborers, that investor's capital does not belong to his employees; for employees to claim property rights over capital that they did not invest in is expropriation. The best thing for everyone would be to deregulate the economy and to make available an education in management and trade skills so that anyone could invest in their own Garage Banks™.",™

t5_2rp9s,ignoramus,1350067531,"Just wanted to point out that the networking gurus in this thread are absolutely right about packet loss, ping, jitter, etc, which is all well and good and necessary. However, when you apply those values to a game that reads those values and physically makes adjustments for those values in-game, they suddenly no longer give a strong advantage. In some cases, they may put you at a *disadvantage*. I'm not going to cry over lag comp any more, as it's needed for any type of multiplayer online, but MW3 in particular really seems to penalize strong connections with low pings and minimal jitter. We've gone over this many many times before, but to ""level the playing field"", MW3 will use Rewind-Time™ so that players with the the best connection are dialed back a little so that their connection doesn't give them an automatic advantage. As we all know, ActiWard really tweaked this dynamic to the point where poor connections may actually have the advantage, as they are not being 'rewound' at all or very little. That's all I'm going to say about it, but suffice it to say that giving your console a more solid connection does not necessarily mean a smoother in-game experience.",™

t5_2tjl0,tommorris,1350080875,"One thing I've looked at recently is how some employers now seem to want to perpetuate a stereotypical masculinity in order to attract younger male employees.  Look into the stuff going on with Kixeye recently, and the whole ""brogrammers"" thing. Businesses buying into young male macho bullshit as a ""company culture"". Why? Well, simple. You hire a bunch of young guys, keep them there by making it like a big old frat party, with beer and Red Bull and a whole load of casual sexism. They are too dumb to realise that there might be more to life than this. At the same time, you don't have to hire any women (who might, oh, get pregnant and you'd have to pay them for maternity leave) or older workers (who have families and kids and so on, so are less likely to pull heroic all-nighters and actually insist on some work-life balance). The almost ridiculous macho culture is key to the economic exploitation.  Once you step back from the whole silly cult of macho, you see that it's there to flog you shit (you are a real man, better buy things to do manly things with), to keep you amused in a shitty job (hey, they are paying me less than the market average, but I get to make ironic misogynistic jokes with these Cool Guys®), and to make you keep up your end of the masculine/feminine bargains: I mean, if you truly love your girl, you gotta be a real man and buy her a big ol' blood diamond to show her you love her.  That's not to say there's not good bits about masculinity. As a gay dude, I fucking adore me some big old hunky man. There's a certain something about broad shoulders, six packs and, well, big, erm, shoes that does it in a way that twinky effeminacy doesn't. Yes, I know I'm shallow. But the point is that not letting that dick-thinking rule all of your life. Yes, that kind of homoerotic masculinity is sexy.

t5_2ukje,sasha_fierce79,1350095534,"Here's my addition to the contest. Based on the book, Candles Burning: http://imgur.com/BjwF8   Here is the basis of the book:  Seven-year-old Calley Dakin is thrown into the all-female whirlwind of her mother's family when her father is gruesomely murdered. The Carrolls fancy themselves Alabama aristocracy and scheme amongst themselves as well as with others to grab the wealth that undergirds the pretense. That scheming involves Calley, whose extraordinary ears hear not only the living but also the dead, whom she sometimes sees, too. She doesn't know she's the eye of the family storm, much less who she can trust, as she is carted from home to Grandmother Mamadee's to the Victorian house on the Gulf of Mexico in which she grows up. McDowell, who wrote the stories on which Beetlejuice and The Nightmare before Christmas are based, hadn't finished this lightly supernatural confection when he died in 1999. King completes it beautifully as to tone, aura, and flavor, and it's funny and intriguing, magnetically readable. Some may be disappointed, though, that in the end Calley is much less likable (she's a heartless liberal philanthropist) than triumphant. Ray Olson Copyright © American Library Association.

t5_2rd6n,Sylocat,1350150679,"HERV-K201, also known as the **Artemis** virus.  **Effects:** Artemis is a retrovirus that has no outwardly visible symptoms, but renders its victims permanently unable to produce male children. Any fetuses conceived with an XY genotype will fail to undergo sex differentiation in the womb, becoming physiologically female regardless of genotype. This trait is passed down from parent to child.  Because it has no visible symptoms, and is both airborne and waterborne, no government even knew it existed until it was far too late to contain the outbreak. Current estimates state that over 60% of the known human population of Earth has been affected, and it shows no signs of stopping.  **History &amp; Fallout:** It is believed that Artemis was genetically engineered, probably during a failed attempt to create a virus that would induce mass sterility in large populations.  By the time the outbreak was even detected, it was so widespread that it was difficult to figure out where it had begun. It was most prevalent in crowded areas with public health issues, and seemed especially prevalent in workplaces.  There was also the fact that, in some areas, it was hard to tell if it had hit. Due to physiological energetics, [malnourished women are more likely to give birth to daughters than to sons](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1698024/); and what with the droughts and famines burning giant holes in the age structures of Africa and southeast Asia, the next stunted generation from much of the third world was already predicted to be almost 3-to-1 female.  The genetic damage couldn't be directly reversed, but it could be nullified in individual fetuses via gene therapy. However, due to patent-hoarding by pharma companies (and the supply-and-demand rules of the Free Market™), corrective gene therapy was only available to those who could pay... and disgruntlement amongst the less affluent populace led to a series of terrorist strikes that shut down most of those clinics, generating a bottleneck that caused further shutdown.  Human cloning will undoubtedly be available long before repopulating the planet would become an issue, so population loss is not a primary concern... outside of nations whose birthrate was already declining (see above). All that was left to deal with was the sociopolitical implications of a full generation across the Earth growing up with a 9-to-1-skewed gender ratio. Some viewed it as the apocalypse, and there were reactionary movements attempting to re-entrench the male-oriented power structure in much of the world. Others viewed it as a miracle, with certain men chortling about how there would be reduced competition for the affections of women. The entertainment industry was mortified at the thought of losing the 18-24-year-old white male demographic, in particular...  **Pathology** (citations)**:** Human Endogenous Retrovirus K201 (HERV-K201) is a [nonsegmented](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20431148), immunoevasive, endogenous retrovirus that targets germline cells, reverse-transcribing its [+mRNA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA) into the [CBX2 gene](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2680992/) on Chromosome 17, thus mutating it to an inactive state and disabling the [SRY transcription factor](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2680992/) in vitro.

t5_2fwo,RabidRaccoon,1350170252,"The sad thing is I used Windows Mobile for ages. Sure it was a bit ornery but you could fix that with a custom Rom. E.g.  http://www.jayceooi.com/2010/08/12/download-htc-hd2-cookie-energy-windows-mobile-6-5-x-custom-rom/  And it had a selection of third party apps like Pleco and Opera that Windows Phone can only dream of. Those were all C/C++ and Win32.  The Microsoft decided to stop all those apps running on Windows Phone 7 and told everyone to rewrite fucking everything in managed C# and XNA or Silverlight. Microsoft apps like Internet Explorer were still Win32. Adobe were offered a pass to use native code but they decided it wasn't worth the hassle.  Also that third party browsers would not be allowed. By that point most of the third party stuff (which of course used third party unmanaged libraries) was running on Android and/or iPhone. So everyone just announced they'd skip WP7 and obsoleted their Windows Mobile Builds.   Then in WP8 the strategy changed again. Microsoft moved back to C++ but to a new API, WinRT. All the WP7 C# XNA apps will be compiled by a [cloud compiler](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11199234/compiling-windows-phone-8-app-in-cloud) into native code or something unless they decide not to, but if you want to use the new features you're supposed to rewrite fucking everything in C++ and use the WinRT API  http://www.i-programmer.info/news/189-windows-phone/4559-windows-phone-8-sdk-leaked-no-javascript-apps.html  &gt; It appears that you can create Silverlight and XNA apps using SDK but these will only run on Windows Phone 7.1. In other words, these project types cannot target WP8.  &gt; &gt; This seems to confirm the suspicions that, with WP8, Silverlight and XNA are no longer supported for future and on-going projects. This means that WP7.1 Silverlight/XNA apps are legacy apps  Microsoft wants the way of the future to be WinRT, whether it is on the desktop or the mobile. &gt; &gt; The best you can do is to use the upgrade option, but you cannot upgrade XNA based apps just WP7 Silverlight apps. For XNA apps all you can do is to continue to work on them as WP7.1 apps. Some of the XNA framework is available for use in your brand new WP8 app, however.   Needless to say there [hasn't exactly been a stampede to the hot new platform](http://www.plecoforums.com/viewtopic.php?p=22998#p22998)  http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/09/26/windows_store_numbers/  &gt; The number of apps in Windows Store - Microsoft’s online software shop - has apparently doubled in 10 days. &gt; &gt; The code bazaar, Redmond's equivalent of Apple’s wildly successful App Store, distributes software for x86 and ARM-powered Windows 8 machines. On 21 September it broke the 2,000 app barrier with 2,079 available downloads.  ...  &gt; The store offered 530 apps on 16 August, and broke the 1,000 barrier on 5 September, according to Directions on Microsoft. Windows 8 for x86 was released to manufacturers on 15 August. The store emerged in February with the first public preview release of Windows 8. &gt; &gt; To put this in perspective, Apple’s App Store holds roughly 650,000 apps, up from 550,000 in March, with 225,000 just for the iPad. The total number of App Store downloads to date is 30 billion. Apple's shop, which opened in July 2008, also has 400 million users.

t5_2cneq,clone822,1350173266,"of note, in your article:  &gt;Last year, TLR commissioned a study by The Perryman Group to figure out the impact of these reforms (the above are excerpted from that report). Here are the economic impact findings of that study:  &gt;$112.5 billion increase in annual spending $51.2 billion increase in annual output â€“ goods and services produced in Texas $2.6 billion increase in annual state tax revenue $468.9 million in annual benefits from safer products $15.2 billion in annual net benefits of enhanced innovation 499,000 permanent jobs 430,000 additional Texans have health insurance today as a result of the medical liability reforms  The Perryman Group claims an additional $112 billion of spending each year. This amounts to between 10 percent and 16 percent of actual state gross domestic product (GDP) from 1997 to 2007,"" Birnbaum says. ""If Texas GDP were to have increased by these amounts due to 'tort reform' over that period, Texas would have jumped up in national ranking of state GDP."" He points to data from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis that shows that Texas GDP per capita actually declined, from being above the national average in 1997 to below the national average in 2007.  http://www.bizjournals.com/sanantonio/stories/2008/06/30/story8.html?page=all http://www.statesman.com/news/news/local/new-study-tort-reform-has-not-reduced-health-care-/nRpcp/   &gt;Beginning in 2003, physicians started returning to Texas. The Texas Medical Board reports licensing 10,878 new physicians since 2003, up from 8,391 in the prior four years. Perryman has determined that at least 1,887 of those physicians are specifically the result of lawsuit reform.  ""in the nine years before tort reform, the number of doctors grew twice as fast as the population. So Texas did a pretty good job attracting doctors before the law changed.""  http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/aug/25/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-texas-added-21000-doctors-because-/  &gt; In August 2004, the Texas Hospital Association reported a 70% reduction in the number of lawsuits filed against the stateâ€™s hospitals.  Deepak Gupta, staff attorney in the litigation division of Public Citizen, says tort reform often finds businesses and health care providers shifting some of the costs of their mistakes back to the victim. Many consumers, Gupta says, don't have the money to pay a lawyer, which means that most lawyers can only take on consumer cases if there is a reasonable chance they will be able to recover fees for their time.",™

t5_2qh6c,ebookit,1350182624,"I agree I was working on a Christianity 2.0 ebook on that very notion that it needs to reinvent itself for the modern times.  My main point is that the New Testament was written for a first century world, and in many cased it has been mistranslated and we get stuff like this http://hotword.dictionary.com/catholic/ the words used in English Mass got changed recently. So the stuff I learned as a child, basically wasn't the actual words I should have been learning. It tells me we shouldn't have taken things so literally.  But anyway I wanted Christianity 2.0 to be a philosophical and critical thinking movement rather than a religious one. I wanted to reach out to non-Christians that way. Maybe I shouldn't even call it Christianity 2.0 at all but something else. I just needed a name for a working title, I can change it later.  Problem with Traditional Religion is they use the traditions of men rather than the traditions of God. That is where we get into trouble and it is the very thing Jesus taught against in his time.

t5_2qh1i,lydocia,1350201311,"My university college consisted of two departments: teacher training and engineering. I attended the former, my boyfriend the latter.   However, most facilities were in the engineering campus, so I had to go there for something (don't even remember what). I had an appointment, but this guy I needed to talk to was horrible with keeping to his schedule, so I had to wait outside for a really long while. Across the hall is the student council's office, with one guy sitting inside, looking really bored. He catches my eye, I catch his, and we start talking. Nope, not him. This guy? The most annoying person in the world, but he did play his part.  We started talking, and I remember one of my classmates saying ""I'm in the student council, it'd really be something for you, check it out!"". This guy starts telling me the same thing: ""we need people from the education department, so if you're interested..."" And you know what? I did it. Then and there, on the spot, decided I'd do something helpful for my department.   I attended the first meeting a week later. We would all go out for drinks and I decided that I'd talk to everyone for about ten minutes, so I'd all get to know them a little better. Being the only girl in the group, I did get a little bit attention  from everyone (""Woah, a girl gamer, woah, you like metal, music, woah!""), but I really cut down the conversations after ten or so minutes, moving onto the next person. This worked, for the first two people. The third one... not so much.  After almost two hours of being completely absorbed into each other and our conversation, we get a bit thirsty. We notice that most of our friends had moved to a different spot in the bar. We get drinks, join them again, find out they had tried to tell us but we were too occupied, started talking again. At the end of the evening, he walked me to the train. Twice. The first time, we missed it, so we went back to the bar and came back an hour later. Right before getting on the train, he asks me: ""Hey, wait - are you actually seeing someone?"" to which I respond ""no, I'm not..."". His reply? ""Excellent."" - right before the train door closes in between us. Most probably the most romantic moment in my life.  A little while later, we started dating and are still going strong over three years later.  Thank you, Sir, for being horrible with timetables; thank you, classmate, for telling me about the council; thank you, annoying boy, for convincing me to join up; thank you, sweetie, for being so wonderful. ♥  **TL;DR** I was late to the thread and even though my story may not be as special as the others here, it's still the best story of my life.",♥

It gets you to *love* the old codger and all he's supposedly done for you and the universe at large.

t5_2qqjc,the_raptor,1350223136,"&gt;But all the same, you can't deny that there is that part of the training that is supposed to break you down to build you back up as essentially a non-questioning machine  No, basic training breaks down individuals to build them back up as parts of a team. Basic training is also the shortest part of military training. The whole of military life isn't the first half of *Full Metal Jacket*. Western militaries actually train their troops to have a high degree of independent thinking (at least within mission parameters).  &gt;that would reduce efficiency in a battle situation, and life or death rely on extremely fast thinking, and moral objections are often to the detriment of the team.   Those kinds of snap judgements only happen when they are actually being shot at, and the military trains its troops at recognising the enemy not just shooting at human shaped objects (as at the very least that would cause blue on blue incidents). Those kinds of situations are too short for anyone to make a fully informed ethical judgement. It is usually the slower paced events that get to troops.  &gt;I'm saying this, because this is the impression i got from speaking to a few ex-military colleagues. Some of them quit the military as a result of this; in the early days they were happy to ""shut up and shoot"", as it were, but over time, with more training and responsibility, while they still did their job, for them it got harder to sleep soundly.  That could just be from the stress, or it could be they didn't agree with the Mission™. Seeing your friends killed, seeing civilians injured as the result of your presence and not being allowed to help, seeing one thing on the ground and hearing another in the news etc all put a tremendous amount of stress on soldiers. But most militaries want their soldiers to make ethical judgements.",™

About two years ago, I was coming back home from a family get together that happened in Mexico. As I was driving to start making line on the bridge, I was jamming to Linkin Park (♥) in my car. Then something caught my attention on my right. There was a truck driving next to me, same speed, with the windows up, pitch black. The guy driving the truck put some type of police lights on me and made me pull over. A thin guy carrying an M16 got off the passenger seat of the truck, and aimed at me while telling me to put my hands up, get off the car, and asked me questions about myself. I thought I was going to die in that moment, but no. I get off my car, and put my hands on the back of my car. Someone started frisking me, looking for my ID while four guys searched my car and other eight (two behind me) from a Dodge Durango behind my car aimed at me, all wearing ski masks and carrying rifles. One of the guys behind me took my walled and was looking for my ID, he asked me to show it to him because he couldn't find it. As I turn back from giving him my ID, the other man behind me laid the barrel of his rifle on the back of my head. You all have heard that you see your life flashing before your eyes when you're about to die? well, that's true.

However, I don't shut out every other competitive video game just because SC2 is my favorite.  I used to blindly say that LoL took no skill to play, but after actually playing League of Legends, I dropped the negative connotation that I had always connected with it because I realized that it does take a surprising amount of skill to play.

My dad just went along with it and talking to him now I realized he is athethist.( Theyare divorced now) Anyway my mom wanted to bring me up with the values that she had and so we want to church weekly, taught Sunday school etc. she always said she would supply me with what she was taught but once I turned 18 I could make my own decisions on reigion and if I wanted to continue on the catholic path.  By 8th grade I began questioning things but kept going to church  because my mom made me. I slowly learned about history and delevoped my own since of morales that the church did not agree with. I was lost for a while, after all my religion was ingrained in me and the idea of death being the end was the most difficult hurdle for me to jump but nothing they had taught me for 18 years made any sense especially when compared to science, history and the people who would be considered sinners were some of my closest friends. I'm 27 now and at this point in my life I can't remember the last time went to church, this upset my grandmother the most. Talking to my mom now about church, I don't think she believes it either.

That was a rap forum and I don't think you go on there daily, you just pulled that out your ass. Ticket master are not the comedian community you spoke of so more bullshit from you. You could have mentioned a comic I don't know and I might have, oh I dot know it's the Internet I would have looked him up. You again lack intellect or twisting my words around or you don't get the analogies I use. I don't listen to pop music or read twilight I was using that crowd to prove a point but I see that went over your head or you just wanted to miss that whole point I made. You lie like Romeny twisting words around and speaking on a subject that you obviously don't know and possibly I don't think you get. The suit I was talking about is an analogy. Why would I use it because I speak on something I know and have to in a way ""dumb it down"" for you to get and it's obvious now you don't know about urban comedy. Katt is an urban comic and just because you don't get his culture that he makes fun of doesn't make him a bad comic and never have I said anything bad about another comic or even named them. I'm defending him so it's in your mind if you like to come to a website and lie about what you do that's you. Why would I make fun or criticize you? I have nothing to gain from that and even if I think you suck I would keep it to myself and give you tips to help you. This is r/trees I don't come here to hate on others but you seem delusional about this. I don't like a lot of stuff here on r/trees but I don't go into that post and point out in detail why i don't like something or why this is a bad show or a group of people I don't like, like you have done then lie about being a comedian. That's stupid. Katts a stereotype of what? His environment like I said he's a product of or just like any comic today. Do you go on stage and people say ""yeah he's a stereotypical white guy."" no and that comment about hoes, rap videos and midget pimp is the equivalent to George Carlin ""cheese tits"". It's all to lure you to the greater point the comic was pointing out.  I read what you wrote and pretty summed up what kind of person you are just like detectives do when they are trying to find a killer, you see what they left behind and evaluate it based on the info you have. You again take things in the wrong light or just want to lack understanding. I don't think I was funny when replying to you do why would you assume I didn't think you was a comic based on you wasn't funny replying to me? That's ignorant. I didn't ask for a video of people you worked with that says Katt is a not a very good comic I asked of a video of you and your stand up and I made that clear. This comedy community you speak of must be a few up and coming comics that have their own views on things and must not be that big and that does not mean that's the comedy community that's your own local community.  Edit: sorry for editing so much but I would have used the enter key more but now that I know it's a burden to you I won't use it often have fun digging 😄 this is r/trees, take that negativity somewhere else and use this rule when on r/trees ""If you don't have nothing nice to say, keep it to yourself.""

t5_2qh68,gunner_b,1350314469,"&gt;The Harper Government™ has accelerated the pace of our withdrawl from peacekeeping duties.   Your chart shows no such thing.  It shows our ranking, meaning the number of peacekeerers we had over that 2 year period could have remained the same while there was a drastic increase in another countries contribution.(Chart 6 if you had bothered to include the full page instead of just selecting one of the charts there to try and spin it)  [The full infographic](http://www.peacebuild.ca/documents/CanadaUNPKOE.pdf)  Your chart shows an increase around 2005 even as the numbers were being further decreased, and clearly shows the largest withdrawl from peacekeeping duties happened from 1997-2005. Harper has nothing on the last two governments for decreasing our peacekeeping duties.  Hell Harper has even increased UN funding to a level 4 times more than Chretien had.  But all of that is nothing when you consider our drop in peacekeepering levels happened with the end of the Bosnia duty and the start of the commitment to the NATO forces in ISAF, which means due to how many members we have in the CF it would be impossible to do contribute a large force of peacekeepers. All of which predate Harper again.  ",™

Things *escalated quickly* from there. Here's the post from one of the developers:  ---  **DUDEBRO™ — MY SHIT IS FUCKED UP SO I GOT TO SHOOT/SLICE YOU II: IT’S STRAIGHT-UP DAWG TIME**  FACT SHEET  Platform: PC  Genre: Action/Shooter  Players: TBA  Rating: M for Macho  Release: TBA  Developer: Grimoire Assembly Forge™  URL: http://www.dudebro2.com  Twitter: https://twitter.com/TheRealDudebro (hashtag: #DawgTime)  Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/DudebroMSIFUSIGTS.SY2  Price: Free   In a world where brodiocity is under attack, legendary war veteran John Dudebro™ and his fiery sidekick Habemus Chicken will rise for the greater good, and a few pints of beer. Tasked by General Dawgless Lee to track down Armando Pesquali, arms dealer of unspecified ethnicity, the duo will embark on a brotastic adventure, facing deadly opponents such as Commander Limpwrist’s SkullPro army and the mysterious Dude Squad. Developed by Grimoire Assembly Forge™, a collective composed primarily of NeoGAF forum members, Dudebro™ II both parodies and pays homage to the game industry as a whole.  FEATURES:  • Old school 2D sidescrolling shooting/slicing action, running in full HD (1080p) at 60 frames per second.  • Advanced physics, powered by Farseer™ Physics, and shader effects.  • The vocal talents of Jon St. John, starring as the titular character John Dudebro™.  • Crazy weapons and upgrades allow players to unlock previously inaccessible routes and find new secrets or gear.  • Players can explore multiple locations, and warp back to previously completed areas at will.  • Dudebro can carry more than two weapons at the same time. And a knife.  • No regenerating health - Dudebro’s Brodiocity Meter refills by behaving like a bro (killing enemies, rescuing ladies, and so on).  • The game parodies the industry’s focus on testosterone-filled AAA action titles.  • The game is developed with XNA Game Studio, and will be released on PC at a date yet to be announced.  ---  Press release: http://www.grimoireassemblyforge.com/press/pr/DB2_PR007.pdf ",™

Ultimate Rewards are very flexible - best redemption is transferring to Hyatt for hotels or Avios for flights (depending on where you are flying - Avios is part of oneworld, so you can fly on any oneworld airline with these points).  Citi Aadvantage (Both Amex and Visa) - Will post the link to this deal later. Not publicized anymore, but links still active IIRC.  Annual Fee $85 per card (First year waived) 3% foreign transaction fees (Not great for traveling) 50,000 point bonus after meeting minimum spend (Have both cards, got 100,000 points) Double points on American Airlines tickets (Good for buying tickets) $150 statement credit on each card after making any AA purchase. Makes up for the annual fee (Can be of any value) Several (1 or 2 per card IIRC) free airline club passes Free Priority boarding, free 1st checked bag for you and 4 others  TL/DR: Use to meet minimum spend and to buy AA tickets. Close one of the two before the year anniversary.  Chase Hyatt Visa - To get the deal below, go on Chase's site and try to make reservations, on the confirmation page (before you input any personal data), you'll see a link to the deal with the statement credit. Mine was a different deal, but they just implemented this one.  Annual Fee $75 (First year not waived) $100 statement credit (in effect, waiving the annual fee) No foreign transaction fees 2 free nights in ANY Hyatt hotel after $1000 minimum spend over 3 months (Redeemed the 2 free nights in the Park Hyatt Vendome Plaza in Paris, which runs for $850-900/night) 1 free night in a Category 1-4 Hyatt each anniversary of owning the card Double points on Hyatt purchases  TL/DR: Good travel card.

You ignore what I've said and it's almost like you skim through what I write, might be I don't press enter but maybe you just don't take time to read what I'm typing but yiur so focused to type back quick just to shout ""I'M RIGHT YOU'RE WRONG!"" doesn't work like that. It's logic because I've seen what you haven't and it's funny you still say the same thing with no new evidence and you ask for proof...why don't you watch what we've been talking about and end this instead you come off ignorant saying something is like this but you haven't done your research. Your worst than people that think weed is bad and you can overdose on it, you haven't experienced what I have so how can I explain yellow to a blind man if he doesn't opt to get surgery to we for himself? I'm telling you yellow is bright but you don't see that, you choose to believe what you think you know but it's wrong. If you don't like dude fine but it's your opinion like I said how many comments ago? But keep on I think the real question is now why are you so gumbo to prove a random person on the Internet you're right? You can say the same but all I'm doing is just defending the fact what you say is nothing more than a opinion and ask you to stop presenting something false as a true fact you believe. Ok and a few others, you can post some links to who says Katt is not funny and I can post links back how he is funny but neither makes it true so what are you defending again? Oh yeah, he's a trash comedian gotcha.😜 Peace be upon you. ",😜

t5_2qhbp,kak0,1350346978,"It does not rely exclusively on the quran for proof. The trick is in the re assignment of ""khimar"" from cover to ""head cover"", which is an old trick.  The author0 ( edit: fixed) glosses quickly over the key question of what the khimar is. And gives a nice drawing of khimar to make it look official.  &gt;  The key is to note that the women at the time of jahiliya (pre-Islamic times) were already covering their hair, as was customary throughout history in various cultures6 and religions7 .  However, by letting the ends of their khimar hang down behind their back; their ears, neck, and chest were exposed89 .  This style can be seen in the image below10 .  The references he gives  are:  &gt; 6: See What People Wore When: A Complete Illustrated History of Costume, St. Martin’s Griffin, New York, 2008 [↩]  &gt; 7: See www.Catholicplanet.com/veil/index.htm [↩]  &gt; ...   &gt; 10: History of Costume, by Braun and Schneider [↩]  These are not serious references. I mean sure I can find references in which historical women cover their hair, but I can also find references in which middle eastern women walked around topless ( this was the case apparently until last century in upper egypt among other places).  You can see this in hadith and islamic historical literature which talks about women walking around topless, even though the scholars have tried to suppress this info.  Clothing has been an expensive item for most of human history. We still have people who cannot afford to buy clothes so their children run around without clothes in places close to my father's birthplace. And this is after industrialization has reduced the price of clothes by a factor of 100 or more.  In the time of the rasool the clothes were very expensive. And most poor went around in rags.  That's why clothing the poor was one major item of charity prescribed by islam. ",↩

There's validity in that, but I figure there are some more points that ought to be made:  1. Poor people generally live closer to their family homes. This means they're much more directly anchored to the religion they were raised in.  2. Education is a factor I think. Not because exposure to Critical Thinking™ will inevitably lead one to the evident truths of athetistic naturalism, but because in higher education settings, people can get exposed to a wide variety of ideas that resonate with them they might never have heard before.

t5_2qh1u,Iain_Angus_MacGregor,1350367506,"Islamic Art Project   Repeatedly our intellectual betters  assure us that such works as Andres Serrano’s prize winning Piss Christ  which portrayed a crucifix submerged in urine, and Chris Orfili’s Turner Prize winning work The Virgin Mary which, using elephant dung as a medium,  portrays the Mother of Jesus, are examples of western postmodern art which most of us are just too unsophisticated to appreciate.   To honor these modern artists and critics, in the spirit of ecumenism and to reach out to our fellows who follow the Religion of Peace, I offer a modest proposal.  But first -   We are told that the signature, the mark of great art, is that it produces strong emotions.  The following activities may be emotionally evocative for some demographic groups and thus produce strong emotional response.  We can characterize the activities resulting from exposure to these activities as Performance Art.     The geographical area historically called Arabia is now prefixed by the family name of the bin Saud clan; hence Saudi Arabia.  The Saudis, a gang of barbarian thugs and assassins, seized control of most of the Arabian Peninsula in the early 20th century.    The flag of Saudi Arabia is a green field on which is printed in Arabic script the Shahadah, the Islamic declaration of faith.  Beneath the Shahadah is depicted a scimitar, symbolizing the Islamic imperative to convert the world entire to Islam, by the sword if necessary.    A word about the Shahadah:  It is the cornerstone of the Mohamedan faith, referred to by its devotees as Islam.  It is found in the Koran  (surah 3 Ali Imran verse 18).  It is usually construed in English as “There is no God but Allah  and Mohammad  is His Prophet.”  This is the verse one is required to recite before Muslim witnesses as a token of conversion to Islam and proof of insanity.  Your Very Own Islamic Performance Art Project    Photoshop© the flag of Arabia.  Remove the scimitar; convert the green background to white and the yellow lettering to black.    This venue will not allow entering the result. Look it up.  Next step – Print them out 20 or so at a time on a single sheet of paper, then separate them into individual strips of paper.  They might somewhat resemble what you would find in a fortune cookie.  Printing them on self adhesive label paper is another option.    Now for the Performance Art.      Suppose you are at the cinema, and were to (discreetly) drop one of these into a urinal, printed side up.  Suppose further Mr. Hypothetical Muslim enters the lavatory in urgent need to void his bladder.  He (or she in altered circumstances) sees the printed Shahida, the central statement the Mohamedan faith, lying there with other rubbish - discarded chewing gum, cigarette butts – the usual.  If our Performing Artist doesn’t see it, or pretends not to see it and continues the natural process, he is:   •  Pissing on the name of the Islamic deity, Allah. •  Pissing on the name of the so-called prophet, Mohamed.   •  Pissing on the most central of Koranic verses and thereby, symbolically, on the Koran.     In the aggregate he is pissing on all Islam.   Here, boys and girls, is the beginning of The Performance.  Artistic sensibility suggests the title of the Performance:  “What to do?”    “What to do?”    Does he reach into the urinal to rescue his precious holy verse?  What then?   Perhaps he’ll find a sink so he can rinse it off and put it in his pocket while trying not to wet himself.  Suppose he sees one or two of these printed verses in each urinal as traffic briskly enters the lavatory for the same purpose as he?  Will he try to stop the infidels whose necessity is as great as his?  (Instead of the Shahadah verse simply being dropped into the urinal, an Artist could use an adhesive label to affix the Shahadah to the porcelain in the target area.)    *The Performance.* Perhaps he will dance around while holding his legs together, his bladder and his head threatening to explode.  Will he pretend he sees nothing, or will he attempt to prevent everyone from seeking relief?     Guys.  If you were minding your own business, trying to whiz, and some guy forcefully tried to stop you, how would you respond?    “What to do?”  Right.  Dirty filthy kaffirs, infidels, unbelievers are about to piss on everything Mr. Hypothetical Muslim holds most sacred:  Allah, Mohamed, and the Koran – All of Islam.  How is he going to prevent it?  That will be a Performance.  It will be even better if the infidels recognize the situation, take careful aim and laugh as Mr. Hypothetical Muslim watches.  BUT: Remember Andres Serrano.  This is ART.  The Tate tells us it is Art with a capital A.  Who are we to dispute these Intellectuals who represent the epitome of Class, of Culture? of Civilized Values?  We are indebted to them for showing us the Socialist Soul of the Labour Party.   “What to do?”  Now, through the loo to the stalls.  An unflushed commode is less disgusting than Gordon Brown.  Nevertheless, suppose that after using the commode one were to leave one or two verses on top of the unflushed deposit?  Would Mr. Hypothetical Muslim pretend not to see, and flush it with the rest of the sewage, or mount a rescue?  Ewwwww.  Either way, another Art Performance ensues.  (I am not obsessed with the Koran or with fecal matter.  It merely seems the two naturally go together.)  Alternatively, there are opportunities here for the verse printed on sticky-backed label paper…  “What to do?”  Not wanting to offend ecological sensibilities, little printed copies of the Shahadah printed on both sides of the paper offer additional Performance Art possibilities.  You will, I am sure, originate some of your own.  A verse pasted to the end of a toothpick makes a bonny wee flag such as used to mark the summit of a hot steaming pile of something a dog or horse left behind.  For whatever reason, the bottoms of shoes are anathema to many Muslims.  Performance Art might be occasioned by dropping these verses on streets, sidewalks, roads and paths where people, horses, dogs, bicycles and traffic can tread on, drive on and otherwise grind them into the filth.    “What to do?”  Using labels, sticky tape or by using the Shahadah to create a stencil, place the verse onto doormats, floor mats in vehicles, stairways, elevator floors, escalator steps – anywhere people walk or sit.  Place a verse where one’s bum meets the park bench, on beer coasters in pubs, visible in or on dust bins (garbage receptacles) or on the bottom of bird cages in pet stores.  There are many other artistic opportunities to be found in the lavatories of airplanes, busses, trains and trams, and on the bottoms of shoes…  If Mr. Hypothetical Muslim in Durkadurkastan hears from his local BBC Arts and Letters Radio equivalent that an Art Project has directed some small attention towards Islam, he should be pleased.  If he is not entirely gratified by the form of presentation he will write a politely worded letter to the Guardian or the BBC Comments web page explaining his objections.  That is the way things are done in the polite, civilized Islamic world that we have all come to know, love, respect and admire.    Remember, all this effort is for the sake of Art.  We do it to show our Islamic brothers and sisters that we have the same respect for the Islamic faith as its adherents have historically shown to creeds other than their particular flavour of Islam.  It is an artistic presentation of the Karmic wheel:  “What goes around, comes around.”     Peace   END NOTES  --------------------------------------------------    Lady Lynn Forester de Rothschild, James M Allwin, Frances Bowes, Henry Christensen III, Ella Fontanals Cisneros, Jeanne Donovan Fisher, Sandra Niles and Professor Allen Staley might be examples.

t5_2sc5r,DoorIntoSummer,1350383566,"There is also: “*No man is an island, entire of itself; every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main. If a clod be washed away by the sea, Europe is the less, as well as if a promontory were, as well as if a manor of thy friend's or of thine own were: any man's death diminishes me, because I am involved in mankind, and therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee.*” — though even this I take out of context, unfortunately, —originally it all is being based around the concepts of God and immortal soul of Catholicism.  Thank you for spending your time for a so detailed summation. I wish I could synthesize information like that.   &gt;However, I think you're referring more to a collective consciousness is the sense of a cosmic consciousness.  ↕  &gt;[..](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_consciousness) the average, ordinary human being is only partially conscious due to the character of the untrained mind and the influence of 'lower' impulses and preoccupations. As a result, most humans are considered to be asleep (to reality) even as they go about their daily business. Gurdjieff called this ordinary condition of humanity ""waking sleep,"" an idea gleaned in part from ancient spiritual teachings such as those of the Buddha. In each person lie potentialities that remain inchoate as a result of the individual being caught up in mechanical, neurotic modes of behaviour where energy for personal spiritual development is not used effectively nor efficiently, but squandered in unskillful ways. ..  While I am not rejecting the possibility of this and the potential usefulness of this, this is not what I am looking for right now. The majority of quotes that you’ve referenced to are also too vague or too abstract (operate on the grand scale level of things, which is not too useful for me as for an individual with a lifespan of some 50-100 years).   I guess I posted this question to philosophy instead of book recommendations because I was looking for a set of principles that can be used in everyday life to build a social structure with the idea of unanimous group consciousness which is being separated from itself by some cognitive&amp;psychological illusions and by our distorted perception of [our organism\organisms of others]. *This* is also where the problem of conflicting interests becomes important, because if you only adjust your views to see others as an extension of yourself, you’ll eventually become a resource supply source for others on your own expenses (ultimate example being giving all your property to others and becoming poor yourself). The ethical system should address such problems and give at least some discussion about how it can be solved.  I don’t know how much sense this description makes, but I’ll stop here so far because I am not sure if you are interested in listening all this either.  In any case, as I said, I am thankful to you for caring and composing a reply of such a length — some quotes (about 8-10 if to be more exact) I did find resonating with me, so I’ll be able to use them as reference point later on to decide which authors works to read next.

t5_2setk,tahninial,1350384121,"I started White 2 on Sunday evening and was playing normally but got kinda bored before the first gym playing my normal try-and-catch-everything way so I decided to start again as a Nuzlocke as I thought it might help control what I was doing and also because this is the only chance for a while I will get to play a storyline blind.  Having seen grass and water types would potentially be available, this time I picked a lovely little Tepig called Rasher and (as you can see) Oshawott tackled him to death. Skipped right over the tail whips (or growl, is it?) and critical hit me all the way into an early defeat.  But the story doesn't end there. I started again and got a female Tepig which I called Streaky. Full team details below:  ---  **Streaky (Tepig ♀)**  Level 10  Lax Nature  Asperia City  Named because bacon  ---  **Mr. Susan (Purrloin ♀)**  Level 10  Lax Nature  Route 19  Named after a female cat I knew, named after a Mighty Boosh character  ---  **Salad (Sewaddle ♀)**  Level 11  Quirky Nature  Route 20  Named because she's leafy!  ---  **Fletcher (Lillipup ♀)**  Level 10  Gentle Nature  Floccesy Ranch  Named after Jessica Fletcher (MUrder She Wrote) due to Odor Sleuth  ---  There I go into the first gym, up against the last Pokémon, a Lillipup. No problems thus far at all. Lillipup uses Work Up and then procedes to OHKO every single member of my team with Tackle. Seriously WTF.  Maybe I was under levelled, I partly had no patience for grinding with the level-based EXP system and no Audino (because I was doing it closed-book I didn't realise until Googling it this morning that Audino apparently *does* appear in routes before the first gym and I somehow just hadn't noticed any when I tried in my first play through).   Still, I never thought it would be such a bitch to start with!  Thinking I would get a few gyms under my belt before I lost, I expected I would play uintil I lost then finish the story as normal but since I didn't get very far I'm toying with the idea of resurrecting everyone and doing the gym again and continuing on my Nuzlocke. Even though I was only an hour in, I don't have starting again in me...  Thoughts?  Edit: Also are people doing anything interesting (if anything at all) with B2W2 Nuzlockes and Dream Radar / Dream World Pokémon?  **TLDR: Got killed by Hugh in first battle, then one Lillipup in the first Gym swept my team.

It's also to associate the tripod mechanism with the Surface brand.  This is designed to be a cascading effect such that when Surface launches and the crowd of early adopters get their hands on it and have it out in coffee shops, parks, bus stops and so forth, the brand Surface will be recognized by other people who have watched the commercial because they'll see *specific identifiable physical characteristics* of the device (white earbud headphones anyone?).

Earnings on Oct 23 (paid prescription are up 15-16% this QoQ).  Street consensus on of $0.77 EPS.  I'm thinking a surprise of 1-3 cents based on the 8k report.  3.  Kidney Week starting October 30, Nephrotic syndrome (NS) scripts are A LOT more valuable than MS.  There are several abstracts for Kidney Week that mentions H.P. Acthar® Gel.  It takes 7 vials for each NS patient as opposed to 2 for MS.  Each script for NS is 3.5x compared to each MS script.  The exposure of H.P.

t5_2qh5b,ConclusivePostscript,1350428849,"**Part One.**  &gt; We need not take any claims for which there is no evidence seriously.  When these claims are empirical or scientific, I agree. But when these claims are metaphysical in nature, it depends on the nature of the case. Suppose, *ex hypothesi*, that God does exist. Could God not give us knowledge of his existence through a cognitive faculty, like Calvin’s *sensus divinitatis*, that relies not on inference or argument but is stimulated by certain aesthetic or moral circumstances to produce properly basic beliefs? If not, why not? If so, it seems a person could have knowledge of God without having an argument in favor of theism. In that case, theistic claims need not be believed, but they ought not be treated as simply false, either. Not unless you have a direct argument against theism (such as the problem of evil).  &gt; If we had to tackle every baseless and unfalsifiable claim with equal seriousness, whether Scientology or the Flying Spaghetti Monster or the belief that Marvel's comic book Thor is an accurate description of reality, it would be impossible to produce useful knowledge about our universe. Evidence is a claims filter that distinguishes facts from fantasy.  Scientology, FMSism, and Thorism are baseless but not unfalsifiable. Each has defeaters that theism does not. Theism itself is neither baseless nor unfalsifiable—nor falsified, either.  &gt; This is a masturbatory argument that gets us nowhere. All logical systems, and therefore any logically coherent epistemology, must adopt a set of axioms a priori. Better to adopt ones like, ""your claims about reality must be consistent with what you can repeatedly observe and test about reality"" than ""you're welcome to just make up any shit you like as long as it is soothing to your simian ego"".  Actually, it’s a question. You seem to have tacitly admitted that there is no such evidence (i.e., evidence that doesn’t commit *petitio principii*). Good. Now why should we think reality is uniform in nature so as to be observable and testable in the first place? Your proposed a priori axiom presumes that reality is going to be in accord with your observations. Why should we not think that your first axiom is reducible to the one you are trying to play if off against? That is, why should we think your presumption of reality’s observability and testability is not itself made-up ego-soothing shit?  &gt; You might as well state that you cannot make statements without presupposing language. Of course you can't. What's your point?  The two are not analogous. For one thing, naturalism is a worldview, an ontology, that maintains the nonexistence of all supernatural entities. But repeated observation of natural entities is not evidence that *other* entities do not exist. Whereas the confirmation that language exists (as opposed to the articulation of that confirmation) does not require its own use (not directly, anyway). Moreover, the view the language exists is not a worldview or ontology and does not entail any controversial ontological commitments.  &gt; …[Plantinga’s argument] doesn't mean squat to someone who isn't desperately clinging to the hope that there is some argument or evidence for the existence of God.  I don’t know of any believer whose faith depends on this argument, so your caricature only makes you look ridiculous and uninterested in understanding others who believe differently than you. What the argument actually means, regardless of your questionable (and logically irrelevant) psychoanalysis of Every Theist Ever™, is that belief in evolutionary naturalism is irrational. That is, unless you have a *direct* argument against its premises.  &gt; Is it possible that a magic man in the sky is secretly guiding evolution…  Another caricature.  &gt; …and that if this were actually the case then we would have reason to trust our senses and thought processes more than if we simply evolved naturally? Sure. It is possible that hyperadvanced aliens did it. It might even have been Thor. Does that make this alternate hypothesis even remotely plausible? Of course not.  Plantinga is not offering EAAN as an argument for the plausibility of theism. He is offering it as an argument against the rationality of belief in EN. You’re right, theism is not the only other option—but where does Plantinga say otherwise?  &gt; But Planti[ng]a's agenda is pathetically transparent.  It’s transparent because he has made it transparent. He has never hidden his motives, as is clear from works such as *Warranted Christian Belief*. But attacking a person’s motives is not to make a dent in their actual arguments.  &gt; Why not make the counterposition to evolutionary naturalism a computer simulation, or hyperadvanced alien designers, or gods plural?  Why “Why not?” Why not “Why?”",™

Customer: ""But I don't want it anymore.""  Me: ""There's not much we can do about that, you already signed the contract and got a $500 discount on a phone.

t5_2qh13,StupidQuestionsRedux,1350476111,"First of all, finding embarrasing studies about Muslims isn't hard but I will address your points:  &gt;  soldiers in war who charge machine gun nests in war, real suicide missions  You seem to operate under a very loose definition of suicide. Perhaps in your view going outside is also a suicide mission, is that correct?   &gt; One might even say the D-Day landings were always going to be suicide missions for many.  As I stated above, apparently, in your view, all those involved wanted to commit collective suicide. The fact the majority survived means they failed in their endeavour, right?  &gt; Western Imams would say about that - they lined up to denounce the 9/11 attacks and to say that it is a perversion of Islam  Western imams like Anwar al-Aulaqi, Abu Hamza al-Masri or Mullah Krekar?  &gt; A similar Western question would be 'is it okay to send men to war knowing that many will not return?'   No, a similar question would be 'is it okay to send men with bombs strapped to their chest to blow themselves up?'  &gt; How many people support killing for their country? Same thing.   No, it's not the same thing. What does this have to with nationality?  We're talking about religion. How many British Christians think it's acceptable to kill for Christianity?      &gt; they have more of an central identity if Islam is under attack.  Because Islam is much more than a religion, it's a political system too, right?    &gt; Then again, why should Islam come under attack?  Because the sinful decadent Western culture exerts a corrupting influence on the pristine  god-fearing Islamic civilization. Couldn't that be considered an act of war?      &gt; From personal experience I don't believe it,   That convinced me, from now on I will disregard all these pesky stats because of your Lived Experience™. Or maybe not?         &gt; Notice this comes from civitas, the same pdf of which shows that a majority of UK muslims also supported Sharia Law becoming reformist and more accepting of Western values.  A reformed, more accepting of Western values Sharia but with the death penalty for apostasy, right? Very reassuring indeed.  &gt; there'd be even more that would like to think of themselves conservative until they face missing out on some of those literal niceties in reality.  How much more? Please provide a sourced quantitative assessment.  &gt; 1.68% of 5% is going to have a problem getting to the point where they can win an election by overturning civil rights. Let's call it what it is. A minority pipe dream.  As I stated previously a tiny, but loud, minority can enact substantial social change as was illustrated in [this](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/07/110725190044.htm) study. Also, the number of Muslims living in Western countries is growing and they're getting more radicalized with each generation. How does that fit in your worldview?  &gt;  49% think they can, and those that do are going to have more secular, Western kids.    And the religous majority will have a larger number of religious kids. Secular people are not as good at breeding as religious ones. Not very encouraging, don't you think so?     &gt; 51% holding onto old values in theory isn't a strong place for a religion; it's a slow death sentence.  As can be gauged from the increased [radicalization](http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/a-growing-following-in-germany-the-dangerous-success-of-radical-young-clerics-a-816642.html) of the Muslim youth, right?  &gt; Check out the rest of the UK. Speech whilst protected doesn't have this romantic US feel to it.  Yes, I know. There is no free speech in UK so criminalizing speech that offends Muslims wouldn't be a giant leap.  &gt; It has protections but certain speech is very much limited already  I wouldn't be surprised if it will become even more limited in the future. You have to protect those religious sensibilities after all.  &gt; The UK's provision is much more pragmatic and sensible  That's subjective, not everyone subscribes to the Neville Chamberlain  school of thought.  &gt; It's sad but the UK was pretty sad in this regard in the 40s and 50s. Not so long ago. Now it's the gay friendliest country in the EU  Except in Muslim controlled [areas](http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2011/06/10/gay-rights-campaigners-call-for-mosques-to-ban-anti-gay-speakers/), right?  &gt; nothing will come from this  Now that you mentioned it, your clairvoyance makes me feel much better.  &gt; Lots of Christians don't think homosexuality is morally acceptable.  0% of them?  &gt; It makes no difference to me.   Some of us are less prepared to become dhimmis compared to you. Some of the inhabitants of this continent don't consider a Europe as envisioned in Tom Kratman's [Caliphate](http://www.amazon.com/Caliphate-Tom-Kratman/dp/1439133425) something to aspire to, can you imagine that?    &gt; The British Muslim Council also stood up and said (in explaining how British Muslim soldiers should go to Iraq and Afghanistan) how even if they were Muslim first they had entered a social contract with the UK, it was their home, and that Islam taught them that they were obligated to meet this social contract.   This is why British Muslims were found fighting alongside the Taliban in Afghanistan, right?      &gt; Polls, especially when the context is open to interpretation, mean little.   Indeed, anecdotes are much more valuable, isn't that so? Perhaps states should base their policies on your personal experiences, wouldn't you agree?    &gt; Facts are, without ignoring that there are indeed some problems, it's really not a big problem at all, which is why the BNP have a grand total of 0 MPs.  Because BNP is the only far-right party in Europe, right? There is no resurgence of the European radical-right,  it must be a figment of my imagination, right? The National Front in France, Sweden Democrats and True Finns are all on the wane, right?  Edit:typos.",™

t5_2rbfw,forgeddit,1350481181,"Both (q∨¬q) and (q↔q) are equivalent to ⊤.  They are tautologies.  You can figure this out yourself either by truth table or just looking at what they're actually saying: (q∨¬q) is ""q is true or q is not true"" or just ""q is either true or false"",  and (q↔q) is ""q is true if and only if q is true"" or just ""q equals q"".  Both are obviously true no matter what q is.  Personally I wouldn't give any answer for h₁(q) or h₂(q) in a form other than ""⊤"", ""q"", ""¬q"", or ""⊥"".  Anything else is a more complicated way of writing the same thing.  (Note that only two of those are correct answers, of course.)    In my view writing something like h(q)=(q↔q) instead of h(q)=⊤ would be like writing ""f(x)=x+3-x"" instead of ""f(x)=3"".  Sure, you can do it, but why?  ",↔

t5_2qy7t,commandar,1350503654,"Network effect.  Back when Ubuntu and Fedora were first starting out, things were a bit different than they were today. Debian had all the apt-get goodness we love about Ubuntu today, but suffered from a kitchen sink mentality that meant it shipped on a dozen CDs and everything was painfully out of date.  Ubuntu took the solid core of Debian, focused on usability and getting everything up to date, and stripped it down to a single disc install. That  last point may seem kind of trite, but even Slackware was shipping on 2-3 discs back then. The fixed six-month release cycle was also something very different at the time, and was one of the things that helped make Ubuntu a Big Deal™.  Fedora, on the other hand, was born as Redhat's community distribution. It was meant to be a sandbox for developers to work on things that weren't stable enough for them to stick into the newly-christened RHEL. The first few releases were *very* rough around the edges. I don't remember much of FC1/2/3 beyond installing them, running into issues, and going back to whatever it was I had been using at the time. Additionally, yum was something kind of new to the Redhat world, and RPM had a reputation for being a nightmare at times.  At any rate, the long story short is that the perceived advantages and shortcomings of Fedora and Ubuntu at the time lead to one becoming wildly popular and the other not so much. A larger community means a larger knowledge base. RH and Debian already had different ways of doing things when both projects were starting out, but they've diverged even further today. All of this combined means it's harder for a new user with problems to find answers because the community is smaller and a solution from a Debian-based distro might not apply directly to Fedora.  Personally, I just can't think of a compelling reason why I'd *want* to recommend Fedora to a new user. Not saying it's a bad distro -- my personal experience with it is so out of date to be near useless -- but I haven't seen anything that has made me feel compelled to even install Fedora in a VM in years.",™

t5_2s960,Smallpaul,1350553218,"&gt; Capitalism is still organized crime, in the literal sense of the word. More organized than any other in the world.  Capitalism is extremely organized. But it is only metaphorically criminal, not literal. Capitalists work in the open because society appreciates their contribution and provides it legal protection, even if you and I disagree. Any politician who came out as anti-capitalist would lose an election EVEN IF the capitalists did not spend money on campaign ads against them. The statement itself would shock and offend 80% of society. So when you say it is criminal, you mean either ""Some small subset of capitalists are literally criminal"" or ""most capitalists are metaphorically criminal according to the values that we hold.""  &gt; The only difference is that capitalism has more tact - of course they don't outright murder their enemies, because that would cause unwanted attention and would actually allow the people to point and scream in outrage. They know of smarter, more efficient ways to silence their adversaries.  They are not at all consistently successful at silencing their adversaries. This is what a pack of cigarrettes looks like in Canada now:   * http://www.smoke-free.ca/warnings/canada-warnings.htm  GreenPeace has succeeded in ending the whaling practice worldwide.  Consider what's going on in these cases:   * http://whistleblower.labovick.com/articles/whistleblower-articles/health-care-fraud/pharmaceutical/  &gt; &gt; Whistleblowers are fired, not killed.  &gt; Whistleblowers are sentenced to solitary confinement without trial.   We are talking about capitalism, not militaristic imperialism. Here's what happens to whistleblowers who work for capitalist enterprises:   * ""American pharmaceutical manufacturer Allergan Inc. has agreed to plead guilty and pay $600 million fine. This will resolve Allergan's criminal and civil liability arising from the unlawful promotion of Botox® Therapeutic, ... The civil settlement resolves three lawsuits filed in federal court in the Northern District of Georgia under the qui tam, or whistleblower, provisions of the False Claims Act, which allow private citizens to bring civil actions on behalf of the United States and share in any recovery. The following whistleblowers – Dr. Amy Lang, Charles Rushin, Cher Beilfuss, Kathleen O'Conner-Masse, and Edward Hallivis – will receive $37.8 million from the federal share of the settlement amount.""  I know that our ""old system"" has not yet gone completely awry when I see that private individuals can take on mega-corps *and be rewarded for it*. I think that's great and it shows how much hard work has been poured into a semblance of democracy and equality under the current system.  &gt; Again, it's not so much about the methods involved - just because they didn't kill Bradley Manning doesn't put them on any higher ground than criminals.  Ummm....what moral system are you using where imprisoning someone temporarily does not put you ""on a higher ground"" than someone who kills them? According to my own moral compass, there is a significant difference there.  &gt;... It's insightful because in the same breath that our leaders condemn these criminal vermin, they are the ones reinforcing their behavior - an upstanding role model for the criminal industry. That's how you do crime right, they all think.  If capitalist enterprise is ""the way to do crime right"" then mafiosos should just become capitalists. There is nothing stopping them. But it is a lot harder to produce a product or a service than to stick a gun in someone's mouth and ask them to give you money.  &gt; ... I feel the capitalists would be the only ones still advancing criminal operations.  To be honest, that sounds bizarre and a bit utopian to me.  Where would the mafioso go? Do you realize that gangs of armed bandits long predate ""capitalism""? Are you saying that nobody would stumble upon the idea of violent gangs in an anarchist society? That the existing violent gangs would just dissipate like magic?  ",®

If you use shapes the player is used to seeing all the time (rather than shapes unique to your game), it takes less brain-power to distinguish them, and the player has an easier time.  As for colors, [this](http://jfly.iam.u-tokyo.ac.jp/color/) is a great place to start. But, since you only need 4 distinct colors for the 4 powerups:   Vermillion, Blue, Yellow, White. This will work across the widest range of colorblindness.  Or, if you're counting Health and Boost, substitute Orange for Vermillion, and use Vermillion Hearts for Health (fairly universal). Then substitute Sky Blue for White and use White Xs for Offensive Boost ('X' for multiplication?).  This gives us:  * Yellow '=': Split Shot / Explosion * Sky Blue '+': Auto Target / Turret * Orange 'O': Grenade / Speed boost * Blue '▲': Close Range / Invincible * Vermillion '♥': Regain Lost Health * White 'X': Offensive Boost",♥

When the economy dumps out, they pay out more *because people lose jobs and have trouble paying for food, housing, etc.* This is the design. And most people who were middle income before the crash were able to sustain themselves for several months, aka well into Obama's first term, on their tiny savings and lots of credit card debt.

I made it extremely clear what had happened, and I made no claim that the money was something I ""deserved"" or that it was payment for an item I sent.

t5_2r9po,Acromir,1350660118,"I actually have some copypasta for when people ask about my build. Here you go!  ###Traits  ##Shadow Arts (25) * 2♦ when you stealth * +1s Stealth duration * AoE Blind on stealth * 2 stacks of Might (15s) on stealth  ##Acrobatics (20) * Might (15s) on dodge * Swiftness (2s) on dodge * Healing when you spend initiative * 15 endurance returned after dodging  ##Trickery (25) * Fury, Might, and Swiftness (10s) on Steal * Vigor (15s) and two boons stolen on Steal * +3 max initiative. * +1% damage per initiative  ###Weapons  ##Sword/Dagger  This is the weapon I use almost all the time. The spam attack does the exact same damage as the dagger spam attack, but it has a cripple/weakness and it's a frontal AOE. Infiltrator's Strike is the world's best stun break. It breaks stuns, moves you out of danger, and removes a condition as a bonus. It's spammable, which is unique to us. Always have a Shadow Return available. Stuns never last more than half a second on me. Flanking Strike is meh, and only gets very rare use to remove a boon.  Dancing Dagger is a great cripple, and actually does decent AoE damage. Cloak and Dagger is central to this build. I use CnD -&gt; Tactical Strike for a daze frequently. I average a 2s daze every 5-6s. This is a great deal of support for the group, and extremely powerful in PvP. CnD actually does great damage, and Tactical Strike deals slightly more than a #1 attack. Additionally, this works well with the trait that heals when you spend initiative. It heals you as if you use 5♦ (which means 300-500 health), but only costs 3♦ with the initiative return.  ##Shortbow  90% of the time I use this weapon is in a large-scale DE (or just shadowstepping to cover ground). It has great AoE and it's ranged, so it's perfect for dancing around the outside of a large fight. This is also good for the rare occasion that I have to kite something.  ###Skills  ##Hide in Shadows  I pick this as my heal almost all the time. Withdraw heals for more, but I hate having to give up my positioning. The 4s stealth is great, and the 2♦ is a bonus. I also love the condition removal, and the regen is made more powerful by my focus on boon duration.  ##Blinding Powder  Another AoE stealth for aggro control or a revive. Also useful to restore initiative or get off a stun when I don't have time to cast C&amp;D. An instant aggro-drop panic button that even works while you're stunned.  ##Shadow refuge  It's a great defensive and support tool. Can be used for an easy revive, or to heal your allies. It's also a great aggro control, which is something that only Thieves and Mesmers can do. All kinds of other uses, like ambushing in WvW or harvesting a node surrounded by enemies. Thanks to my traits, this gives me 8 initiative, and if I stand in it for the full duration I'll get 12 stacks of might.  ##Scorpion Wire  I usually use Scorpion Wire here. It's nice to have a fast interrupt, and the pull/knockdown is a great control. I'll often immediately follow up with Cloak and Dagger, which is a near-guaranteed hit.  However, I'll replace this skill as the situation warrants. Smoke Screen, Caltrops, Shadowstep, Skale Venom, Role for Initiative, and Haste all find their way into this slot at one time or another.  ##Elite  I go for Dagger Storm, because it can do all kinds of neat things. It's a great burst of AoE damage, it's a huge projectile reflector, and it gives you 11s of stability. Just keep in mind that you don't have to cast the whole thing. I'll frequently only use this for a couple of seconds and then dodge out of it, unless I'm able to kite them around or I'm fighting people who only use projectiles.  ###Gear  ##Stats  This is a power-heavy build, although I get a decent amount of crit chance/damage. I use some vit/toughness, but a big part of my defense comes from dodging, stealth, and CC so it's not that important. Condition damage is a low priority, as my main weapon set doesn't have any damaging conditions. I pick up a little bit for Caltrops and Shortbow, though.  ##Runes I go with two Runes of the Water and two Runes of the Monk. Those each give +15% boon duration, which is a huge bonus both to me solo and to my group support ability. Right now, I'm using two Runes of the Hoelbrak for my last two, which gives +20% might duration for even more might stacking.  ##Sigils I go with a Sigil of Fire, which has a chance to trigger an AoE flame blast on crit. The flame blast triggers a minimum of once a fight, and often several times. It does surprisingly high damage and is very useful. My dagger has a Sigil of Force for an easy +5% damage.  ##Food  I go with Chocolate Omnomberry Cream. +40% magic find, and +20% boon duration. For a boon-heavy build, that's all-around epic, and the MF is just a nice bonus. I'll occasionally use a heal-on-crit food if I'm having trouble staying up.  ###Play Style  ##Damage  This build does good sustained damage, especially AoE. I get a good passive damage bonus (~10%) from initiative. With might from dodging and stealth, I always have 10+ stacks of might up. I get 58% fury uptime from Steal, which is great and meshes with my Sigil of Fire. My spike damage does not exist, and I'll never compare to the damage of a glass-cannon build, especially against a single target. However, I have good sustained single-target, and strong AoE damage. My damage is more than enough for a build with so much defense, control, and support.  ##Defenses  I never get hit. If the enemy can uncross their eyes long enough to take a swing at me, I'm either in stealth or I dodge every attack. I stealth frequently, which causes an AoE blind and lets me use a 2s daze. I almost instantly break every stun on me, so good luck trying to control me. This build excels against the CC/Burst noobs in PvP. Charge -&gt; Frenzy -&gt; Hundred Blades warriors get destroyed by this build. As soon as they knock me down, I break it and Shadow Return away. Then I stealth, dodge-roll towards them, and stun them for the rest of their Frenzy. Those one-trick-ponies melt if you can counter their one trick.  Defense is very active, and very fun. You go down fast if you take a lot of hits, but you can heal yourself up very well and you have all kinds of methods to keep from getting hit. You can dodge every 3s with perma-Vigor and the endurance return, and get constant healing every time you spend initiative.  ##Support  The backbone of my support is the boons I grant from Steal. In PvP (no food) that's 16s of fury and swiftness, 18s of might, 24s of vigor, and two stolen boons to everyone near me. In PvE, I get another 20% duration from foods (total of +80% boon duration!). I also get tons of control, and active aggro control or revives with stealth is awesome. I frequently AoE blind while fighting, which helps keep my group alive.  ##Mobility  The mobility this build offers is great. You can get 100% uptime with swiftness. Combine that with Infiltrator's Arrow, and I can cover ground faster than any other class/spec. Combine *that* with stealth, and I rarely die because of all my escape tools. PROTIP: If you're just covering ground, use steal on a white-name enemy. It'll give you vigor (which requires you to successfully steal, unlike the fury/might/swiftness), but won't put you in combat.",♦

Wanna kill yourself? Imagine this. You come home from school one day. You’ve had yet another horrible day. You’re just ready to give up. So you go to your room, close the door, and take out that suicide note you’ve written and rewritten over and over and over You take out those razor blades, and cut for the very last time. You grab that bottle of pills and take them all. Laying down, holding the letter to your chest, you close your eyes for the very last time. A few hours later, your little brother knocks on your door to come tell you dinners ready. You don’t answer, so he walks in. All he sees is you laying on your bed, so he thinks you’re asleep. He tells your mom this. Your mom goes to your room to wake you up. She notices something is odd. She grabs the paper in your hand and reads it. Sobbing, she tries to wake you up. She’s screaming your name. Your brother, so confused, runs to go tell Dad that “Mommy is crying and sissy won’t wake up.” Your dad runs to your room. He looks at your mom, crying, holding the letter to her chest, sitting next to your lifeless body. It hits him, what’s going on, and he screams. He screams and throws something at the wall. And then, falling to his knees, he starts to cry. Your mom crawls over to him, and they sit there, holding each other, crying. The next day at school, there’s an announcement. The principal tells everyone about your suicide. It takes a few seconds for it to sink in, and once it does, everyone goes silent. Everyone blames themselves. Your teachers think they were too hard on you. Those mean popular girls, they think of all the things they’ve said to you. That boy that used to tease you and call you names, he can’t help but hate himself for never telling you how beautiful you really are. Your ex boyfriend, the one that you told everything to, that broke up with you.. He can’t handle it. He breaks down and starts crying, and runs out of the school. Your friends? They’re sobbing too, wondering how they could never see that anything was wrong, wishing they could have helped you before it was too late. And your best friend? She’s in shock. She can’t believe it. She knew what you were going through, but she never thought it would get that bad… Bad enough for you to end it. She can’t cry, she can’t feel anything. She stands up, walks out of the classroom, and just sinks to the floor. Shaking, screaming, but no tears coming out. It’s a few days later, at your funeral. The whole town came. Everyone knew you, that girl with the bright smile and bubbly personality. The one that was always there for them, the shoulder to cry on. Lots of people talk about all the good memories they had with you, there were a lot. Everyone’s crying, your little brother still doesn’t know you killed yourself, he’s too young. Your parents just said you died. It hurts him, a lot. You were his big sister, you were supposed to always be there for him. Your best friend, she stays strong through the entire service, but as soon as they start lowering your casket into the ground, she just loses it. She cries and cries and doesn’t stop for days. It’s two years later. The whole school talks to a counselor/therapist at least once a week. Your teachers all quit their job. Those mean girls have eating disorders now. That boy that used to tease you cuts himself. Your ex boyfriend doesn’t know how to love anymore and just sleeps around with girls. Your friends all go into depression. Your best friend? She tried to kill herself. She didn’t succeed like you did, but she tried…your brother? He finally found out the truth about your death. He self harms, he cries at night, he does exactly what you did for years leading up to your suicide. Your parents? Their marriage fell apart. Your dad became a workaholic to distract himself from your death. Your mom got diagnosed with depression and just lays in bed all day. People care. You may not think so, but they do. Your choices don’t just effect you. They effect everyone. Don’t end your life, you have so much to live for. Things can’t get better if you give up.

Even if we’ve NEVER talked before, I’m here for you. ♥ Copy and paste this as your status to show people there are people out there that care. Like this status if you read it",♥

Make sure you use a doctype, specify character encoding and stuff like that, otherwise you'll run into a LOT of problems down the line.  Ontopic - oh my gosh they are so pretty and neat. I can't stop clicking them.  I'll give you one tip to start, though - It also might save you a lot of time if you split up your styles. You can give divs as many classes as you like, so I would make a generic 'button' class that has styles for the shape and animation and stuff, and then another class that describes the button more specifically. So then your html would be like &lt;a class=""button submit""&gt;Submit&lt;/a&gt; or something, and your button would inherit styles from both of those classes.  In fact, [just look at selectors in general](http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/html-css-techniques/the-30-css-selectors-you-must-memorize). Even the fruity obscure ones. Selectors were pretty much the last thing in CSS that I really took the time to learn properly, and I totally wish they were the first. Good luck!

t5_2tkvu,DOUGUOD,1350685436,"As a mechanic, I found out over the years that cheap tools will let you know where to spend your money. Allow me to elaborate. I got started in high school, borrowed some money, and bought a massive set of Craftsman tools (back when they were worth a shit) from Sears. After I got started I quickly figured out what tools I liked and didn't like, what tools held up and what tools were just not gonna hack it. And as a general rule of thumb, the smaller the tool the better the quality needs to be.  Wrenches for example: A Craftsman 9/16 open ended wrench will stretch and round off the bolt. A 9/16 Snap-On Flank Drive wrench will bite the bolt and break it loose and does not stretch but if you push it hard enough, it'll snap. (I said snap...ha) Gearwrench ratchet wrenches have served me very well for a very long time and are reasonably priced. Don't waste your money on high quality big wrenches. An inch n' a half bolt head isn't exactly easy to round off and even if you manage to fuck it up, a bolt that size leaves you a lot of...options.  Ratchets: The big ones? Whatever. The 1/4"" got used a lot, it's quirks became frustration and thus replaced with a Snap-On. (Narrow body, locking flex head, love that little bastard) Same with the 3/8"" ratchet, went with a custom Snappy on that one.  Screwdrivers: The Whitte® ones are fucking sweet German made drivers (Matco sells them with their name on them also). Cheapos will get you by for a bit, but keep a spare #2 Phillips...and a standard flat spare also.  Hammers: Buy a good dead blow. Fuck spending tons of money on the rest of em'.  Pry bars: Bite the bullet on these ones. Because cheap bars suck ass. Period.  Sockets: I don't give a fuck what the Snap-On dealer says, a cheap set of impact sockets will do fine. The thin chrome sockets will rip or explode when you hit em' hard, impact sockets are thicker and made out of a softer steel to prevent this, thus cheap has served me really well.  All my chrome sockets are Craftsman still, although I'm looking at upgrading my 1/4"" set.  I may add more later if you want. My phone is about dead, so I gotta go...  ",®

When someone asks a question about equipment or says they have a problem with theirs.. heaven help if someone says they wish they had an (insert expensive camera name / lens type here) the same old idioms get trotted out ""It's all about the photographer, not the kit"" etc.   And whilst there's truth in the fact that ability is vital (as it is in any art or sport, I should think) - it's hugely unhelpful to hear it / see it every time and if I were on the receiving end I'd come away with a bit of a bitter taste about photographers in general. ""Smug, self righteous bastards"" I'd think..   To say nothing of the irony that no matter what we say here - the current day pros seem to shoot with the high end / expensive kit. The L glass, the 5DMk3s etc. - it seems hard to maintain the argument that the kit doesn't matter when the pros have all already invested. I know there's an argument for reliability in there as well but I dare say there's more to it than that - but pride prevents folks from opening up and simply saying ""Do you know what? The new D800 / 5DMk3 / whatever is *superb* in low light. That'll really help me to catch those shots I've missed or couldn't take up till now"".

t5_2qpp6,romaths,1350726520,yeah I would like the idea of replays to get casted ingame. Maybe you can tab between just replays and casted replays. In the casted replays you can choose a caster of all that cast the replay and watch it with his commentary.  It could also be included that progamers after a ladder game choose to host the replay so it appeares a replay and casters can choose to cast it.  when you watch a pro replay it could somewhere show there sponsors or if casted the sponsors of caster and gamer (obviously they can't show all at once but maybe they got like 4 spaces anywhere and you can manage if you either show always one sponsor or if you rotate..)  all in all there a so many ways of making something new happen they just have to pick one idea and make something. even though I love the game as it is as well I'm looking forward to every new feature like this that makes it in the game ♥,♥

A bro should not have ""an outfit"".  59. A bro should not wear a white belt.  60. A bro should never wiggle out of a pair of pants  61. ""A bro will, in a timely manner, alert his bro to the existence of a girl fight."" A Bro must never hesitate before communicating the possibility of fisticuffs between two humans of the female variety [[HENCEFORTH ""GIRL FIGHT""]], in an effort to make possible and probable that another Bro or Bros can partake in observation. A timely manner is open to interpretation based on the initial Bro's viewing and processing of the potential feminine conflagration. Said Bro must use any and all methods of media distribution at his disposal, including but not limited to: telecommunications, elbow nudging, fiber optics, the Broney express, and postcards. If an informed Bro is unable to witness the girl fight firsthand, the spotter Bro is responsible for documenting and relating details of the girl fight via pictures, video*, or barring any other reasonable method, interpretive dance and/or pantomime. Tabling Bro obligations to witness a XX chromosomal scuffle is not only condoned, but encouraged  63. A Bro shall never reveal the score of a sporting event to another Bro until that Bro has three times confirmed it's cool.  64. A Bro may not speculate on the expected Bro / chick ratio of a party or venue without first disclosing the present-time observed ratio.  65. If a Bro, for whatever reason, becomes aware of another Bro's girlfriend's birthday and / or anniversary date, he shall endeavor to make that information available to his Bro, regardless whether he thinks his Bro already knows.  66. One Bro makes a solo chick attack. A second Bro provides a crutch. A third Bro rounds out the pack. But a fourth Bro is one too much.  67.

A Bro shall honor his father and mother.  69. In the event that two Bros acquire the same target, the Bro with the longe  70. In a scenario in which two or more Bros are engaged in entertainment of the adult variety, one Bro is forbidden from intentionally or unintentionally touching another Bro in ANY capacity, including but not limited to; the high five, the first bump, or the congratulatory gluteal pat. Winking is also kind of a no-no.  71. A Bro much provide his bro with a ticket to an event if said event involves the second Bro's favorite sports team in a playoff scenario.  72. A Bro must always reciprocate a round of drink(s) among Bros with the assumtion that no existing wager supersedes this purchase and exchange of spirits.  73. If a Bro suffers pain from a permanent dissolution of a relationship with a lady friend, a Bro shall offer nothing more than a ""that sucks, man"" and copious quantities of beer. A Bro will also refrain from pejorative commentary – deserved or not – regarding said lady friend for a period of three months, when the requisite BACKSLIDE WINDOW has closed.  74. Should a Bro pick up a guitar at a party and commence playing, another Bro shall point out that he is a tool.  75.

Should a Bro discover his Bro is in fact adopted, he is free to pursue his Bro's adoptive mother, but only after first corroborating non-biological parentage through notarized birth certificates, hospital records, or comparative dioxyribonucleic acid gel electrophoresis, whichever is easiest. Since the adopted Bro cannot legitimately claim to have shared a canal with his Bro.

I wrote that just for you ♥  &gt;&gt;So if I understand this right, the whole incident irrelevant and semantic bullshit, and Romney is just trying to squeeze out some political backing by making Obama seem weak on terror.   Er, sort of. There's a real issue (terrorists attacked an embassy), but it's difficult for Romney to attack it without looking like he's trying to exploit the deaths of Americans. The semantic stuff appeals to the fringier right because it's a conspiracy (""It was a coverup!"" or ""He doesn't want to say bad things about terrorists because he's Muslim!"", and the more mainstream conservative media has picked it up. For them, I imagine it's an excuse to talk about the Libya attacks WHICH KILLED AMERICANS UNDER OBAMA'S WATCH 'CAUSE HE'S A PUSSY ON TERROR, without explicitly saying all the caps-lock stuff there.

If he had actually said something like, ""I believe my opponent is too weak against terrorists, such as in the Libya incident when several American citizens were murdered"", cool.

t5_2qls5,sacundim,1350790757,"I love the looks and quality of most Citizen slide-rule watches.  However:  1. The slide rule crown at 8 o'clock looks like the one on my Japanese-market Promaster Sky (Japanese version of the former US market [Chrono-Time AT](http://www.ablogtoread.com/citizen-eco-drive-chrono-time-at-watches/)).  That crown is a disaster and extremely hard to operate.  I hope it's not the case here as well. 2. I looked up [the instructions for the watch (PDF file)](http://api.citizenwatch.com/files/calibers/H800_ebook.pdf), and it's yet another Citizen chronograph with a [modal interface](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_(computer_interface\)) that requires you to switch modes to use the chronograph function.  I find this annoying; though to give credit where it's due, this one is less annoying than other previous ones.  Basically, in my opinion, the one really good Citizen radio controlled chronograph movement is the H610 found in the discontinued US-market [Chrono-Time AT](http://www.ablogtoread.com/citizen-eco-drive-chrono-time-at-watches/).  I believe this movement today is only used in $1,000+ USD Japanese-market watches like:  * [This Promaster Sky](http://citizen.jp/promaster/lineup/sky/by0080-57e.html) and variants (which I would consider trading my older one for, given that this one has a better slide rule crown). * [This Attesa](http://citizen.jp/attesa/lineup/rcw/by0094-52e.html) and variants. * [This Exceed](http://citizen.jp/exceed/lineup/rcw/745101.html) and variants.  The Japanese watches come with sapphire crystal, anti-reflective coatings and specially hardened titanium (which Citizen trademarks as Duratect™).  They're hella expensive, though.  **TL;DR:** Read [the instructions](http://api.citizenwatch.com/files/calibers/H800_ebook.pdf) and think about whether you'd find the way the chrono function works annoying.  If you think not, go for it.  Or consider hunting down a discontinued Chrono-Time A-T—nicer interface, downsides are (a) larger watch (46mm) and (b) no sapphire.",™

t5_2qhwn,aikidont,1350799063,"That makes more sense.  Although I must admit that the soap opera part of my aikido career was really fun, in a naive, ignorance is bliss sort of way.  At this point it is simple curiosity and the desire to understand the people, events and general history of an art I've been involved with off and on for about a decade, and probably will be involved in for the rest of my life.  When I see things like the seminars Pranin has been hosting and this one coming up with him and Hendricks, I see a chance to learn some aikido from a fellow who has a really thorough understanding of both aikido and Daito Ryu's history.  The chance to mingle this into the practice and approaches to teaching various techniques that happens in seminar settings seems like a boat load of fun.  I've seen a bunch of different people show a bunch of very effective ways to practice and execute a given technique or principle (with times where a single approach would revolutionize everything I do), but I've never been to a seminar where the teacher is using a combination of documented historical sources and the results of a 40-something year long career to frame the curriculum.  That sort of history is simply fascinating to me.  As for all of that DaVinci Code stuff ... well, I got nothin for that, that's just weird.  I think perhaps you're a bit jaded when you hear people use Morihei's name.  When I read about Pranin conducting a class around Morihei's aikido, I just see a class where the teacher uses the material we have to attempt to convey what he was doing or how he was doing it at a given point in time.  I don't see it as a Gnostic True Aikido™ cult where one will learn the One True Gospel as espoused by Morihei Ueshiba, son of God.  Perhaps that is where the ""what Osensei intended"" part comes in.  I don't care much about what he intended, either, but I do care about what he did.    Some of the other stuff, such as Pranin's thrust about martial efficacy, I go back and forth on.  These days I tend to agree with him because I've come to think that such efficacy necessarily requires a foundational familiarity with firm grabs, resistance and other ""base"" issues that go along with one person trying to ring the bell of another.  The softer stuff comes later, and perhaps that's something that the Iwama newsletter failed to tell everyone, but I don't see how someone can prepare for physical altercations without this stuff.  Combine this with the amount of pure, 100% non resistant aikido I've seen in ASU (not all of it! There is a fuckton of awesome aikido in ASU as you know far better than me; it's just the group I've associated with the most), where entire groups of senior students have come up through the ranks with just no clue what it's like for someone to try to take you down and submit you or just clock you in the noggin, and I can see why martial efficacy is a serious topic of discussion.  These two things, personal development and martial effectiveness, are not tied together unless the individual ties them together, which is why we have such disparate aikido groups where one aspect might be heavily present and another entirely absent.  Sorry for the long winded response.  When issues such as what is in the article come up it's difficult to talk about them without sending about twenty different sacred cows through the meat grinder.  This isn't history's fault nor is it an attempt to skew the historical information we have in favor of one person/group or another, in my opinion.  Certainly, it gets twisted that way by some people, even some whose work and martial arts I hold in high regard, but I don't think it's an issue of jumping on ""Osensei's Real Stuff bandwagon"" so much as it is the dissemination of the culmination of someone's career (that is, study of Morihei's life and a practice career guided by a student who spent quite a lot of time with Morihei) via the seminar format.  To compare, when I read about people such as Harden using Osensei to push their IS wares I get a bit fidgety.  When I read about Pranin using Osensei to push his wares, and his wares happen to be a bunch of history shit and a buttload of time spent with someone who spent a metric fuckton of time with Morihei compared to anyone else, I think ""oh hey, that might have some historical merit.""

Gross report to have evidenced and quantified DMT, along with its structural analog bufotenin (5-OH-DMT), in human blood and urine.[42] In an article published four months later, the method used in their study is strongly criticized, and credibility of their results challenged.[43]  In 2001, surveys, made in research articles, point that few of the analytical methods previously used to measure levels of endogenously formed DMT had enough sensitivity and selectivity to produce reliable results.[44][45] Gas chromatography, preferably coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS), is considered a minimum requirement.[45] A study published in 2005[28] implements the most sensitive and selective method ever used to measure endogenous DMT:[46] liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry with electrospray ionization (LC-ESI-MS/MS) allows to reach limits of detection (LODs) 12 to 200 fold lower (that is, better) than those attained by the best methods employed in the 1970s.

t5_2qh16,puppymeat,1350845282,"&gt;charge $35 to prove your innocence knowing many peoples gut reaction when being accused of something they didnt do..is to want to clear their names  You know the ISP doesn't profit from the $35 dollars, right?  Nor does the person who reports the IP.  I guess I should probably recap my last discussion I had with reddit about this.  &gt; Why do I have to pay someone to win?  Probably to discourage people from trying to flood the system with challenges when they are actually guilty but have little to lose by trying?  But I agree, it would also be acceptable to have the appeal free, but if you lose, pay a fee for wasting everyones time. ___ &gt; How long is that going to take?  I don't think this is known and is up to the individual ISP to determine. Based on some things you will learn below, it's in their best interest to do it promptly. ___ &gt; Are my services for the internet (That I am still paying for while this council is judging) still going to be affected?  Short answer, NO.  (More explanation provided in my next quote of you below.)  The first **FOUR** alerts you get about your copyright infringement have **NO CONSEQUENCES AT ALL** beyond being notified by your ISP that you are breaking the law.  On the fifth, the ISP has the option to affect your service in some way that does not involve shutting it off. From the pdf included in the article:  &gt; If, after these educational and acknowledgment alerts, the subscriber’s account  still appears to be engaged in content theft, the ISP will send yet another alert.  At  this time, **the ISP may take** one of several steps, referred to as “**Mitigation  Measures**” reasonably calculated to stop future content theft.  **These Mitigation  Measures may include**, for example: **temporary reductions of Internet speeds,  redirection to a landing page until the subscriber contacts the ISP to discuss the  matter or reviews and responds to some educational information about copyright**,  or other measures (as specified in published policies) that the ISP may deem  necessary to help resolve the matter.  **ISPs are not required to impose any  Mitigation Measure which would disable or be reasonably likely to disable the  subscriber’s voice telephone service (including the ability to call 911), e-mail  account, or any security or health service (such as home security or medical  monitoring). The ISP may also waive the Mitigation Measure.**  Also,  &gt;Is termination of the subscriber’s account part of this program?   &gt;• No.  This alert system does not, in any circumstance, require the ISP to terminate  a subscriber account   So if you don't want to have a reduction of service, resist the urge to pirate constantly after your fourth warning. This doesn't sound very difficult.  ___ &gt; Will they ""refund"" me for the lost services they enacted for punishment of something I didn't do?  This isn't even a valid concern. According to the document:  &gt;Under this system, **before a Mitigation Measure is imposed, a  subscriber may request independent review to invalidate the alert** and avoid any  Mitigation Measure on the basis that the online activity in question is lawful (e.g.  protected by fair use or authorized by the owner of the copyrighted material) or  that the subscriber’s account was identified in error.  So, as you can see, if you decide to challenge one of the notices, your service will not be altered until the ruling occurs. ___ &gt;Is there any incentive for them to not find me guilty?  There is no incentive whatsoever.  The cable company does not do the ruling. It is done by a non partial third party. &gt;A qualified, independent entity, separate from the Center for Copyright  Information, will be engaged to establish and operate the Independent Review  mechanism.   Just to be clear, the independent entity will be paid either way, so it's not in their best interest to rule you as guilty.  If you're guilty, they get paid by you. If you're innocent, then the ISP made a mistake and they pick up the tab.  The independent entity doesn't lose either way.   ___ &gt;Honestly I don't believe private business should be in the business of enforcing laws.  The six strike policy is not a law.  They implement these rules so they can remain in the safe harbor for the DMCA.  &gt;...section 512 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act requires that the ISPs have in place a termination policy for repeat copyright  infringers as a condition of availing themselves of the Act’s “safe harbor”  provision.   This is why subscribers have a right to know if it has been alleged that  content theft is taking place on their accounts, and a right to respond.  ___  **EDIT:** Someone posted a comment but has since deleted it before I could post my answer.  Since it gave me a chance to clear up some more misconceptions, I'll add it here.  The Post:  &gt;&gt;*Just to be clear, the independent entity will be paid either way, so it's not in their best interest to rule you as guilty. If you're guilty, they get paid by you. If you're innocent, then the ISP made a mistake and they pick up the tab. The independent entity doesn't lose either way.*  &gt;There is an inherent bias toward the ISP. Since the independent entity knows they will always be paid, they are incentivized to rule in favor of the party who hires them. The independent entity is not non-bias, when they depend on one party for future employment.  My Response:  &gt; There is an inherent bias toward the ISP.   No, just no.  From [here](http://www.copyrightinformation.org/node/709):  &gt; Another significant feature of the CAS is the ability of consumers to seek review of alerts they believe were sent in error. Content owners and ISPs want the system to be accurate. And we have established a fair and transparent process to correct errors should they occur. To do this, CCI developed an independent review program to be operated by the American Arbitration Association (AAA). AAA is a highly respected, neutral organization with deep experience in administering similar programs. The review system will allow consumers to ask a trained, impartial professional at AAA to review alerts fairly and confidentially, while honoring their expectation of privacy.   So who is the [AAA](http://www.adr.org/)?  &gt;The American Arbitration Association® (AAA), is a not-for-profit organization with offices throughout the U.S. AAA has a long history and experience in the field of alternative dispute resolution, providing services to individuals and organizations who wish to resolve conflicts out of court.  &gt;The AAA's official mission statement and vision statement are based on three core values : integrity, conflict management, and service. The AAA has long held its mediators and arbitrators to strict codes of ethics and model standards of conduct to ensure fairness and impartiality in conflict management. To further ensure the AAA's integrity, however, the Association also developed Standards of Ethics and Business Conduct for its staff, as well as a general Statement of Ethical Principles to expand on its core values as an organization. Finally, the AAA -- as a not-for-profit organization -- has a core dedication to service, and particularly education, in the field of alternative dispute resolution.  It's a not-for-profit organization whose entire existence is staked on the fact that they are extremely serious about being impartial.  If they were to do what you suggest they would, it would ruin their integrity as an organization.  If you're going to make wild claims of bias, you better provide actual facts, rather than your your random guesses.",®

t5_2qh16,crotchpoozie,1350851133,"&gt;""Saving"" for the future, in the current Zimbabwean economic atmosphere is a losing proposition, thanks to the way fiat money always fails. It was the same in Argentina, Germany, and now in Europe.  Picking the worst examples to demonstrate a general case is poor logic. If I point out the best examples, where a population has had long term stability and growth, does that make it true for all? No.   Average case - think about what that means.  &gt; Did you know the richest man in the world said that even giving money away in charity, trillions of dollars of it, does NOT work?   Irrelevant to discussion.  &gt;Having paper backed by nothing but the words of lying politicians is good?  The value of money is backed by the productive assets of an economy. Your words don't make it sound like you're interested in understanding how reality works.  There are ample examples of countries on proper gold standards, the country getting into economic trouble, and politicians causing all sorts of havoc with the money system. So if you have politicians willing to screw up an economic system no money system is stable. In fact, if you dig, I expect you can find more examples of failed gold standards because of political wrangling than you can failed fiat currencies.  The fact is - any political system can screw up any money system with equal ease.   So again, irrelevant to the historical evidence for or against commodity money versus fiat.  &gt; &gt; This is why all countries dropped the gold standard   &gt; Not true.  We just covered this. You posted a link to an article you claimed showed some non-fiat countries, but zero were listed.  So - which countries are still on a gold standard?    &gt; &gt; So you're afraid of ""backed by nothing,"" yet you put forth BitCoin?   &gt; It is backed by something, do you know what?    &gt;&gt; Backed by some random collection of electrons somewhere, which is basically nothing?   &gt; No...you do not understand bitcoin.  What gives it inherent value, as you listed inherent above? Explain it.   &gt; &gt; And it suffers from the same monetary problems economists have noticed the past several hundred years?   &gt; It is following about perfectly the ""Gartner Hype Cycle"".  This does not answer the question, and the misdirection is ridiculous. Again, how will Bitcoin avoid deflation when it runs out of new coins? Note that subdividing money does not avoid the problem.   &gt;Economies are changing and the world needs a better system. Did you know bankers are making the same thing as bitcoin, but their own version? The same people you trust in are following a... a... programmer?  Link?   Of course the world could always use a better system, but it is very hard to make one that works, and BitCoin exactly duplicates many features that a money supply should not have. It is far worse than even gold in it's limited size.  &gt; &gt; You'd get the same crap if an average economist designed a programming language - crap.   &gt; Dont tell the Swedes that‼  How does this even address that? I've seen bitcoin people claim MasterCard is about to release a BitCoin MasterCard, except masterCard has stated this is not true. So don't expect me to believe your BitCoin banking based on a forum post on a BitCoin site. Be sure to get back on this if it happens.  &gt;Hardly, centralizing anything that controls the life of millions from the hands of a few is called what model? → Communism. (See my username?)  Ok, I think we're done here. You have little understanding of communism. Words have meaning, and now you're labelling anything centralized that affects many people with Communism? Ridiculous.  Laws control the life of millions, always has, always will, so by your usage every political system is communism. Ridiculous.  &gt;This is the second Depression in about 80 years.  Yep, and the greatest economic growth in history and the fastest gain in quality of life in all of history. If you only look at the outlier events you miss the gains. ",‼

Citation needed.  In my experience, ""disk"" has *always* been the common spelling for magnetic disks, internal or external. [Wikipedia agrees](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spelling_of_disc):  &gt;By the 20th century, the k-spelling was more popular in America, while the c-spelling was preferred in the UK. In the 1950s, when the American company IBM pioneered the first hard disk drive storage devices, the k-spelling was used. **Consequently, in Computer terminology today it is common for the k-spelling to refer mainly to magnetic storage devices**[3] (particularly in British English, where the term disk is sometimes regarded as a contraction of diskette, a much later word and actually a diminutive of disk).  ... &gt;Some latter-day competitors to IBM prefer the c-spelling. In 1979, the Dutch company Philips, along with Sony, developed the compact disc medium; here, the c-spelling was chosen. **The c-spelling is now used consistently for optical media such as the compact disc and similar technologies.**[4]  (emphasis mine)",©

t5_2qi0a,wadcann,1350880596,"I'm not a lawyer, but:  [Using the Trademarks of Others](http://www.citmedialaw.org/legal-guide/using-trademarks-others):  &gt;* Nominative Fair Use: The nominative fair use defense protects your ability to use a trademark to refer to a trademark owner or its goods or services for purposes of reporting, commentary, criticism, and parody, as well as for comparative advertising. Courts impose three requirements on defendants who want to take advantage of the nominative fair use defense: (1) the trademark owner, product, or service in question must not be readily identifiable without use of the trademark; (2) the defendant must use only as much of the mark as is necessary to identify the trademark owner, product, or service; and (3) the defendant must do nothing that would suggest sponsorship or endorsement by the trademark owner. This defense works against trademark infringement lawsuits. The federal dilution statute, found at 15 U.S.C. § 1125(c)(3)(A), also makes nominative fair use a complete defense to trademark dilution claims. Some examples of nominative fair use include a newspaper's use of the ""New Kids on the Block"" trademark to create and report on polls asking readers questions about the musical group's popularity; another newspaper's use of the trademark ""Boston Marathon"" in order to report on the sporting event; and a photographer's use of ""Barbie"" dolls in parody photographs that criticized Mattel's famous toy and the values she represents. Another example from our database is law blogger Eric Turkewitz's use of the Avis and Hertz logos in a blog post about a lawsuit involving these two companies. (Note, however, that there is some question about whether using a logo, rather than just a textual reference, would qualify as a fair use under the three-part test outlined above.)  also:  &gt;First Amendment Defenses: Courts have recognized a number of additional ""First Amendment"" defenses in particular situations. For example, in Rogers v. Grimaldi, 875 F2d 994 (2d Cir. 1989), the Second Circuit Court of Appeals held that a filmmaker could use Ginger Rogers' trademark (her name) in the title of a film called ""Ginger and Fred,"" even though the film was not primarily about Rogers. The court indicated that trademark law should be applied to artistic works ""only where the public interest in avoiding consumer confusion outweighs the public interest in free expression."" The specific details of these defenses is beyond the scope of this guide; the point to keep in mind is that courts may act to protect your right of free expression even if what you are doing doesn't fit nicely into one of the categories above.  My own view, which is not informed by any specific case history and is not that of a lawyer, is that it's probably fine.  At the end of the day, trademarked products are part of our society and culture.  The point of a trademark isn't to keep you from *talking* about something, but to keep you from *misrepresenting* yourself as being the creator of a production.  Avoiding misrepresentation is essential to permit building reputation.  Building reputation is important for our markets to function, for people to be able to choose to purchase products from someone who they have been happy with in the past.  If it's illegal for someone else to sell cereal under the name ""Wheaties"", as trademark law provides, then people can build up reputation associated with those Wheaties and know that, for example, cereal sold as ""Wheaties"" means that a product is of high quality and is satisfactory.  But that doesn't mean that you can't write a book or have a reality TV show or so forth in which the main character eats Wheaties for breakfast.  It's obvious there that the reality TV show isn't part of the Wheaties product line.  Now, all that being said, there should also be no possibility of confusion that the owner of the trademark is endorsing your own product.  A standard legal CYA (probably not necessary for the use you're making, but strengthens a legal position by providing an argument) may be to include the boilerplate stuff that you [may have seen on ads or other things that reference trademarks of someone else](http://aboutus.lego.com/en-us/legal-notice/fair-play/):  &gt; ""LEGO®is a trademark of the LEGO Group of companies which does not sponsor, authorize or endorse this site"".   I probably wouldn't list the ""Colt Bushmaster"" on the packaging or wherever where you don't want to make that disclaimer available without a purchase; again probably not a hard requirement, but strengthens your legal position.  And I would not use the Colt logo in the description, but simply the text.  You're simply describing a real-world gun to the user, and you need to use the text to make it clear which you are talking about.  The only minor point of confusion — and I'm not familiar with the case law here — is that there *are* license games that *do* specifically enjoy being able to claim that they are endorsed by the licensee, especially sports games and (closer to this) driving games, to the point that driving games routinely *do* license the car.  Whether-or-not requiring driving licenses would hold up in court, Ferrari *has* C&amp;Ded game creators who [don't have licenses](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20091102/2115416771.shtml).  Note that Ferrari can claim whatever they want; just because Ferrari does this doesn't mean that they would prevail in a lawsuit.  But I suspect that most people don't want to hassle with Ferrari on the point of a lawsuit.  There have been numerous commercial games in the past, like *Jagged Alliance 2*, which have referenced many weapons, and I strongly doubt that they went out to gun manufacturers and tried to get licenses.  EDIT: Please note that I am referring to law in the United States.  If you're dealing with some different jurisdiction, I've no idea how closely things run to the US.",®

I always thought that was from the phasing out of existence.  This is confirmed in the official producers' FAQ on the trilogy DVD set.  http://bttf.wikidot.com/official-bttf-faq#toc7  ""The Secrets of the Back to the Future Trilogy A: Our intention regarding old Biff was that upon his return to 2015, he would be erased from existence because he had changed his entire destiny by giving his younger self the Sports Almanac. (Probably, Lorraine shot him sometime around 1996!). After old Biff clutches his chest and staggers (the same symptoms that Marty exhibited in Back to the Future when he was beginning to be ""erased""), we actually filmed him falling onto the street and vanishing, and we previewed the movie this way (see The Secrets of the Back to the Future™ Trilogy). However, the vast majority of the audience did not understand it, so we decided to cut it out, leaving the answer ambiguous, and subject to various interpretations — besides the above explanation, you can believe that Old Biff had a heart attack from the shock of time travel of from flying the car, or from something that happened to him in 1955.""",™

As a london native I was flabbergasted by the level of detail and accuracy present. I know the japs are famous for their accuracy in anime, and I've watched stuff like [sora no woto](http://img.zonafandom.com/2010/02/soranowoto.jpg) so I know what its like, but it still caught me off guard. I could probably tell to within a season when they went to london for research based on the completion of the shard. The proper cockney cab driver also really caught me off guard, hilarious. I did hear an american voice though, which was a bit disappointing considering that most of the voices were propah laahndan voyces.  As far as the film went though, pretty middling. Didn't spend enough time in London doing london things for my liking, but I'll live. Some surprising amount of actual depth (although you had to look for it) as they try and struggle with azusa's identity and place in the band with regards to the age difference. LoGH this is not, but it's a step at least. The songs were a disappointment, only two new songs iirc, which was pretty disappointing, far too much repeated material from the TV series for my liking. So the songs were a disappointment but the rest of the film was great. I went in expecting Cute Girls Doing Cute Things™ and got exactly that, I can't complain on that front.   Also I was pretty disappointed by the briefest of scenes, where Yui is packing and her parents are present. As far as I can recall, Yui and Ui's parents have never been shown before, which ruined my fan-theory that her parents were killed in a horrific accident when she was young and she formed split personalities - her mature and responsible Ui and her wild and childish Yui - as a result of the trauma.  But a small blemish on a perfectly acceptable film. A complaint can perhaps be levelled that it didn't really do much to distinguish itself from just a long episode, but I feel the significant change of setting to London did enough for that.  Either way, for fans of K-On only, but that should have been fairly apparent from the off.",™

With exception of higher thermal mass (which would make them slower) what would prevent electrical power reactors from doing the same?  Answer: nothing except for the fact that this is uneconomical where nuclear energy has the lowest base load marginal cost. Where majority of electrical energy is produced by nuclear reactors, they as expected, run in load-following mode.

Cleaner factories, more fuel efficient vehicles and less environmentally harmful production techniques are real, and should really be supported. Indeed there is not downside to improving the air and environment When marketers caught on that people would buy one product over another when it was advertised as green though, a lot of things that really aren't all that good environmentally became Green™.  There really isn't much of a reason to buy green dish soap, recycled toilet paper and all these products that stick an environmentally friendly logo on them.  It's just another form of advertising.  There is actually some worry recently as biodegradable microprocessors became a real possibility which could lead to a whole new type of planned obsolescence veiled in environmental friendless.

In addition to seeking the Lord, I would encourage you to seek out a Bible believing church that you can hook up with (if you haven't already) and possibly a guy friend you respect to speak into your life, a mentor if you will. If your church has small groups, this is a great way to build friendships and do life with others who are pursuing God. It also is a great way to have accountability and have other godly people encourage and support you and pray for you. I love what  Romans 8:28 says: 28 That's why we can be so sure that every detail in our lives of love for God is worked into something good.

t5_2sq2y,bryf50,1350969335,"It isn't even true that AMD is no longer giving driver updates to the 4000 cards. They simply branched the drivers because there was no more major updating to be done for them. Even if these latest drivers were available to you they would off 0 performance increase. &gt;AMD will be moving the AMD Radeon™ HD 2000, AMD Radeon HD 3000, and AMD Radeon HD 4000 Series of products to a new driver support model.  We will continue to support the mentioned products in our Catalyst releases, but we’re moving their updates to a quarterly basis, whereas our AMD Radeon HD 5000 and later products will continue to see monthly updates. The Quarterly Catalyst releases will focus on resolving application specific issues and critical updates. The reason for the shift in support policy is largely due to the fact that the AMD Radeon HD 2000, AMD Radeon HD 3000, and AMD Radeon HD 4000 Series have been optimized to their maximum potential from a performance and feature perspective. The 8.97 based driver, released in May 2012 will be the first driver for the AMD Radeon HD 2000, AMD Radeon HD 3000, and AMD Radeon HD 4000 Series under the new support model; it is an extremely stable and robust driver branch for these products and will be the baseline for our quarterly updates.",™
t5_2qh1i,My_Post_Is_On_Topic,1350970469,"Woah, I just realized how incredibly awesome your site would be for really attractive women, I didn't even think of that. They'd see if they could get a real connection before revealing their pic to the guy, and that way they'd know the guy wasn't just in it for looks.  However, reversely, attractive women have little issue attracting guys on dating sites, and thus wouldn't need a filter like Masquerade since they could just have a conversation with a guy anyway and see if they connect.  Most human beings care about both looks and personality. You're looking for a specific forum to market to, yet there is none. Almost the entire world falls into your demographic - mature people who want a meaningful relationship.  I highly advise creating a speed-dating Omegle version of OkCupid, and simply inputting your no-pics idea as an option. This way, that attractive girl who wants a guy that doesn't care about her looks can check the box that says ""match me only with users using the realconnection™ method (pics and profiles reveal upon both users opting to share.)"" The hook would be an awesome Omegle/Okcupid hybrid, and the realconnection™ option would be the main feature of your site - connecting users based on conversational compatability, not pictures or profiles. But the important thing is that users can choose whether or not they want that.  Also, the reason I typed so much is that I've used OkCupid, POF, and Blendr and am still looking into dating sites and how to use them most effectively. Your site would do most of the work for the user, which is PERFECT. Instead of me sending ten messages a day and getting back hopefully one reply, I could get a reply instantly.  Despite all the intense criticism I gave you, your idea is brilliant.",™

But when I read the title, I was hoping for a rap: I'm an old-school atheist and I'm here to say, As you flock to /r/atheism, I yell ""Hooray!"" I've been doing this ish since before it was cool, So let me take a quick moment to take y'all to school. Disbelieving in god ain't always the easiest, But those fundie mothafuckas is truly the sleaziest. It ain't always easy, but it's definitely worth it, Because /r/atheism, you're truly the shit. Yo, if you believe in Islam I'm here to tell you, sorry, you're wrong. I know you think that Allah is the bomb, But mostly you're deluded misogynist dongs. And for all of you there who are my Christian bros, Messin' with your 12-year old alter boy ""hos,"" We're here to say your beliefs are whack There ain't no god and your pope's a quack. And finally, that brings me to my friends, the Jews. Please don't think we forgot about you. Don't believe that since you been around a little longer, That your ideas on Yahweh ain't wronger. World-wide floods? Partin seas? A talking bush? Sounds like OG stoners been smoking the kush. So the next time you're debating getting on your knees, /R/atheism is here to beg you, please, Try today, to just think for yourself. It's good for the world, and it's good for your health.

t5_2s30g,timsstuff,1350974923,"Let me tell you about the Triangle of Perfection™ (I invented it). As I'm sure you're aware (hopefully), a triangle has 3 points that are all connected. There is physical beauty, intelligence, and personality. Obviously most of these are pretty subjective, and you don't have to be a 10 in all three in order to achieve the the ""perfect"" ratio, just have to be within my range of acceptability. Unfortunately, most girls are 2 out of 3.   There's the girl who is hot, smart, but she's a bitch. Probably too smart for her own good and hasn't learned humility and how to not flaunt her two good features.   Then there's the one who is hot, super cool, but dumb as a rock. I'll take that one over the hot smart bitch, but still not ideal.   Then there's the girl who is smart, super cool, but just not attractive. Maybe that can be fixed, maybe not. I can't be with someone I'm not physically attracted to. Shallow? Maybe. Reality? Definitely.  Then there's those unfortunate individuals who only have maybe one out of three...the hot stupid bitch, the really nice dumb ugly girl, and the smart ugly bitch. No, no, and double no.  But every once in a while you run into a girl who is not only very attractive but also smart, and has a wonderful personality. That is the Triangle of Perfection and it is all too rare, at least in the single world and in my particular area.   But no, being smart is absolutely not a turn off, unless you're a bitch about it and think you're smarter than everyone else. I come across people like that once in a while and it's pretty funny. It's like they have something to prove, some kind if inadequacy that they need to overcompensate for. It's kind of sad really because if they could just chill out and not do that, they might actually have a good time and make friends. People of average intelligence are highly aware when a ""smart"" person is trying too hard to show how ""smart"" they are and it's extremely off-putting. ",™

t5_2qi3y,randonymous,1351021425,"The law is very poorly written.  Mostly because it does not address the science.  I wrote a post earlier about this, but California is the king of good intentions gone bad.  If you want a good law, make the genes look like ingredients.  For example:    ""Genes known to differ from wild-type plants:  * Vitamin B Synthase * Protexion™ (Roundup-resistance) * HSP456 (Frost-resistance) * ClatherinIIa (Inhibits pollen formation)""    Sticking a 'GMO' label means nothing because everything is modified - by nature, by accident, or by guided or designed accident.  UV light 'modifies' genes.  It is a bad law written with good intentions.  It will only further diseducate the electorate and make them fearful of something they could and should actually have a hand in deciding.  I would really like to write up some text for a scientifically accurate law.  With regards to environmental impact - unfortunately this law again will do nothing.  Certain modifications considered 'GMO' under this law would be impossible to have an environmental impact.  While others which skirt the GMO label because they were 'found' mutations (after you irradiated a billion seeds for 2 years...) could be quite deleterious if released into the wild.  With regards to health - a gene is simply a recipe for a protein.  It is exceedingly unlikely that a point mutation, or even a gene insertion or deletion could make something 'unhealthy' for us to eat.  Honestly, the converse is a much more powerful argument - Corn didn't design itself to be nutritious for mammals to eat - how would that benefit its natural selection?  The vitamins we need to survive, and the ratio of good nutrients to bad for mammals is not something a plant will naturally select itself to produce.  Supplementing corn with vitamins (which from the corn's perspective is an evolutionary burden) is actually something we probably would be right in doing.   At the end of the day, eat variety and eat in moderation.  Educate yourself about what these genes are and what they do.  Don't be emotionally led by the concept of a ""genetic modification"".",™

In addition to these two add-on content packs, the Elite Soldier Pack, which was free to those who pre-ordered XCOM: Enemy Unknown or purchased the game at launch, is now available for purchase. XCOM: Enemy Unknown has critics raving, including review scores of 9 out of 10 from PlayStation: The Official Magazine, 9.1 out of 10 from GameTrailers.com, and 9.5 out of 10 from Game Informer, earning ""Game of the Month"" honors in the November 2012 issue.  The Slingshot Content Pack, the first of two add-on content packs for XCOM: Enemy Unknown, will be available soon. In this new set of linked Council missions, gamers will meet an enigmatic Triad operative, divert an alien ship's course, and do battle with the aliens in the skies over China. The Slingshot Content Pack includes three new maps tied to the Council missions, a new playable squad character with a unique story and voice and new character customization options. The release date and pricing of the Slingshot Content Pack will be announced soon.  The Elite Soldier Pack, originally free for those who pre-ordered XCOM: Enemy Unknown or purchased the game at launch, is now available for purchase for $4.99 (PlayStation®Network) / 400 Microsoft Points (Xbox LIVE® online entertainment network) / $4.99 (Windows PC). The Elite Soldier Pack provides the ultimate tools for soldier customization in XCOM: Enemy Unknown, including:  * Classic X-COM soldier: Players will instantly receive a new recruit in their barracks inspired by the original X-COM: UFO Defense. The iconic soldier with the blonde, flattop hairstyle will return fully modernized. ￼ * Soldier Deco packs: Players can customize their soldier with several aesthetic upgrades to armor suits, including the new Hyperion and Reaper soldier armor kits.  * Complete color customization: A variety of colors and tints for all armor sets in the game allow players complete control to customize their squad's look.  A free playable demo* of XCOM: Enemy Unknown is available globally for Windows PC via Steam, and for Xbox 360 and PS3TM. Gamers who download the demo will be guided through two levels of the single- player tutorial campaign, experiencing the combat controls and effective tactics for defending humanity against the alien threat. The two tutorial missions will also introduce players to the XCOM base, where soldier training and researching alien technology takes place, and offers a chance to experience the tactical and strategic layers of XCOM: Enemy Unknown.  Released in 1993, the original X-COM still reigns as one of the best PC games of all time and has been reimagined as XCOM: Enemy Unknown by the strategy experts at Firaxis Games. XCOM: Enemy Unknown expands on the X-COM legacy with an entirely new story, enemies and technologies to fight hostile aliens and defend Earth. In XCOM: Enemy Unknown, players will oversee combat strategies and individual unit tactics as well as base management and resource allocation while playing as the commander of a secret global military organization, XCOM. With equal emphasis on deep strategy and intense tactical combat, XCOM: Enemy Unknown will allow gamers to control the fate of the human race by defending against a terrifying global alien invasion.

The first claimed detection of mammalian endogenous DMT was published in June 1965: German researchers F. Franzen and H. Gross report to have evidenced and quantified DMT, along with its structural analog bufotenin (5-OH-DMT), in human blood and urine.[42] In an article published four months later, the method used in their study is strongly criticized, and credibility of their results challenged.[43]  In 2001, surveys, made in research articles, point that few of the analytical methods previously used to measure levels of endogenously formed DMT had enough sensitivity and selectivity to produce reliable results.[44][45] Gas chromatography, preferably coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS), is considered a minimum requirement.[45] A study published in 2005[28] implements the most sensitive and selective method ever used to measure endogenous DMT:[46] liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry with electrospray ionization (LC-ESI-MS/MS) allows to reach limits of detection (LODs) 12 to 200 fold lower (that is, better) than those attained by the best methods employed in the 1970s. The data summarized in the table below are from studies conforming to the abovementioned requirements (abbreviations used: CSF = cerebrospinal fluid; LOD = limit of detection; n = number of samples; ng/L and ng/kg = nanograms (10−9 g) per litre, and nanograms per kilogram, respectively): DMT in body fluids and tissues (NB: units have been harmonized) Species 	Sample 	Results Human 	Blood serum 	&lt; LOD (n = 66)[28] Blood plasma 	&lt; LOD (n = 71)[28]  ♦  &lt; LOD (n = 38); 1,000 &amp; 10,600 ng/L (n = 2)[47] Whole blood 	&lt; LOD (n = 20); 50–790 ng/L (n = 20)[48] Urine 	&lt; 100 ng/L (n = 9)[28]  ♦  &lt; LOD (n = 60); 160–540 ng/L (n = 5)[45]  ♦  Detected in n = 10 by GC-MS[49] Feces 	&lt; 50 ng/kg (n = 12); 130 ng/kg (n = 1)[28] Kidney 	15 ng/kg (n = 1)[28] Lung 	14 ng/kg (n = 1)[28] Lumbar CSF 	100,370 ng/L (n = 1); 2,330–7,210 ng/L (n = 3); 350 &amp; 850 ng/L (n = 2)[50] Rat 	Kidney 	12 &amp;16 ng/kg (n = 2)[28] Lung 	22 &amp; 12 ng/kg (n = 2)[28] Liver 	6 &amp; 10 ng/kg (n = 2)[28] Brain 	10 &amp;15 ng/kg (n = 2)[28]  ♦  Measured in synaptic vesicular fraction[51] Rabbit 	Liver 	&lt; 10 ng/kg (n = 1)[28]",♦

t5_2qnwb,spook86,1351066424,"All psychotropic medications do is disrupt the frequency at which neurons using that particular affected receptor use. There are also feedback mechanisms (a lot) in those pathways, in your case dopamine stimulants trigger the uncoupling (deletion) of dopamine receptors. This is going to disrupt information processing in the brain, and will produce withdrawal symptoms and dependency syndromes which will transiently cause psychiatric and neurological problems. Not everyone experiences these symptoms, but most people will and usually will not understand what's happening.

All doctors and psychiatrists should know what Medline is, even if they don't know it's online. http://ncbi.nih.gov/pubmed (also http://pubmed.org auto redirects)  *Please note most of what is published in psychiatry and pharmacology is not scientifically useful, or are ghost written or may simply be misleading. Eliminate articles that do not actually perform an experiment themselves where possible to reduce this - remember observations must be measured with an instrument, not a written test or something purely subjective.

When they entered their field themselves after graduating they found this was not the case. Namely there were no diagnostic tests, and there never will be because the basic science required to determine the what made someone with severe mental illness different from normal person never happened. The diagnostic tools are basically a book for of subjective 'symptoms', and there are two books, the ICDM (the rest of the world uses) and the DSM (America only). THe ICD-10 (the current version) does not recognize ADD or ADHD. As far as clinical trials for drugs went.. well they look like this: http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/news/content/article/10168/2054470 While that's a long confusing boring article, it says that out of 10,000 clinical trials there were 2,194 symptom rating scale systems for used. That means that a single symptom was interpreted in over 2,000 different ways. In other words, science does not allow us to measure something that cannot be reproduced in a repeatable way, like thermometer reading. The implication of having no standardized rating system (because it all subjective conjecture) means this is not science, this is pseudoscience. If you question anything your psychiatrist does, he's not going to have an answer unless hes fabricating it to make you more receptive to taking medicine that he thinks will help you. Why is Amphetamine, methamphetamine, and methlythenidate approved for illness that can't really be substantiated? Well, the world is driven by the most money the fastest, and i'm sorry that humans are shallow :(. http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-peter-breggin/psychiatric-drugs_b_1693649.html  I'm letting you know of all this because add and adhd medications lose their efficiency completely after 1 year of use (search the term 'long term use' on medline). Psychiatry is basically a pseudoscience, your parents probably never knew this, and that's why they won't take you off a pill that makes your gums bleed. i can only suggest you show them something like this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG1VHpsgUcY  I'm sorry you haven't been allowed to discontinue this drug.",®

Which is similar to how you login to your 'gamertag' to access GFWL/XBL, or your PSN ID to access PSN play.  If you need evidence here's a quote from the article which refers to an EA privacy policy document:  &gt; ""... wishing to play EA titles **online** will need a Origin **account** to do so""  There's no mention of the Origin client which means it's your Origin ID. There is only mention of needing it for **online** play, which is common for just about EVERY game today (if you want to play multiplayer on PC/Xbox/PS3 you NEED to login to SOMETHING).  Here's a direct quote from EA's [official document](http://www.ea.com/privacy-policy)  &gt; V.    Information Provided To EA By Third Parties.  &gt; EA also obtains personal and non-personal information from third parties as discussed below.  EA only uses this data for purposes consistent with this policy.  &gt; 1. PlayStation®3 System  &gt; If you sign up to play EA games through a PlayStation®3 system, **your Sony Entertainment Network account information will be provided to EA so that we can establish an Origin Account for you**. You **need an Origin Account to play EA's titles online.** By signing up to play EA's titles, you agree that limited user account information can be transferred to EA. Information transferred to EA includes your name, email address, online ID, country, language and date of birth but does not include credit card number or other financial account information.  &gt; 2. Xbox LIVE  &gt; If you sign up to play EA games through Microsoft's Xbox LIVE Service, **Microsoft will provide your Xbox LIVE user account information to EA so that we can establish an Origin Account for you.** You **need an Origin Account to play EA's Xbox LIVE titles.** By signing up to play EA's Xbox LIVE titles, you agree that Microsoft can transfer your user account information to EA. Information transferred from Microsoft to EA includes your Gamertag, email address, state or province, country, language and age but does not include credit card number or other financial account information.  &gt; 3. Wii U  &gt; If you sign up to play EA games through a Nintendo Wii U console, your **Nintendo account information will be provided to EA so that we can establish an Origin Account for you.** You **need an Origin Account to play EA’s titles online.** By signing up to play EA’s titles, you agree that limited user account information can be transferred to EA. Information transferred to EA includes your Mii information, email address, Nintendo Network ID, friend list, country, language and date of birth but does not include credit card number or other financial account information.   So here's my question to you: if the fact that to play EA games online on the WiiU will require you to have an Origin account creates less impetus to purchase the system, does this also reduce the impetus to purchase from Sony and Microsoft as well? Or do you just dislike EA? At the moment it just seems like this is an unreasonable excuse to circlejerk over how much you dislike EA. You can dislike them all you want, but you can't say ""I'm definitely not buying the WiiU now because it has Origin"" as the statement is misleading (i.e. only your Origin ID is required for ONLINE play) and because Origin accounts are on all systems with EA games at the moment. Will you now trade in your Xbox or PS3? You could just avoid buying EA games and still get a WiiU. I just think this is an excuse for you to circlejerk while simultaneously giving an actually valid reason as to why you won't *really* be purchasing the WiiU (i.e. region-locking).",®

t5_2qhta,ticklesmypickle,1351071479,"These crystals are a result of your cat not getting enough water to flush the waste out of their body. Indoor cats are more prone to this because they usually eat kibble which doesn't contain the amount of water that, say, a mouse would contain. This is why some people feed their cats wet food. Sometimes cats are ""kibble addicts"", though and will refuse to eat anything but their dry food. If this is the case (as it was with my cat) or the problem persists, then you can give your cat a veterinary diet food designed to up your cat's water intake by raising the incentive to drink by including more magnesium and sodium than regular cat food. I use [UR Urinary St/Ox® Feline Formula](http://www.purinaveterinarydiets.com/Product/URUrinaryStOxCatFood.aspx) which my cat actually loves. It is expensive so I began my cat out at 100% of the Purina stuff for a couple of months to get rid of the crystals and then after I knew that the problem was not coming back I began to slowly mix the Purina with another over the counter, (meaning you can buy it at the store) urinary tract food that was cheaper. Eventually I got my cat at a 50/50 mix of the two. I found that the infections didn't recur if I fed her this and always had fresh water available for her. I have read that having a moving water fountain also provides incentive to drink as well. You can maybe find that food online or your vet can special order it for you. It runs around $50 a 16lb bag. My 10 lb cat gets 1, 1/2 cup scoop, twice a day with two 1/4 cup snacks periodically as well, and she goes through about 3-4 bags a year of the vet diet and the same of the over the counter stuff. If you don't want to buy an over the counter urinary diet to mix with the vet stuff, I suggest using a dry food that has a high moisture content that has meat listed as the first ingredient. Too many pet foods are cut with bone meal and nutrition-less fillers like wheat. Do cats eat wheat out in the wild? No.   I hope this helps you out. I learned all of this through a couple months of research, trial and error with my 3 year old baby and many trips to the vet. It sucked watching her suffer all the while and she also killed all the house plants in the process (she would squat and try to pee but she couldn't but eventually could and when she did, she peed in the plants). Good luck!",®

t5_2r9po,Acromir,1351105696,"I've seen builds like that before, although I can honestly never say I've seen it combined with a signet build. *Very* interesting. That said, here's my 100% honest opinion on that:  First off, let's look at the weapon set. I like the ability to close offered by Shadow Shot, but I'm rather skeptical about everything else.  Black Powder is a highly powerful defensive ability *if* you're either standing in it and firing projectiles or you can keep the enemy standing in it. It seems like your build does neither of those things, opting to lay it down for a simple blind and then leap for stealth. This makes it weak given the 6♦ cost.  Likewise, staying in melee will be hard. You have a shadowstep that you can use frequently, but then you have to *stay* in melee range to hit them with your dagger. Without any cripples or immobilizes, you're going to be using Shadow Shot often.  I'm skeptical about the damage this build can put out. Dagger's auto-attack is actually weaker than pistol and equal to sword. The true power of dagger in terms of DPS is in backstab. This build makes it exceedingly expensive to go into stealth (9♦), whereas a d/d build could enter stealth for less than half that cost. Cloak and Dagger also does as much damage as Black Powder -&gt; Heartseeker (over 25%), and in half the time. Heartseeker is decent damage, but only really worth using if your opponent is under 25% health.  I'm not a huge fan of Signet of Malice for this build. Rule of thumb: in order for SoM's passive to heal you for more than Hide in Shadows, you have to get off two attacks every second. This means either skills with rapid attacks or consistent AoE. For  D/P or P/P, SoM is great. It also works well with a shortbow or S/P if you're doing consistent AoE damage. If you're using SoM on cooldown for the active heal, you're healing for 20% more than HiS but you have to deal with the huge (and easily interrutped) cast-time and you don't get the stealth or condition removal.  You do have good mobility with the Shortbow and tons of initiative, but you have only one stun-break. Additionally, your build relies on using signets frequently, but in order for you to escape you need both Signet of Shadows (for the run speed) and Infiltrator's Signet (for the stun break). You'll also have a hard time disengaging by using Shadow Refuge (because it breaks stealth when you leave it), although you can use it to stay hidden once you break LoS.  ...  So there you go. Sorry if I came off as brutal, but that's my honest opinion. I just think that for a roaming WvW build, this is lacking in control abilities and escapes. I'm starting to think that any good roaming build needs a dagger offhand, because having that readily available stealth is just too good.  Nonetheless, I'm far from the Arena-Net official authority on all things thief. The most important thing is whether or not this build works for you. I couldn't make it work for me, but if it fits your style then by all means keep using it.",♦

t5_2r9po,Acromir,1351108960,"&gt;I actually don't use the Shadow Shot at all. Black Powder + Heartseeker (combo stealth) may be 3 initiative more expensive and do less damage overall, but it comes with a smoke field (already quite powerful on its own), a blind and a gap closer with Heartseeker (so I can stay in melee range easily). The best part is that I don't need to be in melee range or hit anything to enter stealth.  Does this give you the 2♦ from entering stealth? I was under the impression that didn't work if you stealth from combos. I thought that it had to be from a skill you use. The wording is ""Gain 2♦ when using a skill that stealths you."" If that trait applies, then I'll agree that your method has its merits. However, without it, you could CnD -&gt; Backstab twice as often with D/D.  &gt;It removes immobilize and chill  It does? How?  &gt;Shadow Refuge no longer breaks stealth when you leave it, after the Halloween patch.  Really? AWESOME! I was really busy yesterday, and all of my time on the computer was spent converting/editing/uploading this video. In that case, Shadow Refuge is epic.  &gt;I use Signet of Malice because of its extremely short cool-down, its utility during Dagger Storm, Cluster Bomb, and dagger auto-attacks. If Signet of Malice is on cool-down, I still have my healing from Stealth.  Fair enough. SoM is amazing for AoE fights, and combining it with Dagger Storm gives you god mode for 8 seconds. I guess it does also work well with your signet build, although I hate the long activation time. If it works for you, keep it. I've just personally never found it to be as good when I'm not AoE-bombing.  &gt;I have strayed away from main-hand Sword because it lacks the sheer damage output of Heartseeker spam and Backstab.  Completely agreed. Just some info on this, from testing/math I've done:  Sword and Dagger's auto-attack does the same damage (Dagger is ~1% more, but that's inconsequential). However, Sword is AoE and applies cripple/weakness. Dagger's Heartseeker is good single-target burst on an opponent under 50% health. Sword/Dagger has equivalent AoE burst with Dancing Dagger, which does surprisingly good damage in AoE.  D/D's true damage comes from CnD -&gt; Backstab. If we compare CnD -&gt; Backstab with S/D's CnD -&gt; Tactical Strike, D/D does 48% more damage from the back or equal damage from the front. However, Tactical Strike blinds from the front and dazes for 2s from the back. If you compare CnD -&gt; Backstab with Cnd -&gt; Tactical Strike -&gt; 2 autoattacks, S/D does equal damage to D/D.   Diffn't strokes fer diffn't folks.",♦

Simply getting hit on should not make any reasonable person uncomfortable. It's normal for people--especially younger people like these--to hit on each other at any time of the day.

I'm not going to pretend that I know what someone's true intentions were.  She got hit on and acted like a nutcase. She deserves the sarcasm.  I'll tell you the other reason she deserves the sarcasm: she's just another piece of shit who's co-opting atheism to promote herself and get attention. So some atheists are sexist assholes.

View Full Glossary  Glossary CARFAX Price Adjustment™ Accidents, service records, number of owners and many other history factors can affect a vehicle's value. The CARFAX Price Adjustment is a tool that analyzes millions of used car transactions to measure how the combination of all the information reported to CARFAX affects the value of a particular vehicle. The vehicle's retail book value plus the CARFAX Price Adjustment will give you a more accurate measure of the vehicle's value. Use this tool, along with a vehicle inspection and test drive, to make a better decision about your next used car. New Owner Reported When a vehicle is sold to a new owner, the Title must be transferred to the new owner(s) at a Department of Motor Vehicles. Ownership History CARFAX defines an owner as an individual or business that possesses and uses a vehicle. Not all title transactions represent changes in ownership. To provide estimated number of owners, CARFAX proprietary technology analyzes all the events in a vehicle history. Estimated ownership is available for vehicles manufactured after 1994 and titled solely in the US including Puerto Rico. Dealers sometimes opt to take ownership of a vehicle and are required to in the following states: Maine, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania and South Dakota. Please consider this as you review a vehicle's estimated ownership history. Title Issued A state issues a title to provide a vehicle owner with proof of ownership. Each title has a unique number. Each title or registration record on a CARFAX report does not necessarily indicate a change in ownership. In Canada, a registration and bill of sale are used as proof of ownership.

t5_2rc6i,Fishtails,1351187166,"Typed on my phone, I'll try and correct strange mis-typed errors as I see them.   Here's what I do, it may seem like a task but it really takes up but to change 25 gallons out of my 90 gallon takes no more than 10 minutes. Longer if I algae scrub first.  * step 1 is an ongoing process.  I have my RO/DI set up in the garage, which makes about 30 gallons of water per day.  I just leave it running during the week and it fills up a big 40 gallon rubbermaid bin in the garage.  In the bin I leave a pump with 5 or so feet of hose attached to it, more on that later.  I rinse and sterilize the bin every month or so with a light bleach solution.  * I also have a half dozen 5 gallon jugs, the kind you refill at the grocery store (which is often a pretty good place to get RO water in a pinch, most machines are serviced regularly) .  When I have enough water (which I can tell by scratch mark lines I put in the rubbermaid at 5 gallon intervals), I turn off the RO and move to the next step.  * I use the jugs because it makes it much easier for me to measure exactly how much water I replace.  I know that the salt I use is 2^1/2 cups of salt per 5 gallons, so I have a glass that holds the exact amount, and a funnel.  Put a scoop in each jug, takes about a minute, salt measured.  Take those salty jugs to the garage!  * plug in the water pump sitting in the RO water, hose in jug, fill.  Now you have however much measured saltwater you want.  I often just make 30 gallons and leave them for whenever.  Plan ahead, do this step in your spare time.  * water change day.  Now that we have saltwater laying around for use whenever, let's change some water.  Just before the change is a great time to feed the fish, if you want.  Now turn off all return pumps and powerheads, this is also the best time to algae scrub if you need to.  * **Highly recommended important step.**  have one jug specifically as a ""garbage jug."" I have black market on mine that clearly says ""NOT 4 FISH.""  This is the one that you siphon water from the tank into, I just use a basic 3/4"" vinyl hose to siphon. Old school style, I start the siphon with my mouth, no f&amp;@©s given.  *  90g tank, let's say I want to change 25g, I siphon out 5 jugs worth, while watching TV.  I like the 3/4"" hose because it's just fast enough of a siphon where sucking out 5 jugs worth takes about 10 minutes, that includes the time it takes me to dump the garbage jug out.  I usually graze over the surface of the sand and remove all the detritus I can find.  Using a turkey baster to blast stuff out from the rock crevices is useful to maximize crap removal, just make sure all flow is turned off.  Just one at a time, fill a jug, dump it. Pay attention not to overflow jug onto the floor.  * now that the water is out, time to refill.  Here's how I personally like to do it.  I briefly turn the return pump back on to push water out of the sump back into the tank. Then I set my first jug of clean saltwater on the table next to the tank. The table is higher than the sump, so I just insert my hose into the clean water, and siphon it into the sump, one at a time.  Once the water is all swapped, turn the flow back on, done.  Be sure and rinse the salty jugs with fresh water.",©

(I honestly don't know how to make sure that I am not being read in a sarcastic tone - I am being serious - I appreciate this.)  I go on win streaks when I am playing well and making shit up, and I go on losing streaks when i am playing poorly. (Which then typically leads me to go on full tilt and be a dick to everyone who is around me - I am sorry for this last week).  To be honest there are two ways to not get stuck like me. You can either learn actual builds and make correct reads based on what the opponent can be doing (don't try to pin them on a strat - eliminate possibilities)  while macro'ing well. The other is to have really great game sense and just wing it every game but have amazing micro mechanics so that you can win fights that you shouldn't be able to win while macro'ing fairly well. (The third option is still viable as well - just all in every game, but you won't really get better you will just get wins).   MacroJackson here is some ♥ and upvotes for you! :)",♥

I submitted a photo of my Roronoa Zoro earrings 28 days ago and have received nothing but nice and supportive comments. If it weren't for the masses of you asking me to please-make-them-for-you-too, I wouldn't have gone ahead and actually created an online store.  It was a long road, which included many loopholes to jump through to get everything up and running. A long road that was totally worth it. I created, you criticised, and I improved. What is left over now is a budding passion for One Piece and jewellery creating and a little of extra money I can make on the side, which in turn allows me to enjoy life just a little more. And who's to thank for that? Well, mostly *you*, Reddit. So honestly, from the bottom of my heart, thank you for your support, criticism and purchases! Thank you!  What else can I do than to return the favour, and how better to do so than in the form of a discount coupon? I really want to see you guys in my earrings, with or without the costume/cosplay, with or without the One Piece reference. I want to share my creations with you.  ###&gt;☠&lt; *Where do I go to use the coupon?*  http://lydocia.etsy.com  ###&gt;☠&lt; *How long will it be active?*  Until the 31st of October, 2012.  ###&gt;☠&lt; *Will they reach me in time?*  I'll admit, it's a bit of a gamble, but I haven't been able to put up this offer sooner, so my sincerest apologies for that. According to the post office, the package will arrive within the week, so if you order now and I can ship tomorrow, chances are they'll be there in time for the 31st. And if not... Well, at least you enjoyed a discount and have your spiffy Zoro earrings for casual wearing, for cosplay or for next year's Halloween! ",☠

t5_2qh1s,quelar,1351204129,"Ok, I'll step back here and explain a little.  When I say market forces I'm not talking about the long running market forces that are natural functions of a society, what I'm more referring to is  Market Forces™  that gets shoved down our throats by conservatives, corporations, and the ""free market"" advocates who have nothing but their own interests in mind.  I'd be very happy to see market forces at work, but our global economy is so screwed up that true market forces are completely undermined by the trade agreements, monopolies, government involvement, and stock market manipulation that it's not valuable talking about market forces happening in any natural sense in our economy.  So to answer your other question, yes.   When it comes to something I absolutely NEED to survive I would prefer that the pricing is in the control of people that can be somewhat controlled (through popular opinion) and the money going back into the general coffers rather than in the hands of corporations that don't care about the end users, only shareholders, and the money could be going anywhere.  It's been tried before, the best example was [Bolivia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_privatization_in_Bolivia).  The idea was the same as letting the free market clean up the water system for some profit, the end result was a crushing betrayal of the people who ended up violently opposing the situation.  ",™

t5_2qh2p,dragnier,1351220803,"Biologist here.  Just wanted to point out that the definitions of scales of evolution (micro v macro) are from creation apologist arguments which try to resolve the observed evolution (such adaptations of viruses and bacteria, or even larger things such as domestications of animals) as a different thing than the evolution which gives rise to speciation which they claim doesn't have sufficient evidence for since it comes from the nefarious, and devil placed, fossil records.   Logically it goes like this:  IN REALITY  &gt;**A** = heredity of genetic adaptation  &gt;**B** = speciation  &gt;**C** = evolution  Biology claims (based on thousands of lifetimes of academic research) that:  &gt;**A↔C**  &gt;and  &gt;**B↔C**  (those jerks) &gt; ∴ **A↔B↔C** meaning if one is true they are all true (really A and B are just different consequences of C)  The creationists now have a problem because now that A can be directly observed, it cannot be denied (as easily, boy do they try though). So these apologists try to split the definitions something like this:   &gt;**A** = heredity of genetic adaptation  &gt;**B** = speciation  &gt;***C*** = Micro evolution  &gt;***D*** = Macro evolution  Then creationists claim:  &gt;**A↔*****C***  &gt;and  &gt;**B↔*****D***  This is to remove any causal link between what we can literally point to, alive, in a lab, versus what we have to point to in a fossil record leaving them with the argument of   &gt;""you can't show me therefor you're wrong"".   Of course, you have shown them, they just redefined it to something else.   Unfortunately most atheists are not biologists, (though almost all biologists are atheists) and ""atheist apologists"" who will defend criticism like yours without understanding what they are saying. Mostly they are tripped up by trying to work within your framework assuming you have correct knowledge. For examples just look to the replies to your comment defending the original post which don't elucidate on the flawed claim of macro v micro.",↔

t5_2qplv,iswm,1351234741,"I think you're getting caught up in semantics. My point was that quantum physics requires the concept of an observer for it to work. The foundation of quantum physics is that everything exists in a quantum state, which is a superposition of all it's possibile states. When something is observed, it collapses into something concrete. So the question becomes ""who (or what) is the observer?"", which is a good question indeed. It's consciousness, intelligence, god, the singularity, whatever you want to call it.  As far as sacred geometry being pseudo science.. I guess it depends on what you mean by sacred geometry. I've certainly heard lots of pseudoscientific stuff about the power of mandalas and the like, but that's not what I think of when I think of sacred geometry. I think of a very simple, naturally emergent algorithm that describes how to derive all of nature's underlying geometry. From it you can derive all the platonic solids (giving you geometry, physical object properties) and other special numbers like pi (circles -&gt; calculus, waves), phi (fibonacci sequence, fractals, natural biological proportions), and the square roots of 2, 3 and 5 (triangles -&gt; trigonometry). These are the very fundamentals of all our mathematics! It also describes how it is possible to encode an infinite amount of data into a single point, or holographic information storage! Fractals! That is deeply profound, and none of it is pseudoscience.  So I guess the problem is that people think of newage hippy-dippy stuff, which is a shame, because mathematically, sacred geometry is absolutely fascinating and the rules it describes absolutely do manifest everywhere in the world around us. From the angles of bonds in molecules, to the shape of the probability fields of electrons in atoms, the formation of crystals (snowflakes! rocks!), the placement and spacing on leaves on a branch and petals on a flower, the proportions of the human body, and to the shape of galaxies.   In fact, the most accepted candidate for The Theory Of Everything™ in theoretical physics right now is The Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model which depends on both the concept of an observer (to collapse the symmetry by observing it) and a holographic universe having the same properties that sacred geometry describes. A field from which things can manifest by being observed. Again, this is mainstream academic theoretical physics, and calling it pseudoscience would be rather dismissive.  Anyway, I hope this doesn't come off as argumentative, since I didn't intend it to be. I just think sacred geometry is super interesting and I wish people knew that there is so much more to it than pretty pictures and healing mandalas.  What's in a name anyway? :)",™

t5_2rjuw,neorean,1351272848,"I have a suggestion, I think it would be more useful to organise the groups by the tracker they are affiliated with rather than alphabetically.  Firstly, this means that the 'URL' entry is not required so it's easier and saves space.  It's also more useful being able to easily see how many internal groups any certain tracker has and what those groups are.  And finally you could have an 'undetermined' category at the bottom of the list with all the submissions where the person didn't know/put what site they are with. This would make it a lot easier for people to see what entries are missing their assigned tracker and contribute that information if they have it.

t5_2smhl,_wolfram,1351279881,"Taking Veigar to have 800 AP, ~100 Baleful Strike stacks, the game time to be about at the 40-45 min, and an inner turret as the target:  * Wth a stacked Guinsoo's Rageblade you will end up with 800 + (8 * 6 * 1.35[RDC and 4/4 Archmage mastery]) = **864.8 AP**.  * Pushing turrets with Veigar means you're dealing around 95.55+(864.8 * 0.4) = 441.47 turret-effective AD. You're only doing 100/180 of that (the turret will have 80 armour after minion reduction) when attacking turrets in the presence of minions so actually the net damage is 441.47 * 100/180 = **245.2611 turret-effective AD**.  * Your attack speed at max Guinsoo stacks is **1.077 /s**, so your turret DPS is 245.2611 * 1.077 = **264.1462 AD/s**.  * A full HP turret has 2550 HP so you would need 2550/264.1462 = **~9.7 seconds to take down a turret with Veigar**. It would take him ceiling(2550 / 245.2611) = ceiling(10.029) = **11 hits** to take down the turret and **no mana is consumed**.  * Total build cost: **13045g**  Now let's compare that with a typical Jax build:  * A level 18 Jax will have 117.05+40+30+35+3 = 225.05 AD assuming a Hextech Gunblade, Trinity Force, stacked Guinsoo's Rageblade and a 3/3 Brute Force mastery. Net damage on a turret will be 225.05 * 100/180 = **125.03 AD**.  * He will have **1.53 /s** attack speed with the above items and 4/4 Alacrity mastery, meaning 1/1.53 = **0.6546 s** intervals between each attack.  * A Sheen proc will deal total 125.03 + (117.05 * 1.5) = 300.755. Net damage on a turret will be 300.755 * 100/180 = **167.09 AD for Sheen proc**.  * Starting with a Sheen proc (⚔), and taking into mind the cooldowns of rank 5 abilities (off cooldown: ✓), the cumulative damage will result as follows:      1)    167.09     @ 0.0000 s     ⚔ W            ○●○○     2)    292.12     @ 0.6546 s     3)    417.15     @ 1.3092 s     4)    542.18     @ 1.9638 s     5)    709.27     @ 2.6184 s     ⚔ Q             ●●○○     6)    834.30     @ 3.2730 s     ✓W             ●○○○     7)    959.33     @ 3.9276 s     8)    1084.36    @ 4.5822 s     9)    1251.45    @ 5.2368 s     ⚔ W            ●●○○     10)   1376.48    @ 5.8914 s     11)   1501.51    @ 6.5460 s     13)   1626.54    @ 7.2006 s     14)   1793.63    @ 7.8552 s     ⚔ E             ●●●○     15)   1918.66    @ 8.5098 s     ✓W            ●○●○     16)   2043.69    @ 9.1644 s     ✓Q             ○○●○     17)   2168.72    @ 9.8190 s     18)   2335.81    @ 10.4736 s    ⚔ W           ○●●○     19)   2460.84    @ 11.1282 s     20)   2585.87    @ 11.7828 s   * **20** hits are needed; **245 mana** is consumed; and it takes **~11.8 seconds to take down an inner turret with Jax**.   * Total build cost: **13730g** with a Guardian Angel.  So it looks like to me in terms of split-pushing, Veigar is a better teacher of the definition of pain. In order for Veigar to tie with Jax:  * You need DPS * 11.7828 = 2550, so 2550 / 11.7828 = **216.4172 AD** taking into account resistances. To get the raw damage value, we do 216.4172 * 180/100 = **389.5508 raw turret-effective AD**. To get Veigar's required AP, we do (389.5508 - 95.55) / 0.4 =  **735.0021 AP**. To get the base AP without a stacked Rageblade, we take away the bonus stacks leaving us with 735.0021 - (8 * 6) =  **687 AP with unstacked Guinsoo's Rageblade**. If your items leave you with &lt;= 687 AP then Jax will be better at pushing the turret than you. If your items leave you with &gt; 687 AP then you will be pushing faster than Jax.  * If we ignore the Baleful Strike stacks completely, we would be at 661.5 AP and that is only 25.5 AP from competing with Jax.  By the way, Guinsoo's Rageblade was originally a joke but after some rough calculations I realised the lulz.",⚔

Chrysler directly refutes the very Bloomberg article you've linked:  &gt;On Oct. 22, 2012, at 11:10 a.m. ET, the Bloomberg News report “Fiat Says Jeep® Output May Return to China as Demand Rises” stated “Chrysler currently builds all Jeep SUV models at plants in Michigan, Illinois and Ohio. Manley (President and CEO of the Jeep brand) referred to adding Jeep production sites rather than shifting output from North America to China.”  &gt;Despite clear and accurate reporting, the take has given birth to a number of stories making readers believe that Chrysler plans to shift all Jeep production to China from North America, and therefore idle assembly lines and U.S. workforce. It is a leap that would be difficult even for professional circus acrobats.  &gt;Let’s set the record straight: Jeep has no intention of shifting production of its Jeep models out of North America to China. It’s simply reviewing the opportunities to return Jeep output to China for the world’s largest auto market. U.S. Jeep assembly lines will continue to stay in operation. A careful and unbiased reading of the Bloomberg take would have saved unnecessary fantasies and extravagant comments.",®

Higher sampling rates may give the DAC an easier time.  &gt;Asus's specs don't give much info besides the fact that it's using the Realtek® ALC892 8-Channel High Definition Audio CODEC and has ""Absolute Pitch 192kHz/ 24-bit True BD Lossless Sound"".   You could maybe even skip the DSP if you have that many channels out and use software to interact with your hardware drivers that splits/corrects the signal. I know there is software out there for this, but I won't be much help on what your chain should look like if you go this route. You'd be using more of your computers muscle, though, and if you want to do things like use the speakers for modern gaming it might be better to avoid this.  &gt;Keep in mind this is motherboard optical out, so it's most likely lower quality than a good sound card anyways.   The only way optical out can be flawed is through jitter, which most people think is a 'solved problem'.

""Freedom is a true part of the magic of MMOs, and artificial constraints and mechanics can undermine the fiction and the sense that you are living in the virtual world – and when you have a brand as rich and textured as Star Wars™, the last thing you want to do is undermine it. Even worse, the depth and visual splendor of Star Wars™: The Old Republic would be completely lost if players couldn’t jump off the rails and just live in the space from time to time.  I’ve long advocated that moderation is the way to go, and I believe on The Old Republic we are successfully travelling a middle path, a centrist path that takes the strengths of both: provide a directed and balanced game experience inside a lush, free-form Star Wars world. Unfortunatley it seems TOR never actually reached that goal of ""travelling the middle path"". Perhaps it got ambushed by the ""Class Story"" monster along the way.""  And here's a later doozy from Dr Ray: ""When you deliver a game, and you deliver it for a player, you have to capture what they think is the possibility space,"" he explains. ""You need to let them do everything they think they should do, and you can't block them from doing anything they think they should be able to do.

t5_2cneq,lasciate,1351368183,"Taxes:  The argument is that lowering taxes won't do much for the economy. The poor and lower-middle class will use the money to pay down debt instead of buying products and the upper and financier classes will squirrel their money away until the economy improves, which it won't if they don't spend money. The last part is the cycle which lead to the Recession and is what keeps recovery slow more than any other factor. That being said, both sides want to cut taxes for and/or increase subsidies to the middle class.  Outsourcing:   There are (broadly speaking) two ways to combat outsourcing - increase the cost of imports or decrease the cost of American goods/labor. We can impose tariffs on foreign goods, but that will (especially with regards to China) inevitably lead to a trade war that would be bad for both countries. We can offer government subsidies to companies that produce here in America. That would lower the cost of doing business here at home, but it requires higher taxes or more debt. I'm assuming you think both of those things are to be avoided. Lastly, we could lower the minimum wage, slash benefits, etc. in order to bring the costs of labor closer to those in China. That will mean people are spending even more of their income servicing personal debt and meeting basic human needs, and less on luxury goods and leisure activities. That doesn't leave a lot of room for economic growth.   The biggest obstacle to dealing with outsourcing is not that no one wants to do anything to solve the problem. It's that the problem is systemic, and we're trying to strike a balance between efficiency and helping people™. Propping up low-skill, high-wage domestic manufacturing is becoming so inefficient that it is (or will very soon be) downright immoral to do so. Americans on are over-qualified (not to mention over-entitled) for the jobs they're losing, but under-qualified for the jobs that are staying. Re-training is an issue that's gotten a small amount of play in this election, but it's going to be necessary for the great economic transition that's coming up.",™

t5_2rct2,Rolands_Sword,1351387869,"Well, you kind of are being mean and making gross generalizations based on your personal experiences.  Those people that you just described are the poly analogues of cheating mono people. Most people are shitheads that didn't develop emotionally past high school, with poly people being no exception.  &gt;I will not be friends with or talk to polyamorous people. They talk to people and get emotionally close because ... yes ... they can fuck you and want to fuck you. As a monogamous person you think to yourself, ""well they have this partner and that partner over there so I'm just their friend.""  That's just downright offensive. ""I won't be friends with a gay man because he might try to hit on me, and only wants to get close and get into my pants."" I'm also willing to bet you've encountered single mono guys that  &gt;talk to people and get emotionally close because ... yes ... they can fuck you and want to fuck you  but you just didn't have the notion that he had other partners so you could write him off as not having interest in you.  &gt;No. You're another potential need they can have met in bed.  and are you really going to argue that this is the sole bailiwick of poly people?  Poly is built on being honest and candid with partners and potential partners. As I said in another comment here, anyone that lies like those people did is just a shitty poly person, and is the analogue to a cheating mono person.   All that being said, I also don't really see an issue with being able and willing to sex a friend that I find sexually attractive, because I don't really see it as a big deal. Am I going to be butthurt because they don't return the feeling? No. I'll try flirting *if I am interested* (and remember, being attracted doesn't mean you must or want to act on it), and if she isn't amenable, I'll drop it and keep the friendship. Once again, any poly person that only gets close to you so they can fuck you, is no different than single Nice Guys™.  And some poly people can be mono. I was a serial monogamist for the first 7 years of my dating life (and I was far hornier then than I am now) and I never cheated or felt like I **needed** to see or sex other people. Once again, it's all about being honest with yourself and your [potential] partners.  &gt;not a single polyamorous person **that I have encountered** has had ANYTHING in common with me  FTFY",™

t5_2qhwp,Farkamon,1351399575,"Speaking as a member of the game industry, I can tell you why PS2 can't be pushed back, as much as every player, and even the development team want it to.  It's a one-word answer.    Marketing.  SOE is very good at marketing.  They've been doing it for a very long time.  At this point they've made numerous ad buys, scheduled a great deal of videos, and probably will have a few site takeovers right around November 20.    A site takeover is where the tops and sides of a website are plastered with big boisterous advertisements, countdowns, and offers to buy Founders Packs.  They might even have a Steam offer, and if anyone's worked with Valve, they know they take their sweet, sweet time to respond to changes of that magnitude.  So that delay is not going to happen.  It can't.  Too much money has already been spent setting it up.  I would suggest to the PS2 team that if they're not in Ultra Crunch Mode™ already, they should press that big Overtime button right now and start ordering burritos.  Preferably without sour cream.

t5_2t5sa,MsPrynne,1351461937,"That's...not what ""no true Scotsman"" means. No true Scotsman would be closer to:  A: I know a depressed person who was able to identify that they were suffering from a mental illness without medical help.   B: But depressed people aren't lucid enough to think clearly about their mental state. No truly depressed person could do that.  Not a perfect example, perhaps, but moving on...I could mention argument from authority, but since I don't think of SRSD as a place where we try to rack up argument points by listing off fallacies, I won't continue in this line.  I never said that there's no point in going to a psychiatrist.   I never said that a self-diagnosis was better than a qualified medical diagnosis.   I never said that people shouldn't get treatment if they are able to do so.  HOWEVER. I can recognize that there are many reasons - inability to pay, fear of being committed, fear of being forced to take scary mind-altering drugs, etc., having heard horror stories about the way that people with mental health issues are treated/dismissed/stigmatized - that people may not want to or be able to see a doctor. Even people that do see a doctor *can't necessarily go straight to a psychiatrist,* there are plenty of health plans that require you to go through a gatekeeper, i.e., your GP, who will refer you to a psychiatrist if they decide that you're Really Depressed™ and aren't just *blue*.   Those people still need support and care. Some of them will go to the Internet to find it. We should not dismiss those people by saying things like ""your self-diagnosis is probably wrong."" If you say that to a person who really is wrong - and of course, those people do exist - you're probably not going to convince them. If you say that to someone who *really is depressed,* you are going to do that person damage.  Even if someone claims to be depressed and they're really not, *if someone is online claming to be depressed, they need kindness and support,* not dismissiveness.

t5_2t5sa,BlackHumor,1351467657,"&gt;That's...not what ""no true Scotsman"" means. No true Scotsman would be closer to:  What? Yes it is. You're disqualifying all the examples of the category that don't fit with your argument because they don't fit your argument and not because they're not actual members of the category. You're saying that the kinds of self-diagnoses that are most likely to be wrong aren't ""really"" self-diagnoses.  (In contrast, the way you've phrased my argument to force a No True Scotsman on it is not actually my argument. I freely admit there exist actually depressed people whose self-diagnoses of depression are accurate. That's not a counter-argument in the slightest, because I'm arguing that the pattern exists, not that there aren't any exceptions.  Also please, PLEASE stop conflating ""severely depressed"" with ""truly depressed"". As I've already said before it can be very dangerous to conflate them.)  &gt;HOWEVER. I can recognize that there are many reasons - inability to pay, fear of being committed, fear of being forced to take scary mind-altering drugs, etc., having heard horror stories about the way that people with mental health issues are treated/dismissed/stigmatized - that people may not want to or be able to see a doctor. Even people that do see a doctor can't necessarily go straight to a psychiatrist, there are plenty of health plans that require you to go through a gatekeeper, i.e., your GP, who will refer you to a psychiatrist if they decide that you're Really Depressed™ and aren't just blue.  I'm totally with you on this.  &gt;Those people still need support and care. Some of them will go to the Internet to find it.   And with you on these two sentences.  &gt;We should not dismiss those people by saying things like ""your self-diagnosis is probably wrong.""  Aaaand here's where you go wrong. Saying that someone's self-diagnosis is accurate makes about as much sense as saying that someone's illegal abortion is safe. It's very strange to me to say that you care so much about getting better healthcare for depressed people and then also seem to want to pretend that the state of their medical care doesn't actually need fixing.  &gt;Even if someone claims to be depressed and they're really not, if someone is online claming to be depressed, they need kindness and support, not dismissiveness. It's shitty and classist to say ""well until you go to a doctor you can't be sure"" because that's not the point, it's minimizing and derailing and shitty.  Yes that's right, but it's also irrelevant. If someone on the internet told me they were thinking about getting an illegal abortion, I'd be supportive of their choice AND I'd still maintain my belief that illegal abortions are incredibly unsafe and should never be necessary. You don't need to believe that someone is getting effective treatment to be sympathetic for them.",™
t5_2qh2p,Dudesan,1351468042,"I've heard many christians claim that there's a distinction between ""moral, civil, and ceremonial laws"", but not one has ever been able to give me a straight answer about how they tell the difference between the three. It's clearly about what they find personally distasteful or silly, but admitting that that was the case would rather undermine their positions, so don't expect them to admit it. Apart from a few commands which were explicitly intended for a specific people at a specific time, there is absolutely nothing to indicate that most of these laws weren't supposed to be binding for everyone for all time. Indeed, in many places (See Leviticus 23:21, for example), it's explicitly stated that they *are*.  Remember, many Christians find it more comfortable to believe in a god who doesn't condone, command or commit murder, slavery, rape, child abuse, animal abuse, arson, torture, ritual mutilation, fratricide, patricide, matricide, infanticide, genocide, and so on than to believe in one who does. Unfortunately, since the Bible (Old Testamant and New) is pretty clear about Yahweh's position on these things, holding a belief in Loving Hippie Jesus™ requires ignoring huge portions of it. Or just never reading it in the first place, which seems to be the most popular option.  Well, let's see what Jesus has to say about that:  &gt;“Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished.  (Matthew 5:17-18, NIV)  Some Christians claim that his death and resurrection ""fulfill"" this. That is bullshit for one simple reason: last time I checked, Heaven and Earth haven't passed away.  Jesus also made his views on people ""picking and choosing"" quite clear:  &gt;[Jesus] answered them, “And why do you break God’s commandment because of your tradition? For God said:    *Honor your father and your mother;* and, *The one who speaks evil of father or mother must be put to death.*  &gt; But you say, ‘Whoever tells his father or mother, “Whatever benefit you might have received from me is a gift committed to the temple”—  he does not have to honor his father.’ In this way, you have revoked God’s word because of your tradition. Hypocrites! Isaiah prophesied correctly about you when he said:    &gt;These people honor Me with their lips, but their heart is far from Me.  They worship Me in vain, teaching as doctrines the commands of men.”  (Matthew 15:3-9, NIV)   Looks like Jesus has quite a bit to say about people who ignore commandments, in fact. But maybe it's just Matthew?  &gt;It is easier for heaven and earth to disappear than for the least stroke of a pen to drop out of the Law.  (Luke 16:17, NIV)  Okay, so Jesus is a bust. Let's see what the Epistles have to say about the Mosaic Code:  &gt; If you really keep the royal law found in Scripture, “Love your neighbor as yourself,” you are doing right.  But if you show favoritism, you sin and are convicted by the law as lawbreakers. For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it.   (James 2:8-10, NIV)  &gt;All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness,  (2 Timothy 3:16)  &gt;Do we, then, nullify the law by this faith? Not at all! Rather, we uphold the law.  (Romans 3:31)  &gt;Know this first of all, that *there is no prophecy of scripture that is a matter of personal interpretation*, for no prophecy ever came through human will; but rather human beings moved by the holy Spirit spoke under the influence of God.""  (2 Peter 1:20-21 NAB) ",™

t5_2s48x,Nienordir,1351470001,"Honestly playing the objective in PS2 is boring, it's the right move, but it's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ boring. Just today we had a huge zerg at one of the stations.     I'm talking about at least 5-6 sunderers, more than a dozen tanks filling the whole courtyard and at least 40+ people sitting around bored to death waiting for the station to flip, while the opposition had already given up leaving the place completely uncontested..but you still sit around bored for like 10 minutes until you can move on..that's not fun at all.    I don't think that fighting at the crown is that much fun either, especially with all the draw distance/clipping issues. There is this famous line of rocks near the bridge, where usually dozens of people hang out and I couldn't snipe them, because the game decided that they weren't important enough to draw, but those stupid tanks on the mountain range, that I can't even hit or damage..they get drawn in favor of infantry near by..same with snipers on/near the bridge, that kill me with 'invisibility hacks' because they get culled by the engine..how am I supposed to react to something that's impossible to see?    But the thing is, who cares about owning territory when it simply doesn't matter. You have more resources than you ever need unless you get killed a lot or really only want to play with specialized units. And if you're not swimming in certs, then you want to go where the exp is, to make more builds viable, because there's no fun in using a 'useless' unupgraded unit.    Finally there are no consequences for losing a connection to the warpgate other than no resource gain (that you don't care about). So in order to make things more interesting they need to change the dynamic of the game, giving people a reason to cut-off territory as a valid strategy.    Imagine what would happen if cutting off the crown from the warpgate would stop infinite respawns and cause a respawn ticket count to run out. You could starve the defense by controlling the surrounding territory, force the faction to reinforce with galaxy drops or force them to take back at least one hex, which would split up forces from the crown and make both hot spots weaker..same with sunderers on both offense/defense..no adjacent hex with connection to warp gate? Just a few more respawns and that thing is useless until you move it back into a hex that is contested but adjacent to one you own with connection to the warpgate..    So until they make a change like that, fighting for territory is pointless..now that I think about it another option would be to increase resource cost when you lose control of a point. For every surrounding hex that you don't own, the resource cost for spawning stuff there goes up, once you lose 3/4 of the hexes even infantry respawns start to cost infantry resources, once its completely surrounded by enemy territory cost is doubled again..now there are reasons to reinforce from bases further away, because its cheaper, but it costs time to get there.._AND_ you can't hold a place forever, because people will quickly run out of resources and lose the ability to spawn there, if they don't make serious efforts to connect that place again..",♥

All those things help in high school, big time.    Another thing that helped was that every Friday and Saturday I could, I was going out to party/hang out.

t5_2qh1a,wadcann,1351531219,"This has little to do with Linux or Ubuntu, frankly.  Apple basically used their position as monopoly provider of a platform to move into the position of taking a 30% cut of the gross of all software sold on that platform and blocking competitors from moving in.  That's an extremely ballsy move; the obvious concern is that it could easily have backfired and killed off their platform if developers or customers rebelled.  However, it worked.  Apple shifted vast amounts of money from the rest of the software development and sales cycle to themselves and became the largest company in the world.  Microsoft is not stupid, watched this, waited to see whether it would work out, and saw that it was extremely profitable.  Microsoft now intends to do exactly this as well.  The money that Microsoft will make will be coming in large part from companies like Valve and brick-and-mortar retailers, who provide software stores and will be driven out of the market; Microsoft will own the retailing market for Windows platforms and enjoy all the cash and the vertical monopoly that comes with that.  I like Linux, don't get me wrong.  I use Linux as my day-to-day system, I develop for Linux, and I think that Linux is the cat's pajamas.  But what Valve is saying here has more to do with desperation at the impeding obliteration of their business model by Microsoft than anything to do with the particular technical merits of Linux.  Linux just happens to be the third-most-popular (and a distant third, at that) desktop OS after MacOS (which Apple has already sewn up retail on) and Windows (which Microsoft is about to sew up retail on).  Governments don't seem very interested in stepping in on anti-trust grounds (which actually really surprises me, at least in the EU; this will basically let two US companies control software retail and have extremely powerful market control affecting publishers and developers).  Anyway, the point is that Linux is Valve's only even *possible* out right now.  They've probably protested to Microsoft, and Microsoft has done the math as to what benefits Microsoft the most and presumably said something along the lines of ""Not interested.  We're moving in and taking over.""  When Valve is saying ""Linux more viable than Windows 8 for gaming"", they *mean* that ""Linux is the only viable option remaining for Valve"".  An excellent possibility (and the one that my money tends to be on) is that Valve is simply about to be crushed.  A major problem is that there has been relatively little interest in using Linux as a stable platform for distributing binaries, and Valve is fundamentally a binary software vendor.  Linux distros have built Linux into a phenomenal platform for open-source software.  Linux source compatibility is excellent.  Most distros have a mechanism for QAing and pushing updates of all software on the system that should make Windows and Mac OS X users green with envy.  However, Linux, much as I love it, simply has not measured up to Microsoft or Apple when it comes to binary compatibility, which is an *essential* part of being a platform to sell commercial, closed-source software.  I have a whole collection of Loki, LGP, and other binary-only software packages.  These companies are not incompetent; they probably represented some of the best concentration of practical wisdom about how to keep Linux binaries running.  However, very few of the commercial Linux binaries that I have work out-of-the-box after a few years.  [There is *very* little knowledge out there about how to package Linux binary-only software](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/qytgq/binwiki_a_wiki_with_information_on_binary/).  There is a dubious commitment to binary-only software on the part of a lot of important Linux folks, many of whom originally wound up using Linux because, dammit, they were fed up with the nonsense attached to closed-source stuff.  I do *not* think that there is currently the kind of cross-distro commitment that would make ""write on one (x86_64) distro, run anywhere, and keep running"" a viable possibility.  I'm not sure that enough projects like xorg have that kind of commitment to keep binaries running (as can be seen from the abandonment of DGA that kind of commitment hasn't been present in the past).  Linux software tends to run on systemwide libraries rather than a packaging scheme relying on the developer of a particular software package determining and QAing the binary library that will ship.  This means that Linux software tends to get ""automatic"" bugfixes in things like libjpeg, and tends to be more memory-efficient than Windows software (only one version of libjpeg need be loaded into memory!).  However, it *also* makes for a fluid, shifting environment to build on.  That's not a huge problem for open-source packages; after the software is written, someone else can jump in and submit a fix, and distros have a mechanism to QA the distro as a whole, and push down updates to that software.  But it is tremendously problematic for closed-source packages, where the company that wrote the package may not be providing updates (or even exist!)  You *cannot* have the OSS API stop working (as has happened before).  You *cannot* have 32-bit binaries rely on 32-bit libraries that are not present on 64-bit boxes like Mesa, libSDL_mixer (a current example from Debian wheezy) (as has happened before).  You *cannot* have DGA go away, the C++ ABI change, and so forth.  Once a binary is working and shipped, if you want to be a binary distribution platform, you must keep it working.  Canonical has seen a golden opportunity to displace Microsoft as the ""open platform provider"" (and in this context, Microsoft *is* currently open; not open-source, but anyone can develop and release software and sell software without the approval of the platform provider).  They've been trying to make Ubuntu more-approachable for the average user, which is probably a necessary step in that direction.  However, there is a *phenomenal* amount of engineering and policy work that would have to be done to pull this off, and I am dubious that this can be successfully done.  First, either one Linux distro like Ubuntu would have to become *the* binary platform (in which case they'd lose the support of a lot of Linux developers who don't use or care about that binary platform), or a *ton* of distros would have to push through a bunch of common standards for binary compatibility (that, at the least, would be tied to one processor architecture, which may not go over well with the Stallman crowd) such that software can run everywhere.  Second, all changes have to happen in a rapidly-closing time window.  Microsoft is betting on inertia, and I think that they're right; Windows developers are going to tend to keep developing for Windows, and Windows users are going to tend to keep using Windows.  They have software investments in Windows, and knowledge investments.  Once a locked-down Windows is firmly in-place...well, Linux is still an *option*, but it's much harder to pull off a transition.  Windows 8 is out *now*.  Microsoft will be doing everything possible to establish it and establish themselves in a monopoly retail position.  Third, Linux has to be usable for Windows users.  That doesn't mean ""usable"", that means ""usable for Windows users"".  They have decades of user experience built up with Windows.  They know what a ""C"" drive is and that Alt-F4 closes programs.  They know how to use a set of Windows-based programs; remember, Excel is a job skill.  You either have to successfully break significant experience-based lock-in or clone a sufficient amount of Windows behavior.  Fourth, there are no great options today for packaging third-party software.  Microsoft has made it easy and provided documentation, and ""you do this and we'll make things work"" guarantees.  Linux has different init systems, different desktop environments, different ways of getting root permission to install software, no single package format, etc.  Distro-packaged open-source software is a solved and *well*-solved problem on Linux.  Third-party packaged binary software is not solved at all, and frankly, Microsoft has a lot of people who understand this space well working on it.  Every vendor that wants to install packaged Linux software has had to come up with their own scheme (Desura, Humble Bundle, Loki, LGP, the other individual vendors) with little guidance or guarantees about things continuing to work or has to try and hook into the distro's packaging system (Gameolith, some Humble Bundle packages) with the caveat that the distro feels free to break things at will.  The closest thing to a set of best practices is copying whatever Ryan C. Gordon is hacking together.  That's not going to fly as a real-world binary software platform.  I think that a lot of Linux-folk will get a gut disagreement here: ""No, no, this will all work"".  But I think that a lot of that is because there is a tendency to *want* this to be true.  If it works out, it maybe means Linux World Domination™, means that the market value of their skillset skyrockets, means that they get a big fat affirmation of an earlier choice they made.  That's great and all, but there's a very human tendency to believe in things that we'd like to believe in.  I personally, if I had to bet, would be that Canonical and friends will *not* pull this off within the available time and that Microsoft will get their Microsoft equivalent of what Apple has done.  I don't think that the EU is going to jump in to help Canonical out with anti-trust actions, because they aren't SuSE or another EU-based company with political connections there.  But, hey, I'll be watching, and we'll see what happens.  Just my two cents, of course.",™

Deuteronomy 22 22:20 But if this thing be true, and the tokens of virginity be not found for the damsel:  22:21 Then they shall bring out the damsel to the door of her father's house, and the men of her city shall stone her with stones that she die: because she hath wrought folly in Israel, to play the whore in her father's house: so shalt thou put evil away from among you.  ""But those mine enemies, which would not that I should reign over them, bring hither, and slay them before me."" (Luke 19:27. In a parable, but spoken of favorably.)  John 15:6 If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned.  Jesus encouraged the beating of slaves: ""And that servant [slave], which knew his lord's will, and prepared not himself, neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes."" (Luke 12:47)  Matthew 10:34 ""Do not suppose that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I did not come to bring peace, but a sword.  Jesus said that whoever calls somebody a ""fool"" shall be in danger of hell fire (Matthew 5:22), yet he called people ""fools"" himself (Matthew 23:17)  1 Samuel 15  15:2 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I remember that which Amalek did to Israel, how he laid wait for him in the way, when he came up from Egypt.	     15:3 Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.  31:15 And Moses said unto them, Have ye saved all the women alive?  31:17 Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him.  31:18 But all the women children, that have not known a man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves.  ""Anyone who does not provide for their relatives, and especially for their own household, has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.""(1 Timothy 5:8)  Marrying a divorced woman is adultery. (Matthew 5:32)  If you do something wrong with your eye or hand, cut/pluck it off (Matthew 5:29-30,  He irrationally cursed a fig tree for being fruitless out of season (Matthew 21:18-19, and Mark 11:13-14). He broke the law by stealing corn on the Sabbath (Mark 2:23), and he encouraged his disciples to take a horse without asking permission (Matthew 21)  Matthew 5:17-18 17 Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.  18 I tell you the truth, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished.  New International Version (©1984) The LORD was with the men of Judah. They took possession of the hill country, but they were unable to drive the people from the plains, because they had iron chariots.  1 Corinthians 6:9-10  English Standard Version (ESV)  9 Or do you not know that the unrighteous[a] will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived:  neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men who practice homosexuality,[b] 10 nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God.  Kings 2 2:23 And he went up from thence unto Bethel: and as he was going up by the way, there came forth little children out of the city, and mocked him, and said unto him, Go up, thou bald head; go up, thou bald head.  2:24 And he turned back, and looked on them, and cursed them in the name of the LORD. And there came forth two she bears out of the wood, and tare forty and two children of them.    34:13 And thorns shall come up in her palaces, nettles and brambles in the fortresses thereof: and it shall be an habitation of dragons, and a court for owls.  34:14 The wild beasts of the desert shall also meet with the wild beasts of the island, and the satyr shall cry to his fellow; the screech owl also shall rest there, and find for herself a place of rest.   ""And if your hand or your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it from you; it is better for you to enter life crippled or lame, than having two hands or two feet, to be cast into the eternal fire,"" (Matt. 18:8).  ""And these will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life"" (Matt. 25:46).   31 “Behold, I am against you, O arrogant one,” Declares the Lord God of hosts, “For your day has come, The time when I will punish you  ""And the devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are also; and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever,"" (Rev. 20:10).  Women's rights: Genesis 3:16  Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.   Isaiah 3:12  As for my people, children are their oppressors, and women rule over them.   1 Corinthians 11:3  But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God.   1 Corinthians 14:34-36  Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but they are commanded to be under obedience as also saith the law. And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church.   Ephesians 5:22-24  Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body. Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing.   1 Timothy 2:11-15  Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection. But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence. For Adam was first formed, then Eve. And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression. Notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing.   Titus 2:4-5  Teach the young women to be ... obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.   1 Peter 3:1  Likewise, ye wives, be in subjection to your own husbands.  Numbers 31:15 And Moses said unto them, Have ye saved all the women alive? 31:17 Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him.  31:18 But all the women children, that have not known a man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves.

t5_2soy6,JasonMacker,1351571164,"&gt; It seems to me that left wing politics (government welfare, helping the poor, taxing the rich, etc) are more consistent with religious texts (particularly the Bible).  Because this is a myth invented by the [New Left](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_left) so that they could justify being religious and a leftist (so that they don't get accused of being evil commie atheists).  Read the Bible. Jesus said anyone who disbelieves in him ought to suffer a worse fate than Sodom and Gomorrah (Mark 6:11). He said he did not come to bring peace, but a sword (Matt 10:34).  If you're going to scream ""out of context"" for these things, that's exactly what I'm talking about. What we see here is that both the Christian Left and the Christian Right accuse each other of talking verses out of context, because they use their religious teachings to justify whatever nonsense they wish.  According to the Christian Left, for about 1500 years, every single Christian scholar and theologian was ""interpreting"" the Bible incorrectly. From Origen to Augustine to Aquinas to Luther, they were all ignorant fools who had no idea what Jesus's ""real"" message was. These men, who dedicated their whole lives to studying the Bible and theology, got everything wrong when it comes to social and economic issues.  It's only AFTER the Enlightenment, when anti-religious views began to popularize, that suddenly Christians began to say ""No, we were against racism and sexism all along! Jesus preached social justice!"" And as a result of this, all the horrible things that Christians have done are excused. All those slave owners who point to the Gospels and the Epistles to justify slavery, who point to the descendants of Noah as how sinfulness correlates with skin color, etc. they're not Real True Christians™ who believe in the Bible! Those are hypocrites who aren't following Jesus Christ! Yes, they say they are Christians, they go to Church, they read the Bible, etc. but because they're doing something I find morally abhorrent, they're not real Christians! Oh, and they also hate gays. I don't have a problem with that. Well, I do now, because homosexuality is a lot more socially acceptable these days than before. Did I mention how Jesus was a champion of gay rights?  And you can notice this trend with just about everything. First they argue, using Scripture to say that it's sinful, immoral, etc. Then they say that it's going to cause problems in society and lead to our downfall. Then, when it's widely accepted, they claim they've been in favor of it all along!  Women's rights, civil rights, gay rights... all of which have been opposed by religious people, and MOSTLY by religious people. But don't expect to be taught this in school. Instead, we don't mention religion anymore when it comes to social justice. Don't talk about how Thomas Paine opposed Christianity and was a feminist. Don't mention that Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton were atheists who rejected Christianity because of its sexism and other irrational teachings. Don't teach about how the civil rights movement was largely opposed by Christians who quoted Scripture to justify their actions. Only focus on a Good True Christian like Martin Luther King Jr., who protested racism the Correct Way, unlike that Muslim Malcom X or that atheist [A. Philip Randolph](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._Philip_Randolph), who you've probably never heard of. By the way, the ""I Have A Dream"" speech didn't use a single quote of Jesus. Take a look at theses quotes:  &gt;&gt;""I have a dream, that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character. I have a dream today!""  &gt;&gt;""A white has no superiority over black nor a black has any superiority over white except by piety and good action.""  Oh, the second quote isn't from Martin Luther King Jr., it's from [Muhammad](http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Muhammad). And this is the next tactic that Christian Leftists use. They don't just pick and choose from within Christianity, they steal from other religious traditions too, without attribution. As long as someone somewhere identifies as religious and says something good, a leftist Christian will use it as a defense of religion (but if it's something bad then it's obviously due to some other factor besides religion).  And that's why Christian leftists absolutely love Gandhi. He gave them their motto: ""I like your Christ. I do not like your Christians. Your Christians are so unlike your Christ. The materialism of affluent Christian countries appears to contradict the claims of Jesus Christ that says it's not possible to worship both Mammon and God at the same time.""  ...except that [Gandhi never actually said that](http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Mohandas_K._Gandhi#Disputed).  So you see, they just invent whatever nonsense and ""facts"" they wish, as long as it justifies their worldview. Jesus has always promoted pacifism and nonviolence, you and all the other Christian theologians who have studied Scripture and concluded things like [Just War](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_war) and that [we must temporarily torture people on earth so that they attain eternal salvation in heaven](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Inquisition) are so clearly deluded. Jesus, the man who had to be tortured to save mankind, would never argue for torture!  I can't make the irrational, Orwellian nature of the Christian Left any more obvious than this. But I hope this explains it well. [Have fun doing research](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Left)! Remember, whatever the social causes of the current times, Jesus has been in favor of it all along!  [-Jason](http://www.reddit.com/r/JasonMacker)",™

The relevance to Micronesia is two fold. For one, the Japanese installed the same type of British-built pre-World War II guns on many of the Micronesian Islands in the east, Palau in the south and the CNMI in the north. The Kiska guns allow for an examination of the differential effects of climatic condition on the decay of these. This gun still has some wooden components, as well as sections of rubberised canvas in situ. Secondly, this particular gun is significant on a regional, if not a global scale as it the only known surviving gun to have come from the battleship Fuji, the first battleship built by the British for the Empire of Japan (in 1894). The success of the Fuji led to successive contracts for British naval yards and to a close co-operation between the British and Japanese navies, which effectively facillitated Japan's entry into World War I at the side of Britain—which in turn resulted in Japan occupying the German colonies in Micronesia and its entry as a colonial power in the region.""",©

This triggered the extinction of almost 70% of the species of life on Earth including the dinosaurs. Other impacts prior to this one have caused even greater extinctions. **Preventing collisions with the Earth by hypervelocity asteroids, meteoroids, and comets is the most important immediate space challenge facing human civilization.** This is the Impact Imperative. We now believe that while there are about 2000 earth orbit crossing rocks greater than 1 kilometer in diameter, there may be as many as 200,000 or more objects in the 100 m size range.  Can anything be done about this fundamental existence question facing our civilization? The answer is a resounding yes! By using an intelligent combination of Earth and space based sensors coupled with an infra‐structure of high‐energy laser stations and other secondary mitigation options, we can deflect inbound asteroids, meteoroids, and comets and prevent them from striking the Earth. This can be accomplished by irradiating the surface of an inbound rock with sufficiently intense pulses so that ablation occurs. **This ablation acts as a small rocket incrementally changing the shape of the rock’s orbit around the Sun. One‐kilometer size rocks can be moved sufficiently in about a month while smaller rocks may be moved in a shorter time span.**  ^(© 2003 American Institute of Physics)",©

I personally believe Romney is a conniving scumbag, but it's important to note that the only lie in his comment was use of the word ""all."" Please note the items in bold:   *""Chrysler Group's production plans for the Jeep® brand have become the focus of public debate.*   *I feel obliged to unambiguously restate our position: Jeep production will not be moved from the United States to China.*   *North American production is critical to achieving our goal of selling 800,000 Jeep vehicles by 2014. In fact, U.S. production of our Jeep models has nearly tripled (it is expected to be up 185%) since 2009 in order to keep up with global demand.*   *We also are investing to improve and expand our entire U.S. operations, including our Jeep facilities. The numbers tell the story:*   *• We will invest more than $1.7 billion to develop and produce the next generation Jeep SUV, the successor of the Jeep Liberty -- including $500 million directly to tool and expand our Toledo Assembly Complex and will be adding about 1,100 jobs on a second shift by 2013.*  *• At our Jefferson North Assembly Plant, where we build the Jeep Grand Cherokee, we have created 2,000 jobs since June 2009 and have invested more than $1.8 billion.*   *• In Belvidere, where we build two Jeep models, we have added two shifts since 2009 resulting in an additional 2,600 jobs.*   *With the increase in demand for our vehicles, especially Jeep branded vehicles, we have added more than 11,200 U.S. jobs since 2009. Plants producing Jeep branded vehicles alone have seen the number of people invested in the success of the Jeep brand grow to more than 9,300 hourly jobs from 4,700. This will increase by an additional 1,100 as the Liberty successor, which will be produced in Toledo, is introduced for global distribution in the second quarter of 2013.*   ***Together, we are working to establish a global enterprise and previously announced our intent to return Jeep production to China, the world's largest auto market, in order to satisfy local market demand, which would not otherwise be accessible. Chrysler Group is interested in expanding the customer base for our award-winning Jeep vehicles, which can only be done by establishing local production. This will ultimately help bolster the Jeep brand, and solidify the resilience of U.S. jobs.***  *Jeep is one of our truly global brands with uniquely American roots. This will never change. So much so that we committed that the iconic Wrangler nameplate, currently produced in our Toledo, Ohio plant, will never see* **full production** *outside the United States.*  *Jeep assembly lines will remain in operation in the United States and will constitute the backbone of the brand.*  *It is inaccurate to suggest anything different.*   ***Sergio Marchionne**""*  Correct me if I'm wrong, but it appears as though there will be **some** production outside the US; just not **all** production.",®

Just make sure you're doing the best you can for your health from now on - despite anecdotal evidence to the contrary (hah), [drinking actually has a negative impact on fertility](http://www.drinkaware.co.uk/alcohol-and-you/health/is-alcohol-harming-your-fertility), so you're helping your future plans in many ways if you stick with not drinking. :)  I had one night of spectacular booze abuse during my first month, after ""a period"", as I was oblivious to being pregnant and figured after a year of trying and feeling the same as usual, it was unlikely it would change anything. I'm not happy about this, but what's done's done. Fretting over it would accomplish nothing. My obgyn was cautiously reassuring when I told her about this, saying I should only concern myself with not doing that again. So I'll pass along the advice. ;)  Get started on prenatal vitamins now if you haven't already, make positive changes in your life if you feel there's room for those and... relax. Trying to conceive can get a bit crazy at times with the relative unpredictability of it, but that's part of the mystery of it I guess. :)",™

(BUSINESS WIRE), Aug 9, 1999 - In a effort to make computers friendly and affordable for families, Mattel Inc. (NYSE:MAT) has announced that it has teamed up with Patriot Computers to launch the first-ever BARBIE® and HOT WHEELS® branded PCs for children.  The new BARBIE® and HOT WHEELS® PCs, which include a 15-inch monitor, will be available from Patriot Computers at $599 this September and can be financed for as little as $14.98(a) per month. Each computer system will feature an Intel® Celeron(TM) processor 333 MHz and will be loaded with a library of popular education and entertainment titles from Mattel Media and The Learning Company, with an approximate retail value of more than $500.  Created with children's interests in mind, the customized BARBIE® and HOT WHEELS® PCs will be specially designed to capture the essence of each brand. For example, the beautiful silver-colored BARBIE® computer with pink and purple floral accents, will include a customized tower, monitor, keyboard and speakers and will come with special Barbie® accessories such as the Barbie® Digital Camera, a Barbie® mouse, mousepad and CD holder.

t5_2qh2p,Dudesan,1351662086,"I've heard many christians claim that there's a distinction between ""moral, civil, and ceremonial laws"", but not one has ever been able to give me a straight answer about how they tell the difference between the three. It's clearly about what they find personally distasteful or silly, but admitting that that was the case would rather undermine their positions, so don't expect them to admit it. Apart from a few commands which were explicitly intended for a specific people at a specific time, there is absolutely nothing to indicate that most of these laws weren't supposed to be binding for everyone for all time. Indeed, in many places (See Leviticus 23:21, for example), it's explicitly stated that they *are*.  Remember, many Christians find it more comfortable to believe in a god who doesn't condone, command or commit murder, slavery, rape, child abuse, animal abuse, arson, torture, ritual mutilation, fratricide, patricide, matricide, infanticide, genocide, and so on than to believe in one who does. Unfortunately, since the Bible (Old Testamant and New) is pretty clear about Yahweh's position on these things, holding a belief in Loving Hippie Jesus™ requires ignoring huge portions of it. Or just never reading it in the first place, which seems to be the most popular option.  Well, let's see what Jesus has to say about that:  &gt;“Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished.  (Matthew 5:17-18, NIV)  Some Christians claim that his death and resurrection ""fulfill"" this. That is bullshit for one simple reason: last time I checked, Heaven and Earth haven't passed away.  Jesus also made his views on people ""picking and choosing"" quite clear:  &gt;[Jesus] answered them, “And why do you break God’s commandment because of your tradition? For God said:    *Honor your father and your mother;* and, *The one who speaks evil of father or mother must be put to death.*  &gt; But you say, ‘Whoever tells his father or mother, “Whatever benefit you might have received from me is a gift committed to the temple”—  he does not have to honor his father.’ In this way, you have revoked God’s word because of your tradition. Hypocrites! Isaiah prophesied correctly about you when he said:    &gt;These people honor Me with their lips, but their heart is far from Me.  They worship Me in vain, teaching as doctrines the commands of men.”  (Matthew 15:3-9, NIV)   Looks like Jesus has quite a bit to say about people who ignore commandments, in fact. But maybe it's just Matthew?  &gt;It is easier for heaven and earth to disappear than for the least stroke of a pen to drop out of the Law.  (Luke 16:17, NIV)  Okay, so Jesus is a bust. Let's see what the Epistles have to say about the Mosaic Code:  &gt; If you really keep the royal law found in Scripture, “Love your neighbor as yourself,” you are doing right.  But if you show favoritism, you sin and are convicted by the law as lawbreakers. For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it.   (James 2:8-10, NIV)  &gt;All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness,  (2 Timothy 3:16)  &gt;Do we, then, nullify the law by this faith? Not at all! Rather, we uphold the law.  (Romans 3:31)  &gt;Know this first of all, that *there is no prophecy of scripture that is a matter of personal interpretation*, for no prophecy ever came through human will; but rather human beings moved by the holy Spirit spoke under the influence of God.""  (2 Peter 1:20-21 NAB) ",™

Hell, most likely the new flicks will still come out from LucasFilm™, there's just going to be a small print that says owned by Disney.  And how about the fact, that stuff like Pirates of The Caribbean was all Disney?

That is basically in quite detail what I am myself working on (not claiming to be any Messiah though just doing my part...) but basically what I consider every being on this planet should work towards.  Aha, that ""bridge metaphor"" I haven't heard about. That was very interesting to hear. I have removed the details about what I'm working on now, but they are available on one archive page from 2004. If you [check point 9](http://web.archive.org/web/20041207000905/http://www.nonutopia.org/personal/dream/invention.html) after     **This patented method will, when properly used** , i.e.  * *Help us adapt to new powerful future technologies like nano technology.*  Nano technology is the ""ultimate technology"" one can say, the one God is working with. Of course we already have it, it is implemented in every living cell, it is implemented everywhere where atoms are combined with atoms into larger aggreagates, usually denoted molecules.  However, the human technical evolution starting from long time ago, one can say has as its goal to end where we started. The only difference is that now we also understand the technology. We have become like ""children of God"" in one sense.  Anyway, what I am developing has nothing with nano technology to do (even though I am a member of [Foresight Institute](http://foresight.org/)). What I am developing is a service to create anything creatable with our human technology and knowledge on demand, with the side effect to make the human mind benevolent and intelligent (as I consider most part of the humanity to be in a kind of sleeping state now....).  Basically this Artificiall Intelligence (not a human like AI) people will ""pray to"" (although no rituals and such) and this will over time adapt the humanity to God like beings that are able to both Love unconditionally and be creative (they are related) at the same time.  I do not know what will happen in the future, but my guess has been during the last 11 years, since I told my son about this in 2001 after I had visited  the fantastic ""StarLab"" in Brussels, which unfortunately went bankrupt the same summer after my visit, what I told him was:  Apart from adapting the humanity towards advanced technologies where they can get anything they can ever want as long as it is not in conflict with anyone else's desires and needs and does not limit any one elses freedom, it will also develop the human species into thinking creative individuals, as they also need to specify in detail what they want. This thinking enables their logical thinking again (which they were born with) and logic is the same as unconditional love due to my definition.  This process I denote the [Singularity](http://wish-it.se/hip/singularity2). What was also interesting was when I told my spouse, who has got a Catholic education, my definition of the Singularity, she said that this was what Jesus said as well.  So, could this what I'm describing and working on, be this ""bridge metaphor"" you mentioned? ",❣

The effect of this legislation on bicycling fatalities is examined by subjecting data from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System to a panel analysis, using a control-group methodology. A helmet law reduces fatalities by about 15 percent in the long run, less in the short run. There is no evidence of spillover effects (to adults) or substitution effects (youths choosing other methods of transportation) associated with implementation of a helmet law. Through 2000, existing helmet laws have saved 130 lives. If all states had adopted helmet laws in 1975, more than 1500 lives would have been saved. © 2004 by the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management.   - Bicycle Helmets: It's Time To Use Them: The Evidence That They Reduce Head Injuries Is Too Strong To Ignore Formats Available in JSTOR: Page Scan, PDF  Abstract Bibliographic Information Author Information Notes and References Items Citing This Item Abstract(back to top)  An abstract for this item is not available.

Formats Available in JSTOR: Page Scan, PDF  Abstract Bibliographic Information Author Information Notes and References Abstract(back to top)  The issue of mandatory cycle helmets is highly contentious. The aim of this paper is not to argue for or against legislation but to suggest criteria on which the debate should focus. This is done by attempting to answer the question: 'What criteria must be met before cycle helmet wearing is enforced?' Consideration is given to principles, precedents and consequences and four criteria are suggested. The criteria are to do with effectiveness, personal liberty, public acceptability and the promotion of the public health benefits of cycling.  - Injury Patterns In Cyclists Attending An Accident And Emergency Department: A Comparison Of Helmet Wearers And Non-Wearers Formats Available in JSTOR: Page Scan, PDF  Abstract Bibliographic Information Author Information Notes and References Items Citing This Item Abstract(back to top)  Objectives—To study circumstances of bicycle accidents and nature of injuries sustained and to determine effect of safety helmets on pattern of injuries. Design—Prospective study of patients with cycle related injuries. Setting—Accident and emergency department of teaching hospital. Subjects—1040 patients with complete data presenting to the department in one year with cycle related injuries, of whom 114 had worn cycle helmets when accident occurred. Main outcome measures—Type of accident and nature and distribution of injuries among patients with and without safety helmets. Results—There were no significant differences between the two groups with respect to type of accident or nature and distribution of injuries other than those to the head. Head injury was sustained by 4/114 (4%) of helmet wearers compared with 100/928 (11%) of non-wearers (P=0.023). Significantly more children wore helmets (50/309 (16%)) than did adults (64/731 (9%)) (P&lt;0.001). The incidence of head injuries sustained in accidents involving motor vehicles (52/288 (18%)) was significantly higher than in those not involving motor vehicles (52/754 (7%)) (ϰ²=28.9, P&lt;0.0001). Multiple logistic regression analysis of probability of sustaining a head injury showed that only two variables were significant: helmet use and involvement of a motor vehicle. Mutually adjusted odds ratios showed a risk factor of 2.95 (95% confidence interval 1.95 to 4.47, P&lt;0.0001) for accidents involving a motor vehicle and a protective factor of 3.25 (1.17 to 9.06, P=0.024) for wearing a helmet. Conclusion—The findings suggest an increased risk of sustaining head injury in a bicycle accident when a motor vehicle is involved and confirm protective effect of helmet wearing for any bicycle accident.

t5_2qh2p,DarrenEdwards,1351711145,"Halloween 1987.  I was pretty much an atheist, I just didn't know the name for it.  I was hanging around with a new group that year.  Some of them pretty superstitious.  The topic of demons came up and we were going to prove once and for all their existence with a ouija board.  A new girl to the school swore a demon, name Bloody Mary, had followed her from her home town.  I volunteered my parents place.  We had a farm, and not only that, it had a graveyard as it was almost it's own town during the early homestead days.  So myself and 4 girls that weren't too creeped out watched a few movies, ate popcorn and waited for my parents to settle down for the evening.  At go time, we realized one important piece was missing: the Ouija board.  Being many miles away from an official Parker Brothers® board we had to improvise.  Drawing it on paper just brought up arguments.  Random letters... That's when I got the great idea to substitute with a scrabble board.  I, thinking this was a joke from the get go, assume that somebody would call bullshit.  Nope, we were go.  We headed out to the graveyard with red candles, matches, playground chalk and Scrabble by Parker Brothers® ready to conjure up the Oregon arch demon Bloody Mary.  I did ponder the repercussions of being sacrilegious to my own distant blood relatives final resting place, but brushed it aside as 2 of these girls were cute.  No matter, they all got spooked half way there.  It was decided that any old place was just as good for summoning spirits, even a cow pasture.  So we stopped in the middle of our field.  I drew out a pentagram, because nothing like arbitrary lines get demon attention.  Candles are lit, and our Oregon demon expert starts in.  I don't remember if she said any magical speeches, but she did attempt to communicate with the great beyond in the same style that Arthur Dent discovered the question to life with less spectacular results.  Bloody Mary did not grant us a triple word score.  We admitted defeat and walked back home.  I never got with any of them.  However, months later my mother attempted to play scrabble and asked for an explanation as to why there was red candle was all over her scrabble board. ",®

But, common knowledge may not be a reliable guide to truth. I've read many of Dr. Guyenet's posts, and while I appreciate his eloquent, direct, and erudite approach to the subject, I think the evidence he presents on this particular issue is insufficient to prove his conclusions. It raises good questions that deserve investigation, but it doesn't persuade me, at least, to forget all about the hypothesis that chronically elevated insulin causes obesity, at least in some people.  I think there is a lot more research that is needed to actually settle the issue, especially new experiments that can conclusively rule out some of the options.  Gary Taubes has an enormous response to Dr. Guyenet's criticisms posted as a series of blog posts:  http://garytaubes.com/2011/09/catching-up-on-lost-time-ancestral-health-symposium-food-reward-palatability-insulin-signaling-carbohydrates-kettles-pots-other-odds-ends-part-i/  Frankly, I haven't gotten around to reading it yet, both because it is a lot of text, which I expect to be dense text, and because I didn't find Dr. Guyenet's criticisms so compelling that I felt the need to understand Taubes's response. I would assume Dr. Guyenet also blogged some sort of response to that response, too, before their tempers died down. ☺",☺

t5_2qh1i,lessnonymous,1351727658,"Not angry at me, but relevant.   My wife is an awesome writer who writes long form articles as a freelancer. She recently interviewed Martin Sheen.   I'm a part time cake decorator.   She posted a photo of one of my cakes to Facebook at about the same time as a link to her interview.   I totally understand her frustration that my cake got many many more [Like 👍]s than her article!",👍
t5_2qioo,skinny_whale,1351727969,"Alright I think it is fixed now. I ran Malwarebytes and got one hit. this is what the log said, if it is of any use to anybody :) Registry Data Items Detected: 1 HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\CryptSvc|Start (Disabled.Cryptsvc) -&gt; Bad: (4) Good: (2) -&gt; Quarantined and repaired successfully.  I have started up succesfully like 4 times in a row so it seems good. Thanks for you support ♥",♥
