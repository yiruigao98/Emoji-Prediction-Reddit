If the instructor is a world-class fighter, but can't communicate effectively to *you* (not to everyone, just to bloody_boston), then all of his expertise isn't worth a nickle to you.  But.  But.  But if the school is filled with people who remind you of those who beat you up in the past, you'll have a hell of a time getting past that.

I‚Äôm writing this letter to explain our position and to correct any misinformation you may have heard about this issue. &gt; &gt;Susan G.

In the past 27 years, we‚Äôve invested more than $1.3 billion to accomplish those goals through research and for programs that educate, screen and treat people in communities all around the world. &gt; &gt;Early screening through mammograms and education are critical to end the suffering from this disease: 98 percent of women treated for early stage breast cancer, before it spreads, are alive five years later. The widespread use of mammography and heightened public awareness of breast cancer both contribute to these favorable statistics. &gt; &gt;And while Komen Affiliates provide funds to pay for screening, education and treatment programs in dozens of communities, **in some areas, the only place that poor, uninsured or under-insured women can receive these services are through programs run by Planned Parenthood.** &gt; &gt;**These facilities serve rural women, poor women, Native American women, women of color, and the un- and under-insured.** As part of our financial arrangements, we monitor our grantees twice a year to be sure they are spending the money in line with our agreements, and we are assured that Planned Parenthood uses these funds only for breast health education, screening and treatment programs. &gt; &gt;**As long as there is a need for health care for these women, we will continue to fund the facilities that meet that need.** &gt; &gt;... &gt; &gt;**Eric Winer, M.D.** Chief Scientific Advisor Susan G.

Guild leaders (or a designated officer in the event of a guild leader being unable to attend) will participate in Q&amp;A sessions with developers, roundtable feedback discussions, and will get a preview of some upcoming game features.  &gt; The goal of the summit is to facilitate an open discussion between guild leaders and the game design team. This event will provide an opportunity for attendees to voice their feedback directly to the teams responsible for the design of Star Wars: The Old Republic, hear the team‚Äôs thoughts and reasons behind design decisions, and discuss the current direction of the game.  &gt; The Guild Summit will be hosted from March 4th ‚Äì 6th, 2012 at the DoubleTree Hotel Austin. Due to space limitations, the event will be invite-only. We've already invited guilds of various backgrounds and sizes to the Summit, from Endgame to Role-playing to PvP guilds, but we've got some space left for additional guild leaders who wish to attend. We ask that interested leaders submit an application, which can be found at this link.* Guild leaders will be evaluated based on the information provided in their application.  &gt; While we welcome applications from guild leaders from anywhere in the world, please be advised that the Summit will be conducted entirely in English. Applications will be accepted until 11:59PM CST (GMT -6) on February 10th. If you have any questions regarding the event, send us an email at guilds@swtor.com!  &gt; *Must be 21 or older to attend.

t5_2qh2a,ajehals,1328120846,"&gt;While what you are saying is mostly true for the copyright end of things, you should note that the DMCA provisions (as Wright explains in the article) carry additional sanctions for people who intentionally remove watermarks (or even file metadata) that display copyright management information for the purpose of copyright infringement.  This rather assumes that the DMCA applies, which it may well not (depending on jurisdiction) and of course the source of the image.  You also need to keep in mind that fair use provisions don't exist every where, nor do protections against incidental infringement.  As such, the use of a copyright mark of some kind (whether embedded or visible, as per the '(c) date name' format or otherwise is essentially up to the author.  The initial assertion that ""To be valid, a copyright notice has to follow the format: ¬© Date Name"" is simply incorrect.  In terms of actual protections, the jurisdiction of the infringer and artist come into play (as to any contracts of licenses) as well as other means of protection.  If I issue an image without a watermark and embed a copyright notice in metadata it is as protected as if I had written 'This photo is under ajehals' copyright' or '(c) 2012 ajehals' on it.",¬©

t5_2qh1i,the-slowpoke-pack,1328138772,"well, i really dont mean to argue with you. But where in copyright law is this listed?  I went to school for audio, and under sampling law, i was lead to believe it was not Legal in any way shape or form  1.	Sampling law was first established in 1991 in the Biz Markie case, when Federal District Court judge Kevin Duffy ruled that ‚Äúrelease of a record containing a sample of another recording without permission was theft.‚Äù -- Sampling in the Record industry, Attorney Michael Ashburne, ¬© 1994 Based on this Precedent, we used to say ‚ÄúThe point at which an unlicensed sample is considered illegal is ‚Äòwhen it is released for sale.‚Äô As long as you don‚Äôt release it for sale, you can sample anything you wish.‚Äù  In early 2005 a Michigan judge ruled ‚ÄúAny uncleared sampling is illegal.‚Äù (Instructor‚Äôs recollection of a newspaper article.) This puts a whole new slant on sampling and the legal dangers we face.  2. To legally use a sample, you must get (at least) two clearances: A. From the Copyright Owner of the Recording (usually, a Record Label) B. From the Copyright Owner of the Song (usually, a Publisher)     and really, i think if they were to play even 30 seconds of a recognizable song, they would be in violation of the 6 exclusive rights of a copyright holder    THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER HAS THESE SIX EXCLUSIVE RIGHTS: ‚éà1.

U.S. District Judge Thelton Henderson said he ""remains in disbelief"" that the department has failed to adopt the reforms.  Henderson's frustration with the pace of improvements was evident throughout a scathing five-page ruling issued Tuesday.  ""This department finds itself woefully behind its peers around the state and nation,"" he wrote.  In his ruling, Henderson increased the oversight authority of a court-appointed monitor. Oakland Police Chief Howard Jordan must now consult with the monitor before making important department decisions such as promoting and disciplining officers and changing policing policy and tactics.  Henderson ordered court hearings if city officials disagreed with the monitor's recommendations.  Quan and Jordan said a federal takeover wouldn't be necessary because Oakland's new leadership has made compliance with the settlement a priority.  ""We believe that the expertise of the monitor, coupled with the new leadership in the Police Department and the city administrator's (office) and my commitment to further incorporate the requirements of the negotiated settlement agreement into OPD's culture, will move Oakland into compliance as quickly as possible,"" Quan said in a prepared statement.  The mayor, police chief, city manager and city attorney have all been in their posts for less than two years.  ""The Oakland Police Department belongs to the community,"" Jordan said. ""The path forward will be guided by an actionable plan.""  Henderson said he will consider proceedings to appoint a federal receiver to run the department if the monitor submits a report this summer showing little improvement.  The judge appointed a monitor in 2003 to ensure the city complied with terms of a $10.5 million settlement of a lawsuit filed by victims of a notorious group of police officers known as ""The Riders.""  The group was accused of beating and framing suspects in the West Oakland area for years. One officer was acquitted at trial and criminal charges against two former officers were dismissed after two trials ended in hung juries. A fourth former officer remains a fugitive who disappeared after charged were filed in 2000.  The current monitor, Robert Warshaw, was appointed in 2010 and oversees the settlement with a staff of seven people.  The settlement included 51 specific reforms the department agreed to make within five years. Henderson noted Tuesday that he's extended the compliance deadline by years to little effect.  ""Defendants have achieved full compliance with just over half of those tasks and, worse yet, have fallen in and out of compliance on some tasks, thus indicating a lack of sustainability,"" Henderson wrote. ""The outstanding tasks are not minor formalities; instead, they are significant areas that go to the heart of any police department, including how internal affairs investigations are completed, how officers are supervised, and the use and reporting of force.""  The judge was responding to a monitor's report submitted earlier this month that included ""serious concerns"" about the department's handling of the so-called Occupy Oakland protests. The monitor told the judge that officers' actions during the Occupy protests put even the small improvements made by the department in jeopardy.  ""We were, in some instances, satisfied with the performance of the department; yet in others, we were thoroughly dismayed by what we observed,"" Warshaw wrote. ""I cannot overstate our concern that although progress on compliance has been slow, even those advancements may have been put in doubt in the face of these events.""  The monitor said the department's response to the Occupy protests will help determine whether police are making progress.  The mayor and police chief announced in December they were hiring an independent investigator to evaluate claims police used excessive force and improper tactics responding to the protests, which included several uses of tear gas, rubber bullets and ""flash-bang"" grenades on protesters.  One protester was hospitalized after being hit in the head with a flash grenade. At least one officer was demoted from lieutenant to sergeant for failing to report a subordinate blacking out his name tag.  Warshaw promised the judge a more in-depth analysis of the Occupy protests when he submits his next report sometime in July. Henderson said the results of that report may prompt him to take the extremely rare step of placing the department in a federal receivership, stripping Oakland of control of its police.  Henderson took the same extraordinary step with the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation's medical health care system. A receiver was appointed in 2006 to run the prison department's health care system after Henderson said CDCR failed to comply with a settlement agreement to provide adequate care to inmates. The court-appointed receiver, J. Clark Kelso, remains in charge of the health care system.  The mayor conceded Oakland police were moving too slowly to reform the department. But Quan said she and the new leaders will move Oakland into compliance as quickly as possible.  However, as the court has explained time and time again, words and promises are not enough, Henderson said.  ""Indeed, each time a previous new mayor or city administrator or chief of police has come on board, the court was reassured that the individual was strongly committed to reforming the Oakland Police Department, and that a change in administration and leadership was all that was necessary to push the city into full compliance,"" the judge wrote.

He even lied to his first pair of pets to keep them from eating from the two trees in the Garden of Eden that could make them something besides a dull-witted hamster in a lush terrarium. Yes, Yahweh told the twins, regarding the Tree of Knowledge ""thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die."" (Genesis 2:17) Well, we have the aftermath of Adam and Eve doing the very thing that Yahweh told them not to do. Oh, and it looks like it was the snake who told the truth (Genesis 3:4). Adam and Eve *didn't* die that day. Oh, and I suppose you're going to trot out that old saw that Adam and Eve were somehow immortal prior to eating the fruit, and therefore, ""metaphorically"" they became mortal that day. Except Yahweh was *pretty darned specific* when he said ""in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die"". And then there's the puzzle of the *other* tree in the Garden of Eden they were forbidden to eat from‚ÄîThe Tree of Life. The tree that *imparts* immortality upon those who eat its fruit. So, what would be the problem with an immortal being eating from a tree that gives immortality? No, Adam and Eve were clearly never immortal, and they didn't die when Yahweh said they would.

Bolivia- -- http://boliviarising.blogspot.com/2007/10/community-organizing-and-rebellion.html - this is a good one that describes the functions of the neighborhood councils in Bolivia. scroll down to ""FEJUVE: Community Organizing"" if you are short on time, that section breaks down the function of these neighborhood councils. I think it is important to note that the conditions that existed here are a lack of representation in the municipal system or an sense of alienation from those with decision making power, and a lack of basic services. These conditions I believe are present in Oakland. Where conditions differ is in racial, ethnic and cultural continuity that is present in Bolivia and is not present in west oakland.  also we were discussing at the last meeting what the basic composition of a group would look like. maybe we could take a page from their book. ""Today there are close to 600 neighborhood councils in El Alto, organized by geographic zone in each of the city‚Äôs nine districts and affiliated at the citywide level through FEJUVE. According to Uruguayan analyst Ra√∫l Zibechi, the basic unit at the neighborhood level must have at least 200 members. The elected leadership committee meets regularly and calls a general neighborhood assembly monthly or semi-monthly. An elected leader must have at least two years of residency in the zone; may not be a merchant, transportation worker, real estate speculator or political party leader; and cannot be a traitor or have colluded with dictators.

Meetings are 2-6 hour public events often held outdoors in the streets, basketball courts, empty lots or other available public spaces. Attendance varies from a typical 50 to 150 citizens. Frequency of assemblies vary from weekly to less than once a month depending on the preferences and needs of the executive body.)

t5_2t9x3,Sydius,1328212071,"**4) Item tips**  * For starting item buy either a **Doran's Ring** or a **Boots of Speed** (with 3 potions). The ring helps your early game, but the boots are part of your final items (you will eventually sell the ring) and thanks to the potions you can stay longer on your lane. * Boots upgrades: **Sorcerer's Shoes** (for magic penetration), **Ionian Boots of Lucidity** (cooldown reduction) or **Mercury's Treads** (for magic resist and tenacity). Choose the best for the situation. Don't forget, sometimes defense is more important than offense, your boots aren't exceptions.  * **Rabadon's Deathcap** is the ""core"" item for every AP champions, but it isn't cheap. Building it first sometimes isn't a good idea. Instead try 2-3 Doran's Ring, or something cheap (but useful). * **Mejai's Soulstealer** is a risky item - only buy it when you're good (and I mean really good). Running around with 0-3 charges won't win the match for you. Running around with 10+ will. * Be careful with **Archangel's Staff**: even thought it's mana and AP bonuses are charming, don't buy it for every champion. To get the 1000 mana at the end of the match you need someone who can spam his abilities (or a lot of cooldown reduction). Someone like Ryze or Annie will fill it relatively quickly. Even thought it's bonus makes it's useful for nearly everyone. * **Hextech Revolver** and **Will of the Ancients"" are good, too. Having spell vamp is a good thing, especially with some nice AoE spells. * **Lich Bane** is a two-edged blade: it can be devastating with huge AP, but never rush for it. In the beginning you won't have enough AP to spend 3470 gold on it, and maybe you can't even use it. For someone like Orianna, Ezreal (or generally everyone who use auto attack a lot) it's perfect, but for the others there are better alternatives. * For extra damage look for **Haunting Guise**, **Void Staff** or **Abyssal Scepter**. They all give you magic penetration, so you will deal more damage with less AP. Useful. * **Rod of Ages** is good, but it needs 10 minutes to be on 100%. The earlier you buy it the more useful it will be. Having a **Catalyst the Protector** in early game is a huge advantage. * Never forget about defense - it can (and will) save your life. **Banshee's Veil**, **Zhonya's Hourglass** and **Rylai's Crystal Scepter** are useful part of any mage's inventory. * If you have money but no space in inventory, buy **Elixirs**. Red makes you stronger, Blue makes you magier, green makes you... Nothing. For a normal AP carry it's useless. * **Wards**. Someone have to buy wards, but only a few people will. And, the sad truth is that (in solo queue) you can't trust anyone but yourself. Buy a few wards and use them - in the brushes, front of the dragon/Baron. Spending 150 gold for 2 wards won't make you poor, but it can save your life from the enemy jungler. And you don't want to make him happy, do you?   **5) The champions**  Here some of the easy-to-learn mages with a few words for each of them. The list isn't complete, but I try to make one where everyone can find the champion he looks for.  * **Annie**. One of the cheapest (450 IP), strongest (2 AoE spells, stun, Tibbers, shield) and cutest (she's a little girl who likes to play with fire and to beat up the wrong guys) champions out there. Very strong in 1v1, devastating in teamfights. Last hit with her Q (if it kills a target it won't cost mana), charge up her stun (1 stun for 5 casted spells) and finish your opponent with a combo. Recommended summoners are Flash and Ignite. * **Karthus** is everyone's nightmare. He has a low-cd bomb, an unfairly strong wall shredding the enemies defense, a nice AoE skill and An Ultimate What Will Kill You. Literally. Bring Ghost+Ignite or Flash+Ignite. Heal can be good, too, but the fact that you will stay on the battlefield for 8 seconds after your death makes you laugh at heal's face. You can build him a little more tanky - a Warmog's Armor is viable choice for him, but only after some AP. * **Nunu** is not a yeti but a little Yordle riding one. Brutal AP ratios, a passive lets you cast spells without mana and a very funny ultimate (try it in a brush, lure the enemy inside and laugh) makes him wonderful. Rylai's, Guinsoo's Rageblade and even a Spirit Visage can be useful on him. And he has a self heal. And he's melee. And he's only 450 IP. And he's lonely. Go and buy him. You can play him as a jungler, too. Going to mid with him isn't the best choice. * **Anivia** is a bird made from ice. She's cool (muahahah, that was a joke, you know, because she is made of... Ah, never mind...). She can stun you, she can build a wall and she can dance the chicken dance. Oh, and every 5 minutes, she's reborn, so you've got a free ""idon'twanttodie"" card. Requires more skill than the others from the list. * **Vladimir** is a Slav vampire (but he don't sparkle). He won't use mana for casting spells but his own health. Get him some Spell vamp (Will of the Ancients), a Spirit Visage with heath ans AP. Build him tanky.  * **Ryze** is a strange mage. He can cast his spell frequently to deal damage, but 2 of his spells have mana ratio. So the more mana you have, the more they will damage. Buy him everything with mana (Rod of Ages, Frozen Hearth, Archangel's Staff, etc). Stay away from clearly AP items (Rabadon's too). A 40% CD reduction won't hurt you either. In the end you've got a ""spell machine gun"" (¬© by Riot) who has more armor than your tank. And has 5k mana. Get him a Ghost and maybe an Ignite, too. * If you want someone who are able to support your allies, pick **Morgana**. She's a little bit difficult, but has a snare (the target can't move), a nice AoE, an anti-magic shield and an AoE ultimate with stun. And built-in spell vamp. Zhonya's Hourglass and Will of the Ancients are recommended.  There are more mages, of course, but I tried only collect the easy ones. For others, look for:  * Brand, Malzahar, Veigar, Fiddlesticks, Xerath: tons of damage, but fragile ones. * Lux, Orianna, Karma, Viktor, Zilean: strong mages who can also be supports. * Cho'Gath, Galio, Sion, Swain, Mordekaiser, Rumble, Singed: mages who can survive the apocalypse - build them tanky with AP. * Ahri, LeBlanc: very mobile, high 1v1 damage champions. * Corki, Ezreal, Gragas, Kog'maw, Nidalee, Twisted Fate: champions who benefit greatly from AP (but for most of them it isn't the most viable option).  **5+1) The different types of mages**  * **The high burst AP Carry**: This mages deals massive amount of damage in a few second, and this is their biggest advantage - but cooldowns are killing them, literally. They are excellent in 1v1, some of them (Annie, Ahri) in teamfights, too. Your main duty is to kill (or at least deal tons of damage) the enemy carry before he will rape your team. Examples: LeBlanc, Annie, Ahri, Brand. With enough AP, nearly every mage can be one of them. * **The CCasters**: They are contribute the team with not only damage but with crowd control too. Nearly every mage has some sort of CC (Annie's stun, Swain's Nevermove, Nunu's snowball), but a CCaster has at least two. Examples are Lux, Morgana, Viktor, Swain. Alistar can be built into a sucsessful CCaster. They are can also be built into support heroes. * **Melee mages**: As the name suggest, they are not ranged champions but melee ones. Thanks for this they are able to survive most things ranged ones can't. If your team don't have any tanks, you *can* build them tanky (but not in every case you *should*). Nunu, Cho'gath, Kassadin and Mordekaiser are examples for them. * **Tanky mages**: These are champions who have skills/mechanism/useful builds making them into a tanky character (but in most cases they **won't be effective as a pure tank**). For this, they can be effective off-tanks (someone, who built moderate defense but also able to deal serious damage), or (some of them) pure tanks. Cho'gath, Galio are viable as pure tanks; Ryze, Vladimir and Swain are simply tanky thanks to their builds. Vlad's passive makes him even more stronger (ap to health, health to ap). Nunu and Mordekaiser can be built into tanky (Morde's second viable build is the tanky one). Alistar, thanks to his ultimate (damage reduction) is a natural tank and have some nice AP ratios. * **The dualclass mages**: They are all have a primary build (AD carry, tank), but they can be also sucsessful as mages. It's important to know that **they are more useful with the primary build.** For this, building them into pure mages is wrong in most of the cases; a hibryd build is strongly recommended. Ezreal and Corky can be mages instead of AD carries; Amumu and Alistar are can be limited mages (they are most useful in their original builds, tank and support respectively). The original supports are useful as mages, too (Janna, Soraka, Taric, Sona). In their case, it's important to decide the right thing: do the classic build or try the AP way? In rare cases (for example your team already has a tank but you want to play Amumu) you can try it, but don't mess up a nearly perfect team comp with playing an APmumu instead a tank one. * **The omega mages**: Their name is tricky. They aren't the best mages; they are the worst (hence omega). Basically every champion who has at least one skill with AP ratios can be an omega mage, but you shouldn't play them this way (only if you want to troll games, but don't do that). But of course you can always try them in custom/coop games :) The important thing is that have fun with them **and** don't mess up the other 4 people's game. Playing an omega mage in normals/ranked mostly get you a few reports (*if you're good with them - and I mean really, really, gamebreaking, ultrafed good - they won't report you. Maybe*).  **Disclaimer**: The two lists above are basically the same - the second is more detailed. None of the list is full neither complete - putting all the mages into categories based on their abilities/possibilities would be take forever. Generally, you *can* play 85% of the champions as mages, but you *shouldn't* do that unless you know what are you doing. Really. There are dedicated mages, play them, at least until you become better. Playing Amumu as a mage is significally harder that playing him as a tank.    Now, go and play some mage, mate! And good luck with them :)  Sydius  **Changelog**  * Added new rune suggestions (thanks for PsykoDemun and treqbal) * Added a new mastery build (thanks for PsykoDemun) * Added a tip to Clarity use (thanks for everyone who support/against using it) * Added new champions into the list. * Edited Nunu with a note about going mid (thanks for U_DONT_KNOW_TEAM and BloodFlood - I never said Nunu should go mid, but I know if you read the ""most mages goes to mid"" part it suggest it) * Added a detailed list of the types of mages.",¬©

t5_2r9po,OldManPsylus,1328246671,"I'd like to add in from what other folks have said that gear of good quality for your level is designed to be easy to get. If you are someone who doesn't care one bit about the aesthetics of your character, then you will find the gear system in GW2 to be rather bland.  A good example to use is that in GW1, when you reach level 20, it is fairly easy to get gear with the maximum armor value for your class and with nearly-max power enchantments (I say near-max because some specific runes would cost more than they were worth to a fresh level 20, like the max +hps rune). ArenaNet likes this philosophy when it comes to gear, so they are applying it to GW2. The gear grind isn't for stats, it is for appearance.  Now with that big'ol speech out of the way, yes pvp and bosses/DE-bosses yield loot. The loot, however, will not be like in WoW where it will have a major stat advantage over something you'd get for a smaller event of the same level. Instead, it might have a more impressive graphical design; like an every day broadsword graphic vs. a Crazy Flaming Dragon Sword of Lightning Chickens^¬© . Just like in WoW, this is a status symbol that would tell anyone looking at you that you've achieved something more difficult. The difference is, unlike WoW, the gear is not necessarily more powerful, and thus the game doesn't slowly become freakishly imbalanced as more difficult dungeons are added.  Edit: Gear does get better as you level, but it is always easy to get good gear for your current level. Special gear tends to have a cooler cosmetic appearance without having a drastically higher stat allocation.",¬©

t5_2qh13,niczar,1328292534,"&gt; How does her lament undo the fact she chose politics over personal integrity and ethos?  1. Ambassadorship is not supposed to be a political position. Ambassadors are not elected, they are not supposed to make important decisions, they are where they are to _represent_ their country's government. As an ambassador, the only political decision you can make is to resign in protest or not. And you're not going to resign in protest unless you realize there's something to protest about.   2. She didn't choose, because she didn't even know there was a choice to make.   &gt; In the Balkans we have a saying: ""Be weary where you put your signature and your genitalia. ""  She was not signing in a personal capacity, she was not even _supposed_ to understand what she was signing, she was simply acting as the remote hand of her government in doing the signing. To drive the point further, if you sign a contract, it usually stops mattering when you die. When an ambassador signs something in his capacity as an ambassador, it doesn't matter if he dies the next second, because he signed for the country.   &gt; She should have read what she signed for.   I'm sure she did. And she didn't understand what it entailed, because being an ambassador doesn't make anyone an expert in intellectual property issues, internet governance or civil liberties.   &gt; Powell has regretted his assistance with the invasion of Iraq. Does that mean he should not be held accountable for being a key instrument in the invasion?  Did you put an extra dose of Stupid‚Ñ¢ in your coffee this morning?

t5_2qqd4,keyyek,1328320276,"My notes:  **HQ**:  Using a shadow field to protect a blaster seems like bad use of points.  **Troops**:  I don't like the warrior squads.  Splinter cannons fired from a moving raider are only going to be assault 4 (not heavy 6) and if the raider moves at cruising (6-12"") you're not getting anything out of them (though this is a constant problem for us DE.) You can dump them out to get your shots off (and some rapid fire) but 10 warriors never last long in the field.  If you're set on the poison shots, I'd put 5 warriors on a venom, hand them a blaster, and buy your venom cannon.  (for 125 pts) This is less poison shots at smaller ranges, but the blaster will give your warriors' poison shots a surprise punch.  On the other hand you will lose some poison shots when you fire your blaster at vehicles (but if you need to pop transports that's okay)  I would also try 5 warriors in a raider (so you keep your lance) and give them a blaster.  This gives you 2 darklight weapons on your platform for 120 points. (plus 4, 8 at RF poison shots, connected with the blaster)  The shredder is also a dirt cheap S6 blast that can deal some hurt to infantry and in a pinch fire at vehicles with low AV (AP - is -1 on the damage table though)    Additional note here is 5-man squads are cheaper, can still take the weapons we want, and 10-man squads don't last much longer than 5-man squads once the transport is toasted.  **Elites**:  Night shield seems like a random addition for a unit that will be at 18"" or fewer to what it's shooting at.  Otherwise, blasterborn forever. (Consider using squads of 3 to maybe squeeze in another?)  **Heavy Support**:  Ravalicious. You have Commorragh's approval here.  **Final notes**:  If you reduce points across the board you can sneak in another troop/blasterborn/ravager (or whatever else you might like)  One of the strengths of DE is the ability to bring lots of stuff on the cheap, especially for lower point levels.  So the answer to your quick question is, neither, get more.  A venom with 2 splinter cannons IS awesome, by MathHammer‚Ñ¢ standards that's 4 wounds at 36"" range.  (12 x 2/3 x 1/2)  They also have dat free flickerfield and are more resistant to some damage rolls because of having two weapons (not like that will ever come into play with AV10)  It's worth mentioning that splinter cannons are defensive weapons, therefore both can fire at cruising speed (6-12"")  Incubi are good. How you choose to fill your remaining points is up to you, and I could certainly see them being a fun addition.  That said, a singular focus is always good.  If you're entirely new to warhammer, you should read or at least skim through all the rules in the Big Rule Book (BRB) Find someone who is willing to help you through your first game's rules (I'm sure there are a few around here.)  Make sure you read and understand your rules on open-topped, skimmer, and fast vehicles since these rules define a lot of how the DE play.  Also know your fleet, drugs, and pain token rules, and keep track of them.  (some units in the dex don't have fleet, and only some have drugs)   After you've played a few games, read the BRB again and more of it will make sense and you'll remember more stuff out of it.  Keep it and your codex with you when you play and don't be afraid to check it constantly to make sure you're doing things right.  We have a [Vassal Subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/vassal40K) which is a way to play warhammer 40k over the interwebs.  You can use this to get a feel of how to play, test models and lists before you buy and paint them, and even play different armies entirely.  If you want some games to help you learn, I'd ask over there.  Oh, and welcome to reddit, hammerit, and warhammer. There aren't many DE players around here, but we're always happy to help :)",‚Ñ¢

t5_2qhnf,thenaturalmind,1328321225,"Well-said. It's really surprising how many people think there's this actual thing called the ego, on which they can dump the blame for of all of their negative thoughts, bad habits, and hurtful actions.   Like you say, ego is an activity, a process of identity creation whereby some some specific sensations are picked out of the Grand Flow‚Ñ¢ of sensations and made into a makeshift subject that is the thinker of thoughts, the feeler of feelings, the actor of actions. A careful search turns up no such self, only the *sense* of one.  Subsequently, dukkha is the uncomfortable existential friction that results when you persist in this futility, when you constantly expend energy to maintain the false split of self vs. other, when the ego-process must work to cherry-pick sensations out of the stream which can be propped up as ""I"". And of course all of the pain that goes with defending and fortifying that ""I"" at all costs, forever.  When you hear the masters say ""see things as they are"", part of that means seeing that all of the things that are supposedly ""you"" are nothing more than more flow in the stream. For example: you think and feel that ""you"" are expending effort to meditate and practice. Look closely and report the facts: really there are just the discrete sensations that make up the experience of ""applying effort"", the sensations that compose the thought that ""I"" am doing it, and a million other little sensate subtleties that flicker by so fast that they create a very convincing illusion.   Meditation is the process of transforming your default mode of perception to see that the background, foreground, self, other, in, out, external, and internal are all facets of one breathtakingly complex and unified process.

I had just had a mental breakdown the year prior, and I was failing out of college. Since my birthday is in the end of May, after finals, all my college friends had left for various parts of the country where their families were. I was not feeling particularly want-to-leave-the-houseish, so my Mom, with whom I lived, as I was a commuter to college, practically had to DRAG me out of the house to get my inaugural First Legal Drink‚Ñ¢. We went to a now-defunct mexican restaurant, she ordered me a margarita on the rocks, I took one sip of it, made a funny face and spent the next 10 minutes reassessing my life, quietly, to myself, while eating the odd chip with salsa. We paid the bill and left without ordering food.  BUT! Everything was redeemed on my 23rd birthday (Again, happy 23rd yourself!) when I was working in Vegas on a boxing television shoot, my friend and his girlfriend took me gambling at the Orleans at midnight, 3am breakfast at the Bellagio, then were my ride back home in SoCal, and we talked the entire way back. It was fantastic.   May you have EVERY birthday from now on be as awesome as that one. This one's off to a good start, I'd say. HAPPY BIRTHDAY!",‚Ñ¢

t5_2qhhn,highguy420,1328378166,"1. What are you talking about with kids contacting the plants?  It will never kill them unless you are using poisonous sprays or something, and you shouldn't do that if you are planning on smoking or eating the plant.  A ""Dumb Cane"" plant can kill your kid if they eat it and those are very common while your child could consume an entire 8' (240cm) plant on the day it is ready to harvest and not develop fatal toxicity while a few mouthfuls of other common home plants and they would be dead.    2. Home use is safe for responsible users and irresponsible users.  No matter how much they consume they will not develop acute toxicity and die.  Alcohol, aspirin, ibuprofen, multi-vitamins, heroin, tooth paste, and many other common household substances are deadly while cannabis is not.  You can use it as irresponsibly as you like and it will not kill you.  It is a harmless substance.    3. When you correct for age no driving study has ever found that marijuana use negatively effects driving ability in such a way to increase risk of accident.  Sure, it slows your reaction time a bit, but no more than other common over-the-counter and prescription drugs, including Dronabinol (Marinol‚Ñ¢, synthetic THC) which you are allowed to drive on.  Furthermore, in areas where medical marijuana dispensaries are located one study shows a measurable reduction in driving deaths as compared to other areas without dispensaries which can be attributed to a measurable decrease in liquor sales and drunk driving deaths.  So, basically, you are no more likely to get into an accident while under the influence of cannabis, and legalizing it, even in a limited medical capacity, may significantly reduce automobile-related fatalities.  In all, allowing cannabis to be unregulated will decrease motor vehicle deaths and will not increase them.  If ""middle america"" want sane and rational laws they should defer to actual scientific evidence instead of years of negative propaganda that the NHTSA's (National Highway Transportation Safety Administration) own data does not support.   As I said, it is a plant that is literally safer than peanuts.  Why do we need any laws at all to regulate it?  It is not dangerous and allowing the government the right to promulgate irrational laws undermines the authority of the law itself.  Regulating marijuana literally makes a mockery of our system of laws.  Reality does not support the prohibition.  Scientific evidence does not support the prohibition.  Rational, logical thought does not support the prohibition.  The only thing that supports prohibition is the government protecting the profitability of a few very large industries primarily concerned with synthetic chemical, pharmaceutical and materials manufacturing.  Why would we want to compromise with an illogical and corrupt position at all?  Even a little bit?  Doesn't that mean we are succumbing to corruption ourselves? ",‚Ñ¢

Is the system going to flatten you out and deny you your humanity, or are you going to be able to make use of the system to the attainment of human purposes? How do you relate to the system so that you are not compulsively serving it? It doesn't help to try to change it to accord with your system of thought.

t5_2qh1i,jschall2,1328410865,"**On hex**: First you have to understand bases:  Decimal is base ten, so there are 10 distinct digits and the places are powers of 10. So, in the number 123, the 3 is in the 10^0 place, the 2 is in the 10^1, and the 1 is in the 10^2 place. You can find the number by adding:      3√ó10^0 + 2√ó10^1 + 1√ó10^2 = 123   Hex is base 16. So there are 16 distinct digits (0-9 and then A-F) and the places are powers of 16. In computers, hex numbers are often identified with the prefix 0x. So, in the hex number 57 (0x57), the 7 is in the 16^0 place and the 5 is in the 16^1 place, and the number (in decimal) can be found by adding:      7√ó16^0 + 5√ó16^1=87  A-F just represent 10-15, so the number 0xE57 would be:      7√ó16^0 + 5√ó16^1 + 14√ó16^2 = 3671   Additionally, since 16 is 2^4, every hex digit represents exactly 4 base 2 (binary) digits. So to convert 0xE57 to binary, you can just take the 4-digit binary representations of the digits and concatenate them like so:      E=1110     5=0101     7=0111     E57=1110 0101 0111  **On the length of a text file:**  Yes and no. ASCII is only one way to encode characters. Unicode takes 2 bytes per character. But for notepad, the answer is: probably. Some caveats: it is likely that a line break is being written at the end of the file, which on Winderz is TWO characters for some ungodly reason. Every linebreak is going to take up two characters.  If you have access to a linux or unix-y machine, you can see character encoding and hexadecimal in action by piping echo to hexdump. For example:      jschall@jon-laptop:~$ echo ""I had fun once. It was awful.""|hexdump -C     00000000  49 20 68 61 64 20 66 75  6e 20 6f 6e 63 65 2e 20  |I had fun once. |     00000010  49 74 20 77 61 73 20 61  77 66 75 6c 2e 0a        |It was awful..|     0000001e  (How to read: all numbers are in hex. The first 8-character number on each line is an offset, so it's the position of the first byte/character in the line. For example, the ""I"" in ""I had..."" is at the 0th position, and the ""I"" in ""It was..."" is at the 0x01=16th position (but will actually be the 17th character, since it starts counting at 0). Then the hex digits are listed, 16 bytes per line. Then the ascii is listed. Periods are used where the byte is not in the ascii table or is an ascii control code. Note that echo outputs 0x0A at the end, which is a newline.  And here's a unicode character:      jschall@jon-laptop:~$ echo -n ‚ò† | hexdump -C     00000000  e2 98 a0                                          |...|     00000003  So the ‚ò† character is 0xE298, and ASCII 0xE2 is not representable on the screen, and neither is ASCII 0x98. The 0xA0 is again a newline.  CONSIDER YOURSELF EDUMACATED. Wait, don't. Don't trust me, experiment for yourself. Try to prove that I slipped up somewhere.",‚ò†

The issue at hand is a specific group of men.  In theory it's just a specific group, but the language here is casting a rather large net.  It begins with ""A lot of guys, and all Nice Guys‚Ñ¢,"", then later says ""Many, if not most, dudes who complain about how Nice Guys‚Ñ¢ always end up in the Friendzone are seething with resentment.""  And later on it's still all ""many"" and ""most"".  Additionally, take this:  &gt; Dude likes a lady. I mean he REALLY likes her. She likes him, but she doesn‚Äôt LIKE like him. He is banished to the Friendzone and his penis is dry forever after. What‚Äôs worse, she keeps being friends with the guy who she has betrayed (by not sucking his dick) and has the audacity to date and copulate with OTHER DUDES who are obviously inferior to our hero.  Strip it of what I called condescending tone, you called exaggerated and colorful wording, and it might be like this:  &gt; Man has feelings for a woman, who likes him, but only as friends.  He's not gonna get with her, but she still dates other men.  Which is a situation which applies to a huge portion of men at some point in their lives.

t5_2s580,GIROG,1328478312,"Dazzle is right up there with Tinker and Meepo for the spammiest hero in Dota. Because of your low cooldowns and mana costs, you're always ready for a teamfight.  But when you play Dazzle, you want to be sure you don't spam TOO much, especially in early-mid game when Shallow Grave costs more than your ultimate. Arcane Boots, Ring of Basilius, Urn of Shadows and Null Talisman will help you keep your mana in a good place.  Dazzle is extremely dependent on levels--Wave and Poison are extremely weak at rank 1, and Grave is extremely costly. But in lane, your high base damage and lovely attack animation should make up for it.    Poison Touch: This spell is incredible for chasing, escaping and teamfighting. But until rank 3, throwing a koosh‚Ñ¢ ball at your opponent has just as much of an effect. Rank this spell to 3 early on and let it stay there. I don't always put the fourth skill point in here, because all it does is give a slight increase to the DoT, amounting to 56 damage. That's about as much as an autoattack at level 1, and half as much as an autoattack at level 16. The two-second change in cooldown is the only reason you would want to go for rank 4.   Shallow Grave: At rank 1, Shallow Grave costs more mana than rank 1 of Weave. Until rank 3, it has the highest cooldown of any of your spells. It also has a shorter range than your autoattack. Like Poison Touch, you don't skill Shallow Grave because it's so good. You skill Shallow Grave because it's all but useless at low levels. The difference between level 1 and level 4 is ridiculous; the cooldown is quartered, the mana cost is lowered by 30, and the range is more than doubled. If you expect to be using Shallow Grave regularly, put more points into this spell than an apathetic weight-watcher puts into her body. It's situational, but when the situation arises, you NEED to have the spell ready to go. Just remember to heal the graved hero before the duration is over. If you don't, you're only delaying the inevitable.   Shadow Wave:  This is THE spell. With it at max level, you deal and heal up to 840 HP instantly. While the single-target heal is relatively weak, it's a massive tide-turner in a large group. It may seem like a more diluted version of Purify, but Shadow Wave has a much higher net worth. Because of its low cooldown and low mana cost, you're pretty much using Shadow Wave all day every day. Even though it's lame at low level, skilling Shadow Wave isn't as absolutely necessary as skilling your other points early on. You should be putting points into Wave when you don't need to put points into Grave or Poison.    Weave: Push button, win fight. Meshes nicely with Mekansm. You can also use it to scout an area, or to scare off potential gankers. The only time this spell is wasted is when you don't hit anyone.     Items: Standard support items. Drum, Mek, Urn, etc. Urn is extremely important because it fills the single-target-heal gap in Dazzle's spells, while giving extra mana regeneration. Don't forget to ward.",‚Ñ¢

t5_2qzb6,stroq,1328488477,"Drug war hypocrisy: drug trafficking√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s big money benefits Big Brother and corrupt banksters February 1, 2012  By PF Louis [Natural News](http://www.naturalnews.com/034832_drug_war_money_Big_Brother.html)  The hypocrisy of the war on drugs is outrageous when compared to the amount of drug trafficking that benefits the CIA and international banking system. The son of a convicted notorious mobster, John Gotti Jr, when asked in court if the family still dealt drugs cracked, ‚ÄúNo, we can‚Äôt compete with the government.‚Äù  Today in Afghanistan, American troops have been seen guarding poppy fields used to make heroin. Those fields were all but wiped out by 2001 when the Taliban destroyed them and forbade that agricultural pursuit. Now they‚Äôre flourishing again after the American occupation.  This doesn‚Äôt make sense despite all the mainstream reports that American troops are protecting the poppy farmers from the bad guys. Internet sites such as Prison Planet, Info Wars, The Political Coffeehouse and others report otherwise. They connect the CIA and US military to restarting the poppy fields in Afghanistan in 2002, increasing poppy growth by over 650 percent. Who‚Äôs telling it like it is?  One way the CIA keeps their drug trafficking hidden from public view  The CIA‚Äôs secret operations to influence journalism started in the 1950s by infiltrating the media and bribing journalists to be operatives and assets for the CIA. By 1976, then CIA director William Colby reportedly bragged that the CIA owned the press. Supposedly, this too secret to name operation was coined ‚ÄúOperation Mockingbird‚Äù by Deborah Davis in her bookKatherine the Great.  Operation Mockingbird worked well against prize winning journalist Gary Webb when his newspaper, theSan Jose Mercury News, ran his in depth series on CIA drug trafficking that flooded the USA to help finance the CIA backed Nicaraguan Contras during the 1980s.  Journalists all over the USA jumped on the series, claiming Webb‚Äôs journalism was shoddy. The newspaper had to recant and fire him, and Gary Webb was black listed from mainstream journalism completely.  Webb retaliated by having his bookDark Alliancepublished and making theNY Timesbest seller list, forcing some of his critics to privately eat crow after the fact.  Despite the CIA‚Äôs control of the press, a few Mexico and Central America cocaine busts of plane cargoes and discoveries of large cocaine stashes on crashed planes with CIA hired pilots flying them for front companies did hit the mainstream news,albeit briefly.  Remember the movie ‚ÄúAir America?‚Äù It was based on an actual CIA owned front company transporting tons of heroin from Southeast Asia‚Äôs ‚ÄúGolden Triangle‚Äù poppy fields during and after the Vietnam conflicts. Now Afghanistan and the ‚ÄúGolden Crescent‚Äù are the featured opium/heroin conduit sources.  Government and big business using drug traffic profits is nothing new  When the U.S. government made deals with the Cosa Nostra mafia to help police ports and harbors during WW II, they breathed life into the heroin trade. Eventually, Marseilles, France was set up by the Corsican mafia to become the ‚ÄúFrench Connection‚Äù for heroin traffic.  But opium trade history goes back further, to colonial times and early America. That‚Äôs when American shipping magnates used their fast Clipper Ships to compete with England‚Äôs monarch sanctioned dope running East India Company for transporting opium to China.  A few key players created family fortunes from the China opium trade that exist today within some northeast America‚Äôs ‚Äúold money‚Äù families.  Among the familiar family names, according toWikipedia(source below) is Forbes. Another source mentions Astor, a prominently wealthy philanthropic family around New York today (Wiki source below). In those days, trafficking dope was a legitimate business endeavor, immoral but not illegal.  Now it is illegal as well. Ironically, this allows the biggest illicit drug providers to financially benefit the CIA and international banking.

t5_2qhk3,C0CKPUNCHER,1328595038," Feminists often point to capital P Patriarchy as the culprit behind all sexism, all oppression of women (though they‚Äôre finally admitting that ‚Äúpatriarchy harms men too‚Äù, which is something of a victory for common sense, however small), and the ‚ÄúOthering‚Äù of women by men. The way they approach the stark reality of most of human history is from the standpoint that men somehow consciously or willfully constructed and directed femininity for their own benefit, and that women just kind of had to go along with it because they were physically weaker. They presume that masculinity developed under the influence of men alone in such a way that it became attached to characteristics of agency, like strength, action, and virility. They believe men imposed this system on women, essentially Othering women as a class, and turning even the simple partnership of marriage into a contract of servitude and oppression of women for the benefit of men. What they fail to realize is that patriarchy imposed other characteristics on men than those of agency‚Äìdisposability, utility, self-sacrifice and resource acquisition‚Äìand for the vast majority of our evolutionary past, women were the main beneficiaries and enforcers of these patriarchal gender norms.  Look at it this way. You have a rich man. This is his primary characteristic open for discussion, and he has all kinds of agency‚Äìhe has flipping great wodges of money to purchase whatever he requires, servants to do his purchasing for him, to cook his meals, clean his house, maintain his vehicles, drive him around, and because he‚Äôs wealthy he has friends and hangers on who ‚Äúbask in his glow‚Äù. Until his money is gone. And then he becomes C. Montgomery Burns on an episode of the Simpsons, unable to even dial a phone, standing in the supermarket for 15 minutes wondering if there‚Äôs a difference between ketchup and catsup. He can‚Äôt fix a doorknob. He can‚Äôt microwave a Mr. Noodles. He can‚Äôt even find his own clothes. He had agency, but it was dependent on his wealth.This is a very tempting way to live a life. It really is. If you didn‚Äôt HAVE to ever clean your own gutters or change the oil in the car or go out and risk your life killing and gutting an animal or defending your village from the assholes down the valley, why would you?Men were, in many ways, all through human history, a servant class, not a class of oppressors. This is because even in the earliest stages of human evolution, we had an instinctive understanding of the ultimate equation. 10 women + 1 man = 10 babies, and that switching the numbers around pretty much meant the end of the whole shebang for us.Dangerous work was the work of men, and it still is. Physically taxing work was the work of men, and it still is. Going out into the big bad dangerous world to get resources while women stayed safe was the work of men, and it still is. Those among our ancestors who were born without some pattern of these gender roles in their brains would have ultimately been unsuccessful wrt passing on their genes. The woman who decided to go hunt mastodon rather than staying home in the cave was much more likely to end up dying young.And as has been demonstrated through genetic research, individual women were much more successful throughout the whole of human history at passing on their genes. 80% of the females who have ever lived had children. Only 40% of the males who have ever lived have done the same.Because all those small innate gender differences feminists view as insignificant now, were generated and reinforced by one HUGE difference, and that is that females, not males, are the limiting factor in the perpetuation of any species. A human settlement survived through the toil and sacrifice (often of the lives) of its men, and through the safety of its women and children. This is simply the way things had to be throughout the majority of human evolution, and when they weren‚Äôt, natural selection selected those individuals out of the species.  ‚ô¶‚óä‚ô¶  ",‚ô¶

And if she wants to be cremated and not have her remains sit in a church for a funeral mass then there is little the other family members could do.

t5_2qhzx,Pilebsa,1328719315,"Ok, let's give this review a try...  &gt;It is impossible for me to provide you with a convincing argument for the faith I espouse, because Christianity is not a reasonable religion.   So far so good...  &gt;[Christianity] is a mountain too high, an ocean too deep, a canopy too great to be apprehended by mere human reason.  This appears to be a rephrase of the classic ""Argument From Ignorance"" fallacy.    What do we not get about Christianity or religion?  From a psychological and sociological and historical standpoint, we understand why the philosophy exists and how it propagates.  Nothing supernatural is needed in the formula to explain how it came to be, why it espouses much of its bizarre doctrine and dogma (remember these rituals originated during the bronze age and earlier, while they may seem otherworldly to us, they are not in history).  &gt;Nor is the triumph of such reason brought forth in humanism a very good lens through which to construct a world view.  A naked assertion.  Many of us would argue that humanistic views are what has created more progress for mankind than anything else.  Any researcher who has sought to cure more than himself, or any inventor who has sought to make his world better, *despite* adhering to religious ideals which say his main purpose should be little more than preparing his place in the afterlife, has embraced ""humanistic ideas"" which has benefited mankind.  What has christianity done for the human condition?  Which diseases has it cured?  Which great social and political accomplishments can be attributed to religion that far surpass the meager efforts of nontheists?  Enquiring minds want to know!  &gt;Civilian deaths attributable to atheists attempting to stamp out religion and everything else that might ennoble the individual run into the tens of millions  *aaaand here we go..* I was waiting for that.  The ridiculous, gross inaccurate sweeping generalization that anybody without your religion is vis a vie an ""agent of atheism"".  Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc fallacy.  There's no more evidence Stalin did what he did because he was atheist, than Hitler did what he did because of the shape of his mustache.  &gt;Wherever humanism has triumphed, the Grim Reaper has not been far behind.  Would you care to show me where in the ""humanist bible"" it says it's ok to murder people?   Because I can show you where it says that in your bible.  And since you're making a bullshit false equivalence, I'd like to see your evidence that humanism is some kind of militaristic fundamentalist policy.  &gt;How dependable is reason alone?  As opposed to what?   James 5:13 that says if you're sick all you need to do is pray?  Again, I ask what has faith given that has no secular counterpart has that can accomplish the same end results without requiring people the daily-added stress of having to reconcile fantasy with reality?  &gt;Reason, like time, does not exist independently, but is a function of experiences and traditions that blend to create a cultural paradigm. Experiences and traditions, like the universe, are not ‚Äústraight‚Äù ‚Äì they are ever-changing. And so reason, like time, cannot keep a steady beat.   I might agree with you on this, which could also be interpreted to suggest that morality is subjective, but then you're likely to pull a special pleading fallacy and say but your brand of doctrine is immune and non-objective.   So reason is situational but your bible transcends all that and is inerrant?    &gt;[blah blah] Then there is the Politics of Tradition, observable in the Roman Catholic Church. Tradition is the primary unit, and society is seen as a contest of traditions. Truth unfolds over time in a socially embodied experience [blah blah]  You go on identifying the myriad of different ""truths"" that each flavor of theist might seek &amp; find, in order to supposedly demonstrate how ""nothing is certain"" or that ""everything is certain and it all depends upon ones' perspective.""  But this is a bastardization of what conventional wisdom, and especially freethinkers define as ""truth.""  Which is *that which has been proven to be accurate and true*, and not simply *what someone believes.*  &gt;The unfolding of truth implies revelation, which is a core identifier of Christianity as a religion.  This needs to be foonoted as **Christian Truth‚Ñ¢**  Not unlike how your church rebranded the Winter Solstice as 'Christmas', you've also sought to rebrand 'truth' as something else that panders to your superstitious gobbly-gook.   &gt;Finally, you should be aware of the various Christian understandings of inclusion. The Christians you complain of in your book can most often be found in the Exclusivist camp.   And here we go with the ""The bad christians weren't real christians"" - No True Scotsman fallacy.  &gt;Jesus did not say, ‚ÄúBlessed are the peacekeepers.‚Äù He said, ‚ÄúBlessed are the peacemakers‚Äù (Matthew 5:9), and there is a big difference.  Yes, there is a big difference.  Some of us appreciate peacekeepers over your re-branded ""peacemakers"".  And then the rest of the review seems to be you cherry-picking data to prove Sam Harris has cherry-picked data.  What you leave out is evidence that your cherry-picking is somehow more truthful than the data which you argue against.  Extremely disingenuous.  Nothing more than a Tu Quoque fallacious argument.

Red meat and colon cancer: should we become vegetarians, or can we make meat safer? Corpet DE. Source Universit√© de Toulouse, ENVT, INRA, UMR Toxalim, Capelles, France. d.corpet@envt.fr Abstract The effect of meat consumption on cancer risk is a controversial issue. However, recent meta-analyses show that high consumers of cured meats and red meat are at increased risk of colorectal cancer. This increase is significant but modest (20-30%). Current WCRF-AICR recommendations are to eat no more than 500 g per week of red meat, and to avoid processed meat. Moreover, our studies show that beef meat and cured pork meat promote colon carcinogenesis in rats. The major promoter in meat is heme iron, via N-nitrosation or fat peroxidation. Dietary additives can suppress the toxic effects of heme iron. For instance, promotion of colon carcinogenesis in rats by cooked, nitrite-treated and oxidized high-heme cured meat was suppressed by dietary calcium and by Œ±-tocopherol, and a study in volunteers supported these protective effects in humans. These additives, and others still under study, could provide an acceptable way to prevent colorectal cancer. Copyright ¬© 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",¬©

t5_2qh0u,H3g3m0n,1328827400,"This might be better thank printing out pages of passwords: http://www.passwordcard.org/en  Personally I find the best way is to come up with a 'system' to generate passwords.  Most passwords now days are for websites. Count the number of vowels in a url, spell out the numbers as words seperated by underscore. Swap E with 3, o with 0, s with $ (and what ever other 133tsp34k takes your fancy. Swap the first 2 letters. Make the last 2 letters uppercase. Add predefined symbols after the first and third letters. Add some predefined padding thats common for all your passwords (doesn't have to be much just a few letters).  Work out what parts of the domain name are important (ie include www/com or just the middle word, some sites use things like forums.something.com, wiki.something.com, blog.something.com and othersites drop www which might make including those things a pain).  Make sure that your password is at least 8 characters for any possible input. In this case the smallest possible would be ""Two_Two"" but that's what the padding is for.  Don't use this specific system make your own ‚ò∫. Ensure your system makes use of mIxEd caps and $ymbols. Ensure your system has enough steps that reverse engineering it isn't likely. Make sure you know the order. Make sure the system is intuitive to you.  Use KeePass (or KeePassX) to store your passwords in. Sync it with dropbox there are android apps for both. Otherwise their might be a webbased password storage system but you will want to make sure its encrypted at the client end for obvious reasons. This is useful for non domain based passwords or on the off chance the site changes its domain name (del.icio.us -&gt; delicious.com).  For example:   * ""www.reddit.com""  * ""reddit"" (strip domain stuff)  * 2 vowels, 4 constants  * ""two_four"" (as words)   * ""wto_foru"" (swaped first 2 and last 2 leters)  * ""wto_foRU  * ""w!to@_foRU"" (added symbols after first and 3rd character)  * ""Padw!to@_foRU"" (final, added ""Pad"" padding to start).  The main problem with that system is the password will be the same if the numbers are the same and many sites will have similar ranges. A better solution would be to include at least part of the sites url in the password itself but only a little bit (if you just appended 'reddit' to the end it would be obvious, if you just took the 3rd and last characters then it wold be harder.). Padding might not even be necessary.  * ""dtw!to@_foRU""  Another thing is it can be a pain to type things like that, but if you use them enough you build up muscle memory and don't need the 'system'. Sites less visited you will need to reverse the system and type slowly but you don't visit those sites much so it's less of an issue.  Keep 1 or 2 low security passwords for things you just don't really care about. When you need to put them in plain text config files or have to tell people.  The only thing I haven't really worked out to well is passwords for nondomain based things. SSH boxes and so forth. You for your email do you use gmail.com (your actual address) or mail.google.com (the site you go to read the email). What about the password for my smart tv? But thats what the keepass db is for, just pick a word instead of the url generation seed and use that then look it up if your forget the word.",‚ò∫

My husband and I are currently fostering a dog for a non-profit rescue organization. Here is what they do as posted on their website. All dogs receive the following prior to adoption:  ‚ô• Distemper/Parvo Vaccine  ‚ô• Rabies Vaccination  ‚ô• Heartworm Test &amp; Treatment (if needed)  ‚ô• Spay/Neuter (no dog will ever be adopted out without being altered) ‚ô• Microchip    Adoption fee:  ‚ô• $150.00   Again I realize the adoption fee is much less but different areas have different price ranges for vet fees. Some of the organizations are better off finacially than others. I find it just a little amusing that people don't want to pay much if anything for a ""rescue dog"" but are willing to pay in upwards of $2000 to buy a pure bred. Another good reason to have a higher adoption fee is that it does help slighly in weeding out those that will not properly care for the animal (not saying it always works), but for the normal class if you spend $450 on something are you going to take care of it or toss it aside?",‚ô•

t5_2qh2p,YourFairyGodmother,1328906512,"It's because very few people would pay to get the god channel.  Let's see ... okay,   &gt;For TV programmers, the practice of bundling channels together works well. Religious and minority-oriented channels can piggyback on the popularity of the sports and news channels. This is why the Faith and Family Broadcasting Coalition, a group of the nation√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s leading religious broadcasters, opposes efforts to impose √É  la carte programming. Not enough consumers who currently subscribe to the basic-cable bundle would buy religious programming under an √É  la carte model.   &gt;All channels thus benefit from the bundling model, which allows them to access households that might not otherwise be interested in their programming. For this reason, TV programmers have signed contracts with cable companies that prohibit √É  la carte sales. Forcing the cable companies to ignore these agreements would amount to a wholesale overwriting of private contractual arrangements. Supporters of √É  la carte have failed to demonstrate a need for such dirigisme. If consumer demand for √É  la carte options is sufficiently strong, there is no structural impediment to the market√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s satisfaction of it.  &gt;Some social conservatives argue that parents should be able to buy the Disney Channel without having to let MTV√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s 24-hour sleaze-a-thon into their homes. But parents who wish to shield their children from immoral influences are not without options. They can monitor their children√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s viewing, block channels, or forgo cable (or television) altogether. We realize that the existence of these options falls short of a comprehensive solution to the difficulties of raising children in a culture that sometimes seems hostile to the enterprise. But the answer is not a mandate that would trample private contract rights and drive religious programming off the air.  Dropping cable because they carry the godbother channel doesn't impact the godbotherer's revenue stream in a negative way. In fact, it would have the __opposite__ impact because the christers wouldn't be paying to get their channel into your home but the ~~people~~ marks who send them money will still flush that cash down the heavenly toilet.   Hell, if you got a sufficient number of people to do what you propose, enough to where it was a thing, I can gaurantee the religion scam artists would cry about persecution and shit to get the suckers to send them even more money.

I am looking for a basecamp/expedition/winter camping down coat (not parka). It must have a minimum of 700-fill down. However, their must be a significant quantity of down to provide insulation for extreme temperatures by itself.

Pilgrim Jacket Women lobster: Filled with 190 g 90/10 goose down and 650 cuin fill power  Pilgrim Parka Women palau : Filled with 160 g 90/10 goose down and 650 cuin fill power (plus its a parka not really a good choice for hiking/mountaineering)  WOMEN'S KELVINATOR‚Ñ¢ JACKET : 650-fill goose down  WOMEN'S HUNKER‚Ñ¢ DOWN PARKA : 650-fill goose down  WOMEN'S NILAS‚Ñ¢ JACKET : 2012 collection : did not see it in stores and seem very light to me (might be a good choice).  *Edit : For comparison the Ambler Hooded Jacket Men black-carbon is filled with 300 g 90/10 goose down with 800 cuin fill power.  Most of these coats that I saw in stores looked like an excuse for using down and were marketed to ski/snowboard crowds and or apr√®s-ski downtown use.

AMD Eyefinity technology leverages both hardware and software. In terms of hardware, the AMD Radeon Premium and AMD Mobility Radeon‚Ñ¢ **GPUs listed above allow up to 6 displays to be driven from a single GPU**. Unlike previous products which have a maximum of two display pipelines, AMD Eyefinity technology supports up to 6 display pipelines per GPU.  In terms of software, there are several different configuration options. Traditional extended and cloned display modes are all still available, but with AMD Eyefinity technology, if the displays can support the same resolutions then they can also be stitched together into a ""single large surface"" or ""Display Group"" (as described by the AMD Catalyst Control Center‚Ñ¢ software). When a Display Group is created, it appears to the operating system and application as a single monitor with a very large resolution.](http://www.amd.com/us/products/technologies/amd-eyefinity-technology/how-to/Pages/faqs.aspx#how-tech-works)  Unless of course you are saying amd.com is wrong?   Any way I should have clarified it a bit. I was about to go to sleep when I wrote that.. From my understanding the 2 monitor deal with nvidia and ati/amd limitations were with single resolution spread across multiple monitors. Basically being able to play a game and have all the monitors show the game. As you can see above with eyefinity this can be done on a single card/gpu. I am sure Nvidia can as well to a point I will research it a bit more..   However, What I was talking about was mainly like have 2 monitors setup.. Or in the case of eyefinity and amd/ati 3 monitors setup while having others on the other ports setup for an extended desktop..   Basically speaking the limitation you speak of only applies to the limitations of spreading a single resolution across multiple monitors. But in extended desktop form you can use as many connectors as your card has. It will only play the game however on the monitor/s that you have setup as your default..   Also one other thing I messed up on and will edit my other post. I was told wrong about connecting monitors to other cards.. You can in fact do that to help spread the 2 card limitation around. However with the 7950 I am pretty sure you can connect 3 monitors to that card while still using eyefinity. ",‚Ñ¢

Or, at least, bringing a third person into the sexual relationship? If so (and you can throw all of this out of it wasn't the first time), her seeing you with another *person*-- regardless of gender-- may have made her jealous after the fact.  This doesn't explain why she cited the ""if you might be gay"" card, but we can sometimes spout things in emotional turmoil. In the sexual high of the threesome, she certainly may have enjoyed it all, but the next day her creeping thoughts may have been, ""Oh he really liked being with someone else other than me. Maybe he preferred it. Maybe I'm not good enough for him. Maybe this will lead him to cheating on me,"" etc., etc.  Just my two cents on more possibilities.

t5_2r7mh,Seele,1328988127,"I'll start with what we can agree on:  &gt;Reliability, repeatability and usefulness in predicting future events.   Yes - absolutely, well said. If it doesn't satisfy at least the first two criteria, it is not science. The third criterion I find more problematic. Scientific predictions concern the drawing out of consequences that are implicit in a theory. They may equally well account for past observations, and suggest new ones not anticipated beforehand. You cannot necessarily predict what a scientific theory will predict.    &gt;my issue with your logic is that, if the astronomical systems of Ptolemy, Newton and Einstein were sufficiently reliable, repeatable and useful, each would never have had to been adjusted, tweaked, thrown out.  Actually, that is precisely my issue with your logic. It is a formula for stasis. It provides no grounds for replacing one theory with another which explains more.  By your criteria, it would have been enough simply to continue to add ad-hoc adjustments to Ptolmey's system ad-nauseam. It need never have been replaced by a better account of reality on the grounds that it just worked. It might have become more cumbersome with each tweak to absorb any discrepancy with observation, but it would have remained compatible with your criteria of reliability, repeatability and usefulness in predicting future events. So-what if Mars ends up with a square orbit, or Venus accelerates and stalls like a learner driver, and Neptune remains undiscovered, never to be found, because every discrepancy between observation and theory can just be swept under the rug with a patch. The Microsoft Windows¬Æ theory of knowledge.  In fact, it is worse than that. Ptolmey's system was an attempt to find an explanation of reality to begin with, but your criteria are equally compatible with an astronomical system that has no concern at all for truth - you could just as easily base it on some scheme involving deities of various stature driving chariots and battling it out with other supernatural entities, all under a some kind of dome with holes cut out for the stars. A wobble in the orbit of Jupiter? Easy-peasy - Zeus had to swerve his chariot to avoid the tooth-fairy, and so on, etc, etc. Slap it on. If it works, it works.     &gt;The essence of science is also absolutely not to unify 'older ones (deep theories)'.  It absolutely is. Otherwise it is simply not worth doing. The essence of science is the desire discover, to find out - to know. All of the great advances of knowledge have the structure that older, seemingly disparate, branches of knowledge become special cases of the new, and vast new areas of discovery are opened up. There is no impetus to make such advances if your only concern is 'Reliability, repeatability and usefulness in predicting future events'. It is not enough. Again, your criteria alone, without the drive to know, are a formula for stasis.      &gt;It is to test ideas, concepts, models and theories to either continue to validate them, or to break/teak them to make them more useful and accurate at describing the universe.   Yes, that is what scientists do - with the emphasis on breaking their theories rather than validating them. If the theory breaks, it is falsified (no matter how useful it is). If the Eddington experiment had failed, Einstein was fully prepared to go back to the drawing board.     Are you prepared to give up the quest for knowledge and replace it with a kind of incurious pragmatism?   ",¬Æ

t5_2ryd5,Grammar_Buddy,1329075354,"&gt; Why do you assume that they are two different versions of the ten commandments?      It's not an assumption at all. There were some laws on the first tablets and these were not called the ""Ten Commandments"" though these are the ones commonly referred to as such (and displayed around the world). See Exodus 20. In fact, here's a nice quote about the first set:      &gt; A discrepancy not mentioned is that between the original Ten Commandments of Exodus 20 and the recap listed in Deuteronomy 5. Exodus 20 requires keeping the Sabbath because ""in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day."" But in Deuteronomy, Jews must ""remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt, and that the Lord thy God brought thee out thence through a mighty hand and by a stretched out arm: therefore the Lord thy God commanded thee to keep the sabbath [sic] day."" Nothing is said about God resting after the six days it took to create the universe.  If you read Exodus 20, however, it's very difficult to get to ""10"" total. That shouldn't be a big deal, as I said before, there's no mention of ""Ten Commandments"" anywhere in there.  When YWHW says later that **he** will re-write the laws: ""Exodus 34:1 *And the LORD said unto Moses, Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first: and I will write upon these tables the words that were in the first tables, which thou brakest.""* they **are not the same**. Some of them are very similiar, though.  **EDIT**: Exodus 34:28 is where ""ten commandments"" is found.     There is a *somewhat* common apologetic for this, though (I've only read it online and never heard it from another person IRL) which goes something like: Yes, God wrote those laws but, in Exodus 34 where it says, ""28 *And he was there with the LORD forty days and forty nights; he did neither eat bread, nor drink water. And he wrote upon the tables the words of the covenant, the ten commandments.*"" he was talking about writing those **other** ten commandments again. But why list those ten just a second ago in Exodus 34 like this familiar ditty, ""*17 Thou shalt make thee no molten gods.*""?  But I go back to this from my original question, (paraphrasing) if most of these laws are not the basis for our government (and they are demonstrably *not*) **and** our ""Christian Nation‚Ñ¢"" is absolved from following them (or any of the other LAWS), why post them? What is their significance to our country?",‚Ñ¢

t5_2qh3s,notacrackheadofficer,1329076873,"Hubert Selby's The Room is very obscene, in inventive as well as boring ways, and it too will attract readers who really shouldn't be there. Here point of view is all, as Selby ransacks the paranoid mind of a prisoner waiting to be tried, apparently on a minor charge. I say ""apparently"" because this is one of those novels that accord merely ""objective"" details very little status. The prisoner fantasizes endlessly‚Ä¶.  And Selby, who in Last Exit to Brooklyn so impressively showed his power to imagine psychosexual extremity and the lurid despairs inside seemingly commonplace souls, gives this prisoner plenty to think about, as he dreams up hideous vengeances on cops, women, and the other authority figures of his humiliating history.  But it's terribly difficult to render, from inside, dull and resourceless minds like this one. The trick is not to suggest that such people really are richly aware and sensitive when you get to know them, down there beneath the impassive, inarticulate surface. Few writers even come close‚Äîoffhand I think only of Defoe, Flaubert, and Joyce, which is select company. Selby is a conscientious craftsman‚Äîthe raw immediacy of Last Exit was sustained by a remarkable sense of structure and timing. But, like everyone else, he's no Joyce, and The Room falls short of its ambitions‚Ä¶.  The Room is powerful and disturbing even so, but the boundaries of Selby's art and moral vision are too large to be filled up by a single commonplace mind, psychopathic or not.      Thomas R. Edwards, ""The Real Thing,"" in The New York Review of Books (reprinted with permission from The New York Review of Books; ¬© 1972 by NYREV, Inc.), March 9, 1972, pp. 19-20.  Hubert Selby, you cannot fail to recall, wrote a tremendous, multi-facet book named Last Exit to Brooklyn. As you will recall with greater clarity still, that book was unsuccessfully prosecuted by some gaga weirdos whose idea of the contemporary novel begins with Jean Plaidy and ends with Penelope Mortimer (bless their nylons)‚Ä¶.  However, despite all the rape, bestiality, brutal sadism, mutilations and manglings, no one could read this novel [The Room, Selby's second book] without knowing that they have been through a strange and harrowing trip of unimaginable pathos. Not despite the untempered psychotic violence of the work but because of it‚Ä¶.  Although Selby's writing assumes many textures, from sequential exposition to raging curses relentlessly smeared on with a palette knife, the book itself is both organic and indivisible. It is considerably more than its parts. It is a soul stripped bare, flinching and wincing and screaming and bleeding and struggling for breath. Scarcely a let-up, with very few moments of even recollected delight. Not a happy book but an unavoidable one. Maybe even a great one.

t5_2qpp6,Daunteh,1329091284,"As a mid masters Protoss player who likes to play new maps, I've played around 50 games on this map now. These are my thoughts on the different matchups:  PvZ: Obvious FFE map, plenty of places to sneak out probes and hide pylons if you want to go for a +1 zealot timing. Zerg have to be extremely active with his lings if he wants to be 100% safe. Even so, you can push out with a one or two zealots to make way for your probe(s). Clearing Xel'Naga towers is very important, as it will keep Zerg on his toes as he'll have a harder time spotting any pushes coming, and especially, it can hide your Void Rays and Phoenixes until they arrive at his potential 3rd.  If the Zerg decides to go for an early 3rd, a +1 Zealot/SG timing can be very effective as the distance between natural and 3rd for zerg is quite long, so by the time your timing attack hits, he shouldn't be able to have gotten creep connected between the hatches. This means that it takes ages for his Queens to move between bases, and the funny thing here, is that the air distance between his 3rd and his main is extremely short, so if he brings over a lot of Queens to his third, you might be able to do a lot of damage by quickly swooping into his main.  When you decide to take your 3rd base, I'd really advice leaving a Sentry or two at the ramp by your natural, as it's only 1 FF wide before rocks are destroyed. Meanwhile you should be walling the ramp at your 3rd. I wouldn't invest too much into the wall to the side of your 3rd, unless you are powering up with Gateways anyway. I generally like to just wall off with mostly pylons, as proper scouting should be enough to spot a runby (obs, spotter pylons/probes, hallu).  When it comes to walling at your 4th/5th bases, I actually disagree with dApollo (still ‚ô• you). At that time, you should have sufficient means to have almost complete map awareness, so spotting his main army shouldn't be too hard.  if you see his army moving, your army will move accordingly. While ling runbys seem like a nice way of harassing, this isn't the only (or even the most effective) way of harassment at this stage of the game. Far more devastating tactics include Muta harass, Roach drops, Baneling drops and burrowed infestors. So I'd rather just plant down pylons and lots of cannons hugging your Nexus, as they deal with all those kinds of harrassment, instead of just ling runbys. If you see his army moving, your army will move accordingly. While ling runbys seem like a nice way of harassing, this isn't the only (or even the most effective) way of harassment at this stage of the game. Far more devastating tactics include Muta harass, Roach drops, Baneling drops and burrowed Infestors. So I'd rather just plant down pylons and lots of cannons hugging your Nexus, as they deal with all those kinds of harrassment (or at the very least buys you time to get some units over there), instead of just ling runbys. Also one HT with high energy at each vulnerable base can be very useful, if you're playing versus a very harass oriented Zerg.  I'd also advice getting the bases that leads to you having to move your army as short distances as possible, and with as few attack routes as possible.  For your own late-game harass, I would definitely recommend DT, as there are so many paths for them to take while going unnoticed (It's not like Shakuras, where a spore in the middle denies any DT tactics unless you use Warp Prism or some hidden pylon shenanigans), and with the distances between bases + multipe options for 4th/5th/6th bases, you can often deny building Hatches and even get away with the DT(s) before Overseers arrives.  General army composition favours Colossus rather than HT, as there are just so many chokes to FF which makes it easy to get into a nice position with your army. The map also discourages Muta play, because of how the first 3 bases are laid out, so Robo should be way safer than templar tech. All the various cliffs also favours Colossus because of their mobility with cliff walking and their huge range. Combined with Blink and Sentries for FF, I think this will be the obvious choice for most Protosses on this map.  Feel free to agree/disagree with me, and add your thoughts to the thread.

Gabe Newell: We‚Äôve been around for a long time and there‚Äôs always this assumption that videogames are a zero sum game; that if Quake does really well, Duke Nukem will suffer, and that‚Äôs never the case. Gamers who play a good game want to play more games, not fewer games. So you‚Äôre never hurt by the success of another games developer ‚Äì you almost always benefit.  You know, when Zynga go out and gets 100 million people playing one of their games in two months, I think every game developer is benefiting. Not everyone should throw in the towel and say: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been defeated.‚Äù  Now DOTA is not a genre anymore, it is a name part of the ""action RTS"" genre. Also he basically calls Riot games and Blizzard for being the same as Zynga lol  Anyway, you can always use Neogaf that is not just another shitty forums, they post sources on there. Also Google can find stuff.  ",¬©

Originally invented by King Camp Gillette in 1904 the open comb was the original design for the safety razor head. Now recommended for shavers with a particularity heavy or coarse beard, as the comb can catch awkward hairs easier or with less passes than the straight bar razors. Thought to be more aggressive the blade is just exposed between the combs so easier to nick yourself if you apply any pressure. This being said it's possible to achieve a great shave no matter your beard / skin type with any head design it's just an open comb does work very well on thick or coarse beards.  **3-Piece** - The handle, comb &amp; top come as separate pieces &amp; screw together.   * These models are light weight so have a more even balance, where as the 2-piece are weighted at the handle end.    * More manoeuvrable &amp; less aggressive than the 2-piece.   * Available in 3"" or 4 "" long handled models.  3""    [15C](http://www.fendrihan.com/images/MRK15C-2.jpg)   [41 (aka 1904/1906)](http://www.italianbarber.com/images/merkur-41c.jpg)  [985CL (travel, 2 piece handle)](http://connaughtshaving.com/_wp_generated/wpf97d27f4_05.jpg)  4""   [25C](http://www.pampered.com/assets/images/pics/HR_401-019-00_Merkur_25C.jpg)    **2-Piece** - The comb bar is fixed to the handle    * These models are heavier so can provide a more aggressive shave than the 3-piece.   * Thicker handle than the three piece which some find more comfortable to hold.   * Available in 3"" or 4 "" long handled models.  3""     [11C](http://straightrazorplace.com/attachments/razors/84817d1323602510-de-selection-help-merkur-11c-open-comb-de-razor.jpg)  4""   [12C](http://www.fendrihan.com/images/MRK12C-4.jpg)  **Slant Head (closed comb)**  The most aggressive of the fixed head razors but with a reputation of being fierce which is not really deserved.

It's called TSA Pre‚úì, and if you haven't heard of that yet, it's a load of shit.  Taken from [Tsa.Gov](http://www.tsa.gov/what_we_do/howitworks.shtm):  If TSA determines a passenger is eligible for expedited screening, information is embedded in the barcode of the passenger‚Äôs boarding pass. TSA reads the barcode at designated checkpoints and the passenger may be referred to a lane where they will undergo expedited screening, which could include no longer removing the following items:      Shoes     3-1-1 compliant bag from carry-on     Laptop from bag     Light outerwear/jacket     Belt  Note that in all likelihood, you will still be going through the cancer scanner, and patted down when it inevitably false-positives on you. Since you're allowed to keep your belt on, they won't let you go through the metal detector since it would end up beeping anyway. This is a guaranteed trip through the cancer scanner.  Not elated yet? It gets better:  TSA will always incorporate random and unpredictable security measures throughout the airport and no individual will be guaranteed expedited screening.  So, this sounds great! How do I sign up? Read on:  TSA Pre‚úì‚Ñ¢ includes U.S. citizens who are members of existing Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Trusted Traveler programs including Global Entry, NEXUS, and SENTRI programs as well as eligible airline frequent flyers.  So, if you've already cleared yourself with CBP, all you have to do is hand over all of your background reviews and personal information to the TSA, and they'll let you through without taking your shoes and belt off, woo-hoo. Except they don't. I've heard lots of stories in the TSA blog comments from people that are in this program saying the TSA agents at their airport had never even heard of this program.  So, let's summarize: After you hand over all of your personal information and background-checks to the TSA, they will ignore the program and send you through with the rest of the sheep. If by stroke of luck they actually know about this program, they will still send you through the cancer machine, and when it signals you because of the belt, jacket and shoes that you are ""allowed"" to keep on, they will pat you down.

For centuries (millennia even) before the theory of genetics breed we were manipulating animals and crops to best serve our own needs. A cow today looks very different from a cow four hundred years ago, same thing with dogs and wheat, rye, potatoes and so on. Darwin also mentions that humans have modified the traits of doves to better suit the breeders' needs.  The last century though we have started to take things past the microscopic level to cut down on the time necessary to introduce the desired changes, this is somewhat uncharted territory for everyone that is not familiar with a laboratory environment.  This direct, as opposed to the indirect genetic modification we used to do has probably been given a bad rap by reprehensible companies such as Monsanto.

Though if you're in the public eye, its very difficult to keep things quiet or else there is speculation and rumors start about everything.   About two years ago on a Matt Bomer Facebook fanpage, someone had uploaded those 'leaked' pictures of him when he was younger and kissing a guy. There were some people who were vehemently denying that those pictures were of him, saying the eyes weren't the right color or his ears weren't the same, with a few people saying that there's no way Matt can be gay, gay men can't act as straight men, etc. Even after people pointed out that Matt has kids with another guy, some people would continue to deny that he was gay, and a few even spouted off slurs.

t5_2qh16,mikeakasleeper,1329192587,"The trucks you drive next to on the highway might soon get heavier. A bill in Congress called the Safe and Efficient Transportation Act would allow the maximum weight on commercial trucks to increase from 80,000 pounds to 97,000 pounds on federal highways.  Many in the trucking industry said raising the weight limit would move more goods, which meant fewer trucks on the roads.  ‚ÄúWhen we talk about emissions, cutting down on emissions that way, when we talk about congestion, clearly an issue we are not only dealing with today but also in the very near and distant future,‚Äù said John Esparza, president of the Texas Motor Transportation Association.  However, Esparza said many at his association were worried about safety on the road. The Truck Safety Coalition felt the same way.  ‚ÄúWe say, ‚ÄòThey‚Äôre big enough already, they‚Äôre heavy enough already, they‚Äôre killing enough people already. Let‚Äôs stop it. Let‚Äôs reduce the severity of these crashes instead of increase the severity of these crashes,‚Äù said Jeff Burns with the Truck Safety Coalition.  James Harrell is a truck driver in the Metroplex, and he said no matter how heavy a truck might be, safety on the road came down to who was behind the wheel.  ‚ÄúLook at the problems we got now. And it‚Äôs got nothing to do with the amount of weight we carry, and it‚Äôs mostly, 90 percent driver,‚Äù Harrell told CW 33 News.  Another concern about the weight limit change was road damage. Stefan Romanoschi is an expert on pavement design and materials at the University of Texas at Arlington, and he said a weight increase would affect the life of a highway.  ‚ÄúIt means that the road that is designed to last 20 years, it will last probably 18 years. So you are looking at an increase in maintenance and rehabilitation costs probably around 10 to 25 percent at least,‚Äù said Romanoschi.  If the new bill became a law, trucks could only go to the 97,000 pound weight limit if they had a sixth axle. Most trucks have five axles.  ‚ÄúWhen you add that sixth axle, you‚Äôre dispersing the weight more appropriately across those axles, and there is a difference between overloaded and overweight,‚Äù said Esparza.  Some who are for the weight increase also said it might lower prices for consumers, but Esparza believed with the increase in diesel and other costs, people might not see a price drop.  The Texas Motor Transportation Association met in Austin, Texas this week to decide whether or not they supported the bill, which has become a hot topic within the trucking community.  Emerald Technology Partners is determined to provide solutions to the problems facing the refrigerated trucking industry as well as consumers. Some of the problems are the struggles to save money transporting goods across the country, reducing consumer food costs, and reducing emissions.  The Wedway‚Ñ¢ Refrigeration Power System is a solution to all of these problems.",‚Ñ¢

t5_2r0gj,jpndoc,1329202898,"I saw this right before I stopped believing in the church and it kind of started me on my quest for the truth. I saw it in Nauvoo with the rest of my singles ward and everyone was weeping and exclaiming how they felt the spirit so strong and yet I felt nothing. All I saw was a whitewashed history with a lot of manipulation created by swelling music and fancy cinematography. I like how they portray how inclusive Joseph Smith was to black people. As if that is supposed to erase the fact that later Brigham Young began the racist policy of denying priesthood and temple ordinances to Black church members. Church films like this one are created to manipulate the emotions of members or church investigators so that they feel something which they would identify as ""feeling the spirit."" It's all part of what Bonneville Communications, the church's production company, calls ‚ÄúHeartSell‚Äù¬Æ. According the their website http://www.bonneville.com/?nid=32 , ""Our unique strength is the ability to touch the hearts and minds of our audiences, evoking first feeling, then thought and, finally, action. We call this uniquely powerful brand of creative ""HeartSell""¬Æ - strategic emotional advertising that stimulates response."" They tell members and investigators that this emotion is confirmation that what they are seeing is true and is of God.....Bullshit. Well, they don't say that last part...I added that in.   Our emotions are not good barometers for truth. I remember how I would sometimes feel emotional while hearing a church hymn or listening to an impassioned sermon from a seminary teacher or institute teacher. I also felt this same emotion even stronger when I was dancing in a moshpit and singing along while my  favorite hardcore punk band played on the stage. I was always happier and more blissful singing in the moshpit than singing at church. That dichotomy was always confusing to me.",¬Æ

The easiest way to stop supporting bottled water, is to stop buying bottled water! And the easiest way to stop buying bottled water, is to purchase a reusable water bottle!  &gt;The New York Times states that the average American consumer spends nearly $1,400 a year on bottled water. If these consumers drank the same amount of water, but obtained it from their kitchen faucet instead, they would have spent only $0.49 in the same year!  &gt;When faced with these numbers, it is an easy decision to purchase a reusable water bottle. But which one to choose? There are so many reusable water bottles on the market from aluminum, to glass, to BPA-free polycarbonate plastic bottles. These reusable bottles will often crack, dent, and break fairly easily. Furthermore, NONE of these options are biodegradable! The Hemp Bottle will be more durable than these options as well as being completely biodegradable, providing an easy choice for consumers. Industrial hemp grows in abundance in many parts of the world and produces the STRONGEST natural fiber known to man. Additionally, hemp requires little to no pesticides to grow, making it a very environmentally friendly organism. Hemp is an extremely impressive plant with many people claiming that it has over 1,000 uses.  From their website.

With no formal voice training or money to do so, I relied on deepstealth, CandyFLA, and a few others who posted on Youtube. Every day I trained and recorded my results, and it all paid off. I haven't been mistaken as a male by voice for over a year now. I even had relationships where they had no idea I was MtF until I confided in them.  So a huge thank you to Calpernia, Andrea, and the few others like you. You all inspired me and had a magnificent impact on my life.

t5_2r94o,funkitin,1329274092,"Thanks for posting this!  During my days working as an admissions advisor I saw way too many families get duped by this site.  Most heartbreaking story was this one very sweet girl sharing with me how she didn't understand why our school had not received her FAFSA results as she had  submitted her $65 processing fee when she completed her application.. and she had to wait two months for her grandmother to have the extra money from her SSI check..(her legal guardian as mom and dad were both terrible meth addicts).  They were very very low income and barely getting by and aside from that she busted her ass to scrape together her $100 application for the school. We all sat at my desk together and I showed them the FAFSA.ed.gov website and told her that the government does not charge you to apply for Financial Aid, as FAFSA stands for **FREE Application for Student Aid**. She felt horrible for losing the money from her grandma and started crying uncontrollably. Then grandma teared up and asked if I could help them get the money back. I called and emailed and all sorts of things... but nothing. It was horrible.   FAFSA is a FREE application on a government run website.. hence then.. stay away from .coms.. they're merely scammers.... The government isn't going to charge you to give you money for school upfront... they have all that delicious interest to squeeze out of you when you get the  Stafford/Perkins loan..   Anywho.. that particular girl did end up getting a scholarship to another school and didn't even ultimately end up using any government funds...   Edited to add a spicy ranty wall of text:  OMG, I just analyzed their website again as I hadn't seen it in quite some time..... WHAT A GODDAMNED RIPOFF.. Fuck everything about this company.   I've taken this from their website and added my commentary... they are basically taking advantage of some ill informed consumers gullability:   **Our Services:  Student Financial Aid Services, Inc. is a fee-based preparation and advisory company dedicated to helping America‚Äôs families access the most federal and state financial aid possible to pursue their college dreams. Our website is www.FAFSA.com.**    *Seriously.. most colleges that you are applying to have a financial aid department that are more than happy to answer your questions.  Even if you haven't applied to the college you can usually wander into the FA department of a community college and they'll assist you as much as they can and answer your questions! If not, you can always call the FAFSA.ed.gov people.. they are VERY helpful and will answer your questions free of charge*    **Many people call our Student Aid Advisors for personal advice because they want peace of mind that their form is accurate and their chances for aid are the best they can be.**   *Seriously, what chances?  It is SO hard NOT to qualify for Financial Aid.  You're chances are i'd say like 98% that if you apply you will get some sort of Financial Aid.  Those who don't are: In default on a previous financial aid loan from the government... not US Citizens...are dependents who did not get their legal guardian to provide their information or tax information... males who did not register for selective service... or individuals who did not file their taxes for past years, or the year they are applying for.  It is a piece of cake to qualify for Financial Aidd Stafford/Perkins Loan... What you MAY NOT QUALIFY FOR is a PELL GRANT. And the government decides if yuou are needy enough to receive that.  PERIOD. No advice from company can INCREASE your chances at all. Geeze.... COME ON! The federal government has made completing the FAFSA pretty foolproof, it is actually very difficult to provide false information on it. A lot of questions require additional documentation in order to substantiate the claims, also, a great deal of FAFSA's are taken through a ""verification process"" to ensure all information is correct.  Also the amount you receive in Federal Aid is a SET AMOUNT. Everyone receives the same amount based on the number of years they have been in school (1st year, 2nd year, 3rd year, MBA).  Just grab your taxes and answer the questions on the FAFSA. They're very easy. Even with your taxes the FAFSA website tells you exactly what line of your tax docs to look at to ensure you are answering the question correctly....*    **We simplify filling out the government‚Äôs complex aid application. We review your FAFSA personally using our 450-point FAFSACheck‚Ñ¢ error detector.** *Okay, now I'm just getting really angry... WTF is an ""error detector"" and how does it work?  How is it possible that they access your FAFSA application with the government?  The only way to get access to your REAL FAFSA is by logging into the FAFSA.ed.gov website and logging in with your username and your four digit PIN number.  Your four digit PIN number is as valuable as your Social Security Number and you are told on the FAFSA.ed.gov website never to give it out TO ANYONE. (Yes, I've had a ton of students try to give me their PINS).  When you submit your FAFSA to a school by adding the school code, the Financial Aid office of that school will catch any erroneous errors and help you to correct them (the schools ability to maintain funding from the government highly depends upon it..). And they do this by having legitimate access to your FAFSA once you add the Schools Code.*  **Our two convenient options are FAFSALive‚Ñ¢ and ExpressFAFSA‚Ñ¢.**   *What the hell is an Express FAFSA? The FAFSA is going to take you 30-45 minutes to complete PERIOD. There's no other way around completing a legitimate FAFSA.*  **Choose FAFSALive‚Ñ¢ by calling our trained Student Aid Advisors, who in typically 15 to 20 minutes will walk you through a simplified process, check for accuracy, and file your application electronically. We help college students maximize their eligibility for financial aid. Call us at 1.866.550.5120.**   *DO NOT PAY A COMPANY TO COMPLETE A FREE APPLICATION... The federal government and the FAFSA.EDU website is very helpful. And bullshit on the eligibility for financial aid.  I shall repeat it is hard NOT to qualify for financial aid.. just do these things:*  -Be breathing  -Be a US Citizen  -Make sure you are applying to an Accredited School  -File your taxes (or make sure your parents have filed)  -Register for Selective Service if you are a male  -Do not have previously been on Financial Aid in school and got busted for a drug charge while on Financial Aid  -Do not be in default on any previous Financial Aid you received  Congratulations!  You qualify for Financial Aid!  Now again... the PELL Grant.. is free money, and The Government uses their own set of factors to determine who will get that (typically if you complete your FAFSA and see that your EFC - Expected Family Contribution is ""0"" or pretty damn close to it...your chances of getting a PELL Grant are usually pretty damn high... because that means the government thinks you and your family are ""pretty damn broke"", so you'll get some extra cash that you don't have to pay back.     So if this bullshit company tries to tell you that you did not QUALIFY for Financial Aid.. That is what you more than likely didn't qualify for the PELL GRANT.    http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/ Is the only site you need.  Or hell.. just PM me.  I've still got ""connections"" with way to many FA reps at three different schools who I harass constantly for my step daughters who are now in college with questions and what not..  /RANT  I need a drink now.

Even the shows I feel lesser about like The Looney Tunes Show, Johnny Test, Fanboy and ChumChum, or The World of Gumball are fairly advanced in their plots and don't really condescend, often getting rather meta with most jokes. Even shows designed solely to educate young minds like Martha Speaks or Word Girl show immense amounts of wit and cleverness, not seeming to limit themselves.""*  The difference is that most of those shows are aimed at an older audience of kids, maybe 8-12. Query that range, and most would say they'd stay away from MLP:FiM, which is aimed at 4-8, and specifically *girls* at that. Big difference between early elementary and late elementary. That's two double-whammies that could have held MLP:FiM back, but didn't as much as most people expected it to. Within those limitations, it typically does admirably.  Besides, you still underestimate the Power of Cute‚Ñ¢. I'd argue that MLP is cuter than all of those shows. Combined. There's just this *gorram irresistible charm*  And perhaps some people just appreciate that the show has a very lighthearted, non-cynical sense of humor. Adventure Time can get pretty morbid with its humor, and there's a *lot* in there that I wouldn't want to see in FiM.  &gt;""*You see, when I went into MLP I expected wit. I went in thinking Twilight would be this sardonic snarker that kept mostly to herself and would be the one sane man, the straight man, the tsukkomi that the crazy saccharine world would bounce off of. I thought that she would be forced to be with this group of sweety oddballs because friendship literally was magic and in order to have the power to fight evil (whether they liked it or not) they would all have to be friends. And although she would hate it at first, this garish candyland and it's oddly sweet inhabitants would grow on her and they would form a real friendship over time.*""  I feel like this kind of character development could only really be offered to any significant degree by a show with a chronology over time. In MLP, there's virtually no chronology at all; it's completely episodic.   I'd have liked for Twilight to be a little snarkier too--and hell, sometimes she *is* snarky and it's great (the way she says ""...Tom?"" to Rarity is just so damn classic)--but remember, this is a *really* little kids' show. I'm pretty sure they keep a lot of the more damning personality quirks off the air when it can become a bad influence.  &gt;""*I expected something clever, something that subverted the ""saccharine"" feel of kiddie shows while pastiching the old 80's shows like Strawberry Shortcake and Care Bears. I expected something like the PowerPuff Girls, where the fact that they were little girls took a backseat to the fact that they were superheroes and they could be so clever as to have an entire episode of just Beatles puns. But alas, the pilot was so standard and provided none of the snappy writing or tongue-in-cheek subversion I expected.*""  Alright, the point at which you mention the pilot is the point at which I mention that I fell asleep during the pilot. I *hated* the pilot. It bored me to tears, and any time I wasn't falling asleep, my face was in my palm. I think the only time it elicited even a chuckle out of me was when Rarity and Twilight groaned as Pinkie started singing.  I was seriously considering not finishing the series after that point.  Also, that linked PPG episode just made me nostalgia pretty hard. Hopefully we get an MLP episode like that‚Ä¶ :x  &gt;""*I also understand the insane undertaking such a project would entail, but honestly, it seems like there are so many fans that are artists that the project would lift itself, but I suppose it's a little pie-in-the-sky.""*  All I can think of is total conversion mods for games and how they sometimes take years, maybe even a decade, to come out. And how, more often than not, they fall apart before they can produce any viable results. I've been part of modding communities before, and even the smallest mods can take bloody forever to produce results.  &gt;""*Overall, I feel that the show isn't reaching its potential. There are plenty of shows out there that display all of the elements I want MLP:FiM to embrace.*""  I agree on this point. Hopefully the actual show will get better (and I feel like some of the episodes *are* getting better than last season), but until then, that's what the fandom is for.

People mess up the [meaning of tolerance](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/tolerance) all the time. They claim that making fun of something is intolerant. No it isn't. Intolerance would be beating them up, driving them out of town, forming lynch mobs or bullying them. Making fun of a stupid idea is none of those things. I can respect someone's right to believe. I can respect them as a person. But I can also laugh in their faces when they say magic is real. It may be rude, it's not intolerant.   You could make the analogy that I'm making fun of a gay kid, for example, but that's not the same thing. For one, unless someone is being rude or simply refusing to acknowledge any points, I try not to talk about the person. I talk about their claims. I'd being making jokes about gay sex, not the kid himself. Beyond that, if someone says that they have a pet dragon, but when pressed, can't provide any evidence or arguments that are valid, it's not intolerance to laugh, because they've made a ridiculous claim that there's no reason to think is true. It'd be me laughing when the gay kid says the he has sex while orbiting the moon.   Ridiculous claims are deserving of ridicule. Mocking a bad claim isn't the same as mocking a person. I can hate religion in general, but not have any problems with the people who are a part of that religion. Intolerance would be attacking the people solely because they're religious. Making fun of bad ideas isn't attacking someone.   &gt;The people of this subreddit act like immature children   Oh. Well, sure, a lot of people here do act like brats. I thought you meant we should be nice, just because. I'm all for more grown-up discussion. I like to, if not be reasonable, at least try to be thoughtful in my responses. I not always am. Sometimes I'm childish too. Sometimes I don't pay enough attention. Sometimes I'm an asshole. I agree we should grow up some, so I'm trying to be grown up. Lead by example. You should too. We'll downvote the crap and upvote the good stuff.   But, there are a few points I just remembered that I wanted to make. I'm not trying to excuse bad behavior, just putting this into perspective. I'm not sure where you live, or what you believe. Here in the US, ""atheist"" is a dirty word. Last election cycle, a few of my state politicians would attack someone else in a campaign commercial by saying they have ties to atheists. (Things have gotten a little better since then, some things have gotten worse.) There are some towns in the southern states where you're either a True Christian‚Ñ¢, or you're a leper. Even Christians of slightly different flavors are looked down on, to say nothing of Muslims, Jews, or (gasp) heathen god deniers. This is a country churches get public money, but pay none back, where state after state removes or bans peoples rights (gay marriage, abortion, contraception, etc.) purely on religious grounds, where some people have to hide themselves from their families and co-workers, where congressmen can deny science publicly because they claim their god promise never to flood the Earth again.   My country is fucked up, and people come here to vent, to cry, to be outraged and find support. For lots of atheists, this forum is their only connection to like-minded people. So there's a lot of built-up frustrations that get vented here.   Like I said, I don't mean to excuse assholes or childishness, just trying to explain why it might be there.   The sheer number of trolls and repetitive ignorance from people posting doesn't help the situation any, honestly. Having five posts a day asking how anyone can love (be human) without a god is annoying.",‚Ñ¢

So hey, why not, right? :-)   The Greatest Show On Earth is absolutely fantastic, and though I don't like Dawkins as an ""atheist apologist"" for lack of a better word, he is a fantastic biology teacher and I strongly recommend you pick that up.  If you like to watch videos, here's some that really helped me:  [Evolution](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vss1VKN2rf8) by Qualiasoup gave me a concise and accurate overview of evolution. [His whole channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/qualiasoup/#g/u) is filled to the brim with videos that are so clear, well laid out and simple, they absolutely transformed the way I viewed the world.  Also check out the channel of QualiaSoup's brother, [TheraminTrees](http://www.youtube.com/user/TheraminTrees/videos). He's a bit more creative, but clearly follows the same style.  If you have an afternoon to spare, check out [these video series](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA0C3C1D163BE880A&amp;feature=plcp) by Evid3nc3. It's an in-depth story about how he turned from a True Christian¬Æ to an atheist and what stages he went through. It's very personal and very recognizable at times - it actually made me cry. Well worth watching and you'll learn a lot about the bible's background in the process.

Book-wise I recommend anything by Bart Ehrmann, a New Testament scholar. If you're an avid reader, there's this book called A History of God by Karen Armstrong which lays out the history of the Judeo-Christian god. It's *very* information-dense so you'll probably read only a few pages at a time and feel absolutely knackered afterwards. Nevertheless, insanely interesting and an absolute mindfuck.

Very funny:  http://donkehote.weebly.com/how-i-learned-to-never-barter-for-landscaping.html   At the height of the real estate bubble, I bought a rental house in Avondale, Az in the summer of 2006, and the backyard was just bare dirt. The first month-to-month tenants I had were a young couple that offered to install grass in the back in exchange for a portion off the first month's rent, as they had a friend in the business who had several rolls of Bobsod‚Ñ¢ from a lawn install where the customer didn't pay. They knew all the lingo, so I believed them when they swore they had installed lawns professionally in the past, so it seemed like a fair deal.  They laid it down and two months later they said they were getting divorced and had to move out ASAP. They paid their rent, but the lawn looked a bit wonky. I thought about making it an issue, but they were an emotional mess, so I just let them go. Unfortunately, they took the above ground hose sprinklers I had bought until I could afford an in-ground system, so while I was searching for new renters I set up another couple of sprinklers with a timer and had the place cleaned by a three lady crew. A month later another married couple named Jim and Karen needed a month-to-month deal while their new house was getting built, so I agreed. They moved in on a Saturday.  That Monday night I get an email from her husband, asking me to send over an exterminator. I called his cell, and he said he's seen a few roaches, so I said *""sure, no problem.""*. I called it in and they tell me the guy is scheduled to go the next afternoon. Wednesday morning I go by the house to drop off a welcome basket of coffee and chocolates (I was a fresh new landlord) and Karen welcomes me in. Tells me she's glad to see me, and asks ""Did my husband tell you what happened with the roaches?""  I said, *""Umm, he mentioned he'd seen a few, so I called the exterminator. Did the guy come by yesterday?""*  She shook her head. *""Yeah the guy came by, but that's Jim. He's always downplays everything.""*  I asked her what happened.   *""Well, this guy Mike came from (the exterminating company) and he was a big biker guy. Tattoos all over him. He was a little scary looking so I told him to go around to the back yard, that's where the roaches are. I was watching from the arcadia door. He's got this big canister he's carrying with a long metal wand. So he starts going around the yard with this wand, spraying the top of it, when he leans over and sticks the wand into a big crack in the lawn. You know, whoever put your lawn in did a really bad job of it... anyway, he starts pumping that canister with one hand and he's got the wand stuck in the ground up to his hand, and that thing was like two foot long so I don't know how deep it was. So then, it was like biblical, something out of a movie... this like, FUNNEL CLOUD of roaches like, shoots out of the ground straight up in the air over his head and then flattens out like a mushroom over him. He starts screaming and spraying that wand everywhere around wild, like it's a sword or something, and those roaches are biting him and swarming all around him. Did I tell you this guy was a huge biker? Screaming like he was on fire. I was scared too, and I was behind the arcadia door. Those roaches were flowing out of the ground in all directions, running from that poison he pumped in there, and what wasn't after him was crawling up the walls of the block fence in sheets, and going over the sides. So he drops his wand thingie and he's running all around the yard, freaking out trying to brush off all the roaches and he sees me through the glass. He starts running toward me and I know he wants in but NO WAY, I'm not opening the door, so I lock it real quick. He starts begging me to open the door and let him in. I yelled at him to go 'round the front but he's not going, he's just dancing around the patio like a crazy person hitting himself all over. He starts begging again, so I told him ok, I'm gonna open it up just enough for you to get in, but don't let none a them bugs in with you. He says okay, and I go okay, on three, right? So I count to three and flip up the lock and he busts in and shuts it super quick. He's still got roaches on him so I grab the little rug I keep in front of the sink and start slapping them off him. He's beating himself, and I'm beating him with the rug 'till we got all the roaches we could see off him and on the floor. His eyes are still like, huge and then he rips his shirt off and he's got 'em inside... it was sooo gross. I beat those off of him too. We start stomping them and when we're done we both kinda looked at each other and he's all out of breath but he was just like ""holy shiiiit, that was crazy!"". So he helped me clean up all the roach parts and then he got another canister out of the truck and sprayed in here, top to bottom. I've never seen anything like that. Why didn't you tell us this place had roaches?""*  I was stunned. I said I had no idea the place was infested - I just bought it and did a termite inspection and the exterminator never mentioned anything. I told her that was quite a story, and that it was strange her husband didn't say anything if there was that big of a problem. I asked her if they had seen any more than the few he said he saw.  *""Oh we didn't see any in the house but a couple in the kitchen sink. It was when Jim turned on the back porch light. He called me over to look out. The whole yard was moving in waves like the ocean, from one wall to the other. We got the flashlight and shined it out there, and that's when we saw they were roaches, like hundreds of thousands of them. That's when he turned off the porch light and emailed you.""*  I went to the arcadia door and looked out. On the side of the yard I see his abandoned equipment; the wand is bent. The lawn looked empty in the sun, just dried up sod and a big trampled spot in the middle. I unlocked the sliding door to walk out and she said, *""I'm not goin' out there with you. I had enough yesterday.""*  After her story I was a bit nervous as I walked across the yard, but since I didn't have a bucket of pesticide to wage war with, I figured I was probably safe. The lawn was definitely different than when I saw it last, the long rows of sod were buckled up with big fissures running the whole length. Some of them did look a bit deep. I walked back, wiped my shoes on the mat and stepped into the house. I told Karen how sorry I was that she had to go through that, and that I was going to call the exterminator and make sure they were on a schedule from now on and we'd make sure to get everything taken care of. She said she appreciated it, thanked me for the basket and I left.   When I called the exterminating company and gave them my address, the guy on the phone started laughing and said *""Yeah, dude, you wanna talk to Mike. I'm sure he'll be happy to talk to you.""* He gave me his cell number, and I hung up and dialed it.  *""This is Mike.""*  *""Uh, hi. I'm the owner of the house you sprayed yesterday over in Avondale. I guess it had a roach problem?""*  *""Oh yeah, man. It has a roach problem. More like a fuckin' Roach Apocalypse. I ain't never seen nothing' like it. That shit was‚Ä¶ you ever seen that movie 'The Mummy' with that guy Brendan Fraser? It was like that part when the scarabs were zoomin' through the cave at that one guy, just a rolling carpet of them. They were everywhere, man - when I sprayed inside that crack in the sod they came up pissed, like a fire hose straight at my head. I fought 'em as long as I could but there was too many of them. How long you let it get like that?""*  *""It's only been sitting vacant for about a month. I just bought it a few months ago and had it professionally cleaned. Termite inspector didn't say anything about roaches. I never even saw one.""*  *""How long has that sod been there?""*  *""Couple of months. The first tenants put it in on a barter deal.""*  *""Well that's your problem right there. I asked my boss about it and he said he'd only seen it once before, and he's been in the business for thirty years. He said the assholes that put your yard in didn't know what they were doing and didn't tamp it down good enough. I guess there was a space in between the sod and the ground, and you'd been watering it for a while, but then the water probably stopped. A couple of American Reds flew in and you had yourself a goddamn Adam and Eve in the fuckin' Garden of Eden. With all that dark space and wet sod just bakin' in the sun, they start loving' it up reeeaal goood and before you know it, two turned into two friggin' million. Probably only took a couple of weeks, really. They work fast. You got a big problem.""*  *""Wow. I thought the tenant was pulling my leg with that story, but I guess it's true. I'm really sorry, man. I'll call the shop and get you guys back out there to finish the job. How many more times do you think it'll take before they're all gone?""*  *""Beats me, man. You can call Bill but I'm not going out there again. I was in Desert Storm and saw shit I don't like to talk about, but you couldn't pay me enough to go back to that house. I didn't sleep last night.""*  Spoke to Bill. He suggested we dust off and nuke it from space.",‚Ñ¢

Freedman, PhD,corresponding author Uta Landy, PhD, and Jody Steinauer, MD, MAS http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2636458/   &gt;Nontreatment, Delays, and Transport of Patients  &gt;Obstetrician‚Äìgynecologists working in Catholic-owned hospitals described cases in which abortion was medically indicated according to their medical judgment but, because of the ethics committee's ruling, it was delayed until either fetal heartbeats ceased or the patient could be transported to another facility. Dr P, from a midwestern, mid-sized city, said that at her Catholic-owned hospital, approval for termination of pregnancy was rare if a fetal heartbeat was present (even in ‚Äúpeople who are bleeding, they're all the way dilated, and they're only 17 weeks‚Äù) unless ‚Äúit looks like she's going to die if we don't do it.‚Äù In another case, Dr H, from the same Catholic-owned hospital in the Midwest, sent her patient by ambulance 90 miles to the nearest institution where the patient could have an abortion because the ethics committee refused to approve her case.  &gt;&gt;    She was very early, 14 weeks. She came in ‚Ä¶ and there was a hand sticking out of the cervix. Clearly the membranes had ruptured and she was trying to deliver‚Ä¶ . There was a heart rate, and [we called] the ethics committee, and they [said], ‚ÄúNope, can't do anything.‚Äù So we had to send her to [the university hospital]‚Ä¶ . You know, these things don't happen that often, but from what I understand it, it's pretty clear. Even if mom is very sick, you know, potentially life threatening, can't do anything.  &gt;In residency, Dr P and Dr H had been taught to perform uterine evacuation or labor induction on patients during inevitable miscarriage whether fetal heart tones were present or not. In their new Catholic-owned hospital environment, such treatment was considered a prohibited abortion by the governing ethics committee because the fetus is still alive and the patient is not yet experiencing ‚Äúa life-threatening pathology‚Äù such as sepsis. Physicians such as Dr H found that in some cases, transporting the patient to another hospital for dilation and curettage (D&amp;C) was quicker and safer than waiting for the fetal heartbeat to stop while trying to stave off infection and excessive blood loss. Dr B, an obstetrician‚Äìgynecologist working in an academic medical center, described how a Catholic-owned hospital in her western urban area asked her to accept a patient who was already septic. When she received the request, she recommended that the physician from the Catholic-owned hospital perform a uterine aspiration there and not further risk the health of the woman by delaying her care with the transport.  &gt;&gt;    Because the fetus was still alive, they wouldn't intervene. And she was hemorrhaging, and they called me and wanted to transport her, and I said, ‚ÄúIt sounds like she's unstable, and it sounds like you need to take care of her there.‚Äù And I was on a recorded line, I reported them as an EMTALA [Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act] violation. And the physician [said], ‚ÄúThis isn't something that we can take care of.‚Äù And I [said], ‚ÄúWell, if I don't accept her, what are you going to do with her?‚Äù [He answered], ‚ÄúWe'll put her on a floor [i.e., admit her to a bed in the hospital instead of keeping her in the emergency room]; we'll transfuse her as much as we can, and we'll just wait till the fetus dies.‚Äù  &gt;Ultimately, Dr B chose to accept the patient to spare her unnecessary suffering and harm, but she saw this case as a form of ‚Äúpatient dumping,‚Äù because the patient was denied treatment and transported while unstable.",¬©

(looks as though the Asus may be the reverse of Apple on this one, with the keys the case color and the surround a darker color instead of vice versa).    - omits the Windows-centric Home/End/Pageup/Pagedown buttons which are usually present on Windows PCs, for a sleeker keyboard design like the Mac's  - Tapered design with thin front and thick rear  - All ports moved to sides  - ports are symmetric, with a nearly mirror-image between left and right  - ""feet"" on the bottom are round hard plastic which taper into the base of the laptop without a lip  - buttonless trackpad with smooth glassy surface; same dimensions as the Air's  - same essential hinge design as the MacBook series  - camera and indicator light in the same position as the Mac  - thin rubber gasket around screen  - latchless magnetic closure  From [Asus's design page](http://zenbook.asus.com/design/):  &gt; the design team was trying to get the same thin and light profile of a super-high quality watch when developing the ZENBOOK‚Ñ¢.  Versus the language on Apple's page:  &gt;Designing MacBook Air came with one goal: Create an incredibly thin and light notebook computer that‚Äôs every bit as powerful and capable as one twice its size.  The choice of wording on the Zenbook page is very telling because it resembles language that would be used in a defensive legal brief in an infringement lawsuit.  As though they expect to be sued, so they're setting it up ahead of time to prepare by backing up their ""alibi.""    When the 2008 Air came out, I noticed that it looked quite a bit similar in profile and design to my [Skagen wrist watch.](http://i2.squidoocdn.com/resize/squidoo_images/250/draft_lens9197261module81381101photo_1264518564Skagen_Ultra_Thin_Watch_6)  There's a lot of design in common between the two items; the ""unibody"" milled construction, the slightly rounded taper, the stunning thinness (which seems even thinner than it actually is on account of the taper, in both cases).    If you look at the Asus design page again, there's really no detail in the *drawings* other than the actual Asus logo to distinguish the design from the Air.    &gt;They were also going for a seamless and smooth look, with an embedded keyboard and an oversized, integrated touchpad that would be roomy despite the overall compact form factor of the machine. Keeping the proportions just right was critical.  Oh I see, so it's just entirely coincidence that the dimensions and proportions came out just like Apple's, because if you decide to design a ""roomy"" integrated trackpad, it's inevitable for it to be exactly the same size and shape (proportions) as Apple's, right?  &gt;Angular harmony was another highlight of the design process. The ZENBOOK‚Ñ¢ had to have a sharp culminating point on one end, and a rounded, smooth curve on the other.  Which isn't anything like the MacBook Air, which in fact was unusual in that it was thin at one edge and thick at the other.  Most notebooks have been designed to be of uniform thickness, and it's actually one of the irritating traits of the Air since it messes up the balance of a backpack.  Why would Asus copy that trait if not to be like the Air?  &gt;They even paid close attention to the underside, which for the first time ever on a notebook gets the same aluminum hairline treatment as the rest of the machine.  I'm really not sure what they mean by that, since the underside looks quite the same as one prior notebook, the Air.   &gt;You would have to be an absolute moron to confuse the two.  Yes.  Most consumers are absolute morons.  That is why consumer confusion is defined so clearly in legal terms, because if it weren't, they'd have to rely on the fact that very few groups of 12 jurors can actually tell the difference between any two similar objects.

The morbid presentation of the piece, which is shaded graduating from dreary left to brighter right, reads in accord with the viewer's presumed first language (United States American Standard Oxford English, with influence from the Digital Age) and ends on a brighter tone at the top left.

t5_2r2jt,trogladora,1329502566,".4. Being OK  One day, you‚Äôre not going to think about this every day. It may be hard to believe that. I know that whenever something really bad happens to me‚Äînot just big traumas, like sexual assault, but also relatively normal but awful things, like losing a job or a relationship‚ÄîI‚Äôm convinced that I won‚Äôt ever get over it. And in some ways, I never do. I‚Äôll never have that job again. I‚Äôll never be loved by that person again. For the rest of my life, my life will be different, because something was lost. And I‚Äôll never go back to being someone who hasn‚Äôt been sexually assaulted. That‚Äôs something else I lost. A big something. My life would be different if that hadn‚Äôt occurred.  These things still hurt, sometimes. All of them do, the little ones and the big ones. They all still sometimes break my heart. But I‚Äôm older now than I used to be. So I know, now, what happens when the heartbreak is over.  The end of heartbreak is not, generally, big. It doesn‚Äôt announce itself. No one comes to your door with a brass band and crowns you King of Over It and plays the Glorious Anthem of Recovery. It‚Äôs just this: one day, you‚Äôll be sad about what happened. You‚Äôll sit there, with the sadness, expecting it to break you; you‚Äôll expect to go right back to the heart of the pain, the messy animal howling part that you were always so sure would never go away. And then you won‚Äôt go back there. And in that moment, you‚Äôll realize something: you haven‚Äôt actually been there for a long time.  ‚ÄúBeing OK‚Äù isn‚Äôt a celebration. ‚ÄúBeing OK‚Äù isn‚Äôt a guarantee that you‚Äôll never feel the pain again. ‚ÄúBeing OK‚Äù is summed up in six words: that happened a long time ago.  This has changed you. It is always going to be something that has changed you, for the rest of your life. It will pop up in ways that surprise you. There will be days when the pain is back. If you have post-traumatic stress, you are not going to have an easy time of this. You are going to have to walk through more than most to get to ‚ÄúOK,‚Äù and you may have to keep walking back to it, over and over. But you are not alone, and help exists, and ‚Äúthe rest of your life‚Äù is hopefully going to be a very long time. One day, all of this will have happened a long time ago. That‚Äôs what I can tell you, about being OK.  And the fact is, you are not ruined. You are not broken. You are not forbidden to be OK. I actually felt guilty about this, when I realized it was happening to me‚ÄîI thought there was some rule that meant I would only ever get to be bravely suffering and sort of all right, and that if I were actually happy, it would mean that I had betrayed myself and my experience. But this is not a 19th-century novel about a fallen woman; this is your actual life. No rule or event can forbid you from being happy. You can get past ‚ÄúOK.‚Äù You can get way past ‚ÄúOK.‚Äù You can actually get to ‚Äúgreat.‚Äù That‚Äôs where a lot of the sexual assault survivors I‚Äôve met have ended up: GREAT. So I‚Äôm not telling you that you have to be happy now. I‚Äôm telling you that it‚Äôs possible, and common. And one day, you might end up there, and not even realize it until you take a second to look around.  No matter where you are, though, you are not drowning, right now. But you are in the water, and it‚Äôs dangerous. So you have to grab the rope that leads you back to the boat. I am not the rope; I am talking to you so that you know the rope exists; I am talking to you so that you have a few ideas of how to make it to ‚ÄúOK‚Äù again. You‚Äôre out there in the water, and I‚Äôm just telling you to look around for something that‚Äôs going to save you.  Because primarily‚Äîhere is the big secret, the part I wish someone had told me‚Äîyou are what‚Äôs going to save you. Doctors can help you, and you‚Äôll be the one who visits them. People can be trustworthy and capable of helping you heal, if you reach out‚Äîyou‚Äôll be the one who reaches. You may need to get past a bad relationship with a chemical, or a bad relationship with yourself‚Äîyou‚Äôll be the one who gets past it, the only one in the world who has that power. And maybe, on some days, you are going to literally save your own life.  I know you can do this. I know it. Because look at what happened to you. Look at what you‚Äôve been through. And then, take a second to notice this part: it happened, and you are still here. Not just here, but reading an article on the internet about how to save yourself! And you‚Äôve made it to the second to last paragraph! And it is a LONG article.  We call one another ‚Äúsurvivors.‚Äù We don‚Äôt often take the time to think about what that means. What it means is ‚Äúthe people who are still here.‚Äù What it means is that you faced down something that no one should ever have to. And that even this terrible thing was not enough to stop you. What it means is that you are incredibly strong, even in the moments when you don‚Äôt know that. What it means is that you are not drowning‚Äîthere is a rope, a lifeline, and it will bring you back to the boat, and back to safety. What it means is that you are the rope. Grab on. ‚ô¶",‚ô¶

I was always really curious about what other people were doing/feeling/thinking. The only real insight I had was into the lives of my own family, friends, and self. (A limited, albeit microcosmic worldview.)  The internet makes understanding people a lot easier. If they reveal themselves (something social networks like facebook and twitter and communities like reddit are encouraging) you can know their thoughts, motivations, political persuasions (/feelings of apathy), what they're interested in, what their friends/family/work relationships are like, even books they've read (/whether they read), etc etc.   This is all *extraordinarily* fascinating as someone who's always loved studying people.  Also.. it's almost as if there's a kind of collective consciousness created on the digital highway. Like if you're tuned into it, you can better sense what the general populace is thinking. This is becoming intensified the more people share. It trips me out a lot, and also makes me excited for the future. Could we, perhaps, have algorithms exposing how the masses are feeling? How healthy we are? Could there be a government of the future which responds with rational nurturing policies for best protecting people?   I have this sort of.. I've been calling it a *technosocialist* sense.. that this is possible. Inspired, rational socialist policies arising from: the power of consciously evolved human beings (who understand the importance of empathy, creativity, science/understanding nature, connection with the inner and outer world, etc) + our immensely powerful inner processors (our brainz) + the digital processing power of computers + internet where people expose themselves/their needs...  I'm talking healthcare, housing, keeping people safe through nourishing minds &amp; bodies, fostering creativity, innovation, intelligence... we focus far too much on military protection, which is important given the current state of the world [though I hope to experience a future (or at least help build the foundation for a future) where we don't even need military], but we have greater things threatening the US than terrorism/other countries. Like lack of intelligence and creativity and nurturing care! We all need some more love, really. Self love, friendship love, romantic love, neighborly love, community love (in digital *and* physical communities), governmental love, worldly love, cosmic love. That's how I see it.  At the risk of being a dweebo, I like talking about this kind stuff.. so anyone feel free to connect with me here, wherever. Y'know. I'm on the [twitter](http://twitter.com/#!/allyssamilan) and stuff.  I was also considering starting a subreddit to talk about these kinds of things... ideas for/examples of how we can experience a better/kinder/more intelligent future... unless this subreddit already exists, in which case do tell me about it... but, IDK! (I wouldn't be able to do it alone!)  Anyway.

t5_2fwo,Jasper1984,1329512828,"The thing^\* that sucks the most for me is shell, easily. I mean, every time i come anywhere close to using it as a programming language somewhat it bites me. I want when regexing happens to be clean and contained.(the editor can be more free)  It also has no way to show something else than (text)input/output. Still not.. Stuff printed to `/dev/stderr` is shown, then why not have a `/dev/image`, embedding an application or something so commands can show an image or some such right on the terminal, right after invocation.  Doing that will also inhibit the creation of mathematica-like programs which basically uselessly add a layer(on multiple levels, multithreading‚Üîjust running more programs, some kind of objects‚Üîfiles) and possibly restrict people to a programming language.   Some of these improvements need some convention set people somewhat agree on. For editors, there is little effect in terms of 'inter-usabilty' for different people, so there is very little merit in discussing that. But for other things, it makes things useless for some people. For instance a gui program not showing its functionality in a programmatic manner.  Also I actually kindah like emacs, largely it is very good.. I guess not having multiple windows *very much* should be solved. And i guess i could try find fancier ways to visualize and select the buffers that i have, just to know. he only point on emacs i dislike is how *terrible* the bookmarks selector was for me until i started using tab-completion much.

t5_2qh2p,HappyGoPink,1329515101,"&gt; ok guys, like you many of you, I find myself to be a very logical thinker. The fact that there is no proof of God is the very basis behind my doubts. so my question to you guys is, what is the most obscure or minimalistic (i know im making up words) proof you require to accept God as truth? An example: prophecies in the bible (revelations) that come to pass, and you are witness to it, or even down to a complete change in a born again christian (their happiness, whether or not they feel complete) (I do believe if God is real, people who are truly Christian, and are new to it will have their lives changed in every single aspect)  The problem with prophecy is the inability to determine if it is a mere coincidence, or if it was deliberatly brought about by someone intending to validate the prophecy, and therefore the belief. Too much room for fraud.  &gt;or do you need more straight forward approach? (your name being commanded by the heavens, i.e)  This could be an auditory hallucination. Inconclusive.  &gt; Finally, If God were to without a doubt provide proof for his existence, would that prevent any of us from having free will? (we would no longer have a choice in what we believe, even if we still reject it, it it was proven to be fact)  I would still reject his ass, if ""God"" turns out to be Christian Bible Yahweh‚Äîa murderously evil motherfucker if there ever was one. I'd ""believe"" in him, or rather simply acknowledge the obvious fact of his existence, but I'd still oppose him. He's *evil.*  &gt; just a thought... perhaps faith in God was the only way he could allow us to have free will. (please do not assume I am christian. I am simply looking for answers like everyone else and would appreciate insight from you guys)  Well, this is directly contradicted by Genesis. Don't forget, Yahweh supposedly created us the way he wanted us to be‚Äîwithout free will, without knowledge of good and evil. He even lied to us, threatening us that if we ate Knowledge Fruit‚Ñ¢, we would die the same day. Well, since they did eat the fruit, and they didn't die, we know Yahweh is a fucking liar. And the fact that he tossed them out on their ass to keep them from eating Immortality Fruit‚Ñ¢ tells us that ""dying the same day"" wasn't a metaphor for ""becoming mortal"". So yeah, Yahweh never intended for us to be anything but mindless pets in a zoo. Talking Snake is the one who told Evie the truth, though it suffered for doing so. Yeah, how dare the snake tell the truth and ruin Yahweh's mindless pets.  ",‚Ñ¢

t5_2qh1i,LincolnshireSausage,1329516255,"I work in the real estate industry, not as a Realtor¬Æ fortunately. It is tough to make money as a Realtor and many Realtors do it as a retirement job or as additional income to another job. They do not have any guaranteed income from selling houses. The only way they earn money is to sell a house. The listing agent and the selling agent split the commission on the house. On a $200000 house the commission might be 6% and this is split two ways. If it is an even split the agent may make $6000. If the Realtor sells 6 houses a year then they will take home $36000 before tax. Add to this the MLS fees, brokerage fees and the cost of continuing real estate education that they are required to take and you can see that they do not make much money. Because their income is directly related to the cost of houses in recent years Realtors have seen their income drop dramatically.   The Realtor you did not buy the house from spent a lot of his time researching houses for you and showing you them. He has not been paid one cent for doing this and now they have lost the sale there is no chance of any income for all of the work they have done. The Realtor now sees this as wasted time. He could have used this time more productively showing houses to other prospects or canvasing for new prospects. Imagine if you went to work for a couple of weeks and then found out you were not going to get paid for it.  I can understand the Realtor's frustration. He basically sold you the house and then you closed the deal with someone else who took his commission for doing next to nothing. It certainly was not very professional of him to say you cheated him and his family. I am sure he did not answer his phone, got back to you late and got J's name wrong because he is working his butt off trying to support his family. Again, it's not very professional of him but these are not fun times for Realtors. He may be having difficulty in making his own mortgage payments because of the recent drop in house prices. There are also less people buying houses due to the economic downturn and due to banks being more strict as to who qualifies for mortgages. Each Realtor/brokerage has a slightly different method of selling you a house within the rules for their MLS. He may not have been the best Realtor and he may have been trying to cut some corners so he can get more work done and have a better chance of supporting his family but what you did was not cool.   The best way to find a good Realtor is to get recommendations from other people who have bought a house recently. If they have had a good experience then chances are you will too. Buying a house is a probably the largest investment you will make and you should not just call someone out of the blue who you know nothing about. There are good and bad Realtors just like there is good and bad in any profession and you need to make damn sure that you pick the right one before you start looking for a house. 80% of Realtors today will not be Realtors in 5 years time; most find it much too difficult to make anywhere near the amount of money they were expecting to make. On the other hand, the good Realtors usually are very good. This guy may not have been the best Realtor but I know he wants to earn money and because of that I am sure he would have sold you the house. It would also not be in his best interest to have not submitted the offer on the first house. He will never make money if he does not submit offers.",¬Æ

t5_2r2jt,DoesNotHappen,1329556842,"I actually wrote a review of Hall Pass for my uni's paper:  First, a confession: I am a media masochist. I derive a perverse enjoyment from horrid movies.  It‚Äôs a taste I developed at sleepovers in early high school, a defensive response to being forced by eager friends to watch the latest teen-marketed, syrupy, oddly sinister romantic comedies. Together we would sit down, popcorned and blanketed in front of the host family‚Äôs television, and we would watch as the good girls got superfluous makeovers, the boys got the girls, no one ever communicated openly or saw anything wrong with stalking, and everyone lived insufferably ever after. I was transfixed by the carnage on screen, and occasionally driven to muttering under my breath, making Mystery Science Theatre-style quips about whatever atrocity was playing out in front of us.   At some stage, I discovered that other kids in the group were equally frustrated by these films, and equally prone to snarkily muttering about them. Watching bad romances and rom coms became a joy, a chance to bond with others who were both repulsed and fascinated by the genre and its peculiar tendency to celebrate the worst of humanity. Over the years, I‚Äôve seen and verbally ripped apart the most prominent offenders (Twilight: New Moon, in which an old friend and I were shushed by a gaggle of swooning youths because we were giggling too loudly during the lovers‚Äô reconciliation scene, Sex and the City 2: Privilege Boogaloo, only survived by sitting next to a Gender Studies major, and He‚Äôs Just Not That Into You, which had me cowering under a pillow at a girls‚Äô night last year). I‚Äôve inadvertently discovered a few cinematic gems, marketed to look much shinier and shallower than they were (Uptown Girls, surprisingly clever and beautifully acted), and learned that movies starring Katherine Heigl need no longer be given even the benefit of the doubt.  Essentially, when I was presented with an opportunity to review Hall Pass, the latest offering from the directors who brought us Dumb and Dumber, Shallow Hal, Something About Mary and Stuck on You, I thought I was entirely prepared. Surely, I reasoned, it can‚Äôt be that bad. I‚Äôve survived The Ugly Truth. I can take this easily. Reader, I was wrong.   Hall Pass is the tale of two middle-aged married men, Rick (Owen Wilson) and Fred (Jason Sudeikis), who are tormented by the knowledge that they are doomed to monogamy for the rest of their lives. (Doomed, I say! Cower before their miserable fates!) Though they do love their still-gorgeous wives, Maggie and Grace (Jenna Fischer and Christina Applegate), they crave their lost youth and the freedom to have sex with any of the multitudes of nubile women who populate their local parks, coffee shops and daydreams. At poker nights they joke about how much they would pay to have an anonymous fling without being discovered, and their wives overhear them making crassly lascivious wisecracks about their female acquaintances at a housewarming. Maggie and Grace, frustrated by their husbands‚Äô constant rubbernecking and obsessing over other women, complain to their award-winning psychologist friend, Dr. Lucy (Joy Behar, best known for her role as co-host on The View). Dr. Lucy advises the ladies to give the guys a week off marriage, hence the eponymous ‚Äúhall pass‚Äù ‚Äì a week in which they have permission to do whatever they like, regardless of how their wives might feel about it. Maggie and Grace head off with their children to stay elsewhere for a week, where they stumble upon temptations of their own; Rick and Fred head to a hotel and rent a room (yes, one room with two single beds, a logistical oversight never noticed by anyone in the film), and Wacky Hijinks Ensue.   Though the film does manage to squeeze in two poop jokes, a full complement of ‚Äúlol, rape‚Äù jokes, stoner humour, the inevitable ‚Äúyou fucked my mother‚Äù scenario, and a sight gag about ethnicity correlating with penis size, the lowest common denominator tone of the humour isn‚Äôt actually what makes it unbearable to watch. The larger problem with the film is that it manages to paint an incredibly grim picture of men, women and long term relationships and expects its audience to identify fondly with its characters. When Maggie declares that men are like housecats (they need proper training, and wouldn‚Äôt survive long in the harsh outside world without their masters), and Grace rejoins that they‚Äôre more like dogs, the audience is meant to be nodding and smiling; when Grace declares that, as a good woman and wife, anything she does with her husband between the hours of 10pm and 6am ought to be faked, the audience is meant to be howling with mirth, identifying with her plight and her philosophies. In the world of Hall Pass, all long-term relationships are eventually fated to descend into resentment and contempt, and all men are childish, boorish and self-delusional. And, judging by the crowd in the session I saw, it‚Äôs a date movie.  It certainly doesn‚Äôt help that the husbands don‚Äôt seem to have anything in common with their wives, because all their wives‚Äô interests are stereotypically feminine, and, well, everyone knows guys aren‚Äôt into that. (At one stage, Fred asks Maggie to keep his poker winnings secret from Grace, fearing that she‚Äôll force him to spend the money on shoes, tickets to see Kathy Griffin, or, we can only presume, chocolate and tampons and giant plush toy uteruses.) The underlying problem becomes clear when Fred, trying to convince Rick that he ought to take advantage of his fleeting freedom, states that their wives have consistently been given the chance to achieve all their dreams through marriage, whilst their own dreams have been neglected for years. As young girls, Fred tells Rick, their wives ‚Äúprobably‚Äù played with doll‚Äôs houses, Easybake‚Ñ¢ ovens and baby dolls, and now their devoted husbands have ‚Äúgiven‚Äù them homes, children and kitchens. Meanwhile, when‚Äôs the last time Rick got to, say, host Wheel of Fortune? (My rather long-suffering boyfriend chose to endure the film with me, and at this point his jaw was hanging open, his head cradled in his hands.)   The ‚Äúprobably‚Äù is the key ‚Äì though we know the couples have been married for years, there‚Äôs no indication that they really know or understand one another at all, that they‚Äôre capable of discussing their daily frustrations or resolving any of their larger issues. In the absence of this genuine connection, the husbands avoid conflict and fantasise about escaping from their marriages, while the wives treat their husbands like naughty, wayward children, all the while feeling isolated and unwanted. Spoiler ahead: at the end of the film, Rick reveals to Maggie that he lost his virginity to her when they met in college ‚Äì something they had evidently never discussed in their twenty years of marriage. And though Maggie is touched by the revelation, the fact that the couple evidently have never entirely opened up to one another isn‚Äôt even considered an issue as far as the film narrative is concerned. Though the movie is ostensibly about sexual frustration, that‚Äôs the least of the couples‚Äô problems, and once you become aware that nothing else is going to be resolved ‚Äì evidently because the scriptwriters see this lack of connection as par for the course rather than especially problematic ‚Äì the film becomes nearly intolerable to watch. Sure, the husbands and wives come away from the experiment with a renewed faith in monogamy, but they still don‚Äôt know or like each other that much.  The supporting characters aren‚Äôt doing the film many favours either. Nicky Whelan is relatively charming as the object of Rick‚Äôs extramarital affections, an Australian barista. But the price we pay for her inclusion is the presence of her creepily obsessed colleague, played by Derek Waters with an intense animosity that goes beyond credibility and into the realm of either caricature or Jack Nicholson from The Shining. Rick and Frank‚Äôs friend Coakley (Richard Jenkins), elderly swinging bachelor, arguably has a certain Hefneresque larrikin charm, but gives advice about as good as the Bad Idea Bears in Avenue Q (‚ÄúTake her home, she‚Äôs ~~wasted~~ in withdrawal from cigarette addiction!‚Äù) The only true standouts are the disturbingly perfect, tanned, primped and Stepforded family who host the housewarming ‚Äì castlewarming, actually ‚Äì which sparks the beginning of the marital drama. Owen Wilson, to be fair, does his valiant best to make his character likeable, and it‚Äôs a shame to see him floundering in a movie this awful. Jenna Fischer puts in an equally solid effort, but they‚Äôre fighting the script and losing.  Probably, someday, someone (based on past precedent, probably someone French) will make an intelligent, genuinely funny, well thought out film about a couple‚Äôs transition away from monogamy and the positive effect it has on their marriage. It‚Äôs not this movie. After the film ended, my boyfriend and I wandered, shellshocked, through Chadstone, eventually emerging into a warm, muggy Melbourne night, whereupon he was shat on by a bird. He reports that the bird incident was both funnier and more enjoyable than Hall Pass.  ",‚Ñ¢

In the dream, S.W. envisioned that he was abandoned in a lifeboat off the isle Cozumel in the Gulf of Mexico. Having been stranded for days with no food nor sweetwater, his days of barren existence finally were broken my an anthropomorphized alligator who spoke to him from the water of Ancient Egyptian Steles unrecovered. A devout Lutheran Anarchochristian at the time‚Äîa learning brought to him by Dadaist Tristan Tzara during the early 1940's‚ÄîS.W.'s dream-self threatened the alligator with a flaregun in the lifeboat. The alligator plunged deep into the oceanic abyss, and just as S.W. turned away, it resurfaced with a sawed-off shotgun in retaliation.  In lieu of the Deep Horizon Oil Superexplosion, the artist enchanted his fevered dreamscape with a shitty, gasoline rainbow, which the alligator has here been depicting as taking refuge behind the homosexual pride-slick.

(which came into full use in 2004, after designs for it started in [1999](http://asclub.uwaterloo.ca/20110228_Issue03_Final.pdf))  WaterlooWorks was formally cancelled on February 22nd, 2011, by the Provost at the time. At that point, it had been through two rounds of beta testing with the School of Architecture students, failing miserably both times since it didn't scale well to multiple users. Since then, the university has recognized that it has to support JobMine for longer than anticipated. (They were counting on WaterlooWorks to succeed and hadn't been trying to improve JobMine) This led to some UI changes being pushed through last August (relatively minor, but still nice none-the-less) and the 'endorsement' of student written 'addons' like [JobMine Plus](http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/80771).  The official word from the university is that they are looking into software packages they can purchase from various companies, (In a similar way to Quest and LEARN) and modify to suit the 'surprisingly complex' rules of the UW registrar.  If you're interested, you can read a blog post from a student who was involved in the WaterlooWorks project about his opinions on [why the project failed](http://whoyoucallingajesse.com/past/2011/02/27/what-happened-to-the-new-co-op-system-at-uwaterloo/).  Also, you check out the [previous thread on this topic](http://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/pg9mc/on_the_possibility_of_opensourcing_jobmine/) (it sounds like you already have)  Overall, there is no new development happening by the university, although I think that the students would like to see some transparency surrounding why the previous projects failed. (Source code, documentation, reports, etc.) Especially since the project cost [$2.7 million dollars](http://iwarrior.uwaterloo.ca/pdf/w11i4.pdf) (Page 11) ",¬©

His rookie half-year of 2005 is probably the reason teams keep fooling themselves that he can play.  I also disagree about the pressure.  I don't think it's pressure, I think he just sucks.  He had a fluke decent year in Kansas City, but he sucked everywhere else.  What pressure is there in Atlanta with half a stadium every night, including the playoffs, and people are more interested in NASCAR?  And he didn't really feel any pressure with the Mets either since (a) there were a zillion other things wrong with the team and no one pinpointed him as one of them, and (b) he somehow got the Yankee Criticism-Free Media Pass‚Ñ¢ that only a rare few Mets get (and some Yankees miss out on occasionally).  ",‚Ñ¢
t5_2qm7u,dances_w_vowels,1329673274,"&gt;Yankee Criticism-Free Media Pass‚Ñ¢  Yes. He sucked. That's why. :)  As for ""fantastic guy"" while he was on the team he took blame for his failings and didn't throw a teammate under the bus. He signed autographs and posed for cameras. He took interviews and was always engaging. If he's on your team, this is positive behavior.  Do you consider Beltran an ass for what he's said the last couple months? Or only because of his strikeout looking in 2006?  *edit: formatting",‚Ñ¢

t5_2cneq,physicscat,1329688773,"First - minimum wage jobs, at hourly pay, are not meant to be ""careers.""           Stocking shelves and running a cash register are not careers,          they're jobs.  Second - salaried employees get benefits, because they have made              working at Wal-Mart a career in management.   Third - Times change. I used to love this little bookstore by my house called the Colony bookstore. After a while they couldn't keep up when larger bookstores came to Savannah. Not too long ago my favorite store Border's closed up here in Atlanta where I live now. Why? Their business model of choosing NOT to embrace internet sales and e-readers killed them.  Times change. There are grumblings that Congress should bail out newspapers that are dying. Why? Selling papers is obsolete in this day and age. Companies come and go. New innovators come in and are eventually replaced if they don't keep up with the times. Is it sad sometimes? Yes. But this is how the free-market works, and the great thing is, if your business fails, you can start another one, and another one. You can file for bankruptcy, restructure and start over.  I rarely visit Wal-Mart, it is not my favorite store, but as our society changes so must businesses and they if they can't compete so be it.   Oh, and they don't HAVE to seek public assistance. I know many people who CHOOSE to have video game consoles, UVerse and the like, top of the line cell phones, tricked out cars and smoke and drink, a lot. For the money they spend on cigarettes alone, they could afford to buy health insurance. I did when I was working an hourly job. I did not have a smart phone, I chose my internet connection over TV, I chose not to purchase a video game console or any other expensive item until....wait for it....I could afford to AFTER making sure I had the necessities, like health insurance.  So as for the health insurance thing....if you live in America, are given a free education, food stamps, housing, and more and more and more, and you STILL can't do better than an hourly wage job, you're making bad decisions and living with the consequences. Those of us who made good decisions, unfortunately are still having to support you.   Stop blaming Wal-Mart. If all you aspire to is running a cash register, you made a decision, now live with it.

t5_2reni,bkayh685,1329746677,"Soon-to-be Pharmacist here.  The short answer to your question is: it depends.  Most OTC meds (acetaminophen, naproxen, ibuprofen, lopermide, etc) *that are packaged in bulk bottles* are quite stable within their expiration dates, granted that they stay within the temperature on the bottle (usually between (roughly) 59 - 78 degrees Fahrenheit) and aren't exposed to extreme humidity.    Where you need to be careful is dealing with meds in blister packs.  Loperamide (Imodium¬Æ) generally comes in blister packs and that's because it oxidizes fairly quickly when exposed to air.    For those of you who know a thing or two about chemistry, here's a quick trick.  Chemical structures containing non-carboxylic acid hydroxyl groups (-OH) are very susceptible to oxidation.  These drugs have relatively short shelf-lives which get even shorter when their packaging is opened (hence, the reason they're usually blister-packed).  Check out the structure of the drug on wikipedia.  If the structure doesn't contain many -OH groups (like [ibuprofen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibuprofen)), you're probably safe carrying it around in a bag.  Of course, there are exceptions to this rule, but it's a good reference.   EDIT: Also, try to keep them in a light-resistant container (Altoids tin, amber prescription bottle, etc.)",¬Æ

t5_2qh16,electronics-engineer,1329757816,"TL?FO  Chrome connects to three random domains at startup.  When you start Chrome, it attempts to connect to three random domains like http://aghepodlln/ or http://lkhjasdnpr/. I‚Äôve seen a few theories about why exactly this happens that brush up against the nefarious. The true rationale is incredibly mundane: hopefully this short summary will clear things up.  The goal of the requests is to determine if you‚Äôre currently on a network that intercepts and redirects requests for nonexistent hostnames. For example, it‚Äôs not at all uncommon for ISP to transparently redirect failed DNS lookups in order to convert requests like http://text/ into requests for http://your.helpful.isp/search?q=text. Leaving aside a discussion of the rightness or wrongness of these ‚Äúhelpful‚Äù activities, this behavior causes problems for Chrome. Specifically, it breaks some heuristics the Omnibox uses to determine whether a user means to search for a specific term, or to visit a non-standard domain name.  Google‚Äôs internal network is a good example of how this can cause problems. Internally, a short-link service named ‚Äúgo‚Äù makes sharing memorable links straightforward. If I type ‚Äúgo‚Äù in Chrome‚Äôs Omnibox and hit enter, it‚Äôs not exactly clear whether I mean to visit http://go/ or to search for ‚ÄúGo‚Äù (which is an interesting programming language, by the way). Chrome does its best to do The Right Thing‚Ñ¢ in response to this sort of user input by executing a search, and then, in the background, executing a HEAD request for the potential domain. If the server responds, Chrome will display an infobar, asking if you meant to navigate to http://go/, and it will remember your response for future reference.  As you can see, this feature is completely broken if your ISP intercepts all such requests: you‚Äôd get infobars on every one-word search. So Chrome checks things out at startup, and whenever your IP address changes. And, Chrome is beautifully open-source, so let‚Äôs take a quick look at the very straightforward implementation:  IntranetRedirectDetector is the place to start. When Chrome starts up, it creates an IntranetRedirectorDetector object. This sets up a short delay (currently hard-coded to 7 seconds) in order to ensure that it doesn‚Äôt get in the way of time-critical startup activities, and then calls IntranetRedirectDetector::FinishSleep() where the real work begins. This method generates three random domain names, and kicks off asynchronous HEAD requests to each in such a way that they don‚Äôt generate cache entries, and don‚Äôt save cookies. As each of these requests completes, IntranetRedirectDetector::OnURLFetchComplete() is called to record the result. If any two of the three requests resolve to the same host, that host is stored as the network‚Äôs ‚Äúredirect origin‚Äù. Easy.  This information is used in AlternateNavURLFetcher to determine whether or not an infobar should be shown for a specific Omnibox-generated search. If the HEAD request returns the same site as the redirect origin Chrome saw at startup, then it‚Äôs ignored. If it‚Äôs a different origin, then a helpful infobar might be in order.  So there you have it. Chrome makes three requests to random domains just after startup in order to provide its Omnibox heuristics with enough information to correctly work out a user‚Äôs intent. These requests are not sending your valuable data anywhere for nefarious purposes, nor are they useful for tracking purposes. The requests happen in order to fix crbug.com/18942, and for no other reason.",‚Ñ¢

t5_2t7j9,OtherAccountIsYacht,1329759492,"Wow man, that is a strange kind of logic you've formed for yourself there. I like the way your trying to paint me as someone who is harming the server when all I was doing was playing by the rules - that is like me killing KTmouse in a first person shooter, then him rage-quitting said shooter and you coming along and saying that I'm ruining the community of the fps. I play by the server rules, nothing more and nothing less, if you have a problem with that, then you are the one who is hurting the server and it's community, not I. Anything else is just pure and utter slander.  Since I've come to find this wonderful server, I have abided steadfastly to the rules and regulations put forward by Stuck@work - the same rules and regulations that originally attracted me to the server. Furthermore I have leased a dedicated mumble server to nurture communication, have put forward an alpha banner for the subreddit (a more advanced vector based one is in the works) and donated once without asking for any benefits in return (the shiny name is nice though). I you build What have you done for the community lately bar ensuring you that you guys joint venture was moved through to the next map reset - taking into account the rules of the server and that a lot of us have already partaken in joint building efforts too - wup dee doo, you excavated a dungeon and then over-hyped it on the front page of the subreddit, have a cookie). Anyone who knows has seen me online knows that I have always helped beginners out in order to sustain players (I am not required to do this, that's a moral call, every player can choose for himself if he wants to slay newbies or not), but if you build a huge fuck-off base then I think I can say that raiding it is fair game to me within the server rules.  After the attack I have been accused of x-raying without a shred of proof (thankfully this bogus claim was quickly dispelled thanks to samri), I been accused of saying that mine_crafters took part in the raid, when I didn't in anyway (we only said the truth, that he found it found it funny when he heard/saw what we did) and now I'm being accused of ruining the server too, jeez.  You said to me that you were disappointed in me because we seemed to get on well before this raid. Well I must say that the feeling is mutual, but for differen't reasons. The way you handled yourself verbally after the raid was completely unsavoury and the aftermath of something like this shows what kind of ugly personality traits come crawling out of the woodwork. I'm also talking about Kt here.  You really need to learn to separate what goes on in a videogame (see my earlier fps example) from our real life persona. I play videogames to do things I would never do in real life within the frame of the rules of the game/server. Once you learn to separate these entities I sure you'll find me a *pretty cool guy‚Ñ¢* and I'm sure I could find a similar sentiment for you, but first you guys need to stop attacking me on such a base; infantile level.  I also want to say that Cedric has been the purest of gentleman in response to this whole affair. He didn't spout untrue shit on reddit, he took out his culling blade and smote me down well proper.

t5_2ryfy,mainliner53,1329784651,"&gt;Because it's wrong to believe in things without any evidence.  I take it that your answer is that it is wrong because it is wrong. Kind of a circular logic, but if it works for you‚Ä¶     &gt;What do you mean by this, and how would you prove it?   God is personal and one with whom a human being can enter into a relationship as a creature with the Creator. We call that relationship faith. I can‚Äôt prove it. I don‚Äôt need to. I have a relationship with my parents, but I cannot prove it. You can, however, witness the effects in my life. Once again, I must remind you that I have stated several times that God‚Äôs existence is not in the realm of the testable, measurable or quantifiable. One can however, talk to God. God can communicate with human beings and has. A person can love God and live in a way that he or she believes would be pleasing to God. If a person doesn‚Äôt have that relationship he or she cannot somehow measure or test another person‚Äôs relationship. You may deny it, or mock it, or wonder about it. But that really doesn‚Äôt matter.    &gt;It's a outline description of the process. Evidence would be linking you to fossils etc.   I realize that it is an outline. I also know that the fossil record fits in there. The only segment I was interested in is the proof (or evidence) that inert matter transformed itself into purposeful, self-reflective, intelligent minds. That final step (or steps). Somehow fossils just doesn‚Äôt do the trick.    &gt;I wish you'd stop jumping straight to concluding that there's little evidence before you've even given me a change to explain.   I did not jump to any conclusions. I asked the question only.   &gt;Could you please answer my question on which you believe (agree with) and which you don't?   I accept and understand each stage in the outline you offered as a plausible description of what is thought to have taken place in the evolutionary process of physical matter. I don‚Äôt disagree with any of the purported stages. These stages, however, have yet to be proved. Much of the evidence is lacking and the overall process is simply plausible guesses. I find no reason to not believe that the physical universe unfolded in those or similar stages. Such belief is not a matter of certain knowledge. I do not find the stages objectionable. So I am eager for you to alert me to the way inert matter transformed into thinking matter.   &gt;It's nothing to do with ""belief"", it's just definitions.   It sounds as though you really like to avoid the words believe or belief. I find those to be useful words. I offered a definition of the word purpose on several occasions. Maybe you missed it. I also contrasted it with tastiness. Purpose, while immeasurable and unquantifiable (like other abstract nouns such as honor, dignity, love, hope) can be defined. We know what we mean when we speak of purpose. What I think you mean is that tastiness and purpose both derive from personal preferences. I figured that you think that (I avoided the word believe although it would be equally useful in normal conversational English to employ it).   If purpose and tastiness are only matters of personal preference, so be it. Hitler had a purpose to elevate the Aryan race to world dominance in the name of the Third Reich for the glory of the German peoples. He found Jews distasteful (not related to the taste buds in this case). His program proceeded accordingly. Both were his personal preferences.  Some  people opposed him because they preferred a different world.      &gt;I simply gave you my understand of the word. You want to define the word ""purpose"" differently, do so. Give me an example experiment which would determine what the purpose of something is.   Now Joeflux, c‚Äômon ‚ò∫I have previously stated that there is no such experiment to determine the purpose of a thing. I guess I must repeat myself, but as a teacher I have learned that repetition is a valued teaching tool ‚ò∫. Some simple things we know have a purpose, like a hammer. One can demonstrate its use, but there is not experiment that determines that. Human beings make tools for human purposes. If we chance upon a gizmo and don‚Äôt know what it is or what it is used for, our best bet is to consult the person who made it (as in your example of an author of a book). Or we may identify something comparable of which we already know the purpose and surmise that this artifact may have a similar purpose. Some artifacts discovered in archeological digs still puzzle us as to their purpose. Experiments aren‚Äôt really appropriate or helpful to discover purpose.      &gt;In my definition, an example would be that you could ask a writer what the purpose of his book is, and he might tell you that it's to make money. But the book reader might say that the purpose of the book is gain enjoyment. Thus, from this definition, we can easily see that the purpose of an object is subjective. If you meant something else by purpose, simply give me a definition and an experiment to determine what the purpose of something is.   I never implied that I meant anything else by the word purpose.   &gt;Then it's completely meaningless to ask whether human life has purpose since you've left the word undefined.    I did not leave the word undefined. I defined it. I will cut and past my last sentences from my previous post above. Here is what I offered as a definition of purpose: ‚ÄúI use the word purpose to mean rationale, intention, goal, raison d‚Äôetre, whatever.‚Äù Other definitions of the word purpose are available also in English language dictionaries). One is ‚Äúreason for existence.‚Äù Another is ‚Äúdesired effect.‚Äù As a verb it means to ‚Äúset something as a goal‚Äù.   &gt;You might as well have as whether people have flurgles and then refused to define what flurgle means.  That is really  humorous but is a silly example. I used the word purpose and defined it as well.   &gt;You can start by sharing your own purpose for living. Under your unmeasurable and unquantified definition? It's a meaningless question. How would I determine something that is undeterminable? :-)   That is a clever parry but it appears to me that you are evading the question. Do you mean that you have never reflected on the purpose in your own life? It is not a meaningless question at all. Purpose is not indeterminable. I never stated that purpose is indeterminable. I opined that experiments are not correct method to yield a purpose. Although I will admit that in limited ways experiments may help us understand purpose, as, for example, when a series of medical experiments assist us to determine the purpose of some gland, the excretion of which we did not know its benefit.   It seems that you have contradicted yourself. Above, you gave a good example asking an author the purpose of a book that he or she wrote. It was not a nonsense question at all. While it is not measurable or quantifiable, it is not indeterminable. The author, in your example, stated a purpose that is plausible. Of course, it could be that the author stated a purpose that was not the real purpose either by way of deception, or because he or she wrongly perceived their own purpose. Often our own human hearts can deceive us. Humans are often a bundle of conflicting and contradictory passions that subvert our own motives and hide our intentions.   Some people report that their purpose is to serve humanity, but the real purpose may be to get money, be well thought of, or to bask in popularity and public approval. But those are side issues.    One of the crises in public education is clarify the purpose of the whole educational enterprise. Purpose, (in dealing with these meta-ethical issues) relates to the field of philosophy we might call teleology. The state is often conflicted over the appropriate purpose and goal into which it chooses to educate a young person. In totalitarian states the purpose of education is often to shape compliant citizens.          When we state a purpose it usually means that we have thought about the end goals and established a reason for pursuing them. Some atheists have a definite purpose, or goal, to convert theists to atheism. Purpose is not a nonsense question at all. I am surprised that you would dismiss it as such. Perhaps I have misunderstood you.  My question is,  ‚Äúdo you think there is a purpose for human existence?‚Äù If that sounds too lofty, then try this question,  ‚ÄúDo you have a purpose (a goal a passion) in your life?      ",‚ò∫

Modern plastic-lined cables have made the use of grease inappropriate, because the viscosity of the grease makes for sluggish cable movement. This is a more critical concern with modern brake and gear systems that use weaker return springs, and with indexed shifting in general.  &gt;Many manufacturers now recommend against using any lubrication on cables. It certainly should be avoided in the case of sealed systems such as Gore-Tex ¬Æ. Bicycles used in wet conditions, however, will often benefit by the application of a bit of oil, more as a rust-preventive than as a lubricant. The area of particular concern is the short loop of housing which carries the rear derailer cable around from the chainstay to the derailer.  &gt;Some bicycles provide awkward cable routing which forces housing to enter cable stops/adjusting barrels at a fairly sharp angle. This is particularly common on rear cantilever brakes. It often helps to put a bit of grease on the bit of cable that runs through such fittings.

My best guess is that the battery drained (likely, since I didn't plug the computer in to recharge before I went to sleep, which I usually do) and that something is wrong with the cord that plugs into the outlet.  * I doubt that there is some problem with the battery since it should work just fine without the AC adapter.  &gt;Thanks, but ""taking the memory out"" sounds way over my head in terms of complexity. I wouldn't even know where to find the memory.  * Most of the time taking out me memory isn't really hard. Just unscrew one panel on the bottom and you can see it, then just slight pressure on both sides of the memory and you can take it out. *  Check out this site: [link](http://www.insidemylaptop.com/category/1-acer-laptops/) and go through the various models they have disassembled, I'm not sure which type your laptop is, on the bottom of the page you can go to the 'Previous Entries' they have also done.   * Here is a picture of a backside of an Acer Aspire laptop [link](http://www.insidemylaptop.com/images/Acer-Aspire-One/take-apart-netbook-14.jpg)   Not sure if you still have warranty or not, if you have you should contact your supplier, about the issue.  Personally I think this issue has something to do with your bios sadly, which is hard(almost impossible, in most cases) to repair with out replacing the motherboard it self.  To conclude that it is indeed some issue with the motherboard you need to do some things:  * Try to boot without battery on AC adapter only. ‚úî * Remove memory and place back.   After that you can pretty much conclude that it is indeed the motherboard or something with the power but you stated something about the lights:  &gt;All that happens is the light on the front that usually indicates the battery is charging goes on and stays on if I hit the power button, but otherwise there's absolutely nothing happening.

t5_2qh1i,MichaelCarter,1329852087,"Per your arguments:   1)	I agree that paying statutory royalties for samples stifles creativity.  If one purpose of copyright is to provide exclusive rights to the copyright holder to sell his/her work (or if the copyright has been transferred, someone else‚Äôs work) so as to encourage future creativity, I don‚Äôt think this applies to sampling.  Sampling to me is like using Heinz Ketchup to make a proprietary Asian BBQ sauce.  Of course, if you are sampling Heinz Ketchup to make Kentucky‚Äôs Finest Ketchup, there may be a problem.    2)	 Legislating royalty rates is an attempt to correct a perceived market failure, i.e. the idea that if you create a work, you will be able to monitor and demand contractual royalty arrangements with all of the commercial users of that work.  In theory, I agree with you.  It would be great to have the market regulate this.  Some artists may be fine with a much smaller royalty rate and their music would be consumed/used on a broader scale.  Other artists would require very high royalty rates and their music would not be consumed/used on as high a scale.  But in practice, I think this would result in large scale market failure and a higher end-cost to the consumer/user in the form of higher overhead to negotiate / enforce varying licensing arrangements (see the Movie Industry).    3)	I think the point you raise in your third argument bolsters my response to your second argument.  It is not copyright‚Äôs fault that so many musicians and screenwriters sell away their work in return for license fees, option fees, royalties, and the like.  That is the very market at play that you claim should handle royalty rates.  No one forces an up and coming screenwriter to, when optioning a screenplay, agree to also sell the copyright in the work and all derivative works to the big time studio that is in turn paying them $30,000 upfront plus an additional $30,000 upon use of the work.  That is a market arrangement.  And if you don‚Äôt want to agree to that, then perhaps you should find a movie producer/distributor that will allow you to keep your copyright and risk putting several millions of dollars into production/distribution.  (they do not exist)  In addition, almost all professional screenwriters belong to the screenwriters‚Äô guild, which further protects the creators by imposing preset royalty rates, licensing fees, option fees, etc.  If anything, it could be argued that without copyright protection, the big studios could just prowl the ether for great screenplays and produce them without paying anything to the content creator.  Although I can‚Äôt imagine why anyone would spend two years of their life toiling over a 130-page story written for the big screen without knowing that there was gonna be some way of being rewarded for the fruits of their labor.  Copyright law, and derivative agreements (i.e. guild arrangements), allow for content creators to be awarded for their work.  Whether a given content creator chooses a licensing arrangement or selling arrangement is up to that person.  It could further be argued that with the advent of the series of tubes, distribution channels for independent content creators are broader and more easily accessible than ever before, and are only increasing.  But unchecked use of these channels would again, defeat the motivations for someone to create a lot of the best content out there today.  (See The Dark Knight, L O S T, Soul Caliber, Billy Joel, The Hunger Games, etc.)    4)	I agree with almost everything you said starting with ‚ÄúEvery work is a derivative of some other work‚Ä¶‚Äù The fact that Fox, Disney, SONY, insert generic big studio name, owns lots of stuff that it did not create has many implications.  But if there was a copyright on that work, and Disney paid for it, that still means that a transaction was made.  Disney found value in that work, purchased it.  The content creator wanted money, thought it equal to trade IP for money.  Win-Win.  Is it fair that George Lucas‚Äôs heirs for the next seven decades will own Star Wars and everything associated with it?  NO.  So I think there needs to be a balance.  And the lobbying power of these big companies is obviously stronger than the lobbying powers of the collective content creator counterparts (good use of alliteration), hence long statutory copyright terms.  But, in my opinion, the fundamental basis for this copyright is still sound.  The idea that if I create something that took effort, not only should I be able to be justly compensated for that production, but I should also have a financial motivation for creating it in the first place.  Without copyright, we‚Äôd be stuck with movies like The Human Centipede and music by Crispin Glover. (exaggeration, but you get my point)  I personally like the music, movies, videogames, tv shows, etc. that have been produced over the past 100 years and am a firm believer that the best of this stuff would not have been made if the world treated copyright the way China does.  I don‚Äôt think you are advocating that it does, but I do think that your approach would get us closer to that and farther away from what we have.  Is the system we have perfect?  Of course not.  I agree that terms need to be drastically shorter, fair use needs to be better defined, and in many cases, more permissive.  And statutory licensing and royalty fees should reflect what is fair not from the content distributor‚Äôs perspective, but for the content creator‚Äôs perspective.  That being said, this work in progress called the copyright act, as it struggles to adapt to emerging technologies, still rests on solid foundations.     Cheers to you again for having a reasonable conversation on reddit about copyright.

t5_2r5ng,tomhodgins,1329854112,"came here to post this very idea:  I have been wondering why, when Android has had the player app for MONTHS, even when they gave away an iPad2, iPad still has no player app. Rumour says it was held up on Apple's end, but arriving soon.  There's also a rumoured launch of iPad3 next month, and this wouldn't be the first time a feature that's possible on multiple devices has been artificially restricted for a sales point alone.  Siri, the flagship feature of the iPhone 4S, was originally designed to run on iPhone 3 and ran stable on 3GS, 4, and 4S. There was no reason the restrict it, but they have sold many phones this way.  Think of iMovie, it's only for iPhone4+ and iPad2 - even though editing videos is something iPad1 is fully capable of (and a simple hack lets you install it, so this has been proven to work well on iPad1).  We've got a missing iPad Onlive client, and an Onlive Desktop service 'coming soon'.  This is the year Windows¬Æ hits the cloud with Nivio, Onlive Desktop and more - having an iPad-exclusive app to do this (for a while) would be a huge selling feature for my *business* users looking for an iPad3. Also rumoured to have resolutions greater than most desktops, the iPad 3 would be the *best* way to view your computer over VNC or remote desktop.  I fear that the Onlive Player app and Onlive Desktop service will arrive for iPad to coincide with the iPad3 launch, and if it is also restricted for iPhone or iPad1,2 to be used solely as a selling feature, I will simply go out and buy Android.  I've already sunk hundreds of dollars into iPhone and iPad apps, but the reason I've liked Apple instead of Microsoft for an OS I can run Adobe's software on is because until now Apple's software has always been cheap and available, and they used that good software to sell hardware. Now they are getting lazy, buying technologies instead of developing them, and artificially restricting software in order to pump more hardware sales.  I don't play games, and Apple's value to me will drop significantly depending on how this iPad3 launch is handled. I think they know it too.",¬Æ

Instead he said, multiple times, on national TV interviews ""I didn't say 'black' I actually said 'blargh'""  He's playing to his base, a large part of which believes that black people have a poor work ethic, as a race, and that they are on welfare because they aren't trying not to be, or aren't smart enough to get a job, or because they are morally lax and can't keep a job due to unwanted pregnancies or drugs or gang violence.   And it doesn't matter that a higher percentage of black people are on welfare anyway, because in sheer numbers, they are a minority of welfare recipients.   People on welfare are most likely to be white. Most likely to be women. Most likely to be divorced. Most likely to have one child. Most likely own their house. Most likely to be in their 20s. Most likely to remain on benefits for less than two years.  So if Rick Santorum is going to talk about the *anecdotal* welfare recipient, he is going to talk about divorced, white, 20-something women with a child. Rural farmers. The heartland.

t5_2qh1i,crkhek56,1329930509,"One of those skillets saved my life.  A few months ago, I was up late at night getting a midnight snack when I heard a huge crash coming from my downstairs living room.  I cautiously peered down the stairs and could see a figure swiftly dart across the dark room.  At the time, I lived in the country and it would take at least 15 minutes for the cops to show up, so that option was thrown out the window.  I had to defend myself.    I ran downstairs and kicked that burglar in the balls.  Then I finished making my midnight snack using my Lodge Logic¬Æ cast iron skillet.  With a 12 inch diameter, this 2 inch deep, pre-seasoned beast of a skillet can make any amateur chef into the Iron Chef!

His stream will suck balls and be boring.   My stream may have low points, it is 24 hours I'm sorry :(  &gt;2. Only reason anyone cares is charity.   Thanks for caring at all  &gt;3. He doesnt have beta keys to hold over your heads and make you watch his attention whoring bullshit for them.   I don't have beta keys to hold over your head, and I'm sorry if you feel like people do that to you or anyone else. I think the act of sharing keys at all should be valued even if you have to watch a stream. I mean after all if you want a key that bad you probably aren't playing DotA2 :)  &gt;4. Hes not selling beta keys to donators like that other faggot.  Someone sold beta keys to charity? Is that like a charity auction? interesting...  &gt;So again ENJOY a completely horrible, never ever watch any other time stream and SUPPORT someone staying up 24 hours playing shittily at some video game for ""charity"" and stroking his ego.  Thanks for telling people to enjoy it? No I'm not the best at the game or the most entertaining but I'm making an effort. As for stroking my ego, well I'm not but would you consider this rant of yours an ego stroking of your own?  &gt;Because hosting a charity stream is the only way anyone would ever give 2 fucks, and its not like there will be shit all put into the stream, guests, or gameplay besides a boring 24 hour ""oh god hes really tired"".  I have reached out to guests and different types of game play like [Divine Courage](http://divinecourage.dy.fi/) matches and playing with other streamers and content producers.  &gt;I would support this if there was A SINGLE MERIT TO WATCHING HIS STREAM, if he was demon, fear, maelk, etc I would upvote and say fuck yes. If it was someone from complexity, they would stream, have guests, and donate the stream income to charity, I would be all for it.  Thanks for pointing out that I'm none of those people I was getting worried about the confusion. On a more serious note I would love for any of them to come on and cast/play/join me. I do not make any stream income and if I did it would go to charity but because I don't donations to it will be the way to go I'm sorry I couldn't fulfill your need in this way.  &gt;But this is a 0 effort, stay awake, poor quality charity bullshit and no one would give 2 fucks except omg charity must upvote cuz I can't think for myself.  You probably don't know what ""effort"" is as anyone taking time out of their lives to do something like this is far from 0. I work a full time job, it is not like I have all the time in the world to sit around and plan these things. :) Also telling people they can't think for themselves because they support charity is pretty baseless but alright :)  Finally: Thanks for taking the time to express your opinions and I'll try and make this more exciting than you think it will be not that it matters because you refuse to watch. So while you're enjoying your saturday I'll enjoy mine :) Have a wonderful weekend sir :)",‚ô•

I got paid ¬£71 yesterday. I had to go food shopping as we ran out of food on Monday and were eating very strange concoctions of food. Anyway I digress. I only bought essentials and my bill came to ¬£64. That leaves me with ¬£7 until Tuesday. My son has to get to college (3x a week)which is ¬£5 per day so already I'm ¬£8 short. My other son needs ¬£2 per day so now I'm ¬£18 short and it's my late Mums birthday on Sunday and because it's 1)her first birthday without her and 2) should have been her 60th we want to do something for her so I've had to borrow money which leaves me up shit street next week.  Yes I have Internet and yes I have a cell. It's common practice here now for everybody to have Internet. The schools require you to have it as the children's home work is online and my eldest needs it as he is doing IT LEVEL 3 diploma.  I also require a cell for my children as one has severe asthma and Aspergers  and the other has Crps and asthma. I also need one as I fall quite a lot and also need to be able to phone home.  And we don't have food banks here well not in my town anyway.  So please don't be judgemental or make pre-conceptions about people and priorities. What maybe a luxury to you is an essential to others. ,üåä

t5_2qhyh,BTownPhD,1330015332," It has barely been a couple of months so far since I bought my TGT and I have really enjoyed it.  Before the purchase, I was seriously considering the Garmin equivalent (310xt), but it a brand new TGT was much cheeper on amazon (HALF PRICE!).  But that was not the only selling point.  It came with the HRM and I picked up a cadence meter for my bike coming to a total cost of about $180.  Now if you are an Amazon Prime member you can save even more on the shipping and know that it is a quality purchase you have made.  Other selling points came from DCRainmaker &lt;http://www.dcrainmaker.com/2010/08/timex-ironman-gps-global-trainer-in.html&gt;  The review is the best so far, accurate, in depth and fair. The TGT It is universal with ANT+, so if you have any of those already (Garmin/Wahoo/Timex) it will sync up without a problem. The GPS works great too (or I am easily impressed). There were a lot of negative comments about the original firmware build but Timex has addressed this and put out a new easy to download/install firmware update. The day it came in the mail I updated the firmware and I haven‚Äôt really noticed any problems (except on rainy days).  Somewhere I came across the design and discovered that the GPS chip is actually right under the Start/Split button, which some watches burry beneath the screen.  I feel confident that this gives a better signal reliability but I am not a(n) mechanical/electrical engineer of any sort.  Inside the watch there are a lot of features, perhaps to many as there are tons I am still learning to learn how to use. Auto-start/stop, intervals, altimeter, pacers, cadence, power, alerts, indiglo¬Æ, multisport, navigate, and so many ways to configure on the watch or on your computer.  You have four screens that you can pretty much set to any combination of average/max/min HR, pace, altitude, split, distance and a few more I am forgetting. With all these things running at one time, the battery life is amazing, I charge it about once a week after using it for 5 or 6 workouts totaling about 6-8 hours of active GPS and or HRM and I still have 20-30% of the battery leftover. I have not tried my cadence meter yet (the weather sucks/I‚Äôm not that hardcore).  Now, the watch is big, people will notice it but big means easy to read screen even if you use the 4 screen split, and it feels surprisingly natural.  I put on a nicer watch to go out for Valentine's and my wrist felt naked and unbalanced.   The one problem I have had so far I have mentioned already though.  I was running late to a spin class, threw on my HRM and booted up the watch, clicked over to my bike/spin setting and pressed start/split and it froze.  I was distressed to say the least.  I finally found out how to restart it after applying several years of electronics use know-how (there just had to be someway to restart it, who wants a brick for a watch?). Later I found a number and called Timex to see why it froze, they said it happens and all you can do is manually reset it.  I was also informed that I would lose all of my data when I did that (I didn‚Äôt) but I wasn‚Äôt worried either as I download after every workout anyway.    I‚Äôm getting a little unorganized in my thoughts now but ‚Äì simply, it‚Äôs a good watch and a great run-tracker/keeper for an amazing price, especially if you have never used one before.  I might switch to a Garmin in a few years ‚Äì but only if I continue to grow more serious in my training.  The reason being that Garmin now has a watch that can do GPS tracking in open water.  Cool, but way out of my budget right now.  I‚Äôd be happy to answer any more specific questions too ‚Äì   Cheers!  TL/DR? it‚Äôs a good watch and a great run-tracker/keeper for an amazing price for the number of features, especially if you have never used one before. ",¬Æ

Everyone from politicians to hollywood is peddling this false idea of working your way up from two empty hands.

In fact I find it extremely offensive when someone says that people are poor because they don't try. The socio-economic factors behind poverty runs alot deeper than simply a lack of trying.

Aside, here's a [wiki article](http://pixar.wikia.com/Brave) about the film.  Plot:  Since ancient times, stories of epic battles and mystical legends have been passed through the generations across the rugged and mysterious Highlands of Scotland. In Brave, a new tale joins the lore when the courageous Merida (voice of Kelly Macdonald) confronts tradition, destiny and the fiercest of beasts. Merida is a skilled archer and impetuous daughter of King Fergus (voice of Billy Connolly) and Queen Elinor (voice of Emma Thompson). Determined to carve her own path in life, Merida defies an age-old custom sacred to the uproarious lords of the land: massive Lord MacGuffin (voice of Kevin McKidd), surly Lord Macintosh (voice of Craig Ferguson) and cantankerous Lord Dingwall (voice of Robbie Coltrane). Merida‚Äôs actions inadvertently unleash chaos and fury in the kingdom, and when she turns to an eccentric old Witch (voice of Julie Walters) for help, she is granted an ill-fated wish. The ensuing peril forces Merida to discover the meaning of true bravery in order to undo a beastly curse before it‚Äôs too late. Directed by Mark Andrews and Brenda Chapman, and produced by Katherine Sarafian, ‚ÄúBrave‚Äù is a grand adventure full of heart, memorable characters and the signature Pixar humor enjoyed by audiences of all ages. The film takes aim at theaters on June 22, 2012, and will be presented in Disney Digital 3D‚Ñ¢ in select theaters. [6]   ",‚Ñ¢

I'm so sorry about the loss of your father, and that things are generally on the downturn lately.  But your duty in life is to protect yourself and to get yourself through life successfully, safely, and happily.  Your dad would want you to take care of yourself, and so do we!  Keep up with the weed, even if it's only a temporary band-aid and not a long-term solution.  And visit a local clinic or mental health center to see about free counseling.

Most hard drives last a couple of years on average.  I've had some that lasted lots longer and I've had them smoke the day after the warranty expired.  (I've only had one (1) hard drive fail within warranty.) I once bought a hard drive, liked it a lot, and bought a duplicate a month later.  Several years down the road the first one died and a month later we were holding services for it's brother. Now _that's_ quality control...  Multiple mirrors are a good idea, and an offsite backup is even better.  I try to keep my newest disk as the mirror, the master disk is the next oldest.  If I wasn't so lazy and cheap I'd have a tertiary backup off site. But I'm a bad Ranma.  Which is why you should burn shows that are important to you to DVDs; which are moderately ephemeral themselves. I've had DVD backups that failed before the hard drive that held their files failed.  They seem to last longer if you don't buy the absolute cheapest brands (I've had good luck with Sony) and store them in a clean, dry, dark place. Here's a PROTIP‚Ñ¢ for you folks: The coatings on the non-plastic side of a DVD-R are soluble in cat urine!    So curb those catgirls kiddies...  I try to cycle through my DVD-Rs and re-image them to fresh media every few years, but I'm woefully behind.  Regular old store bought DVDs are actually a pretty reasonable solution, if you are willing to wait for the thin packs, look for them used, or wait for really good sales; especially if you value your time as worth more than minimum wage.  Of course it helps if the shows you want to preserve are actually available. I'm still waiting for some genius at Funimation to license *Yokohama Shopping Diary* and *Potemayo*.  I don't have any experience with blu-ray disks, but I assume they are they are similarly stable, though more expensive.  I will also point out that even store bought DVDs, protected in their factory keep cases, can deteriorate if stored improperly.  They are supposed to last a hundred years, but I've had them fail in humid environments, especially of they've been dropped or temperature shocked.

I mean, it enables instantaneous communications with people from all over the planet, fosters the sharing and exploration of the entirety of human knowledge, so on and so forth. Also it gives us naked women on command. What I'm getting at is that the internet is, in my view, really really important. It's an excellent business tool, but it's also an incredibly game-changing social tool that changes the way people interact.  It wasn't designed specifically for that purpose, but that's sort of what it became. There aren't very many mechanisms in place, aside from those the free market provides us, to preserve its capacity to fulfill that social role. Something this revolutionary seems too important to let it be picked apart in the typical capitalist market manner.  You may have been joking, but perhaps a tax-supported network *wouldn't* be such a terrible idea. Maybe it would. I think that we, as a people, have gotten a taste of communication of this magnitude and we're not going to be happy to let it go. One way or another we'll change along with the world; either by learning to accept that everything going through this amazing, huge, integral communication channel will be potentially 100% public - or by somehow bucking off the profitability of such a development.

t5_2qh1i,GCanuck,1330106266,"Biodegradable / Compostable: What It Really Means  There are an awful lot of product claims being made with regard to biodegradable, compostable and degradable properties. It is fairly easy to become confused on exactly what is fact and what is spin. The first step is to define what these words actually mean. There are of course definitions that can be looked up and some even have definitions written by the ASTM (American Standards for Testing Materials) which we'll cover. But what is most important is what the average consumer thinks these terms mean. The American Chemistry Council did a study on this exact topic. They concluded that most people feel a product is biodegradable if it is able to break down naturally (on its own) in 1 year or less and leave nothing behind, or completely disappear. The FTC (Federal Trade Commission) has a very similar view on a biodegradable definition. They state that the ""...materials should break down in a reasonably short period of time after customary disposal.""  It is very important to get the facts on products that make a biodegradable claim. What are the conditions necessary for biodegradation to occur? There are some foamed polystyrene products on the market right now that are claiming they will biodegrade in a landfill environment. Some even offer a certificate signed by a company official, certifying the product will biodegrade in a landfill. According to the FTC however, in landfills, materials degrade very slowly, if at all. This is because modern landfills are designed, according to law, to keep out sunlight, air and moisture. This helps prevent pollutants from the garbage from getting into the air and drinking water, and slows the decomposition of the trash. In Dr. William Rathje's book entitled ""Rubbish,"" he sites that ""The truth is, however, that the dynamics of a modern landfill are very nearly the opposite of what most people think...Well designed and managed landfills seem to be far more apt to preserve their contents for posterity than transform them into humus or mulch. They are not vast composters: rather they are vast mummifiers."" In his book, Dr. Rathje talks about doing excavations on 15 landfills throughout North America. **From those digs, they found 40 year old newspapers that were still legible, 5 year old lettuce and a 15 year old hot dog. From these studies it seems fairly clear that even organic materials take a very long time to break down in landfills let alone plastic or other items.**  Compostable product claims are another hot topic today. Once again the American Chemistry Council surveyed consumers to find out what their definition of compostable is. Their study cited that most respondents felt that compostable items can be put back into the ground to make soil, mulch or fertilizer that can be used in a garden or around the home. They also go on to state that the chief attribute of compostable materials is that the decomposition is beneficial to the earth which stands in opposition to their biodegradable beliefs that materials simply disappear completely.  The ASTM also has a definition for compostable plastic products which some municipalities have mandated as their rule and guideline that packaging must meet. The ASTM D6400 definition is quite lengthy and very specific. It covers such points as time frames for decomposition and left over materials acceptable. You could find the entire ASTM D6400 definition on their website and read all the pages, but if you are looking for compostable products, we would recommend simply looking for products that carry the BPI logo. BPI is the Biodegradable Products Institute and is a not for profit organization that promotes the use of compostable materials and organics recovery via composting. They have a third party certification process that will verify if a manufacturers products meet the ASTM definition for compostability. Our Harvest¬Æ Fiber brand of products does meet these criteria and carries the BPI logo. This means that a third party has verified that all Harvest¬Æ Fiber; products will turn to compost within the time frame specified in the ASTM definition. It is important to note that these products must be sent to a professionally managed composting facility in order to be composted correctly. They will not compost in a back yard compost heap. They will however completely compost at a professionally run facility. We have also sought and received verification from such a facility, that our products will do what we say they will. To find a composting facility near you, click here.  It is safe to say that, from the facts listed above, nothing biodegrades in a landfill in a reasonable period of time.  Until there are tighter rules with regard to marketing claims for biodegradable and compostable products, it is really up to the consumer to do their homework. Simply because a product may be made from organic sources, one cannot assume it will biodegrade or even compost properly. Ask for third party verifications proving the claims are valid. If none exist, then the consumer must make their own decision. ",¬Æ

She came in ‚Ä¶ and there was a hand sticking out of the cervix. Clearly the membranes had ruptured and she was trying to deliver‚Ä¶ . There was a heart rate, and [we called] the ethics committee, and they [said], ‚ÄúNope, can't do anything.‚Äù So we had to send her to [the university hospital]‚Ä¶ . You know, these things don't happen that often, but from what I understand it, it's pretty clear. Even if mom is very sick, you know, potentially life threatening, can't do anything.  &gt;In residency, Dr P and Dr H had been taught to perform uterine evacuation or labor induction on patients during inevitable miscarriage whether fetal heart tones were present or not. In their new Catholic-owned hospital environment, such treatment was considered a prohibited abortion by the governing ethics committee because the fetus is still alive and the patient is not yet experiencing ‚Äúa life-threatening pathology‚Äù such as sepsis. Physicians such as Dr H found that in some cases, transporting the patient to another hospital for dilation and curettage (D&amp;C) was quicker and safer than waiting for the fetal heartbeat to stop while trying to stave off infection and excessive blood loss. Dr B, an obstetrician‚Äìgynecologist working in an academic medical center, described how a Catholic-owned hospital in her western urban area asked her to accept a patient who was already septic. When she received the request, she recommended that the physician from the Catholic-owned hospital perform a uterine aspiration there and not further risk the health of the woman by delaying her care with the transport.  &gt;&gt;    Because the fetus was still alive, they wouldn't intervene. And she was hemorrhaging, and they called me and wanted to transport her, and I said, ‚ÄúIt sounds like she's unstable, and it sounds like you need to take care of her there.‚Äù And I was on a recorded line, I reported them as an EMTALA [Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act] violation. And the physician [said], ‚ÄúThis isn't something that we can take care of.‚Äù And I [said], ‚ÄúWell, if I don't accept her, what are you going to do with her?‚Äù [He answered], ‚ÄúWe'll put her on a floor [i.e., admit her to a bed in the hospital instead of keeping her in the emergency room]; we'll transfuse her as much as we can, and we'll just wait till the fetus dies.‚Äù  &gt;Ultimately, Dr B chose to accept the patient to spare her unnecessary suffering and harm, but she saw this case as a form of ‚Äúpatient dumping,‚Äù because the patient was denied treatment and transported while unstable.  snip  &gt;Some doctors have decided to take matters into their own hands. In the following case, the refusal of the hospital ethics committee to approve uterine evacuation not only caused significant harm to the patient but compelled a perinatologist, Dr S, now practicing in a nonsectarian academic medical center, to violate protocol and resign from his position in an urban northeastern Catholic-owned hospital.  &gt;    I'll never forget this; it was awful‚ÄîI had one of my partners accept this patient at 19 weeks. The pregnancy was in the vagina. It was over‚Ä¶ . And so he takes this patient and transferred her to [our] tertiary medical center, which I was just livid about, and, you know, ‚Äúwe're going to save the pregnancy.‚Äù So of course, I'm on call when she gets septic, and she's septic to the point that I'm pushing pressors on labor and delivery trying to keep her blood pressure up, and I have her on a cooling blanket because she's 106 degrees. And I needed to get everything out. And so I put the ultrasound machine on and there was still a heartbeat, and [the ethics committee] wouldn't let me because there was still a heartbeat. This woman is dying before our eyes. I went in to examine her, and I was able to find the umbilical cord through the membranes and just snapped the umbilical cord and so that I could put the ultrasound‚Äî‚ÄúOh look. No heartbeat. Let's go.‚Äù She was so sick she was in the [intensive care unit] for about 10 days and very nearly died‚Ä¶ . She was in DIC [disseminated intravascular coagulopathy]‚Ä¶ . Her bleeding was so bad that the sclera, the white of her eyes, were red, filled with blood‚Ä¶ . And I said, ‚ÄúI just can't do this. I can't put myself behind this. This is not worth it to me.‚Äù That's why I left",¬©

(Matthew 5:17-18, NIV)  Some Christians claim that his death and resurrection ""fulfill"" this. That is bullshit for one simple reason: last time I checked, Heaven and Earth haven't passed away.  &gt;He answered them, ‚ÄúAnd why do you break God‚Äôs commandment because of your tradition? For God said:    *Honor your father and your mother;* and, *The one who speaks evil of father or mother must be put to death.*  &gt; But you say, ‚ÄòWhoever tells his father or mother, ‚ÄúWhatever benefit you might have received from me is a gift committed to the temple‚Äù‚Äî  he does not have to honor his father.‚Äô In this way, you have revoked God‚Äôs word because of your tradition.

t5_2sokd,ninoffmaniak,1330212397,"&gt;n other words he is flying so fast, he keeps missing the ground.  This is an excerpt from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.   How To Fly  ¬© by Douglas Adams  There is an art, it says, or rather, a knack to flying. The knack lies in learning how to throw yourself at the ground and miss. Pick a nice day, [The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy] suggests, and try it.    The first part is easy. All it requires is simply the ability to throw yourself forward with all your weight, and the willingness not to mind that it's going to hurt.    That is, it's going to hurt if you fail to miss the ground. Most people fail to miss the ground, and if they are really trying properly, the likelihood is that they will fail to miss it fairly hard.    Clearly, it is the second part, the missing, which presents the difficulties.    One problem is that you have to miss the ground accidentally. It's no good deliberately intending to miss the ground because you won't. You have to have your attention suddenly distracted by something else when you're halfway there, so that you are no longer thinking about falling, or about the ground, or about how much it's going to hurt if you fail to miss it.    It is notoriously difficult to prize your attention away from these three things during the split second you have at your disposal. Hence most people's failure, and their eventual disillusionment with this exhilarating and spectacular sport.    If, however, you are lucky enough to have your attention momentarily distracted at the crucial moment by, say, a gorgeous pair of legs (tentacles, pseudopodia, according to phyllum and/or personal inclination) or a bomb going off in your vicinty, or by suddenly spotting an extremely rare species of beetle crawling along a nearby twig, then in your astonishment you will miss the ground completely and remain bobbing just a few inches above it in what might seem to be a slightly foolish manner.    This is a moment for superb and delicate concentration. Bob and float, float and bob. Ignore all consideration of your own weight simply let yourself waft higher. Do not listen to what anybody says to you at this point because they are unlikely to say anything helpful. They are most likely to say something along the lines of ""Good God, you can't possibly be flying!"" It is vitally important not to believe them or they will suddenly be right.    Waft higher and higher. Try a few swoops, gentle ones at first, then drift above the treetops breathing regularly.    DO NOT WAVE AT ANYBODY.    When you have done this a few times you will find the moment of distraction rapidly easier and easier to achieve.    You will then learn all sorts of things about how to control your flight, your speed, your maneuverability, and the trick usually lies in not thinking too hard about whatever you want to do, but just allowing it to happen as if it were going to anyway.    You will also learn about how to land properly, which is something you will almost certainly screw up, and screw up badly, on your first attempt.    There are private clubs you can join which help you achieve the all-important moment of distraction. They hire people with surprising bodies or opinions to leap out from behind bushes and exhibit and/or explain them at the critical moments. Few genuine hitchhikers will be able to afford to join these clubs, but some may be able to get temporary employment at them.",¬©

I hate you for making me defend Ron Paul!  http://thenewamerican.com/usnews/politics/10608-ron-paul-introduces-bill-to-repeal-ndaas-indefinite-detention  http://www.antiwar.com/blog/2008/06/24/ron-paul-on-the-wiretap-bill/  &gt; The main reason I oppose this latest version is that it still clearly violates the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution by allowing the federal government to engage in the bulk collection of American citizens√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ communications without a search warrant. That US citizens can have their private communication intercepted by the government without a search warrant is anti-American, deeply disturbing, and completely unacceptable.   &gt; Why do you think he doesn't want to make gay marriage legal, he wants to leave it up to the states? Because he thinks states rights should be above civil rights.  WRONG!   &gt; In a 2007 interview, Paul said that he supported the right of gay couples to marry, so long as they didn't ""impose"" their relationship on anyone else, on the grounds of supporting voluntary associations.[133] He also said, ""Matter of fact, I'd like to see all governments out of the marriage question. I don't think it's a state function, I think it's a religious function."" Paul has stated that in a best case scenario, governments would enforce contracts and grant divorces but otherwise have no say in marriage.[134] He has also said he doesn't want to interfere in the free association of two individuals in a social, sexual, and religious sense.[135][136] When asked if he was supportive of gay marriage, Paul responded, ""I am supportive of all voluntary associations and people can call it whatever they want.""[135]   I actually agree with this position. Let everyone enter whatever contracts they want, if religions want to discriminate go for it, I know a few ministers who are more than happy to marry gay people.  &gt; Same thing goes for abortion, contraception, freedom of religion, education, etc. He wants the states to take over all of that, and make it so the Federal government is not allowed to protect your civil rights. (If you don't like it, tell your family and friends goodbye, quit your job, and move to a state that doesn't discriminate against you, and start all over.... because, you know, it's easy to do that and all)  Damn you for making me defend Ron Paul, but you are flat out WRONG on at least some of your positions!  &gt; Paul has asserted that a right to privacy in the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution protects the use of contraceptives[163][164] and that the Interstate Commerce Clause protects the sale of contraceptives.[163]  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_positions_of_Ron_Paul#States.27_rights  &gt; Did you not read his rant against the Lawrence V. Texas? I know for a fact you haven't because he straight up SAYS the federal government should NOT protect an individual's civil rights if they're violated by a state.  Citation needed  &gt; And really, you said he's bat-shit insane... I think that putting states rights over civil rights is one of those bat-shit insane policies.

t5_2t5ay,DrVelociraptorMD,1330232177,"Respectfully, I have a couple small issues with your theory:  It relies heavily on the supposition that intelligence ‚Üî arcane ability, which isn't entirely accurate.  Your stance on Bretons, particularly, seems to uphold this idea, when their proclivity towards magic is actually due to their elven blood.  I would also like to note that they're [obsessed with their own history](http://uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Wayrest,_Jewel_Of_The_Bay), which is understandable since [the oldest structure known](http://uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Direnni_Tower) is in High Rock.  There's also the idea that because a race isn't 'biased' towards their own culture, they aren't intelligent or educated, which strikes me as... strange, because every culture in Tamriel is arguably very heavily biased‚Äîin fact, I don't think I can actually think of a province that isn't.  I think the bias that you talk about tends to make the various cultures more educated rather than less, but it's about their own culture, not the outside provinces'.  The fact that Khajiits tend to be criminals when found outside of Elswyr shouldn't be attributed to the possibility of illiteracy, because I don't think there's actually any evidence to support that.  I think it's rather because they're naturally talented at thievery, and every where they go, they tend to be ostracised by the local population because of hearsay and racial prejudice.  The Argonians see the same kind of prejudice (not only in Skyrim‚Äîbeing the obvious example‚Äîbut across Tamriel as a whole), as do the Orcs.  The difference between Khajiit/Argonians and Orcs is that Orcs aren't naturally talented thieves.  Both Khajiit and Argonians are.  Orcs tend to become mercenaries or stay inside of their makeshift cities because that's what they're good at: being warriors.  On the topic of illiteracy: a lack of formal education doesn't necessarily entail that a race is less intelligent than any other race.  The cultures where you don't see formal education also tend to be the more nomadic ones, and even then, they compensate for that by making up with practical knowledge.  I'm sure that a Bosmer would know much more about the kinds of flora it's safe to make a restorative potion out of than an Altmer would.  Redguards have an acute knowledge of agriculture and astronomy thanks to having to survive the desert and coming from Yokuda initially, Orcs have an impressive ability to pass down their history and religion through oral tradition, and Khajiit have shown a remarkable sense of astronomy and the lunar phases since it's so integral to their society.  Something important to note is Altmeri culture.  The Altmer place a huge cultural emphasis on perfection, since they believe themselves the descendants of the gods and are actively striving to restore what they believe to be their divinity (or immortality, anyway).  Of course they're going to be more educated, because there is so much pressure to be so.  Additionally, they live for so long and experience so much more history first-hand that it's hard for them not to be comparatively more educated.  They have time to record every last bit of their history in library upon library, and to master entire fields of magic and history.  If they dedicate their lives to a subject, they can spend hundreds upon hundreds of years discovering every little shred there is to discover about it and still have time to write it down so that future generations can benefit for it.  So, it's not hard to imagine that a 600-year-old Altmer would know much more about history and magic than a 40-year-old Imperial.  A note on the Dunmer: in all of the games so far, Morrowind has had more libraries than any of the other provinces.  They're a very educated people, both historically and magically speaking.  I don't think they would know necessarily more about all Daedric Princes (for instance, I wouldn't expect the average Dunmer to know everything there is to know about Hermaeus Mora or Peryite), but they would certainly know more about Azura and Boethiah.  It's also important to remember that many Tamriellic cultures venerate daedra to some extent.  I would expect an Orc to be able to tell someone a lot more about Malacath than I would a Dunmer to be able to, in any case.",‚Üî

t5_2qhsj,technoc,1330267358,"I had symptoms of gastroparesis before being diagnosed T1 and have seen the worst of it--7 day hospital trip.  The onsets were an intense pressure in my stomach that expanded to my chest after a large (at the time acceptable and normal) meal that resulted (sometimes after hours of fighting it) in purging the food up that had evidently just sat in my gut, not breaking down at all.  The hospital trip I mentioned was extremely unpleasant and came 6 or so months after starting insulin and a gluten free diet as I had found out Celiac was likely another auto-immune condition I'd have.  There were many days without any food (we're talking about Boost shakes and jello that wouldn't pass here), and cycles of gagging to the point of exhaustion--well past anything, including bile, coming up--it was a real test of my tolerance for the whole situation.  After having an endoscopy and finding out that I tested positive for Celiac, we waited around for my stomach to function so I could get the hell out of there.  No amount of prescribed anti-nausea medicine or Domperidone (Motilium‚Ñ¢) changed what I was experiencing.  We ended up reading online about a procedure where Botox gets injected into the duodenum (during endoscopy) and could allow for the system to act as it rightly should.  Thankfully, after having that done I began eating and passing small and eventually regular sized meals.  Had it not taken, I was scheduled to have a PEJ tube (a makeshift orifice that allows a machine to pump liquid nutrients directly into the small intestine) the following morning =|  I no longer gorge--like is so widely accepted if not encouraged in our (US) society.  I'm not sure how gluten played a role in the whole experience, but I do recall one of the many GI specialist that consulted with me while there pretty much accusing me of breaking stride with the diet and blaming that for my stomach shutting down.  I explained that I had made no conscious decision to consume any such food(s), but perhaps I had done so mistakenly.  I've since made such mistakes catching myself mid-waffle or soft taco etc. having little to no digestive recourse--never vomiting, that's for sure.  I did recently, over the holidays, go off the deep end and eat like a hyper-active 17 year old.  Woke up in the middle of the night and had to void the stomach to relieve the pressure.  Not glutenous, just gluttonous :L    I hope your cough (and health overall) improves.  I never had that issue, but would've hated it atop everything else; esp. the reflux!",‚Ñ¢

This entire post is complete nonsense and contains no actual content whatsoever.  &gt;To clarify, I want so badly to be wrong. But as an owner of 3 businesses myself. I must say that if money is a driving force.  Welcome to nearly every video game ever?  Besides some indie games and a handful of retail games, making money is the reason why games are made.  &gt;They are playing it perfectly by the book.  Delaying the game to completely redo the skills system several times in order to make it better is ""playing it by the book""?  No, playing it by the book would have been to release D2 again with some small improvements.  Is that what you wanted?  It sort of seems like it.  &gt;They are milking WoW as long as possible.  I think you may be confusing ""milking"" with ""supporting"".  People want to play WoW, so Blizzard continues to release content.  You're acting like there's something malicious going on here.  I'm assuming you're trying to complain about the pet store based on something you posted later in this post, but here's some interesting information: that pet that you linked was the first one added to the store in the course of five months.  If Blizzard was bombarding players with collectible in-game shit that costs real money, I could agree that they are milking the game a bit, but they would have to be doing something like releasing new things *at least* monthly.  &gt;Because D3 will not make as much money and the consumer base heavily overlaps.  Do you have a source for that?  &gt;It's tremendously boring and overly simplistic. Every sacrifice has been made to cater this game to larger and larger markets. Blizzard has abandoned the mantra of producing the best games, for producing the biggest piles of cash.  How so?  Such as?  Examples?  &gt;Hoping that all this console crap and the D3 beta was a joke and the real game no one has seen.  ........  &gt;In Summary, I fully expect them to release a version for the iPad, It's that bad.   Because games that aren't only on the PC are inherently bad.  &gt;EDIT: This post angered a lot of fan boys.  No it didn't, you have one reply and quite a few upvotes.  What are you talking about?  &gt;Doesn't matter how much more HP they give monsters in later levels you only have 4-6 buttons.  You only had two in Diablo 2.  &gt;They have recently removed more complexity. Runewords gone and skill tree choices.  Man, where to start...  First of all, complexity itself is not interesting when you don't have many choices.  Yeah, there were a lot of skills, but not choosing a cookie-cutter optimal build was gimping yourself, as the game seemed to be balanced around optimal builds, or at least having ridiculous enough gear to carry your weird-ass build through hell.  For my Blizzard sorceress, my build required putting a point into Warmth, a couple more to get Teleport, and then just maxing out Cold Mastery, Blizzard, and its synergies.  Complex?  Yea, talents receive bonuses for having points in somewhat unrelated talents, making your character extremely powerful if you have a well thought-out spec.  Fun?  I'd say no.  There were no choices, unless you wanted to get a weak version of some random spell while also weakening your main ability.  That's just the Blizzard Sorc build, but most of them were pretty similar to that from what I remember.  An Orb Sorc did the same thing as a Blizzard Sorc, but you maxed out Frozen Orb which only had one synergy.  Your leftover points were mostly spent in Blizzard, since that would do much more damage than spells from other trees would since you maxed Cold Mastery and are likely wearing +%cold skill damage gear.  There was also ""meteorb"" type builds to get around immunities, but those weren't entirely necessary at higher gear levels.  I mainly played Paladins though, and their choices were even less so than Sorceresses.  For a Zeal Pally, you maxed out Zeal, Sacrifice (a Zeal synergy), Fanaticism, and Holy Shield (since there was nothing else to use them on).  Your other skill points?  They literally didn't matter.  You would never use them.  Your left click is bound to Zeal, and your right click to Fanaticism.  Changing either is bad in pretty much every circumstance, unless you are buffing yourself with Holy Shield.  Smiters had it worse, you only maxed Smite, Holy Shield, and Fanaticism.  As characters generally reached level 80 at least, you had 20+ worthless points.  Well, you could spend them on the Resist auras for a bit of passive max resistance, but that's it.  What I'm trying to get at is that the skill trees didn't really offer you choices.  You picked the skill you wanted to base your build around, you maxed it out, you maxed out the synergies, or else your character was pathetic.  It wasn't very fun.  The skill system in Diablo 3, however, is fun.  You get 6 skills at a time from a choice of around 25-30 total, as well as 3 passive skills, of which there are 15.  Every skill is useful in some way, so you actually have to make some tough choices with every build.  In addition to that, every skill has 6 runes that modify it in a usually pretty significant way.  I don't know about you, but to me that sounds far and away more interesting than having one or two main skills and the rest of your choices going straight to slightly increasing the damage of those skills.  And Runewords... if you had actually played the beta, you would know that crafting operates in almost the same fashion.  You acquire materials, through either salvaging random magic items or trading, then you craft them into an item with some variable predetermined stats as well as some random effects.  The way Runewords worked is you acquired materials, through either finding them or trading, then you put them together into an item with some variable predetermined stats.  Having the crafted items always contain some random effects makes each item unique, something that the Runeword system completely failed at.  Personally I am looking forward to seeing people wear gear besides Enigma and Fortitude.  Also, what do you mean ""removed recently?""  Runewords were never in the game, and skill trees were removed a while ago.  I don't think you've actually played the beta.  &gt;FYI - I tried to get people to cancel all their WoW Account last march so that they would be forced to release the game before the console edit.  .............what.  How in the world did you get the idea that Blizzard would rush out an unfinished game a year ahead of schedule because some other game of theirs that was most likely expected to lose some subscribers lost some subscribers?  &gt;Q1 Earning report look really BAD last ditch effort to boost investor confidence. Expect early to Mid-March.  Yea, that isn't going to happen.  In the Q4 conference we learned that [2011 was the one of the most successful years ever for Activision Blizzard](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1pNf_AimQQ).  The chances of everything suddenly going to shit three months later is basically nil.  D3 is already planned for a May/June launch anyway.  &gt;However if people are still buying WoW pandas and World of Warcraft¬Æ Pet: Guardian Cub!!! They will delay the release until revenues decrease and stock price goes down.  The panda pet is more than a year old, I don't think many people are buying it still.  And the pet you linked is almost 4 months old.  Delaying the game further is unlikely, as Blizzard is planning on having 3 big releases this year, IIRC.  D3 is expected in Q2, the WoW expansion in Q3, and the Starcraft expansion in Q4.  Or maybe WoW and SC switched, I don't remember.  Delaying one game means some releases will overlap, which means there will likely be potential consumers of both products who are forced into purchasing only one or the other.  I think you are the guy who said Blizzard games share their customer base, so you would know about how that wouldn't be a good thing.  &gt;--- Currently no Incentive to release D3 --- https://www.google.com/finance?client=ob&amp;q=NASDAQ:ATVI  I don't know enough about stocks to understand what you're getting at here.  &gt;http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2012/02/25/why-im-still-long-activision-blizzard.aspx  This article is terrible.  It claims that work has recently been started on the real money auction house, when it has in fact been finished for a few months.  It also heavily implies that the loss of WoW subscribers has directly resulted in Blizzard putting effort into ""Titan"", when it actually began development in 2007 at the latest.  You could figure out those things through Google.  This guy doesn't really seem to be worth listening to.  But besides that, the whole point of his article is that Activision Blizzard will be successful through releasing a lot of shit and adapting to the market. You are saying that they will not release new shit because WoW is still successful.

t5_2qh03,nosut,1330295258,Gaming...laptop....No such thing. Certainly you can play games on a laptop however when it comes down to it the mobile GPUs just are not really cut out for anything great.   This laptop is going to cost what? $1700+? Yet even on BF3 which is already out the NVIDIA¬Æ GeForce¬Æ GT 555M 2GB DDR5 can only play it on medium (above 30FPS).  low:   49.2  fps   med.: 32.3  fps  high:  24.5  fps  ultra:  9.8  fps  For that price you could build an epic high end machine or even like 3 middle range desktop systems. You could make 3 middle range systems for $500 a pop then sell them for more then you made them.  Plus the inability to upgrade this means even if you can play things now it will be out of date an useless within a short period of time. ,¬Æ

t5_2qzb6,Sacheverell_,1330302345,"I could probably answer that better - I am Sacheverell, editor in chief of the Forum, and responsible for front-page content &amp; news.  Nice to meet you!  :)  Let's look for a second at what Digital Diamonds are - user-made videos, right?  What those videos are - an LP, a tutorial, an amazing build etc - are all things we like bringing to the community's attention.  While I can't speak for the news/round-up vids, I can say that what made me start the Spotlights channel was a desire to do this very thing a little better than before - give builders, map makers etc. a chance to be seen by our rather substantial viewer-base where they might not have had a chance to otherwise.  One of my goals with the channel is to give those under-the-radar creators a chance to shine.  People like Sparklez, Yogs etc. already have a massive following, and odds are people will go looking for their stuff anyway.  That's a not a bad thing - they're popular for a reason! - but the fact is, they don't need help getting off the ground; they're insanely popular already.  :)  I've never shut out the idea of spotlighting community videos - in fact, I'd really enjoy the opportunity to do so again.  What I'd like to do is have those same relative unknowns get their videos seen on my channel  and front-page, to give them a bit of a boost.  I make it a point to credit everyone involved where possible, because I want them to have a chance to shine on their own.  Once I've given them some exposure, it's up to them to make it happen going forward, though.  Will DDs ever be spotlighted the way they used to be?  Yes.  When?  ""soon‚Ñ¢"" - there are some things I'm waiting on before I start putting them up again, and once that happens, I'll gladly put them out there.  I've never been closed to people's ideas on the subject of content, but since hardly anyone comes to me about it, I have to assume that they enjoy what's been presented so far.  What would you like to see?",‚Ñ¢

t5_2qh03,nosut,1330305584,"&gt;It's more like $2,800.  In which case you could build a monster machine or what 4-6 mid range machines that you could sell at profit?  &gt;And yes, there is such a thing as a gaming laptop. I'm using one at this very moment.  No there is not. You are using an overpriced laptop that you happen to game on. Just because it has a ""dedicated"" GPU its still a mobile GPU which is utter crap.  &gt;Can easily play BF3 on a mix of med and high at around 45FPS and plays everything else just fine on high+. Only cost me $1,400.   I spent like $600 less almost 2 years ago on my build at it can max out BF3 with 60+ FPS so I have no idea why you are proud of getting ripped off.  &gt;May not be able to upgrade it, but it has been of more use than my desktop has since I can carry it everywhere.  In which case you will have to purchase an entirely new laptop in a year or so because yours can not play any newer games. The big draw for PC gaming? The graphics. If you cant beat a console with the computer then you lose one of the main reasons for the computer.  Also just because you can carry it anywhere does not mean much. I had a laptop that I could play old games. I took the thing everywhere. Problem is just because you bring it somewhere does not make it good for gaming. Another big draw of the PC keyboard and mouse. I laptop does not have a full keyboard or an actual mouse. Yes you can get USB for both but that means its not so portable. You have to get the space and actually set it up. You lose a lot of the reason the laptop is good.  &gt;And the notion that computers become out of date and useless in a short period of time is heavily overused and false. Yeah, we have big jumps in graphics every couple of years, but devs are staying with lower spec requirements lately because it leads to more sales.  GIANT flaw with your argument as I stated before the CURRENT mobile GPU ""NVIDIA¬Æ GeForce¬Æ GT 555M 2GB DDR5"" can hardly play BF3(which was released months ago). That means that the lower spec requirements you are talking about devs matching with are already closing in on those mobile GPUs. Within a year they will be the minimum if not damn close to it.   So yes you are right that they ight not go out of date so quickly but you need to remember a few things.  1. Devs are matching current DESKTOP GPUs NOT laptop GPUs which are far worse.   2. If the newest laptop GPUs can only play a game that is already 4 months old on medium then what about in another 4-8 months? New games might only run on low if at all.",¬Æ

Certainly the drafters of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, both replete with references to God, would be aghast at the federal government‚Äôs hostility to religion.  The establishment clause of the First Amendment was simply intended to forbid the creation of an official state church like the Church of England, not to drive religion out of public life.  Except it's right there in Amendment numero uno:  &gt; **Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof**; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.  Paul in that same article later goes on to say:  &gt; This is the real reason the collectivist Left hates religion: Churches as institutions compete with the state for the people‚Äôs allegiance, and many devout people put their faith in God before their faith in the state.  You tell me how that is supposed to be received. I read it to mean, ""The Church should play an equal role with, if not entirely supplant, the state."" If that isn't a big fuck-you to the Establishment Clause, I don't know what is.  The founding fathers were more secular than not, however they understood the religious character of the amalgam of colonies that was soon to become its own nation. So as not to alienate any one colony, or any one township within a colony, the language was restricted as you now see it. Jefferson, for instance, was adamant about the separation; Paul isn't even factually correct in his assertions.  Paul's stance, basically, is to throw his hands up and say, ""Do as you please!"" It's classic social-libertarian. The problem is that, in the more religious areas of the US (read: the more religiously intolerant areas), this is a green-light to populist religious sentiment in state and local levels of government (read: state-approved religiously motivated persecution).  And this is a Bad Thing‚Ñ¢.",‚Ñ¢

t5_2qzb6,iampaulanthony,1330403632,"Interesting perspective.  In general, I personally believe that copyright terms are too long as is.  They're meant to compensate authors and creators in order to further their creation of more work which provides more cultural input to their communities.  ¬© wasn't originally designed to run on for generations and compensate authors surviving families.  It doesn't encourage the creation of new works, rather the opposite...only protecting older works.  Not enough balance there.  Creators should be encouraged to create, not the opposite.

t5_2qlit,Roark,1330404087,"Agree with almost everything, just an insignificant bone to pick.  Terminology is important... 'pronation' is not at all a bad thing. In fact, it's the main biomechanical process by which we can attenuate shock upon impact. An inward rotation of the foot allows the impact forces to be borne by the arch, stored through windlass in the plantar fascia, and returned upon propulsion. Pronation is a good thing, and we do not wish to prevent it. 'Overpronation' is the collapse you are describing, and Vibram themselves agrees with your take. From their site:  &gt;For some over-pronators (people whose feet tend to flatten during full weight-bearing exercise), Vibram FiveFingers¬Æ footwear will be too much of an abrupt change in biomechanics. We always recommend what we call a micro progression into Vibram FiveFingers. The too-much-too-soon phenomenon can be a problem for anyone's foot. In the case of severe over-pronators, Vibram FiveFingers might not be a wise choice for weight-bearing activities. Over-pronators will definitely benefit from some focused rehabilitation and foot-specific exercises before wearing any minimalist footwear.  Like you said:  &gt;I know that small amounts of barefoot running on grass at the end of my runs has helped increase foot strength and improved form.  In the industry, we want everyone to experience this. Proprioception is vital to healthy, successful runners; you can't mitigate impact without a feel for the ground. I love that minimalism, and Vibram (fads notwithstanding), have brought the focus back to this. But for God's sake, people, *MODERATION*..",¬Æ

Ultimately, this presents itself as a problem with _your_ site, not with the author's choice; in other words, **you** are responsible for forcing us to register to download the code since **you** created the site feature that supports that. Nothing is more frustrating than having a lead on something (a Google hit, a link from a co-worker, etc.) and then being stonewalled by the registration screen.  I know it's part of your design, but that design died with web 1.0. Nobody wants to register, and posted code should be open-source and easily accessible. For reference, the code that my co-worker linked to was ¬© some random dude, but it didn't matter in the end as the code was crap anyways (waste of time to register and download....), and the site is generally....still, even after UI updates....stuck in the 90's.

t5_2qpol,GodOfAtheism,1330450232,"/u/willywonka159  The Weekly Sagan  16 February 2012  Silicon Valley Christian (Finally) Arrested  SAN FRANCISO - In an event that has been sweeping the country ‚Äì mostly San Francisco, but the whole nation, really ‚Äì user Frankfusion has finally been arrested and charged for involuntary offending. This all started last Thursday when user, and devout logical atheist, VeryMacabre called 911 to report an ‚Äúoffensive and totally ignorant‚Äù ichthux that was placed on Frankfusion‚Äôs car and on a shelf in their 2 bedroom apartment in the Silicon Valley.  The two users share an apartment in Cupertino as they are both trying to get into the notable Apple Inc. company. On Thursday, after a long hard day of work at the local Starbucks, VeryMacabre found that Frankfusion has installed an ichthux, a fish-resembling symbol used to denote an ignorant Christian, on the back of his 1993 Honda Civic. ‚ÄúAt first, I really wasn‚Äôt that mad, because I knew that my periodic table of elements bumper sticker on my 2011 Toyota Prius was better looking, and based on fact, but when I walked into our apartment and saw that he had put up the same little fish on our picture shelf, I just couldn‚Äôt take it,‚Äù VeryMacabre told the Weekly Sagan. Macabre immediately called 911 to report the issue and in minutes the police had arrived at the small, suburban apartment.  Frankfusion defended his case to the police by stating that ‚Äúthe ichthux was on my side of the shelf, in fact, it was in my room, I don‚Äôt even know why Macabre was in there in the first place.‚Äù  ‚ÄúI had to get your scissors to work on my art project‚Äù VeryMacabre retorted. The issue for the officers was that there was no evidence of deliberate offending and the police had to return to the station without an arrest, though without taking a full report of the incident and statements of the two individuals involved.  After a week of VeryMacabre‚Äôs argument in front of the City Council, the council ruled in favor of a new law that states that ‚Äúinvoluntary offending is, indeed, a crime.‚Äù The police have arrested Frankfusion at his local church, but as Mr. fusion stated as he was being led to the police car ‚ÄúWow, I don‚Äôt even‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt even know what the problem is‚Ä¶‚Äù  The Weekly Sagan will keep its readers updated as the story progresses.  A New Study Finds That Over 99% of Politicians Lie to Us  In a new study conducted by Harvard Law School, it has now been found that over 99% of all politicians currently in public office have lied to their constituents or to the media at one point of their elected positions. The study finds that even though both Democratic and Republican politicians have lied at the same rate, Republicans are still worse because they are ‚Äúhypocrites with no moral compass for the poor and working class of the country‚Äù. Out of the hundreds of politicians, both in the Executive and the Legislative Branch interviewed, only one was deemed ‚Äúa truth-teller‚Äù. That politician was the Congressmen from Texas (R) Ron Paul. When reached out for a statement, Congressman Paul told the Weekly Sagan, ‚ÄúI just follow the Constitution and the Founding Father in my dreams, and the truth just comes out. I really don‚Äôt try to tell the truth, it just happens naturally.‚Äù  It is important to note that, even though President Obama has, according to this study, technically lied to the people of the United States, The Weekly Sagan has endorsed him for his ‚Äúrelentless fight to make sure those slimy, greedy bastards at Walmart and Bank of America pay their fair-fucking-share.‚Äù  The Logic Tribune, The Bravery Report, and the New York Times contributed to this report.

t5_2qhos,personjones,1330469539,"I said it was an old idea, but I never said it wasn't worthwhile understanding - the reason you're being asked to look at this stuff is because it's fundamental to the field, and vital that you understand it to make sense of most more recent (and complex) ideas in the field. Yes, it's easier to come up with new ideas at the cutting edge, but you need to understand older ideas to reach it (and it's not the case that you can't never say original things about old ideas, but understanding them is more important anyway). You may think this stuff is obvious and not worth your time, but it seems that you're not entirely clear on many of the basic theoretical concepts being used here. Quite a lot of this area of linguistics, especially the philosophical side, is about thinking clearly about seemingly obvious things. This is why you need to start with original research and textbooks before tackling recent research, and this includes Iten and Recanati.  One other problem is that you seem very keen to read articles and so on, but you don't seem to be thinking about these issues for yourself in very much depth, and that's why things seem hazy - it's not enough just to read these ideas, you have to *study* them too.  Let's go back to the start and define what exactly truth conditions are - some of this may seem basic, and has probably been covered in your lectures, but bear with me. This approach has it's origin in Tarski's convention T (used for formal logic), which was applied to natural language by Davidson in 1967. The idea is that we can describe the meaning of a proposition in terms of the conditions that hold when it is true, for instance, we could say:  (1) ""Snow is white,"" if and only if snow is white.  Now, this looks like a tautology, but this is because our language of investigation (termed the object language) is the same as the language we're using to analyse it (termed the meta-language) - they're both English. So it perhaps makes more sense if we change the object language to something else like, say, German, while keeping the metalanguage the same:  (2) ""Der Schnee ist wei√ü,"" if and only if snow is white.  So now it's not longer a tautology - we're essentially saying that the German propostion ""Der Schnee ist wei√ü"" is a true statement only in worlds where the snow is white, and thus we've defined the conditions under which ""Der Schnee ist wei√ü"" is true, which we call its truth conditions.  And that's all there is to truth conditions - under this simple approach to meaning, someone who knows the meaning of a proposition is someone who knows the truth conditions under which it holds, and so is able to say whether a specific proposition is true or false in a given world. Thus we say that meaning is a function from possible worlds to truth values - i.e. it's something that, given a proposition, takes a possible world and spits out ""true,"" or ""false."" You may think this is a slightly odd way to think about meaning in any sense, and you might have a point - this is one potential problem you could investigate to criticise the truth-conditional approach. But as discussed above, even when we take truth conditions to be part of meaning, it's long been recognised that it's not the be all and end all of meaning, and the subject of pragmatics (starting with Grice) looks at meaning in a much broader sense.  You implied above that truth conditions should be represented in some kind of formal logic, and this is indeed a reasonable approach to truth-conditional semantics, because it gives us a very clear way of explaining complex propositions in terms of simpler ones, and the whole system can be set up to cope with truth values, which are the bread and butter of truth-conditional semantics. Let's consider (1) from my earlier post, repeated here as (3):  (3) I really like John, and he's very sensible.  One simple way of analysing this is to split it into two separate propositions - ""I really like John,"" which I'll call *j*, and ""he's very sensible,"" which I'll call *s*. So we can express this is normal propositional calculus as follows:  (4) j ‚àß s  So we're saying that the propositions *j* and *s* are joined with a connective (more complex analysis is of course possible, but here I'm treating *j* and *s* as ""basic"" or atomic propositions). I can see you've come across this kind of approach before, and this may (all) seem basic, but it might help you to think about what exactly ‚àß is. You've probably seen it's semantics described in terms of a truth table, but we can also think of it as a function that takes two truth values, and outputs one, with the definition of the function all being set up to coincide with the truth table (i.e. outputting true only when the two inputs are true, and false otherwise). Now, crucially, *this is all ‚àß is*. We haven't defined it in any other way in our system, so this is its meaning - something that takes the truth values of two propositions and gives you another meaning according to the inputs. As I'm sure you know, we can define other connectives similarly, such as ‚à®, ‚Üí, and ‚Üî, by changing the truth table (or the defintion of the function, if you prefer to think of it in that way).  Now, you already know that things like *but* pose a problem here, but you've proposed a possible solution - as I understand it, you're suggesting that we should define another logical connective that we can give the meaning of *but*. I suggest you try doing this - draw up the truth table that you would give *but* (which, if you recall from above, fully defines its meaning), and then compare it to the truth tables for your other logical connectives. Once you've done that, have a think about whether or not your approach works, then go back and look at (1-6) in my previous post and see if you can analyse them all using this kind of approach - remember, if you give any two propostions the same representation, then you're saying they have the same truth conditions, and if you're saying truth conditions are the same as meaning, then you're also saying they have the same meaning. If you do this correctly, you'll run into problems, and the problems you run into should help demonstrate what exactly truth conditions are, and how there can be non-truth-conditional aspects to meaning.  Then go and read Grice, or an introduction to Gricean pragmatics (crucially, not a recent paper, which will take these basic issues for granted). I think you're underestimating just how important the Gricean approach is in the study of pragmatics - in fact, some would say (along with neo-Gricean approaches) it practically *is* pragmatics. And Grice has specific analyses of cases such as *but* (they're analysed as instances of conventional implicature, a term you should come across in your reading of Grice), so implicatures are far more than just one possible exception to truth-conditional meaning.  If you want to progress in your understanding of this stuff, I suggest you take my advice and start by looking at the basics, however obvious they may seem, and thinking about them and their implications. Furthermore, have a go at the exercise I set, or at least try something comparable in a textbook. Recent research in this topic is indeed interesting, but will have to wait until you have a firm foundation to consider it from.",‚Üî

There‚Äôs nothing wrong with StarCraft if you enjoy it, and there‚Äôs nothing wrong with anything about eSports, but why would you want just one flavor of ice cream, you know? There‚Äôs eSports for people who like eSports, and there‚Äôs fighting games for people who like spicy food and like to have fun. There‚Äôs no reason to turn them into the same thing, you know?

t5_2qhh7,grapthor,1330548869,"For what it's worth, the [American Red Cross does not favor a full-on ban](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/37599992/ns/health-aids/t/ban-gay-blood-donors-upheld/) either. I think their idea of a one-year deferral is at least a step in the right direction.  But what this all comes down to is trying to secure the safety of the national blood supply, and money. Now, I'm sure we all want to be sure that the blood we're getting in a transfusion (or whatever) is 100% safe, and that means screening out blood donations containing HIV and other contaminants (antibiotics, infections, etc.).  There are two ways to do this: Either screen out individuals who are higher risk, or test the blood sample. Screening is free, blood tests are not. In fact, blood tests are, from what I understand, not exactly cheap. Sure, I can go on down the road for about a mile and find a clinic that offers free HIV testing, but that doesn't mean it's actually *free* to perform the test.  When you've got hundreds of thousands of donations, and your organization is a not-for-profit, the cost of testing certainly adds up. A sure fire way to help convince the Powers That Be‚Ñ¢ to change their policies is to bring the cost of testing down.  Now I'm not saying I'm in favor of the current for-life ban on MSM blood donations, but this is part of the rationale for the ban, an until HIV testing becomes more cost effective for large organizations like the Red Cross, it's going to be hard to get the kinds of changes we want.  Possible solution: Allow people to cover the cost of testing their own blood? I know not everyone can afford it, and not everyone would be on board with handing over good money just so you can get stabbed and leave the building dehydrated and possibly lightheaded, but depending on how much that test costs the Red Cross to have performed, I might be willing to pay it, especially in times of crisis. But that's just me.",‚Ñ¢

If you look at the history of the Third Reich you'll learn there was a lot going on that we can learn from besides the holocaust:  * We can study what occurred during the rise of the third reich and how popular opinion superseded relative morality (our country had it's own hysteria due to the 2008 financial crisis) * The stigmatization of non-aryan due to the simple concept of selling fear of ""the other"" for party support (evident by the changes to immigration laws proposed by the Conservatives, one step away from racism) * We can look at how mass media was used to maintain a dictatorship (how most of our media is controlled by right winged interests, evident by all their official endorsements being thrown behind Harper.  Also evident by the [crowd sourcing](http://xkcd.com/1019/) possible by the huge budgets the Conservative Party has) * We can look at the close ties the party had to business and industry and how that kept the party in power (all the campaign donations to the Conservatives from businesses and their unabashed opinion to keep businesses thriving despite the social consequences.  examples:  air canada back to work legislation, close ties to the oil industry, etc) * We can look at the financial situation of the German state during the rise of the nazi and communist parties and how the country's financial situation caused exodus of support for centerist parties (people were voting Conservative or NDP and the centerist Liberals' position was gutted) * The stifling of opposing views during the time Hitler was in power (which Harper does regularly by limiting debate , threatening to [sue dissenting citizens](http://www2.macleans.ca/2011/08/15/conservatives-threaten-to-sue-asbestos-widow/) and labeling groups with opposing views as extremist terrorist organizations)  If you start thinking beyond black and white you can see similarities in the history of powerful, [authoritarian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authoritarianism) regimes (The Harper Government‚Ñ¢ for example) and the history of the rise of the Third Reich.
