Essentially, the post in question objectifies this swimmer to treat him as [inspiration porn](http://www.abc.net.au/rampup/articles/2012/07/02/3537035.htm); it uses him as a tool to be used for moralizing at other able-bodied people about the power of Believing In Yourself™, while overlooking the very real obstacles that this athlete almost certainly faced, both directly from his disability and from the rampant ableism present in the world.  This is the fact of the matter: doing basically anything as a disabled person in a world not designed for us is presents obstacles (sometimes insurmountable) that do not need to be there but were put into place by an ableist society, and talking about getting past these as being the result of just believing in yourself (or similar statements) erases all of that and victim-blames the people with disabilities who do find that for them these artificial barriers are impassible.

I don't care that you don't care about necessary things.

My mom died on July 29th of this year, at just 51 years of age. (Cancer sucks.) She and I didn't have the traditional ""special"" mother/daughter relationship that everyone seems to talk about, but we had a lot in common and we loved each other very much. At first I felt nothing, her death didn't seem real until I saw her at the wake, and then I cried for days. Now, the feelings come in waves seemingly at random. Sometimes I feel nothing and go about my day like everything is normal, sometimes I fear the possibility of what happened to her happening someone else I love or even myself, sometimes I feel inspired to do things to honor her memory/utilize the gifts she gave me/make her proud, and sometimes I feel really sad and wish things were different. The only consistent thing is that I always miss her. My husband lost his father almost ten years ago, and he tells me that's pretty much what it's like, though it does get easier to bear with time.  I wish I had some magical words to make you happy... but all I can say is I'm so sorry for your loss. ♥ hugs ♥  ",♥

Trainers do things that modify the game's coding during single player and basically ""cheat"" for you.   Things include:  Invincible Units, Quick-Build, Instant Win, Reveal the Map, ETC.....  The problem is, these Trainers modify the game a little bit while you are playing ( though they are still external ). If you use one in multiplayer it causes a ""desync"" to happen where the games aren't agreeing on---For instance...Whether a Marine should be invincible or not. It then disconnects both players from the game and causes a tie. 8)  My friend had a ""Trainer"" he used for the single player campaign and tried this on me in a Custom game. It showed that exact same error: ""Desync"" and showed up as a tie.  That is likely what this person is doing---And I am sure that if you watch his APM before he loses entirely, he is alt-tabbing, loading the ""Trainer"", and telling it to do a few things to the game.   ♥  ( So it's...KINDA a ""drop hack""...But it really isn't.

Canvas curtains were erected hiding this area from sight.  Equipment moved in.  Operations commenced.  All equipment was mine-rated for electrics, EXCEPT for one small control panel.  Everything went well for about 18 months, then one night...  **BOOM**  Fortunately, no one was injured.  The two people assigned to work there just happened to be elsewhere.  One person in an adjacent room was blown off the stool he had been sitting on.  The 12' x 12' garage-type doors right beside him were blown out into the parking lot.  The entire roof of the isolated room was raised several feet, then dropped back into original position.  The fire doors leading into the main plant area were hanging askew on their hinges.  No other structural damage.  Called Fire Department, got everyone outside to account for all.  The person that had been blown off the stool was not there.

Some people thought they were making glass doorknobs.   I grew up in the same area, a few years older than she is. We always knew they were building Plutonium atom bomb cores. We talked about it in elementary school, discussed how Rocky Flats would be a target in a nuclear war and what effects it would have at our distance away.  If the book is as sensationalized as the book tour interviews, it's not worth the time to read it. ",®

t5_2qh13,hassani1387,1346674547,"Sorry I will tske the word of the UN commission on internationsl law and a ICJ judge over yours. The IAEA by the way is not authorized to demand any ""mandatory duspensions"" since the IAEA isnt even in chsrge of the NPT - which is why IAEA board members include non-NPT signatories auch as India.   But since you think googli.g a law review and then quoting back massive texr somehow proves a point:  ""Peremptory norms exist to protect the values and interests that are fundamentally important to the international community as a whole. As Judge Lauterpacht emphasized in the Bosnia case, jus cogens unconditionally binds the Security Council and this was implied also in the Tadic case. Moreover, it was very recently corroborated in the Kadi case before the Court of First Instance of European Communities, where the Court ruled that it was 'empowered to check, indirectly, the lawfulness of the resolutions of the Security Council in question with regard to jus cogens, understood as a body of higher rules of public international law binding on all subjects of international law, including the bodies of the United Nations, and from which no derogation is possible'. In line with the last ruling is also the doctrine as far as the conceptual basis of this approach is concerned: the Security Council must respect peremptory norms because the core values protected by jus cogens are not derogable or waivable in the sense of jus dipositivum. Moreover, it should be acknowledged that, as when concluding a treaty, States cannot be presumed to authorize acts contrary to jus cogens, a fortiori when they establish an international organization, they cannot avoid their operation either. This is affirmed also by the principle that States cannot delegate to it more powers than they themselves can exercise (nemo plus juris transfere quam ipse habet). Acts contra juris gestionis are beyond the powers of an institution, in casu the Security Council and therefore the provisions of the UN Charter on the latter's powers have to be interpreted and executed in a way that is compatible with peremptory norms. In addition, it is argued that not only are the Council's Resolutions part of a secondary law subjected to the Charter, but also part of a system, which in its entirety is subordinated to jus cogens. As a result, the terms of a Resolution, if vague, must be construed as requiring an outcome that is consistent with jus cogens.""

While there's definitely a tendency for Ruby developers to be more strongly focused on The Right Way™ of doing things than other groups might be, it's a universal problem. They'd say that Java is too ugly and cumbersome, and Java developers would say Ruby is too slow and hand-wavy. The real answer is simple: both have their place and should be used where appropriate.",™

I am not some noob that doesn't know what he's talking about.  &gt;Let me tell you, that god damn shit piece of work called pulseaudio does not share audio among multiple devices.  1. Yes it does. 2. That's not what I was talking about. I was talking about the exact opposite: sharing one device among multiple applications.  &gt;It does not allow you to even output your audio on one device while playing on another.  Funny you should mention that, seeing as how I've used it to do exactly that.  &gt;If its one thing that pissed me off the most about all my experiences using gnu/linux, from having to tweak irq-numbers in the early days to get my ISA soundcard to work, god damn pulseaudio fuck it to hell and all its false promises. Pulseaudio is a horrible piece of shit software with an even more horrible documen-tation to speak of. The first thing I ever do on any linux is to scan for and delete all traces of its god damn name.  Status of jimmies: ☐ not rustled ☑ rustled  &gt;Mind you, letting several applications use the soundcard at once is something ALSA does very very well, without even noticing it, it just works, all the applications can play music at the same time, its like a wonder!  Haha, what? Are you dropping acid, son? The only way you can accomplish that with only ALSA is `dmix`, you have to tweak undocumented configuration files in order to use it, it adds massive latency, and you still can't both play audio and record audio through the same device at the same time.  &gt;The reason for pulseaudio was having networked sound, something arts and esd tried to do, and they still do that better than turd.  &amp;hellip;you're hallucinating. That's the only conclusion I can draw from this nonsensical diatribe. Seek professional help; you clearly need it.",☑

The miVape™ is the size of a smart phone, and it's glass airway results in the most pure vapor in the industry! After nearly 12 months of design development, the miVape™ is in our final engineering and testing stage. The miVape™ will be the first truly pocket portable vaporizer, made with medical-grade materials throughout. The glass mouthpiece can be replaced if broken, it will boast a rechargeable battery which will last for approximately 3-4 hours and can be used while charging or with the optional car adapter, it has an adjustable temperature range of +/- 300 to 400 F with the control located under the flip top (temperature is reached in less than a minute), it's outer perimeter dimensions are about the size of a 1.25"" thick iPhone. The front and back of the unit is heat resistant glass like acrylic with a metal band around. We expect to begin deliveries in late December.*  Another [pic](http://i.imgur.com/kbLh7.jpg)",™

The word 'LEGO', when used as a noun, should only refer to the company that makes the product. Otherwise 'LEGO' is supposed to be used as an adjective. Thus, when referring to the pieces, neither 'lego' nor 'legos' is correct... rather one should say: 'LEGO bricks' or 'LEGO pieces' or whatever (using LEGO as an adjective -- and one should really capitalize all of the letters, and put the little 'circle-R' symbol after it (®)).

As for the ""for every device ever"" part, that's a fragile hack and I saw that from the start.  It could never last.  Relative layouts are so much more versatile and are the right way to handle layouts for variable screen sizes (see: auto-layout).  Static layouts, even now, suck ass because if I put a view in a view controller then add a tab or tool bar later on then I have to redo all the elements if I didn't set the auto-sizing controls correctly (which is something you didn't touch but already handles some of this for us). I'm sure auto-layouts are being added for exactly this sort of thing and I'm glad; springs and struts are sooo NeXTStep.

t5_2tdoc,MsPrynne,1346731344,"I think that to some degree rules like this exist just to get you accustomed to a.) following rules (because you haven't had enough of those yet) and b.) behaving in a Professional And Businesslike Way™. Not saying that that's good or bad, it's just kind of the way it is.   That said, any administration worth their credentials is going to be receptive (or at least not hostile) if you want to voice your concerns about this issue in a thoughtful and reasonable way, so if that sounds interesting to you, might as well give it a shot, right?  There's strength in numbers, so I would see if you can get a few like-minded individuals together. If you can't find anyone, maybe you could run an opinion piece about the dress code in your school paper, or talk to some of your student government officers.  Once you have some people together, work as a team to figure out:    * which rules you find the most bothersome/restrictive/unfair    *  why you find them unfair (student rights, individuality, students being unable to afford new clothes that conform to the dress code, etc.)    * what changes could be made to the unfair rules to make them more reasonable (complaints are FAR more effective when they are accompanied by a suggestion for improvement...for instance, ""we think the rule about piercings should be changed to allow students to wear skin-toned or clear jewelry to keep their piercings open, since nude piercings are barely visible and unlikely to cause a distraction,"" not just ""we don't like the rule about piercings."")    After you've got all that sorted, you may want to see if one of the cool teachers is willing to let you practice on him or her and give you some pointers, and then it's time to make an appointment with an administrator to go over your points.   It'll be totally rad!  ",™

t5_2cneq,TiberiCorneli,1346766689,"The Southern strategy was a Republican plan back in the 1960s.  Prior to this the South was pretty strongly Democratic. Way back when the Democrats had supported slavery, and even after the Civil War the Southern Democrats still tended to be some racist dickrags. They also tended to be from the more conservative wing of the party. Back in 1948 some of them formed a new party, called the States Rights Democratic Party (popularly known as Dixiecrats), but it fizzled out after the election of '48.  But then in the mid-1960s you had the whole civil rights movement. Things like the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, incidents like James Meredith trying to register at Ole Miss, everything that went on. Southern Democrats, by and large, did not approve of such things. In fact, on passing either the CRA or VRA (I believe the former), Johnson famously said ""We have the lost the South for a generation.""  Nixon wasn't the only one to go in looking to win the South out from under the Democrats, but he's certainly the most famous, having used it to win the Presidency. Ultimately all he had to do was pander.  Nixon correctly recognized that, by and large, white southerners were not going to vote for the guy who was looking to abolish Jim Crow. He knew that these people were strong advocates of ""states' rights"". He also knew that, especially amongst the elderly, the hippie counterculture and the large numbers of young people engaging in it were not popular, so he set about decrying the moral degradation of today's youth. (And in 1969 he would sort-of do it again, making famous the phrase ""silent majority"")  TL;DR Democrats passed civil rights legislation which pissed off white southerners, Republicans behaved like Rick Santorum while campaigning in the South in order to sway the Angry White Voter™.",™

t5_2qhk3,ExpendableOne,1346768572,"That depends how how you define ""acting like they are always under the treat of rape"" and ""protective clothing"".  Technically, this is something that most men already do, as most men will dress themselves, and act, as though they are always under the *possible* threat of violence, whether sexual and non-sexual(something which I would also argue men are at a much higher risk of, and often pose a greater risk for far more serious and/or permanent physical/psychological harm).  There are reasons why men wear attire that they would normally feel comfortable defending themselves in or attire that makes them look somewhat imposing or threatening(generally they are exposed to that, even from a very young age, and are given very few recourse, attention or care compared to women).  These actions and precautions might not always be as noticeable or even subconscious but they are still there; and they are still possible without those men being hysterical about the risks of female attention, sexual assault, theft or assault. There are certainly basic/common sense precautions that women could can also follow, most of which have already been stated countless times before, that also wouldn't impair their person's quality of life or that wouldn't necessitate them to vilify or demonize the entire male gender.   &gt;How does you advice work for rape victims that are children and the majority of rapes that don't involve physical force?  Rapes that do not involve physical force? You'll have to be more specific here.  I would argue that rape is, by definition, an act that requires force or threat of physical harm. That is what rape is; whether you know the person or not.  Without forcing the victim to endure the sexual act through force or direct physical threat(like, a knife for example), it isn't rape. Stretching the definition of the word to bring more severity to other forms of sexual misconduct only diminishes the significance of the word.   If you're referring to cases where women stated ""yes"", verbally or non-verbally, and then recanted that consent after the fact, or cases where women agreed to have sex and then felt remorse/guilt about it afterwards? That is not rape, that is someone making a poor decision or not being willing to take responsibility for their own actions and/or mistakes.  It's a pretty disgusting double-standard that this feminist redefinition of rape™ is even as entertained as it is, simply because it benefits women.    If you're referring to cases where women find themselves impaired, or completely unable to defend themselves because of drugs/alcohol and then sexually taken advantage of, than that is sexual misconduct or sexual abuse.  The only advice or precaution that I could give, just as I would also give to any men(though, again, most men also already seem to understand this already) is do not put yourself in a state where you cannot defend yourself.  Do not abuse alcohol or drugs when you are with people you do not trust, if even at all. It is just as easy for men to be taken advantage of(physically, sexually, financially or even socially) in these situations, and it should really be avoided altogether.  The fact that women can even hold everyone else around them responsible for their own sobriety, while men held to different standards altogether, is in of itself a pretty disturbing double-standard.   If you are referring to statuary rape(and by that, I mean people clearly taking advantage of minors, not a sixteen year old that ends up having sex with a fifteen year old) where no physical force is ever used, however, that also isn't rape; it is is severe sexual misconduct, sexual abuse, negligence, and it is taking advantage, and harming, a child; all of which should be punished by law for both men and women equally.  The obvious advice here is proper supervision and teaching kids basic safety measures(which I believe they already do and that children follow, which only speaks to how absurd it is for women to feel as though they shouldn't have to be bothered by such safety precautions).

[Mary Magdalene: The Hidden Apostle](http://store.aetv.com/html/catalog/vp01.jhtml?id=17903)     “The first person to whom Jesus appeared after his resurrection has been the victim of a 2,000-year smear campaign. This groundbreaking profile strives to set the record straight.”          “Mary Magdalene was not a prostitute. Rather, she, was a woman of wealth whose financial support was crucial to the early survival of Christianity. But, as BIOGRAPHY® reveals, the special relationship she had with Christ led to resentment among the other disciples, and her reputation was tarnished as a result. Drawing on ancient texts, rare art and the research of top scholars at Harvard, Yale, Catholic University and the University of Wisconsin, this far-reaching portrait compares the evidence we have with the stories we have heard--and tries to reconcile them.”          “She was a disciple who believed in the word of the Lord long before many others, yet her reward was to be misrepresented for millennia!",®

t5_2qh2p,aerojh,1346788320,"I really don't know enough about the mathematics behind 3D rendering, so I'll do a high level overview of genetic algorithms and let you decide.  Genetic algorithms are most commonly used to solve optimization problems. For example, suppose we want to maximize karma and minimize effort.  To do this, we'll look at a _population_ of karma generators, consisting of _individuals_. There are a lot of ways to represent these individuals (also known as _chromosomes_), which are composed of _genes_. So, a chromosome can encode multiple genes. In our case let's look at three: type of post, subreddit, and time of day. We need to come up with a way to encode these genes numerically. There are a lot of ways, but the most common are binary strings and arrays/vectors. So, a binary string might be something likes 11010101, where the first two bits encode the content type, the next four the subreddit, and the last two the time. (I'm just making these up for our example Karma Optimizer™.) The same data might be encoded as the vector [3, 5, 1] (assuming my mental binary to decimal conversion is correct--left as an exercise to the reader).  Now that we have a representation, we randomly generate a large population of chromosomes. As everyone on /r/atheism should know, [natural selection, that is the key](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxDOpAM2FrQ). Thus, it should be clear that we need a way to determine the _fitness_ of each individual. This is a user-defined function that maps each chromosome to a scalar-valued fitness. In our case we might use the estimated karma as a fitness, generated through some sort of mathematical model. So, for example, a Richard Dawkins quotation posted to /r/atheism during peak reddit hours would have a much higher fitness than the same quote posted to /r/TrueChristian. Creating a fitness function is arguably an art.  So, we calculate the fitness of each individual in our population and then rank the hypotheses (yet another name for an individual) from best to worst. The top hypotheses are called _elites_ and get to join the next generation of the population. From the remaining elements of the current population, a probability function is used to pick groups of two hypotheses for an operation called _crossover_. A crossover function combines bits of the two parents to produce two children (sexual reproduction). After this a stochastic _mutation_ operator is applied to add some randomness to the population (think of errors when DNA is copied). Once this is done, there is a new population consisting of the elite children and the children of the crossed-over parents.  This process is repeated until the fitness of the best individual meets whatever requirement you set. In our karma-crazed example, this might be becoming a reddit legend.  Hope that helps.  **Sources:**  1. Mitchell, T. M., _Machine Learning_, The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc., Boston, MA, 1997, pp. 249–273. 2. Russell, S.

Yes, the LL feels harassed, but they can still say no.  &gt; This can be shortened to ""fifty no's and one yes is not a yes"". Or ""fifty no's and a silence is not a yes"".  I would disagree with you on the former and totally agree with you on the latter saying.  The focus in the former is on the wording, with the last granting consent. (I think the idea that the former is trying to convey is that saying 'yes' while meaning 'no' is not consent.) I think that if the person has the power to say 'no' the fifty-first time, and is not under active duress, or constraint, or 'Implication' then the 'yes' is valid consent.   I don't view any rational person viewing fifty 'noes' followed by silence as consent. That seems rather open and shut to me.  One thing that seems to be crucial to the meaning of, but unspoken, in your phrases, is the rate of requesting sex. (Bring on the strawman examples!) Fifty noes over a year? That's rape?

t5_2qh3p,MCEnergy,1346869851,"Hey Scruff13,  There are a few things you can do to make yourself into a good Dom. We'll focus on this since Subs require very different qualities.  1) *Create a contract. *  A contract is an agreement that sets limits, boundaries, roles, and responsibilities. You don't have to write one out, but it should be clear and all-encompassing. Here's a link to figuring out which questions matter to you, the Dom. [http://bit.ly/OkLifQ](http://bit.ly/OkLifQ).  2) *Practice What You Preach*  It is absolutely fundamental that you are **consistent**. If you do not create trust, and keeping your word and acting predictably is crucial, then your sub will not respect your Word.   3) *Kill the Ego, Man*  Being a Dom can be difficult because you assert so much control over ""scenes"" (sex-related D/S) that it can leak over into social life. Your Sub may enjoy being called slave in the bedroom, but in front of their friends, it can create problems for him/her. So, establish key words that *begin* scenes, and key words that *end* scenes.   4) *Build It Up*  Your Sub should thrive on anticipation and release, the driving factors to a good domination. The more that you establish atmosphere and authority, the more that your sub will acknowledge your Presence. Clear speech, automatic punishments, and pure attention and acknowledgment increase dominance. Sloppiness, forgetfulness, or even the briefness of a scene can lead to the sub feeling confused, disillusioned, put off. So, plan your scenes! And ask your sub tons of questions. You can do that.   5) *Make Them Cum*  Scenes can be all well and good, but sometimes they just don't cut it, when it comes to sexual pleasure. Your sub deserves rewards. How much anticipation they must endure, and how many hoops that they have to jump through to receive their reward is simply a factor of your strictness.   6) *Make Up and Debrief* Dom/subbing takes a lot out of you. Physically, psychologically, and emotionally, it bears a tax. Make sure that you have a conversation with your sub about what each of you experienced. It is important that both partners discuss their high/low points and perhaps explain inconsistencies in behaviour.  Types of Disclipline:  *Humiliation* Transgression – Stand in corner, in public Sub sleeps at edge of bed, or outside, etc. Repeat a phrase, “I'm a naughty, little sub,” etc.  *Physical Domination* Domme sleeps with sex in subs mouth. Must wake up to the same thing. Domme leads sub around the house, with hand on shoulder, neck, head, etc. Domme directs sub's body position and how long (s)he is to hold it. Bondage play. Instruct him/her that (s)he is never to touch your body without permission.  *Verbal Domination* Nickname of demeaning status. May not speak unless ________. Can only request to speak, does not have the right to. May not moan during sexual pleasure  Types of Reward: Emotional 	Flower; nice message in the morning; activity, task, or chore; help, etc.  Physical 	massage; caressing; bath, etc. Sexual 	Choice of activity, position, or period of time. 	Choice of where Domme cums. 	Choice of place, or of which boundary to push.  Last but not least, is the sub's rights. Make sure that (s)he reads this aloud, to you. I feel that that establishes a true understanding of respectable boundaries for the sub.  *Rights of the sub* ""I have the right to set limits, and expect them to be respected. I have the right to adjust these limits at any time, with notice to you. I have the right to expect you to push them, to force me to create new limits and boundaries.  I have the right to privacy. I expect you to be concerned about time we spend apart, but I expect you to understand that I am a person, separate from you, and thusly having problems and situations in my life that I will not need your help with. I have the right to expect you will respect me for my independence and not criticize me for it. I have the right to ask you for help, should I need it. I have the right to be trusted, providing I have earned it, and I have the right to expect you to believe I am an intelligent, caring and loyal person.  I have the right to ask things of you, and have you listen to my requests. I have the right to ask for your attention, without having to misbehave to get it. I have the right to ask you to contribute as much to this relationship as I do. As long as my requests are submitted respectfully, I expect you to consider them as you would from any friend or colleague. I have the right to question your motives, should you deny my requests, as long as I do so with the proper respect.  I have the right to expect you to administer punishment with care and caution. I have the right to use my safewords at any point, should I feel them necessary. I have the right to get up and walk away from a scene if you have crossed the line. I have the right to expect you to respect my decisions, and not think less of me, or abandon me for them.  I have the right to speak up if I feel our relationship is not giving me what I need. I have the right to tell you what I need, in a respectful manner. I have the right to expect you to understand my reasons for doing so, and the right to expect you to listen with an open mind. I have the right to walk away from the relationship if we cannot come to a common ground on these issues.  I have the right to expect tenderness, love and understanding after a scene is completed, should it be what I desire. I have the right to ask you for that tenderness if I've had a bad day, or if I just feel the need for closeness. I understand that there will be times when you and I will disagree about this -- when you will want a scene, and I will not. I have the right to call for a talk about this, and to expect you to listen to and consider my reasonings. I expect you to have the final word, but I expect you to wholeheartedly consider my feelings, whatever they may happen to be.  I have the right to expect our relationship to progress, for trust to continually be renewed, for our souls to be as close as our bodies are. I have the right to tell you if I need more from you, and I expect you to respect my decisions about what I want and need. I expect you to want the relationship to progress, unless decided otherwise beforehand. I expect you to understand that deep trust often breeds love, and I expect you not to repel me if I tell you that I love you. For I will love you, my master, should our relationship move ahead, should our trust continue to grow.  I have the right to expect you to tell me, at any point, if you do not feel you can return those feelings, so that I may decide what I want and need. For it is your pleasure that adds to my own, makes it real. And mine, that adds to yours.""

Here ya go, check out this scripture about vengeance.:   Romans 12:19 New Living Translation (©2007) Dear friends, never take revenge. Leave that to the righteous anger of God. For the Scriptures say, ""I will take revenge; I will pay them back,"" says the LORD.

t5_2s3yz,stoonedjesus,1346878139,"&gt;Female (♀) is the sex of an organism, or a part of an organism, which produces non-mobile ova (egg cells).  &gt;Defining characteristics The ova are defined as the larger gametes in a heterogamous reproduction system, while the smaller, usually motile gamete, the spermatozoon, is produced by the male. A female individual cannot reproduce sexually without access to the gametes of a male (an exception is parthenogenesis). Some organisms can reproduce both sexually and asexually. There is no single genetic mechanism behind sex differences in different species and the existence of two sexes seems to have evolved multiple times independently in different evolutionary lineages[citation needed]. Patterns of sexual reproduction include isogamous species with two or more mating types with gametes of identical form and behavior (but different at the molecular level), anisogamous species with gametes of male and female types, oogamous species in which the female gamete is very much larger than the male and has no ability to move. There is an argument that this pattern was driven by the physical constraints on the mechanisms by which two gametes get together as required for sexual reproduction.[1] Other than the defining difference in the type of gamete produced, differences between males and females in one lineage cannot always be predicted by differences in another. The concept is not limited to animals; egg cells are produced by chytrids, diatoms, water moulds and land plants, among others. In land plants, female and male designate not only the egg- and sperm-producing organisms and structures, but also the structures of the sporophytes that give rise to male and female plants.",♀

All a ""Desync"" means is that the two games are disagreeing on the values being used in the game for say---Whether or not units instant build from a Barracks ( Which we both know they don't. ). These values can be anything from revealing the entire map, to ""invincible units"", to infinite minerals/gas, etc ( I think you get the point. ).  The ""Single Player Trainer"" is a program that does this for the campaign. It's a third-party program that enables these things in the campaign of the game and allows people to breeze through it, hunt portraits/achievements, whatever they want....By cheating further than Blizzard would allow you to. It causes the values of certain game elements to change.  When you use this program in a multiplayer setting, you are modifying your files/values for the game.   So the following essentially happens:  My game, without the ""trainer"", tells you that my Zerglings have a certain amount of health. You attack me, I am losing, I'm this sore-loser piece of crap....And suddenly alt-tab and turn the ""Trainer"" on. Suddenly my game is now trying to tell your game that my Zerglings never die. Your game stops, analyzes this...And says..""What? That's not right."". It tries to communicate with mine further, and the two games cannot reach an agreement ( the ""desync"" ). The game disconnects us both, because Blizzard originally assumes that these ""Desync"" errors are connection/battle.net/program errors on their part and doesn't want either player to get hurt as a result of this....So it ends in a tie.

While there are other games out there with no difficulty settings, I'm not quite sure how to say it... the feeling of shared experience seems to have extra value with Souls games. If you split the community with another difficulty mode, I think some of that feeling of kinship will be lost.  If I touch a bloodstain at the bottom of catacombs and it shows a guy running along, then suddenly standing in place and having a seizure, my heart goes out to him. I feel the bonewheel grinding against me, too. I really value that sort of brotherhood in misery.

I don't know the details of how a Souls game easy mode would be implemented, but it's also entirely possible that you'd never (or rarely) have to interact with casual players. Opening the game up to a wider audience might even expand the hardcore community as casual players graduate to the higher default difficulty.  &gt; ...but it does make a difference to me that someone is getting it in the butt from Dark Souls™ and not Dark Souls-like game product™.""

You're able to acknowledge that you want to quit PMO so that's an very good first step. Next you need to make a mental or physical list of why, and what you hope to accomplish.

Now whenever I get that temptation, and believe me we all do, I can review that list and remember that there are real reasons I'm doing it.   As for getting started, I suggest blocking all your favorite porn sites by adding lines like these to your hosts file on your computer:      127.0.0.1 xtube.com www.xtube.com     127.0.0.1 random-porn-site.com www.random-porn.site.com  And so on, for all the trigger sites you visit.

As far as possible without surrender be on good terms with all              persons.       Speak your truth quietly and clearly; and listen to others, even              the dull and ignorant; they too have their story.       Avoid loud and aggressive persons, they are vexations to the              spirit.       If you compare yourself with others, you may become vain and              bitter;       for always there will be greater and lesser persons than              yourself.              Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans.       Keep interested in your career, however humble; it is a real              possession in the changing fortunes of time.       Exercise caution in your business affairs; for the world is full of              trickery.       But let this not blind you to what virtue there is; many persons              strive for high ideals;       and everywhere life is full of heroism.        Be yourself.       Especially, do not feign affection.       Neither be critical about love; for in the face of all aridity and              disenchantment it is as perennial as the grass.        Take kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering the              things of youth.       Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune. But              do not distress yourself with imaginings.       Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness. Beyond a              wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself.        You are a child of the universe, no less than the trees and the              stars;       you have a right to be here.       And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is              unfolding as it should.              Therefore be at peace with God, whatever you conceive Him to              be,       and whatever your labors and aspirations, in the noisy              confusion of life keep peace with your soul.       With all its sham, drudgery and broken dreams, it is still a              beautiful world. Be cheerful. Strive to be happy.              © Max Ehrmann 1927",©

t5_2r0gj,kingofharts,1346953190,"Joseph Smith never had relations with Fanny eh bishop?? Here's some info from that book you supposedly read..  Alger was fourteen when her family joined the Church in Mayfield, near Kirtland, in 1830. In 1836, after a time as a serving girl in the Smith household, she left Kirtland and soon married. Between those two dates, perhaps as early as 1831, she and Joseph were reportedly involved, but conflicting accounts make it difficult to establish the facts— much less to understand Joseph’s thoughts. Was he a blackguard covering his lusts with religious pretensions, or a prophet doggedly adhering to instructions from heaven, or something in between?  ....  The Far West court did not accuse Joseph of being involved with Alger. Some councilors had heard the rumors, but concluded they were untrue. They were concerned only with Cowdery’s insinuations. He was on trial for false accusations, not Joseph for adultery. David Patten, an apostle, “went to Oliver Cowdery to enquire of him if a certain story was true respecting J. Smith’s committing adultery with a certain girl, when he turned on his heel and insinuated as though he was guilty.” Thomas Marsh, another apostle, reported a similar experience. “Oliver Cowdery cocked up his eye very knowingly and hesitated to answer the question, saying he did not know as he was bound to answer the question yet conveyed the idea that it was true.” George Harris testified that in conversation between Cowdery and Joseph the previous November, Cowdery “seemed to insinuate that Joseph Smith jr was guilty of adultery.” Eventually the court concluded that Cowdery had made false accusations, and cut him off from the Church. 7 Cowdery denied that he had lied about Joseph and Alger. Cowdery had heard the accusations against him when he wrote to Joseph in January 1838. “I learn from Kirtland, by the last letters, that you have publickly said, that when you were here I confessed to you that I had willfully lied about you.” He demanded that Joseph retract the statement. In a letter to his brother Warren, Cowdery insisted he would never dishonor the family name by lying about anything, much less about the Smiths, whom he had always defended. In his conversations with Joseph, Cowdery asserted, “in every instance, I did not fail to affirm that what I had said was strictly true,” meaning he believed Joseph did have an affair. His insinuations were not lies but the truth as he understood it.  ...  These scraps of testimony recorded within a few years of the Alger business show how differently the various parties understood events. In the contemporaneous documents, only one person, Cowdery, believed that Joseph had had an affair with Fanny Alger. Others may have heard the rumors, but none joined Cowdery in making accusations. 11 David Patten, who made inquiries in Kirtland, concluded the rumors were untrue. No one proposed to put Joseph on trial for adultery. Only Cowdery, who was leaving the Church, asserted Joseph’s involvement. On his part, Joseph never denied a relationship with Alger, but insisted it was not adulterous. He wanted it on record that he had never confessed to such a sin. Presumably, he felt innocent because he had married Alger.  **TL;DR - Oliver Cowdery accused Joseph Smith of being an adulterer (with Fanny Alger), and his allegations resulted in excommunication. Joseph Smith never denied having sexual relations with Fanny, he simply denied that that they were ""adulterous"", and actually felt innocent because these relations were, he felt, under a genuine, sanctified marriage. If your bishop denies Joseph Smith having relations with 14 year old girls (somewhere around this young age), and he actually read Rough Stone Rolling, he obviously wasn't reading hard enough. What a joke.**   Bushman, Richard Lyman. Joseph Smith : Rough Stone Rolling. Westminster, MD, USA: Alfred A.

t5_2rosz,ucemike,1346963122,"&gt; Hello Norrath!  There aren't many people that say that they have been involved in a project as highly acclaimed as EverQuest. Fortunately, I am one of those few people that can. Now, in my fourth year with the team, I have the distinct pleasure to announce the latest expansion for EverQuest: Rain of Fear™  EverQuest celebrates an unprecedented 20th major game release with the Rain of Fear™ Expansion. Thirteen years after the initial launch of EverQuest and 19 expansions later, Rain of Fear™ continues an exciting storyline that started two years ago with the mysterious House of Thule™ Expansion, and continued in Veil of Alaris™.  You and your friends destroyed the newly created god, The Triumverate, causing an explosion that rocked Norrath and released the stolen power of fear. This power is returning to Norrath, falling from the sky in the form of crystalline shards. Who will gain control of the essence of fear and bring balance between good and evil?  The Harbingers of Thule entreat you to gather the essence of their lost god before it falls into the hands of others. You will uncover the mysteries of the giant crystals that have fallen to Norrath, explore newly discovered lands, revisit the frozen wastes of Velious, and battle old foes empowered by shards, confront them and reclaim the power of fear.  Along the way you will progress up to the unprecedented level of 100! We're pretty excited to see the first character reach level 100 in EverQuest, a true gaming landmark.  We will also be adding a few amazing features to this classic game. We will be adding a way to track your relative aggro level. Ever wanted to know when the bad guy was about to turn around and mash your rogue before it happened? With the new aggro meter if you get caught over-aggroing, you'll have no real excuse. There are also new Collection and Hunter Tasks; these will allow you to gather up various items all over Norrath as well as track your kills to gain new titles and new rewards. Want to become the Gnollslayer? Gnomeslayer? Now you can. We will also be making some major improvements to the brokering system. The Autonomous Brokering system (name may change if people continue to have issues pronouncing it...) is something that you have asked us for, something that we've wanted to make for you, for years. You will be able to turn off your computer and keep your trader up in Bazaar!  This is an exciting expansion for the EverQuest team, we hope it will be just as exciting for our customers as well. Thanks for playing EverQuest!  T -Thom Terrazas aka, Phathom On behalf of the EverQuest &amp; SOE Team",™

The bottom of his website states ""© 2012 {ALOMEDIA} ~ WEBSITE BY ALOMEDIA.NET"". Alomedia is supposedly a web design company, but only lists three clients: 1) a site called 'ULUCKYGIRL', which states that it was in fact developed by a different company - Ideal Growth, 2) His site davidseamanforcongress.com, and finally 3) Deepellumonair.com, a texas based radio station which advertises itself as '100%' local.  So here's a few things:  * His biography at http://alomedia.net/portfolio/david-seaman-for-congress/ states that you have ""been a guest on CNN Headline News, FOX News, ABC News Digital"", yet I can't seem to find these appearances online, or any mention of them on his site.  * Why has Deepellumonair.com, a supposedly 100% local Texas radio station, has been so interested in promoting a Congressional candidate for FL-20?  * His twitter account constantly discusses donations  Combined with the comments above, my general impression is that nothing about this guy is genuine.  So here's my guess: David Seaman is a 26 year old who used to work in online media who is now using internet freedom as a platform to drive donations for a campaign he doesn't really intend to win.

It's a crazy amount of money for a child's shoe, but if you're in a really cold climate you can't beat them for keeping little tootsies warm. I'm the oldest of three, and while my mom was not a fan of secondhand shoes, the boots did get passed down through all of us so they were worth the money in the end.

Also, because you can loosen the laces, you might have more room to work with where the leg meets the foot.

t5_2qh1i,depleater,1346987108,"&gt; Let me be clear here: SRS dismissively labels a lot of things as &gt; ""biotruths."" And what they label often does happen to be full of shit.  Agreed.  &gt; But SRS has also applied the same label to disputable but &gt; nonetheless valid claims, such as evolutionary psychology or &gt; hardwired differences between the sexes, which indicates that the &gt; criterion for a ""biotruth"" is not pseudoscience but in fact merely a &gt; claim with which SRS doesn't agree.  What I remember about use of the term “biotruth” (mainly though not entirely in SRS) is that it doesn't necessarily mean that *every* component of the accused-as-biotruthy claim being made is baseless/unproven - it can be that the overall claim makes a reference to some perfectly valid scientific point, but then makes a chain of dicey-at-best conclusions *from* that point that leads to Biotruth™ (because the final conclusion is one that somehow just happens to justify a racist/sexist/etc. point of view).  And while I don't think it's worth you making the effort to dig out specific examples of the sort of “disputable but nonetheless valid claims” you consider were unjustly labelled as biotruth (really - I'm *not* implying you're lazy or suggesting that those examples don't actually exist), I suspect there's an extremely strong chance that they'd fall into that category.  (Note: But if you feel particularly enthusiastic to dig up some examples, I don't mind at all - I love being proved wrong. :-))  &gt; Also, everybody here already knows what pseudoscience is. Seriously?  &lt;shrug&gt; Hell, I “know” what it is, but I also like to refresh my understanding - and I like it when posters provide relevant links so I can quickly/easily double-check the meaning of a term, so I try to do it as well.

t5_2r2o9,angrybiologist,1347011749,"Additionally, at that point in time, House Stark is on the verge of extinction. We're not told of any extended Stark family, and, presumably, Brandon and Lyanna died childless. Only Ned and Benjen are left to rebuild their house.   It seems weird to me that Benjen would leave it all up to Ned to rebuild the Stark line (Ned could still be seen as a rebel lord after all these years as Robert claims *there are some people who still call [him] usurper* so there is still a little danger there that the Stark house could perish). I don't know if at that time Robb is already born, but that shouldn't have been enough reason for Benjen to take the Black so young--I think it more reasonable for Benjen to go on as bannerman for a time, until he had sons that could be his heir, then take the Black.   Also we see there are several reasons why men join the NW: duty (Mormont, Royce?), punishment (thieves and rapers), coercion (Thorne, Tarly, Royce?), outgrown usefulness (Noyle, Gendry?), safety (Targaryen, Gendry?). I don't think Benjen went under punishment/coercion/outgrown usefulness, and I think he's too young for duty (because he seems to regret it as he tries to persuade Jon to reconsider what he's asking), that leaves safety as a possible reason (to avoid being used for the secret of R♥L=J).

t5_2qm7u,dtardif,1347031040,"&gt; It's like trying to convince someone that a food they find disgusting is actually quite delicious. It's a personal preference and has nothing to do with being closed minded.  If someone doesn't like a food, they just don't eat it.  If someone thinks they have the ""correct"" tastes in food, they tell you that what you're eating is actually not good food even though you think it is.  That's the salient difference.  The second person thinks his opinion is The Correct Opinion™.  &gt; Now if my friend told me he thought baseball was boring and asked what I saw in it, I'd be happy to talk with them about it.  If someone said ""I find baseball boring, can you explain what you like about it"", I obviously would not find that closed minded - they are directly asking for your explanation and input.  Who in their right mind would think that's closed minded?  The phrasing itself is asking for an explanation, and that phrasing was not described or implied by the OP.  I think we all accepted that the case was that the person was dismissing baseball as ""boring"", which *is* closed minded.",™

Edit: ~~Applying the True Christian Scale Factor™ of 0.0001% to /r/Christianity tells me that there are 4 True Christians™ who subscribe to that subreddit. Since /u/LouIchthys is banned, they must be /u/CptQuestionMark, /u/lajaw, /u/VoltageKnight, and /u/mccreac123. Sorry /u/arizonaiced1, you apparently didn't make the cut.~~  Edit 2:  How embarrassing. I did my math wrong for how many True Christians™ are subscribed to /r/Christianity. I scaled by 0.01% instead of 0.0001%. I was off by a *huge* amount. There's actually only **0.04239** True Christians, or 4.239% of one True Christian™. This is probably due to the fact that some of Lou's old comments and posts are still there despite the fact that he's banned. I am so sorry to have let you all down with my terrible math skills.  TL;DR LouIchthys is mathematically proven to be correct; there are no True Christians™ in /r/Christianity.",™

I'm an intermediate guitar player but I have and ear 😓. Good luck and practice a lot! Also, you can try signing with your guitar and looking up stuff on the Internet. The interment is a great source for everything. Also, you can try tuning you guitar without a tuner to help develope your ear, but have a tuner in handy (if you have an iPhone or something you can get an app for this). Learn how to tune strings using other strings, and check with the tuner to see how well you did. After that you fix it. Guitar strings will go out of tune every now and then do you'll get lots of chances to practice. You will get even more practice if you change tunings a lot, although it is a pain. ",😓

t5_2qqjc,Mr_B0X,1347163367,"This friends of reddit is the VASIMR® VX-200, a plasma rocket prototype that will change the future of space travel forever.  Small explanation: The plasma rocket does not provide much thrust but rather uses small plasma bursts in frictionless space to continually add force to the traveling object, increasing the speed with every burst to never before reached speeds, making interstellar travel possible!  The VASIMR® engine works with plasma, a very hot gas, at temperatures close to the interior of the Sun. Plasmas are electrically charged fluids that can be heated to extreme temperatures by radio waves and controlled and guided by strong magnetic fields. The magnetic field also insulates any nearby structure, so temperatures well beyond the melting point of materials can be achieved and the resulting plasma can be harnessed to produce propulsion. In rocket propulsion, the higher the temperature of the exhaust gases, the higher their velocity and hence the higher their fuel efficiency. Plasma rockets feature exhaust velocities far above those achievable by their chemical cousins, so their fuel consumption is extremely low and their fuel-related costs substantially reduced.",®

The Pet Fund http://www.thepetfund.com/ ALL applicants are REQUIRED to contact The Pet Fund by phone BEFORE applying for funding. Call 916-443-6007. This way, we can ensure that all applicants are aware of both the current wait list time and the eligibility requirements for applying for financial assistance. The Pet Fund receives up to 200 calls per day, and it may take our volunteer staff some time to respond to each call and email request. Applications which are sent in before applicants have spoken with our staff will not be processed.  www.angels4animals.org/ Program Guardian Angel This is where Program Guardian Angel comes in. Working together with the clinic, we verify that the pet owner is unable to provide the funds needed to save their sick or injured pet. We then work out the financial arrangements with the clinic and authorize the treatment needed to save the pet.

t5_2qh13,cloutthegame,1347216184,"You're wrong about addiction, first off.  Cigarettes are the most addictive, but that's for social reasons.  Crack cocaine and other similarly short-acting drugs are far more addictive than heroin.  What you're also not understanding is that in most official statistics, your cause of death is marked as ""heroin"" if you die from any blood-borne disease and have ever used heroin.  Even if you didn't ever use it IV or contract the disease that way, your COD is ""heroin"".  Luckily, I did find some more specific statistics.  They still have the problem of over-implicating opiates in multiple drug overdoses because they only use the ""first-listed"" drug in multiple drug ODs as the ""drug of fault"", but it avoids some of the other common problems:  http://www.hhs.gov/asl/testify/2008/03/t20080312b.html  ""With the latest, 2005 death data, we were able to drill down even further and look at the specific drugs causing the deaths.  For deaths with multiple drugs involved, we looked at only the first-listed drug, which is a method to assign responsibility when multiple drugs are involved. This analysis showed that opioid painkillers were still the most commonly found drugs, accounting for 38.2% of the first-listed drugs, with methadone by itself contributing to almost half of these deaths. Benzodiazepine sedatives such as Valium® and antidepressants accounted for 6.5%. Even without including the category of “other specified drugs,” which are mostly prescription, the total of prescription opioids, benzodiazepines, and antidepressants (about 45%), exceeds the total of cocaine, heroin, and methamphetamines/amphetamines (about 39%).""  You'll also notice that multiple drug ODs vastly outnumber single drug ODs by reading further into the document.  You'll also notice that Methadone is responsible for far more deaths than Heroin.  And as I've said before, everything is dangerous under certain conditions.  It's a non-sequitur.  You can kill yourself with water or oxygen.",®

t5_2qhk2,IanRankin,1347254149,"Microsoft only has *wired* controller support for the Xbox 360.   That being said, what you're looking for is [Xbox Controller Driver](http://www.redcl0ud.com/xbcd.html) or (XBCD). This would allow you to use any USB-compatible controllers and emulate the 360 controller. So instead of spending a lot of money on a wired 360 official controller, you can buy any sort of USB-compatible controller and use that. If you want to avoid all this trouble and don't mind the extra cost, you'll just want to buy a Wired 360 controller and download that software for your computer/laptop. Microsoft also has what is called a Microsoft® gaming receiver for Windows® that allows you to plugin wireless controllers into your PC. It is a discontinued product though, I think..but Amazon is showing them for less than $20 [here](http://www.amazon.com/Xbox-360-Wireless-Gaming-Receiver-Windows/dp/B000HZFCT2/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1347289435&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=Microsoft%C2%AE+gaming+receiver+for+Windows%C2%AE).  Many people have problems installing the driver that comes with the XBCD 0.2.7 release. I just told Windows to allow the unsigned drivers and was good to go.  Download http://www.mediafire.com/?32e4566jjj5nzja - XBCD 0.2.7 Release  This is mainly just used for the drivers. Once this is installed there are 2 options for setting up the files needed for emulation  You can use the app version: x360ce.App-2.0.2.158.  &gt; &gt;With this once extracted run the x360ce.exe and it should determine what controller you have and load a profile for you. If it does not you can setup which buttons you want to do what. Once saved this adds 2 more files to the folder than the exe is in : &gt;x360ce.ini &gt;xinput1_3.dll &gt; &gt;Some games use different .dll names - the 4 they could be are : &gt;xinput1_1.dll &gt;xinput1_2.dll &gt;xinput1_3.dll &gt;xinput9_1_0.dll &gt; &gt;What I did , instead of trial and error to see which one works, was make one of each and I just copy all 4 into the game directory along with the ini file. .  Or use the manual config version: x360ce_vibmod_3.1.4.1.  &gt;With this you have to manual edit the x360ce.ini file(in notepad or any text editor) and add the VID &amp; PID, which are easy to find. &gt; &gt;Control Panels &gt; System &gt; Device manager &gt; Human Interface Device &gt; find your controller listed&gt; right click &gt; properties &gt; details &gt; switch the drop down to hardware Ids. It will list both your VID &amp; PID &gt; &gt;Enter those in the top of the x360ce.ini &gt; &gt;VID=0x045E                   #controller VID &gt;PID=0x0289                   #controller PID &gt; &gt; &gt;Also change the FakeAPI=0 to FakeAPI=1 Save the file. &gt; &gt;Test the setup with the included XInputTest.exe to make sure all the buttons function correctly. &gt; &gt;Same here, you want 4 dll files : &gt;xinput1_1.dll &gt;xinput1_2.dll &gt;xinput1_3.dll &gt;xinput9_1_0.dll &gt; &gt;and the &gt; &gt;x360ce.ini &gt; &gt;and you will copy them to the the game install directory.

t5_2tnz9,Illuminatesfolly,1347273758,"&gt;no denying that it got resounding popular and critical acclaim.  Well, it's a controversial film... Critics, as well as the populace, are widely divided in their opinions of this film. Some people do actually think it is a bad movie, not because it was ""melodramatic schlock"", as some of the commenters in the thread do, but because it has a confused genre and makes some other mistakes with film grammar. I'll agree and say that vehemently hating the film is a ridiculous position to hold, but that's more because the film does have a distinct artistic vision, however poorly executed it might be (in the eyes of some).   To be honest, it isn't contributing to the discussion of the film (or the other's listed) to say that the opinions held regarding these films are the result of a sense of superiority or some kind of misunderstood genius complex. Reddit is not one agent with one set of opinions. I wouldn't say that all of the commenters in this thread hold their opinions simply because they don't want to be associated with Reddit as a whole. For me to hold such a position would be about as stupid as the commenters that I would claim to criticize. Sometimes people just don't like films, for legitimate reasons that have come from their study of film. I would also agree again that most people on Reddit are not film scholars but, I am also sure that some people in the larger subs would be well categorized by that description.   &gt;You didn't like No Country for Old Men or V for Vendetta? You obviously didn't understand all the deep things it was saying about society.  Well, if you thought *Slumdog Millionaire* was a better film than either of those titles, then I would be interested in your opinion and whether or not it spans beyond ""Those films are pretentious and Reddit likes them, so I do not"". More than social commentaries (where they clearly beat Slumdog Millionaire), the titles are also plainly better executed films... and however well done the cinematography was in *Slumdog Millionaire*, it certainly does not beat the Coen brothers.  Sure, Reddit can be superficial and circlejerky about their opinions, but come on, you are making out their difference of opinion as being literally worse than Hitler™ and writing a post that is appealing to circlebroke's taste in films (anything that Reddit hates-- as an unfair generalization of my own).   &gt;maybe i'm reading into this way too far  Yeah, maybe.

t5_2qh33,TheSox3,1347291961,"So I was standing in a rather large line at my local Wal-Mart today behind a couple families that I know from when I went to swag school with my family in year younger. It was the only register open so there wasn't much of another option to get my 12 pack of Mountain Dew for a party I was heading to. I was wondering why the line was going nowhere when I decided to poke my head up front to see what the holdup was. It was a little old lady who didn't have enough for her groceries and she was trying to talk the cashier into letting her get away with being short. This struck me as odd until I found out she was a mere $0.21 short of her purchase. Now all these families were just staring and there was even two making fun of her. I walked up and handed my soda to the cashier, handed him a $5 and told her to keep the change. One of the kids in line (a BurgerKing employee..I knew these people, so I also knew that they all make over 6 digits) grabbed his swagalicious friend and yelled very loudly, ""See that man? He's acting just like Waka Flocka Flame wants us to."" For some reason this set me off, so I turned around. I haven't shaved in awhile so I'm rocking some nice scruff, a My Little Pony shirt, and gym shorts, so it must have been a nice sight. Very loudly, I said ""Like Waka Flocka? Good gentlemanly sir, I'm a redditor who doesn't practic swagism and I was the one who stepped up to help her? Your hypocritical practice of swag^® is an inspiration to us all."" As I stormed out, a couple of the cart boys started to whistle and cheer, soon shoppers joined in and even the cashier. I gave a wave and went off with a feeling of accomplishment.",®

I doubt you and partner in an effort to get healthy by quitting smoking and starting running have all of sudden started binging out on donuts...You are more likely gaining weight because of combination of the lack of nicotine and it's fat burning properties(1), as well as the hormonal effects of steady state cardio(2).   My advice would be to cut down carbs to around 20-30/day and eat as much fat and protein as you want, find a gym and lift heavy weights 1-3 times a week. Maybe one of you tries this method and the other one doubles down on calorie counting and running? Report back with your results!  (1)Systemic nicotine stimulates human adipose tissue lipolysis through local cholinergic and catecholaminergic receptors, K Andersson and P Arner, International Journal of Obesity.  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11477508)   (2) http://articles.elitefts.com/training-articles/women-running-into-trouble/  When I look at the fat guy in the gym wasting his time on forearm curls to lose weight, I don’t feel sympathy. The big tough guy getting stapled to the bench by 365 pounds, when just a second ago he couldn’t even handle 315 pounds — nope, no sympathy there either. The girl who spends thirty minutes bouncing between the yes-no machines (abductor and adductor machines), who is going to have trouble walking the next day — I can’t muster even an iota of pathos. Nobody told them to do these things. But then I watch my friend, Jessica, running on the treadmill, day after day, year after year, running like a madwoman and going nowhere. Her body seems to get softer with every mile and the softer she gets the more she runs. I do feel pity for her because everybody, everywhere has convinced her that running is the way to stay slim and toned.  There’s a Jessica in every gym and spotting one is easy. The woman that runs for an hour or more every day on the treadmill, who every month or so sets a new distance or time goal. Maybe the goal encompasses the treadmill workouts; maybe it will be her fifth fund-raising marathon; or maybe she’s competing with runners in Finland via Nike®. The goal doesn’t matter, because years of seeing her on the treadmill exposes the results: she’s still — I’m not going to sugar coat this — fat. Or worse, she’s fatter....... Think about it this way: the body is a responsive, adaptive machine evolved for survival. If running on a regular basis, the body senses excessive energy expenditure and adjusts to compensate. Remember, no matter what dreamy nonsense we invent about how we hope the body works, its endgame is always survival. Start wasting energy running and the body reacts by slowing the metabolism to conserve energy. Decreasing energy output is biologically savvy for the body: survive longer while doing this stressful, useless activity — as the body views it. Decreasing T3 production, increases efficiency and adjusts metabolism to preserves energy quickly.  Nothing exemplifies this increasing efficiency better than how the body starts burning fuel. Training at a consistently plus-65 percent heart rate adapts the body to save as much body fat as possible. That’s right, after regular training, fat cells stop releasing fat during moderate-intensity activities like they once did.32-33 Energy from body fat stores decreases by a whopping 30 percent. 34-35 To this end, the body even sets into motion a series of reactions that make it difficult for muscle to burn fat at all.36-41 Instead of burning body fat, the body is taking extraordinary measures to hold on to it. Still believe cardio is the fast track to fat loss?  But wait. By acting now, you too can lose muscle mass. That’s right. No more muscle because too much steady-state cardio triggers the loss of muscle.42-45 This seems to be a two-fold mechanism, with heightened and sustained cortisol levels triggering muscle loss,46-56 which upregulates myostatin, a potent destroyer of muscle tissue.57 Oh yeah — say good bye to bone density too — it declines with the muscle mass and strength.58-64 And long-term health? Out the window as well. The percentage of muscle mass is an independent indicator of health.65 Lose muscle, lose bone, lose health—all in this nifty little package.   ",®

t5_2rfxx,petapanfriedrice,1347321747,"Original post is worth a look too...its a bit heartbreaking actually  &gt;http://na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=2557429  &gt;Some people actually get upset because of what you say.  &gt;I'm going to be as truthful as possible right now. I'm 24 years old and I have social anxiety disorder. I'm also borderline bi-polar. I take medication that helps me not have mood swings without any explanation but I still react to real things accordingly. The only problem is when I do react to things the emotion is usually exaggerated. I don't mean that it's unreasonable, but if you and I both were sad over the same exact thing I would be more sad. The same for anger, joy, and so on.  &gt;My ignore feature has been bugged since five or six patches ago and I'm no longer able to ignore other players. My ignore list isn't full. Thus, while in-game, I have to deal with what other people say. I'm a young adult. I understand what that all means. The problem is that it's a lot easier to get a rise out of me than with other people. If people are condescending me non-stop I will tell them that it's making me upset. I always read the chat and unless I'm very focused on a fight it's very hard for me to ignore.  &gt;At the end of my games I say ""Thank you for the game everyone, have a nice day."" I've always been extremely empathetic and very caring of other people. It doesn't matter if they are strangers or not because I can't help but be that way. I was raised to be polite and understanding of others. As I grew up living on my own I made it a point to always be respectable and kind to others because that's how I would like to be treated.  &gt;So, when I respond to people that spit about a myriad of degrading remarks it seems like that gives them the go-ahead to say even more mean things. Eventually my feelings overcome my ability to be calm and I get upset. I don't generally get angry, just sad. There's a quote from 'The Green Mile' that has stuck with me for a long time.  &gt;""Mostly I'm tired of people being ugly to each other. I'm tired of all the pain I feel and hear in the world everyday. There's too much of it. It's like pieces of glass in my head all the time. Can you understand?""  &gt;That's how I feel when people are being so downright awful during the game. Yet, if I try to say anything about it they just turn the cruelty up a notch and lay it on even thicker. When I tell people I'm considering reporting them for verbal abuse they just press on and be as antagonizing as possible. Generally people say to 'suck it up' or 'stop being a baby.' The only thing is, I'm not being a child about it. I don't like having mean things said to me so I want you to stop. Where is the wrong in that?  &gt;It isn't my fault that I developed these problems that hinder my control of my emotions. It isn't my fault that I sweat uncontrollably when I start having anxiety. I don't like to have a slew of unpleasant feelings coursing through my veins and I don't like having to change my shirt after a game of League of Legends because I feel disgusting.  &gt;I'm sure some people will jump in here and bash on what I have to say. I've been as honest as I could possibly be to put this on a public forum. Can you say that you've been as honest with yourselves? Troll all you want, but I'm writing this because I am sick of how terrible people act towards others. We're all peers here. We all all playing a video game to have some fun. Start saying things like ""Don't worry, we'll get them next time."" instead of ""You (explicative) suck!"" when gameplay is going poorly.  &gt;All in all, what I really want to say is, there are real people on the other end of these Summoner name's. Real people just like you. Real people that like being happy more than they are sad. Some of them can't help but get upset because they have less choice in their emotions due to problems that they didn't ask for.  &gt;Thank you for your time.  &gt;EDIT: (copy/paste of my latest post to this thread) Thanks again to everyone that's taken the time out of their night to read and respond. I appreciate everyone's input on what I've had to say. I really didn't think this was going to start up such a discussion!  &gt;I'm going to get off of here for the night. I tried to read and reply as much as I could.  &gt;Much love to everyone.  &gt;I'll check up on the thread either before I go to bed or tomorrow morning.  &gt;Have a good night everyone and I hope you all go 20/0 in your next game. ♥",♥

t5_mouw,TheAmityvillain,1347345449,"**BACKGROUND**: Testicular germ cell tumor (TGCT) incidence increased steadily in recent decades, but causes remain elusive. Germ cell function may be influenced by cannabinoids, and 2 prior epidemiologic studies reported that the use of marijuana may be associated with nonseminomatous TGCT. Here, the authors evaluate the relation between TGCTs and exposure to marijuana and other recreational drugs using a population-based case-control study.  **METHODS**: In total, 163 patients who were diagnosed with TGCT in Los Angeles County from December 1986 to April 1991 were enrolled, and 292 controls were matched on age, race/ethnicity, and neighborhood. Participants were asked about drug use by a structured, in-person interview. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using conditional logistic regression analysis adjusted for history of cryptorchidism; education; religiosity; and reported use of marijuana, cocaine, and amyl nitrite.  **RESULTS**: Compared with never use, ever use of marijuana had a 2-fold increased risk (OR, 1.94; 95% CI, 1.02-3.68), whereas ever use of cocaine had a negative association with TGCT (OR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.32-0.91). Stratification on tumor histology revealed a specific association of marijuana use with nonseminoma and mixed histology tumors (OR, 2.42; 95% CI, 1.08-5.42).  **CONCLUSIONS**: A specific association was observed between marijuana use and the risk of nonseminoma and mixed tumors. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of a negative association between cocaine use and TGCT risk. The current results warrant mechanistic studies of marijuana's effect on the endocannabinoid system and TGCT risk and caution that recreational and therapeutic use of cannabinoids by young men may confer malignant potential to testicular germ cells.

t5_2tfde,jasenlee,1347352187,"Coming home a couple of weeks ago I was walking up the steps when I spotted some dark spot on my front porch. I didn't really pay much attention to it because it was small. Then a couple of days later I noticed another one near it. Coming back home again later that day I saw that they had grown in size. I kneeled down to look and the color wasn't really black but it wasn't really brown which is what I was expecting. It was an extremely dark red. It was dried blood soaked into the wood.   I started to feel dizzy and then all around me different images, things and beings started to come to life. If you can imagine staring at a new balloon yet to be inflated and on it is painted this whole new world. That started to inflate all around me. This my mee-maw had always told me was dark magic. Beware of the little people, banshees and unicorn lions mee-maw said. This smelled like the work of the little people.   Suddenly a little robin flew into a tree that was above my head. I thought it was going to sing me a song but then it transformed into [this](http://winniecooper.net/flores/pics/b&amp;w%20cat%20eyes%20spinning.gif) and then I knew for sure mee-maw was right. I must have been captured by the little people.   They proceeded to torture and starve me for like a really long time.   I thought I was done for and then this bustalicious woman came flying through the wall like the Kool-Aid™ man. She screamed like that one bitch in [Run Lola Run](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCjxhCSzNaU) and said ""NOT THIS ONE!"" and an angry frog god wearing a baseball hat came out of the clouds and grumbled ""Yes Dark Magic Titties, this one belongs to me. It has been foretold, now begone with you hussie of the Wind and Seas"".   Dark Magic Titties sneered and said ""I don't think so, not this time Tom Cruise!"" But Dark Magic Titties was known for her clever nature. She thought about it and just as Tom Cruise was ready to fly away she said ""I'll tell you what, let's have a bet? If you can find me one word in the entire world which rhymes with ""orange"" in the next 7 days I will give you jasenlee. If not, he is free to go and I gain your secret power of shooting powerful death rays from my body. Only unlike you I won't shoot them from my eyes but from my DARK MAGIC TITTIES.""  Tom Cruise, one who was never a stranger to erratic and impulsive actions, decided to take this bet. The first couple of days he blew it off and sang songs with his little people. They danced and ate what little people and frog god kings eat and generally had themselves a good time. Finally old Tom Cruise decided he should start searching for that word. He searched and searched but ran out of time.   &lt;getting tired of writing this horseshit&gt;  Finally he had to give old what's her face the death ray shit and everyone got all their crap back. Jasenlee went home. Dark Magic Titties added some Death Ray shit to her flair and then Tom Cruise went back to whatever fucking space world he lives in.   That my dear is how you got this flair. Or should I say Miss Dark Magic Titties?  EDIT: Changed some stuff around. I'm gonna keep doing it until I get bored.)",™

So where is this      Limbo Land?      What is this blank     Mist shrouding the path to the     Phenomenal world?      Again I sit naked on the     Mountain top, but at     55, I do not bleed into the     Earth, I am the Earth,     The sustainer of all life.      Without me nothing     Would exist, and yet     Nothing does exist, For it is all mist.      Not seeking to please or be pleased,     Neither begging nor commanding,     It is as if time has stopped. The taskmaster is done,     Laid off. It’s time to      Enjoy the view, the curious nature of this     Unfathomable mystery.      Isn’t that what a child does?     Explore the present moment without     Expectation?      So it seems that the half circle of 55 is like     Eyes seeing into the future and the past,     Acknowledging that coming full circle     Does not equal death, sadness, loss or     Defeat, nor a new beginning of     Endless striving.      No, this is a realization that the     Ending of the endless cycle is but a     Moment of sitting shrouded in the      Mist, and not needing to see     Beyond it, but      Embracing the mystery of it like a      Child who feels the first snow upon     It’s face, Staring into the open sky.

Acknowledging whether you know something or not is very important in the process of learning. If you do not acknowledge that you do not know something, then how can you learn it?  I also find it interesting in quote 7-19 that Confucius states he is not born with the possession of knowledge, just the fondness for it. In Chapter 2 on Human Nature Confucius clearly states that some people are born with knowledge. Is it just me or are some people *cough* (Confucius) contradicting themselves?  Also, since Dr. Bishop said to not hesitate when asking questions, can someone explain quote 12-22 to me? How will the “crooked” be made upright if they are put aside? Who are those considered “crooked”? Are they criminals, people who are mentally ill, who?  On to Dewey, I see that Dewey really believes in applied knowledge. He states that knowledge resides in the consequences of directed action (The Quest for Certainty, p. 196), and then states that knowledge is only valuable when it is effective (Democracy and Education, p. 347) I believe this kind of relates to our general/specific knowledge argument. Aristotle also states a similar idea, that those experiencing are better off than those theorizing.   We also go back to Chapter 2 on Human Nature in the quote from Human Nature and Conduct, p. 177.  Dewey draws the line between habits, impulses, and knowledge. Habits and impulses do not allow for observation and reflection, because we are so accustomed to doing them that we don’t usually stop and think. However, a certain combination of both will allow for observation, memory, and judgment.  If any of you have the answers to my questions please give me your answers and opinions. Thanks ☺ ",☺

And maybe the Iranian people were still a little *miffed* at having had to put up with 38 years of torture, arbitrary incarceration and summary execution at the hands of an American stooge, his  brutal US-supplied military, and his merciless, CIA-trained SAVAK secret police? And the fact that the people who had *created* that situation were, in fact, our best friends, whom we supported unequivocally in all matters of diplomacy and international policy?  But to get to your substantive point: so we screw up an already tense international relationship by pulling a lot of diplomatic shenanigans in 1979, and then not only do we blame the other guy for not forgiving us fast enough for our liking, now we call him a terrorist, unFriend him, and delete his number from our iPhone? Good, sound diplomatic policy, that. Well thought out.

t5_2qh1i,yourdadsbff,1347425133,"Alright, fine, I'll be the Annoying Atheist™ and ask why you feel the need to give your daughter such a thorough religious education. I mean, sure, if she has questions or what have you then by all means answer them; take her to church if she's curious (or perhaps have her go with family friends who are more religious and thus might be able to better answer her questions?) and show her relevant literature, etc.   But, I mean, I feel like presenting all these religions like a spiritual deck of cards is something that *sounds* really good to do but kind of seems, I dunno, unnecessary? I mean, you're going to ""introduce everything to her"" and then she's almost certainly going to ask what *you* believe and you're going to answer, I presume, honestly: you don't believe any of that stuff, and in fact you don't have religious beliefs at all. And we forget that oftentimes, it's not that parents ""lead their children towards their own beliefs"" but rather that children *choose to take up* the beliefs of their parents. When she asks you why you're atheist, what are you going to tell her? You think it's all bunk. (So do I.) And I don't really love the implicit assumption I see going on in these comments that one *must* or even *ought to* receive a comprehensive education on any number of religions in order to ""gain a better perspective"" or what have you.   I'm an atheist who was raised (very reform) Jewish, but essentially secularist (holidays, Hanukkah presents, and the Bar Mitzvah circuit were the extent of my religious practices). Before my family even left our temple, I had already ""become"" an atheist, and I feel like once you reach that point, it's pretty much impossible to *seriously consider* ""converting"" to another religion (and frankly, I don't understand people who claim to have done so, though it's not like I hold their decision against them or anything). I don't feel like I have spiritually or intellectually ""missed out"" by not going to mosque and church services for a month or having my parents patiently explain the tenets and background of every major world religion, in addition to ancient mythology.  Teaching her to keep and open mind and explore her intellectual curiosities is one thing. But I feel like religion isn't *The Price Is Right*. You can't just reveal each prize (i.e. religion) and then ask her to pick which one she wants. I don't fully understand why you don't expect her to trust your instincts (as her father) and disregard the religious inquiry that you at one point or another came to reject.   Also, do you plan to explain to her why you're ""biased against Christianity and towards Buddhism""? And what does it mean to be ""biased towards"" a religion anyway?",™

If the question comes up, be honest in what you believe and explain to her as she grows the details of why you came to where you are.

t5_2rmaw,thebest99,1347492981,"For some reason the websites security certificate isnt working so ill just post the article here for anyone not wanting to go on the site:  Public Health Advisory from the Director of Force Health Protection On 18 May 2012, a Base Surgeon notified the Directorate Force Health Protection (D FHP) of three cases of rhabdomyolysis requiring hospitalization; one case required dialysis for acute renal failure. Two of three cases reported doing “CrossFit®”, a type of Extreme Conditioning Program (ECP), prior to their diagnosis. The three cases originated from the same base and presented to the medical clinic over a short time period between March and May, 2012.   Exertional rhabdomyolysis (ER) has been reported most commonly in weight lifters, endurance athletes, and military personnel (particularly at the recruit level). It is associated with considerable morbidity in terms of lost duty time, hospitalization, and medical treatment.  Although few studies have examined the burden of this illness in civilian and military populations, a recent descriptive study using hospital and administrative data of the active component of the U.S. Armed Forces found the diagnosis of ER increased by 70 percent from 2006 to 2010. This study noted that personnel were more likely to develop ER if they were male, less than 26 years of age, were African-American, had a length of service of less than 90 days, suffered from a previous heat injury and had not deployed during the study period. (reference A).  As ER can be associated with potentially life threatening complications, a preliminary investigation was initiated to identify other possible cases of rhabdomyolysis in CF personnel to determine the magnitude of the problem. Laboratory reports with an elevated creatine kinase (CK) level of greater than 4,000 U/L from the Canadian Forces Health Information System (CFHIS) were used to identify additional cases. Twenty-one cases were identified between April 2011 and May 2012. Health record review found 18 of these 21 cases had participated in some form of exercise/fitness program, workout, or competition. Documentation in 10 of 18 health records specifically mentioned CrossFit® as a possible risk factor. These numbers likely represent an underestimate of the true incidence of rhabdomyolysis since only the most severe cases were captured (i.e., the cases had a CK value greater than 4,000 U/L, sought medical attention at a CF medical treatment facility and discrete laboratory data is only available at about half of all CFHIS sites).   ECPs, such as CrossFit®, P90x®, and Insanity®, have increased in popularity over the past few years. These programs are characterized by frequent, repetitious, high intensity exercises with very short rest periods between sets/cycles and little recovery time between workouts. Some ECPs do not encourage participants to progressively increase their workloads in an effort to allow for training adaption. CF personnel who participate may not have the requisite knowledge to properly set the required work to rest ratios to offset injury or illnesses possibly associated with ECPs. A disproportionate number of injuries such as muscle strains, sprains, stress fractures and rhabdomyolysis associated with ECPs have been cited in anecdotal reports and case studies, however, few studies have looked at the relationship between ECPs and injuries to date. (reference B)  ECPs are not endorsed by Personnel Support Programs (PSP), Directorate of Fitness (DFIT) or D FHP for reasons noted in para 4. DFIT has reviewed ECPs and has incorporated some of the recognized benefits into their physical fitness programs. To reduce the risk of injuries, DFIT has also developed a Tactical Athlete User Clinic, which educates and trains CF personnel on how to safely perform complex weight lifting techniques commonly found in ECPs (e.g., clean and squat). In addition, two courses (the Basic Fitness Training Assistant (BFTA) and the Advanced Fitness Training Assistant (AFTA)) are offered to CF personnel who are interested in leading safe and effective unit physical training. Local PSP fitness personnel are also available to provide information and guidance on safe training principles and other conditioning programs that incorporate accepted training doctrine.  Based on the results of this initial investigation, it is recommended that patients presenting with muscle pain and/or weakness, swelling, limited range of motion or tea coloured urine be asked about the type, amount and start date of any recent strenuous physical activity including engaging in ECPs, such as CrossFit®. In patients presenting without the cardinal sign of tea coloured urine, a differential diagnosis of ER should still be considered if they have a history of recent intense physical activity (including CrossFit®), especially in patients reporting a sudden increase in activity. Appropriate diagnostic blood work, including serum CK, should be drawn. (reference C and D).  It is recommended that patients be counselled regarding the dangers of ECPs and that they are informed of mitigating factors that can help prevent ER (e.g., gradual training progression, adequate hydration, appropriate rest periods, factoring in the effects of heat and humidity, and individualized training) for preventing ER. Patients should also be referred to their local PSP fitness personnel for guidance on safe and effective fitness training. (reference B, E and F)  CF Health Services Group will continue to gather more detailed information on current ER cases.  New cases should be reported to D FHP by email at +DFHP Iinquiries@CMP DGHS@Ottawa-hull.",®

t5_2uk27,saijanai,1347503960,"I should also correct a few things...  .  1) MUM isn't owned by the TM organization. It is certainly true that it is run by True Believers™ and can't be called an ""independent organization"" in any meaningful sense of the word, but the TM organization is itself a not-for-profit educational organization.  .  2) Calling Fairfield, IA a ""training center for TM"" is a bit misleading. It is the site of the national TM HQ, has the largest concentration of TMers, etc., but only about 10% of the town actually does TM, and that ignores the fact that quite a few people have quit TM and are now doing other spiritual practices instead.  .  3) Robert Park and other detractors of the DC study are in turn accused of their own brand of distortion [by the people who conducted the study](http://istpp.org/crime_prevention/voodoo_rebuttal.html).    .  4) Even though the researchers involved in producing these studies are all True Believers of the highest order, they're not complete fools, at least IMHO.

These parking stickers do not “just blow off”.  • We offer two different types of adhesives. Our ScrapeIt™ stickers use a strong adhesive that the driver must use a blade to remove. Yes, this is doable – but a real nuisance. Let them think twice next time! Our ClingIt™ stickers have an adhesive that keeps your sticker in place. Yet, you can remove this label cleanly. Of course, in many cases (e.g. the driver’s first infraction), many security officers may not want stick the violation notice to the window. Instead, officers often just place the sticker underneath the wiper, with the still liner attached.  • Our no parking violation stickers are 8"" x 5” - twice as large as the mini labels sold by competitors.

t5_2rbaq,titanemesis,1347553170,"Aye, 300$ is not a realistic amount to expect to pay, for anything even remotely habitable. Now, fair warning: you may find too-good-to-be-true offers and postings on craigslist, kijiji etc. These are either scams, or bad situations. Generally, when something goes for 300$, it's usually a 'room' in somone's house or apartment. The bad news is, you have zero rights (seriously, absofuckinglutely NONE) as a tenant, since the RTA doesn't cover renting space on a property that you share with your landlord. In short, if you live with your landlord (which you most likely will, for that price), you're probably GonnnaHaveABadTime™  Housing Services are great resource, and I do recommend speaking to them. Talk to Ali Shahabuddin in particular. He runs a service called the 'Home Ranger', and he can set up a one-on-one meeting to give you a realistic idea of what the rental market is like, and how best to find a place on your budget. They can also put you in touch with trusted landlords (via the housing website), and possibly roommates.   As for your classes, you're going to feel the pressure around mid-october, when mid-terms kick in. If you have a lot of half year courses, the pace really starts to ramp up.   Protip: plan out ahead of time (as much as possible) when your assignments are due, and when your mid terms &amp; in-class tests are going to happen. There's a good chance there will be conflicts, or things due back-to-back. A LOT of profs will be willing to give you wriggle room on your assignments (i.e. extensions), provided you approach them well ahead of time, and you have a reasonable proposal for an extension (1 - 3 days, sure. 1 - 3 weeks = lolgtfo).",™

t5_2rfxx,Maraudingcaptain,1347561667,"For those at work:  NA Regionals were last week. Coming into the event, what were your expectations?   Chauster: I expected to finish top 3. I was feeling pretty confident coming into the tournament because I feel like the North American scene is among the weakest in the competitive scene right now and we had improved a good amount.     How did it compare to past events such as MLG and IPL?   Chauster: The venue was pretty amazing. The design and the ambience made it feel like it was a huge event, which for League of Legends players it was. Riot also treated all the players well and provided a night of fun at the arcade so we were all taken care of.   You beat Legion in your first round 2-1 pulling out a mass TP strategy in games 1 and 2. What was the reasoning behind this?   Chauster: Most people think it is stupid to show your strategies in the first round of the tournament. However, since the NA regionals were single elimination we could not afford to lose in the first round, so we used our strategy we crafted in Korea. The strategy is pretty simple and revolves around split pushing. After laning phase the team with the teleports just have to group up and push 1 or 2 lanes while the promote minion secretly pushes another lane.This produces pressure on all 3 lanes. Teams will have to send at least one person to each lane to deal with the threat or lose free objectives. They will have to respond, and when that happens, my team can at any point collapse on one single point (a tower or Baron) and force an objective. You rinse and repeat this over and over and eventually you just win the game from securing free objectives    Coming into the games vs Team Dignitas, were you confident in a win? How did you think the games were going to play out?   Chauster: I was not confident because historically my team has a problem playing against Dignitas. Their playstyle somewhat counters ours and as a result we have a tougher time facing them. I thought the series was going to be close and go 2-1 to either team.     After losing 2-0 to Dignitas, what was going through your mind after that 76 minute game?   Chauster: I didn't really think about too many things other than the fact that if we lost the game versus Curse the next day we would be in deep shit. I know that if Dignitas played the game correctly, we would have had no chance to come back into the game. However, Dignitas threw the game and let us get a baron and gave us complete control of the game. However, we tossed the game back into the hands of Dignitas with horrible decision making and ultimately did not deserve to win.     What went wrong in those matches?   Chauster: The first game every lane did well except top lane, and it snowballed very hard. Originally we picked Vladmir to outscale Irelia and it is pretty much an impossibility to lose lane with jungle Shen pressure. Voyboy managed to lose lane with this and we did not have an exhaust to deal with the fed Irelia. This made team fights very hard even though we outcomped them so heavily and we just lost the game.  Second game they caught us off guard with their poke comp and we did not have a hard initiate. As a result they played it out well in the beginning but ended up giving us a chance to win the game. The biggest mistake I remember is Doublelift getting too greedy and dying in Dignitas' base when the inhibitors were up. We could have taken 2 inhibitors and snowballed the game to the end but we failed when he died randomly.     How did you feel knowing you would be facing Curse in the third place match with so much history between them and yourselves?   Chauster: I felt pretty confident because we know how Saint plays and we know that our team does very well against Curse's set of players. We were given enough information from the previous rounds of the tournament to also not run into anything unexpected so we were able to predict and prepare for most outcomes.     After winning against Curse 2-0 to secure your spot in the S2 final next month, what emotions were you going through?   Chauster: I was relieved that we did not have to go home losers. CLG has been losing popularity in recent months because of our stint in Korea and a loss at Regionals would have sealed our fate as a mediocre team that has fallen from grace. Now we are still known as one of the top teams in NA and have another chance to redeem ourselves.     If you could go back and give yourself/teammates advise coming into the regionals, what would it be?   Chauster: Suck your pride up and only play champions you know you can play. Don't waste time playing things outside of your comfort zone, chances are you will never be good enough doing it anyways.     You are now going to live in a gaming house with CLG.NA and CLG.EU to prepare for the S2 finals, will you be exclusivly scrimming each other, or do you plan to scrim other teams too?   Chauster: We plan on scrimming other teams too. Scrimming exclusively against one team has a lot of downsides.     Can we expect more crazy strategies being prepared in this time?   Chauster: Perhaps. We will see come S2 Finals.     What are your predictions for the S2 Finals?   Chauster: I don't really have many predictions because there are too many teams and any team can beat another team on any given day at the finals.   What’s the future like for CLG.NA after S2 finals are done with?   Chauster: After S2 finals are done with we will have to sit down and talk about our plans for S3. We need to solidify our roster and recruit subs in case any of us can't make events or starts underperforming. I am sure everyone will go home after S2 finals are done also for a small vacation.     Any shoutouts?   Chauster: Shoutout to CLG sponsors Razer, own3d, and XMG. You can follow me at my non-twitter at facebook/LoLChauster or come into my channel on IRC @ #chauster.

But if you want to discuss talking points, here's another one:  In another blatant example of both unethical Tory deck-stacking *and* cynical Tory featherbedding, in May, the Harper Government™  tried to appoint a twice-failed  Conservative candidate, Guy Dufort, as arbitrator in an ongoing dispute between Canada Post and CUPW.   Amazingly enough, Dufort had also been - now get this, el notario - *a former labour lawyer for Canada Post* for five years! Even better, he had actually fought CUPW in court on a massive pay equity claim the union had filed - and he had lost, bigtime! His execrable courtroom performance, and his subsequent loss of tens of millions of dollars in CUPW back pay claims, caused him to be summarily dropped as counsel by Canada Post, just a few days later.   Even better than *that*: these were, unfortunately, facts he neglected to mention in the the 35 pages of self-serving justifications he gave in his written refusal to recuse himself, when the union demanded he do so.  Despite his ongoing and best efforts to remain an agent of twisted Tory labour policy dressed in an arbitrator's honourable clothing, Dufort was unceremoniously kicked out on his ass  by the Honourable Danièle Tremblay-Lamer of the Federal Court, just five weeks ago. She took less than a day to render her decision.  Way to be fair, evenhanded and apolitical in your appointment of arbitrators, Tory Labour Minister Lisa Raitt! You gonna appoint el notario next?

This has nothing to do with trolling, it is (if the reports and translations are correct) just basic dishonesty and trying to look good to two different groups at the same time.

If they honestly mean what they say (and have no ulterior hidden motive) then it's not trolling, no matter how annoying it is. * Goal of making the victim react emotionally. If someone steals your wallet, they're not a troll, just a thief, because all they wanted was the money. * Any (optional) humor used always has the victim as the eventual butt of the joke.

I'm going to assume you do not know anything about rope.  There are two main rope styles you see in the US right now.  One is called fusion (look at the two knotty boys stuff) - that's influenced strongly by macrame and sailing knots.  The other is commonly called shibari (see twisted monk), which is derived from Japanese styles and traditions such as kinbaku and hojojutsu.  The main difference I see between the two is that fusion is far more knot centric and does usually take more time to tie up a person than shibari.  Shibari lends itself to being quick and efficient, but that's not to say that it can't be complex or that fusion can't be quick or efficient.  As for the things I recommend learning if you want to be a Rope Guy™:  * Two column tie (I prefer twisted Monk's) * I effectively only use three knots, but your style may dictate something else.  I use the overhand knot, the lark's head, and the somerville bowline (a single column tie).  I do know lots of other knots, such as the double coin, overhand, and the taut line hitch.  Some you use to just add some flair, some are practical in and out of bondage, and some I just know because I think they are aesthetically pleasing on their own. * The Takate Kote or ""TK"" is a basic harness that you see everywhere with lots of variation.  It can get you pretty far if you know how to tie one.  I can provide more information on safety, rope length, rope material, links to specific tutorials, or whatever else you might want to know about rope.  Just ask.",™

In my 25+ years of daily commuting around Tokyo on crutches and leg braces, I have been offered the Priority Seats for the handicapped fewer than 25 times.   Most but **not all** stations in Kanto the greater Tokyo area have an elevator or escalator. If you get turned around and use the wrong exit (Tokyo's Shinjuku station has more than 200 exits) you can find yourself ""trapped"" in an underground corridor with a several changes of grade that require to go up and down several flights of stairs. The corridors linking Tokyo station with Otemachi station seem to be the worst.  Another nasty example of piss-poor accessibility is at Tokyo's Shibuya station, one of the top 10 busiest in Japan. The terminus of Ginza Line does NOT have either an elevator or escalator and the narrow stairs are not level with steps sloped downward.

'struggle' is the key phrase I would use when describing the mish-mash layouts of the complicated train and subway stations. Some private train lines (serving the suburban areas) had elevators at most stations, but when connecting to the main stations (in our case Shibuya and Shinjuku) to transfer to the major train system (run by the government's Japan Rail) the grapple began. Dealing with an 18lb child, 12lb stroller and a few shopping bags isn't a severe hardship for two people to carry on stairs, but it would be an impossible experience for anyone dependent on a continuous system of ramps and elevators. If you go out the wrong exit point (and there's always many to chose from), you can be faced with twenty or thirty stairs (no other options) and an endless mega-swarm of people chaotically headed in all directions. You would have to buy another ticket to get back into the station gate and find the correct hodge-podge path to elevator your way out (then you'd have to explain why you supposedly didn't use the ticket). It was frequent that we found ourselves taking an elevator from the train platform to another level's platform to then crossover to another platform, walk to the other end to catch another elevator to get to the station level. And that's not necessarily street level. Often we'd connect to a department store basement and use the store's elevators and hope that we could exit the store without needing to step down to the street.   Another interesting aspect to all of this is that no one of authority, i.e., station agents, info booth attendants, and elevator girls really seemed to be sure if any path would be a continuous roll. And often their information was wrong or included a flight of stairs.",©

They're easier to relate to too. But I would enjoy the ability to choose some brief aspects about the protagonist's background much like the system in ME, with characters reacting differently to you based on that.  I'd like to see Hawke being mentioned in passing much like the Warden is in DA2. Better yet, a full cameo if you import -- since Bioware bothered to divide Hawke's personality into 3 distinct branches I think it wouldn't be too hard to have three versions of a Hawke character appear in DA3 (with your custom face and everything too!). I'm thinking maybe as a companion, or at least a supporting character. I mean they must have left the ending of DA2 open for a reason.  I know quite a few people who want Morrigan's kid to appear in DA3 but let's not forget that some people (me) sacrificed their Warden in DA:O and imported that save into DA2. If the kid appears at all I don't think it should be a major part of the storyline...  Well-developed, strong companions with elaborate backstories are a must. That was one of the things I really loved about DA2. It had its failings with its general plotline as a whole but I think the romance/friendship subplots were well done. I'd like to see something like that, combined with the epic, traditional fantasy feel of the story of DA:O.  None of these really have to do with the gameplay, lol... But it's not really my place to say anything about the gameplay since I play the game mostly for the story. I didn't even notice any major gameplay flaws of DA2 until I read the bad reviews (✌ﾟ∀ﾟ)☞ Go me.",✌

t5_2s3kh,drtrobridge,1347646627,"...and for those too lazy to click...  ""Grand Valley Metropolitan Council's Mobile Pavement Management System (PaMS), a new advanced technology tool to gather data on pavement conditions and help local and state officials make better decisions about road repairs and reconstruction is now in service n the Grand Rapids metropolitan area.  The GVMC PaMS is a full-size Ford® van equipped with state-of-the-art electronic pavement scanners, high-resolution still cameras, Global Positioning System (GPS) components and computers. Operated by experienced transportation planners from GVMC's Transportation Department, the equipment will be used throughout the GVMC transportation study area to ascertain pavement conditions and enable local road agencies and the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) to better manage roads, bridges and other elements of our region's surface transportation network.  It marks the first time that the mobile, semi-automated, advanced technology system will be used to gather and analyze road condition data in Michigan.  “This is a major step forward for our collaborative transportation planning efforts in the Grand Rapids metro area,” said Metro Council Chairman James Buck, Mayor of Grandville. “Once again, Metro Council is collaborating to share costs and employ the most-advanced technology, to benefit taxpayers and the motoring public in the Grand Rapids metropolitan region.”  During the construction season (April through November), GVMC's distinctive PaMS vehicle will travel the freeways and surface streets in the Grand Rapids metropolitan area, scanning and photographing pavement and other road and bridge infrastructure and storing the data for later analysis by GVMC transportation planners. While the van is being operated at normal road speeds, lasers scan the road surface to ascertain pavement conditions and GPS technology pinpoints the location of pavement deficiencies and adjacent transportation infrastructure. High-speed still cameras inventory and catalogue pavement conditions, together with road and bridge infrastructure (traffic signals, signs, street lamps, guard rails, etc.), and store the data and photographic images on high-capacity disk drives.  GVMC transportation planners and engineers then analyze the data and collaborate with public works officials and engineers from area cities and villages, the Kent and Ottawa County Road Commissions and MDOT to ascertain pavement conditions, catalogue deficiencies and prioritize road and bridge improvement projects.  “At a time when local taxpayers and motorists are rightly demanding that local officials collaborate and use more efficient methods for delivering critical services, GVMC has stepped up to meet that demand,” said GVMC Vice Chairman Don R. Hilton, Sr., Supervisor of Gaines Charter Township. “By putting state-of-the-art technology in the hands of experienced transportation planning professionals, and collaborating to share the costs, we're ensuring that the taxpayers' investments are wisely managed.”",®

The UK &amp; US have certainly contributed to if not directly created the situation in many on the list.  Even Iran - when the popular *secular* government kicked the UK out &amp; nationalised the oil industry the UK persuaded Eisenhower that the pro-USSR communists in the coalition were going to take over eventually, so the CIA funded &amp; created a coup d'etat, &amp; handed power to the Shah, which they supported despite his horrible repression until the Iranians had had enough in 1979 &amp; lo! and behold...they got an extreme theocracy instead.

t5_2qhqb,kenny-rogers,1347659842,"Consider the Duggan event last year, who could have predicted the animosity towards police that broke out? The film itself is obvious muslim baiting, and being published on youtube in July, having been made 12 months previously, why now is a great question. [Some are suggesting it was an organised revenge assassination attack](http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4280821,00.html). Who even came up with the narrative that this was about the film? What is the evidence?  I don't really see it as an explosion though. It's not really that significant in terms of violence, but it's a big deal because of the target and made a big deal by the press and military because that's what they do. Some reported that dead bodies were dragged through the streets to add more humiliation, but [actually they were dragged away from the fire and then to a hospital where the ambassador died of smoke inhalation](http://www.pbs.org/mediashift/2012/09/how-sam-bacile-bamboozled-the-ap-wall-street-journal-over-anti-muslim-film258.html). The ""enemy"" must be made to look as bad as possible to legitimise any force against them, or legitimise the expansion of empire. More people including nine children were killed by that [""one"" rogue US soldier terrorist](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/mar/19/afghanistan-american-imperialism-glenn-greenwald?utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter) for example, a death toll far higher than all these embassy ""riots"" as so far as I can make out.  It's almost impossible to pick this apart, but it is clear that the most significant uprisings have been around the middle eastern countries that have seen US/NATO aggression in recent times. Far eastern islamic states, or even middle eastern ""friendly"" islamic states like Saudi Arabia and Bahrain haven't made the headlines. The old wisdom is to ask who benefits? But it's unclear because there are so many players.  **""Common"" muslims** - they rarely benefit from violence, however there has been so much directed at them for many years now it is understandable that they would be resentful. It could be spontaneous insurrections or deliberately herded and directed by others.  &gt; [Predators launched 145 strikes on ex-regime targets. That was twice the barrage drones unleashed in all of 2011 on tribal Pakistan, the place commonly thought of as the epicenter of U.S. drone strikes.](http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/332810)  If people hate the film so much why haven't they gone after israeli embassies especially since Sam Bacile was on record as   **""Extreme"" muslims** - the most extreme muslims in Libya were the same ones that the west supported, so why should we be surprised when violence reoccurs? These people might use this as an excuse to further the ""brotherhood"" and gain political power, but it would seem odd to bite the hand that was feeding just a few months earlier. Have we seen this before? Western militaries know exactly what happens when you back extremists, Afghanistan is the example. You fracture a country, the same is happening in Syria.  **US military** - the Libyan response has been extreme, Obama® has moved warships and marines into the region. In fact they have proposed sending more ""security"" to all embassies around the world in ""counter terrorism"" measures. It certainly seems like an invasion by another name.  **Israel** - Obama® has quite publicly rebuffed Netanyahu's demands for war agains Iran. Like the US government has used [false flag strategies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Northwoods), [Israel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavon_Affair) (if we can even say it is separate) has a history of them as well. The film was obviously a propaganda film to incite hatred, but if so why not all muslim countries not just Libya? Obviously once the libya thing happened people got brave and it spread, even to the UK. I read I think a likudnik essay from the 70s or 80s about who the military strategy to advance israeli interests should revolve around destabilising neighbours through the provocation of sectarian violence. There was an attempt to frame Israel with the fake ""Sam Bacile"", fake quotes of calling islam caner, and probably fake jewish financiers.  So who knows? My best guess is that this is a media primed to make muslims look as bad as possible, deliberately distract from decades of aggression by UK/US/Israel as a contributing factor, and then like with 9/11, the military industrial complex has started to milk it for all its worth to expand the ""war on terror"". The PNAC essay [Rebuilding America's Defenses](http://www.newamericancentury.org/RebuildingAmericasDefenses.pdf) is one that gives insight into the current military aims of the US and Israel.  &gt; [Further, the process of transformation, even if it brings revolutionary change, is likely to be a long one, absent some catastrophic and catalyzing event – like a new Pearl Harbor.](http://www.newamericancentury.org/RebuildingAmericasDefenses.pdf) *[link fixed]**  I wish I could revisit the other one.

t5_2qhpn,keraneuology,1347667882,"&gt; There is a ton of supply that people aren't buying despite all-time low mortgage rates.  Where is it?  From the National Association of Realtors  &gt; WASHINGTON (April 26, 2012) – Pending home sales increased in March and are well above a year ago, another signal the housing market is recovering, according to the National Association of Realtors®.  &gt; The Pending Home Sales Index,* a forward-looking indicator based on contract signings, rose 4.1 percent to 101.4 in March from an upwardly revised 97.4 in February and is 12.8 percent above March 2011 when it was 89.9.  The data reflects contracts but not closings.  &gt; The index is now at the highest level since April 2010 when it reached 111.3.  &gt; Lawrence Yun, NAR chief economist, said 2012 is expected to be a year of recovery for housing.  “First quarter sales closings were the highest first quarter sales in five years.  The latest contract signing activity suggests the second quarter will be equally good,” he said.  &gt; “The housing market has clearly turned the corner.  **Rising sales are bringing down inventory** and creating much more balanced conditions around the county, which means home prices will be rising in more areas as the year progresses,” Yun said.   And more recently  &gt; WASHINGTON (August 29, 2012) - Pending home sales rose in July to the highest level in over two years and remain well above year-ago levels, according to the National Association of Realtors®.  &gt; The Pending Home Sales Index,* a forward-looking indicator based on contract signings, rose 2.4 percent to 101.7 in July from 99.3 in June and is 12.4 percent above July 2011 when it was 90.5. The data reflect contracts but not closings.  &gt; Lawrence Yun , NAR chief economist, said the index is at the highest level since April 2010, which was shortly before the closing deadline for the home buyer tax credit. ""While the month-to-month movement has been uneven, more importantly we now have 15 consecutive months of year-over-year gains in contract activity,"" Yun said.  &gt; **Limited inventory is constraining market activity.** ""All regions saw monthly increases in home-buying activity except for the West, which is now experiencing an **acute inventory shortage**,"" Yun added.  Inventory is tight and getting tighter.  Low value properties are quickly scarfed up by investors, high end properties often spark bidding wars and there just aren't as many homes in the middle as there are buyers these days.  Prices have been slowly increasing for a couple of years now and foreclosures are down.  Now it *feels* like you are right.  It *feels* like there is some major economic problems coming but I can't see anything to justify what my gut is telling me.  Most of the signs are positive and people have been warning about some major collapse that has been ""imminent"" for a couple of years now.",®

Evolutionary psychology is a bunch of bullshit that uses sparse studies and spins them into narratives that conform to current social prejudices.  Guys who are invested in evolutionary psychology and think of themselves as ""betas"" in order to justify their lack of a dating life usually have glaring issues in their perceptions of women that colour the way they interact with them. If you think women aren't into you because you're ""too nice,"" you're probably not very nice at all. You're probably a [Nice Guy™](http://www.harpyness.com/2010/07/07/nice-guys-tm-finish-last-for-good-reason/)  &gt; The ones being all concerned about why women make these choices—and how they can change their silly womanish ways—are the Nice Guys. Nice Guys can’t understand why their anger, criticism and sense of entitlement fail to attract women, or only attract women they deem “beneath them.” They also don’t see that their need to dictate women’s behavior so that we can better attract them is belittling, douche-y, and classic abuser mode.

t5_2qh36,plcplc,1347751260,"Words as such have no intrinsic meaning. The meaning of a piece of communication is defined exclusively by the receiver.  Thus, anybody who wants to take offence will be able to do so. And while this may even be legitimate, it's hardly constructive.  In my mind, inducing an agenda of male supremacy over females to an audience consisting of mostly SAPs of theoretical computer scientists seems a bit paranoid, especially when done by singling out the ambigous use of the word 'attractive'.   And because listeners are the sovereign of their own interpretations, discussion is limited to progress constructively only in the intersection of all (and particularly of adversarial) interpretations. So unless we can be brought to agree on the basic premises of the issue, we're basically limited to throwing mud.  In this case I see no common ground between my own opinion and the OP's, as I happened to interpret Swierstra's comment exclusively as a light-hearted phrasing of the observation that ♀s from a math background seem to prefer functional programming languages over imperative ones, and that there might be a point in promoting that. If the phrasing carried any emotional load, I would interpret it as mildly desparate and ironic, as the gender gap in CS is (in my mind) a detriment to the field, and I percieve that most other people involved feel the same way too.  (replace ♀ with whatever word indicating a subject of an individual of the Homo Sapiens (sapiens) species that happens to have two X chromosomes. Preferably one that does not offend you, for the sake of constructive dialogue)   **tl;dr:** While you're entitled to your opinion, I reserve the right to politely disagree.",♀

t5_2cneq,servohahn,1347762256,"Actually, Michigan was repeatedly essentially conquered and fought over by the French, British, and (when the US was established) Americans (after, of course, being violently wrested from the natives). Michigan endured battles and massacres, capture and recapture by various belligerents from 1759 until 1813. Then the militia of Michigan, who had formed a state government but were still not a part of the US, actually had a small skirmish with Ohio's militia over a territory dispute and the resolution more or less brought Michigan into the union. Michigan also was vital during the American Civil War.  The thing you have to realize about US history is that the various territories and states operated very independently in their infancy. Our federal government has slowly gained more power and influence since then, creating a slightly more unified country (which is funny recently, considering the schism between Republicans and Democrats). Frequently a territory or state had to fight for its own independence from its European parent and then join the Union afterwards. Even after winning their independence, the militias would often engage in warfare with Europe (usually British, French, or Spanish) controlled territories anyway (Edit: and Mexico), and on occasion territories that would eventually become a part of the United States would fight existing Union states or other ""American"" territories that would eventually become states as well. The way that states used to work was a lot more similar to a country's present contribution to EU than the present state contribution to the US.  The huge caveat is that state pride has all but evaporated. You see some of it in Texas still (the only state that is technically allowed to secede  from the Union) and, of course, when it comes to sporting events and occasional cultural differences. Not so with Ireland. Part of it is because Ireland has considered itself a sovereign nation and culturally independent for much longer than the US or any given state (back when state were more sovereign than they are now).   The only reason why I wanted to bring this all up is to point out that Americans sure do love to fight for independence, freedom, and (more recently) Freedom™. It does extend to our state histories as well which is why you have certain states (that will remain nameless) who hyperbolistically would like to put to death as many people as they possibly can and states like Michigan who have a history of resisting the death penalty with all their might.

t5_2s25d,JaneGael,1347762865,"That is a LOT of money for care unless the dog is an absolute mess.  I just had two of mine get into a scuffle and a 4"" tear and 4 punctures cost me $375 and that was with the $125 for walking in the door at midnight.  I'm close to NY too so prices are high, but that sounds over the top.    What concerns me is that if you wait very long for sutures (according to a vet I worked for) it is too late to suture as the tissue swells. Can you unwrap the bandages to treat the wounds yourself.  I've *very* successfully used Band-Aid Antiseptic Wash on a serious dog bite that I had that was too torn up to suture and I use it on my dogs all the time.  It is very cheap ($3.95) and it kills pain on contact as it's first ingredient is Lidocaine Hydrochloride an anesthetic.  Keep washing the wounds as often as you until you can get to a vet.  This will prevent infection and stop the pain.  Unless she has a long chunk of skin just hanging off you might be able to get away with just using the wash.

Though the main issue with stevia is less the actual stevia and more the manufacturer. Most manufacturers use bulking agents to make stevia look and feel like sugar. Well like all other sweeteners those bulking agents tend to be made of some form of sugar.   common bulking agents: cane sugar, erythritol, dextrose, isomaltulose, maltodextrine, cellulose powder and inulin soluble fiber.   Now legally they have to call any stevia product with these bulking agents in them a ""Stevia Sweetener"". What you would really want to buy to avoid this is ""Pure Stevia Extract"" as these are not legally allowed to have bulking agents.   See this is the reason why I just discarded all of these sweeteners it just gets too complicated.   Sorry if I confused anyone.

As a software developer, I have the means to buy a new mac every 6 months if I so desired. I don't. That would be frivolous. I save money and only spend when it's worth it.[1]  I buy new mac laptops every two years. I'm still using my iPad 1 that I purchased after several months of saving in college. (No regrets, I used the hell out of that thing) I probably won't buy another 10"" iPad for another year or two if at all. I just don't have a pressing need. I will preorder the iPad Mini when Apple gets around to releasing it. The mini is small enough use at a coffee shop. The full size model is just too large.   I have an iPhone but I didn't purchase it until I had the money and Apple released a model that could replace my point and shoot camera. I do buy a new sub-$100 ereader every time B&amp;N or Amazon comes out with a new model but these double as gifts. (Hello Whitepaper!) When I'm done playing with my new purchase, I give away the ereader I don't want to a friend.   So that said...  I have a Macbook Pro with Retina Display™. It's the most amazing machine I ever owned. It's replace all 3 computers I had when I purchased it. I can finally have a triple monitor setup on my mac. God, I love this machine. It's replaced all of the other computer hardware in my apartment. It makes me amazingly happy.  Could I get by on a used Macbook Air? Yes. I did for a year and it sucked balls when I wanted to do more than basic development. It's well worth an extra $1000 to have a blissful experience than a shitty one where 10% of the time I'm limited by my machine.   Could I get by on a cheap netbook? Sure. I used a $700 HP laptop loaded with linux in college. It lasted 2 years before it started powering off if it was moved more than an inch or was bumped too hard. I still have it. I could use it in an emergency. It would suck and I wouldn't be able to enjoy the tight integration between my phone, ipad and laptop.  Let's put it this way,   * If you're looking for calories to keep you on your feet for the next 5 hours, McDonalds can do that for $2.   * If you're looking for a tasty and satisfying meal, you can hit the local Pho place for $8.  * If you want take your time and really enjoy lunch, you can hit up sushi for $20 and drink free green tea.  If you really like to eat fancy and you have the means, why would you spend your lunches at McDonalds?   Let me repeat, if you live to really enjoy great meals and you have more than enough time and money to enjoy them, why would you eat at McDonalds?  [1]: I do have unfortunate fetish for IKEA furniture. That is frivolous and expensive. I spent 15 minutes drooling over a chair yesterday. I purchased $200 worth of desk instead. (Built a standing desk today. I can pretend it's for my health) I'm pretty good with electronics though I almost bought 42"" TV on woot the other day. Almost. I do give myself an unlimited evening coffee budget but it's kind of hard to spend damaging amounts of money on coffee. I made my morning caffeine at home during the week. No exceptions. I eat lunch at home unless I need to socialize with coworkers. (max 2x/wk) Otherwise I would be dropping $50+ a day on coffeeshops for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. My spending is in control, barely.   Edit: I forgot. I also have a fetish for messenger bags. Total spending over 4 years is less than $400 so it's not too bad. New $300+ device usually means a new bag to go with it. Though my latest purchase was more than I really needed to spend: http://www.hazard4.com/products_ditch.html   **TL;DR**: Spending money on nice things not a waste if you can afford",™

If the reason is [bitterness from women ignoring nice-guy you over 'assholes'](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/zxqxq/women_are_people_not_puzzle_boxes/c68q462), or because [you view women as the Gatekeepers of Sex with all the power](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/zxqxq/women_are_people_not_puzzle_boxes/c68qkw6), then maybe you need to examine those attitudes first.

t5_2sfmf,blakerboy777,1347824600,"That's a good point. I guess I think of tax breaks and tax increases I fundamentally different ways. Tax increases should always be for the purpose of increasing revenue. In my mind that is the only moral purpose of a tax; otherwise it is a subtle and insidious attempt to control the economy rather than a forthright law. Tax incentives are, in my opinion, an attempt to increase revenue by increase the flow of money. Its all an attempt to find the place on the Laffer curve where revenue will be maximized. Until we get to the point where our debt is paid down and revenue exceeds spending, we will always be trying to increase revenues.   Increasing taxes in order to discourage certain types of investment is an aspect of central planning. Tax breaks can be used in the same way, and I don't think that's any more defensible. I would rather see the FairTax© passed and not have the government have the kind of influence it has on our economy. I think the housing bubble is an example of how this fails. The government tried to incentivise (sic) homeownership, which led to the financial crisis at the end of Bush's presidency. If the government concerned itself primarily with fairly aggregating revenue rather than using every source of revenue as a chance to pick winners and losers, I think our government would be in a lot better shape.

t5_2fwo,rwbarton,1347837303,"&gt; You're the one with the old ghc, this is 7.4, which started using unicode for FilePath.  Oh, I see.  Actually 7.0.4 only got this right by accident; it is effectively reading the filename as latin1 and printing it as UTF-8.  If I create a file with a UTF-8 encoded name, I get `balderdashÃ©`.  7.4 assumes filenames are UTF-8 and translates the invalid trailing `e9` byte as U+DCE9, which it then can't print out because it's not a Unicode character.  But I can pass the String with this weird character from getDirectoryContents back to writeFile and that works fine.  Your program is trying to print a non-Unicode string (the name of the file) to a Unicode terminal, so it fails.  When the filename really is UTF-8, 7.4 does the right thing.  Edit: Oh I see from your comments elsewhere you already know how GHC works in this area.  It is pretty awkward to have an interface that pretends filenames are UTF-8 on a system where are semantically just strings of bytes.  &gt; Also you didn't create the same filename, it's supposed to be invalid utf-8:  I used the same command to create it.  You can see the output of my ls command is not valid UTF-8; it contains e9 followed by 0a.  Whereas yours contains only ASCII characters... I guess your version of ls prints an escape sequence in this situation.",©

I heard a scuffling noise; I turned to look, and I saw a pair of beady little eyes staring up at me in both surprise and menace. Since that time, I've heard creatures scampering behind the walls of my house and seen birds fly in and out of my attic.   So hey, it's not an entirely crazy notion.",®

I do realize a 670 is twice as good as a 660 (at least I've read that somewhere), so that's a clear improvement.  My questions are simple, will a 3770K have any benefits over a 3570k with my current parts (with 670 or not) and what are the benefits of a 670? Isn't 660 good enough?

t5_2se72,cokefriend,1347841008,"Project 46 - With Monstercat for a while now and one of the only House music producers. Check out everything they make. Now. Only thing about them that is sad is that they didn't make their title 'Jacking Off in Public' despite me getting 300 votes for it. Hasselhoff is good too though!  Rezonate - First seen in 004, holy shit, I LOVED PUMP IT! Really good Electro song that is #2 on my list compared to the irreplaceable Bad Pitched in my heart. His next song, Lights is fucking amazing, I love how it builds up from very subtle notes and a quiet melody progressing into this kick ass electro beat. 008's Revolt with Amelia Rose, like TwoThird's 007 Waking Dreams, was a very relaxing song with female vocals (which I fucking adore) and as an added bonus, came with a great dubstep part in the middle.  Rogue - Newer addition to Monstercat. I believe he's a friend of Tristam's. Sounded very skrillexy with his first track in 006, This is it, but was ok nonetheless. Daybreak and Dynamite in 008 made his skrilly sound (the vocal manipulation yet again) a signature sound like Insan3Lik3. It is evident again in Nightfall. Overall, if you don't like that vocal manipulation shit, don't listen to him, but his stuff's pretty tight.  Rundfunk - New to the family, song in 009 was amazing nu disco. At this rate, Monstercat needs a new colour for this genre haha. Can't just be classified as EDM anymore :P  Skifonix - Only heard in 008. Their song, People Say is an energetic electro song which was actually mixed extremely well into the album mix. Once again, female vocals ♥_♥.  Soulero - Didn't listen to his song Pussycat in depth enough to have an opinion on it, but from a first hear, it sounds good, check it out.  Stephen Walking - Original member of Monstercat. I loved his song Still Walking in 001 for the intro prior to the drop due to its subbass and subtlety, but his songs from 002 - 006 really didn't interest me. His drumstep afterwards kind of got me back into him, but overall, I don't like his style. It's all opinions here, maybe you'll love him. Check him out regardless of my opinion.",♥

t5_2qi6d,adroc,1347849406,"Works fine for me. But here it is if you cant read it.  Jon Yates' ""What's Your Problem?"" September 16, 2012  Parking along the 0-100 block of West Randolph Street isn't cheap.  From 8 a.m. to 9 p.m., it costs $5.75 an hour; overnight parking costs about half that amount.  At those rates, parking along the street for 24 hours would set you back a hefty $106.38.  For months, the 26-year-old has been parking her motorcycle in what you might call Loop loopholes — small patches of downtown streets that are neither covered by the seemingly omnipresent meters nor marked as restricted.  In other words, Targos has found slivers of space where she can legally park her 1996 Honda VT 600 for free.  The free spots are widely known by fellow motorcycle riders who park in them daily, Targos said. Some of the spots, like the ones on Randolph, are large enough to fit a car.  In most cases the city does not bat an eye.  But for reasons she can't fathom, Chicago police have begun aggressively ticketing her motorcycle when she parks it along West Randolph.  Since June 3, Targos has received 38 parking tickets for a variety of alleged infractions, including parking ""not entirely in a parking meter space,"" parking in a prohibited zone, and having an expired meter in the central business district.  Targos insists the tickets are bogus, and has challenged all 38 by mail.  So far, administrative law judges agree.  Through Friday, 14 of the tickets have been adjudicated, and Targos maintains a perfect record — all 14 were dismissed.  Rulings on the other 24 tickets are pending, but Targos expects those to be thrown out too.  ""I've read the ordinance. I know the ordinance so freaking well,"" she said. ""Not one (of the tickets) has been found valid by an administrative judge.""  And yet, the citations keep coming.  In an attempt to stop the tickets, Targos has taped copies of the judges' rulings on her motorcycle, hoping officers will read it and see that she is legally parked. Instead, officers continue to write fresh tickets, affixing them to her rearview mirror.  At times, the situation has gotten testy.  In early September, Targos was parking her motorcycle when two officers approached and said she couldn't park there, she said. Targos showed them copies of the judges' rulings, but the conversation quickly devolved, she said.  ""They were saying, 'You have to pay to park, you have to pay to park,'"" Targos said. ""I kept saying, 'According to these signs, I don't.'"" Targos said she walked away to avoid further confrontation. ""I got two tickets that day.""  She emailed What's Your Problem? Sept. 6, after receiving three tickets within 24 hours.  ""I keep parking there on principle because I don't want the officers to bully me out of parking in a legal spot,"" she said.  Targos, who lives in the Loop, said she called her alderman, Brendan Reilly, 42nd, whose office instructed her to file a complaint with the Independent Police Review Authority. She eventually filed two complaints, but they did not stop the flow of tickets.  The Problem Solver met Targos on West Randolph Street, and she gave a tour of the block and the signage. Initially, she said, she parked on the south side of Randolph near Dearborn Street, along a stretch that is not covered by any parking restrictions. A sign about 50 feet east of Dearborn says ""pay for parking at pay box"" with an arrow pointing east. There are no signs restricting parking west of the sign, where she parked.  After she started receiving tickets at that location, she began parking on the east end of that block, in a smaller stretch of similarly unmarked curb space. The tickets continued there as well.  Targos said that elsewhere in the Loop, the city has prohibited free parking by adding a second sign to each signpost saying parking is prohibited in the unmetered stretches. In fact, such a sign is posted on the north side of Randolph, directly across the street.  But without any signs indicating parking is restricted or metered, Targos says she is breaking no law.  ""If you walk around downtown, you'll see there are secret little motorcycle spots all over the place,"" she said. ""If they do move those signs, that's fine. There are plenty of other places.""  Targos said she wants the remaining 24 tickets dismissed and for officers to stop issuing new ones.  The Problem Solver called the Police Department and the city's Department of Revenue.  A Revenue Department spokeswoman referred questions to police. Police spokeswoman Melissa Stratton said the department visited the area where Targos has been parking and toured the business district.  ""It's a larger issue in general,"" Stratton said. ""It's not a cut-and-dried thing.""  She said officers are doing the best they can to enforce parking ordinances and signs.  ""We're looking into it to get a better sense of the issue that exists,"" Stratton said.  She said she could not comment on the complaints Targos filed with the Independent Police Review Authority, citing the ongoing investigation.  Targos called the police department's response disappointing.  ""I wonder how many other people are out there getting frivolous tickets?"" she said. ""I have shown these officers personally that these are wrong, but they keep issuing the tickets. Are there no consequences?""  Targos said she will continue to park in the ""free"" spots and plans to challenge tickets she receives.  ""If it's an illegal spot then mark it properly,"" she said.  facebook.com/chitribproblem  Twitter @wyp_tribune  Copyright © 2012, Chicago Tribune",©

Either way, that glosses over quite a lot and doesn't tell us much about how we should structure our taxes. You should be able to change the tax structure quite a bit while remaining revenue neutral.  I'm talking about purpose. If your purpose is to control the economy, even if the side effect is increased revenue, its a bad law, IMHO. We don't need central planning, democracy is all about the decentralization of power.   &gt;&gt; Increasing taxes in order to discourage certain types of investment is an aspect of central planning. Tax breaks can be used in the same way, and I don't think that's any more defensible. I would rather see the FairTax© passed...  &gt;It's still basically ""central planning"". You're just discouraging purchases and possibly investment, and probably encouraging money hoarding. Not that I'm dismissing the idea, but it still influences the economy. You're not going to see a tax plan that doesn't influence the economy.  It does influence the economy, but it doesn't specifically favor one party over another. It treats everyone equally. If no one is ever given a tax holiday, then hoarding is pointless. What's the point in being rich if you never spend your money? Its revenue neutral, so no particular party should experience an increased tax burden. Its not like they'll be poorer if they spend their money now than before, they just get taxed when they spend their money rather than before.    So there's no intent to drive economic policy, your just taking less control. If you don't think the state should have control over life and death, you wouldn't see the end of capital punishment to be bad. Yes, they are making a decision over life and death, but the decision is to step away from making those kinds if decisions. The FairTax is that kind of economic policy.

t5_2u06v,Rantzy,1347885309,"**UPDATE: Called a Crisis line last night.** I was really feeling the urge to self-harm. The pain inside was so intense and blindsiding. I am beginning to wonder if this deep and sudden depression is a side-effect of the new medication. Nothing I do seems to help me cope. I took a two-hour walk yesterday and I still had a break down in the late afternoon. I love my son, I really do. He deserves a mom who doesn't hurt inside like this for no apparent reason.  The mobile crisis unit counselors are coming to talk to me this morning. I refused to go to the hospital or anywhere without my baby. So she said this would be a good option. I'm a little nervous... I hope they aren't going to try to commit me or anything... I just need to know what to do to lessen the *intensity* of these raw emotions so I can manage. My psychiatrist put me into serotonin syndrome and this is the third thing he's done that Ihave considered incompetent or not-quite-ethical so I saw a specialist who told me how to titrate my medication properly. But now I'm at a loss. I call my psychiatrist (privately to myself) Dr. Buttnugget. I don't want to go back to Dr. Buttnugget after the serotonin syndrome episode... and I'm on the waitlist for someone new (program with psychiatrist and psychologist combined). Everything is just ... ""hurry up and wait."" Later today is Baby and Mommy fitness class... but it's going to be a hard push for me to even go today...  Unfortunately, my close family and friends live 17 hours away. My husband's family is very ... analytical or logical in their approach to things. If it doesn't make sense, they don't understand. If there is no reason to feel this bad, then I should just be capable of using willpower to free myself or I should get my medications fixed and then all will be fine. It's like they ignore the feelings entirely, as if they're just a symptom to be considered, analyzed, labeled, and shelved. They don't understand how *consuming* the feelings can be, how they are like rapids that drag at you constantly and try relentlessly to pull you under. Feelings make his family uncomfortable.  Thank you all for your supportive words, by the way. I can't tell you how much it means to me to have people who understand, people who simply care across the miles about a stranger, it chokes me up. ♥ I don't feel worthy of it but I do know how lucky it makes me not to have to ride this out completely alone.",♥
t5_2qh2t,johnnychase,1347885369,"Approx 20 seconds.  &gt; &gt;Jon Yates' ""What's Your Problem?"" September 16, 2012 &gt; &gt;Parking along the 0-100 block of West Randolph Street isn't cheap. &gt;From 8 a.m. to 9 p.m., it costs $5.75 an hour; overnight parking costs about half that amount. &gt; &gt;At those rates, parking along the street for 24 hours would set you back a hefty $106.38. &gt; &gt;For months, the 26-year-old has been parking her motorcycle in what you might call Loop loopholes — small patches of downtown streets that are neither covered by the seemingly omnipresent meters nor marked as restricted. &gt; &gt;In other words, Targos has found slivers of space where she can legally park her 1996 Honda VT 600 for free. &gt; &gt;The free spots are widely known by fellow motorcycle riders who park in them daily, Targos said. Some of the spots, like the ones on Randolph, are large enough to fit a car. &gt; &gt;In most cases the city does not bat an eye. &gt; &gt;But for reasons she can't fathom, Chicago police have begun aggressively ticketing her motorcycle when she parks it along West Randolph. &gt; &gt;Since June 3, Targos has received 38 parking tickets for a variety of alleged infractions, including parking ""not entirely in a parking meter space,"" parking in a prohibited zone, and having an expired meter in the central business district. &gt; &gt;Targos insists the tickets are bogus, and has challenged all 38 by mail. &gt;So far, administrative law judges agree. &gt; &gt;Through Friday, 14 of the tickets have been adjudicated, and Targos maintains a perfect record — all 14 were dismissed. &gt; &gt;Rulings on the other 24 tickets are pending, but Targos expects those to be thrown out too. &gt; &gt;""I've read the ordinance. I know the ordinance so freaking well,"" she said. ""Not one (of the tickets) has been found valid by an administrative judge."" &gt; &gt;And yet, the citations keep coming. &gt; &gt;In an attempt to stop the tickets, Targos has taped copies of the judges' rulings on her motorcycle, hoping officers will read it and see that she is legally parked. Instead, officers continue to write fresh tickets, affixing them to her rearview mirror. &gt; &gt;At times, the situation has gotten testy. &gt; &gt;In early September, Targos was parking her motorcycle when two officers approached and said she couldn't park there, she said. Targos showed them copies of the judges' rulings, but the conversation quickly devolved, she said. &gt; &gt;""They were saying, 'You have to pay to park, you have to pay to park,'"" Targos said. ""I kept saying, 'According to these signs, I don't.'"" Targos said she walked away to avoid further confrontation. ""I got two tickets that day."" &gt; &gt;She emailed What's Your Problem? Sept. 6, after receiving three tickets within 24 hours. &gt; &gt;""I keep parking there on principle because I don't want the officers to bully me out of parking in a legal spot,"" she said. &gt; &gt;Targos, who lives in the Loop, said she called her alderman, Brendan Reilly, 42nd, whose office instructed her to file a complaint with the Independent Police Review Authority. She eventually filed two complaints, but they did not stop the flow of tickets. &gt; &gt;The Problem Solver met Targos on West Randolph Street, and she gave a tour of the block and the signage. Initially, she said, she parked on the south side of Randolph near Dearborn Street, along a stretch that is not covered by any parking restrictions. A sign about 50 feet east of Dearborn says ""pay for parking at pay box"" with an arrow pointing east. There are no signs restricting parking west of the sign, where she parked. &gt; &gt;After she started receiving tickets at that location, she began parking on the east end of that block, in a smaller stretch of similarly unmarked curb space. The tickets continued there as well. &gt; &gt;Targos said that elsewhere in the Loop, the city has prohibited free parking by adding a second sign to each signpost saying parking is prohibited in the unmetered stretches. In fact, such a sign is posted on the north side of Randolph, directly across the street. &gt; &gt;But without any signs indicating parking is restricted or metered, Targos says she is breaking no law. &gt; &gt;""If you walk around downtown, you'll see there are secret little motorcycle spots all over the place,"" she said. ""If they do move those signs, that's fine. There are plenty of other places."" &gt; &gt;Targos said she wants the remaining 24 tickets dismissed and for officers to stop issuing new ones. &gt; &gt;The Problem Solver called the Police Department and the city's Department of Revenue. &gt; &gt;A Revenue Department spokeswoman referred questions to police. Police spokeswoman Melissa Stratton said the department visited the area where Targos has been parking and toured the business district. &gt;""It's a larger issue in general,"" Stratton said. ""It's not a cut-and-dried thing."" &gt; &gt;She said officers are doing the best they can to enforce parking ordinances and signs. &gt; &gt;""We're looking into it to get a better sense of the issue that exists,"" Stratton said. &gt; &gt;She said she could not comment on the complaints Targos filed with the Independent Police Review Authority, citing the ongoing investigation. &gt;Targos called the police department's response disappointing. &gt;""I wonder how many other people are out there getting frivolous tickets?"" she said. ""I have shown these officers personally that these are wrong, but they keep issuing the tickets. Are there no consequences?"" &gt; &gt;Targos said she will continue to park in the ""free"" spots and plans to challenge tickets she receives. &gt; &gt;""If it's an illegal spot then mark it properly,"" she said. &gt; &gt;facebook.com/chitribproblem &gt; &gt;Twitter @wyp_tribune &gt; &gt;Copyright © 2012, Chicago Tribune",©
t5_2qj8f,p1dbull,1347885426,"&gt; Caveat: ""Invincible Germany,"" in the context of the presentation being made, means to have a Germany with a sufficiently highly developed state of consciousness that its people will radiate such goodness and light to the universe that everyone will want to be their friends, thereby ensuring that Germany will have no enemies, thereby ensuring that Germany is invincible.  This context wasn't given in this presentation at all, the Raja thought it was a good idea to march into this forum and let people chant ""Invincible Germany"" like it was a Nuremberg Rally of the Nazi Party. The highest ranking TM functionary of Germany was lucky that his listeners remained so calm and German law enforcement didn't take him seriously, because he was obviously just a loon with a funny hat, or they would have thrown his ass into jail.  &gt; [whether or not Germany will become invincible via the strategy proposed by David Lynch and the German ""raja"" is another discussion altogether]  You mean building a penis shaped university on the Devil's mountain in Berlin and station ""flying"" (more like jumping a few centimeters, really) Yogis in it, isn't a reasonable idea to achieve political solutions for Germany? But that's more or less the central idea behind the political and religious movement of Transcendental Meditation®, and crazy does only begin to describe it.

t5_2qhwp,ahnold11,1347886257,"This mod (more of an ""unlock"" really) is not as cut and dry as the title implies.  It has issues, (eg. sliding down a ladder causes you to fall off the map).  There are many parts of the game where shortcuts were made that will probably not play nice with this small/simple change. There will likely be many glitches that pop up when using this, the types of things the developers probably are aware of (ie ""all the problems unlocking the framerate might cause""), which is why they didn't ship this with the game.  A fair criticism is that they should have spent the time and money to do it ""proper"" or otherwise not have bothered to put it the game on the PC in this first place.  But this port is specifically at the request of fans who knew that going in. They didn't want to make it, weren't confident in making it, and likely didn't have the budget to make it. It was full disclosure on this one.  The choice has always been, Dark Souls on PC Warts and All®, or no Dark Souls on PC at all.

Where did that go wrong? Was it the dropped passes and the line's failure to give the running game a chance? I don't know. They were fighting I would say despite an OBVIOUS lack of any  (offense) momentum.  Then somewhere they just collectively couldn't match the intensity. The Seahawks beat them up and maintained pressure and the Cowboys never matched it. After a certain point they faded and the Seahawks kept driving. The result is a one-sided beatdown.  I'm wondering, was this a 'perfect storm' kind of thing with the ST miscues and the hostile environment (plus I do believe Seattle is a stronger team than people give credit) plus the unusually bad play from guys like Witten or is this just a paper tiger team again. All these RKG™ that are ex team captains in college etc but noone with the balls to back up Lee after that obvious cheap shot. Fuck the penalty that should have cleared the sideline. That's your defensive centerpiece and leader. Yet tate's out there being a douchebag and noone does shit.

t5_2r4b9,Troxle,1347904693,"I feel fully transition and really only came to the conclusion yesterday while at work (MtF).  I used to hang out with all boys and play boy things in school, all but my first few years (I played house with a girl and it is some of my best memories thinkin' back on it!), but I would play tag and we had a game called ""The Muck Monster"" where a friend in a higher grade would just chase us around pretendin' to be a monster.  Even doin' all this, I still wished to do stuff like paint my nails and grow my hair, and when I asked my mom, she gently put me down ""Boys don't do those things.""  So I sucked it up and went on bein' a boy.  In middle school me and my best friend ended up hookin' up (both of us male ""at the time"") and we were practically inseparable, but no one knew we were datin'.  I ended up findin' skirts in the spare bedroom's closet and we used to roleplay with them a lot and it felt so comfortin'.  But we eventually went out ways and lost contact, but I didn't shed a tear, ""I was a man. Men don't cry.""  I never really touched the skirts again save for maybe once or twice, too many bad memories...  Do you think I view myself as not a woman growin' up because I did what men are supposed to do?  Suck it up and not cry and deal with it?  No!  Fuck, I've learned to cry into a pillow at night thinkin' of how much life sucked havin' to be a man (this was in recent years), but I always woke up the next day and sucked it up.  I've always just wished for a magic spell or button to change my gender so that I wouldn't have to just suck it up and be a man.  I want to be a woman, its me damnit!  Just cause you cry doesn't mean you aren't a man. Ask yourself:  &gt; What makes you happy?  &gt; Can you see yourself as a woman years down the road?  &gt; Can you see yourself as a man years down the road?  Hormones suck, even if you don't feel in the right body, your gender is all wrong, the hormones keep comin' and they act against what you really feel.  You need to realize this first, so your tears might just be an extension of your body pumpin' out the wrong hormones, and even still, I've seen ""real men"" break down and cry.  I hope you figure everythin' out for yourself!  You do NOT have to have a label for who you are.  A label only helps describe who you are to other people in the easiest fashion possible.  Just be yourself and do what feels right!  **TL;DR: I always acted as a ""boy"" growin' up (for the most part) and did ""boy"" things, but I don't feel right continuin' to be a man.  I know the feelin', just be yourself and do what YOU are comfortable with, don't let labels get you down!**  ♥♥♥",♥

t5_2ssp3,Ernest_Frawde,1347907564,"[Léo Taxil](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LÃ©o_Taxil) was the pen name of a French writer known for the [Taxil Hoax](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxil_hoax). Born in 1854, he spent part of his childhood in a Jesuit school and developed a strong dislike of Christianity. He grew up to become an author and journalist and focused mostly on writing anti-clerical and anti-Catholic books and articles. He became somewhat infamous and in 1879 was tried for insulting a state recognized religion.  Yet in 1886 he declared his conversion to Catholicism and began publishing supposed histories of Freemasonry which mostly amounted to conspiracy theories. Taxil's denunciations of Freemasonry became popular reading among French Catholics. He published a series of books and a newspaper on the subject. This culminated with the book *Le Diable au XIXè siècle* which contained the confessions of Diana Vaughn, a ""High Priestess of Lucifer"". At the peak of his popularity he was called to attend an audience with Pope Leo XIII who was incensed about the Bishop of Charleston's denunciation of anti-Masonic propaganda and wanted to consult with Taxil, who was by now regarded as the Catholic specialist on Freemasons.   By then however, journalists had been investigating Taxil's anti-Masonic claims and had been seeking out Diana Vaughn. Taxil announced that he would hold a lecture where he would present the high-priestess. The lecture was held and instead of presenting her to the crowd Taxil explained that she had never existed and that his conversion and anti-Masonic writing were hoaxes intended to highlight the church's fanaticism. He also described previous hoaxes he had perpetrated. One was about an underwater city in Lake Geneva which attracted archaeologists and tourists for several years. He had also convinced the authorities of Marseille that the harbour was full of sharks, creating a panic and forcing the authorities to send boats out to hunt these sharks.  I can't remember where I read about him, but he was a fascinating character and unfortunately the Wikipedia article about him doesn't go into great detail. If I recall correctly even his anti-clericalism was somehow dubious. It would be great if someone could elaborate on his story. Especially the underwater city and shark stories.",©

t5_2tx47,mnemyx,1347918184,":(  I send you my best regards and wishes ♥  I hope you find someone (or something) that'll make your heart a little lighter, be it a pet, hobby, or a new person.  Most, if not all, of my ex's have cheated on me and have made me cry on my birthdays.  The last one was particularly bad - our relationship was a ticking time bomb (I've posted about it before).  And had he not cheated on me and broken me down, I wouldn't be who I am today.  The experience of being in an abusive relationship helped me realize all the things we were doing wrong, not that I think this is a good experience for anyone.  No one should have to go through that, but in my case, it was a lesson learned.  But it's the reason I'm now in a better relationship with someone new for the past year and a half.  He's been wonderful and sweet.  He's my best friend, and he's also the one that's helped me regain the self-confidence and trust for others which I lost during my last relationship.     His family has also become the family that I've never had.  I'm estranged from my real family for many reasons...so it's nice to feel like I belong somewhere.  They've provided me with the stability I didn't think could be possible in life.  And honestly, it's because of them that makes life worth experiencing.  I really hope to be there for them as they've been there for me.  And the funny story of how my SO and I met.  We met on OKC (I know, I know).  He recognized my new account (my ex deleted my old one while we were dating) and decided to message me about how we were in the same major, at the same college, and had almost the same group of friends.  What I didn't know then was he had also messaged my old account (never saw that message...it would've been about a year to two years ago from the time we first met and right around when I first met my ex) from his old account.  Apparently he had deleted his old account, and then decided to make a new one again.  He had really wanted to meet me then, so when he recognized my new account, he was really hoping I'd respond.  And I did; we met for bubble tea; and he's been around since then.  Things work out in weird ways.",♥

First, to declare genetic modification as ""bad"" and in need of a broad GM label is as much the approach of the Luddite as those who saw sparks around Tesla and declared electricity bad.

Consumers will need to learn about these different genes, but that only helps the public. There will of course be PR wars about a given gene - but that is a far more reasonable and socially defensible position than PR wars about 'genetics'.  There is no reasonable reason to prevent the addition to agricultural plants of genes which synthesize vitamins that a human needs, but which were not evolutionarily advantageous to the original plant.  There are financial interests which compete for the less obvious cases - and these should be heard out in the court of public/consumer opinion.  In California there is a ballot initiative to label foods as 'GM' or not.  This, like much of California's bureaucracy, will backfire - good intentions implemented so emotionally as to lack a practical and factual founding.  The solution is not a knee-jerk reaction, but an education.  tasteslikesnozberry gives a good look at a seldom-heard side of the food debate - but in a larger context it is that information which needs to come out.

That particular denomination is the Roman Catholic church. In addition, encyclicals like *Redemptoris Missio* are very friendly to the theology of universal salvation (i.e. everyone goes to heaven), and Pope John Paul II was noted for his benevolence toward the concept.  So while it's a very easy and comfortable claim to make that all Christians believe that you must accept Jesus as Your Personal Lord and Savior™ or else you get a one-way ticket to Brimstone Resorts for the next eternity, it's not a *correct* one. It is quite possibly the case that *most* Christians do not believe that doctrine; it is for a fact not the official doctrine of the single largest denomination of Christianity, and Orthodoxy tends to have equally nuanced views of soteriology.

Here is some information on breathing (from yoga) This is **LONG** and the formatting might be kinda messy (just copy and pasted from a document)  --------------------  Types of Breathing Techniques - Student Handout  Below are several of the most commonly used forms of pranayama.  **Ujjayi Pranayama**  *The victory or ocean sounding breath*  Benefits:  ♥ Focuses the mind  ♥ Increases mindfulness  ♥ Generates internal heat  ♥ Grounding  ♥ Aids in concentration  Ujjayi Pranayama is called the ocean sounding breath, and somewhat irreverently as the ""Darth Vader"" breath, because you make an ocean sound by contracting the glottis with the inhalation and exhalation. This Pranayama is done through the nose, but it is helpful to begin practicing breathing through the mouth. To make the ocean sound, whisper the syllable ""h,"" feeling the contraction in your throat. Keep this contraction engaged on the inhalation and exhalation. After a couple of breaths try to close the mouth, breathing through the nose while still making the ocean sound in your throat.  **How to do it**  1. Come into a comfortable seated position with your spine erect, or lie down on your back. Visualize lifting you belly towards your chin and begin by taking long, slow, and deep breaths through the nostrils.  2. Allow the breath to be gentle and relaxed as you lower the tongue and open the back of the throat creating a steady ""Darth Vader"" sound as you breathe in and out. The sound need not be forced, but it should be loud enough so that if someone came close to you they would hear it.  3. Lengthen the inhalation and the exhalation as much as possible without creating tension anywhere in your body, and allow the sound of the breath to be continuous and smooth.  4. To help create the proper ""ah"" sound, hold your hand up to your mouth and exhale as if trying to fog a mirror. Inhale the same way. Notice how you opent the back of the throat to create the fog effect. Now close your mouth and do the same thing while breathing through the nose.  **When to do it**  During asana practice; Before meditation; Anytime you want to concentrate  ---------------  **Dirga Pranayama**  *The 3 part breath or complete breath*  Benefits  ♥ Calming and relaxing  ♥ Promotes proper diaphragmatic breathing, relaxes the mind and body, oxygenates the blood and purges the lungs of residual carbon dioxide.  Dirga Pranayama is called the three part breath because you are actively breathing into three parts of your abdomen, the three chambers of the lungs. The first position is the low belly (on top of or just below the belly button), the second position is the low chest (lower half of the rib cage), and the third position is the low throat (just above the top of the sternum). The breath is continuous, inhaled and exhaled through of the nose. The inhalation starts in the first position, the low belly; then moves to the second position, the low chest; then to the third position, the low throat. The exhalation starts in the low throat, moves to the low chest, and finishes in the low belly. Rest your hands on the individual positions to feel the breath rising and falling through each position. When you start practicing, you may want to individually isolate the movement in each position, using the hands. When you have a good feel for the breath moving in and out of each position, practice without the hands. Eventually relax the effort of the Pranayama and breathe into the three positions gently, feeling a wave of breath move up and down the torso.  **How to do it**  Sit with your spine erect, or lie down on your back. Begin taking long, slow, and deep breaths through the nostrils.  1. As you inhale, allow the belly to fill with air, drawing air deep into the lower lungs. As you exhale, allow the belly to deflate like a balloon. Repeat several times, keeping the breath smooth and relaxed, and never straining. Repeat several times.  2. Breathe into your belly as in Step #1, but also expand the mid-chest region by allowing the rib cage to open outward to the sides. Exhale and repeat several times.  3. Follow steps #1 and #2 and continue inhaling by opening the clavicular region or upper chest. Exhale and repeat.   Combine all three steps into one continuous or complete flow.  **When to do it**  During asana practice; Prior to meditation; Prior to relaxation; Anytime you feel like it  ---------------  **Nadi Sodhana Pranayama**  *Alternate nostril breathing or sweet breath.*  Benefits  ♥ Calms the mind,relaxing  ♥ Soothes anxiety and stress  ♥ Balances left and right hemispheres, promotes clear thinking.  It is simple form of alternate nostril breathing suitable for beginning and advanced students. Nadi means channel and refers to the energy pathways through which prana flows. Shodhana means cleansing -- so Nadi Shodhana means channel cleaning.  **How to do it**  1. Hold your right hand up and curl your index and middle fingers toward your palm. Place your thumb next to your right nostril and your ring finger and pinky by your left. Close the left nostril by pressing gently against it with your ring finger and pinky, and inhale through the right nostril. The breath should be slow, steady and full.  2. Now close the right nostril by pressing gently against it with your thumb, and open your left nostril by relaxing your ring finger and pinky and exhale fully with a slow and steady breath.  3. Inhale through the left nostril, close it, and then exhale through the right nostril. That's one complete round of Nadi Shodhana – . Continue, doing 5-20 rounds.  4. Inhale through the right nostril  5. Exhale through the left  6. Inhale through the left  7. Exhale through the right. Begin with 5-10 rounds and add more as you feel ready. Remember to keep your breathing slow, easy and full.  **When to do it**  Just about any time and any where. Try it as a mental warm-up before meditation to help calm the mind and put you in the mood. You can also do it as part of your centering before beginning an asana or posture routine. Also try it at times throughout the day. Nadi Shodhana helps control stress and anxiety. If you start to feel stressed out, 10 or so rounds will help calm you down. It also helps soothe anxiety caused by flying and other fearful or stressful situations.  ---------------  **Kabalabahti Pranayama**  *the breath of fire or the skull shining breath*  Benefits ♥ Invigorating ♥ Energizing ♥ purifying  **How to do it** Kapalabhati is a very active, forced exhalation with a passive inhalation. To exhale, the belly quickly pumps into the spine forcing the air out of the nose (like trying to blow out a candle through you nose). Place a hand on your belly to feel the belly actively pumping.  Play with the tempo (45-60 exhalations/30 seconds), but keep a steady rhythm. Start with 2-3 rounds of 30 exhalations, and gradually increase the exhalations if comfortable.  ---------------  **Sit Cari Pranayama**  *the hissing breath*  Benefits  ♥ cools the body  **How to do it**  Curl the tongue touching the roof of the mouth as far back as you can to the soft pallet. As you inhale clench the teeth together and slightly part the lips making a hissing ""ssss"" sound. Exhale through both nostrils. Repeat 5-10 times.  ---------------  **Shitali Pranayama**  *the cooling breath*  Benefits  ♥ cools the body  **How to do it**  Roll the tongue into a tube (as best as you can) and stick the tip of the tongue out of the mouth. Inhale through the tongue and hold the breath in for 4-5 seconds with the chin pressed against the chest. Exhale using Ujjayi Pranayama through the nose.   Repeat 5-10 times",♥

t5_2qh16,kraetos,1348015233,"Google isn't evil. Google is stupid.  Now, I know that Google has some of the smartest software engineers and computer scientists in the world working for them. I work in the field and theoretically have the necessary experience and education to work there, but I know my resume and my GPA don't stack up.  But I'm not saying Google is stupid with computers, because that's obviously not true. Google does amazing things with technology and is one of a small handful of companies that is actually pushing the technological frontier forward. No, Google is stupid when it comes to *business.* I feel like I've seen lemonade stands run better than Google.  I mean, honestly. What the hell were they expecting when they open-sourced Android? That everyone would play nice and abide by the rules? In the most cutthroat industry in the world, on the brink of truly ubiquitous computing, the holy grail of the industry in question?  If Google didn't want people making pirate forks of Android, *then they shouldn't have let people fork it in the first place.* Seriously, what good has come of making Android open source? Google would have been much better off from the get-go if they went with a Windows Phone-like licensing scheme, and the industry landscape would probably be identical, since all the Android headset makers are paying licensing fees anyways, they're just paying them to Microsoft. (and, soon, Apple.)  OTOH if Google had licensed Android, they would be better able to protect their partners from legal assault. They would have the control over the Android ecosystem that they've recently realized is a good idea to have, c.f. Google Play and Nexus 7. They would be in a better position to block bloatware and distribute updates. Oh, and they might also be actually *making money* on Android due to licensing fees, as opposed to losing it hand over fist like they are today.  In 2008, when it was apparent that iOS would win the day and finally wrestle control back away from the carriers, Google drops in and obliterates that with one fell swoop. And for what? The nebulous benefits of ""open"" which have yet to materialize?  Even the Chrome/Chromium situation would be better than the one they currently have. But obviously the *best* solution is the iOS one: locked down final product, but many of the critical components are open source. This way they get the benefits of open source, minimal as they are, but without the considerable drawbacks that Google is now experiencing first hand.  And when (not if) Samsung throws in the towel on Android and switches a version of bada with the ability to run Android apps (all thanks to Open™!) then the Android brand becomes a ship without a captain as it fades into the mists of history while Samsung and Apple steal the show with bada and iOS.  Android will be remembered as one of the biggest blunders in tech history, the textbook example of what *not* to do with your software. Solid technology, noble concept, killed by it's business plan. Or, rather, lack thereof.",™

That's not really a big deal; you can do it to any political label.   Conservatism, as it was traditionally understood, meant you wanted to ""conserve"" the power of the state. Way back in the 18th century, before the Revolutionary War, to be labeled a ""conservative"" Tory was to be a loyalist to the British Crown. By contrast, liberalism, as it was then recognized, advocated a philosophy [similar to today's libertarians](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_liberalism).   But no one ever bitches about liberals and conservatives hijacking modern language, just as no one ever bitches about new uses for ""gay"" or even the word ""bitch"".

t5_2rjli,fuhry,1348030984,"As a real live Old Person™ that isn't actually that old, I still interact a lot with teenagers, and still will, for example, go off to a crowd of teenagers instead of a crowd of 30-plus adults, even though I can drink, have almost finished college, have worked in the real world, etc.  Honestly, I think teens' lives and daily goings-on are more interesting. The last thing us adults want to do after a day of work is carry on any sort of social function at all. Work leaves your brain fried. But teenagers have free time and energy to do cool stuff (see also: the time-money-energy paradox). I know a 14-year-old kid who is *almost* a better PHP coder than me (I've been writing PHP professionally for 5+ years) and rapidly approaching my level in sysadmin knowledge, simply because he does projects all the freaking time.  I know kids like him are generally regarded as the exception... but I think a lot of teens have that level of potential, and simply aren't in an environment which is intellectually stimulating enough to push them to reach it. In the mean time, they're taught by their peers to ""fit in"" by going along with whatever dumb fad is in the limelight, resulting in [kids like this dude](http://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/103xy1/trouble_being_paranoid/) who are probably super bright and talented and just haven't been given any affirmation, validation, or encouragement to break off from the mainstream and shine. In simpler words: high school is boring, uninspiring, and often a lowest-common-denominator job that has one simple goal, and that goal is to keep the graduation rates high. When I'm around kids and teens, I try to challenge them to go beyond that and go crazy on whatever it is that excites them.  I've thought about being a teacher at times, but like so many other young adults, I can't stand the thought of trying to raise a family on the wages a teacher is paid, and thus am not pursuing any teaching jobs. (Almost all engineers feel the same way, which is a big part of the reason US lags so far behind in STEM education. I could write a whole book on that topic.) Instead, I simply challenge and encourage kids whenever I get the chance and hope that a few of the seeds take root and grow.  In my experience, most teens aren't rowdy or irresponsible if they look up to someone who is a positive role model. I try to be that role model and earn respect, and typically when I do so the result is a great conversation.",™

Don't think too much, just jump on it and start sketching those few lines you just drew, turn them into something; a spaceship, a cityscape, that is the beauty of concept art. As far as software, photoshop illustrator and a Wacom tablet will make your sketches into digital form but you have to master sketching first.

Typically sold in Europe, the US, Canada and Australia. &gt;And as GUINNESS® Draught Extra Cold - available in keg. This is exactly the same as GUINNESS® Draught, but served a few degrees cooler. &gt;GUINNESS® Extra Stout/Original - available in bottles and cans. &gt;GUINNESS® Foreign Extra Stout - stronger in taste and more bitter than GUINNESS® Draught. It is especially popular in Asia, Africa and the Caribbean. &gt; &gt;These beers are all made with the highest quality natural ingredients, all brewed using the same unique and expert GUINNESS® brewing techniques.

And my friend is not familiar with reddit at all (too bad for him! :D). He's quite new to the game, but I've been playing for about a month. Since we are tired of all the fudging hackers out there, we figured we should try this out as our friends (who already play at Banana) ""OnOff"" and ""Jocke"" mentioned your server last night, and told us we should apply.  Also the fact that you run a private hive makes this interesting, since we won't experience any server-hoopers and hopefully not much of hacked in weapons.  An extra plus would be that the server is swedish, the same as us!

t5_2s580,Fogge,1348088627,"There are too many factors affecting which team wins, most of which are out of your control. I will always call SS, try to call plays, try to tell the team what my analysis of the situation is (""We should do X before Y"" or ""X doesn't seem to be farming super well, so maybe we should try and get ganks on Y instead""), basically keep talking in the team chat regardless if people seem to be paying attention or not cause it's a good habit to maintain. I will try to set up ganks, lasthit, farm, and buy appropriate items.  Because why? I can't stop the Lycan who has 100% ward coverage but doesn't look at the minimap getting picked off time and time again. I can't stop the 3/13/2 Pudge that probably watched a Youtube montage of sick hooks and wanted to recreate it. I can't stop the Ursa/Clinkz/Doombringer/Venomancer (who is looking to be farming) lineups, and nothing I pick can compliment that. These people do not deserve me giving up a lot of Fun™ buying wards and support items so that they MAYBE will farm enough to be relevant, so I'll just pick something, use the time to try practising last hitting and laning for the first 15 minutes and then slowly lose the game for another 30 (most games I play are thoroughly decided at the 30 minute mark, but the winning team normally can't close out before 45). I don't mind being the hard support ward bitch, but I will do it for people who appreciate it and are able to take advantage of me foregoing items to get wards up. It means nothing if you never leave the mid lane to take a rune and try to gank.  Hell, I had a game as Sniper where I was 150 GPM at fifteen minutes basically AFK farming cause I was convinced the game was lost (all our outer towers are down, kill score ""only"" 5-12 though), ended up at 370 GPM and a win. I can make a difference, but it was on the piggyback of the other team committing so many mistakes I could capitalize on. Normally that does not happen. Normally when a team is contesting high ground they don't chill right below the stairs and let me pick them off, one by one... :)",™

I imagine they are just trying to enjoy a game and relax, not thinking about being politically correct. Do you really want them to get quiet and stop having fun, or do you want them to understand why their behavior should change? If you try asking them why they would say such a thing, as if you are genuinely interested, and then try to show them how you view the situation, they might be more receptive to your view. It seems like you are asking them to understand your viewpoint, but refuse to understand theirs. I could be completely wrong here, but I would assume, they just want to have fun, and not hear a lecture. By this I mean, they are hearing you, but not listening to your message. Does this sound like it makes sense with the reaction you usually get from others?  &gt; and that needs to change and become the norm in our dysfunctional society.  Maybe you are right, but you need to make sure your words have an impact or else it is just wasted effort.

t5_2sbem,saltlakedave,1348161434,"I found out about this and did it on my PS3 a few months back. Made a *huge* difference! Do want to mention I play on a 24"" computer monitor (HDMI cable as well).    Here is something a lot of people need to be aware of though... Full RGB is going to make the dark areas of a map really dark unless your tv/monitor can be set properly to display Full RGB. My monitor can be individually adjusted or put on pre-sets for display adjustments. When in *gaming* mode I have excellent picture quality with Full RGB and can see into the darkest areas of maps easily.  However, when I take my PS3 to my brother in laws and play on his aging 50 some odd inch LCD, Full RGB makes the blacks and greys mix leaving dark parts of maps less detailed or washed out in black because we can't get the TV properly display Full RGB.    Easiest way I found out to tell if Full RGB is displaying properly is to use the standard PS3 slim theme (don't know if earlier models had a different theme) and set the color to the dark blue option. Do you notice a blackening of the bottom left corner when in Full RGB vs Limited? It should still be shades of Blue in the bottom left corner with no black or blackening if your tv/monitor is displaying it correctly.    Anyhow, as to the OP, if your TV has a gaming preset, I'd use that as it probably negates any TV post processing going on which *should* give you the best quality.    **Edit: Found the below in your manual. Unsure if this negates post processing and gives you the truest Full RGB picture, but should give it a try:**    Game Mode (Off / On): When you have connected a game console such as a PlayStation™ or Xbox™ to the TV, you can enjoy a more realistic gaming experience if you set Game Mode on. Precautions and limitations for Game Mode   – Before disconnecting a game console and connecting another external device, set Game Mode to Off in the System menu.   – If you display the TV menu in Game Mode, the screen shakes slightly.    Game Mode is not available when the input source is set to TV or PC.    Set Game Mode to On only after connecting a game console. If you turn Game Mode on before you have attached the game console, you may notice reduced picture quality.",™

t5_2qhfg,popmarazzi,1348166213,"Im telling you... as long as the SPL is decent (102+) the cost of the headphones doesn't matter with a decent sound card... If you do use expensive ones it IS better, but im telling you it goes nowhere but up after a good sound card. I dont get the downvote.  It seems most of these guys just get headphones and call it good when there is so much better sound processors out there to give you a HUGE advantage. Only problem is people will call you a wall hacker... but if you want to get nice headphones and hook them up to a crappy sound processor.... go ahead and waste your $$. Ever install car audio? Ever hook up a crappy amplifier to nice speakers and wonder why they still sound bad? Then try hooking up a nice amp to crappy speakers (as long as the watts are the same and they are not under driven) and see how much better they sound. Getting expensive headphones to cure a sound problem is like getting a new monitor to fix a graphics problem... Also keep smart volume off like mstkid said. You can pick up an X-Fi Fatal1ty Pro for around 100 bux refurbished. I dont know how it does it, (Accurate 3D positional audio with X-Fi CMSS®-3D. Locate enemies by sound alone - you'll get amazing surround sound, even with normal stereo headphones.) But it does sound fully 3-d. The chopper above you sounds like it is ABOVE, and guys in tunnels sound like they are below... it is weird/immersive. I will never go back to a non dolby card. Also it adds 64mb of x-ram which can be helpful taking off some load from your board depending on your current setup. ",®

t5_2qj68,marssaxman,1348172035,"An artist here in Seattle made thirty steel signposts, backlit, solar panels, acrylic faces, etc. Idea was to write semi-satirical captions for various playa art installations, then put the signs nearby. Signs each had directions leading to the next sign, so it was a self-guided half-parodical art tour of the playa. It was totally slick - he actually brought laser printers and heat transfer machines out to the playa so he could typeset the signs on site.  In no way did any of these signs modify the actual art - they were just going to be standing nearby, commenting on the art and recontextualizing it in a not-always-entirely-factual way.  When ARTery found out about it they said no, you can't do that, it's vandalism, if we find any of your signs out there we will tear them out. The artist eventually got them to assign him a spot where he could set up all the signs in a circle; most of them were blank, with a label stuck on reading ""Censored by the ARTery"" or something to that effect.  After he set this circle up, someone with a tractor happened by and got set to start ripping his signs back out of the ground! Apparently ARTery had put out an APB on him with instructions that people were to destroy his signs if they found them, anywhere. They did end up leaving the circle alone, but that's not at all what the point of the project was.  I really hope this is just one person's fuckup and not reflective of actual BMorg policy. Burning Man has always been the sort of place where you have serious heartfelt totally earnest art sitting right next to some jackhole with a megaphone heckling everyone, and that's not just okay, that's essential.  If BRC is now the kind of place where Art™ is Srs Bsnss with which you do not fuck, then it's lost something critical, it's lost the sense of freedom that blew my mind and turned me into an artist.",™

t5_2r4b9,mtfmtf,1348223789,"I experimented with Yasmin (a.k.a. Yasminelle®, Yaz®, Beyaz®, Ocella®, Zarah®, and Angeliq®) for a couple of months while self-medicating. I had been using Progynova (Estradiol Valerate) prior to that but decided to give Yasmin a go for two reasons:  1) It was considerably cheaper.  2) It contained Drospirenone - A synthetic progestogen closely related to Spironolactone.  I figured I'd be adding a Progestin *and* an anti-androgen for half the price of the Estradiol.   At the time I was taking 4 pills a day - 2 in the mornings and 2 before bed. I can't definitively say whether it had the desired effects or not but I ended up switching back to the Estradiol Valerate because at the time I felt it wasn't working as well.  According to my research, the dose was sufficient to achieve feminization and shortly after switching back to Progynova development slowed down again leading me to now think it was less to do with what I was taking and more to do with growth cycles and a diet that was not conducive of development.  In conclusion, external factors and a relatively brief sample period means results were inconclusive.  N.B.  Ethinylestradiol, the Estrogen in Yasmin, is among the most dangerous of the synthetic Estrogens.   Drospirenone affects your renal function.  Any self administered HRT is dangerous but these two components make this a particularly high risk drug. If you are going to go down the DIY path you should really do your research. The number of hours I committed to research isn't measured in hours or even days - I'm speaking weeks. Hundreds of hours. There is a lot of crap to wade through but you are taking your own health (and possibly your life) in your hands. No offence but if you are asking such fundamental questions as this, then I don't think you've done enough in preparation.   I'm not going to say whether you should or shouldn't self-medicate because I would do it all again given the choice; but do the leg work, take an interest in it. The research itself actually become quite 'fun' (for lack of a better word). The documentation available is very sketchy - often you'll need to infer and extrapolate from similar situations (Men suffering from gynecomastia, women with elevated testosterone levels, men undergoing treatment for prostate cancer, etc.) but that's just one of many hurdles.  *Edit 1*  *I realised I went on a bit of a tangent and didn't really answer your question:*  &gt;*whether or not a healthy guy in their mid twenty's would have any serious long term consequences to taking a pill a day for a month to feel/look a bit more feminine.*  *I'm in my mid twenty's, healthy enough, and have tried birth control pills as a HRT substitute and IMO, 1 pill a day for a month will have no noticeable effect at all beside possibly 'placebic' ones.*",®

t5_2s48x,MeshesAreConfusing,1348236310,"    General:          New certifications are now available to qualified infantry, pilots, and drivers.         Terran Republic and Vanu Sovereignty researchers have improved a few of their standard issue weapons. They request complete field testing, so good luck with that. Bring a helmet. See details below.      Notable Bug Fixes:          Iron sights now appear on Rocket Launchers.         Command has conceded that soldiers should have the ability to select their deployment point in Instant Action. You will no longer spawn in a different location than what you selected in the menu.         Vehicles should now be detected on the minimap when they are in close range unless they have Stealth certification.      Classes:      Engineers:          Nano Armor Kit technology is now available to all engineers. Certification is required for use. Use caution, they’re tiny.      Combat Medic:          Medic Applicators are now advanced enough to require further certification. These will change heal and revive speeds not to mention increase range.         Instructors at the Advanced Combat Medic Training Facilities have perfected a technique that now makes reviving a MAX unit possible however the stringent requirements will only bring them back at partial health.      Heavy Assault:          Certifying in improvements for the Nanite Mesh Generator will now increase the regeneration rate and may save your life on the battlefield.         With the proper training (certification) Heavy Assault will find the extra 3 pockets hidden on their suit enabling them to carry more rockets. We promise they are there!      Infiltrators:          Stolen encryption data will now allow an Infiltrator to hack an enemy equipment terminal and ""liberate"" supplies once certified. Many spies died to bring you this information so use it wisely.         Infiltrators may also use similar techniques to hack an enemy turret and higher levels of certification will allow them to do so more quickly. Turning them against your allies, no matter how funny, is strictly prohibited.         New Cloaking tech has now been approved for field testing which once certified will allow an Infiltrator to move much quicker when cloaked. Be warned that early results show a decreased effectiveness in armor when utilizing it. In fact, we can’t find the first few batches, so watch your toes. They’re out there. Just…invisible.         Controversial techniques now allow an Infiltrator to adjust their Cloak to provide more protection against damage. Certification in this skill is being required after the initial test subjects were brutally electrocuted. Whole lab still smells like bacon and regret.      MAX:          New manufacturing contracts will now allow soldiers to purchase a flamethrower for their MAX system for the low low price of 8,000 Auraxium! In unrelated sales, our patent pending” burn creams, ointment and do it yourself skin-graft™ “ kits can be had for the low low price of 9,000 Auraxium.         MAX units now require resources and have a respawn timer.      Vehicles:          There is extra space for more vehicle ammunition! With the proper certification we can show you how to stack, load, and store ammo more efficiently. Check out Relaod Speed increases as well. This may or may not involve the use of ridiculously priced bunjee cords.         Hover Control certifications are now available to show you how to make the Scythe, Mosquito, or Reaver hover better than a drill sergeant over a new recruit. Get trained today!         Due to new military aviation standards, ejection equipment is now available for certified pilots in all aircraft. While there is no dishonor in escape, remember that aircraft will be deducted from your standard pay.         Mineguard Certification is available to mitigate damage to your tank. Don't become a victim and ensure you are prepared. Remember the Nanite Systems slogan: “Mineguard: If it blows up, it’s probably your fault.”         All aircraft now have ECM packages available for Stealth certification to reduce detection range and increase lock on time.         A new alloy whose properties allow it to absorb more damage has been approved for use on all tanks. This will increase every tanks overall resistance to damage. Do not taunt the “new alloy.”         Pilots are now using minor magnetic fields around their aircraft to discourage Flak. As a result this weapon is very slightly less effective than it once was. Seroiusly how much impact will magnets have?         To combat overheating of Scythe and Reaver rocket pods, fire rates have been slowed.         The Skyguard Turret magazine size has been reduced to 40. Additional bolts have better secured it and reduced recoil.      Liberator:          A new resin on the exterior of the Liberator will now protect it better from rockets and missles. Yes, we said resin. Don't ask questions you don't want answers to.      Magrider:          Magburners are now standard issue on all Magrider tanks. Fuel Recycler certifications will not only recharge this ability more quickly but is better for the Auraxian environment.      Prowler:          In response to popular request, the Terran Republic command has authorized the use of additional front armor to increase defense of the Prowler.         The 120mm Prowler rounds have heavier loads which now do splash damage.      Sunderer:          New tech will now require certification to provide resupply and repair. Extended certifications will increase the effective range.         The Sunderer is now capable of use as a respawn point for infantry.         Valuable materials used in Sunderer production are in very short supply increasing the cost of this vehicle from 200 Alloys to 450. Don’t worry, we threw in the pine scented air freshener for free.      Vanguard:          Vanguard Shields are now a certification and item. Please remember to equip this item in order to ensure increased surviviability of the shield. We make a killing in resales.      Weapons:          Vanu Sovereignty scientists have found a way to increase the projectile speed of Vanu infantry weapon projectiles.         Experimentation is being done on light machine gun, carbine, and assault rifle weaponry for recoil. While vertical recoil is much more predictable, horizontal has been slightly increased. To be honest, just hope for a fat target.         New standard ammunition for Terran Republic Carbines, Assault Rifles, and Repeater have adjusted weapon damage.         Vanu Sovereignty Pistols are now doing increased damage. Seriously, Fred was just tinkering with it and bam! Don't touch any of the settings, we still haven't found two of his fingers.         The New Conglomerate and Terran Republic have long been harassed by Vanu Sovereignty Infiltrators and better equipped their infrantry. Long range kills with a sniper rifle may now require an additional shot.      World Design:          Facility Capture times have been changed. They increase based on the amount of influence and size. And before you say it, we verified with all sources and can confirm that is not what she said.         Warp Gate’s have been re-designed. It’s now easier to board your allies’ vehicles with less risk of being run over. Still be sure to look both ways before running out of the spawn area.  ",™

t5_2fwo,aim2free,1348266378,"Upvote from me (even though I know that that you downvoted me :)  &gt; it's worrying to learn that I haven't yet even *started* to understand computer science.  The answer you provided is exactly that kind of humble answer I appreciate from someone who has started realizing something.  &gt; I guess my PhD in bioinformatics   Cool, for my own, I'm actually sitting in a house with lots of bioinformatics people. We have our offices ([NeuroLogic](http://neurologic.se/) as well as [Wish-IT®, Wish Innovation Technologies ®](http://wish-it.se) *(the latter in development)* in the same house as my old research group (computer science but nowadays this group is denoted [computational biology](http://www.csc.kth.se/forskning/cb/), mostly brain simulations) where I did my PhD, nine years ago.  &gt; the algorithms I've published in peer-reviewed journals don't really count.  It counts, but to understand the issue of the bad impact of patents in software, it needs a lot more. As you obviously read my old experience from my Master Thesis Project in early 80-ies, and my references to the cartoons with Gyro Gearloose and Ludwig von Drake (my childhood's idols ;) but still kind of defend this abomination denoted ""software patent"" you have certainly obtained some kind of idealistic view that patenting an algorithm is not much different to patenting something else. Here you can immediately see a threat to free open source software. If an algorithm is published in source code, then everyone can read it, and everyone is able to improve it, so open source is an easy target. However, a proprietary software manufacturer, although they are getting quite rare nowadays fortunately, can hide their algorithms.  Regarding algorithms I can refer to a beautiful case where my PhD opponent was called as an expert witness in a patent trial early 2000. The company that claimed that their patent had been infringed by another company said they had aimed several years to devolop this algorithm, in court they had to describe what their algorithm did, and then my opponent (Prof. Hava Siegelmann) was called as a witness and being told the problem. She aimed less than 15 minutes to write an algorithm that was almost identical to the one claimed to be infringed. Case immediately dismissed :)  The idea of patenting an algorithm is simply not efficient! . Programmers invent all the time and solutiions which are obvious and trivial for an expert, like a programmer, may not be obvious for people outside this field. Patenting may be more efficient in some cases for proprietary vendors (which fortunatly are getting rare), but as soon as you publish the algorithm, it is no secret, then you get a conflict. Are other similar algorithms parallel inventions or copies? (As I'm  a programmer I can tell you that when standing in front of a particular problem, I do not start searching for any solution on the web, as there are not search engines for such searches, yet. I start solving the problem. When the optimal solution is found, this will of course be similar to any other close to optimal solutions found.The abomination detoned ""software patent"" can not help here.   By the way, as you are in research and have published your algorithms, I can refer to my own algorithms also published (I've developed an early warning system now used globally by WHO for adverse drug reactions), where I won an award for best application paper at [KDD 2005](http://www.sigkdd.org/kdd2005/awards.html). However, I do not understand, why are you defending software patents?   If you are in research you are certainly not there because of making profit from your work, but to work with interesting stuff, even though also people in ANN like Stephen Grossberg, has patented certain algorithmic stuff... insane!! Anyway, I definitely do not understand what this has to do with software patents. Although there have been cases of so called submarine patents where algorithms have been published and at the same time patented... this ugly thing happend LZW compression, gif and MP3 for instance. Fortunately there were ways out, png replaced gif, ogg replaced mp3 and so on, but still... Now, finally gif is free since some years but it's annoying.  By the way, where do you publish? Many of my research papers are terribly locked in by copyright beasts, although you can find most of them anyway. Of course if you are on a university network. One magazine [where I published in 2000](http://orre.neurologic.org/webref/index.html#orre:orlabali2000) ""Computational Statistics and Data Analysis"" turned out to be so expensive that my institute couldn't even afford the subscription, so they cancelled it. Nowadays there are plenty of better opportunities, especially in biology and bioinformatics. One of these journals are [Plos](http://www.plos.org/), where everyone can access your papers and your results can reach much more people.  I'll never ever publish anything any more without a Creative Commons or similar licence. There are too many valuable research papers locked in by strong copyright :( There are lots of people in this world who has been brainwashed into oblivion to believe in this obscure mystical but severly blind ""profit"" thinking. Despite they then cancel lots of opportunities for themselves and for the whole world to develop due to their work. I simply consider them insane. It's a kind of mental disease or disablement.",®

No, we hate Christians that believe it's their right to force their asinine notions of ""absolute truth"" onto the rest of society.  2. You can say whatever you like, just don't legislate from your warped sense of morality.  3. As evidenced by the fact that liberals are the ones actually fighting for equality of the sexes, genders, and races? Please, come back when you can stop projecting your own insecurities on us.  1. We react to what you say you believe and how you act. If your neighbor calls himself a Christian and believes that Christ was a 12 foot tall winged black man, we don't automagically assume that *all* Christians believe such nonsense.  3. Actually, if you take a position against tolerance, you're intolerant and thus harbor some kind of hatred. Oh, but please, continue to say that you're only financially supporting organizations that encourage child rape and the beatings of gay teenagers because those other people are not ""True Christians™.""  3. If you can demonstrate the existence of ""what makes sense"" without using your senses, more fool you. I'll be content with actual observation of reality, thank you very much.  3. Social disaster? So the only budget surplus in 40 years (Clinton), the civil rights movement, and general progress is *actually* a ""social disaster?"" Glad we've got our terms straight. What does that make the GOP/Tea Party results? Nuclear War?  3. Well... yeah, some Christians are. I mean, who *else* would honestly believe that the universe is only 6000 years old, that the first man and a rib-clone woman were tricked into eating a fruit by a talking snake, and that a geriatric man could build a boat large enough to house two of every animal (and seven of every ""clean"" animal!), not to *mention* get them all there... I could go on.  3. ""Secular Humanism"" isn't legislated atheism. On the contrary, in a secular society, all religions are given equal ability to thrive. So by forcing secular humanism onto all of you, all we're doing is making it illegal for you to discriminate based on your religion. I guess that makes us the bad guys?  4. If you can demonstrate this truth without a self-referential text, and with contemporary sources, I'm all ears. As it stands, there isn't one extra-biblical source from that area and general time with a verified firsthand account of the mission of Christ. But keep quoting it at me. I'm *sure* you'll find the right quote from the bible to convince me of the bible's validity *some time.*   -----    Sorry for just making a wall of text...

t5_2qh6p,Smerps,1348269652,"&gt; but my point is that capital gains is NOT the only place where money is taxed twice.  I'm well aware of that.  &gt;  I don't know the stats for investment rates against capital gains tax rate, but I can believe that if cap gains rate goes up then investment goes down.   Historically, that has always been the case. If you read the other posts in this thread, I'm sure you'll find links to back that up.  &gt; But if you think that cap gains is bad because it is taxing money twice you should be arguing for only having JUST income tax and nothing else.  I'm in favor of a flat tax with no loopholes. Then again, I can also see the merit of a national sales tax - that would bring in tax revenue from illegal immigrants and tourists.  We're definitely taxed waaaaay too much (those of us who pay taxes, anyway...the poor don't pay anything, and I think they should be forced to pay their Barack H Obama Fair Share™).

t5_2qhh9,jeannaimard,1348274104,"Bof.  Dans les années 70, le PQ était contre la Baie James et pour le nucléaire.  Entretemps, le nucléaire canadien s’est développé sans le Québec; même qu’une usine d’eau lourde avait été construite juste à côté, au coût de 1 milliard, mais elle n’a jamais été terminée parce qu’elle aurait fait concurrence aux usines d’eau lourde en Ontario et au Nouveau-Brunswick. Pendant que l’Ontario a développé une certaine compétence en énergie nucléaire (qu’elle a tout perdu dans les années 90 grâce à la gestion très «éclairée» des conservateurs de la Nonsense Revolution™), le Québec misait sur l’hydro-électricité du Petit Robert (Bokassa), le projet étant trop avancé pour reculer à l’arrivée au pouvoir du PQ en 1976.  Gentilly I et II ont été toutefois complétées et mises en service, mais elles n’ont jamais généré du courant de façon significative. Malgré ça, après 30 ans, on a une centrale arrivée à fin de vie dont la piscine de déchets radioactifs est pleine.  Donc, on a le choix de dépenser 2 milliards et continuer pendant 30 ans une affaire marginale, pour se retrouver avec 60 ans de déchets radioactifs, ou bedon de dépenser 1 milliard et de la fermer comme il faut (et se débarrasser convenablement des 30 ans de déchets).  Oh, oui, certes, le nucléaire est la façon la plus écologique de générer de l’électricité; par quantité d’énergie, c’est ce qui génère le moins de pollution.  Mais le Québec n’en a pas besoin; les autres pays qui en ont besoin on pu se développer des technologies beaucoup mieux rodées et l’expertise qui va avec.  On a la chance de pouvoir se passer de ça, on serait bien idiot de s’en passer.  Et les emplois? Bof, ça revient à combien la job?

Then there's Irelia whom I love when I'm fed, because she's fun to play when she's fed. All the tricks you can do with Q and the possibilities she gives to outplaying someone, but I dislike playing her early because I feel so useless. I'm not used to melee champions so creep aggro kills me every time.  Fizz is someone I enjoy playing due to fun mechanics and the jumping in and out style of play feels rewarding for some reason, but there's nothing more frustrating than missing his ulti which happens way too often to me.  Then this one is kind of an oxymoron. It's a champion I love playing but I hate playing him. He's such an easy champion to win with that I find him extremely boring, and no, this is not Yorick. Him I hate even though he's easy to win with. This one is Swain. I'm not at high elo so Swain is easy to win with but I tend to only win which is boring, since there's no adventure in that.  If I for some reason **had** to choose one, I would probably pick Annie. My sweet sweet little Annie♥",♥

t5_2qh0y,moor-GAYZ,1348331658,"&gt; Lack of copyright would make all published software ever free software.  Free as in beer, not free as in speech, and even then not necessarily.  There's a reason why GPL allows selling Free™ software for money, but specifically demands that the source code (""the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it"") is distributed along. Abolishing this requirement would make it impossible for almost everyone to enjoy any of the Four Freedoms™ (except for the little part of the zeroeth one, about using the stuff for free), and extremely hard even for the minority who enjoys digging through heaps of assembly.   If not practically impossible, too: it is a fallacy to assume that in a world without copyright proprietary software developers would continue the same lax practices regarding binary code obfuscation, the existence of Skype for example is quite worrisome in respect to the width of the gap between what is technically possible and what is _currently_ usually economically justified.  There's also a reason why GPLv3 includes the anti-tivoization clause, by the way.  &gt;  I humbly suggest to play that thought experiment: what kind of amalgate computers could we have tomorrow without legal limits to consider?  Well, this experiment doesn't need to be purely thought-based: in regard to computer games copyright protection is de facto non-existent (because they are not used by businesses where it can be enforced). In that case the answer ended up being: consoles, MMOs and ""online-only single player"" games. Somehow that doesn't instil me with much optimism regarding the big picture.",™

t5_2rxc8,AureliusTheLiberator,1348335540,"Antitrust *litigation* is very much congruent with libertarianism. If you didn't think so, what recourse would you have if a monolithic corporation like Monsanto decided to pump millions of chemical dispersants and pesticides into the air near your property?   Would you sit back and martyr yourself because Monsanto had violated your rights? Or decide to protest the inherent unfairness of the laws of matter? Oh yes, I'm sure that would be a rousing success. I'm sure they would even send you a written apology just as soon as they had moved their plant or factory somewhere else.   ...But how do you get them to *move*?  **A: Government, shazam!**  Protecting us from monopoly abuse of contracts is one of the few areas most libertarians DO see a valid opening for government. This includes things like pollution, which I laid out above; price fixing or price gouging, as the case might be due to the cartelization of certain goods; or colluding to prevent new entrants to the market, as one may argue the case is with the CPD. They are, after all, using their status as the two major political parties to exclude all alternative candidates from the debates, are they not?  There is no real reason that any libertarian (or Libertarian™) should object to this on philosophical grounds. Ideological? Sure, maybe. If you're a hardcore an-cap, then you probably find the government's own monopoly on the justice system morally repugnant... which means you likely find the use of such monopoly to be repugnant too. **But then it also means you probably hate the decision to accept matching funds, and that you hate our vice presidential nominee as well.** In which case you probably want nothing to do with the Johnson campaign and you're in the wrong subreddit.  ---  **For those who are interested, extra reading**: Ayn Rand had this to say in regards to accepting government privilege:  &gt;The recipient of a public scholarship is morally justified only so long as he regards it as restitution and opposes all forms of welfare statism. Those who advocate public scholarships, have no right to them; those who oppose them, have. If this sounds like a paradox, the fault lies in the moral contradictions of welfare statism, not in its victims.  &gt;Since there is no such thing as the right of some men to vote away the rights of others, and no such thing as the right of the government to seize the property of some men for the unearned benefit of others—the advocates and supporters of the welfare state are morally guilty of robbing their opponents, and the fact that the robbery is legalized makes it morally worse, not better. The victims do not have to add self-inflicted martyrdom to the injury done to them by others; they do not have to let the looters profit doubly, by letting them distribute the money exclusively to the parasites who clamored for it. Whenever the welfare-state laws offer them some small restitution, ***the victims should take it . . . .***  [Source](http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/government_grants_and_scholarships.html)  Now, I personally do not agree with many things Rand ever said, and I would wager that most libertarians don't either or else they would be objectivists. But on this note, her message is crystal clear. If your choice is between making yourself a further victim of the State or claiming restitution through what small ways the government offers you, you of course take the latter path.   If government is the cause of a distorted market, are you really going to leverage that argument to withdraw from the market entirely? If that's the case, who's winning? You or the initiators of force? And if you answer that you are, tell me: how does starving yourself of your rights further your principles? That's a classic case of chopping off your nose to spite your face, and if the libertarian movement does not wish to see themselves marginalized for all time, then they had better realize this FAST.

t5_2qyt6,TIGGER_WARNING,1348363971,"It's hard to know.  Look at how porn works: A far greater number of straight men than gay women consume gay porn featuring women.     You can figure that out just from the % ratio of homosexuality in the population to gay titles on the porn market.  Likewise, a far greater number of straight women than gay men consume gay porn featuring men.     So the marketing isn't necessarily indicative of the actual audience.   Finally, there are the broader gender interactions to think about. The concept of gay men and straight women sharing interests, taste in men, and generally being friendly with each other as a natural consequence of their relative sexualities is fairly pervasive in the western world, but there's no well-defined cultural notion of chumminess between gay women and straight men.  ***** ***** ###Edit *****  For those who aren't trolls, consider the math:  ▶ **~[1/3] of porn consumers are women.**^^[1]  If we *conservatively* estimate that only 1 in 17 of those viewers watch gay male porn regularly, then:  ▶ **The total number of women watching gay male porn is on par with the number of gay men who *exist*.**^^[2]  At a rate of 1 in 10, the number of female viewers jumps up to 1.65x the number of gay men who exist.   ***** ###Round Two *****  That could have been more clear. Let's try it again. First things first:   ▶ **Only ~2% of the population is gay.**^^[3]  I shouldn't have assumed that would be common knowledge.  Now a couple of points:  ▷ The statistic on female porn viewers is a somewhat fuzzy one.   ▷ The gay male statistic of [4/3] of a viewer out of 100^^[4] doesn't mean anything physically.    So: I rounded the number of gay male porn viewers in a representative sample of 100 up to 2.  ▶ **That's the same number, 2, that you'd expect if all porn viewers were male.**^^[5]  From this, we can see that if only 1 in 17 women consumes gay male porn, then:  ▶ **Female viewership is equal to the largest possible gay male viewership: 1 in 50 Americans.**  That 1 in 17 includes straight and gay women.    ***** ###The Purpose Of All This *****  *Only* to show how unlikely it would be for gay men to make up the majority of the audience for gay male porn.      ▶ **Given moderate or even low interest from women, female viewers will still outnumber gay men.**  No sneaky ulterior motives for this claim, just some back-of-the-envelope math.  ▶ **To be clear: No direct evidence was given for 1 in 17 women watching gay male porn.**  Anecdotally and intuitively, however, this seems plausible at the very least, if not probable.   ***** ###Notes *****  ^([1]: Not seeing the source on this specific statistic in google scholar results right now, but it's standard.)     ^([2]: This assumes rough equivalency between the porn viewing rates of straight and gay men.)     ^([3]: That's the figure you'll find if you look up the academic lit, the CDC's research, etc.)     ^([4]: Probability[Male Porn Viewer] x Probability[Gay] x 100 = [2/3] x [1/50] x 100 = [4/3])     ^([5]: Again assuming that gay and straight men consume pornography at roughly equal rates.)  *****",▶

t5_2qmij,carpe-jvgvlvm,1348371180,"I'm pretty fine these days until I have to any paperwork relating to my parents, and then I get ""frozen"", like a mental block. I can do all my own paperwork and bills fine, just not *their* stuff. I'll stare at their stuff for *hours*, frozen in anxiety, even though it's pretty easy stuff (pay a bill, write a letter, sign an agreement, etc.)  I consciously know why I'm ""blocked"": my dad is hyper-critical. ""Unintentionally abusive"" (criticism-wise). He was a perfectionist, especially financially, and thought I was a blonde ditz (even though I majored in math, heh). When I finally got on my own, life just got really nice and relaxed (college, b/f and marriage, babies). I didn't ignore my parents entirely; I just separated my life from them somewhat because they were so hard to please and critical. And they didn't seem to mind the separation. It wasn't ""bad""; they did their thing, I did mine.  Then in 2007, they were both in a pretty gruesome trauma, and I had to sorta ""take over"" their lives for 9 months (they were both in and out of hospitals for varying reasons all those 9 months; every other day was like a new fire to put out). I was young and did some morally-questionable things (though with guidance from my priest and even doctors). Primarily, **I vacated my dad's DNR**, and he's suffered ever since (half his heart is dead; he's had two amputations; had to learn to talk again; hard therapy; etc). I'm still unsure if I did the right thing (there are times since that he's said he's happier than he'd ever been!) But yes, it was ""wrong"" to vacate his DNR; I see that in retrospect. I was thinking with my heart and not my brain, you know? And I'd never seen ""trauma"" except on TV, I guess.  Then I had to get my mother committed against her will due to brain damage which presented as paranoid schizophrenia; she's *dangerous* (tried to throw my niece down stairs, attacked four police officers that first week in 2007...). I had to struggle for over 36 hours without sleep to get her committed, in a few different cities (because it was a weekend), and only when she tried to bite the face of her own advocate (from CSB) did they commit her. Mom was committed in another city, but escaped the first facility the first night. They gave me police protection that next day because she had apparently threatened to kill me. I was more worried for her safety and others'; Mom's not really like that — it's brain damage. Part of me thought she knew dad was dying in the hospital; she's a huge reason I fought to keep my dad alive.  But I did all that, cool as a cucumber! —Until things settled down near the end of 2007 (both parents home and relatively healthy/medicated, financially comfortable, etc), except I had to ""help"" them from that time on. Mom did okay with her anti-psychotics, but Dad was furious with me for keeping him alive against his will and him becoming a cripple. I had to go over there and write out his bills because he'd lost use of his hands (temporarily); and he was *cruel* to me (understandably; his DNR was very clear, and it was completely ignored).  My whole life changed that year, and I tried to keep my spirits up with friends and family (esp my babies!), but I was on the road all the time for my parents, raising my family, and making myself take ""breaks"" (have a social life) because I knew the basics of extreme stress. Still, I started having night terrors and panic attacks. GP put me on benzos, and I'm still on them. Psychologist was helpful but basically said I couldn't get better unless I stopped ""throwing myself under the bus"" (helping my cruel dad and [unintentionally] scary mom).  I took my psychologist's advice on many occasions, but when I hired help (on top of all their physical therapists and stuff) to ""do my dad's bidding"", Dad attacked the girl, and said he'd do it again and again; he literally wanted me to suffer (said so) because I'd kept him alive and should have to suffer, too. After that, my psychologist basically quit (*nicely*; great guy) because he said I couldn't get better under those circumstances.  That sounds horrible, but the lorazepam kept me going without taking things personally. CBT had helped me keep in mind it wasn't ""my fault"" (basically, that *shit happens*). My priest gave me absolution so the guilt wasn't so bad. A LOT of people in the community helped too (esp because of Mom): they'd visit, help fill out paperwork, etc. I was really blessed (and they didn't even know I was having stress problems; people just helped out of the kindness of their hearts!)  Finally, this year, they were both institutionalized (one nursing home, one mental institution) because they were both out of hand (Dad broke his hip; Mom tried to ""quiet"" his wheelchair alarm by attempted murder... institutions for them both!). I'd tried hard to keep them in their own home, but even Adult Protective Services got involved and basically said ""Aww hell no!"" Dad needed 24/7 care; Mom's meds had stopped working and she needed Haldol shots and a padded room.  I figured my pressure would ease up. I emptied their house (which was *harddddd*), am trying to sell it, became my mom's guardian officially, etc. Things *have* eased up, a *lot*!  —But I can't push myself to open their mail! I wait until people call me (collections!) and then try to work with them on the phone. I can't balance their checkbooks anymore; I can't do ANY paperwork re: them without freezing. Hyperventilating. Pacing the floor looking at unopened mail.  When their mail piles up enough, I shove it into a box. I have three boxes. I mean, it's *crazy*.  I keep my spirits up by focusing on my kids and blocking out my parents while I try to enjoy life; I even visit my parents, though that's hard because Mom (after years of anti-psychotics) is like a zombie, and Dad's gone back to being verbally **mean** (to me and the nurses) because he hates the nursing home. *But I visit.* With a smile on my face. (It takes courage to *get* there, but then I handle it well). I feel like that's what I can do, and pat myself on the back for doing it.  I just can't open their mail. (Even on the benzos! They switched me to Xanax recently, and that made me ""happier"" like drunk-happier, but STILL I couldn't open the mail.)  I know it's like PTSD, but I just can't get past it. I'm trying the mindfulness meditations to help me stay cool when I *see* their mail, but I'm not to the point where I can open the mail. I try to envision it, though.  I think, and this sounds horrible, but it's been a long haul taking care of them, and maybe I just want all the paperwork for my parents to be *over*. I'd rather scrub toilets for free (and actually, sorta do, for my friends!) than touch a piece of their mail. I know I have some anger towards Dad that I just can't seem to get past; maybe I *want* to see their home taken (failure to pay taxes) or something, because Dad was such a perfectionist with his finances. I hope that's not it, but I can't figure out what else it could be.  Sorry so long; just wanted it to be clear that my ""hangup"" has some real basis, and I've tried but just can't get past that mental block.  (You know, just writing this out has helped me a lot! Seriously! Shit, that's cool!) Maybe it's not so bad to just let their stuff go! (Well, except I'm POA and guardian. Oops!) But thanks for offering to help; sorry so long! ♥",♥

t5_2qzzs,BlessedBlogger,1348378138,"Thank you, I couldn't agree more. And like others have said, this is why I only lurk on the Paleo sub-reddit. Every other post is someone arguing over the Paleo-ness of bacon or dairy or Stevia. It's much ado about nothing if you ask me. Potatoes are the devil and you can't eat that because it doesn't have a balanced micro/macro nutrient count! People get so caught up in being Paleo-Perfect™ they lose sight of the benefits.   For many of us going cold turkey isn't feasible and I don't see any point in shaming the folks who aren't hardcore about this diet. Any step towards a healthier lifestyle is a step in the right direction and should be supported and encouraged. I'm not saying people can't offer advice, but you can do it in a helpful non-aggressive way. No one will hear you, no matter how valid your argument, if you're being a jerk about the way you present it.  When I first started this diet people would constantly pick apart my meal, like I was being graded or something. At this point I don't even like to say I follow a Paleo diet. If someone asks I say I eat the healthiest foods I can find within a reasonable distance from my home that also don't interfere with my medication, allergies or other health issues.   Grass-fed meat and organic locally sourced produce and dairy are a rarity but I get it when I can afford to splurge. And the truth is that on occasion I've been known to eat an ear of corn or a bowl of rice krispies. Not all of us have the money and resources to eat Paleo-Perfect™. Not all of us live next to an organic free-range grass-fed farm. Not all of us have grocery stores or farmers markets close to where we live or even transportation too such places. Some of us have illnesses and disabilities that make it difficult to cook things from scratch. And not all of us live with families that are supportive of this diet.  Everyday I remind myself that my experience is not your experience. What is available or possible for one of us is not what's available and possible to ALL of us. Just because you can do XYZ, doesn't mean that everyone (or anyone!) else can. The Paleo community is often seen as snobby, elitist, exclusionary and judgmental and it's not doing us any favors. Instead of always vying for the Paleo blue ribbon how about we focus that time and energy on helping the new folks find affordable, fun and easy ways to ease their way into a healthier lifestyle.",™

t5_2qqjc,qlube,1348379598,"The ""C"" in LLC means ""company.""  ""Limited liability"" refers to the fact that the owners of the LLC aren't personally liable for acts of the company.  As in, if the company gets sued and loses, the money has to come out of the company's coffers, not the personal savings of the owners.  However, corporations also have limited liability (which is why you don't see, for example, all of BP's public shareholders being sued over the oil spills).  LLC's tend to have a simpler ownership structure and are generally for smaller companies.  The primary difference between the two is tax treatment.

t5_2qh2b,Flene,1348384130,"Jasmine™ was developed by Jason Morrissey, who is best known for creating the extremely popular Alien Blue™ Reddit client apps for the iPhone and iPad. His work on Alien Blue™ was so good, it actually surpassed Reddit’s official mobile app. (Seriously, even the site’s founders ended up preferring it.) And like his previous work, Jasmine™ aims to offer a mobile solution that surpasses what’s already out there.  “It’s a far lighter project than Alien Blue™ and doesn’t carry a lot of bells and whistles, but it may serve as a simple alternative,” Morrissey said in his initial Jasmine™ announcement. In my opinion he’s being very modest, though.  The app itself offers a clean interface that includes nearly all the same functionality found on the YouTube website. The focus is obviously on searching/browsing for videos, as it’s the first button that appears when you pull up the app on your phone. Yet, you can also easily access your playlists, viewing history, favorite videos, and subscriptions.  Overall, Jasmine™ just has a simpler navigation as well as a few nice perks that improve upon the original YouTube iPhone app. For instance, there’s a flower-shaped icon at the very top of the screen that allows you to toggle the night mode on and off, (basically allowing you to switch from a white background to black). Jasmine™ also offers a greater level of control on how it functions as well, with options to determine video playback, appearance, parental controls, and more.  Jasmine™ was designed from the ground up to fulfill all your mobile video needs.  Jasmine™: think different.",™

t5_2rp0r,jfroncioni,1348414042,"Yes.  Here is an excerpt from my running injuries article:     ""Is it possible to rehabilitate the weakened muscles of a normally shod runner?  It certainly is according to another excellent study by Dr. Robbins (1987).  He asked 17 normally shod recreational runners to gradually increase barefoot activity both at home and outdoors over a period of several weeks and to maintain barefoot activity for about four months.  The runners' feet were examined, measured and x-rayed at regular intervals to detect changes.  Results showed marked improvement in the anatomy and function of the arch.  The authors concluded that the normally shod foot is capable of rehabilitation of foot musculature.  Very good news indeed for all of us.""

t5_2r8cd,Hibia,1348420951,"Nevermind, I lied in my feedback in my registry for entry that how I didn't have anything to post!  The site is useful. Some minor feedback is,  * Sorting by price shows all of the 0.00 games and then the highest priced games first. Being a cheapass I wanted to see free then lowest. * However, in attempting to switch from descending to ascending, I continued to get descending.    This is true for all of the sorting buttons. * A difficult one to replicate is strange sorting. Sorting by store the first time, I get Steam first. If I continue to sort random fields, and go back to ""Store"" I suddenly get ""Get Games"" first. * The sorting arrows do not seem to represent the method with which the sorting is occurring. * This is a non issue but fun to do. If you switch sorting using the text input box fast enough (I use up arrow and down arrow like a maniac) you can have ""Store"" displayed but sort by price. It also seems to switch the ascending / descending sometimes. It's really a non issue but try it! It's fun!  So in a nutshell, sorting is a bit odd! Other than that, it's a Fancy Feast ™. I'm using Google Chrome 21.  I was going to enter again to leave my feedback privately, but I believe this will also stem the flow of re-reporting.

The rebound is being driven by several factors including lower energy costs, higher labour expenses in competitors such as China and the potential to use idle US port capacity for pushing up exports, according to the report by Boston Consulting Group.  As a result the US has the potential to increase goods exports by up to $130bn by 2020, in the process adding 5m jobs to the US economy.

In particular, the cost disadvantage the US suffers compared with China is starting to decrease.  While in 2010, the cost of turning out a dollar’s worth of goods in a Chinese factory was on average 12 per cent less than the equivalent cost in the US; by 2015 the cost gap will be reduced to 7 per cent, the consultants say.  Hal Sirkin, a manufacturing expert at BCG, said: “A range of underlying changes are taking place in the US economy that will give a boost to manufacturing, even if some of this has yet to show up in the [production] data.”  However, the study’s findings have sparked scepticism among some economic analysts, particularly in the light of weak factory output figures in recent months. Last year, the US lost its role as the world’s biggest maker of manufactured goods to China, the first time for more than 100 years that the country had not taken this position.  Gary Pisano, a Harvard Business School professor who is co-author of a forthcoming book, Producing Prosperity: Why America Needs a Manufacturing Renaissance, said: “I still don’t see the indications that the kind of sea change in [company] behaviour [that could bring about a prolonged manufacturing recovery] is really happening.”  Alan Tonelson, research fellow at the US Business and Industry Council, a lobbying group, said the BCG’s upbeat conclusions failed to take into account “higher incentives” that competitor nations such as China were likely to provide their domestic companies to boost manufacturing.  “Countries such as China are unlikely to sit on their hands and do nothing if the US does improve in manufacturing,” said Mr Tonelson.  Also, there are signs that factory activity in the US is starting to dip, after a strong run during 2010 and 2011, when manufacturing added more than 400,000 jobs, compensating in part for some of the hefty employment reductions during the economic 2008/09 crisis.  In August, the Institute for Supply Management’s index for manufacturing showed its third straight month of weakness while the factory sector shed 15,000 jobs.  Even so, the ideas in the BCG report are supported by a number of large production companies such as General Electric and Toyota that are increasing their investments in the US, partly with a view to add to exports.  The announcements have led some to echo the consultants’ view that the US might be on the brink of a “reshoring” trend in which some lost manufacturing output gradually returns.  George Magnus, an economic adviser to the UBS investment bank, said: “I’m quite persuaded by the substance of the [BCG] arguments that the pendulum is starting to swing back to the US [in manufacturing] and away from countries such as China.”  ET Water, a maker of irrigation equipment in California, relocated manufacturing from China to the US last year. “We’ve already seen benefits through making quality improvements and finding it easier to meet orders more quickly,” said Mark Coopersmith, managing director. “In the past two years we’ve improved our margins and doubled [revenues] and a lot of this has been due to the move from China.”",©

In the context of biology, no matter what species you're talking about, if the genitalia requires fertilization then the _genitialia_ is female. _Staying within this context_, [""Female (♀) is the sex of an organism, or a part of an organism, which produces non-mobile ova (egg cells).""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female) Yet despite this, and I believe that you would agree, with respect to humans, having a vagina has no bearing on a person's gender identity. In this context they may be some degree of male and female, but that is up to something other than outward physical appearance or chromosomes, some process much more complex that we unfortunately do not yet understand.  Just because in one context genitalia is labeled as male or female doesn't mean that it disrespects or ignores the gender identity of those who possess such genitalia. Wouldn't you agree that AMAB individuals are not male to the extent that they do or do not identify as such, and the same for AFAB individuals and being female? This whole argument seems hinged on terminology. And, sometimes terminology is important. But scientific papers that, out of necessity, need to make a distinction between male and female physical characteristics in no way denigrate anyone's gender identity.  I shouldn't need to say this, but yeah I'm a trans woman and I fucking hate transphobia, but there is nothing transphobic about making a distinction between physical characteristics on one hand and gender identity on the other.",♀

From [this website](http://www.drsfostersmith.com/pic/article.cfm?aid=521):  &gt;Pyrethrins -  Pyrethrins, made from extracts of chrysanthemum flowers, have been in use for over 100 years and are common ingredients in flea and tick control products such as Drs. Foster and Smith Flea &amp; Tick Shampoo. Pyrethrins affect the nervous system of insects by influencing the flow of sodium out of nerve cells. This results in repeated nerve firing, and the insect dies. Pyrethrins are used to control ticks, fleas, lice, and mosquitoes.  &gt;Pyrethroids (permethrin, phenothrin, etofenprox, fenvalorate) -  Pyrethroids are synthetic relatives of natural pyrethrins. They are made in a laboratory and have a longer-lasting effect than pyrethrins. Examples of pyrethroids include permethrin (found in K9 Advantix II) and etofenprox (found in Bio Spot Defense Spot On for Dogs). Pyrethroids are often used in the environment to kill and repel ticks, fleas, lice, and mosquitoes. Many pyrethroids cannot be used on cats, so be sure to check the label for safety. Etofenprox (Bio Spot Defense Spot On® for Cats) is a pyrethroid that is labeled safe to use on cats.  (edit: damn you coding!)",®

I dry on my bbq using a method similar to the oven way, except with the bbq I package some wet mesquite chips in a tinfoil bag and place it right on the burner for a light smoke.  Hot and Sweet Venison Jerky  This jerky recipe flavors the venison with the heat of cayenne pepper and red pepper flakes, and is balanced by the sweetness of brown sugar and molasses. The recipe makes enough marinade for five pounds of sliced venison.   1 cup of soy sauce   1/2 cup of brown sugar   1/4 cup of molasses   1/4 cup of Worcestershire sauce   2 tablespoons of garlic powder   2 tablespoons of onion powder   2 tablespoons of canning salt   1 tablespoon of red pepper flakes   1 tablespoon of black pepper   2 teaspoons of Morton® Tender Quick®   1 teaspoon of powdered cayenne pepper   Make sure that the sugar and salt are completely dissolved before adding the marinade to the venison.

t5_2fwo,alkw0ia,1348524986,"In addition to the obvious issues for non-anglophone programmers, there are plenty of common non-ASCII characters in English.  The one I stumble across the most is that there are *no* dash characters in the ASCII set – and dashes are extremely common in English. Additionally, various other typographic symbols come up somewhat often, the big ones off of the top of my head being the degrees symbol, foreign currency symbols (and cents), and the © symbol. Finally there are a ton of loan words which require accented letters, plenty of which can come up in day-to-day work, depending on your field. `SELECT * FROM businesses WHERE type = 'café';`?   I'm constantly having stupid Python2 interpreters throw up on me because I typed a dash somewhere in my comments (And yes, I know about the encoding declarations; I'm lazy about using them, and given that Python2 basically wants nothing but ASCII source, I'm hesitant to constantly change that).   Avoiding non-ASCII characters in source code is highly annoying because it not only leaves your code riddled with escaped characters in literals and misspelled/mis-styled copy in comments, but also forces you to break your ingrained typing habits as you constantly have to remember not to insert basically anything non-alphanumeric.

On the one hand you have a well trained Knight in shining armor, lance, shield, sword, and the horse has armor also... *(or a $22 Billion carrier.)*   On the other hand you have a country bumpkin with a few pieces of wood and a piece of string called. Longbow, arrows. *(Or a bunch of $15 Thousand C-802 missiles.)*     Can you see where this is going?   ----   &gt;An interview with Joe Trento about C-802 missiles and what they mean for the Persian Gulf. vid: 11 minutes.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuFitD8ZbWA&amp;feature=player_embedded#t=50s  See also:   http://ivarfjeld.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/ins-hanit-missile-damage.jpg   http://www.ynetnews.com/PicServer2/04062007/1255062/2_wa.jpg   That was just one missile fired on a ship *during wartime action*. I do not believe the Phalanx CIWS can track terminal flight path maneuvers even one of these C-802's will make, never mind multiple missiles. (They'll be moving at 3X the speed of sound. and are fortified with air frames made in France, seeker-heads made in Israel and turbopulse-jet motors made in Texas and look like a Porch compared to China's VW's) even if the ships switched their radars to low level detection.   Keep in mind Iran will destroy EVERY US ship from Diego Garcia to the Mediterranean and every US base will be left unsupported and overrun by the indigenous people of what ever country it happens to be in.   Iran took down a US drone using a GPS spoof. ( http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2011/12/16/iranian-engineer-claims-simple-gps-hack-took-u-s-drone-down/ ) A Texas University professor showed them how less than $1,000 of stuff bought at radio-shack could do it.   **Then...**  Iran spoofed the GPS of an oil tanker and a guided missile destroyer AND HAD THE TANKER T-BONE THE DESTROYER. ( http://cdn2.spiegel.de/images/image-387865-galleryV9-rkap.jpg  ) This does not seem to me to be a case of the rails lightly brushing each other, but an actual collision between the bow of the tanker and the starboard side of the destroyer in a typical T-bone type fashion.  I think the odds that ether or both ships were NOT guided by autopilots at the time of collision to be vary low.  Taken to it's extreme, technology like this could make a US/Israeli missile aimed at a place like, say, Tehran hit at a place like , say, Riyadh or Bagram (Yes, even the nuclear tipped ones, if their using GPS.)  My question to you is: Do you think any one has told the Israelis this?  Another concern of mine:  Report: Iran 'blinded' CIA spy satellite. http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4162770,00.html  &amp;   Add these two things together:  http://news.discovery.com/space/iran-satellite-launch-120203.html  +  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kessler_syndrome    =?  If some one were going to kill you, why would you NOT do this, just to spite your killers?  *I think that is why the ""intelligence"" organizations are telling the ""politicians"" that bombing Iran is a bad idea.*   Don't get me wrong, I think the Mullahs are a bunch of ass-hats. *(Hence, my username.)* But I think we should bring our boys home and send in Ronald McDonald instead, ala the Soviet Onion...",☺

t5_2qh0r,Bonghitta1,1348528976,"Damn it I wrote a great reply and it got lost on my Nexus, let me try it again:  Ok I just wanted to leave with myside of the story up here as well. I won't post personal info, so as to not put rightcoast in a bad situation. But I do want to say, rightcoast is a solid, stand up guy. I thought it was Zak who banned me, cause hes a worthless mod, but rightcoast is doing what he feels is right. Let me explain why what I am doing is right.  Yesterday Mitch posted his personal information in the threads, alerting us to the fact he works at a company that I hold stock in. Now after much discussion with Mitch, it turns out he is (and readily admits)  a member of a group called EPS, the spammers you see in this subreddit.   EPS, as you may well know, are associated with all sorts of hate speech on here, infact here is just one of the MANY things I found about them. Honestly, this took me maybe 20 minutes of looking through peoples posts, ANYONE could find this info:  http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/yquwu/you_should_know_the_moderator_gang_behind/  Now, look. Mitch is a manager at this company, and unfortunately I have a equity interest in it. It is 100% my fiduciary duty to alert people at this company about Mitch and the group he is in online, EPS. What happens if the mainstream media sees the above posts and associate him with that? Do you think they will treat (this company) well? Will shareholders suffer because of his opinion?  If Mitch is a stand up guy, why doesn't he own his involvement with these people? Why would he not own the opinions of those he associates with? And if those are his opinions, should his managers at least know?  Anyways, I won't post here anymore except to troll the trolls. And give updates about Mitch.

t5_2ud8h,mctuckles,1348561396,"I've got both games and play them with the same crowd. On GW2's release, my friends and I played about every waking moment. This obviously caused some burnout, so now I only log in every other day or so. As for Borderlands, I can't play it often because summer's over, and as I said, I play MP all the time, so it's hard to get them together.  Impressions though? Guild Wars 2 is GREAT until you reach the later levels of PvE. I haven't had that much fun in an MMO since Ragnarok Online's early years (for entirely different reasons). It really encourages exploration and teamwork. This extends to the later levels too, but it starts to get buggy (and admittedly grindy to an extent) once you reach the last few levels (especially at max level). If you're interested in the PvP aspect. World vs World is actually really fun if you're on the right server (mostly the top ~10). There's actual teamwork and communication between unaffiliated players, and it really feels like a siege when you're on the walls of your fort, shooting at the golems and flame rams at the gates. I haven't really gotten into sPVP much, but I hear thieves are OP there.  As a final remark, I rate games by how much I pay vs hours spent, paid $80 for Guild Wars, logged about ~140 hours into it, so it's almost a 2x return. Really worth the money.  Borderlands 2 on the other hand is great for entirely different reasons. I've only played up until level 10, but so far, I've found it a blast. The dialogue is hilarious, the gunplay is excellent (as long as you're the host, we found there was some delay if you're not) and the loot drops are awesome. For example, my friend has a shotgun that you toss like a grenade when you reload. A new gun spawns in his hand afterwards.  I haven't been able to play it so much, but I paid $36 for it (4-pack from the UK came out to £22.50 per copy) and I've probably gotten about 4 hours worth in the first 2 days alone. It's looking to be worth its money in the long run as well, depending on how long the campaign is.  Personally though, I'd get Guild Wars 2 first. They're constantly releasing fixes, and they should be starting with the game updates soon™. Plus, I can see BL2 going cheap by Christmas, and extremely cheap by the Steam summer sale.  If you have any more questions, feel free to ask them. I'll try to answer as best I can.",™
t5_2rc19,RobertM525,1348561720,"&gt;Mot people on Reddit are also assholes, but I'm sure that's just a coincidence...  Yeah, though I think the [""Just World Fallacy""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-world_fallacy) plays a big role in that, too. (""I'm successful because I chose a good life-path and therefore I deserve my success. They're unsuccessful not because life can be cruel and unfair but because they deserve it."") For some people, though, they're just low on the [openness to experience](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Openness_to_experience) personality trait, so they see no value in a college education which isn't just elaborate job training.   &gt;&gt;    Anyway, I realize this is quite a tangent,  &gt;That's what Reddit is for!  Perhaps, though I worry that my tendency to elaborate or explain things only tangentially related to the subject at hand can sometimes be distracting or annoying. :) (If it wasn't obvious yet, I've long wanted to be a teacher. Or junior college ""professor."")  &gt;Understanding intrinsically models for more and more complicated interactions, rather than generalizing them in ""groups"" of interactions, as we normally do.  Yeah, or relying on imperfect analogies and metaphors.  &gt;I agree, this is what they are thinking of. It's east to imagine that ""intelligence"" is a linear relation to processor power/software efficiency.  Yeah, though I again worry about this making a lot of sense since it presumes a framework for human-level cognition (or better) operating on sub-par ""hardware,"" just waiting for its potential to be unlocked. Which is not to say that it's *completely* absurd, just not extraordinarily likely compared to other scenarios which result in an AI (or [""AGI,""](http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/AGI) I suppose I should say; a term I found on a site you linked some time ago detailed the paperclip maximizer which I looked up again to try to explain the concept to my wife (who essentially rejected it as generally absurd in her opinion ;) ) ).  &gt;However, this is kind of where anthropomorphism steps in; they think that the AI will get to ""human level"" and stop getting meaningfully smarter. Nearly all AIs I can think of in fiction like this are basically just ""smart humans"".  There's that and the extraordinary difficulty in imagining things so far beyond your own capability. I'd wager we can't accurately conceptualize a super-intelligence or its perspectives. OTOH, I guess we don't have to do it on the fly, so we might be able to deliberateively and cooperatively construct the on-the-fly thinking of a super-intelligence, even if *its own* deliberative thinking remained largely beyond us.  &gt; Generally, when an an author tires to portray a truly post-human intelligence ""accurately"", they usualy paint in grand strokes of how such an intelligence shaped the universe with superhuman influence.  A forgivable sin, IMO, considering the alternatives. :)  &gt;The thing with the Geth though, is that they were kind of designed to be generalized. The Geth programs were designed to swap between functions and optimize themselves for a variety of tasks, with the ability to share ""memories"" equally among all programs.  &gt;I don't know if this counts, though.  I think it does to a point. On the one hand, it makes sense for how the Geth could become a (collective) AGI. OTOH, it doesn't make sense why the Quarians would design such utilitarian machines with capabilities like that. I just can't imagine such a thing making it anywhere near production before someone did a cost-benefit analysis and said, ""Wait, why the hell do these things need to be *that* flexible?"" It would be no trivial task to make such a system, capable of learning and adapting to such a wide range of environments.  In fact, it was one of my wife's arguments against the paperclip maximizer: why would such a thing be so needlessly over-designed? In a world where a computer in charge of something trivial like paperclip production could be that flexible/potentially intelligent, it probably would be dwarfed by other, more important AIs who *would* have our interests at heart.  OTOH, I said that the point is supposed to be that someone accidentally left off a critical component of the AI's design (namely, Asimov's laws-like protections), and the oversight, combined with an [intelligence explosion](http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Intelligence_explosion), results in our destruction.  &gt;Again, the Geth were programmed to optimize themselves, which is how the networking and eventual consciousness began. The Geth weren't optimized to ""help Quarians"", they were optimized to ""preform tasks"". If the Geth were designed to keep track of efficient means of accomplishing tasks, then wiping their memories would erase that learned ability, something that they would want to stop.  &gt;Maybe...  Perhaps, perhaps. It might still be a leap from that to a recognizable survival instinct. I think for sci-fi authors, it's seen as a foregone conclusion, since all animals have it. You could see it as out-of-control anthropomorphizing, except it's not even *anthropo*morphizing so much as it is just general animal/organic-morphizing, if you will. The Geth could very well have become AGIs and even fought the Quarians while still retaining hopelessly ""stupid"" behaviors, like mopping and ditch-digging. (Rather like the paperclip maximizer, really.) There's no reason why an AGI has to become philosophical and introspective and pursue quasi-humanistic goals we recognize as legitimate (e.g., ""building our future"").  &gt;In fact, this is actually why Strong AI is worth thinking about at all. If the dangers were purely from self-replicating nanomachines, no one would be working on it. But, a Strong AI has the potential to do with perfect efficiency things which humans simply could not. Strong AI can be the solution to mundane problems (any possilbe disease, for example), but also solve problems that humans aren't smart enough to solve (Complex energy systems, the Heat Death, peace with all other humans to stop war, ect.)  I honestly think we need an Asimov's laws-controlled super-AI in charge of everything, to protect us from our own stupidity (including paperclip maximizers). A Shepard, if you will. ;)  The worrisome thing, of course, is who will have the funding that eventually creates the first strong AI (assuming we ever pull it off). A Defense Contractor doing it would be potentially frightening, of course, but there are plenty of labs where it could happen accidentally and have disastrous, paperclip maximizing-like results.  &gt;Only if we don't program them right. That's the ultimate lesson in all of this, we have to understand consciousness better before we start trying to make it. More importantly, we have to preemptively understand consciousness so as to avoid creating dangerous thinking machines in the first place.  &gt;Or, psychology will save the world. Basically.   LOL. Yeah, except no one listens to ""us"" (assuming I can use the first person plural here). I was just reading about the *Columbia* disaster tonight, and I can tell you social and industrial-organization psychologists probably could've predicted (and vetoed) some of the stupidity there and maybe prevented the accident.  &gt;The report was highly critical of NASA's decision-making and risk-assessment processes. It concluded the organizational structure and processes were sufficiently flawed and that a compromise of safety was expected no matter who was in the key decision-making positions. An example was the position of Shuttle Program Manager, where one individual was responsible for achieving safe, timely launches and acceptable costs, which are often conflicting goals.  It's the same kind of shit that caused the *Challenger* disaster! In fact, the *Challenger* disaster is routinely used in social psych classes as an example of GroupThink and its consequences. (The Cuban Missile Crisis is typically used as an example of the opposite in effect, where GroupThink is prevented from happening because of the specific way the President and his advisers structured things.)  Or there's how little the opinions of developmental psychologists are weighed in school environments. For all the research that's been done on learning and cognitive development, surprisingly little of it is incorporated into school program design. (Though brand-new teachers are at least exposed to it when taking Education classes.)  As bad as that is, there's also the fact that there's nothing like an APA ([this one](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Psychological_Association), not [that one](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Psychiatric_Association)) handout with universally agreed upon parenting tips given to new parents when their children are born. (I know I sure as hell would've appreciated one!) I mean, developmental psychologists have learned *so many* useful things that could help out *so many* first-time parents who were never around kids growing up (like my wife and I), and yet it's just not available to the general public. Instead, people rely on *Reverend Wayne's™ Manual on Corporal Punishment and Superior Parenting™*. (OTOH, many parents might eschew any APA recommendations and go with something like that anyway. But it would be nice if it were at least generally available.)  The biggest problem, of course, is that every person *is* a person know people and therefore everyone thinks their an expert in human behavior. I swear every social psych textbook in existence must start with an explanation of [hindsight bias](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindsight_bias). (Though admittedly I have a sample size of only two to go on for that. :) )  Anyway, in short... I wish. :)  On an unrelated note, I just finished *Snow Crash* and I'm looking for something else to read. You seem pretty well-read—any recommendations on some good sci-fi?  (I can't believe I can write a 1,500 word Reddit post but can't manage to write anything else these days. Oy.)",™

t5_2rnve,Squaky,1348589478,"About two weeks ago I picked up an HP Laptop | Specs:  * CPU: Intel® i3-2350M 2.3GHz 3MB cache  * Ram: 6 GB DDR3  * Graphics Card: AMD Radeon HD 7670M 1 GB  * Hard Drive: 750 GB 5400 RPM  (That's all I can remember atm, if you need more information let me know)  Reason I got a laptop is so that I have something to use in College and to use for gaming while at the same time having a $600 budget. I realize  that I could have built something but I was splitting it with my dad and was getting %50 off of a new computer, and his request was that I got a laptop (not complaining, here's my old **[desktop](http://imgur.com/fuulk)** specs)  Now to the point, while my computer matches if not surpasses the recommended specs for CS:GO, I can't run it without dipping below 30fps in common spots. My only guess is that my CPU is too weak for the job, even though I was told by a lot of people that for just gaming, a dual core should suffice. Also, my graphics card drivers are up to date. Any suggestions or am I screwed? ",®

t5_2cneq,disco_biscuit,1348628129,"I usually don't agree with Taibbi but this one is good.  And right.  Generally speaking, 40% of the country is voting for him in November just because he's a Democrat.  And 40% is voting against him because he's not a Republican.  That leaves a margin to play with, which is probably actually smaller than 20%.  And he'll get less of that middle-slice in 2012 as opposed to 2008 by virtue of the fact that the economy still stinks.  Blame it on whomever you want, but he's the President, has been for four years, and this shit still stinks.  And while I'm happy to vote for him again, I certainly wish he had been able to make more progress on by now.  But I still think he's the better choice and moving things in the right direction - moreso than I trust Romney to do.  What I don't get is why people still say this election is close.  Maybe Obama is polling around 50% - granted, that's not great.  But the economy sucks - 50% approval deserves a fucking trophy when you consider how much the economy blows.  But I digress.  Look at an electoral map - this shit is over.  Only maybe 8 states are really up-for-grabs, and Obama only needs 1-3 of them.  Hell, he takes Florida and it's pretty much over, right there.  The electoral college absolutely favors Obama, big time.  Now, that said, everyone needs to get out and vote.  But let's just all realize that this shit isn't really that close, and anyone telling you otherwise is either a Romney supporter or a news outlet that just wants to keep you tuned-in to their 24/7 coverage because this is going to be a *""historically close election""*™.  As for my not usually agreeing with Taibbi... the more he talks about politics and opinion... the more I agree.  When he starts going on his economics rants... his lack of knowledge beyond becomes glaring.  You need a certain skill-set to be a reporter and/or writer.  You then need cross-functional knowledge and experience to write about economics, or politics, or technology... and so on.  The guy can write.  And he has the politics angle down.  But he has far to go when it comes to the mechanics of global finance.  We need to get Krugman to sit this guy down and teach him what's what before he tries to break another LIBOR story.",™

t5_2qh1i,H5Mind,1348633636,"**Desiderata**  Go placidly amid the noise and haste, and remember what peace there may be in silence. As far as possible without surrender be on good terms with all persons. Speak your truth quietly and clearly; and listen to others, even the dull and ignorant; they too have their story. Avoid loud and aggressive persons, they are vexations to the spirit. If you compare yourself with others, you may become vain and bitter; for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.   Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans. Keep interested in your career, however humble; it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time. Exercise caution in your business affairs; for the world is full of trickery. But let this not blind you to what virtue there is; many persons strive for high ideals; and everywhere life is full of heroism.  Be yourself. Especially, do not feign affection. Neither be critical about love; for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment it is as perennial as the grass.  Take kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering the things of youth. Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune. But do not distress yourself with imaginings. Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness. Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself.  You are a child of the universe, no less than the trees and the stars; you have a right to be here. And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should.  Therefore be at peace with God, whatever you conceive Him to be, and whatever your labors and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life keep peace with your soul. With all its sham, drudgery and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful world. Be careful. Strive to be happy.   **© Max Ehrmann 1927**",©

t5_2rlua,cenorexia,1348660059,"My thoughts on the new Game Mode: **Aftermath Hangover™**  Platoon threw a party after a successful bombing raid and your squad leader had a few too many shots. The sober teammates have to escort him from da club in (destroyed) downtown back to mission HQ.   Only vehicle is a '93 Honda Civic.  Instead of vehicle health, the driver has something called ""Puke-O-Meter"". If you're driving too fast/wild, it'll go red and you have to pull over for the squad leader to vomit. If you don't stop and he spills it all over the back seats, the car gets ""disabled"".  New class ""Cleanser"" may fix the vehicle.  Outside of the car, the controls for squad leader are randomly messed up. Pressing ""JUMP"" will make you turn around, pressing ""FIRE"" will make you jump, etc. Also everything's still blurred and you'll constantly walk slowly in random circles. It's like being suppressed all the time mixed with a disabled jet's move pattern. Standing still is not possible.  Squad leader may not hit the ground or pass out!  So while one team mate is cleaning the vehicle, the other two have to constantly hold a button (like arming / defusing an M-COM) while standing in close proximity to your stumbling squad leader. This will grant you ""Squad Assist"" points and prevent the squad leader from falling to the ground.  If you don't pay attention and squad leader passes out or hits the ground, the round's lost.  Opposing team tries to hinder your squad from reaching HQ. They also have cars to ram yours. Ramming = Car loosing control = Puke-O-Meter all over the place. Therefore the rest of your team needs to defend the Honda Civic at all cost!  So, yeah, in the end it's kinda like CTF but instead of capturing and returning a flag, you capture and return your drunk squad leader.",™

t5_2qh6p,freshbrewedcoffee,1348661945,"&gt;    JefftheFuckingAwesom -6 points &gt;     &gt;    It's funny how Jews like you only use certain words in certain settings. For example, Ahm. was preaching against ZIONISM, yet you use the word ""JEW"". That's a huge difference, a difference every Jew knows, but it's not as reminiscent of the Holocaust™ when they make it about Jews with SPECIFIC OPINIONS as just Jews in general. &gt;     &gt;    Also, I'm not sure what ""conclusion"" you're mentioning. That the Zionist media is banging the war drums to send American troops and American money into another endless war with Israel's enemies? That's probably why we're against it. &gt;     &gt;    I'm also curious about the word ""democracy"". So many redditors are rightly against the restrictive internet acts earlier this year, some of them had to notice that these ""democratic peoples"" were the ones passing and sponsoring this legisiation (Feinstein, Boxer, the usual Jewish mafia members). Are you talking about the democracy where one nation builds gigantic fences around it's borders and restricts immigration? Because that's what Israel has and, thanks to Jewish politicians like Chuck Shumer, it's funded by the Americans. Shumer, of course, voted against allowing Americans to use their own money to close their own border with a fence. Why's that? Jewish duplicity, mainly. &gt;     &gt;    Israel isn't a democracy in any sense of the word and she's not our ally. I can't think of ANY American's arrested for espionage that weren't Jewish agents working either for the Jewish cabal in the USSR or directly for Israel. How does Israel respond to these events? She demands year after year that we release Israelie spies to be sent to Israel. What a great ally! &gt;     &gt;    This is the same ally that honors and promotes Jew's in the IDF and MOSSAD that were attempting to launch false flag attacks against the US to get us involved in the Middle East on the side of our friendly, democratic allies. &gt;     &gt;    We're also contributing more money to Israel's defense than are the people of Israel, how absurd is that? We're in a horrific financial crisis, caused by Ben SHALOM Bernanke and his buddies like Geithner etc. etc. etc., we're having to borrow tons of money from China (and, of course, from SHALOM Bernanke) to support and subsidize Israel. &gt;     &gt;    When South Africa had apartheid the Zionist media made sure everyone knew how bad it was, boycotts and the like. But Israel is referred to as the ""jewish state"" and, for some reason, that's not only OK but mandates that the US contribute the lives of our young men and our money to keep that JEWISH state afloat. &gt;     &gt;    Iran is surrounded by 40 US military bases and combined arms groups. Iranian media, not owned by the Zionists that control our media, don't forget things like Netanyahu telling the US in 1992 how Iran was on the cusp of nuclear weapons and that, oy vey, if the US didn't intervent Washington DC could be destroyed! Once Americans realize how the Zionists are constantly playing every advantage to maintain their racially pure nation-state, and how Israel supports false flag attacks to entice Americans into these wars, you can imagine how we're not exactly happy at the amount of Bernanke/Greenspan notes that we're having to print, passing the debt to our kids, to keep this nation-state afloat.",™

t5_2us65,KatelynLinker,1348664811,"I chose the Leukemia and Lymphoma society as the business I wanted to evaluate. They are obviously a medical business, but they still have to make arguments for patients to use their services and for people to donate. The first thing you will read on their “About LLS” page is that this society is “the world’s largest voluntary (nonprofit) health organization dedicated to funding blood cancer research and providing education and patient services.” This initial statement combines the use of evidence and values. They state the fact/statistic that this society is the world’s largest organization dedicated to this cause which seems to give it some credibility. Also, but adding that it is a nonprofit organization, they are hinting at the values associated with working for a good cause. Making money isn’t their first priority. If you read on, you will see that the society’s “commitment to cutting-edge science has contributed to an unprecedented rise in survival rates for some people with blood cancers.” This is utilizing a cause and effect type of argument. They are stating that the society’s commitment to science has caused a rise in survival rates. This implies that they have statistics and facts to back up this claim and adds to their credibility. On another part of the website dedicated to the research this society has been doing, it states that, “For more than sixty years, the Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society (LLS) has supported groundbreaking and lifesaving research.” This statement combines evidence (that they have been doing this for 60 years), values (that life saving is important to them), and credibility (making them seem trustworthy). Their arguments aren’t typically based on testimony, but they are always based on facts and hinting at values. People will trust this society because it is working for a good cause and keeps the values of the patients and donors in mind.

Few games that were designed for the Xbox 360 pad in mind and have remappable controls actually work that well with it.  It's like JSR HD.... For some reason the A button is mapped to where the Y button should be, spraying is impossible without either using either an official Xbox 360™ gamepad - which is like.... £35 - £40 including the wireless dongle you need to connect it to your PC - or a keyboard because no button has been or can be mapped to it and pause is where the RB button should be.  And the worst part about Jet Set Radio HD, the only controls you can remap are keyboard controls. You cannot even remap any gamepad controls on the launcher where you'd normally remap such stuff and change graphical settings.  My other complaint is about Super Meat Boy.

t5_2qixm,metropolypse,1348687137,"a) Lyrics in the intro song. LYRICS! IN THE INTRO! I should stop here. 2a) They abandoned the one-off episode in the later seasons, in favor of a story-arc model of show-writing, like true blood or weeds or six feet under or breaking bad or [insert modern successful TV show]. Maybe that's a factor of it being a modern TV show! Still... feels like a deliberate shift in their approach and intended audience; one that didn't sit well with me. (pre-edit: Yes, I know that Voyager did this with the ""trying more urgently to get home"" stuff at the end, and DS9 did it when the whole galaxy went to war, but that shit was pretty masterful right there.) 2) Enterprise completely abandoned the Star Trek morality. In the latter half of the series, it became an ode to the post-9-11 mentality that says it's okay to sacrifice our principals in order to keep ourselves safe. Did they do a good job at constructing situations where we Really Super Had To Do It™? Yes. But so did the show *24*. They're still both pro-torture propaganda pieces--I don't think that was the intent, but in pursuing drama and depth of character, the writers, like the captain, forfeited some of their moral compass.  c) They make a number of attempts to show that the captain is just another guy; he's informal with Chip and the other officers, etc. This goes back to point 2 a bit, but mostly it tosses out the honor and gravity of the naval tradition for an approach more befitting a flyboy/cowboy. That's Riker's role, not Picard's.  d) I think they can be forgiven for point C as an outgrowth of another problem, where hey tried so hard to paint the Vulcans as the condescending holder-backer, giving the crew a kind of ""MURICA, FUCK YEAH"" look and feel. (""URTH, FUCK YEAH"") This bothered me. I just don't think the vulcans would act that way. They would probably instruct the humans on ways to make sure their foolishness didn't harm others or pollute space, or something like that, and leave them to their own devices. Vulcans are patient and tolerant of others. This conflict seemed contrived, and the fact that it seemed to be the driving force behind so many other writing/plot/character decisions really bothered me. e) Yeah, I mean, it was still Star Trek! I watched the whole series.  **TL;DR:** *Enterprise* abandoned some of the core principals of the Star Trek franchise, striking a more jingoistic tone, creating episodes around a militaristic storyline instead of parables with morals at the end. And it leaned so hard on the conflict with the Vulcans to drive the plot that I couldn't really take it seriously as the prequel to the rest of the Star Treks and the founding story of the Federation.",™
t5_2tnz9,Illuminatesfolly,1348687297,"That argumentation is a *little* bit too adaptationist. It's much more likely that the birth canal and the poop chamber (real science™ term) just happened to be near each other as mammalian complexity developed. However, the poop bacteria thing does seem like something that would contribute *slightly* to the maintenance of that trait.   The key error is in your justification  &gt;something doesn't have to happen every single time for it to have a purpose in happening.  Nothing in evolution ever has a purpose in happening beyond its basic mechanical function.

t5_mouw,christ0ph,1348689181,"In 2005, Ellen Heber-Katz, a scientist researching cancer at the Wistar Institute discovered a strain of mouse that can regenerate organs and limbs.   To identify each mouse, they use tags that are stapled to their ear. The holes in the ears of this strain of mice were growing shut.  See:  The scarless heart and the MRL mouse. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1693365/   This strain of mice, the MRL mouse, can regenerate limbs that are chopped off. They can regenerate heart tissue, limbs, etc.   When that was discovered in 2005, regeneration was already a growing branch of research. We are learning more and more about how to enable  regenerative abilities in humans.   Here is an example of recent research on regeneration.   Matrix Biol. 2010 Oct;29(8):690-700. Epub 2010 Aug 24. Extracellular matrix-derived products modulate endothelial and progenitor cell migration and proliferation in vitro and stimulate regenerative healing in vivo. Vorotnikova E, McIntosh D, Dewilde A, Zhang J, Reing JE, Zhang L, Cordero K, Bedelbaeva K, Gourevitch D, Heber-Katz E, Badylak SF, Braunhut SJ. Source  Department of Biological Sciences, University of Massachusetts, Lowell, MA 01854, USA. Abstract  Most adult mammals heal without restorative replacement of lost tissue and instead form scar tissue at an injury site. One exception is the adult MRL/MpJ mouse that can regenerate ear and cardiac tissue after wounding with little evidence of scar tissue formation. Following production of a MRL mouse ear hole, 2mm in diameter, a structure rapidly forms at the injury site that resembles the amphibian blastema at a limb amputation site during limb regeneration. We have isolated MRL blastemal cells (MRL-B) from this structure and adapted them to culture. We demonstrate by RT-PCR that even after continuous culturing of these cells they maintain expression of several progenitor cell markers, including DLK (Pref-1), and Msx-1. We have isolated the underlying extracellular matrix (ECM) produced by these MRL-B cells using a new non-proteolytic method and studied the biological activities of this cell-free ECM. Multiplex microELISA analysis of MRL-B cell-free ECM vs. cells revealed selective enrichment of growth factors such as bFGF, HGF and KGF in the matrix compartment. The cell-free ECM, degraded by mild enzyme treatment, was active in promoting migration and proliferation of progenitor cells in vitro and accelerating wound closure in a mouse full thickness cutaneous wound assay in vivo. In vivo, a single application of MRL-B cell matrix-derived products to full thickness cutaneous wounds in non-regenerative mice, B6, induced re-growth of pigmented hair, dermis and epidermis at the wound site whereas scar tissue replaced these tissues at wound sites in mice treated with vehicle alone. These studies suggest that matrix-derived products can stimulate regenerative healing and avert scar tissue formation in adult mammals.  Copyright © 2010 International Society of Matrix Biology.

It's a bit of a spin job on the part of TGC to distance the divorcees from TrueChristianity™  This article here gives a tad more insight, though I suppose we'd have to dig up the study itself to get the whole story: http://www.usatoday.com/news/religion/2011-03-14-divorce-christians_N.htm  Maybe it would have hurt them too much to admit that nominal Catholics (a church repeatedly lambasted by the New Calvinists) have lower divorce rates than nominal evangelicals, so they fudged the details a bit ;)  EDIT: But... Get used to it. In evangelical circles in general and New Calvinist circles in particular it's generally assumed that anyone outside of their little group doesn't take their faith seriously. I laughed out loud when a speaker was introduced for a TGC conference: ""He ministers in a Presbyterian church, but despite that, he's managed to struggle for the Gospel and preserve the truth of Christianity.""  Presbyterian! It's not even as though the Presbyterian church is particularly liberal - from what I've seen, they mostly tend to be on the conservative end of the spectrum. But they're mainline Protestant rather than evangelical, so obviously they don't know the True Faith™",™

t5_2sc3f,BeerGogglesFTW,1348753961,"I don't really know anything about Linux other than its an Open-Source Operating System.  Lets say, Valve is able to get Steam and all source engine games onto Linux (which seems to be the case)..   * Would every other game on Steam be incompatible with Linux?  * Would the Linux catalog of games need to be built from the ground up?  * And if this is a direction devs/publishers want to go, how would it effect the games? Is their more or less potential in gaming on Linux? Valve says their games run faster on Linux than Windows 7 (via Google). Is this because... Valve wants their games to run better on Linux, so they put in the dev time to make it so... or does Linux have the potential to do this for all game?  After some reading it seems when Valve started the experiment they struggled to get 7 fps with Linux on a monster rig. Now they are able to get about 15% increase over Windows 7.  Does anybody think if this takes off, Windows will flex their wallet muscles forcing games to be Windows? Does Valve have something else up their sleeves in terms of getting Windows games to play on Linux? (That can't be legal, so I'd think not)  EDIT  &gt;In the long run, Newell says, he'd like to get all 2,500 games now available through Steam running on Linux. That's a tall order, but it may just be possible if it turns out that Microsoft's proprietary technologies make for an inferior gaming platform. ®",®

The 7 point gain by the BQ in Quebec, apparently all at the expense of the NDP, is worrying. Abacus showed a similar shift, but I'm hoping this is a Marois bump if nothing else. The CPC's numbers might be concerning for them: The majority of their drop came from Seat-Rich Ontario™, while their gains were in Man/Sask and BC.

I am allergic to most jewellery you'll find on the internet, so I had to make sure I could wear these things all of the time without having a swollen ear or something along those lines. I bought the supplies on Etsy, from three different sellers, and assembled them myself.  Two weeks ago, I went to have my ears pierced two extra times (the middle hole was already there, used to be a strech-thingy) and then I had to wait it out until both were healed. The one closest to my face still isn't healed, so when I go out, I put two of the ear rings in the same (middle) hole, but of course I made an exception for the photo! ;) Shouldn't be longer than a week more before the third hole can be permanently occupied with my new earring!  ###&gt;☠&lt; *Will you make some for me/sell them?*  I am planning on opening an Etsy store where I will be selling these earrings upon demand;  I will offer three things:   1) A set of three (3) separate earrings like the ones portrayed in this post  2) A separate order of one (1) earring like the ones portrayed in this post  3) Three-charm-one-earwire earring, meaning you can have the three-earring-Zoro-look while only having one (1) jewel and one actual ear piercing opening hole thingy.   (English jewellery vocabulary is unknown to me, please correct where you can!)  ###&gt;☠&lt; *What will they cost?*  They will cost €2,50 ($3.20) per piece or, in a batch of three,  ~~€7,50 ($9.60)~~ *but* with a discount so €7,00 ($9.00). The three-in-one-earring will cost around the same, but a little less,  I'm thinking €6,50 ($8.40).  These prices exclude shipping cost, which will be €2,00 ($2.60) when shipped to Belgium and €3,00 ($3.90) when shipped anywhere else.

So I am more qualified to evaluate what it takes to collect geospatial data than most of the yahoos around here like you.  GIS on a scale like this is incredibly hard, and you can only collect so much data on your own without ground-truthing via millions of cell phone users who go into the field.  Lets say you want to get maps made from the comfort of your desk without enlisting the aid of cell phone users.  For example, if I want shapefiles of the roads to add to a geodatabase, naturally one first goes to the local city's website and looks for GIS data.  Maybe they have it, maybe they don't.  Maybe what they have is out of date because the city's budget cut back on their GIS department.  And most cities don't track the names of businesses at each place, they'll just tell you the zoning, but they won't tell you where the local Subway™ is.  Much of that data Apple is getting purely via TomTom (and Yelp maybe?).  So tell me, how do you get Google-quality data without using the crowdsourced corrections?

If you're going to be boring and talk about a domesticated animal, at least say the specific breed. Domestic cats, while superior to dogs, are an even more boring answer, because their breeds are so interwoven and, generally, aren't as readily imagined as dogs.  There are five categories to choose from:  1. Domestic/Boring (Dogs, Cats) 2. Livestock (Pigs, Cows, Scootaloo) 2. Quirky, but plausible. (Aardvarks, Tortoises, Squirrels) 3. Zoologist (Lions, Bears, Wildebeests, Dolphins) 3. Impossibly awesome. (The Alot)  For these sort of discussions, I prefer numbers three and five.

Thier passion truly took off when they purchased thier first set of turntables shortly after that and brought thier love for EDM to the next level. In 2005 they made the decision to branch out and move to the great city of Seattle, and now with all their networking and connections that they have made over the years, the McFunk Brothers have quickly become a very important part of Seattle's EDM culture and scene. Between DJing and working with Seattle's top production crews to help throw some of Seattle's finest events as Audio-Driveby Entertainment, these two most deffenetly have had thier hands full. In 2007 they decided to take thier passion to an even higher level when they both decided to start producing music.

t5_2r9tk,GospodinP,1348826176,"You've had a lot of people warn against the gun, so I'll let them speak to my unease there.  I think you're probably already familiar enough with gun safety to know your own feelings about how to responsibly enjoy a firearm.  You've had a lot of people suggest sensory deprivation, and at least one suggested a knife.  I'm going to tell you now how you can use them together for some highly traditional fear play.   **Um yes, SPOILERS: if you're a fear-play sub, this could spoil a moment for you ☺**  This is a trick as old as the initiation rites in fraternal orders, but it can really chill the blood:  Bind your play partner, play the role convincingly, and reveal some terrifying-looking knives.  Have fun with it, and when you think the moment is right, blindfold her.  Continue playing with the knives, and let the sound of the metal fill her experience.  Perhaps you could press the flat of a blade against her skin, but as always be safe (she can't see where the edge is, so you'll want to make sure she can't struggle into it!).  When you're ready to terrify her, pull out a piece of ice with a good corner/edge to it, and drag it across her flesh.  Make a satisfied groan or gasp as you do so: punctuate the moment with sound!  Strike a knife so the metal rings before or after!  Have fun with it!  She'll feel the edge of something cold, and then horror of horrors she'll feel *dripping*.  There won't be any pain, but she'll be convinced that she's just been sliced open.  The confusion here can build a mindfuck to intense levels.  At this point, if all has gone well, you can really make her believe she's about to be killed.  That said, it's all in how you play it and how familiar she is with this trick and all sorts of other things.  You say you're an educator, so I probably don't need to warn you about risks of fear play.  It sounds like she came to you with an understanding of what she wants, and you can decide for yourself if a ""trick"" like this would violate her trust in any way.  ",☺

t5_2qh3p,thomaswithoutkarenin,1348828149,"Let me share something with you. Years ago, I was with this girl; the sex was ok, little intense but nothing out of normal. Then she took a bottle of water, put some in her mouth and started putting her mouth in my penis (she really didn’t suck it). She basically moved her tongue around, and circulated the water top to bottom. Some of the cool water actually leaked down to my balls, which btw, was awesome. She did that for almost five minutes, and believe me, it was the best BJ I have ever had.   It baffled me for a while, and I asked her after we finished about her technique; she said that it took some time to learn how much water to put in her mouth, but the trick is to first drink a little to cool off her mouth, and then put a little more to do the BJ. Do not put too much.  Keep trying, whoever doesn’t appreciate your efforts to give a good bj, is a completely asshole and doesn’t deserve your attention to begging with. Good luck.

t5_2qzb6,pathjumper,1348848090,"&gt;Like many Wikileaks enthusiasts, this comes off incredibly paranoid and distrusting. Not that I don't feel the same re: the latter.  I entertain the thought that everyone is out to get me. That does not mean I accept as truth that everyone is out to get me.  &gt;It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it.   --Aristotle   &gt;It was the NYT's decision, ultimately, to publish or not publish certain information. If anything, it was self-censorship on NYT's part.  That was what I meant by censorship. NYT censored itself, or rather, cleared its stories with the Bush administration - reasons irrelevant - and chose not to publish information about the Bush administration. That, to me is *far* too cozy a relationship for a purported journalist organization to perform. Ever. Under any circumstances. It is their job to report the truth, not to report the truth that the authorities are comfortable with. For, if they don't, who will? The potential implications are almost too scary to contemplate.  &gt;I've heard Bill Keller talk about the Wikileaks saga at length and, for the most part, they withheld information that, to their judgment, would risk lives of American soldiers or sources/assets.  I have no issue with them exercising judgement. But that is not what they did. They consulted the Bush administration first. They asked daddy first. *That* is the issue.  In my opinion it is the hallmark of a Good™ journalist to piss off the *most powerful* people occasionally. It means they're doing their job. The checks &amp; balances we have in place (which are starting to fail, mind) are all well and good. But ultimately it is up to the people to check the government's power. But they can only do that if they know what the government is doing. And it is the press' job to diligently report the truth to them so that they can.   I have written off the NYT for their failure to do so. They did it once. Who really knows if they haven't already done it more? Or won't do it more in the future?   **tl;dr: As far as I am concerned, when they asked the Bush administration for advice on what to publish, they turned in their Journalist card.**",™

If you said no, they wouldn't hire you, or could fire you, or colleges could use that as a pretext for disciplinary proceedings, etc.  The new law says they can't even ASK.  **Even for private colleges!**  They can't ask for a user name or password or any other ""social media information"", and *they can't ask you to access it in their presence, either.*  These are short, well-formatted, and easy to read:  http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201120120SB1349&amp;search_keywords=  http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201120120AB1844&amp;search_keywords=  Unfortunately they do have an exception which may or may not be big enough to drive a truck through.

Basically this *would* reset things to how they were before social media, except back then this source of information didn't exist, so now you will look guilty automatically if you don't let them pick through your exculpatory social media accounts.  Basically this just gives peons another crumb to use for the few who can afford to sue, joining sex discrimination, racial discrimination, age discrimination, etc.  The employer ALWAYS says ""no we didn't make a decision because of THAT, it was this OTHER reason"", but now if you can convince a jury, you can add ""social media discrimination"" to that.

Who will Obama blame the recovery if we are UNlucky enough to have him for 4 more years. Ceertainly not on he, himself and the rest of his crooked henchmen.

t5_2rti0,KingContext,1348883850,"Yeah, my bad.   - from [guggenheim.org](http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/show-full/piece/?search=The%20Antipope&amp;page=&amp;f=Title&amp;object=76.2553.80)  &gt; The Antipope, December 1941–March 1942. Oil on canvas, 63 1/4 x 50 inches (160.8 x 127.1 cm). The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation,Peggy Guggenheim Collection, Venice  76.2553.80. © 2012 Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York/ADAGP, Paris More Works By Max Ernst  &gt;Max Ernst settled in New York in 1941 after escaping from Europe with the help of Peggy Guggenheim. The same year he executed a small oil on cardboard (now in the Peggy Guggenheim Collection) that became the basis for the large-scale The Antipope. When Guggenheim saw the small version, she interpreted a dainty horse-human figure on the right as Ernst, who was being fondled by a woman she identified as herself. She wrote that Ernst conceded that a third figure, depicted in a three-quarter rear view, was her daughter Pegeen; she did not attempt to identify another horse-headed female to the left.¹ When Ernst undertook the large version from December to March he changed the body of the “Peggy” figure into a greenish column and transferred her amorous gesture to a new character, who wears a pink tunic and is depicted in a relatively naturalistic way. The “Pegeen” figure in the center appears to have two faces, one of a flayed horse that looks at the horse-woman at the left. The other, with only its cheek and jaw visible, gazes in the opposite direction, out over the grim lagoon, like a pensive subject conceived by Caspar David Friedrich.  &gt;The great upheavals in Ernst’s personal life during this period encourage such a biographical interpretation. Despite his marriage to Guggenheim, he was deeply involved with Leonora Carrington at this time, and spent hours riding horses with her. As birds were an obsession for Ernst, so horses were for Carrington. Her identification with them is suggested throughout her collection of stories La Dame ovale, published in 1939 with seven illustrations by Ernst, two of which include metamorphosed horse creatures. It seems plausible that the alienated horse-woman of The Antipope, who twists furtively to watch the other horse-figure, represents a vision of Guggenheim. Like the triumphal bride in Attirement of the Bride, she wears an owl headgear. Her irreconcilable separation from her companion is expressed graphically by the device of the diagonally positioned spear that bisects the canvas. The features of the green totemic figure resemble those of Carrington, whose relationship with Ernst was to end soon after the painting was completed, when she moved to Mexico with her husband.  &gt;Lucy Flint  - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Ernst",©

First the Real Tone™ cable is some kind of ""special"" magic cable, then you're told it's just another USB DSP interface like all the others on the market, now you're saying it's magic because it's ""proprietary"". I'm sorry to be so blunt, but you don't know what you're talking about.  A DSP chip converts the analogue audio into a digital stream - the one in the Real Tone™ cable is no different to that in a [Behringer](http://www.gear4music.com/Recording-and-Computers/Behringer-UCG102-Guitar-Link/8CT) or that of [any other brand](http://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/Scarlett2i2/) of USB audio interface.  Once the digitised audio is in the computer - whether that computer happens to be a Intel compatible PC running Windows or OS X, or whether that computer happens to have a PowerPC chip and run a proprietary operating system like Sony's or the one in the Xbox - the Rocksmith software then calculates the frequency of the audio. A musical ""note"" is audio at a specific frequency.  The Rocksmith Real Tone™ cable might be faster than many other USB interfaces (according the the Rocksmith devs), but it is not functionally different. I'll bet that when Guitar Rising guys started working on the game they just bought a Behringer interface (or one they had kicking around the apartment) and used the Windows audio APIs.  I think you've done a fair bit of speculating about this, and it's really commendable that you like to think how stuff works, but you've come to some erroneous conclusions. Please don't speak about stuff you don't understand, and please don't take YouTube videos posted by the marketing departments of videogames companies as computer engineering gospel.

t5_2skou,strolls,1348900082,"There's a lot of, ahem, misinformation in this thread.  The Real Tone™ cable does not have magical ""note detection"" hardware - the note you play on the guitar does not enter the USB port of the console as an ""A"" or an ""E"".  All USB interfaces are functionally the same, and they all contain similar DSP chips.  There are a bunch of reasons that only the Real Tone™ cable is supported - Engineering Is Hard.  The Rocksmith devs claim the DSP chip in the Real Tone™ cable is a bit faster than that in many other audio interfaces. That may be important, but it's not somehow magic - the devs probably just tried a bunch of USB interfaces and picked the fastest.   When developing Rocksmith, the developers had to write drivers for the PS3 and Xbox. They did not want to have to write drivers for 50 other USB audio interfaces.   Having ported Rocksmith to the PC, the devs did not want to support 50 different kinds of cable. Let's say you buy the game and it doesn't work - they tell you to try with a different USB audio interface, you're gonna bitch about having to buy another piece of hardware.  Let's say the Rocksmith devs establish that your [Behringer](http://www.gear4music.com/Recording-and-Computers/Behringer-UCG102-Guitar-Link/8CT) interface is buggy with Rocksmith - how many hours do you want them to spend debugging that? And then how many hours do they spend debugging each the other brands and models of USB interface?  How many brands and models of USB interface should the Rocksmith have on their official [hardware compatibility list](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_compatibility_list)? How many $1000s should they allocate to supporting each one, considering the costs of software development and technical support.

t5_2qpaq,nbsdfk,1348917733,"I'll have a look around in my books. As far as I know it's legal to put as much as you want of it into food in the EU.    http://www.efsa.europa.eu/de/efsajournal/doc/163.pdf this paper by the EFSA about allowing a different crystal modification of Titandioxide, says they didn't find any toxicity even in extremely large doses of TiO2!  This paper http://nanosafety.ihep.ac.cn/2007/2007.19.pdf showed that nanoparticular TiO2 may have some adverse reactions, but that the normal &gt;100nm particles used in coatings and toothpaste have no toxicity at 5g/kg bodyweight. Which is an extremely large dose, considering that there are only a few tenth of mg in a coated tablet.   &gt;Abstract In order to evaluate the toxicity of TiO2 particles, the acute toxicity of nano-sized TiO2 particles (25 and 80 nm) on adult mice was investigated compared with fine TiO2 particles (155 nm). Due to the low toxicity, a fixed large dose of 5 g/kg body weight of TiO2 suspensions was administrated by a single oral gavage according to the OECD procedure. In 2 weeks, TiO2 particles showed no obvious acute toxicity. However, the female mice showed high coefficients of liver in the nano-sized (25 and 80 nm) groups. The changes of serum biochemical parameters (ALT/AST, LDH) and pathology (hydropic degeneration around the central vein and the spotty necrosis of hepatocytes) of liver indicated that the hepatic injury was induced after exposure to mass different-sized TiO2 particles. In addition, the nephrotoxicity like increased BUN level and pathology change of kidneys was also observed in the experimental groups. The significant change of serum LDH and alpha-HBDH in 25 and 80 nm groups showed the myocardial damage compared with the control group. However, there are no abnormal pathology changes in the heart, lung, testicle (ovary), and spleen tissues. Biodistribution experiment showed that TiO2 mainly retained in the liver, spleen, kidneys, and lung tissues, which indicated that TiO2 particles could be transported to other tissues and organs after uptake by gastrointestinal tract. © 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved. Keywords: Acute toxicity; Fixed dose procedure; Titanium dioxide; Nanoparticles; Mice     Since I could only find that TiO2 is allowed in food without limits in the EU, and studies with extremely high doses found that there was no toxicit and virtually no uptake, and that it is nearly completely insolluble.   Many coatings for industrial procession come premixed with TiO2, like Kollicoat IR white, which consists of Kollicoat IR, Kollidon VA 64, Kaolin, Titaniumdioxide and SDS.  And about the PVP: you might want to look into Copovidon (Kollidon VA 64) which is a Copolymer of Vinylpyrrolidon and Vinylacetate (6:4) that ist used in SR forms, because according to the ""Mäder - Weidenauer"" the VP gets dissolved and the VA just expands, creating pores that release the active substance in a controlled fashion.",©

t5_2qh03,JangSaverem,1348937086,"Actually I believe it comes from the fact that people will give money to ANYTHING online and Kickstarter projects are some of those things. What they dont realize is that people have taken the money and gone away with it. When someone doesnt reach their goal they keep the money and produce nothing or give a half assed project. Things that dont really deserve a huge amount somehow get popular with no merit and thus more people give more money while unpopular (by no reason other than not being noticed) get nothing. In her case she did a lot more. With the huge sum of money she got she could have been producing at a much faster rate but instead has this ""Late Fall/winter"" thing. When she needed $6k I suppose that was believable (but still a bit high in cash for that ""project"" of hers) when she got over $150k and still hasnt produced more than a couple ""ill get to it later"" updates people got mad. Then soon after she got the money she was in a room with towers of games which were likely purchased with a hefty amount of money. Games that may have nothing to do with the project. What it looked like is she just had someone use the money to buy a shit tone of game that may or may not have to do with the project [Here it is](http://imgur.com/ydCeL). Now, I suppose that could have a reason behind it but really what this all boils down to is that people dont know how to spend their money and gave a shit ton to some person online that actually has no obligation other than a Kickstarter project and a ""promise"" to do ANYTHING. What people are probably worried about or mad about is that she will either do NOTHING or produce a shitty half ass project not near meriting the money she got. ♠  If people had a brain in their head no one would have given money to her in the first place. She would probably just used the money the same way with more perks for herself and not said what was used on then produce videos that would regurgitate things from TvTropes, Blogs about feminism and the same stuff people have already heard but now said by her. It was a waste of cash in the first place but like I said, people will give their money to ANYHTING. ",♠

t5_mouw,Lord_Derp_The_2nd,1348953477,"&gt;A key advance in the science of graphene came when Andre Geim and Kostya Novoselov at Manchester University managed to extract single-atom-thick crystallites (graphene) from bulk graphite in 2004.[14] The Manchester researchers pulled out graphene layers from graphite and transferred them onto thin SiO2 on a silicon wafer in a process sometimes called micromechanical cleavage or, simply, the Scotch® tape technique. The SiO2 electrically isolated the graphene, and was weakly interacting with the graphene, providing nearly charge-neutral graphene layers. The silicon beneath the SiO2 could be used as a ""back gate"" electrode to vary the charge density in the graphene layer over a wide range.  &gt;The micromechanical cleavage technique led directly to the first observation of the anomalous quantum Hall effect in graphene,[84][119] which provided direct evidence of the theoretically predicted pi Berry's phase of massless Dirac fermions in graphene. The anomalous quantum Hall effect in graphene was reported around the same time by Geim and Novoselov and by Philip Kim and Yuanbo Zhang in 2005. These simple experiments started after the researchers watched colleagues who were looking for quantum Hall effect [204] and Dirac fermions [205] in bulk graphite.  &gt;Geim has received several awards for his pioneering research on graphene, including the 2007 Mott medal for the ""discovery of a new class of materials – free-standing two-dimensional crystals – in particular graphene"", the 2008 EuroPhysics Prize (together with Novoselov) ""for discovering and isolating a single free-standing atomic layer of carbon (graphene) and elucidating its remarkable electronic properties"", and the 2009 Körber Prize for ""develop[ing] the first two-dimensional crystals made of carbon atoms"". In 2008 and 2009, Reuters (which also runs a bibliometric service Web of Science) tipped him as one of the front-runners for a Nobel prize in Physics.[206] On October 5, 2010, the Nobel Prize in Physics for the year was awarded to Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov from the University of Manchester for their work on graphene.   20 years would seem a bit of an exaggeration.  Especially considering the term Graphene has only exisited for 25 years, and we didn't begin proof of concept work on the electrical possibilities until a few years ago.

t5_2qh1i,throwaway-098,1348955400,"Hello, I was diagnosed with schizophrenia about 10 years ago, and have had multiple serious episodes since then. My first episode was similar in character to the one you describe your husband experiencing. As things stand now, I am doing very well. I am in a wonderful relationship, have fulfilling work, many friends, and have not had an episode in several years.  As people here have said, every case is different, but I'll offer some of my experience and suggestions with the hope that they may be helpful.   First of all, there is a very good chance that when your husband is released he will not yet be well. When I was first released, I was still very delusional, though *much* better off than I had been at my admission. It took several more months of heavy meds for me to achieve something resembling 'normalcy'.  Second of all, meds suck. They really, really suck. They just suck alot less then winding up gibbering in the street and losing months and months to recovery. Ensure that your husband takes his meds, but be sympathetic that they have adverse effects. It takes a long time to find an effective treatment, and will probably require many rounds of experimenting with different drugs and dosages until he is both sane *and* comfortable.  When I was first hospitalized they put me on high dosages of several antipsychotics to get the episode under control. Once I was out, and feeling saner, I thought to myself ""Hey I got better... like I used to be! I don't need these shitty pills. I'm fine.""  And so I quit taking them. I didn't know anything about the disease at the time, and I didn't have anyone in my support network that did. The pills I was taking had me sleeping 14 hours a night, and dozing off in the middle of the day. My brain felt wrapped in cotton, there was a vague haze over everything. I didn't know that I should've stayed in a relationship with a doctor (not that I could've afforded to at that time, anyway) and worked towards adjusting my meds until they worked right. I was under the erroneous assumption that this was my prescribed ""new life"", and so I rejected the doctors and the treatment. Mistake.  I was alright for a while, kept my job, but eventually I started going off track again, cut down my hours, moved to the ghetto, eventually quit my job over some perceived slight, stopped eating, wound up crazy again. Ended up on SSI, moving to mom's, on new drugs this time. Got better. Moved back into the city, did the whole damn thing over again.  I think what finally brought me around was the third episode... you can only go for so long before denying you're sick. The third time around I ended up at my dad's house. He snuck meds into my food, and I got better. After I'd been better for awhile and decided to go back out on my own again, he broke the news to me that I'd been taking meds for months -- something which I thought I didn't need, and didn't want. I was upset for him for a little bit, but not long. I knew he was right. It also may have been luck. The drugs I received during each episode were different each time, and the drugs I take now are different from those as well. The med and dosage really depend on the individual patient.  -- and as I said, I'm doing very well now. I still have to be vigilant, and learning to accept the facts of the situation wasn't easy, but it has been worth it. Speaking as someone who's been through it, one thing that was very hard for quite a while is the memories. The things you experience during a psychotic break are not real things. They are unspeakably intense and hallucinations not merely in the 5 physical senses, but in all the subtle ranges of thought and emotion.... to experience them, they are realer than reality. They are hard to forget, and even after reaching a point where you can acknowledge they were not *real*, they stick with you as an obsessing memory, they are attractive in a way... it takes time to let them go. It takes time to rebuild, even after the meds are working. The aftermath of a break is a lonely and confusing time.  But for me, it got better. The things I wish I knew years ago were that finding the right meds and proper dosage takes a long time, and that I do need help -- I can't just grit my teeth and get through it, I need medication and a doctor's advice.  Best of luck to you both.  ☮",☮

You'll also discover that you'll have plenty of practice inserting IVs during your clinical rotation as a paramedic student.   EKG classes may be a good idea if you find it tough to grasp concepts in anatomy. I find that the quality of EKG training is variable amongst medic programs so you might want to ask a graduate of the program you're looking at to see if they were generally prepared for EKG interpretation.  Personally I think EKG training is good to have, although you could start off with something basic like the American Heart Association [Learn:® Rhythm Adult](http://www.onlineaha.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=main.courseCatalog) online program which is generally cheaper than taking a classroom course.

It depends on where the game draw the line at walk/run when pushing the stick up.   Alot of games I can run fine with my 360 controller, but alot I get the same problem here, so it's not just Dark Souls. Apparently you can click in on the left stick to fix it for a short while? (just read this before, haven't been home to try, apparently you don' have to hold down, just click once).   I beleive some 360 controllers the joystick maybe slightly off center meaning it does not move up as far as it should. If I go into the controller settings in windows and move the stick right up I notice the wee X does not hit the top of the box like it does moing it the other directions.    Two ways to combat this I think those of us with the ♥♥♥♥ty controllers can either:  a: use software to slightly adjust the maximum distance for the joystick to have to move up to hit full range   b: unscrew the controller and just file down the top of the casing enough to be able to move the stick up just that litle bit more     Anyway I could be wrong but this is the impression I have. I remember having this problem with my same controller with a few other 3rd person games in the past.   What im saying is don't rage quit dark souls just yet, I don't think it's the games fault. If what I read is correct and all it takes is a click on the left stick then it won't really matter anyway. I look forward to going home and trying it.""  .

Having worked as a developer on a few music games, pitch/note detection is tricky stuff to get right for one note, let alone six strings at once. Limiting the potential hardware is a wise move on the development side, but it's also a bit of a buzzkill on the customer side when you need to buy extra hardware. However, at least by purchasing their cable, you're pretty much guaranteed that the game will work out of the box, and you likely won't have to screw around with drivers or other hardware issues.  Hopefully they'll issue a patch one day that opens the game up for advanced users (or at least ones that are willing to deal w/ driver issues &amp; other headaches) that will allow use of more than just the Real Tone™ cable. If that were the case, I'd buy the game again for PC, just so I could play during lunch breaks at work, and didn't have to pack my RT cable around with me.",™

Sept 20th is the verified date.  http://digitallife.today.com/_news/2012/09/20/13989898-the-emoticon-is-30-years-old?lite   &gt;Many people have denounced the very idea of the smiley face, pointing out that good writers should have no need to explicitly label their humorous comments. Shakespeare and Jonathan Swift and Mark Twain got along just fine without this. And by labeling the remarks that are not meant to be taken seriously, we spoil the joke. In satirical writing, half the fun is in never being quite sure whether the author is serious or not.  &gt;To a large degree, I agree with these critics. Perhaps the E-mail smiley face has done more to degrade our written communication than to improve it. But in defense of the idea, let me say two things:  &gt;First, not all people who post on boards have the literary skill of Shakespeare or Twain, and even those luminaries had bad days. If Shakespeare were tossing off a quick note complaining about the lack of employee parking spaces near the Globe Theater, he might have produced the same kind of sloppy prose that the rest of us do. Besides, Shakespeare’s work is full of clichés and his spelling was atrocious. :-)  &gt;Second, and more important, these authors were publishing their words in a different medium, with different properties. If 100,000 copies of a novel or an essay were distributed in printed form, and if 1% of the readers didn’t get the joke and were outraged at what they had read, there was nothing these clueless readers could do to spoil the enjoyment of the other 99%. But if it were possible for each of the 1000 clueless readers to write a lengthy counter-argument and to flood these into the same distribution channels as the original work, and if others could then jump into the fray in similar fashion, you can see the problems that this would cause. If the judicious use of a few smilies can reduce the frequency of such firestorms, then maybe it’s not such a bad idea after all. Again, we’re talking here about casual writing on the Internet, not great works printed in one-way media that relatively inaccessible to the general public.   💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩  (*☻-☻*)  :-( ",💩

t5_2srnv,ForgottenPhoenix,1348972793,"Based on your other responses and the fact that you are getting dense, fast growing culture with normal colony growth, I have a strong suspicion that it is a contamination issue. Something else that is resistant to AMP may be growing in your media.  You can test this fairly easily though:  - Do a quick and dirty miniprep without the kit and without adding RNAse([protocol here^♦ ^see ^below](http://hg.wustl.edu/hdk_lab_manual/plasmid/plsmid05.html)).  Once you purify the plasmid, run it uncut on the gel.  Typically, both RNA and DNA will be quite bright on the gel ([something like this](http://i.imgur.com/4JPzn.jpg)); however, IF you have a contamination with something else, RNA will be a LOT brighter and the DNA bands will be fairly weak because you will have very low yield of plasmid^♦♦ .     If you see that on the gel, it is a tell-tale sign of a contamination; and since you are taking all the precautions, its possible that the stock cells are contaminated.  ♦ Increase the centrifugation time for steps 5, 6 and 7 to 5 minutes each. Also, it is critical that you omit the addition of RNAse in step 8 otherwise this won't work the way we want it to. Resuspend the pellet in TE and run a small aliquot (5ul should be enough) on the gel.  ♦♦ Since contaminated cells will still release RNA and won't have the plasmid, we can exploit this. I have seen this happen before in a contaminated culture and if you want to post a gel picture (or PM me a link), I can look at it and let you know.  Also, if you have another culture that is known to give normal plasmid yields, use the same method to purify the plasmid so that you can compare them side by side on the gel.  The reason it works this way is because the cells that have plasmid grow slower than the ones without plasmid, therefore, the ratio of the cells in the media is skewed against the cells containing plasmid.   I hope this helps.  Feel free to message me if you need any clarification or have further questions.     ",♦
