t5_2qh2p,on_that_note,1341101933,"I dunno man,  &gt; Schizophrenia (/ˌskɪtsɵˈfrɛniə/ or /ˌskɪtsɵˈfriːniə/) is a mental disorder characterized by a breakdown of thought processes and by poor emotional responsiveness. It most commonly manifests itself as auditory hallucinations, paranoid or bizarre delusions, or disorganized speech and thinking, and it is accompanied by significant social or occupational dysfunction.  I would say that screencap reflects the following:  1. Auditory Hallucinations  2. Paranoid/ bizarre delusions ✔  3. Disorganized speech/thinking ✔  I would say 2/3 is close enough to suggest a ""touch"" of schizophrenia  ;)  **edit: I am not a doctor and have very little knowledge on neuropathology so take this with a grain of salt.**",✔

t5_2qv8g,rageagainsthevagene,1341115471,"#I posted the link on my facebook wall before reading these comments and pulled out that EXACT quote. Here's what I had to say (read: rant) about it.  In one story, ""Sarah's height projection is 190cm (6'3""). That's the conclusion of our tests. Obviously that's a body size that a girl can't be happy with."" says Sarah's doctor who is intentionally stunting her growth via orthopedic injections.  This...is horrifying. I feel like I had really low self esteem about being tall in high school. Was I picked on for it? Sure, but who isn't picked on for something or another? But seriously, telling an adolescent girl that she needs to stop growing or forever be a freak? Does not compute. There's seriously something wrong with that. I mostly grew out of my issues with my height after venturing out into the world ... upon discovering: WHO CARES? Being tall is actually one of the things that makes me unique. Someone can't handle that? That sounds like their problem.  There's another line in the trailer from a woman (the filmmaker I think?) that goes, ""When people talk about how it's hard to be a tall woman, they're not talking about every day stuff, it's really not the end of the world. What is the end of the world is that you're single and alone.""  Wait .... ..... what??  I can't tell if this movie is just a documentary-style piece that shadows a few central ladies or if it's actually a statement that being tall sucks. If the latter, these women need to stop hiding behind the length of their shadows and step up to the challenge of feeling empowered by the things that make them unique. I wouldn't change my height given the choice. It reminds me most of my family. ♥  edit: because nazis",♥

t5_2qh33,EvanRWT,1341117407,"I like the general idea of the packaging, but not the execution.  The good thing is that it makes it easy for people to pick out which medication they need. Put the symptoms before the name of the medication, because people know what symptoms they're having. They don't always know what medicine treats those symptoms.  But there's a lot of bullshit they're selling too.  For example, their ""help! I have a stuffy nose"" medicine says:  *Help I have a stuffy nose contains 16 uncoated and uncolored phenylephrine tablets. Phenylephrine will take care of your nasal congestion, but it won’t really do much else. We think that’s a good thing. Many companies like to combine 2 and 3 and more different drugs to treat multiple broad conditions, instead of specific symptoms. Help® prefers to treat only the specific symptom you would like to treat. This way hopefully, you will better understand exactly what you are taking and what you are taking it for.*  This is silly. It's not intrinsically better to take single medications nor is it better to combine. You need to treat the symptoms, all of them. Usually, you won't just have a stuffy nose, your head may feel stuffy too. You may have a dull ache in the head, or feel a general malaise, not feeling well. In that case, you definitely should go for a combination of phenylephrine with ibuprofen or acetaminophen. There are a dozen such combinations at your local pharmacy. Or single versions of all of those medications. Pick what suits the symptoms.  On the same note, I see this line prominently displayed on a whole bunch of their medications:  *contains 16 uncoated and uncolored tablets*  They're making out like uncoated and uncolored tablets are better. They come right out and say it:  *Help® thinks there are good moments for candy and good moments for drugs. But it’s probably best for the candy and best for the drugs if you keep those moments separate. Help I have an aching body is 16 white ibuprofen pills that haven’t been coated in sugar, or dyed candy apple red.*  That's from their ibuprofen packaging. Again, it's bullshit. Doctors have been sugar coating pills for a century. There is no virtue to bad tasting medicine. It won't make you feel better any faster. Adding half a gram of sugar to make it more palatable, or a bit of food coloring to make it prettier is not wrong.  Sometimes, not doing these things can even hurt. For example, their ""help! I have chest congestion!"" contains 200 mg of guaifenesin. Again, uncoated and uncolored. You're supposed to take 1-2 tablets every 4 hours. The regular store equivalent would be something like Mucinex, which has 600 mg of guaifenesin, but it's slow-release coated so you only take a tablet every 12 hours. Why the hell would someone want to take a tablet every 4 hours when you could take it every 12 hours instead, just by coating appropriately?  Many drugs have enteric coatings, for example aspirin. It's a stomach irritant, and the coating simply makes it acid resistant so it dissolves in the intestine instead of the stomach, saving the stomach from needless irritation. Why not have such a coating?  It's like they're trying to sell the new-agey ""no additives! pure and natural!"" line to justify their extremely high price. But that logic is unsound.",®

t5_2qu5n,masqueradestar,1341152002,"My gut reaction is ""heh, that's vaguely nerdy and cute"" followed quickly by ""why do lump all of your relationships into ranked categories when you're trying to break away from hierarchies?"" and ""a lot of stuff in these categories is downright unhealthy"". And while lumping everyone into such strict categories seems suboptimal to me anyway, you're not dodging ""the sticky issue of hierarchy"" by still having a hierarchy.  Different strokes for different folks, but frankly, having partners with ""no input/no say"" (as in 1 bond) seems manipulative at best. You require your partners to earn the ability to make their opinions on your relationship(s) worthwhile? ""You tell them what the deal is and expect them to handle [it]""? Huge red flags for me.  Additionally, even people who are just friends with benefits or similar shouldn't be ""no info"", in my opinion; if you're physically intimate with them, they have some stake in the other people you're physically intimate with, and I see few if any compelling reasons to deliberately withhold that information (or, say, the fact that you're in a primary fluid-bonded relationship, or other similar things) from them.  &gt; Does anyone see any merit in this? I thought it rather helpful, especially for ensuring that everyone is on the same page about the level of investment of everyone involved.  I'm generally a very big proponent of Whatever Works For You™, but it seems healthier to negotiate the boundaries of your relationships with the person/people involved, instead of referring them to a graph.  &gt; the traditional hierarchical model of primary, secondary and tertiary (which is the idea that you can only have one of each and thus the mono concept that only ONE person can be the most important is still held)  Is this even a thing, a ""traditional"" model of poly that implies you can only have one of... anything?

I take it you're just starting out in OpenGL, and want to make sure you're doing it the Right Way™. While this is a commendable aspiration, you're jumping the gun in a big way.  Go back to whatever tutorial you have, and keep reading. If you're not following a tutorial, the sidebar is there for you.  In direct answer to your question, the implementation is Host side, what API you are using matters naught, ancient OpenGL 1 code will work perfectly on every modern OpenGL *implementation*. OpenGL is designed in such a way that there is not an ""OpenGL 4 interface"", there is simply ""OpenGL"", some things are blessed in OpenGL 4, some are not. The vendor is expected to figure out the inbetween details.  Start coding, it will throw a sensibly worded error message if you do something no-one was expecting. Or it will crash.  pyglet and pyOpenGL are interchangeable, *there can be only one* OpenGL, and to that end, the following code works fine...      pyglet.begin()         ...     pyopengl.end()  A very OpenGL 1 example there, but I'm yet to encounter a single platform that supports OpenGL 4 but does not support mixing those GL4 commands into a typical GL1 loop.",™

Trying to get you suspended from school, or lower marks because you have deliberate mistakes in an essay is not a positive way to Dominate someone who has put their trust in a Dominant. He should build you up in ways that have you succeed in your goals. Just because you are submissive to someone does not give them the right to get you in trouble, academically or otherwise. You were younger, and it was your first experience, but please be careful in how much you allow yourself to give up, at least till you completely trust that you are safe from harm in any way.  Secondly...you don't mention how much time you've allowed yourself and the other people to establish any common ground. Sure there are going to be first impressions that won't be good (trust your first instinct) but sometimes it takes time to establish what you may find you actually need. Like zil-horrorshow said, time may be needed by both parties. And that's not a bad thing at all.  Just like there's no perfect man/woman, there's no perfect Dominant. Preconceived notions will always lead to disappointment. Take the advice given by zil, it's really smart counsel.  There's no ""instant soup"" when it comes to ANY relationship; in a D/s relationship, there has to be deeper soul searching in order to establish whether that level of trust is possible.

Once your load meets a certain minimum acceptable level of expansion and penetration you don't gain a whole lot. 38 Special meets that minimum level of performance, especially in +P loadings, so I don't understand why you would load up with something that will be significantly harder to control for little to no gain.  Then again I don't really understand why you wouldn't just go get a Glock 17 to use instead.",™

t5_2qzb6,ObligatoryResponse,1341264116,"Facebook has had events from the start. Your argument was ""Of course it's slower; it does more and keeps parity with the desktop site"" (paraphrased).  That's not valid justification. It can't do a number of things (link previews, events, probably more) that the mobile app and desktop site can both do, and everything it does interactively, it does poorly (every click takes significantly longer, many tasks require multiple extra clicks). None of the things it does poorly interactively are even remotely related to the things it does well in the background (contact sync, notifications). That is: syncing my contacts periodically throughout the day shouldn't effect how long it takes someones profile to load when I click their name.  No, I'm not suggesting that Sync and Notifications are used less than creating events. But I am suggesting that there's no excuse for a feature that's been part of Facebook's website from the start to be left out of the mobile app. And I'm also suggesting that Events, one of the things Facebook excels at, is a commonly enough used feature that ignoring it in the mobile app is a Bad Idea™.  &gt;We're talking core functionality vs. minor features.   Yes. The core functionality is all the things the desktop website does. You wouldn't leave off posting to someone's wall, would you?  &gt;Google+ &lt;i&gt;just&lt;/i&gt; added events. They had notifications and contact syncing from the start.  Irrelevant. Google+ just added events PERIOD. Their mobile app and mobile website got events as soon as they were added to desktop. And interactivity is *better* in the Google+ app than the Google+ mobile site. So there goes your argument that sync and notifications justifies it being painfully slow... Don't compare Google+ to Facebook in a usability discussion.",™

Nothing is being done to fix this and the problem is getting worse  These anti psychotic medications, if you will simply please read the articles from the CBC and the WSJ instead of hiding your head in the sand, were never approved in the first place for the elderly in any drug testing by the FDA or Health Canada. In fact the FDA has always specifically recommends against use of these medications on dementia patients as have with a wink and a nod the drug companies, even though the drug manufacturers know full well the billions they make in profits from this use.    The State of New York Attorney General won a multi million dollar fine on one of the manufacturers for knowingly marketing these drugs to doctors for ""off label"" use on dementia patients, which amounted to a drop in the bucket of the profits these companies make on these drugs.  All use of these drugs in the elderly has always been ""off label"" right from the start.  example:  http://www.risperdal.com/safety.html  ""IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR RISPERDAL ®  Elderly Patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with atypical antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death compared to placebo. RISPERDAL ® (risperidone) is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis. ""  Yet this drug is one of the most widely prescribed of all drugs, even more than heart or diabetes medication, for dementia patients according to the Wall Street journal.  The fact that this drug and others like it are in massive use in nursing homes to chemically restrain the patients from wandering around bothering the nurse's beauty sleep has been known about by government, by the medical associations and the drug manufactures for decades.  My choice not to eat an animal like a lobster that looks appetizingly like a giant mosquito and makes its living on the ocean floor scavenging for dead and decaying fish droppings is my business. And slavery was abolished by the Jewish courts thousands of years ago, and in any event the slavery laws in the Torah were extremely progressive for the time, 3000 years ago,  forbidding murder, injury or mistreatment of slaves, and allowing them to be periodically freed.

El asesor especial de la Presidencia de la República brasileña para asuntos internacionales, Marco Aurelio García, aseguró que el gobierno brasileño no ejerció presión para que Venezuela fuese incluida en el bloque, como había sugerido el canciller Luis Almagro.  ""Eso no corresponde al estilo de la política externa brasileña y menos todavía al de la presidenta Dilma"", dijo García en declaraciones recogidas por el diario Folha de Sao Paulo.  La declaración fue hecha como consecuencia de las declaraciones de Luis Almagro, quien afirmó que ""no está dicha la última palabra"" sobre el ingreso de Venezuela, y que el presidente terminó aceptando la propuesta de Venezuela como una muestra de “realpolitik”. El vicepresidente Danilo Astori también se manifestó en contra del ingreso, calificándolo de ""muy negativo"".  García fue más allá, y afirmó que la decisión de incluir a Venezuela en el bloque fue propuesta por José Mujica y acatada por los demás países. Folha asegura que el político brasileño habló este lunes con Mujica y que el presidente uruguayo confirmó este posicionamiento favorable a Venezuela.  ""Fue una decisión unánime y una decisión que reflejó un consenso político"", afirmó García, quien además aseguró que Brasil no presionaría de esa manera a gobiernos ""con los que tenemos una asociación tan íntima"" como Uruguay y Argentina.  Además, el jerarca brasileño reafirmó la posición del gobierno brasileño de no imponerle sanciones económicas a Paraguay.  También Argentina. También en la noche del lunes, la cancillería argentina emitió un comunicado en el que si bien no es tan explíctico como García, deja en claro que “el ingreso de Venezuela como miembro pleno del Mercosur fue una decisión unánime de los presidentes de la Argentina, Brasil y Uruguay durante la Cumbre de Mendoza”.  “El día viernes, luego de una reunión de Dilma Rouseff, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner y José Mujica, donde escucharon las posiciones de sus cancilleres y los asesores jurídicos de los gobiernos de Brasil y la Argentina, los presidentes resolvieron el ingreso de la República Bolivariana de Venezuela en una reunión a solas. El análisis de los asesores legales presentes también fue unánime en que el ingreso de Venezuela cumple estrictamente con los tratados del Mercosur y las legislaciones nacionales de los países partes”, prosigue el texto.  “La resolución aprobando el ingreso fue consensuada entre los cancilleres de las tres países y los asesores jurídicos y aprobada por los presidentes”, agrega el texto, que también, sin  nombrarlo, descarta la hipótesis que mencionó el canciller Almagro, de que el ingreso venezolano al bloque aún no está decidido.  “La ceremonia de ingreso se llevará a cabo el 31 de  Julio próximo en la ciudad de Río de Janeiro con la presencia de los presidentes de Argentina, Uruguay, Brasil y Venezuela”, cierra el texto.",©

t5_2s75q,tehnomad,1341289513,"From the FAQ:  &gt;I use the TrueSkill™ ranking system to estimate player skills. It's similar to the commonly-used Elo system, but is more advanced in that it explicitly models the uncertainty about each player's skill, can handle games of more than two players, and can handle games where teams of players compete [though of course that's not needed for Dominion]. (Thanks to user rspeer for introducing me to TrueSkill and producing some interesting rankings based on the data prior to adding registration, which you can see here.) In a nutshell: skill is measured on a scale that goes from roughly 0 to 50 points. (Actually skill can be any number, but 99.8% of players should fall in the 0–50 range.) The skill range column is a 99.8% confidence interval — the system is 99.8% sure your true skill lies somewhere in that range. New players are assigned a skill of ""25 ± 25"", which is to say, we don't really have any idea what that person's skill is. As you play more, your mean skill moves up or down and the range gets smaller as the system believes it has a better estimate of your skill.  &gt; The level column is the low end of your range, rounded down to an integer and clamped to the range [0, 50]. If we ignore the clamping, it is a conservative skill estimate in the sense that we are 99.9% confident that you are at least that skillful.  &gt; Because Dominion has a lot of randomness (it's not uncommon for a low-skill player to beat a high-skill player, through fortunate shuffling), it takes a relatively long time to change your skill — the system needs to see a lot of examples of you winning before it accepts that it's not just due to luck. (For those interested in the details, I've set β = 25, γ = σ0 / 100 (applied daily), and the draw probability at 5%.)  Governor is a promo card.",™

You also get Extended warranty with the purchase (so they give you theft tracking software via lojack, and accidental damage warranty). If you end up with a Dell, I HIGHLY suggest making the purchase via Dell.com/Berkeley so you can take advantage of the added benefits.  That being said. There arent many Dell laptops suggestions I can make in 12-14 inch range. The closest thing is the Alienware M14x, which is on student special, but costs $1274+tax.  If you are willing to go the 15 inch route, there are some laptops, but for a budget of $1000 with the promo card, the best I can do is Intel 4000 graphics.

You will never be BBB. It is not possible to alter your innate sex. Finding out you are BBB later does not change your sex, it simply means you were wrong about being AAA. You were still always BBB from the start.  If you are some exotic sex at birth, you will always be that exotic sex. Furthermore, there is absolutely a baseline for what is purely male and what is purely female.   You are trying to make this about changing the identification of a persons sex, when it is about changing the innate sex they were born with. Sex is still, with the exception of extreme anomalies, a binary system. There are males and females. It is determined by your function. You either can, or should be able to, give birth to a child. Or, you can, or should, be able to provide you seed to fertilize an egg. It is that simple. A person with AIS is biologically still male, even if they are technically women. They cannot have a child. They do not have ovaries.   You are attempting to descend into a realm where sex has literally no meaning. I could be female just because I said so, and that is not science.   I could also say Abraham Lincoln is technically alive, depending on your definition of alive, but I'm going to avoid the logical fallacies and continue with my original argument and pray you see the fault in your reasoning.  &gt; Having a working dick/male reproductive system, or having a vagina/female reproductive system, does not make someone male OR female, its a incomplete diagnosis. You need more information.  Then what is the point of identifying someone's sex?    Here, we'll make this easier for you. The definition of *male*: A male (♂) organism is the physiological sex that produces sperm. It is that simple. We simply understand there are people within this group that should be able to produce sperm, but are unable to. For example a male who had his testes removed for any reason.  **If you could not produce sperm or eggs at birth, you never will. You.cannot.change.this.**  &gt; Having a period or being able to birth a child, does not make you female, and I'm talking Sex here.  Are you suggesting the mother whose egg you came from, because there is no way around having a mother at some stage of the game, could actually have been male? If you are attempting to assert that I'm sure the medical field would absolutely love to meet you and your male mother, because this has never happened, and never will.  I hate to descend into a straw man, but if this is what you are attempting to assert you are an idiot.",♂

Then in last year of high school a lot of my friends were going veg for environmental reasons and I was like ""lol, you fools."". Then they actually challenged me with real arguments, and sure I could laugh at them all I wanted for going veg but I don't turn down a debate (especially didn't in high school). And being the big debater I was I hated it when people just stick to their points because they feel strongly about something or whatever (without any valid arguments), so surely enough when I ran out of arguments I went vegetarian. It really was that ""easy"" for me, even though I loved meat before that it just wasn't defendable from an environmental point of view.  Eventually I somehow reasoned vegetarian was too expensive, I think mostly because I was too lazy to cook properly and it resulted in me eating lots of fastfood or frozen food from the store. So I rationalised that maybe I'll go veg again after graduating.  Then after about a year of non-vegetarianism I got into it on moral grounds again (not environmental, I'm not very environmentalist anymore even though I see it as a bonus) and still going strong after about 8 or 9 months. Had no difficulties sticking to it whatsoever this time (had fish like three times but lots of seafood, I kind of see shrimps and oysters as insects so they don't matter to me at all).  Oh, and before my 2nd veg coming (I tried out vegan first so veg actually isn't wrong!) I was really into sausages as I had found a place selling polish ones (my mother's polish, so I have a lot of sausage eating from my childhood). However even with that it really wasn't a hard transition. I don't mind people seeing my effort to turn veg/pesc as some grandiose feat. but rather than that I'd prefer it if they just saw how simple it is and decided to try it out themselves. ♥",♥

t5_2r9po,TopherX,1341405078,"Having a broken Mousewheel sucks for gaming, yes. And that fact isn't enough to justify buying a new one. But it also sucks for webpage navigation, Document editing, and pretty much anything you do on the computer.  So, even though you don't really need a new mouse to do all of the above, you will be severely handicapped doing even the most basic functions of your computer without a functional mousewheel.  Now,  The the questions you need to ask is this.   Why do you NOT need a new mouse?     A: Is it money issues?  B: Is it that your computer has the old PS/2 port and no USB?    C: Is your current mouse a high end mouse and you simply do not want to replace it?   D: Is it a combination of any of these?  If it's A and B. Ask some one if they have an extra mouse laying around. Chances are you know someone who probably does.  Hell I have a dozen mice just laying around at my place, and I've been known to just give them away.  I actually just gave away a 70 dollar gaming mouse. (Granted, I have multiple computers, and have been building computers for well over 15 years, so having extra peripherals just laying around aren't unusual for me)    If it's C, email your mouses manufacturer. If it's in warranty or not, some companies will help you regardless.  I know Logitech and Razr have replaced old keyboards and mice for me even though they were out of warranty.     Actually Logitech replaced an old Discontinued Internet Navigator™ Keyboard (They stopped making these in 2000 I believe?) when the wheel scroll broke on mine.     **TL;DR There is no reason not to get a replacement mouse. There are many options out there**",™

First of all, the game looks simply amazing. Could possibly the most fun/realistic racing game out there. Been watching videos of the game ever since it came out, but never had the chance to actually try it out. I'm a regular go-kart racer(nothing professional, just for fun) and I really enjoy anything related to racing! This game looks like a must-try, and I'd very much enjoy playing it more than anything.  * **Best racing moment:** Well, it's not from a game but surely is the best moment of my racing time. Racing on a go-kart track with 8 friends. It's raining lightly, and the track is extremely slippery. Entering the final round, in 3rd place. I'm really close to the 2nd place, and about to take out on the following turn. I take the turn inside, and force the other guy to take a long turn. Because of the slippery floor, he spins out of the race. (He's not harmed) I'm in 2nd place, closing in on the 1st place as we approach a final turn. About 2 meters between us.  As my friend was taking a safe turn, I was driving mad to get to the first place.  I approach the turn from the outside, and make a sharp turn inside the road. I drift with all the speed I have, as I can't afford slowing down. 50 meters away from the finish line. With all the water splashing out of my rear wheels, I safely drift my way out of the turn and get back on the track safely. My friend watching me from behind, I cross the finish line in first place. *Simply the best moment of my racing time.*  Again, thank you for this amazing PiF! :)",✔

t5_2qim4,grbgout,1341493272,"Thanks for the link, I look forward to learning from it.  The point of targetting OpenCL is that you don't (shouldn't) need to explicitly target each GPU vendor's particular GPGPU implementation: CUDA for nVidia, APP for AMD (ATI), and who knows what for Intel. The performance, then, is inherently dependent upon each vendor's implementation (how true to the spec) of OpenCL.  Specifically regarding nVidia; [OpenCL nVidia Developers Zone](http://developer.nvidia.com/opencl):   &gt; OpenCL™ (Open Computing Language) is a low-level API for heterogeneous computing that runs on CUDA-powered GPUs. Using the OpenCL API, developers can launch compute kernels written using a limited subset of the C programming language on a GPU.  That means developers (Blender devs, game developers, etc) can target OpenCL, and not have to worry about what hardware the end-user actually has: if they target only CUDA, or APP, then their product is only fully functional for those end-users who have devices with such capabilities available.  I want to say it's analogous to OpenGL versus DirectX, but it really isn't.  It's more like if every GPU manufacturer had their own implementation akin to OpenGL/DirectX, each with its own name, and varying compatability with the OpenGL/DirectX standard(s).  You're probably aware of that, though.  **Edit**: Maybe the issues here regarding Cycles is AMD having a poor implementation of the OpenCL specification: or, more to the point, a poor mapping of the OpenCL specification to their proprietary GPGPU implementation.",™

I have been to other LDS funerals, however, where the deceased was a family member of someone important (like a stake president's family member) and the funeral was entirely different, more like a traditional Protestant funeral in which the majority of the time is spent sharing thoughts of the departed.  I served in several bishoprics and it seems like at least every year or so we would get some official reminder that the PURPOSE of a funeral was to share the Plan of Salvation™ and that we should always be sure that the missionaries were in attendance, because no doubt there would be non-member friends and family members present.

In the war with Mexico he fought a pistol duel with his commanding officer.  He manged to kill thousands of Indians by hurling them against Lincolns' army, after he won the battle he manged to lose all his gains in the counterattack. (He was Americas chief Indian negotiator. his actions killed more Indians than any man that ever lived.)  He's the only confederate officer to be pardoned after the Civil War.  He's the only confederate officer to have an outdoor statue of himself in Washington DC. (At the foot of ""judiciary Hill"".)

Google ""Albert Pike, 3 world wars"" and LOL at the Ashkenazi (Converts to ""Jew"") Jews, and why they are being allowed to act as the they have.  See:http://www.threeworldwars.com/albert-pike2.htm  TL;DR: The war must be conducted in such a way that Islam (the Moslem Arabic World) and political Zionism (the State of Israel) **mutually destroy each other**.   Q: If you had not one racist bone in your body, what would a ""race"" have to do to you, for you to want to kill that ""race""?  A: What ever your answer... TKS! That is exactly what they need to do to get this ball rolling!  *PS: Any talk about a ""new religion"" is code for ""science"".*    ☹  http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/khazars1.asp (That's from Fordham University) There were a few Israelites and the king and subjects of a huge powerful kingdom was to convert to one of three religions en-mass, and were tricked into not converting to ""Israelites"" but converting to ""Jews"" (Notice how the king was corrected about the difference by the Christin):  &gt;On the third day he called all the sages together and said to them. ""Speak and argue with one another and make clear to me which is the best religion."" They began to dispute with one another without arriving at any results until the King said to the Christian priest ""What do you think? Of the religion of the Jews and the Muslims, which is to be preferred?"" The priest answered: ""The religion of the Israelites is better than that of the Muslims.""   &gt;The King then asked the kadi [a Muslim judge and scholar]: ""What do you say? Is the religion of the Israelites, or that of the Christians preferable?"" The kadi answered: ""The religion of the Israelites is preferable.""   &gt;Upon this the King said: ""If this is so, you both have admitted with your own mouths that the religion of the Israelites is better Wherefore, trusting in the mercies of God and the power of the Almighty, I choose the religion of Israel, that is, the religion of Abraham.  But they still even today use their Babylonian Talmud.  And so that brings me to this: Revelation 2:9.

And you can compare the rhetoric of anarchists and libertarians, because both primarily accuse the state of being the primary obstacle on the way towards true freedom™. To understand how ridiculous that comparison is, you have to know that for anarchists, freedom means *from the shackles of capitalism*, and that libertarians define freedom as the freedom of capitalism *from the shackles of the state*.  Comparing SRS with radfems because """"But what about teh menz!"" equals ""Oh no, twanzphobia!"" just shows that you argue out of *ignorance*. Okay, both statements basically say that a form of gender oppression isn't real. The similarities end here. Men can usually be found on the very top on the pyramid of gender relations, while transgendered people can usually be found at the bottom.  One can argue about the exact extent of the power difference between the male and the female gender, but it takes a healthy dose of ignorance to deny it's existence altogether. On the other hand, I'm completely lost trying to understand why radfems think that the shit transgendered  have to endure is imaginary.

The rock and the fisherman are connected through the curve of the fishing rod, which obviously has a lot of movement, another important concept in composition. The man is looking at the end of the fishing rod, which makes it the main point of interest. There is an implied horizontal line between the man's eyes and the rock, which introduces stability and rigidity. Also, there is a triangular shape formed the top and bottom of the man and the rock, which also contributes to the rigidity of the composition. The longer you look at it, the better it gets.  The color scheme is muted and fairly neutral, with the man and the line of his fishing rod as the only color accents. The detail in the shadows and highlights is remarkable. This is what gives the photo its painterly quality. The dynamic range of this scene is not extreme, but you will probably have to capture it using several exposures. Furthermore, the atmospheric effects in the background contribute a lot to the depth and realism of this photo.  It wouldn't be hard to achieve such a look with a few Adobe® Photoshop® adjustment layers. Lower the global saturation, add contrast using an S-curve and use 'selective color' or 'color balance' to add a bit of blue into the shadows. You may want to combine different exposures using separate layers and layer masks. There may be a lot more to it depending on the original footage, but this should definitely push you in the right direction.  One word of caution: doing this kind of post production on an flawed photograph without a strong composition or color scheme isn't going to get you anywhere. Your photo has to be solid on the most fundamental level before the eye and brain will consider it being any good.",®

t5_2snuc,jez2718,1341523970,"◊ and □ symbolize 'possibly' and 'necessarily', '~' symbolizes 'not', P→Q symbolizes ""If P then Q"" and '↔' symbolizes ""if and only if"".  In words what I wrote is:   Axiom 1 ""(if P then Q) if and only if (if not-Q then not-P)""  Axiom 2 ""A is possible if and only if A isn't necessarily false""  ""If A is possibly false then A is necessarily possibly false"" (S5)  ""If A isn't necessarily possibly false then A isn't possibly false"".  ""If not necessarily not necessarily A then necessarily A""  ""If possibly necessarily A then necessarily A"" which is Plantinga's S5 ____________________________________________________________________________ To explain, by S5 we can say ""If A is possibly false then A is necessarily possibly false"". By using the first axiom I can reverse the if-then statement to: ""If A isn't necessarily possibly false then A isn't possibly false"".  Now by axiom 2 (and by definition) ""A isn't possibly false"" becomes ""A is necessarily true"" (if A can't be false, it must be true). The first half can also be changed via axiom 2 to get: ""If A isn't necessarily not necessarily true then A is necessarily true"", which we can simplify to ""If not necessarily not necessarily A then necessarily A""  The first half of this is the same as ""B isn't necessarily false"" where B is the statement that A is necessarily true. This is equivalent by axiom 2 to ""B is possibly true"". Thus our compounded statement simplifies to:  ""If possibly B then necessarily A"" or by replacing B with ""necessarily A""  ""If possibly necessarily A, then necessarily A""  ",↔

t5_2qh33,Tylerdurdon,1341534862,"Here are some pointers, padwan.  1.) There's no 1 technique for all women, but generally they fall into 2 categories...vaginal vs clitoral orgasms.  If you don't know the difference here, then do some research.  2.) Some women's clits are very sensitive, and you've got to be careful.  The number one thing to being successful is paying attention to her reactions.  This isn't the same as beating off.  It's not going to be a ""harder and faster is always better"" type of deal.  3.) My technique is to pull the top part of her clitoris gently into my mouth (you may have to spread her majoras a little to get there, I usually lick all around for the added arousal fun), and when you've got it sucked in, you rub it with the tip of your tongue in a flicking kind of motion (kind of like you've got some juicy fruit stuck on your teeth), using enough force for her to feel it, but you aren't trying to dig a tunnel to China either.  Keep the rhythm constant (I do about 2 times a second), and *be patient*.    4.) Pay attention to how she's reacting to this, and in the meantime, use your hands to let her know you appreciate the rest of her body too.  Caress those legs, give those breasts a nice feel.  If she seems uncomfortable, you might slow down or move your tongue downwards below her clit (sometimes that's just too much stimulation).  If she isn't reacting too much, you can also use your fingers in her vagina, but we aren't trying to stuff a suitcase here either.  Some women need this part to cum, some don't.  5.) With vaginal stimulation, you will want to put your fingers in (probably 2, but don't just shove both in there, one at a time if need be), palm facing upwards.  You're wanting to stick them in pretty far, but do it gradually (going in and out until you are able to stick them all the way in) and massage an area kind of behind where your mouth is, but inside of her. (I'm not sure how to explain this very well, so go look at some pictures, look for ""g spot"").  6.) Again, be patient (yes, your mouth may get tired, suck it up soldier!)...let her build her enjoyment to it's fruition, and you'll know when you've pulled it off.

t5_2qh2p,Dudesan,1341545193,"Well, you could start with the part where Jesus affirms the entire Old Testament, then the part where he introduces the concept of Eternal Punishment.  Remember, many Christians find it more comfortable to believe in a god who doesn't condone, command or commit murder, slavery, rape, child abuse, animal abuse, arson, torture, ritual mutilation, fratricide, patricide, matricide, infanticide, genocide, and so on than to believe in one who does. Unfortunately, since the Bible (Old Testamant and New) is pretty clear about Yahweh's position on these things, holding a belief in Loving Hippie Jesus™ requires ignoring huge portions of it. Or just never reading it in the first place, which seems to be the most popular option.  Well, let's say what Jesus has to say about that:  &gt;“Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished.  (Matthew 5:17-18, NIV)  Some Christians claim that his death and resurrection ""fulfill"" this. That is bullshit for one simple reason: last time I checked, Heaven and Earth haven't passed away.  Jesus also made his views on people ""picking and choosing"" quite clear:  &gt;[Jesus] answered them, “And why do you break God’s commandment because of your tradition? For God said:    *Honor your father and your mother;* and, *The one who speaks evil of father or mother must be put to death.*  &gt; But you say, ‘Whoever tells his father or mother, “Whatever benefit you might have received from me is a gift committed to the temple”—  he does not have to honor his father.’ In this way, you have revoked God’s word because of your tradition. Hypocrites! Isaiah prophesied correctly about you when he said:    &gt;These people honor Me with their lips, but their heart is far from Me.  They worship Me in vain, teaching as doctrines the commands of men.”  (Matthew 15:3-9, NIV)   Looks like Jesus has quite a bit to say about people who ignore commandments, in fact. But maybe it's just Matthew?  &gt;It is easier for heaven and earth to disappear than for the least stroke of a pen to drop out of the Law.  (Luke 16:17, NIV)  Okay, so Jesus is a bust. Let's see what the Epistles have to say about the Mosaic Code:  &gt; If you really keep the royal law found in Scripture, “Love your neighbor as yourself,” you are doing right.  But if you show favoritism, you sin and are convicted by the law as lawbreakers. For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it.   (James 2:8-10, NIV)  &gt;All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness,  (2 Timothy 3:16)  &gt;Do we, then, nullify the law by this faith? Not at all! Rather, we uphold the law.  (Romans 3:31)  &gt;Know this first of all, that *there is no prophecy of scripture that is a matter of personal interpretation*, for no prophecy ever came through human will; but rather human beings moved by the holy Spirit spoke under the influence of God.""  (2 Peter 1:20-21 NAB)  Well, shit.   This problem disappears quite quickly if you assert that most of the Bible is hogwash, and you only care about the good parts. If you prefer to cling to it as an inspired document, vague mutterings about ""context"" or about Jesus abolishing the old Law won't get you anywhere. ",™

I was really hesitant to tell a lawyer the astronomical amount, but I couldn't lie so I said, ""$95,093.35."" Next, for what seemed like a full minute, all I heard was a man laughing very very hard. ""I'm sorry,"" he said after he completed his laugh. ""I've just never heard of anything like this.""   Manuel went on to inform me of things that further amazed and intrigued me:    * According to Commercial Paper Law the money was now legally mine, because all checks are first assumed to be valid -- and the way a bank invalidates a check is by serving the depositor with a timely notice of dishonor. Considering that it took my bank 33 days to tell me my check had been returned, he did not think they had dishonored the check in time.   * Fraudulent checks ARE a different manner. But he said, ""Since you deposited the check 'thinking there was no chance it would cash, and without even endorsing it' -- you didn't commit fraud.""   * Getting the cashier's check was also not an act of fraud, since the bank had previously assured me the check could no longer be returned.   * There are two practices of law as seen through the eyes of a court: (1) Black Letter of Law, where the court rules strictly by the law (and I would be awarded the money) and (2) Chancery Courts, also known as Courts of Compassion, where the court disregards the law when it is deemed non-sensical. He said that, ""Easily a court could disregard the law and give the money back to the bank because really you have no claim to this money from an equitable sense of the law."" And then he added, ""And when it's an individual vs. a Bank, I'm sorry to say that courts usually side with the bank.""     We agreed to speak again the next day.   When I called him I continued to protecting my anonymity by giving my first name only. It all felt so spy-like. I spoke very little and listened carefully. It had been 24 hours since we first spoke and he had these comments to add:    * I definitely didn't commit fraud because I didn't consummate an act of fraud. I had not cashed the check. But it could be perceived that I attempted to fraud the bank. Proving I had not would require a legal deposition that detailed what I was thinking when I made the deposit and what expectations I had about what I'd do if the money showed up in my account.   * The burning question now (for legal purposes) was, 'WHERE did the money come from?' He presumed the bank in Ohio (The get-rich-quick company's home state), was the bank that was minus $95,093.35. And he stated that they would have to eat the loss if they hadn't sent the check back to my bank on time.    We ended the conversation with no plans to speak again.   The next part of my vacation was at my brother's house in Boston. It was a two week family get-together -- my mom and God son were also there. We spent very little time talking about the money, but when we did everyone thought it was an amusing incident, everyone except my Mom. It stressed her out a lot. She worried that the bank would get meaner and meaner, and that they might try to throw me in jail. One day I jokingly told her I was going to buy her a Lexus with presents in the back. She smiled for an instant and then she pinched my arm and said, ""You better not!""   My Mother helped me a considerable amount. One day I went into my brother's home office. I was upset because I had requested a photocopy of the check from my bank and instead they had sent me a photocopy of someone else's $6.71 check. I wanted to see what the sample check I had deposited looked like. It seemed like my only option was to call the Security Officer with my request. But then my Mom came in and pulled up a chair next to me. After hearing what I wanted, she said, ""Patrick you don't have to speak to a Security Officer about this. Call the President of the Bank. Haven't I taught you to deal with VIP's?! They're the ones with true power."" And then, as I tried to reach the President of First Interstate Bank by phone, my Mom just sat there giving me strength.   It took many phone calls (more than it should!) to find out the name and number of the President, and when I did call for Bill Siart, I was told that the Consumer Affairs Department was as close as you can get. I reached the manager of the department and said, ""I have a problem with my branch office and I'm looking for help. I want to resolve this amicably, without a lawyer, but I'm having a lot of trouble speaking with anyone who wants to help me handle this fairly."" Instantly the manager became helpful. I requested a photocopy of the front and the back of the check and an official letter from the bank. When I told her that Robert Gage in Security had denied me a letter, she recognized Gage as someone high up in Security, and she assured me she would call him and see if it was possible for me to get such a letter. She lived up to her promise because by the next day Robert Gage was faxing the things I requested to me in Boston.   What arrived by fax was a surprise. It was incredible to see the and back of the check. I had not remembered just how real it looked -- and it was actually the first time that I could confirm that it in fact matched all nine criteria for a negotiable instrument. Up until then I had just been working from memory.   But what really surprised me was the 'official letter' from my bank stating the check's return. What came out of the fax machine wasn't any sort of letter from my bank -- it was a memo from First Chicago Bank -- and it was a piece of the puzzle of how this whole thing could have happened.  The memo (which had the amount of my check on one line and the word 'non-negotiable' circled on another) had a name and phone number for an Account Adjuster on it. I decided to call. My brother always says, ""More information is always good.""   I reached the man on who had written the memo. I explained to him who I was and why I was calling. He explained that the memo I now possessed was the notice of dishonor that he sent to my bank about the $95,093.35 check. On the same day that he sent the memo, his bank also reclaimed $95,093.35 from my bank. So MY bank was out the money! ""Yes,"" he confirmed. ""All the other bank's involved have recovered their money.""   Suddenly it dawned on me, this memo was dated June 5th. That's the day my bank learned that the check had been dishonored. Why they waited until June 21st to notify me was a mystery, especially considering that legally they were supposed to notify me by Midnight of June 6th! No doubt about it now, my bank had made a big mistake -- AND they faxed me a memo to prove it!   At the end of the conversation this man did me another big favor, he obliged my request for the names of the other banks involved. He didn't even mind telling me who I should ask for directly and what item number I should reference.   From calling the other banks involved I learned the movement of the check and the details of the fiasco. I deposited the check on Friday, May 19th. On Monday, May 21st it was overlooked by my bank and sent onto the bank in Chicago that was acting as a clearinghouse. It was again overlooked there. The next day, on May 22rd, it was sent onto the Federal Reserve Bank in Cleveland OH and this bank rejected the check, calling it a 'non-cash' item (Whether or not it SHOULD have been rejected as a 'non-cash' item is questionable in my mind considering what I learned about the meaninglessness of the words 'non negotiable' on a check, but that's what the FED said). Take note that the FED Bank rejected the check within 48 hours of when it left my bank. The check was then routed to the get-rich-quick company's bank in Cleveland. The Cleveland bank says they sent a notice of dishonor immediately to the bank in Chicago. I cannot confirm when the Cleveland bank actually sent their notice of dishonor, but I do know that the bank in Chicago sent my bank notice of dishonor on June 5th.   I've read that bank computers are programmed to bring special attention to checks above $500. Can anyone tell me why any bank would delay attending to a dishonored $95,093.35 check with the words 'non-negotiable' on the face, when they know they have a Midnight Deadline?? If you're Commander of the NASA control room, and you notice a disastrous leak five minutes before the shuttle launches, that is something you attend to immediately. (I know, bad analogy).   Back to the story. After learning the path of the check, I made an entry into my journal:   The bank knows they made a big mistake. But instead of calling me and explaining their mistake, they called and bullied me with scare tactics, ""banking"" on my being ignorant and fearful. Apparently they feel they're powerful enough to avoid admitting to their mistakes and powerful enough to deny me even the right to fair treatment -- refusing to even send me a letter about this. I don't think they're that powerful.""",©

The creature had become aware of the villages recent attempts to increase security and left a warning written in blood on the village hall for everyone to see, it translated roughly to ""Don’t oppose me, I’ll kill you bitches”.   There had been a meeting between the nearby towns law enforcement agencies and a crack team of mercenaries was being assembled, “Bring me the head of the creature who has terrorised this place for so long,” spoke the man at the podium, “and you will be rewarded beyond your wildest dreams”, he continued, “honestly, you’ll get cars and houses and… woman and… cakes… whatever you want.”   The mercenaries set out into the jungle at dawn the next morning, in search of the heinous monster… A group of 40 armed men… Their numbers would decrease rapidly; their blood would be spilled…   (To be continued).   The mercenaries had been feeling a cold chill and the rustling of trees branches as they moved through the thick jungle. Each one tried to convince himself it was ‘just the wind’ but each one had their doubts… They stopped to rest and have a headcount after 4 hours of struggling through the dense overgrown wilderness; despite being extremely experienced, their tracker was having difficulty following the trail of the daunting creature. Its tracks resembled that of the letter “u”, he had never seen anything like it… “Johnson” shouted the soldier clutching the clipboard in charge of the headcount. “We’re two short.” “You’re 5”8 private, don’t be too hard on yourself,” replied the general. “No, I mean we’re missing two men.” “Oh, why are you missing them?” “Missing from our group…” “Oh I understand fully now. That was a funny mix-up though, that would’ve gotten a lot of laughs if it wasn’t for the gloomy nature of the situation.” “Yes, it would’ve been hilarious,” continued the soldier as he handed him the clipboard. “We should write it down and send it to someone.” “Don’t be ridiculous, only an idiot would read this nonsense…”   They continued on, despite not discussing the strange disappearance of the two men, which they both conveniently forgot about after their hilarious misunderstanding. Hours later the entered a clearing and the tracker abruptly stopped. Everyone held their breath intently, he sneezed and carried on. “I thought something intense was going to happen there,” said one man, “I’m pretty glad it didn’t though. I mean, if I was watching someone else do this or reading about it then yeah it’d would’ve been interesting if something had happened, but as it’s actually happening to me in real life I’m quite eager to stay safe, I really don’t want to get inju-“ The man’s sentence was cut short. “AAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH, I’LL KILL YOU BITCHES!” As a machete flew from between the trees and cut the man’s face off, like John Travolta in “Face Off.” It fell to the floor like a thin cut pepperoni pizza. “Want fries with that?” Shouted the creature as it pulled of its aviator sunglasses in a cool 80’s police drama fashion and pulled out an AK47 and started shooting towards the group. They scattered, still dazed from how quickly it had all happened. “Draw your weapons!” shouted the general. Seven men went down before they could get pencils out. The rest quickly got to work sketching pictures of machetes and AK47s. “Shoot the thing! We’ll do artwork later.” Screamed the general, but before even a shot was fired, the creature was gone…   There were only 14 men left now, they got seriously annihilated. “What was that creature?” one of the remaining few asked the group. “It looked like a horse.” “Don’t be ridiculous…” one man replied incredulously…   (To be continued)   There was a profound silence throughout the night as the mercenaries slept, broken only by what appeared to be the sound of coconuts being hit together, and occasional sobs from the distraught men. “Letting them watch `Marley and me’ before bedtime was a bad idea.”  The general said to the guard who was keeping watch. “What a bunch of wimps.” The guard replied through stifled crying. “General,” he continued, wiping away the rain that had landed on his tear ducts, “what are the chances we’re going to make it home alive? I’d sure like to see my wife again.” “I really don’t- wait, really? Your wife is gross man, I thought the only reason you came on this trip was to get away from her.” the general replied in disbelief. “When I first met you both I thought you were the woman.” “Hey, you watch your mouth, she’s been post op for over 4 years now.” The guard snapped. “Okay, settle down, anyway, to answer your original question, when you say `will we make it home’ it’s quite uncertain. Personally, I’ll make it home fine as I keep this lucky horseshoe with me at all times.”   The creature had been watching the mercenaries for days now, stalking them, not making his presence known yet keeping in close proximity to the group; letting their fear develop, he was waiting for his opportune moment to strike… Building the tension, one might say…   The general had called for re-enforcements after the attack a few days ago which greatly reduced their numbers. The re-enforcements turned up the next day. A jeep load of men from the village, they couldn’t have been more than twenty years old. As they pulled the jeep into the camp, the mercenaries pointed and laughed at their parking skills…   “We’ve lost a lot of good men on this mission!” The general addressed the group, “such as Steve, Graham, and some others, I can’t really remember anyone else. Isn’t it strange how we all have such western names despite being Cambodian, and how we all speak perfect English?” The men nodded in agreement. “Let’s honour those men by finding this creature and avenging their deaths!” The general shouted.   They carried on deeper into the jungle, arbitrarily following the general who insisted he knew how to track the creature, little did he know, he was the one being tracked…  An air of morbid resignation hung over the Cambodian jungle, and the heads of those who occupied it, the time of their reckoning had come.   The group had been silent for a number of hours now, they had come across a dismembered body a few miles previously, and they now seemed to be wading through the carrion… Lifeless eyes stared up at them from the overgrown jungle floor and occasionally their motionless cadavers would be strung up in trees with vines, hanging like icicles from desolate window sills… (This is getting quite dark and poetic).   A feeling of unease spread throughout the group like a virus, some of them had heard what seemed to be the sound of drums, some believed it was the sound of bones cracking…   After struggling through many miles of the dense, humid rainforest they arrived at a river, it was as wide as two tennis courts, and there wasn’t a crossing in sight. “It looks like we’ll have to swim across.” said one of the young men from the reinforcement team. “Really?” said the general in a sarcastic tone. “That’s an ingenious idea. I was going to suggest flying, or building a giant catapult and firing ourselves across to the other side.” “No need to be a dick about it.” said the young man, dismayed.   The troop waded through the murky water, exhausting all their energy against the current which yearned to pull them to their deaths. The first man reached the shore, there was a loud crack and the troop froze. A branch had fallen in front of the man. A full minute of silence passed, you could have heard a pin drop, had they not been in a river. Each and every man scoured the surrounding jungle.   The man on shore turned cautiously, “must’ve just been the wind, or some-“ his sentence was cut short and he choked as a machete emerged from his chest. The men gasped, “THE RIVER WILL RUN RED WITH YOUR BLOOD. YOUR FAMILIES WON’T RECOGNISE YOUR BODIES. Basically, I’LL KILL YOU BITCHES!” The creature leapt from nowhere, its lifeless eyes the colour of DietCoke®, blood dripping from its dagger sharp teeth.   Before the mercenaries could even draw their weapons, the creature was in the water; it tore throats out with its teeth, smashed skulls with its kick and issued a cold cackle as it slaughtered the group of helpless soldiers with its bare hands (hooves). Not a shot was fired, nor a knife drawn… Betrayed horse lay on the bank of the river surveying his destruction, the river had turned red with blood and the bodies of the men were being pulled down river by the current.   There was nothing left for him here… He had exhausted his resources. He would move on from this place, continue his journey, after one last visit the village, he wanted dessert…",®

Contents      1 Features     2 Development     3 References     4 External links  Features  The final version of the game will feature seventeen playable characters in all with the six major characters from the show playable from launch.[3] Eleven more characters will follow in semi-regular updates.[4] The game will be downloadable and free to play. Both local and online multiplayer modes will be included as well as a story mode.[7] Character specific moves will also be present in-game.[7] My Little Pony: Fighting Is Magic will feature various stages that represent places from Equestria, the setting of My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic. Development  The game uses the Fighter Maker game engine.[4] The team has released early pre-alpha gameplay footage that displays basic game mechanics such as launches, juggles and hyper combos as seen in existing fighting game franchises such as Marvel vs. Capcom and Guilty Gear. So far, they have only released footage showing how Twilight Sparkle, Rarity, Pinkie Pie, and Applejack play.[8][3] There has been a small amount of footage showing off one of Fluttershy's attacks but little is known about her other moves. The final character, Rainbow Dash, is still under development.  Though an unlicensed work from Hasbro, the holders of the My Little Pony franchise intellectual property, the Mane6 team has not received any cease and desist notices from the company to date.[9] Like much of the rest of the Internet phenomenon surrounding Friendship is Magic, Hasbro has allowed episodes of the show along with parodies and mashups of the works to be redistributed freely across the Internet, helping to create a participatory culture that has drawn a broader audience to the show, even going as far as to say they have no intentions of ever filing takedown notices as they see this as ""Free Advertising and spreading"".[10][11]  On January 30th, Prominence left the Mane6 due to personal reasons.[12] References      ^ a b ""MLP: Fighting is Magic"".

t5_2qore,Globbi,1341590740,"If you spend all your money on melee crit build you can definitely get it going enough to even get through act 3. I wouldn't recommend full tank build, if you don't go with another DPS char you would have problems with enrages. To get enough crit%, overall dps and enough resistance you would have to spend a lot.  Depending on build you may need different numbers of crit% and ap/crit. I use no spectral blades but only tornadoes and explosions (still experimenting with my build though) and need about 15 ap/crit total to have it efficient with total crit% near 40. It's quite a lot but not that hard to get it if you sacrifice some stats and this build doesn't need attack speed.  You don't need boots with movespeed so you can get int/vit/res pretty cheap. Tanky gloves with crit chance but no AS should not be too costly (you will have to drop crit dmg on gloves though, it makes them many times more expensive). On weapon you need socket and ap/crit but it's cheap if you sacrifice damage (I got wand under 600 dps when I first tried this build and did ok in act 3). Life on hit is nice but can be omitted until act 3.  Scoundrel gives you 3% crit ♥.  I find teleport with fracture essential. I can't stand in desacration, arcane beams or get frozen so I have move around a lot. Teleport is much faster than walking and recharges quickly from crit procs. On some mobs I also constantly use tp to just get images - archers with nightmarish that keep distance from you are difficult to be kept in place all at once so distractions help a lot.",♥

They explain it here, and with a DNS there's little more they could do, unless they redirect you to fake sites.   &gt;How does it work? Tunlr does not provide a virtual private network (VPN). Tunlr is a DNS (domain name system) unblocking service. We’re using sophisticated technologies (a.k.a. the Tunlr Secret Sauce ©) to re-adress certain data envelopes, tricking the receiver into thinking the envelope originated from within the U.S. For these data envelopes, Tunlr is transparently creating a network tunnel from your location to our U.S.-based servers. Any data that’s not directly related to the video or music content providers which Tunlr supports is not only left untouched, it’s also not even routed through Tunlr. In order to use Tunlr, you will have to change the DNS address.  All in all it works, it as safe as it could probably be without costing them thousands of dollars.   My opinion is use at your own risk, but it is transparent enough that it would be hard to hide if it was malicious. ",©

Personally I would crop the right-most column of windows, and also the bottom row. If you then used Adobe Magic™ to straighten what was left, I'd be sold. Like, I'd wallpaper whole rooms with it. That would be cool, huh?  I dig the repetition, the contrast, all the little details and variations on the theme that you can discover the more you pour over the photo.

t5_2qh4r,master_baiter,1341644998,"Desiderata  Go placidly amid the noise and haste, and remember what peace there may be in silence.  As far as possible without surrender be on good terms with all persons.  Speak your truth quietly and clearly; and listen to others, even the dull and ignorant; they too have their story.  Avoid loud and aggressive persons, they are vexations to the spirit. If you compare yourself with others, you may become vain and bitter; for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.  Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans.  Keep interested in your career, however humble; it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time.  Exercise caution in your business affairs; for the world is full of trickery.  But let this not blind you to what virtue there is; many persons strive for high ideals; and everywhere life is full of heroism.  Be yourself.  Especially, do not feign affection.  Neither be critical about love; for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment it is as perennial as the grass.  Take kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering the things of youth.  Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune. But do not distress yourself with imaginings.  Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness. Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself.  You are a child of the universe, no less than the trees and the stars; you have a right to be here.  And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should.  Therefore be at peace with God, whatever you conceive Him to be, and whatever your labors and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life keep peace with your soul.  With all its sham, drudgery and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful world. Be careful. Strive to be happy.   © Max Ehrmann 1927 ",©

t5_2rzgi,BobisOnlyBob,1341649198,"&gt;I don't even know which ones are antagonists or protagonists or what the plot is or anything.  Plot varies from game to game; [Defeat Means Friendship](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatMeansFriendship ""☢CAUTION!!☢ TVTropes Link""), so the antagonist of one game tends to become the ally of the next, or at least goes back to their respective supernatural domain and stays out the way. When feasts and parties happen, everyone tends to be invited, even if they've previously blacked out the skies, stolen the essence of spring, built a second sun underground to conquer the surface with, accidentally a giant robot golem, or worse. However, the main three protagonist girls barely change - [Reimu](http://touhou.wikia.com/wiki/Reimu_Hakurei), the shrine maiden in red and white; [Marisa](http://touhou.wikia.com/wiki/Marisa_Kirisame), the perfectly ordinary witch; and [Sakuya](http://touhou.wikia.com/wiki/Sakuya_Izayoi), the Maid of Time. I wish I was kidding about that last one.  Plots tend to be along the lines of ""a major incident has occurred and it's starting to piss off the humans, fairies, and *youkai* (supernatural beings) of the magical and sealed realm of [Gensokyo](http://touhou.wikia.com/wiki/Gensokyo). Reimu/Marisa/Sakuya set out to find out who is responsible for the skies being dark/winter never ending/ghosts swarming out of the earth. They magically shoot their way through a bunch of different fairies, youkai and deities until they find the one responsible, have an epic and fireworks-like battle of magical energy, and eventually the being responsible relents and restores things back to how they should be. Then everyone crashes Reimu's shrine to have tea and cake and generally piss Reimu off."" The doujins tend to deal with more everyday life and interactions between the casts of different games, their similarities, differences and conflicts.  Like I said, antagonists tend to become protagonists, so in the games where the girls have a support 'partner', they tend to be able to choose from a roster of characters from prior games, like former superboss [Yukari Yakumo](http://touhou.wikia.com/wiki/Yukari_Yakumo) can be paired off with Reimu to give her a teleport ability.  Personally I suck at the games, so I've picked this up through a mix of watching the game played on YouTube, the anime episode and shorts, and the various doujin manga (which vary wildly in their interpretations of the characters).  Oh, and did you know a Homestuck track references Touhou music? ""[Heir Conditioning](http://homestuck.bandcamp.com/track/heir-conditioning)"" is a mixture of ""[Beloved Tomboyish Daughter](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wN1BhwqX29w)"" (Cirno's theme) and ""[Solar Sect of Mystic Wisdom ~ Nuclear Fusion](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1_t1PwuegA)"" (Utsuho's theme). I think others might show up as minor mix elements, but I'm not sure.",☢

t5_2qq65,reddbdb,1341670507,"Hello Scotchit, here is my 2nd review.  The Highland Park 12.  Everyone, you did not steer me wrong.  This is a fantastic scotch.  I had this in a bar that had a nice selection of scotches to try while waiting for dinner at another restaurant.  Lucky for me we had to wait 1.5 hours!  I had the Talisker and Caol Illa after ☺.  I had a good bar seat with friendly people around having a good time   * Price near me Bottle $41.99 US , Dram $8 * Color: It was a little dark in the bar, but amber. * Nose: Molasses with a touch of peat.  There was something else I couldn’t put my finger on.  * Taste: Smooth, excites my palate, when I held it on my tongue it would thicken nicely (nothing I have experienced with cheaper scotches), Molasses and honey, then there is the touch of peat.  Almost wished the flavors were even stronger. Excellent. * Finish: The finish lasts long and makes you pay attention (me as a novice).  Smooth with a touch of peat again.  There was a sweetness again for me, but this time it switched cinnamon.  Beginners out there, Listen to Scotchit.  Highland Park is a fantastic scotch to begin your love affair.  The taste difference between this and some bottles that cost ½ as much is substantial.  Unfortunately, as a father of 2, this can’t be my go to bottle for every weekend.  But, for special occasions, this has a spot in my life.  * Taste: 70/75 * Value: 11/15 * Uniqueness 4/5 * Would I Buy Again 5/5 * Score= 90/100 ",☺

This is exceedingly tangential, but Mr. Rogers agrees that controlling your emotions makes you the master of your life:   What do you do with the mad that you feel When you feel so mad you could bite? When the whole wide world seems oh, so wrong... And nothing you do seems very right?  What do you do? Do you punch a bag? Do you pound some clay or some dough? Do you round up friends for a game of tag? Or see how fast you go?  It's great to be able to stop When you've planned a thing that's wrong, And be able to do something else instead And think this song:  I can stop when I want to Can stop when I wish. I can stop, stop, stop any time. And what a good feeling to feel like this And know that the feeling is really mine. Know that there's something deep inside That helps us become what we can. For a girl can be someday a woman And a boy can be someday a man.  What Do You Do with the Mad that You Feel? By Fred M. Rogers © 1968",©

Even without these benefits, unregulated economies inevitably reach oligopoly/monopoly status: it's simply the nature of capital: it accumulates. That's why the '20s was the Age of Trusts, which weren't exactly splendid for consumers, investors or business, ten years out.

Or that Libertarianism is a great Ivory Tower theory that will always crash (and crash hard) on the shoals of reality when implemented in the real world (hmm: much like Communism or Fascism, both too are great in theory, lousy in practice). That any version of Libertarianism will result in a Kleptocracy by multinationals: there's no other outcome.  Leaving those aside: both scenarios presented will lead to ""artificial"" aspects of the economy. Yours suggests Exxon, BP, Goldman Sachs or Tepco will be a careful steward of public interests while maximizing profits. Versus Whatevrmn suggesting that's not entirely realistic, and that however flawed democracies are, they give some control to its citizens.

It's easy to start thinking of soft-edged scenarios in which my fiancé and I have the perfect little family, but I've seen enough of real life to know that's not how that goes down. Mother nature is a horrible cunt with an arsenal of tricks. Just because my ovaries and uterus are on their monthly hormone surge or sometimes I get a little emotional about missing out on the Experience™ (which is always a biproduct of the hormone surge) it doesn't mean I actually *want that.* My mouth would also love to taste pasta and French fries every day too but I know better.  This is part of the reason why I'm disgusted when people blythely make statements about ""all women craving a baby inside them."" it's insulting because no woman has control over what her biology does, but every woman does have a brain. That statement reduces women as a whole down to nothing but irrational hormonally driven creatures who exist for making babies.

Also, it won't make your mind race as it's purpose is to stop that from happening :') In fact, I take a small dose of my medication like 30 mins before bed and it helps me go to sleep ♥  Also, just wondering...are you seeing a therapist? Whenever you take psychiatric medication you should try to mix it with therapy. Having someone to cry to and who knows how to get through to your anxious/depressed brain is so nice.  All in all, don't be worried! ADHD meds are wonderful and if you're not already in some kind of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), I recommend it! ",♥

Having resistances to certain elements matter would require people to think and care about something else than EHP just like different effects on elemental damages would require to care about something else than DPS.  More seriously, I agree, single resistances should be higher. There could be affixes for double resists (fire + physical ♥ instead of resist all) giving a bit higher than those giving all. I would like having more interesting options. On the other hand it would make gear rolls even more random, with cold resistance pretty useless (and it's also a bad design that one resist is useless).

t5_2ss5b,SilentProtagonist,1341781176,"Not to go on a rant here, the problem isn't so much people arguing for guns (well, that too but it's a different problem) but the fact that *particularly* on Reddit there's a false dichotomy about anti-gun being pro-crime, this romanticized assumption that good ol' violence is the solver of all problems, going so far - as anticlimactic-story has shown - that not owning a gun is an invitation to criminals, resulting in a world view that actually assumes an armed society is a polite society.   There probably are some limited pro-gun positions I could accept (for sporting purposes and whatnot) but the rhetoric in subreddits like /r/guns that ridicules terms like ""assault weapon"" as literally meaningless scare-words made up by hippie girly men who want to take everyone's gun away for some survivalist-ish reason makes it clear that I in particular won't be having a gun-debate on Reddit as there seem to be only two positions: AK47s for everyone vs. let the baddies have free reign.   Oh and by the way: the very common pro-gun arguments about shooters and crime often reduce crime to the Dark Alley™, that beloved pro-gun backdrop which turns every criminal situation into an old west showdown in which it would be almost negligent not to have a gun. I don't think I've ever heard someone say something to the effect of ""in certain situations guns could be better than different means of self-defense, in others not so much"" as it is always ""gun &gt; everything, always""  And that's the thing - from where I'm standing, all I can see are gun *nuts*. Don't tell me I'm biased when I use their biased world-view as a background for my argument.

What does he like about your sex life? What parts aren't working so well? Are there things you want to experiment with? Ask lots of questions, and try to listen in a thoughtful manner.

t5_2r9tk,Hiskitten,1341805512,"No question is insensitive or ignorant - if you don't ask it, how would you know how others deal with these issues? ☺  i'm not 24/7, He's out of town, but there are ALWAYS issues that we deal with in a committed relationship. So i can only speak from the point of view of an LDR. There are times i need to talk to Him about things that are bothering me...and while i keep my respect for Him at all times - i can't see Him in any way less than respected by me - i am free to express myself to Him.   The key is mutual respect. If you're in a 24/7 relationship in ANY dynamic, if you don't respect one another and can't communicate honestly, there's something wrong. That's relationship 101, not even lifestyle-related. But in the lifestyle where there is a power exchange, i would hope it's known that any issues can be discussed as long as there is that respect. If the submissive cannot - or is not allowed to - express those views as an equal for the time of conversation, at least there can be honest communication with expressions of one's status. For example, if i have something i want to discuss with my Master, i'll ask for permission to speak freely. It is ALWAYS granted. He is the kind of person who ALWAYS asks my thoughts, no matter what we're discussing. But in matters where it is not related, directly, to the lifestyle, He actually expects me to express them. Honestly, openly, with the same respect any couple shows one another.  i am interested to hear the responses of those in a 24/7 TPE...for the future, ya know. ;-)  Hope this isn't too muddled and you can get something from my reply...i'll be happy to clarify if not.",☺

If you literally say that to her, I can't imagine you have a relationship where you see each other as valued equals.  My response is an adaptation to the way she asks. At some point in the past, I allowed her to believe that it was OK for her to be disrespectful to me. I've learned that I have to put a stop to such behavior and *can't* reward it.  When I first started doing this, I had to do it a lot. I very rarely have to push back like this now.  &gt; Defensive Death Spiral  I know this well. I've learned to deal with this by,  * Drinking less. If I'm sober, I can actually stop most conflicts before they even get started. * Keeping my sense of humor. This also helps, because to keep my humor I have to * detach from the situation. If I don't take things personally, I can better handle any insults that come my way and also keep my eye on my goals in the conflict. * Acknowledge when I'm wrong as soon as I can. I call this, 'getting to right.' What do people want to do in these arguments? They want to *win*. I win by being *right*. Therefore, I want to be *right*. Even if I started off in the wrong, if I get it right, I win. She wins too. Win-Win. That's good. * Switch between  logic-speak and feeling-speak when appropriate. This has made a huge difference. In the past, she was all feeling-speak and I was all logic-speak. She still has issues with going to logic, but as the 'Daywalker' I can effectively speak her language and still use mine.  * There can be faulty logic, but there are no faulty feelings. Acknowledge all feeling-speak. I can destroy an argument built on faulty logic, but if she *feels* hurt, then she's hurting. Refuting that will just make her hurt worse. That's a Bad Thing™. ",™

Also hydrate your entire epidermis with some decent body lotion daily, not that generic crap that goes for $5 a jug.

If, after every ride, you are cleaning and lubing your chain, so long as you are using *something* with lubricating properties, you will prolong the life of your chain.   Modern O-ring and X-ring chains contain lubricant within the rollers of the chain. That lube has the consistency of grease. If WD-40, Liquid Wrench, Deep Creep, etc breech the O-rings they will break the lubricant down and leave you with nothing to lubricate the rollers on the pins (the most important place for lube to be).  DuPont™ Teflon™ Multi-Use Lubricant has given me good results on all of my motorcycles. I use it on all five that I own currently and have two bikes with over 20,000 miles on their chains (the others are new). It is self-cleaning and doesn't make a mess by attracting dirt.

They believe in a single God Jehovah who created all things by means of his first creation Jesus. No belief in a afterlife that includes heaven, literal death and later resurrection after Armageddon to perfect physical and spiritual condition.   Armageddon is going to be God's war where he takes back control of the earth after letting Satan try to demonstrate his ability to rule. The start of this conflict involves the United Nations turning against all religions worldwide along with a global financial collapse. The JW's escape unscathed and are presented with 1000 years of perfect physical and spiritual conditions during which righteous humans are resurrected from the dead, do not age, get sick, and rebuild the earth. After the 1000's years Satan will again be allowed to tempt humans and those that follow him will be destroyed.  &gt; **What are the practices and meeting places (kingdom hall) like?**  Kingdom Halls™ are not really that fancy and value utility over aesthetics. They usually look like a nice office building inside and are built as cheaply as possible. Normally they have a conference room (the doom-room), a small library, a counter (Literature Desk™) where current literature is stored and dispensed, and a main auditorium.  The Sunday meeting is for the public. It normally consists of a public sermon and then a Q&amp;A where the Study Edition™ of the Watchtower™ magazine is considered paragraph by paragraph. The magazine even lists the questions so everyone can give a canned answer and the guy on stage doesn't need to think too hard.  The weekly meeting targets the congregation. Here's a [sample of the schedule](http://i.imgur.com/Fb0bl.png) from the Kingdom Ministry™ (basically a newspaper you only get if you're a regular member). The book study covers the current propaganda book and follows the same format as the Q&amp;A on Sundays. The Theocratic Ministry School™ is a series of short sermons given by the brothers in the congregation (except the No. 3, that's a short play given by the sisters). The Service Meeting™ is a series of sermons given by the Elders™ or Ministerial Servants™ in the Congregation. These normally cover the listed material, in this case (fake/exaggerated) examples from the Yearbook™ and a short article in the earlier referenced Kingdom Ministry™. Again, see the earlier Q&amp;A format.   &gt; **Weird ass rituals?**  The memorial (subject in itself really) which is basically a communion ritual on Nissan 14 in which only the 144000 actually partake. The congregation just passes the bread and wine around without actually taking any.  I'm sure there will be other comments to fill in more of these...  &gt; **Issues that helped you break away from being a JW; doctrinal, social, political?**  I'm just going to hit the high points...  * Stance on evolution. Creationist, anti-evolution, anti-science rhetoric. [This article](http://www.tj-encyclopedie.org/Blatant_misquotes_in_the_Origin_of_Life_booklet) is a good representation of many issues they have. * Stance on blood. Jehovah's Witnesses refuse blood based on Acts 15:29. This stance has become more liberal over time. They were formally anti-vaccine and considered organ transplants cannibalistic. * Control. Everything is based on social control. They hit nearly every bullet point on the [BITE model](http://freedomofmind.com/Info/BITE/bitemodel.php)  &gt; **The extent of the cult brainwashing that occurred**  See ritualistic shunning, death of friends due to refusal of medical care, etc. It's very hard to measure the amount of damage that has been done.",™

t5_2qh1i,kenerdedy,1341870410,"""Which is correct as the plural of LEGO: 'Lego' or 'Legos'? Neither, actually. The word 'LEGO', when used as a noun, should only refer to the company that makes the product. Otherwise 'LEGO' is supposed to be used as an adjective.

You obviously didn't understand it the first time.   &gt;Effects on Driving: The drug manufacturer suggests that patients receiving treatment with Marinol® should be specifically warned not to drive until it is established that they are able to tolerate the drug and perform such tasks safely. Epidemiology data from road traffic arrests and fatalities indicate that after alcohol, marijuana is the most frequently detected psychoactive substance among driving populations. Marijuana has been shown to impair performance on driving simulator tasks and on open and closed driving courses for up to approximately 3 hours. Decreased car handling performance, increased reaction times, impaired time and distance estimation, inability to maintain headway, lateral travel, subjective sleepiness, motor incoordination, and impaired sustained vigilance have all been reported. Some drivers may actually be able to improve performance for brief periods by overcompensating for self-perceived impairment. The greater the demands placed on the driver, however, the more critical the likely impairment. Marijuana may particularly impair monotonous and prolonged driving. Decision times to evaluate situations and determine appropriate responses increase. Mixing alcohol and marijuana may dramatically produce effects greater than either drug on its own.",®

As there is no incentive for a renter to overstretch themselves financially rent will not increase beyond what the market can bear. If the rents go too high people will just stop renting and go somewhere else.   Meanwhile, the general attitude in Canada is that a house is a good investment, so even if you need to live off of gruel it's all worth it because you're building Equity™! That works, until the market sours or you are in a bind and need to sell and can't (or at least not at the price you want).

t5_2s5sk,SgtPsycho,1341903053,"(Sorry for slow reply, I was thinking about your post.)  *Shrugs*   I'm not trigger-prone so I can't speak to it's existence.  I have spent a lot of time talking to people who do feel that way though, and they will argue very passionately about it.  I was just trying to warn you that if you felt I was outspoken, others will take to you task on your comments very strongly.  My partner was abused as a child, so I make every effort not to trigger an episode for her.  In that regard, I think that showing a little consideration for other people's uncontrollable feelings is not uncalled for.  I'm not talking about making people feel bad (as you describe, yes we all have that), I'm talking about inducing psychotic episodes, catatonia, or maybe even initiating self-harm.  These are people on the edge.  I don't have any actual examples of trigger warnings triggering episodes, but that's what been described to me to describe just how unstable and sensitive some people are.  So people from this group tell me that trigger warnings are actually *really* valuable for them.  Coming back to the topic, it's just like the rating warning.  You know that certain content warned about will be experienced, so it is up to you to judge whether you can handle that.  I suspect, as mentioned above it's a question of exposure.  I think it's arguable that far less emotional damage would be done by the warning of a particular scene than actually seeing the scene itself.  The dry text is far less emotionally provocative than the video.  I get what you're saying about 'the club' and non-Transgender allies regularly fall into the privilege/trigger trap where you're not allowed to mention particular words or phrases ""because they're triggers"" and then when they ask ""why?"" or ""where does this come from?"" they get accused of being hypocrites, pursuing a cisgender agenda, to ""check their privilege"" and of deliberate trolling to hurt people.  Suffice to say that nothing is explained, and you're expected to 'know' things, which can never, ever, be discussed.  They then get verbally gang-bashed.  Frustrating.  On to...  &gt;I know, 50% odds. Clearly a sexist conspiracy.  Well, 1/17 really (the number of crew on the ship), or 3(?)/17 based on sex.  I guess it just got to me that they picked on this one character and really seemed to have it in for her.  By comparison, while the fates of the other crew who were infected/attacked were terrible, they didn't seem as horrible.  As reddited here before, what happened to the Millburn?  Why wasn't this followed up?  Agreed, there's plot holes you could drive the Sualco through, Shaw's Amazing Recovery™ is just one of the more egregious of them.

He's feeling Anderson out &amp; trying to keep him guessing.  Look at his hands though.  His right is cocked back.  That's Hendos TM.  He threatens w/ the takedown &amp; turns it into the overhand right (or vice-versa, hence the feints you mentioned).  His oppoents drop to get underhooks &amp; expose their chin in the process (or don't &amp; risk getting taken down).  That's what Hendo was trying to accomplish.  Hendo relies more on takedowns against the cage or from the clinch than he does the power double.  Technically he's incoporating wrestling, but he's not ""wrestling him"" in the way Chael has.  He's using wrestling as a setup for striking &amp; he takes the TD if a body lock presents itself.  He's always done this.  If you watch the beginning of round 2 you can see his intention is to try to KO anderson.  If he was ""wrestling"" anderson he would have powered him against the cage, then dropped down to a double leg.  Instead he exchanges &amp; pretends to go for the single when he catches a kick, but really throws the overhand right followed by some ""Dirty Boxing ™"" in close.  Even when he had him against the cage, he was using it for ""Dirty Boxing ™"", to wear AS out &amp; land on the exit.  Now he did attempt one trip during the body lock, but overall he was striking.  The only time Hendo was wrestling was off a trip in the first.  The rest of the time he was striking.  I gave facts, it's not an opinon about how he's lost in the past &amp; it's not an opinion that many of the fighters he fought had 1 or 2 ""winning streak(s)"" &amp; went on to be cut.  Those are facts.  It's not an opinion that he's mostly gone against strikers or BJJ guys w/ mediocre striking &amp; wrestling.  Hendo &amp; Chael are different.  Just like Hendo &amp; Couture are different.  Just because they're wrestlers who trained at Team Quest together doesn't make them clones.  Hendo doesn't have the power double that Chael does.  In his wrestling career he relied on freakish strength to overwhelm whereas Chael relied more on transition speed.  If you watch their NCAA matches (&amp; their MMA matches obv) it's clear.  They're both good but they employ different methods.  Chael's wrestling translates better to MMA than Hendos.  Chael powers through &amp; Hendo sets it up or threatens with it to land standing up.  Hendo's wrestling philsophy in his own words http://www.flowrestling.org/speaker/2301-Dan-Henderson/video/502290-MMA-Unlocked-WRESTLING-With-Dan-Henderson First sentence is telling ""It's hard to knock someone out from your back..""  If you're getting pissed off because you're imaginging how silvas opponents feel &amp; you believe that even mentioning why they were stylistically mismatched or why they didn't deserve a fight because of their record/previous opponents, that's something you control.  It doesn't change the facts though.  If they put some 15 year old from a ymca karate class in there against silva and somebody said *""WTH is the UFC thinking?""* would you get upset because that kid wanted a shot at the title &amp; tried his best?  Yes, this example probably has you pulling out your hair; it's meant to be ridiculous on purpose.

t5_2qh2p,Dudesan,1341942358,"&gt;One of the teachers of the law came and heard them debating. Noticing that Jesus had given them a good answer, he asked him, “Of all the commandments, which is the most important?”  &gt; “**The most important one**,” answered Jesus, “is this: ‘Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one. Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.’  **The second** is this: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’  (Mark 12: 28-31, NIV)  Of course, if you care about Biblical Context, Jesus is hardly Mr. Sweetness and Light. Remember, many Christians find it more comfortable to believe in a god who doesn't condone, command or commit murder, slavery, rape, child abuse, animal abuse, arson, torture, ritual mutilation, fratricide, patricide, matricide, infanticide, genocide, and so on than to believe in one who does. Unfortunately, since the Bible (Old Testamant and New) is pretty clear about Yahweh's position on these things, holding a belief in Loving Hippie Jesus™ requires ignoring huge portions of it. Or just never reading it in the first place, which seems to be the most popular option.  Well, let's say what Jesus has to say about that:  &gt;“Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished.  (Matthew 5:17-18, NIV)  Some Christians claim that his death and resurrection ""fulfill"" this. That is bullshit for one simple reason: last time I checked, Heaven and Earth haven't passed away.  Jesus also made his views on people ""picking and choosing"" quite clear:  &gt;[Jesus] answered them, “And why do you break God’s commandment because of your tradition? For God said:    *Honor your father and your mother;* and, *The one who speaks evil of father or mother must be put to death.*  &gt; But you say, ‘Whoever tells his father or mother, “Whatever benefit you might have received from me is a gift committed to the temple”—  he does not have to honor his father.’ In this way, you have revoked God’s word because of your tradition. Hypocrites! Isaiah prophesied correctly about you when he said:    &gt;These people honor Me with their lips, but their heart is far from Me.  They worship Me in vain, teaching as doctrines the commands of men.”  (Matthew 15:3-9, NIV)   Looks like Jesus has quite a bit to say about people who ignore commandments, in fact. But maybe it's just Matthew?  &gt;It is easier for heaven and earth to disappear than for the least stroke of a pen to drop out of the Law.  (Luke 16:17, NIV)  Okay, so Jesus is a bust. Let's see what the Epistles have to say about the Mosaic Code:  &gt; If you really keep the royal law found in Scripture, “Love your neighbor as yourself,” you are doing right.  But if you show favoritism, you sin and are convicted by the law as lawbreakers. For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it.   (James 2:8-10, NIV)  &gt;All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness,  (2 Timothy 3:16)  &gt;Do we, then, nullify the law by this faith? Not at all! Rather, we uphold the law.  (Romans 3:31)  &gt;Know this first of all, that *there is no prophecy of scripture that is a matter of personal interpretation*, for no prophecy ever came through human will; but rather human beings moved by the holy Spirit spoke under the influence of God.""  (2 Peter 1:20-21 NAB)  Well, shit.   This problem disappears quite quickly if you assert that most of the Bible is hogwash, and you only care about the good parts. If you prefer to cling to it as an inspired document, vague mutterings about ""context"" or about Jesus abolishing the old Law won't get you anywhere.  ",™

What do you do with your friends, why should a lady want to accompany you? 7. Private thing should be a little more clear on whether you enjoy those things on other people or wearing them yourself.  either is actually fine, ambiguity is not. 8. Remove casual sex 9. Make ""message me if"" more compelling.  it should have some bite to it, something that makes it easy to start a conversation.   Photos...  The first one is okay, the rest need to go.  Presentation. The facial hair in your 2nd and 3rd photos is not sexy. If you're going to rock it, make sure it's clean and well trimmed.    I don't know about Wisconsin, but long hair went out of style a long time ago over here on the west coast, especially pony tails, and especially if you have thin (I don't mean thinning) hair.  If you can bring yourself to, cut it off.  Spend a good $40-$60 on a really nice haircut from a professional.  I think you already know this, but I should mention it anyway.  You're going to need to hit the gym and modify your diet. you can go hardcore and work out 4x/week if you want, but I think you'd stand a better chance of success if you went and saw a personal trainer and nutritionalist a couple times a month for guidance.   I would also encourage you to check your fashion sense.  You don't need to go all Sperrys and polos, but some nice clean non-printed shirts,  well fitting jeans, and stylish shoes goes a long way.

t5_2qhk3,Doctor_Loggins,1341952850,"     12:01 PM, October 07, 2010  Rebecca said...      Personally, my preference is for circumcised, although it's not a dealbreaker - I've been with one guy who was uncut and he kept clean so it was fine, although we did have recurring issues with condoms. But overall I think circumcised looks hotter and is better for oral.      I'm not sure what I would do for a hypothetical son, but I would definitely want input from my hypothetical husband. I have sympathy for the position that it's painful, but I don't think it causes long-term damage. Even in the blog post linked to by Joel, the guy didn't have a problem with being cut until he started reading anti-circumcision propaganda. I also don't know any guys in real-life who wish they weren't cut, but I do know several who wish they were, including the aforementioned bf, so ultimately it seems less cruel to do it when they won't remember.     12:42 PM, October 07, 2010  The life of a stay at home mom said...      @Joel. I agree with you completely.     6:09 PM, October 07, 2010  Joel said...      learning about the practice for what it really is is not ""anti-circumcision propaganda""      If a man wants part of his body removed.. that's his choice. What if he said, ""oh, I wish my mom knew I wanted a tattoo because it hurts too much to get it done now that i'll remember!"" or ""oh, I want my nipple pierced, but it would hurt, my mom should have known to do it for me as a baby.""      At least neither of those remove thousands of nerve endings.      Is that anti-circumcision propaganda? To let someone know that they lost thousands of nerve endings? That they lost sexually-functional genital tissue?      Women have been perfectly happy to be genitally mutilated in Africa, despite living their entire lives without their clitoris (which is arguably far more important than a foreskin)... BUT THEY DIDN'T KNOW what they were missing.      Now that many of them realize that the clitoris is the favorite body part of many women, of course they're not going to be so ambivolent about the practice any more (though many still are).      Does that mean the practice of cutting the genitals of baby girls is okay?      (also for the record, there are many forms of female genital cutting, some are far less extreme than male circumcision, and some are far worse, in terms of damage caused... all forms of female genital cutting are illegal in North America, and for good reason).      I wouldn't say you aren't ""allowed"" your preference, but I think it's about on par with a man saying he prefers baby girls to have their genitals cut because he thinks it looks hotter and is better for oral.     10:14 PM, October 07, 2010  Purple Froggie Clay Stuff said...

I'm a circumcised homosexual guy.      Like Joel said, I used to be okay with (and oblivious to the detriments of) circumcision. I have recently acquired for myself an uncircumcised boyfriend, and at the same time, a daily reminder of what I'm missing. I've since done research online and have gotten pretty irrevocably sad about the state of my junk. It might seem ridiculous to you, and it might at one point have seemed ridiculous to me, to hear men talk about how they feel ""mutilated"" or ""damaged."" The truth is, it's simply not anyone's place to, like Joel said, diminish someone else's pain because he or she can't empathize.      Enjoy your circumcised men all you want, but please leave the decision to circumcise up to the participant of the surgery.      For my own part, I think uncircumcised penises are sexy, and quite frankly, I'm presented with daily evidence of how much more sensitive and just plain FUNCTIONAL they are than my own.      I hope circumcision is made illegal very soon.     9:31 PM, November 28, 2010  Brazilianbloke said...     This comment has been removed by the author.      4:21 PM, November 29, 2010  Brazilianbloke said...      I got circumcised when I was 20. I know some people say that sex feels different and that circumcision ruined their sex lives but it hasn't ruined mine at all. Of course it is a bit different as there is no foreskin but it doesn't necessarily mean it is worse now. It is just different but equally good. Lack of sensitivity? That is not true! Am I impotent due my circumcision? Not at all! I can ejaculate without any problems. Now my penis looks a lot neater, cleaner and nicer I have mo complains and sex is great.     4:31 PM, November 29, 2010  evil p0ptart said...      Thank you Brazilian Bloke, it's nice to hear it from someone who has experienced it from both sides. I'm glad you cleared up the lack of sensitivity question. As I knew that was not necessarily true, or men would not be able to ejaculate in a minute whom are circumcised!     11:52 AM, December 07, 2010  Joel said...      @evil_p0ptart - how long it takes for a man to ejaculate is based on many factors - such as one's experience level, their current state of mind, and very importantly, the strength of their pc muscles. Their technique, thrust style, and breathing all play large roles as well, as well as the way that they masturbate and how frequently.      The foreskin is extremely sensitive tissue, and contains thousands and thousands of highly specialized nerve endings, like those in the fingertips and lips - neither your fingertips or your lips, despite feeling amazing when stimulated, make a person ejaculate faster or slower. They just feel good. It's actually deep-pressure nerve endings, primarily found in the glans, that trigger orgasm. But there is SO much more to having a rich, sensory, pleasurable sexual experience than just orgasm. Does circumcision ruin that ability? In most cases no, but it certainly takes away something substantial that many men would not willingly give up.      Another thing that is valuable to the owner of a a foreskin is it's mobility (the way the skin moves back and forth) especially during self-pleasure, this is an invaluable tool.      Hopefully that clears up a bit of the confusion.      Also.. I am curious why someone would get circumcised at age 20. Possibly something that was keeping him from enjoying his foreskin? Could that not have effected his ability to fully appreciate the sensations it provides many men? Just a question.     8:46 PM, December 07, 2010  Boobies said...

Happy to be circumcised... I had to have it done at the age of 3 for medical reasons so I honestly don't recall what it would be like to have foreskin. I wouldn't change it for the world though. As for a finished sensitivity... If that is the case than I am double happy because I wouldn't be able to cope with any more... I'd be ejaculating if someone was to simply look at it ;)     1:30 PM, June 12, 2011  Mit©helangelo said...

t5_2ryez,Mookiie2005,1341953171,"Backstory incase you missed it:  Google recently sent this letter to many merchants that list their wares on Google Shopper.    ""Dear Merchant,  We're writing to let you know about some upcoming changes to the product listings you submit to Google. As we recently announced, we are starting to transition our shopping experience to a commercial model that builds on Product Listing Ads. This new shopping experience is called Google Shopping. As part of this transition, we'll begin to enforce a set of new policies for Google Shopping in the coming weeks. A new list of the allowed, restricted, and prohibited products on Google Shopping is available on our new policy page - Google Shopping policies - NEW - Google Merchant Center Help.  Based on a review of the products you're currently submitting, it appears that some of the content in your Merchant Center account, ****************, will be affected by these policy changes. In particular we found that your products may violate the following policies:  Weapons  When we make this change, Google will disapprove all of the products identified as being in violation of policies. We ask that you make any necessary changes to your feeds and/or site to comply, so that your products can continue to appear on Google Shopping.  To help you through this new set of policies and how to comply with them, we would like to give you some specific suggestions regarding the changes needed to keep your offers running on Google Shopping.  Weapons As highlighted on our new policy page Google Shopping policies - NEW - Google Merchant Center Help, in order to comply with the Google Shopping policies you need to comply first with the AdWords policies AdWords Policy Center - Advertising Policies Help. We do not allow the promotion or sale of weapons and any related products such as ammunitions or accessory kits on Google Shopping. In order to comply with our new policies, please remove any weapon-related products from your data feed and then re-submit your feed in the Merchant Center. For more information on this policy please visit Weapons - Advertising Policies Help.  We're constantly reviewing our policies, and updating them when necessary, to ensure we're offering the best experience possible to our users. We've identified a set of policy principles to govern our policy efforts on Google Shopping in the U.S. These principles are:  1) Google Shopping should provide a positive experience to users. Showing users the right products at the right time can truly enhance a user's experience. When people trust us to deliver them to a destination that's relevant, original, and easy to navigate this creates a positive online experience to the benefit of both users and merchants.  2) Google Shopping should be safe for all users. User safety is everyone's business, and we can't do business with those who don't agree. Scams, phishing, viruses, and other malicious activities on the Internet damage the value of the Internet for everyone. Trying to get around policies or ""game the system"" is unfair to our users, and we can't allow that.  3) Google Shopping should comply with local laws and regulations. Many products and services are regulated by law, which can vary from country to country. All advertising, as well as the products and services being advertised, must clearly comply with all applicable laws and regulations. For the most part, our policies aren't designed to describe every law in every country. All advertisers bear their own responsibility for understanding the laws applicable to their business. Our policies are often more restrictive than the law, because we need to be sure we can offer services that are legal and safe for all users.  4) Google Shopping should be compatible with Google's brand decisions. Google Shopping must be compatible with company brand decisions. Our company has a strong culture and values, and we've chosen not to allow ads that promote products and services that are incompatible with these values. In addition, like all companies, Google sometimes makes decisions based on technical limitations, resource constraints, or requirements from our business partners. Our policies reflect these realities.  We've given much thought to our stance on this content, as well as the potential effect our policy decision could have on our Merchants, and we apologize for any inconvenience this may cause you.  Sincerely,  The Google Shopping Team  © 2012 Google Inc. 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043 You have received this mandatory email service announcement to update you about important changes to your Google Merchant Center account.

I was performing the role of Wedding Guest With Camera, I had a tonne of fun at the wedding, and I got all the shots I was interested in.  The shots they keep posting on facebook aren't the Wedding Shots, they're my candid snaps (which believe me are nothing **at all** special, but actually capture the fun of the event).  I think that freedom to follow your eye is incredibly valuable in capturing events, yet is generally squashed flat by the requirements of the Wedding Photographer™ role, and that's a shame.  I would think that more Wedding Photogs would do better to have a rover that was absolutely separated from all the Wedding Shot rigamarole, a rover that would be there just to hang out take fun pictures.

The link was very text heavy so here are the salient points.   ""Monsanto's SDA omega-3 soybeans also advanced to Phase 4. SDA omega-3 soybeans offer a sustainable, land-based source of SDA that readily converts to the heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acid found in fish oil. Last year, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a Generally Recognized As Safe notice affirming that the SDA omega-3 soybean oil could be used in a variety of foods. Food companies can now formulate and test the oil from SDA omega-3 soybeans in food products for future launch. Clinical studies have shown that consumption of SDA omega-3 soybean oil significantly raises blood levels of the heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acid EPA, also found in fish and fish oils.""  ""Vistive® Gold - The Vistive Gold trait, formerly known as Vistive       III, delivers a trans fat free, reduced saturated fat soybean oil with       increased stability for frying and baking applications. The company       recently completed submissions to the U.S. Department of Agriculture   and FDA in support of the Vistive Gold trait. Vistive Gold soybeans       advanced to Phase 4 in the pipeline. Oil from Vistive Gold soybeans       will have monounsaturated fat content similar to olive oil and low       saturated fat content like canola oil. This will allow the food       industry to cost-effectively eliminate trans fats and significantly lower saturated fat content of food products.""  From monsanto.com:  PHASE FOUR (Prelaunch) Key Activities: Regulatory submission, Seed bulk-up, Pre-marketing Average duration: 12 to 36 months(2) Average probability of success(3): 90 percent ",®

t5_2qh1i,DonaldQVega,1341988059,"What about this toothpaste?  Theodent: http://theodent.com/index.html  Patent: http://www.google.com/patents/US5919426?dq=nakamoto+theobromine&amp;ei=DPn8TrbkMOnnsQKzoY2eAQ  ------  From Theodent's FAQ page: http://theodent.com/faq.html  What makes Theodent™ different or better than other toothpaste? Theodent™ toothpaste represents the only major toothpaste innovation in over a century. Theodent™ harnesses the power of patented, Rennou™, a non-toxic proprietary blend of a naturally-occurring extract found in chocolate blended with other minerals that help to strengthen the enamel surface of human teeth.  How did you discover this? Like all great discoveries, this one came by pure accident. Researchers found, a particular extract from chocolate, that was similar in structure to caffeine, had a beneficial effect on teeth. Whereas caffeine stunts enamel growth, Rennou™ actually helped to stimulate the growth of new enamel.  How does it work? Your enamel is made up hundreds of thousands of calcium and phosphorus unit crystals which form the mineral component of enamel, hydroxyapatite. Theodent™ with Rennou™ increases the size of the surface unit crystals of your enamel by four times. Larger unit crystals make your teeth less susceptible to bacterial acid de-mineralization and keep your teeth healthy and robust.  Can you prove it? We already have! We have two patents issued by the United States Patent and Trademark Office. We have another patent pending and research has been conducted by Tulane University, The LSU school of Dentistry, The University of New Orleans, Marmara University Dental School, University of Texas in San Antonio, &amp; the American Dental Association Foundation. Abstracts available from the Journal of Dental Research &amp; patents available through the US Patent and Trademark Office.  --------  - I found out about this toothpaste a while ago, and have used it. It's a lilttle pricey at about $10 a tube, but it seems to be working.   ",™

It's an insult how much we pay from the discounters here when you can cross an arbitrary line into Cornwall or Hawkesbury and see that they can sell things for MUCH CHEAPER EVERYDAY PRICES.  Not only that, SuperC on the island is especially a joke. They're bait-and-switch. ""Oh, here's all this shit on sale. It's sold out and we're not getting any back.

t5_2tnz9,Illuminatesfolly,1341996469,"Perhaps what follows is just a pedantic difference, but you are confusing ""Biological Reason"" with ""Adaptationist Reason"". Everything to do with human behavior and society has a biological explanation (since ""biological explanation"" means nothing other than ""it exists in the world as it is"", a pleonastic tautology in itself). Seldom in evolutionary theory does the *Richard Dawkins®* style adaptationism of the popular Reddit biologist give the full or correct explanation of evolutionary history.   Reddit is prone to giving ""Just-So"" stories of evolution. Where it is true that some part of our early history likely influenced the emergent property that they are describing, it is often the case that the complexity and pure stochastic probabilism of what is being described are ignored outright.   Much of Reddit knows fuck all about Evolutionary theory, and as a genetic engineering student, it is fucking painful, which is why I tend to stay in /r/biology (which also has it's problems) when I am interesting in an evolutionary explanation for a trait.   Evolution is driven by Natural Selection, of course, but it is also confined by ecological interaction, shifted by the drift of random chance and influenced in ways that the human brain just doesn't normally consider, to put it simply. This is why biological scientists that study ecology and evolution apply rigorous statistical treatments of available evidence, to avoid the plausible, but incorrect explanations that we tend to construct in the absence of conflicting evidence.   Always remember, a hypothesis is different than a consistency of suggestion.   **META** I understand the implications of offering ""the human brain doesn't think in particular ways"" as an explanation of why adaptationist reductionism is a bad model for evolutionary theory.

t5_2qm4e,knockingon2043,1342065804,"""Eye drops are used to treat several conditions, including glaucoma, allergies, general redness and dry eyes. Prescription eye drops, of the sort used in the treatment of glaucoma and certain severe allergies, carry explicit instructions on how many to use at a time as well as the total number of eye drops that can be safely used in one day. Similar precautions are included in the packaging of over-the-counter eye drops, such as Clear Eyes® and Visine A.C.® Nevertheless, many people ignore these instructions, using eye drops whenever they feel the slightest discomfort.  Those who have followed the advice of Ben Stein and used eye drops to “get the red out” may be surprised to learn that overuse of these drops can increase eye redness and actually bring about the conditions that they are trying to correct.  Naphazoline, one of the active ingredients in Clear Eyes®, is used in stronger quantities in prescription-only eye drops and treats redness caused by pollen, smog, and other irritants. With overuse, this ingredient can instigate a laundry list of side effects, including dizziness, headache, increased sweating, nausea, weakness, nervousness, decrease in body temperature, and slow heartbeat. The potential side effects from overusing prescription eye drops with other active ingredients are similarly unpleasant, and include vomiting, troubled breathing, and back pain.  Other Possible Side Effects: Dilation of the blood vessels within the eye gives the appearance of redness on the surface of the eye. Common causes of red eyes include extremely dry air, sun exposure, dust, foreign body and an allergic reaction. Derivatives of the medication imidazoline, antihistamines and corticosteroids are ingredients found in over-the-counter eye drops used to relieve eye redness, burning, irritation and dryness caused by exposure to environmental elements.  Rebound Eye Redness: Rebound eye redness is a side effect of overuse of eye drops intended to relieve eye redness. Imidazoline works as a vasoconstrictor, causing the narrowing of blood vessels. Over-the-counter eye drops work quickly to reduce redness, but do not eliminate the cause of the redness. Rebound redness results because the blood vessels in the eye dilate as the effects of the medication in the drops wears off. Overuse of eye drops to relieve the symptom without correcting the cause sets up a cycle of dependency and misuse. Eye drops should be used only as directed, and are not intended for long-term use. According to MayoClinic.com, when over used, eye drops containing imidazoline can cause permanent redness and damage to the blood vessels in the eye.   Eye Irritation: Some brands of eye drops contain an antihistamine in addition to imidazoline. An antihistamine blocks histamine, a chemical released by the immune system in response to an allergic reaction. Histamine dilates blood vessels. Eye drops containing both an antihistamine and any derivative of imidazoline will relieve redness by constricting blood vessels. MayoClinic.com warns that eye irritation is a side effect of this type of eye drops. Symptoms include watery eyes, headache, and a mild stinging or burning of the eyes. Eye inflammation is a risk for users who wear contact lenses.   Eye Infections: Eye drops that contain a corticosteroid work to reduce inflammation associated with an allergic response, radiation or foreign object. This type of prescription eye drop is intended for short-term use. If symptoms are not relieved in two days, the patient needs to be reevaluated by the physician. According to Drugs.com, bacterial, fungal and viral infections of the cornea are associated with prolonged use of eye drops containing steroids. Prolonged use suppresses the immune system’s normal defensive response and increases the risk of eye infections.  As it turns out, even something as seemingly benign as eye drops can be harmful if overused. The key is everything in moderation! Don’t use eyes drops more than you need to!""  Sources: http://tabish.me/health/is-frequent-use-of-eye-drops-like-visine-or-clear-eyes-bad-for-you/  http://www.livestrong.com/article/175250-side-effects-of-over-using-red-eye-drops/",®

t5_2qh2p,knobtremor,1342076138,"&gt; By saying this I assume you're also implying that a Theist's judgement is not supported by fact.  No - I didn't state that. I stated an Atheist must always have his judgement based in fact. (Because he does not believe in a god or gods, so there is no real alternative to fact and science)  A religious person can do this too. But when they lay claim to having knowledge because it's god will - thats where I call BS!  &gt; That amuses me, because while scientific evidence can give further evidence of something being true, it can never really be a fact. Because I'm quite positive that a fact is what is known as general knowledge assumed to be true.  From definition of fact  &gt; fact [fækt]  &gt;n  &gt;1. an event or thing known to have happened or existed  &gt;2. a truth verifiable from experience or observation  &gt;3. a piece of information get me all the facts of this case  &gt;4. (Law) Law (often plural) an actual event, happening, etc., as distinguished from its legal consequences. Questions of fact are decided by the jury, questions of law by the court or judge  &gt;5. (Philosophy) Philosophy a proposition that may be either true or false, as contrasted with an evaluative statement (Law) after (or before) the fact Criminal law after (or before) the commission of the offence an accessory after the fact as a matter of fact, in fact, in point of fact in reality or actuality fact of life an inescapable truth, esp an unpleasant one the fact of the matter the truth [from Latin factum something done, from factus made, from facere to make] factful  adj  &gt; Collins English Dictionary – Complete and Unabridged © HarperCollins Publishers 1991, 1994, 1998, 2000, 2003  fact is not defined as something ""that a fact is what is known as general knowledge assumed to be true.""  It was common knowledge that the sun rotated around the earth, until it was proved that it didn't. We based that change on evidence that can be recreated and verified.  No, fact is something observed, and something able to be reobserved if the condition that lead to the observation can be re-created.  So indeed something can be ... *fact*. Objective fact. According to the second paragraph.  &gt; Now doesn't that sound absurd? Your argument that Atheists have better judgement because it's based on fact is invalid. You have a different judgement that you cannot say is right nor wrong from that of a Theist, who does in fact have the same level of judgement as an Atheist.  I can say my judgement is correct until a fact forces me to change my opinion on the matter. A religious person can do so too. But when they have invoked the ""lords will"" into the matter, I have yet to observe they do.  You seem like a nice person, so I would like to think, that I might be able to change your mind with facts.   And sleep tight!",©

Nothing like Heroes of Might and magic III. **Don't buy.** I could barely go after the first 3 missions because I was very bored. Notice how they put the ""heroes"" are the end. Totally different feel, I feel the management of armies is so different. However, it's still a decent game, just not worth the price.  **Portal 2** Absolute must! **BUY!** Do not even question it - BUY. If you ever played a video game at any point in your life, BUY.  **Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 3** Despite reddit's hate for call of duty, this a solid game, single player was very good. I feel I got my money's worth. **BUY if you like shooters**, otherwise pass. YES, it's basically MW2 again, but MW2 was a very good game. I paid $60 for it, I just did the campaign and I feel it was worth it.  **Crusader Kings II** - I'm not really in Civilisation/Europea Universalis.­ **If you are, must BUY.** Very well-rated as well, I played this one very little, and my feeling is that it's a tiny bit too expensive still. However, critics are good, and I can definitely see the interest in this gameé  **Legend Of Grimrock** - If you have any interest for RPG at all this is a MUST BUY. Hardcore dungeon crawler! Look at the screenshots, if you absolutely hate dungeons, do not get it. Very good graphics for an indie game. I feel this is the most underestimated game on the list. I don't regret the $20 I paid for this game at all. Puzzles are clever, etc.  **Total War Shogun 2** Very fine strategy games, one of the top games of 2011. **BUY.** This is one of the games I enjoyed the most. Obviously, it's samurai-era, with large scale battles. It might be compared to Mount and Blade in some ways, althought it's in my mind much more developed and clear. If you ever liked Starcraft, Age of Empires, buy this one without even thinking about it.  **Terraria** at $2.49 you can't go wrong. **BUY.** I won't even describe what it is and frankly you can buy this one eyes closed.  **Deus Ex: Human Revolution** Very solid shooter. **BUY.** Honestly, if you have any interest in shooters at all, this is the game to buy.  **Spacechem** - Kinda puzzle game, very well rated but I personally don't like it. Watch videos before you buy. Some people say it's the best game they ever played. **WATCH VIDEOS BEFORE YOU BUY**  **Mafia II** - Similar to GTA but in the 50s. **At this price, BUY.** I might even buy it again (I own it on PS3). If you liked games such as L.A. Noire, this is very similar (less the detective stuff)  **Rayman Origins** - If you have any interest for platform this is a **MUST BUY.** I am not a fan of Rayman personally, but if you ever liked any Rayman game, you can buy this game with eyes closed. With an average score of 86, it's rated almost as well as Diablo 3 (not an example, I know :P).  Verdict: An extremely solid first day with tons of great games. Your wallet is about to take a hit. But then again for the price of a new game ($59) you can easily get 400-500 hours of entertainment.  EDIT: More details added",®

Obama has never worked for the private sector in any major way, and has spent his entire life cloistered in the backstabbing fantasy-land of academia. As the psychologist Donald Norman said, ""Academics get paid for being clever, not for being right."" Obama has a lot of clever ideas, but how many of them have been right?   - In the 1990s, Mitt Romney shut down the Boston headquarters of Bain Capital for several days after the teenaged daughter of one of his co-workers went missing. The Bain bigwigs gave up millions in profits to relocate to NYC and work full-time on finding the girl. When has Obama done anything similar?   - As governor of Mass, Mitt Romney cut over $1.5 billion from the state's deficit. The state had a budget surplus at the end of his term.   - Under Romney's policies as governor, unemployment in Mass. dropped by several percentage points.   - Romney and the Mass legislature passed a new law giving free in-state tuition to the top 25% of graduating high school students.   - Romney and the Mass legislature passed a law giving free tuition to military personnel returning from active combat duty, and he appointed the state's first-ever head of veteran affairs to the state cabinet.   - Romney signed a bill giving substantial public funds to the construction of low-cost housing.   - Romney had the balls to call out Obama's failure to address the rising unemployment of blacks in his speech to the NAAPC.    **edit**  Obama has taken more campaign money from Bain Capital personnel than Mitt Romney has: http://rt.com/usa/news/obama-wall-street-financial-319/ ",®

t5_2snuc,cabbagery,1342145289,"It was done in a basic text editor (gedit), not any special logic software (though evidently there are several proof assistants available -- I may give some of them a try). I use Linux (Mint 11, presently), which includes a feature called the ""compose key,"" which is basically a super-intuitive version of the Windows alt-key combinations for special characters. If you want a special character, you simply type your compose key, then type the characters which, when combined, would produce the special character:  * ü = [compose key] + 'u' + ' "" ' * ç = [compose key] + 'c' + ' , ' * £ = [compose key] + 'L' + '-' * ® = [compose key] + 'o' + 'r' * → = [compose key] + '-' + '&gt;'  The standard list of compose key combinations doesn't include the biconditional or the quantifiers (nor does it include modal operators, which I also use), but I can either customize the list (which I have done in the past), or locate them in the character map and save them in a text file for easy access (which is what I currently do).  When I write out a proof, I usually use some shorthand notation in a text editor (nothing fancy) until I see that the proof is going somewhere, after which point I'll copy the list of special characters to the clipboard and shore it up formally. Sometimes I even include dependencies (usually only when the proof is complicated enough to warrant it), and I use a mixture of traditional notation and Graeme Forbes' notation (which is probably not **his**, *per se*, but I learned it from him, so he gets the credit).",®

t5_2swgo,LifeMask,1342192800,"I said to Kmart before the race that I hadn't properly tested my setup in terms of tyre management. He remarked that it looked like it could be heavy on the tyres, but the options lasted for 8 laps in P1 so I thought I'd be good - even with limited testing.  Had a great qualifying session, being on pole by over a second and thus felt confident going into the race, and was even happier to see the dry start. Had a good first few laps, pulling out a lead of about 3 seconds, but by lap 4 my front left was nearly delaminating and so I pitted for primes. Kmart and Herp pitted a few laps after me and when order was resumed I found myself with a 9 second lead. My primes were starting to go after about 5 laps and I saw my first sector time was seven tenths off the pace. I did the quick maths in my head and decided to switch to a three-stop strategy as I seemed to have the pace over the other guys. After my 2nd stop and coming out in 3rd, Herp was about 9 seconds ahead and I was only closing the gap by about 4 tenths a lap, and I was still burning through tyres  - my tactical blunder was realised, and I was in damage limitation mode.  Of course, this didn't go as planned, as I picked up a drive through and a time penalty for the patented LifeMask CornerCut™. Decided to switch to intermediates as the rain started to fall but they blistered way too early. Crossed the line second but got knocked down to 4th with the penalty, and didn't overtake anyone on track for the whole race.  Fantastic driving by Kmart to win by such a huge margin, chalking this one down to just one of those bad weekends for me.",™

t5_2qlr2,maledicted,1342194003,"It does not cheer me up either. In fact, I deliberately avoid coming here when I'm high.  I just always figured thusly:  &gt; isn't that somewhere a sign that we are more/just slightly more in troubles than the others? Therefore we have a problem?  Yes we are. And yes we do. We're more sensitive. Like it or not, fair or not, that's just how it is. It's tempting to view it as one-dimensional, but the truth is, like most things in life, it simply isn't.  &gt; I mean, if we were just different, we would have a subreddit and that's it. But when I read in this subreddit, all I see are mostly motivation speeches and consolations.  I guess that's just the reddit demographic. Pick any random subreddit, hell, any random community on the internet; chances are it's gonna be mostly consisted of teens and folks in their twenties. A lot of *those*, in turn, are in such a place in their lives that they need validation and just being able to relate to someone. Each generation has their own thing; you can't hold it against them/us. I was a fucking disaster at age 15 and believe me, a social circle like this, even if only on the internet, would've helped me a lot.  What I'm saying is: people are whiny bitches. We hurt, we need a hug once in a while, and no matter how many divergent subreddits you create they'll still find you. So I figure you might as well be patient and try to help.  ----  Is introversion a disability? Of course not. But the way the world works right now favors extroverts. Is it fair? I guess not. Sucks if you're an idealist, but no one said it would be. But even then you still have a choice. You can sit down and cry and victimize yourself because it sucks (I'm not gonna lie, that's what I've done most of my life), or you can push back and try to make what you can out of it.  Oh, and in conclusion:  &gt; for me being an introvert is a social handicap, so more than a difference, perhaps even a problem  Every difference is a social handicap. Think about it. Communication can only be perfect in a homogenous mass of identical people; where everything means the same for everyone. Unless you want that, you have to take the bad with the good. You barter out of what position you're in. Grab those ""differences"" and ""problems"" and make them work for you. Your life's road is covered with sharp rocks that murder your metaphorical feet any time you take a step? Collect that shit and open a Sharp Rocks™ store. There's someone out there that walks on neat round pebbles and just wants to skin their metaphorical mammoth.",™

t5_2qh2p,Volcris,1342200007,"&gt;A site like Reddit is overwhelmingly male (well in the range of 80%) and this subreddit, even more so.  20% doesn't mean a strong presence amongst millions? That's over 1.6 million women you just considered a weak demographic. Nice job  &gt;TIL tweets where a grown man argues with 14 year old Bieber fans is a rallying call  yes, because humor bridges gaps faster then long winded arguments.   People like you think that reading Dawkins and Nietzsche are the only paths to being a True Athiest™ and the rest of us should stop trying to have fun.   No I don't think his posts are enlightening, or insightful, hell I don't even think they are particularly effective. I think they are liberating. I think after growing up hearing about priests committing rape, watching an entire party of the government decay to religious zealotry, reading about the death of women who asked to be treated as equals in the middle east, I deserve, every once in a while, to sit down and laugh. I deserve to say ""ha! Yes! Pop culture is retarded, poorly contrived statements of faith are retarded, and a large number of people believe that too!"". I deserve to take a brake from the grim realities of the world, and the complex issues that have to be addressed to face those realities, and pick on low hanging fruit. That's what keeps me in the game.   It doesn't matter what the truth is, it never has. A good lie can have more real impacts on the world then the truth, because we don't live in a world governed by reality. We live in a world entirely governed by the whims and beliefs of men. Every once in a while, I enjoying seeing statements flourish that laugh at those who believe lies. It gives me hope that the truth will have it's day.   So you can keep you cynicism. I'm far happier laughing with the crowd, knowing I will still study, contemplate and debate the truths of life with as little assumptions as my human failings will allow, because I need the cheap laughs just as much as I need the careful insight. It's the only way to keep optimistic in a world with a decided lack of optimism.  ",™

t5_2qh03,quebecsol22,1342200203,"**Spellforce Platinum Edition** I liked this game. Graphics are a tiny bit outdated. In my mind, if you want this game, get the 2 for just like $3 more. **DON'T BUY**  **Spellforce 2** A GREAT rpg with good graphics, plus one expansion for free - if you have interest for rpg you must **BUY** especially given the low price. You might not have heard of spellforce a lot; the game is great, well worth the money (also 80 on metacritic!).   **SpellForce 2: Faith in Destiny** IMO the rebate is not great enough to justify an immediate buy... Play the original game first. It should be enough. **DONT BUY**. This ""expansion"" is also fine (don't me wrong, by no means a bad game) but spellforce 2 is better.  It should be noted that like mass effect, spellforce continue the same story. You might want to get spellforce 1 just to get continuity, but my personal recommendation is to get spellforce 2 and just play it :)  **DARKSIDERS** One of the games I enjoyed the most. Very good graphics. Very fun to play. Action game, playing in a demonic invastion. **MUST BUY**  **Sanctum** I did not like this indie game. Felt empty. I had more fun with Super meat boy, trine, journey or such. Personally would not get it, but am not a fan of tower defense. At $2.50 it's a BUY but this is one of these games in your library you might never play. **DONT BUY**  **Hoard** Very fun game for a few hours. You are a dragon. Instead of always building a town and defending, you now attack! I liked the game, and it's really really cheap, but I would still recommend **DONT BUY** given all the games available.  **Super Street Fighter IV** One of the best fighting games ever. Tons of tournaments of it. Obviously you buy this one for multiplayer. Amazing deal. **BUY if you like fighting games**  **Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter® 2** This is the hardest game for me to rate. At $2.49 it's a **BUY** but realize this is a very strategic game - nothing like call of duty modern warfare 3. Its multiplayer is also quite dead, although there are still people playing it. It's a good deal for a very fine game.  **From Dust** An open world game. I really hated this game. It's very different from anything you've played: you use power to freeze rivers and have ""tribals"" pass over it, you move sand and earth, etc. Overall one of the games who disappointed me the most. **DONT BUY**  **The bindings of Isaac** Another indie game, at $1.24 don't even ask the question and **BUY** it.  **Anno 2070** I want to recommend not buying this game just because of the shitty DRM, but I do believe they changed it. Look at the amazing screenshots: this is similar to Sim City, although at the same time very different.  A gorgeous, very fun game, **BUY if you like sim city**.  **Tribes: Ascend - Steam Starter Pack** Beware! Tribes: Ascend is free to play. For $4.99, you get 50% bonus XP forever, bonus weapons, more chars, more perks and more gold. **Play the free game first, if you like it, buy it**.  **Sonic: generation** They say there hasn't been a decent sonic game since the gamegear. This one is good, not great. Very colorful, very fast, and none of the weaknesses of the previous entries in the sery. I do feel it's a tiny bit too expensive so I am going to recommend **DONT BUY** unless you're a Sonic fan.  **Max Payne 3** One of the best games I've played this year at an attractive 50% rebate. **BUY**  **Payday: the heist** This is not a bad game, but it's also one of these games that will sit in your library forever. Kinda repetitive. I played this one for a few hours, and the price is definitely attractive, but I'mma going to recommend **DONT BUY**",®

La banda se encuentra de gira por EEUU. El músico había alquilado una moto para hacer un trayecto largo y tuvo un accidente del que se desconocen cómo fueron las causas.  El golpe en la cabeza que sufrió obligó a que sea asistido en el CTI de un hospital de Nueva Jersey, por lo que el grupo decidió suspender la presentación que iban a tener en Nueva York.  El jueves por la noche, la banda informó en sus redes sociales que “Curuchet tuvo un accidente en New York”, y que su estado era “reservado”.  Este viernes por la mañana NTVG comunicó que la situación era “delicada”. “Queremos agradecer a todos quienes se preocupan por la salud de Marcel. La situación en estos momentos es delicada. Lo que debemos hacer ahora es estar juntos y mandarle la energía más positiva posible”, informó la banda este viernes por la mañana en sus redes sociales.  No Te Va Gustar se encuentra de gira por México y EEUU, donde presenta su último disco “Público”.

Every man that tempts another; every fallen spirit that is engaged in this; every book, picture, place of amusement; every charm of music, and of song; every piece of indecent statuary; and every plan of business, of gain or ambition, are all under the control of God. He can check them; he can control them; he can paralyze their influence; he can destroy them; compare Matthew 6:13.  (3) there is a certain extent to which we are able to resist temptation. There is a limit to our power. **There is a point beyond which we are not able to resist it.** We do not have the strength of angels.""  http://bible.cc/1_corinthians/10-13.htm  And then this guy pulls a saltnlight...  ""(5) if people fall into sin, under the power of temptation, they only are to blame. **They have strength to resist all the temptations that assail them**, and God has given the assurance that no temptation shall occur which they shall not be able, by His aid, to resist.""  http://bible.cc/1_corinthians/10-13.htm  Amazing.  ""**There is a point beyond which we are not able to resist it.**""  And...  if people fall into sin, under the power of temptation, they only are to blame. **They have strength to resist all the temptations that assail them**,   So there ""is a point beyond which we are not able to resist it.""  *and*  We ""have strength to resist all the temptations that assail"" us.

t5_2qh2p,Dudesan,1342239878,"Remember, many Christians find it more comfortable to believe in a god who doesn't condone, command or commit murder, slavery, rape, child abuse, animal abuse, arson, torture, ritual mutilation, fratricide, patricide, matricide, infanticide, genocide, and so on than to believe in one who does. Unfortunately, since the Bible (Old Testamant and New) is pretty clear about Yahweh's position on these things, holding a belief in Loving Hippie Jesus™ requires ignoring huge portions of it. Or just never reading it in the first place, which seems to be the most popular option.  Well, let's say what Jesus has to say about that:  &gt;“Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished.  (Matthew 5:17-18, NIV)  Some Christians claim that his death and resurrection ""fulfill"" this. That is bullshit for one simple reason: last time I checked, Heaven and Earth haven't passed away.  Jesus also made his views on people ""picking and choosing"" quite clear:  &gt;[Jesus] answered them, “And why do you break God’s commandment because of your tradition? For God said:    *Honor your father and your mother;* and, *The one who speaks evil of father or mother must be put to death.*  &gt; But you say, ‘Whoever tells his father or mother, “Whatever benefit you might have received from me is a gift committed to the temple”—  he does not have to honor his father.’ In this way, you have revoked God’s word because of your tradition. Hypocrites! Isaiah prophesied correctly about you when he said:    &gt;These people honor Me with their lips, but their heart is far from Me.  They worship Me in vain, teaching as doctrines the commands of men.”  (Matthew 15:3-9, NIV)   Looks like Jesus has quite a bit to say about people who ignore commandments, in fact. But maybe it's just Matthew?  &gt;It is easier for heaven and earth to disappear than for the least stroke of a pen to drop out of the Law.  (Luke 16:17, NIV)  Okay, so Jesus is a bust. Let's see what the Epistles have to say about the Mosaic Code:  &gt; If you really keep the royal law found in Scripture, “Love your neighbor as yourself,” you are doing right.  But if you show favoritism, you sin and are convicted by the law as lawbreakers. For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it.   (James 2:8-10, NIV)  &gt;All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness,  (2 Timothy 3:16)  &gt;Do we, then, nullify the law by this faith? Not at all! Rather, we uphold the law.  (Romans 3:31)  &gt;Know this first of all, that *there is no prophecy of scripture that is a matter of personal interpretation*, for no prophecy ever came through human will; but rather human beings moved by the holy Spirit spoke under the influence of God.""  (2 Peter 1:20-21 NAB)  Well, shit.   This problem disappears quite quickly if you assert that most of the Bible is hogwash, and you only care about the good parts. If you prefer to cling to it as an inspired document, vague mutterings about ""context"" or about Jesus abolishing the old Law won't get you anywhere. ",™

I don't have the time to explain that, but look up interpersonal communication and reciprocity. Also, check out the Heman Women Haters Club: r/seduction and look up NG. No girls allowed; it's a secret.  Expansion:   In Intro to Interpersonal Communications, I learned that studies have shown that people like having nice things done for them, but only if they have an opportunity to do something nice back. Relationships are reciprocal. If a person doesn't have the opportunity to reciprocate or if you do so many nice things that they are overwhelmed by how much they feel compelled or obligated to reciprocate, they will no longer enjoy your company but feel burdened and guilty in your presence. If you are being 'too' nice, you are not being nice at all, you are actually making people uncomfortable and not taking their needs and perspective into account. People prefer others who are somewhere in the middle. This occurs independent of gender. If you really want to be nice to people then you will give them a bit of breathing room; don't smother them with kindness.",™

Would you forgive me if I post here some copy-pasta if it has to do with occult stuff?  ---   I'm gonna describe someone, and you stop me when you know who he is and why it's important...  He was a Brigadier General and a States Attorney General.  In the war with Mexico he fought a pistol duel with his commanding officer.  He manged to kill thousands of Indians by hurling them against Lincolns' army, after he won the battle he manged to lose all his gains in the counterattack. (He was Americas chief Indian negotiator. his actions killed more Indians than any man that ever lived.)  He's the only confederate officer to be pardoned after the Civil War.  He's the only confederate officer to have an outdoor statue of himself in Washington DC. (At the foot of ""judiciary Hill"".)  His body lies behind/**under glass in a topless pyramid they call a ""Temple""** on 16th st. in down town Washington DC. (Google-earth: 38°54'49.28"" N 77°02'09.20"" W) *(You couldn't make this stiff up!)*      Is that kind of spooky? 16th St. is in the center of DC and would run through the oval office if it kept going.   Henry Kissinger recently republished 8 of his books. (Henry Kissinger will headline an event for Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney later this month in Connecticut)  I could go on, but maybe you get the point.  What I'm getting at, is, this dude is not exactly a ""nobody"".  150 years ago he devised a plan for WW1 and it happened exactly as he suggested it should right down to the last detail. He also planed WW2 and it happened exactly as he had planed. He also planed WW3... Are you beginning to get the picture?  His name is Albert Pike. Google ""Albert Pike, 3 world wars"" and LOL at the Ashkenazi (Converts to ""Jew"") Jews, and why they are being allowed to act as the they have. (When he talks about ""a new religion"" that is code for ""science"".) See: [Ask.com:Lucifer-defined](http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20101012155338AAXt25a)       Please see that ""Ask"" link, it's of utmost importance!  TL;DR: The war must be conducted in such a way that Islam (the Moslem Arabic World) and political Zionism (the State of Israel) **mutually destroy each other**. *(Keep in mind, Persia (Iran) is not ""Arabic"" in language or geography., and has the largest population of NON-European (real) Jews than any other nation on earth.http://www.sephardicstudies.org/iran.html)* *Hitler suggested Persia change it's name to Iran which means ""Land of the Aryan"" and considered them full blooded Aryans. See: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP38kyQukWY*  Q: If you had not one racist bone in your body, what would a ""race"" have to do to you, for you to want to kill that ""race""?  A: What ever your answer... TKS! That is exactly what they need to do to get this ball rolling!  From: http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/khazars1.asp (That's from Fordham University)   In the year 740 AD there were a few Israelites and the king and subjects of a huge powerful kingdom was to convert to one of three religions en-mass, and were tricked into not converting to ""Israelites"" but converting to ""Jews"" (Notice how the king was corrected about the difference by the Christin):  &gt;On the third day he called all the sages together and said to them. ""Speak and argue with one another and make clear to me which is the best religion."" They began to dispute with one another without arriving at any results until the King said to the Christian priest ""What do you think? Of the religion of the Jews and the Muslims, which is to be preferred?"" The priest answered: ""The religion of the Israelites is better than that of the Muslims.""   &gt;The King then asked the kadi [a Muslim judge and scholar]: ""What do you say? Is the religion of the Israelites, or that of the Christians preferable?"" The kadi answered: ""The religion of the Israelites is preferable.""   &gt;Upon this the King said: ""If this is so, you both have admitted with your own mouths that the religion of the Israelites is better Wherefore, trusting in the mercies of God and the power of the Almighty, I choose the religion of Israel, that is, the religion of Abraham.  But they still even today use their Babylonian Talmud.  And so that brings me to this: Revelation 2:9. I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou art rich) and I know the blasphemy of them which *say they are Jews, and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan.*       Please remember Satan and Lucifer are not the same thing.  (What would Jebus do?)  Now here is a nifty little blood test that can tell the difference: http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Health/genetics.html (Notice how they specify Ashknazi European ""Jews"")  ---   Sorry for spamming you. What I'm trying to say is Israel is a tool to get rid of Christian, Jew, Muslim, and replace them with ""science"". At least that's the way I see it ATM.   Again, my most humble apologizes. ♥",♥

Used with the permission of the University of Hawai`i Press.  Hannas's background is more as a linguist in the sense of speaking a bunch of languages rather than theoretical, so I would be curious for some academic linguists' impressions on his book. i found it informative (although it clearly had an axe to grind if I recall, for better or worse).  @guohuade i would say it is not productive to focus on the computer example. whoever said it was a bad thing to create a transparent and easy to say compound like diannao? calquing is easier for native speakers, loan words are easier for foreign learners. who is to say what is better in principle?  @CRCulver, would you concede that there are gradations in terms of how phonotactically disallowed various strings are that an alphabet could exploit? For instance, I have a lot of trouble reliably producing a word-final h but I can produce a word initial ts just fine. If we wrote english with a syllabary we wouldn't be able to have the word ""tsetse fly"" in the same form, so the orthography would be what was restricting the fidelity of the phonetic loan.",©

Prior exposure to the relevant HPV types contained in the vaccine can actually *increase* the risks the vaccine is intended to reduce.  See [Gardasil™ HPV Quadrivalent Vaccine - May 18, 2006 VRBPAC Meeting](http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/ac/06/briefing/2006-4222B3.pdf) (PDF)  &gt; There were two important concerns that were identified during the course of the efficacy review of this BLA.  One was the potential for Gardasil™ to enhance disease among a subgroup of subjects who had evidence of persistent infection with vaccine-relevant HPV types at baseline. The other concern was the observations of CIN 2/3 or worse cases due to HPV types not contained in the vaccine.   These cases of disease due to other HPV types have the potential to counter the efficacy results of Gardasil™ for the HPV types contained in the vaccine.

You're using paragraphs, and that's all you need. :)   I understand what you mean about online communication vs. being in person. The former can never replace the latter.   The weather— I hear you! I can tolerate anything *except* humid heat. That's exactly how it is right now. :( Feels like trying to breathe under a wet, wool blanket. Yuck!  &gt;the cultural differences are many and varied and frankly we as westerners could never get past them  I'm glad you said that, because I used to wonder why my friends' families weren't terribly receptive to me. I've had friends from many different parts of Asia, and I always felt a sort of a... wall(?) between their relatives and me. We were *only* friends, same gender, blahblah, but still, there was always a divide.  &gt;Think about marrying a Japanese girl or a Chinese girl, how hard it would be to overcome all the societal differences;  Oh, I think there would be more concerns than just the societal differences. :p (I'm teasing you because I'm not a guy), but I do understand the point you're making. Speaking of which, on a sidenote— if you hang around reddit long enough, you're going to run into a spammer whose ONLY purpose is to post pictures of asian men in relationships with white women. Just thought I'd put that out there, lolol!   &gt;My life in Bangkok from 2001 to 2006 needs to be kept a secret, trust me;   I completely understand that, and I appreciate your honesty. It boils down to self preservation, an instinct we all have. I detest not telling the full truth in certain circumstances; but that 'honest quality' came back and kicked me so many times, it altered my belief in divulging 'everything.'   &gt;the girl I am seeing now won't be in the picture long...   I will actually never get into a long-term relationship ever again.  It's weird, OP, that even though I don't know you, it makes me sorry to hear that. :( I dunno, maybe that's the romantic in me, always wanting to hear that happily-ever-after can happen. (Too much Disney in my childhood! &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;)  &gt;the cultural and language differences rear their ugly head every day.  I know how you feel. :( I've been there, done that.

It is a systemic devaluation of femininity that creates the rigidly defined masculinity by which men must abide. If men have a problem with masculinity as it currently exists, perhaps they should consider increasing the social status and viability of femininity in all people. They could also address the notion that femininity and masculinity are not mutually exclusive.  &gt;Feminist men need to understand that their liberation from standards of masculinity goes hand in hand with smashing patriarchal misogynistic social structures.

t5_2qh3l,neil_obrien,1342391590,"Distinction between debit and credit is pretty basic.  When you use debit (select debit on the POS terminal and key your PIN) you are giving your authorization to ""debit"" your account immediately.  This is why if you use ""debit"" at most locations (other than convenience stores) you would be asked if you want a refund in cash or back on your card, in the event you had to return an item, as most debit transaction bypass the ""pending"" stage on your checking account.  Now if you chose to use credit, the transaction is not immediately posted to your account, nor does it bypass the pending stage on your checking account.  Additionally, if you make a return, you have to wait 3-7 business days (reversed pending) before the credit appears in your account.  Also, of you have an account, with a bank that offers rewards purchases on your debit card transactions, those rewards usually only apply to transactions where you chose credit, and never apply to transactions where you chose debit, as those rewards are paid out from revenues that MasterCard™ and Visa™ make from merchant agreements with retailers.",™

From the way it ended it seemed like something may be possible. Please correct me if I am wrong or help give me a better understanding of things. It just needed time no need to rush into anything or get overly excited about anything. It was exciting though. BtrLatethenNvr is finally having things go his way. The following morning(This would be Friday the 13th i am referring to) i texted her in regards to her birthday and what she wanted to do. i told her that if i didn't go to the hospital again after a mountain biking session or have any other serious injuries that we would go out. I ask her if she wants to go out or stay in pretty much whatever it is her day its her choice. Later in the day she is out and about shopping and I ask if i can accompany her if i make it back in time to do some shopping myself ""Behind Every Well-Dressed Man Is a Woman of Taste"" like to follow that if and when i can. I was a couple states away. She is out but says we will go shopping for ME on HER birthday. Little ridiculous and i insist we do something else. She sends me a photo of herself. I pay her compliment with saying she looks nice and that cute girls never send me pics blah blah blah. she says her phone is dying and she will text me later. I do indeed get a text from her later and i ask her about her shopping. She tell me how she didn't get anything and indulged herself in some pinkberry. When i took her out for ice cream i think in either my original or 2nd post i had offered to take her here cause i had never been and she denied. I asked her regarding this and she said that she would have felt bad. I ask her again about her birthday and she says we are shopping. Fine we can go shopping but for her not me. Its you birthday enjoy it thats how i see it. So i try to play it off in the sense that we can go an do what i want but then go and do something. I ask her plans again and when to get her. Not when and where just WHEN. She doesn't really reply back and i jokingly threaten her that i will stop talking to her if she doesn't allow me to do anything for her. She says i won't and i say that somebody is a little confident, that i might stop talking to her and what makes her think i won't.   The midnight hour is approaching. I am back from a day long mountain biking trip, I haven't been out seriously biking for two years. I met the ground several times that day along with a tree or two. I was sore to say the least but i made a note to draw a picture for the girl using the Crayola Crayon color that she loves and surprisingly enough was my favorite growing up that says happy birthday. I send it to her and Midnight on the dot and tell her to let me know about tomorrow. I don't get a immediate reply back but i do get a ""aww. i love it. then a couple minutes later followed by ""Aww i think you fell asleep sweet dreams"" So i go to work the next day and when i get out which is a good hour and a half to an hour before the time of six she said to get her i ask her is she still wants to go out. No reply. WTF all the previous nights of talking of you telling me your boyfriend forgot about your birthday and that you parents did too and its been shitty and that you want to make something work or something and you blow me fucking off. You have told me you have the whole weekend off. I have the unfortunate circumstance to find out that you did infact have some sort of either surprise plan or intended plan for Saturday after i have asked you to give me some of your time for me to do something for you. I am looking at your facebook profile which i haven't done in some time and i find out that you were at the beach on friday no boyfriend though. two days earlier he came to work with roses and food for you. You have pictures posted and you have admitted to others along with me that you HATE ROSES. When i sent you that picture at midnight you were on the phone with either you bestfriend at the time or you boyfriend. You thank all your friends and family and your ""Wonderful boyfriend"" for your birthday. Then today you are out with your family and ""hopefully spending time with my wonderful boyfriend ♥""            ",♥

t5_2qh55,djeclipz,1342420212,"Recipe:  The king of the Q in these parts is clearly Rockin Ronnie Shewchuk. His newest book, ""Planking Secrets"" by Whitecap Books is the bible to planking. Here is one of my favourite recipes from one of his many…  1 cedar cooking plank, soaked overnight or at least for 1 hour ½ cup Jack Daniels Whiskey 1 cup real maple syrup 1 tsp crushed hot red chilies 1 Tbsp butter at room temp 1 whole boned fillet wild Pacific salmon (3 pounds, skin on) kosher salt and fresh ground black pepper 1 tsp granulated onion or onion powder 2 lemons halved parsley sprigs for garnish 1 Tbsp finely chopped flat leaf Italian parsley For the sauce, combine the whiskey and maple syrup. Ina small saucepan, bring the mixture to a low boil and reduce by half. The mixture should coat the back of a spoon. Add the chilies and butter, stir, set aside and keep warm.   Season the skinless side of the salmon with salt, pepper and onion. Let the salmon sit for 10-15 minutes at room temperature until the rub is moistened.   While the salmon is sitting, preheat the grill on medium high for 5-10 minutes or until the chamber temperature rises above 500F. Rinse the plank and place it on the cooking grate. Cover the grill and heat the plank for 4-5 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium low. Season the plank with kosher salt and place the salmon skin side down on the plank.   Cover the grill and cook for 15 - 20 minutes or until the fish has an internal temperature of 135F. Check periodically to make sure the plank doesn't catch fire. Spray the burning edges with water if it does, making sure to close the lid afterwards.   When the salmon is done, squeeze half a lemon along its length and carefully transfer to a platter. Garnish with parsley sprigs and the remaining lemon cut into slices. Bring the salmon to the table. Drizzle a spoonful of the sauce over each portion as you serve and sprinkle with the chopped parsley.

t5_2r9po,ghirkin,1342462206,"I have only ever had this problem once. I was attempting to run TexMod with an older build and got the exact same error.   I will assume you are not using TexMod, or anything else which could possibly interfere with the way Direct3D draws textures. (I would advise disabling any 'in-game overlay' type software that you have installed. And have tried running gw2.exe as admin if on Vista or higher.  First thing to always try is *reboot* I know that being told to ''turn it off and on again.'' can be tiresome but it does sometimes fix these things.  If a reboot does not sort it:  The first two steps are to make sure you have the most recent version of DirectX 9.0c installed, to do that run the [DirectX End-User Runtime Web Installer](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35) from Microsoft.  The next step is to update your integrated video card's drivers, the easiest way to do this is to run the [Intel® Driver Update Utility](http://www.intel.com/p/en_US/support/detect?iid=dc_iduu) as it will automatically find the right driver for your hardware. Please note that you are installing graphics drivers, the tool may suggest to install other Intel drivers which you can ignore for now.  If neither of the above work, and you need to get the game to patch, you can use the Non-DirectX rendered launcher. To to this create a shortcut to gw2.exe and append -useoldlauncher to the target field. The properties window should look something like [this](http://i.imgur.com/O6RKc.png). Click Ok to save the settings and run gw2.exe from the shortcut. You will notice it uses a different launcher, and upon downloading all the files the game will start. It is possible with this being a DirectX-related issue (by the looks of it) that the game will crash at this point, however should a fix become available you will have all the files required to play.

Even if 99.9% of trades work out, it is not acceptable to just loose someone's money with only a ""Sorry, we can't do shit, please accept our apology :("". I understand Blizzard not wanting to just cut checks for every complaint, as someone said that would lead to hundreds more people just trying to BS Blizzard and hope they get some free money. If the Auction House isn't built in a way where Blizzard can easily trace item transactions and see where they failed, who got money, who didn't, and where the item landed... well either their lying or they seriously fucked up when designing the RMAH.  That said, I really hate reading this stuff from Cinemablend. Their articles are as biased against Diablo 3 as Fox News is against Democrats, and I'm not talking about the article content, I'm talking about the tone in which it's written. The content is fine, I just wish it was written in more of an objective manner. Look at the recent 'Resistance not working with Armor' issue, which turned out to be false, here's a quote from CB's article:  ""On the bright side, at least this news is a lot less damaging than say, some guy losing money to the RMAH and Blizzard saying they can't help him at all, or some other guy who can't get his $200 back while it's trapped in limbo, or some other guy who lost $149 to a grey area pocket of the RMAH.  In terms of the Diablo III Hate Meter™, I'd say this bit of news is quite tame and ranks rather low, probably fitting in somewhere around the ""Diablo III has bugs but this isn't that bad unless this bug forces you to buy better items from the Auction House"" scale.""  The RMAH issue comment wasn't necessary for the article, the last sentence is crap, and it reads like it was written by some pissed off forum goer they found on the Blizzard forums. And really, if you write for a website, you should act a bit more professional than pissed off forum posters.",™

It's weaker than proofs in the Coq/Agda sense (if that's what you mean), but that would be awesome for new collections developers, who would already have their work done regarding the properties testing.  And second, why don't you apply the same rant to, well... every typeclass available on Hackage? And in package 'base' (incidentally our already existing core) to start with? Because now, it appears you don't only condemn ClassyPrelude but the whole typeclass system.

For centuries, Maronesian healers have used precious extracts of the tropical muskmelon to regulate blood sugar. And now scientists recognize what natural practitioners have always known: The bioactive compounds in Glucobate™ increase insulin production by regenerating sensitive beta-cell receptors  — in effect, rebooting your pancreas to restore healthy functioning.  &gt;But don't just take our word for it. Clinical studies presented at the 2004 Triennial Symposium of Diabetology prove Glucobate™:  *      Reduces blood sugar by 53% and returns pancreo-peptide production to healthy rates. *     Stimulates glucose uptake, increases insulin production, and normalizes protein metabolism. *     Is 93% effective in reversing Type 2 diabetes and 87% effective in reversing Type 1 diabetes.   The reason I'm not joking is that is actually from a very clever **[anti-scam web-site](http://wemarket4u.net/glucobate/index.html)** published by the US FCA; click on any link on the page to see the rest. It is obviously crap and so is the herbal supplement pushed by the email you read for ***all*** types of diabetes. Which means that your company may be exposing itself to investigation by the FCA or even the FDA if they promote that book. If you are not in the US I am sure there will be equivalent organisations in your country.  You are in a tough spot as an employee; I don't envy you. Possibly the best way to approach it is to find an appropriate way to express concern to your superiors about the legal implications for your company of promoting this book and suggesting they discuss the matter with their legal advisors.  Even if it does not attract attention from the authorities, the lawyers need to consider the implications of civil action against them by the relatives of a diabetic who might die or be maimed from following the book's advice. There's a reason why I have a very large disclaimer that I am a diabetic, not a doctor, at the top of my blog and at the front of my book.",™
t5_2qpp6,Clbull,1342479238,"Reiterated, and yes. I can see ROOTAthene causing a slight sponsorship feud considering it was Razer that pretty much forced Destiny out of his own will to leave Quantic. He said in a HSCV interview that if he didn't leave Quantic, Razer would drop their sponsorship of the team. Although Quantic were happy with keeping Destiny onboard regardless, he didn't want players to miss tournaments because of what he did. How would Razer feel if they were suddenly in the situation where they were sponsoring a player of a team consisting of  a supposed 'racist' that they previously refused to co-operate with?  I'd imagine ROOT have enough publicity as it is considering they are a fan favourite team with a huge following that clearly didn't wane over the year-or-so the team was dissolved. And I doubt they'd bring Athene on board as a D3 PvP player due to the fact that D3's Coming Soon™ PvP system is pretty much unknown to everybody and may not even be remotely viable as an e-sport. Oh and due to the nature of D3 being ""gear or die"" and being a 'pay-to-win' game thanks to the Real Money Auction House... where the actual fuck would the skill be?

t5_2qh6c,cabbagery,1342479949,"&gt; [W]e should come to a realistic assumption [regarding which belief set is most commonly persecuted, if we make some unrealistic assumptions].  FIFY.  &gt; (If you like you can factor in the soviet and atheist regimes)  Oh? Then you don't mind if I factor in Hitler's persecution of Jews. We can probably ignore the millions of Jews who *survived* persecution in the wake of the Holocaust, and only count the six million who were killed in that event, and we'll still probably be a couple orders of magnitude ahead of Christian persecution.  But that would be unfair, I think, since not all of them were practicing Jews. Still, the institutional antisemitism prevalent throughout (especially European) history surely counts more in favor of Jewish persecution than Christian persecution, but hey, let's go ahead and just make some ""realistic assumptions"" on the matter, shall we?  &gt; But if you take into account that a) they are more outspoken b) [believe they] have something to gain c) there are magnitudes *[sic]* more of them, then it is within every means to make the assumption that they are *many* or even *most* of the cases of persecution. . .  Nope. If we confine ourselves to a period of time, then we'll have to make some pretty unfounded assumptions. Indeed, if there are so many more Christians, then it seems odd to say that they are persecuted so much more than minority groups living among them. How many Christians *are* in areas in which Christian-specific persecution takes place? It's hard to say -- in fact, it's damned near *impossible* to say with any degree of certainty. We cannot even safely assume that those who are publicly persecuted for being Christians actually *are* Christians -- I highly doubt very many (any?) of the 'witches' burned at Salem were *actually* witches -- and we haven't even broached the issue of being a True Christian™ yet...  No, we cannot make ""realistic assumptions,"" as you seem to think. We can make assumptions, yes, but they are not particularly realistic, and they hardly reflect the actual nature of things.  ---  Look. I understand if reading is difficult for you, but as I've said throughout, I don't think that any of you actually believe Christians are the only persecuted group (though apparently some of you think Christians are particularly singled-out for persecution, which I expect is ludicrous, given the ubiquity of Christian aid organizations and the religion's spread and influence). I *do*, however, liken silently allowing implications that Christians are more persecuted than anybody else to silently allowing implicit racism. It's incumbent upon us to explicitly recognize implicit racism or sexism, and it's just as well incumbent upon us to not silently let people draw improper inferences.",™

There are many quotes of him talking about how all he wanted to do was turn Star Trek into a new Star Wars type show. He has said before that he always thought Star Trek was stupid and dull and that it should have been a lot more like Star Wars.  Here's one related quote of his: ""Star Wars was always full of action."" Abrams explains ""If I had one criticism of the original Star Trek, itâ€™s that the show was often a lot of discussion about things that were happening and not a lot of action depicting it. That needed to change. So we looked at the ships, the feeling of battle and action and fights and all the stuff that makes a movie like this so exciting. It all needed to be done in a way that people had never seen before, and certainly never in a Star Trek movie.""  **EDIT - Another quote in which JJ basically just says Star Trek sucks:** ""JJA: Well, I’m just a fan of ""Star Wars."" As a kid, ""Star Wars"" was much more my thing than ""Star Trek"" was. If you look at the last three ""Star Wars"" films and what technology allowed them to do, they covered so much terrain in terms of design, locations, characters, aliens, ships — so much of the spectacle has been done and it seems like every aspect has been covered, whether it’s geography or design of culture or weather system or character or ship type. Everything has been tapped in those movies. The challenge of doing ""Star Trek"" — despite the fact that it existed before ""Star Wars"" — is that we are clearly in the shadow of what George Lucas has done.""

In short, I would say to abandon a  search for meaning, never tell yourself that it was fate that something did or didn't happen and do things without regret.

This error is often caused by incorrect use of the ""Strict"" document type with a document that uses frames (e.g. you must use the ""Transitional"" document type to get the ""target"" attribute), or by using vendor proprietary extensions such as ""marginheight"" (this is usually fixed by using CSS to achieve the desired effect instead).      This error may also result if the element itself is not supported in the document type you are using, as an undefined element will have no supported attributes; in this case, see the element-undefined error message for further information.      How to fix: check the spelling and case of the element and attribute, (Remember XHTML is all lower-case) and/or check that they are both allowed in the chosen document type, and/or use CSS instead of this attribute. If you received this error when using the &lt;embed&gt; element to incorporate flash media in a Web page, see the FAQ item on valid flash.

For instance, in most HTML and XHTML document types the ""type"" attribute is required on the ""script"" element and the ""alt"" attribute is required for the ""img"" element.      Typical values for type are type=""text/css"" for &lt;style&gt; and type=""text/javascript"" for &lt;script&gt;.     Error Line 400, Column 7: document type does not allow element ""style"" here      &lt;style&gt;.cat1,.cat1 .fc-event-skin,.fc-agenda .cat1,a.cat1,a.cat1:active,a.cat1:…      ✉      The element named above was found in a context where it is not allowed. This could mean that you have incorrectly nested elements -- such as a ""style"" element in the ""body"" section instead of inside ""head"" -- or two elements that overlap (which is not allowed).      One common cause for this error is the use of XHTML syntax in HTML documents. Due to HTML's rules of implicitly closed elements, this error can create cascading effects. For instance, using XHTML's ""self-closing"" tags for ""meta"" and ""link"" in the ""head"" section of a HTML document may cause the parser to infer the end of the ""head"" section and the beginning of the ""body"" section (where ""link"" and ""meta"" are not allowed; hence the reported error).

t5_2r4kq,ThereIsNoJustice,1342541767,"In practical terms, you can make the conversation as short as possible, but in terms of perspective, it's important to understand that no one can make you suffer. Another person can make you hear something, see something, and generally effect your senses. But whether you decide this is unacceptable/wrong/problematic is up to you.   Then people want to know how to take that view. I just finished reading a buddhist book (Sit Down and Shut Up) by Brad Warner which has a great story, which shows the difficulty in this:  &gt;A few hundred years ago a dude named Gensa, who later went on to be one of the great Buddhist teachers, was still a young monk. One day he gets fed up with the temple where he’s studying. He figures he’d be better off getting out and seeing what the rest of the world has to offer. Maybe another temple will have whatever it is he’s been looking for. Or maybe he’ll just give up on temples altogether. As he’s heading out the gate, he stubs his toe on a big ol’ rock. He’s hopping around in terrible pain, bleeding from under his toenail, going, “Ow! Ow! Shit! Piss! Damn!” And he thinks, “I’ve heard that the body is an illusion. So where the hell did all this pain come from?” All at once he gets it.  &gt;Later on, his teacher, a guy named Seppo Gisan, asks him what’s up, and he says, “I just can’t be deceived by others.” ...That one sentence, “I can’t be deceived,” says all you need to know.  &gt;When people say stuff like “I can’t be deceived,” the emphasis is usually on “I.” ... But that’s not what Gensa means here. “I” here is absolutely universal. It refers just as much to you and me as it does to Gensa himself. He’s not bragging. He might even be a little bit sad when he says, “I can’t be deceived.”  &gt;You’re probably thinking, Why would he be sad about that? I mean, he’s enlightened, right? And enlightenment is supposed to be the happiest thing that can ever happen to a person — just like Disneyland is the Happiest Place on Earth® — right? Otherwise why strive for it? But think about it for a sec. Imagine a situation in which you suddenly realize with absolute certainty that you can never blame anyone else... You can no longer tell yourself that if only this or that happened, then you’d find perfect happiness... It must be just a little sad. But it’s sad in a different way from usual sadness. It’s a sadness that knows what sadness really is. It knows that there is no merit in taking hold of sadness, so it lets the sadness drift by. Still, it’s not as if sadness isn’t part of the equation.  &gt;The idea that we can be deceived is an illusion created by our amazing ability to think. Real deception never happens. We pretend to be deceived. We even fool ourselves into actually thinking we believe we’ve been had. But it just doesn’t happen. When Gensa stubbed his toe on that rock — in other words, when he suddenly came face-to-face with the undeniable fact that he was living in this world and not in the world he created in his mind — he understood that he could not be deceived.",®

t5_2qh2p,Dudesan,1342546995,"Remember, many Christians find it more comfortable to believe in a god who doesn't condone, command or commit murder, slavery, rape, child abuse, animal abuse, arson, torture, ritual mutilation, fratricide, patricide, matricide, infanticide, genocide, and so on than to believe in one who does. Unfortunately, since the Bible (Old Testamant and New) is pretty clear about Yahweh's position on these things, holding a belief in Loving Hippie Jesus™ requires ignoring huge portions of it. Or just never reading it in the first place, which seems to be the most popular option.  Well, let's say what Jesus has to say about that:  &gt;“Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished.  (Matthew 5:17-18, NIV)  Some Christians claim that his death and resurrection ""fulfill"" this. That is bullshit for one simple reason: last time I checked, Heaven and Earth haven't passed away.  Jesus also made his views on people ""picking and choosing"" quite clear:  &gt;[Jesus] answered them, “And why do you break God’s commandment because of your tradition? For God said:    *Honor your father and your mother;* and, *The one who speaks evil of father or mother must be put to death.*  &gt; But you say, ‘Whoever tells his father or mother, “Whatever benefit you might have received from me is a gift committed to the temple”—  he does not have to honor his father.’ In this way, you have revoked God’s word because of your tradition. Hypocrites! Isaiah prophesied correctly about you when he said:    &gt;These people honor Me with their lips, but their heart is far from Me.  They worship Me in vain, teaching as doctrines the commands of men.”  (Matthew 15:3-9, NIV)   Looks like Jesus has quite a bit to say about people who ignore commandments, in fact. But maybe it's just Matthew?  &gt;It is easier for heaven and earth to disappear than for the least stroke of a pen to drop out of the Law.  (Luke 16:17, NIV)  Okay, so Jesus is a bust. Let's see what the Epistles have to say about the Mosaic Code:  &gt; If you really keep the royal law found in Scripture, “Love your neighbor as yourself,” you are doing right.  But if you show favoritism, you sin and are convicted by the law as lawbreakers. For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it.   (James 2:8-10, NIV)  &gt;All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness,  (2 Timothy 3:16)  &gt;Do we, then, nullify the law by this faith? Not at all! Rather, we uphold the law.  (Romans 3:31)  &gt;Know this first of all, that *there is no prophecy of scripture that is a matter of personal interpretation*, for no prophecy ever came through human will; but rather human beings moved by the holy Spirit spoke under the influence of God.""  (2 Peter 1:20-21 NAB)  Well, shit.   This problem disappears quite quickly if you assert that most of the Bible is hogwash, and you only care about the good parts. If you prefer to cling to it as an inspired document, vague mutterings about ""context"" or about Jesus abolishing the old Law won't get you anywhere. ",™

There are quite a few sweater patterns I've seen that rely on needle size changes for waist-shaping without affecting the stitch count.    I've use graduated needle sizes in calf-shaping on socks in order to keep a pattern but still have it fit my Ginormous Calves Of Doom™  As I normally knit on 2mm needles, I switched to 2.25, 2.5, 2.75,then 3mm  over about 24 rows, so the transition in gauge was gradual.    With a glove, you also usually have to increase for the thumb gore, maybe you can cast on for the small size glove, knit the wrist, and then increase evenly around to get to the number of stitches required to knit the medium size.   The only thing I can see as maybe going wrong with this would be you'd still have to fit those wrist parts over your hands.  ",™

I decided that creating a Lego version would allow me to have the flexibility to change the gameboard as I play-tested different sets of rules.  First, the rules and design aren't final. My main purpose was to recreate a piece of the books that I really loved and have fun doing it. I'll try to stay spoiler-free in my descriptions below.  My approach was to remain as close to how the game is described in the books. George R. R. Martin doesn't describe the rules to the game and, according to an interview, has no intention of doing so. However, he does give some specific description of the pieces and portions of gameplay. As much as possible, the board was created with those few details in mind.  The game, as I can best surmise, seems a combination of chess, Battleship, and chinese chess. I haven't made a final choice of the ruleset I'm going to use.

Some information/clarification on what you're seeing in the photos:  **The Wall**  ""as they arranged their tiles on either side of a carved wooden screen."" [ADWD]  I created my board with a screen in the center that can be removed. The screen sets where the river would be (based on the design of chinese chess). My wall was designed to be like the Wall in ASOIAF.  **The Pieces**  ""There were ten different pieces, each with its own attributes and powers,"" [FOC]  I've created ten different pieces. The final number of each piece is still not concluded. The pieces I've created are based on the few descriptions in the book and what others have surmised:  ▪ Rabble  ▪ Spearmen  ▪ Crossbowmen  ▪ Light Horse  ▪ Heavy Horse  ▪ Trebuchet / Catapault  ▪ Elephant  ▪ Dragon  ▪ King ▪ Mountains (explained below)  **The Mountains**  ""the board would change from game to game, depending on how the players arrayed their home squares.""

I'm playing with 4 mountains on each side. The mountains are set before the games starts and the screen/Wall is lifted. The mountains once set, can't be moved. There can not be more than two mountains in a single column or row.  **The Corners**  I designed the outside and the corners of the board to be stylistic and reflect scenes from the book. My four corners are:  1. The Knights Watch beyond the Wall  2. The forest is the Wolfswood.  3. The tower is one of the three waycastle's of the Eyrie.  4. The Iron Throne (yes, that's supposed to be Jeoffrey).  **The Colors**  I chose Red and Yellow as the two opposing sides to represent the Targaryens and the Lannisters.

t5_2rjz2,escielenn,1342580006,"After reading through the books, I was really wanting to play the game of Cyvasse. I decided that creating a Lego version would allow me to have the flexibility to change the gameboard as I play-tested different sets of rules.  First, the rules and design aren't final. My main purpose was to recreate a piece of the books that I really loved and have fun doing it. I'll try to stay spoiler-free in my descriptions below.  My approach was to remain as close to how the game is described in the books. George R. R. Martin doesn't describe the rules to the game and, according to an interview, has no intention of doing so. However, he does give some specific description of the pieces and portions of gameplay. As much as possible, the board was created with those few details in mind.  The game, as I can best surmise, seems a combination of chess, Battleship, and chinese chess. I haven't made a final choice of the ruleset I'm going to use. I'm currently testing it using rules based on the efforts of these sources:  http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Cyvasse http://asoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/topic/58545-complete-cyvasse-rules/  http://skitzinc.wikispaces.com/Cyvasse  http://gameofcyvasse.com/  My current ruleset is most like the ones described here: http://skitzinc.wikispaces.com/Cyvasse.  I've also used his suggestion of board size and expanded the chessboard from and 8x8 to a 10x13 (or 10x12 with a river).  Some information/clarification on what you're seeing in the photos:  **The Wall**  ""as they arranged their tiles on either side of a carved wooden screen."" [ADWD]  I created my board with a screen in the center that can be removed. The screen sets where the river would be (based on the design of chinese chess). My wall was designed to be like the Wall in ASOIAF.  **The Pieces**  ""There were ten different pieces, each with its own attributes and powers,"" [FOC]  I've created ten different pieces. The final number of each piece is still not concluded. The pieces I've created are based on the few descriptions in the book and what others have surmised:  ▪ Rabble  ▪ Spearmen  ▪ Crossbowmen  ▪ Light Horse  ▪ Heavy Horse  ▪ Trebuchet / Catapault  ▪ Elephant  ▪ Dragon  ▪ King ▪ Mountains (explained below)  **The Mountains**  ""the board would change from game to game, depending on how the players arrayed their home squares."" [FOC] ""He always sets his squares up the same way, with all the mountains in the front and his elephants in the passes"" [FOC] The Mountains are the gray sloped lego pieces on the board. I'm playing with 4 mountains on each side. The mountains are set before the games starts and the screen/Wall is lifted. The mountains once set, can't be moved. There can not be more than two mountains in a single column or row.  **The Corners**  I designed the outside and the corners of the board to be stylistic and reflect scenes from the book. My four corners are:  1. The Knights Watch beyond the Wall  2. The forest is the Wolfswood.  3. The tower is one of the three waycastle's of the Eyrie.  4.

Have a couple of them around, as hirelings or to be mulched by the enigma city encounters or the villain to show danger. * Ditch the 'kindly old man'.  His only job is to be confused, and to be the target of murder when you mind-control the PCs.  Replace him with the villain of the story who's a mad ~~scientist~~ wizard doing temporal shenanigans during a bid for Ultimate Power™. * Give the players clues for which way to go in the engima city.  Have random encounters of disasters or mosnter-critters (disasters: rogue fireball spell, huge crevasses to cross, building falling into the roadway) that all move as if coming from the villain's building. * The villian's building is safe from the temporal shennanigans, including anyone inside the building, and the only thing that survives the armageddon at the end of chapter 1.  Anything left outside the building (which hopefully isn't any PCs) doesn't survive.  This will give the players a good feeling for being in the right place at the righ time, instead of the grumpy from being mind-controlled into going in the ""right"" direction. * Let the PCs defeat the villain at the end of chapter 1.  Give the villain some ranting time that *hints* at what's to come in chapter 2.  ""Noooo!  You've ruined everything!  The power was to be mine, all mine, not yours!  Now I have to start all over!"" (paws at amulet, twists it, lurches into a portal to escape).   The players get the idea that they have to track this guy down again, and when they start to exhibit their own temporal shennanigans they'll have that ""a-ha!"" moment when they figure out why.  They'll also have a sense of how dangerous the villain can be (""if these powers of ours are shared among us from a ritual that was ruined, what would happen if only one person had powers from a ritual that was complete?  oh boy."")  Later, when the players have powered up from learning their abilities and just normal XP grinding, you can justify the villain being powered-up to match them as he spent the intervening time ""starting all over.""  And I'd start chapter 2 by literally dropping from fifty feet the one remaining building from the enigma city into the foothills of old America... because crawling out of wreckage and rubble just looks cool.",™

That doesn't really go with  &gt;gays = pedophiles  , you know?  &gt;Not that all are! but it is an all male organizational and might make some people uncomfortable,   Annnd again, bigotry. People are gay. You know what would happen if kids dealt with gay people? They'd stop being afraid of them and uncomfortable around them. And that isa *good thing™*   &gt;that is something that I would like to change  commendable, but weakened by the next sentence  &gt;I hope you can see why some people would be concerned and a small child doesn't know how to be explained to that being gay is okay and they wont do anything to you.  I do not see how they could be ""concerned a small child doesn't know how to be explained gay is ok"" and this fact not be considered proof of their bigotry.   ""Two people love each other and want to spend time together. "" ""And two boys or two girls?"" ""If they want this, then of course, this too""  Bam  ",™

t5_2qo4s,CurLyy,1342621927,"In NY the market is different then you cowboy folks.  None of the real fans go to games because the Garden is expensive as fuck.  We watch them from our couches, curse out our players, and our ownership, then tune in again the next night.  These fans that go to games, its like a social experiment.  NY is the most expensive city in the country, these are the rich folks who only go because its something to do.    Of course there are the season ticket owners who love the team but that's rare.    Anyway, my chime in on this topic is that racism is bad, but blind race pride is bad too.  Half the comments on here are also just Asian folks who never watched basketball before Jlin or Jesus lovers and don't realize the rockets already released him, and think NY is bad for letting him go.  Should be thankful we gave him a chance and D'antoni let him become what he did.  &gt;Congratulations to ~H♥ust♥n R♥cket &amp; J♥r♥my~ Sincerely hope that the new team and a new vision.  I don't have a problem with more basketball fans though, so in the end of the day its all good.",♥

While waiting for the rain to pass, we started taking back-lit portraits of each other in front of the lava flow after I set up my camera on the tripod.

t5_2r65t,waffleburner,1342637735,"&gt; Gay friend started dressing better, back in high school. So I started copying him, getting some plaids and all that. It looked ok, didn't really do much for me. Then when I got into college I noticed people treated me like shit if I wore a baggy hoodie around town compared to when I wore a nice sweater and jeans. All of a sudden everyone was nicer to me. And people listened more. At the end of the day I just like looking in the mirror and being like ""wow, i look like a baller today"".  Pretty much that. To add a little bit, I entered my first year of college and I was trying to figure out a way of selling myself better. Looking good, not in a conventional way but in a more unique method is an important part of the package. People should be able to recognize you based on your style. The way you dress is your business card of sorts. I don't plan on ever really wandering out into the world wearing an Indochino suit and a nice pair of Walnut Strands because that's generic in my mind and at this point, for me, it's excessive. You got to consider your budget when developing a style.  So, while for sure I haven't fully developed my style yet...and I've ballsed it up multiple times along the beaten path (of like, what, a year), I definitely look better than I did a year ago.

WELL F**K YOU THEN!  This is how a typical game of Endless Space plays out with me. I tried being the traditional “We come in peace” E.T. like Sophon’s and the second I mention trade or peace I get told to sod off! The same happened when playing with the Sowers and the United Empire. Well it’s no more Mr Nice Tilt! I’m going to make a stand. I’m going to play as the Cravers! The most evil, insectoid aliens the universe has ever seen. Not only that, the Cravers have a unique trait. PERPETUAL WAR!  With my war machines groaning their way into the battlevoid™ and my scout ships sneaking a peek at the back end systems of my enemies empire, I’m left with this strangely empty feeling. I love what I hear and see but I feel like it doesn’t love me back.  In many ways Endless Space is the perfect mixture of streamlined design and addictive gameplay. But this may also be the problem with it. It’s how a machine would construct a game. All of the essential ingredients that make it pretty and fun with none of the character. Civ has a distinct art style and though I’ve only ever played Civ V, I feel confident in saying that they all have a similar aesthetic. From menus to the tech tree, it has a very organic feel to it. Endless space does not.  Now I know that Civ is a triple-A funded game and of course it’s going to have more polish to it. But the problem is, this game is so similar that I have to make the comparison. It’s not that I don’t like the way ES looks. Quite the contrary, I love it. From the slick UI to the epic space battles, it looks truly fantastic but it just doesn’t have the charm. I don’t have that ‘MUST PLAY GAME’ feeling when I’m at work. I just don’t feel as drawn to come back for another galaxy stomp. But the time I do spend with it really does eat into my free hours. It has the same ‘just one more turn’ feeling Civ had. It shows you a good time but then leaves you and the following morning you wonder “Was she really worth it?”",™

Connecting multiple monitors for AMD Eyefinity technology couldn’t be simpler. There are four easy rules to remember:  1. The first two monitors can connect to the graphics card with any display output on your product: HDMI, VGA, DVI or DisplayPort. 1. The third (or greater) display must be connected to the graphics card via DisplayPort. 1. **If your monitor does not have a DisplayPort connection, you will need an inexpensive active DisplayPort adapter for it**. DVI to DP adapters can be had for less than $30 USD.2 1. Every family of GPUs supports a different maximum number of displays.  AMD Radeon™ HD 6500 Series and above support 4 monitors or more. I'd recommend these for price.  ----  I've modified your build to milk price/performance ratio as much as possible. Phenom II x4 for great multitasking, it will beat an i3 if you aren't gaming focused. 6670 for cost, but it can still run 4 monitors.

t5_2qhw9,Elliptical_Tangent,1342699207,"""The news"" is owned by 6 corporations at this point.  What comes across is the result of pandering to the advertisers for money and pandering to the people in power for access.  It's nothing you want to know... unless celebrity gossip is your thing.  As for credible sources, there aren't any in the absolute sense.  Understanding the truth of any given situation comes down to parsing the output of the media through an understanding of the world situation (resources are running out, and the rich are buying up what's left).  The reason RT and western media aren't agreeing on Syria is that Syria is a Russian client-state, in the same way Saudi Arabia is an American client-state.  The story is being spun differently by these two because one wants to keep the status quo, and the other wants to upset it.  The specifics are hard to nail down (and largely irrelevant), but it's essentially a proxy war for Syria's resources.  Same deal in Iran, but it hasn't become a war yet.  I say it's irrelevant to know specifics because it wouldn't matter if you knew.  The power in this country isn't in the hands of the people.  The lies are used to keep us quiet because a quiet populace is cheaper to deal with, not because they fear our taking power away from them.  As long as cops and soldiers take orders from above there's no fear of that (just look at OWS).  Even if we knew, and demanded a change, we'd be sold a candidate who promised Change™, and when elected, would naturally change not one thing.  The wealthy choose our candidates with election spending and they're not going to allow a candidate that's going to interfere with their game of musical chairs when it's so close to being over for good.  That was pretty bleak, right?  Well, the good news is you don't have to worry much about WWIII because that's not going to make anyone rich.  What makes people rich are engagements like Iraq, where knocking the country flat takes a few weeks at most, and then Haliburton, Xe, and the rest are on site for decades to extract the resources.  When oil becomes economically infeasible, the world will contract by orders of magnitude.

t5_2qmeb,ReiThePanda,1342700801,"♥ In the beginning, not really. After you have [](/s""beaten N at the Elite 4"") however, it becomes rather easy. Because of the modified Experience System you can take a freshly hatched Lv. 1 in to the Elite 4 and get it in to fighting shape in no time. Give it the Lucky Egg and let it lead out, then switch and kill as normal. I fought Sharpedo with a Lv. 1 Bulbasaur lead and it went up to Lv. 25 after I killed Sharpedo.  ♥ Aside from a rather unfulfilling quest [](/s""to find the Seven Sages (Minus Ghetsis)""), I don't know of much. The end of Black and White was left rather unfinished and it's rustled my jimmies. With luck though Black and White 2 will remedy this problem and add a bunch more content to the game, as it is lacking quite a bit post Elite 4 Round 2. I don't count the Dream World or any of that as part of the game content because you can only access that stuff with a computer.   ♥ As for 4th Gen, I would have to say Pearl and/or Soul Silver. I'd recommend getting both, as it will give you a much broader range of selection when it comes to making a team, as a great deal of Pokemon are unobtainable in the wild otherwise. If you know anyone who can lend you or if you can manage to get a copy of Sapphire or Ruby yourself, that would be even better, as you can transfer Pokemon you can't get on the other games to your 4th Gen via Pal Park and then on to your Black/White from there.

Rather, they're a symptom, as the obese do genuinely have greater energy requirements (and correspondingly greater hunger as well).  The roots of the obesity epidemic lie with constant snacking (especially on sugary shit like Twinkies, oreos, donuts, etc) and the composition of the modern American diet -- grain-, sugar- and vegetable oil-based processed foods, minimal vegetables, and low-calorie low-fat ""health food"" that is practically engineered to never satisfy hunger.

t5_2to85,AvidyaZen,1342727460,Yeah I was not as specific as I should have been because I was excited about the new PC hehe.    I have no grand plans for anything specific related to gaming other than to make videos when I feel the desire. I do have one Minecraft video in my head that I plan to make when time permits but I have no plans other than that. Doesn't mean I am not open to ideas just that I have no goals related to Minecraft at the moment.   I have always avoided Mods and SMP related Minecraft stuff maybe that is what I need to get infected with the blocky virus again :) Who knows.   I did commit to the Vizzle though because I would like to stay in touch with everyone and stay active for when I do have loads of time again. School is starting soon afterall and a new patch is coming :P    Thanks for the support and the laughs ♥,♥

But in 1901 William S. Harley, age 21, completes a blueprint drawing of an engine designed to fit into a bicycle, and in 1903 William S.

t5_2qore,dosman711,1342748004,"&gt;Dear Money,  &gt;Now that we've ignored your feedback for two months and we aren't making as much money on the RMAH as we hoped, I would like to take a step back and discuss how we can molest your wallets more effectively.  &gt;We've had an enormous amount of complaints since the launch. I speak for everyone at Blizzard when I say that you are loud and annoying and we hate you. We truly believe ""Every Dollar Matters,"" so I want to thank you for sharing your experiences in an effort to help us figure out how to be more subtle in our gouging. Your money makes it possible for us to continue developing Brother Kotick's vision of a micro transaction utopia, and we never take that for granted.  &gt;The launch week of Diablo III was obviously a debacle. The positive was that we made nine-hundred trillion dollars, the not so positive is that you couldn't play the game. We were thrilled that Diablo III made all of the money ever (topping even our most recent debacle). We've been so floored by the response that we all took three week vacations in small island countries and bought BMWs with toilets built into the seats. Frank Little in accounting bought a lifetime subscription to Cherry Trees Weekly. Guy's weird.  &gt;The launch had many challenges, chief among those being our insistence on always-online, our inability to properly gauge demand, our logistical incompetence in meeting demand and our unwillingness to spend the money necessary to ensure that we only ""double it"" when it comes to untested game mechanics, never to hardware infrastructure. However, I do not wish to apologize for the misstep--after all, it wasn't us who crashed our servers for three days straight. You did that. We will do our absolute minimum to conquer this for future releases if we feel like it.  &gt;In response to the immediate and overwhelming demand for a faithful followup to Diablo II, the team did everything they should have done a month previous to allow players to play the game they paid for. Despite these efforts, you keep crashing our servers by your insistence on playing the game. Rather than address this directly, I'll just say that even as we work to drive you away from the game and into the less-hardware-intensive Auction Houses, it's a sure bet your hardcore characters will die from lag spikes and server outages. We hope that our actions in the past have demonstrated that above all else, we're committed to keeping you paying for anything we make, no matter how rotten and cynical it actually is. Have faith and you will be rewarded. With $5.  &gt;We are not satisfied with only making nine-hundred trillion dollars; we want people to continue paying for Blizzard games for a very long time. The Diablo III team has made a passable, lukewarm and aesthetically pleasing experience. As such, our teams are working hard to fill in the gaps with all sorts of ancillary stuff. Kind of like how the frog DNA in Jurassic Park filled in the gaps in the dinosaur DNA and caused the dinosaurs to spontaneously change sexes. This is why Diablo is a woman. Because of the frogs.  &gt;You've seen some of that work already in patch 1.0.3, and you'll see additional ""improvements"" with patch 1.0.4. On the game balance front, this update will contain changes designed to further treat this game like WoW. We know that the ""2 trillion builds"" we touted before launch was perhaps a bit optimistic, but we would realistically like to get that number up to five. Maybe six. Per class. Another topic we’ve seen actively discussed is the fact that better, more distinct Legendary items are needed. We agree. I have no explanation whatsoever for why legendary items have been useless for two whole months, but Patch 1.0.4 will include new and improved Legendary items that are more interesting, more powerful, and more epic in ways you probably (hopefully) won’t be expecting, like extra frost damage or reflects damage back at attacker.  &gt;We're also working on a number of features that already exist, such as chatting with your friends, joining their games and seeing their achievements. In addition, we will be constantly improving the auction house since we know that's like super duper important to you all. This is how your money is being used. Thought you should know.  &gt;Regarding the real-money auction house, our primary goal for including this in the game was to provide convenience and peace of mind for those players who might otherwise turn to third-party services to buy items. Unfortunately that goal got lost when the guy in charge of itemization, Ned, had a stroke and the part of his brain that makes game design decisions leaked out his ears and into his cereal. Also, Ned has a hard time eating cereal anymore because the brains made him sick. Pray for Ned, please.   &gt;Anyway, the RMAH was created to protect you. We needed to keep you safe from the big, scary black market sites that all of you would, of course, be going to for items you couldn't find in-game because of Ned and his bad choices. It was never our intention for you to feel like the auction house is mandatory, so stop feeling like that. What are you, an idiot? We did it for your own good! Now you understand and we can all move on together.  &gt;One other common topic we’ve seen in the forums is the always-connected experience, and the perception that the online requirement is nothing but an ineffective form of copy protection that has already been cracked. While we’ve never said that this requirement guarantees that there will be no cheating or game cracks, we did strongly imply it was necessary because of all the cheating and cracks in Diablo II. Seeing that cheating and cracks still exist, we would like to divert your attention to this cute bunny: http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3XBUPZtl2hk/TkzFiB6HxgI/AAAAAAAAA_Q/z4rxNi333T0/s1600/cute+bunny+011.jpg.   &gt;Diablo III's always-connected requirement is necessary for, like, the integrity of the experience. If someone knows what that means, please email us. It's also necessary for us to support you playing with your friends (even if you don't have any), because we don't want you doing that yourself via a LAN. LANs are scary. A LAN once ate my friend. It's true. Look it up.  &gt;I know many of you are also looking forward to patch 1.1, our PvP update, which will come out in maybe 6 more months. We wouldn't want to just flip the switch and let people just attack each other. That would be a disaster! Instead, the PvP we're providing will provide a wonderful, controlled and constrained arena combat experience which will satisfy WoW players, which seems to be our primary demographic for some weird reason.  &gt;We're also doing some other things and stuff. It's going to be awesome. We can't give out any specifics but get excited!  &gt;As always, we pretend to care about your feedback and do whatever we want regardless. Just think of us as Congress.

t5_2qqjc,daleadil,1342749240,"###Chapter 4  **A**t a certain point, Nicholas White ran out of ideas. Anger and vindictiveness took root. He began to think, They, whoever they were, shouldn’t be able to get away with this, that he deserved some compensation for the ordeal. He cast about for blame. He wondered where his colleague was, why she hadn’t been alarmed enough by his failure to return, jacketless, from smoking a cigarette to call security. Whose fault is this? he wondered. Who’s going to pay? He decided that there was no way he was going to work the following week. And then he gave up.   The time passed in a kind of degraded fever dream. On the videotape, he lies motionless for hours at a time, face down on the floor.  A voice woke him up: “Is there someone in there?”  “Yes.”  “What are you doing in there?”  White tried to explain; the voice in the intercom seemed to assume that he was an intruder. “Get me the fuck out of here!” White shrieked. Duly persuaded, the guard asked him if he wanted anything. White, who had been planning to join a few friends at a bar on Friday evening, asked for a beer.  Before long, an elevator-maintenance team arrived and, over the intercom, coached him through a set of maneuvers with the buttons. White asked what day it was, and, when they told him it was Sunday at 4 P.M., he was shocked. He had been trapped for forty-one hours. He felt a change in the breeze, which suggested that the elevator was moving. When he felt it slow again, he wrenched the door open, and there was the lobby. In his memory, he had to climb up onto the landing, but the video does not corroborate this. When he emerged from the elevator, he saw his friends, with a couple of security guards, and a maintenance man, waiting, with an empty chair. His friends turned to see him and were appalled at the sight; he looked like a ghost, one of them said later. The security guard handed him an open Heineken. He took one sip but found the beer repellent, like Hans Castorp with his Maria Mancini cigar. White told a guard, “Somebody could’ve died in there.”  “I know,” the guard said.  White had to go upstairs to get his jacket. He demanded that the guards come with him, and so they rode together on the service elevator, with the elevator operator. The presence of others with radios put him at ease. In his office he found that his co-worker, in a fit of pique over his disappearance, had written an angry screed, and taped it to his computer screen, for all their colleagues to see. He went home, and then headed to a bar. He woke up to a reel of phone messages and a horde of reporters colonizing his stoop. He barely left his apartment in the ensuing days, deputizing his friends to talk to reporters through a crack in the door.  White never went back to work at the magazine. Caught up in media attention (which he shunned but thrilled to), prodded by friends, and perhaps provoked by overly solicitous overtures from McGraw-Hill, White fell under the sway of renown and grievance, and then that of the legal establishment. He got a lawyer, and came to believe that returning to work might signal a degree of mental fitness detrimental to litigation. Instead, he spent eight weeks in Anguilla. Eventually, Business Week had to let him go. The lawsuit he filed, for twenty-five million dollars, against the building’s management and the elevator-maintenance company, took four years. They settled for an amount that White is not allowed to disclose, but he will not contest that it was a low number, hardly six figures. He never learned why the elevator stopped; there was talk of a power dip, but nothing definite. Meanwhile, White no longer had his job, which he’d held for fifteen years, and lost all contact with his former colleagues. He lost his apartment, spent all his money, and searched, mostly in vain, for paying work. He is currently unemployed.  Looking back on the experience now, with a peculiarly melancholic kind of bewilderment, he recognizes that he walked onto an elevator one night, with his life in one kind of shape, and emerged from it with his life in another. Still, he now sees that it wasn’t so much the elevator that changed him as his reaction to it. He has come to terms with the trauma of the experience but not with his decision to pursue a lawsuit instead of returning to work. If anything, it prolonged the entrapment. He won’t blame the elevator. ♦   Read more http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/04/21/080421fa_fact_paumgarten#ixzz217gYM7X6",♦

Rather than address this directly, I'll just say that even as we work to drive you away from the game and into the less-hardware-intensive Auction Houses, it's a sure bet your hardcore characters will die from lag spikes and server outages. We hope that our actions in the past have demonstrated that above all else, we're committed to keeping you paying for anything we make, no matter how rotten and cynical it actually is. Have faith and you will be rewarded. With $5.  &gt;We are not satisfied with only making nine-hundred trillion dollars; we want people to continue paying for Blizzard games for a very long time. The Diablo III team has made a passable, lukewarm and aesthetically pleasing experience. As such, our teams are working hard to fill in the gaps with all sorts of ancillary stuff. Kind of like how the frog DNA in Jurassic Park filled in the gaps in the dinosaur DNA and caused the dinosaurs to spontaneously change sexes. This is why Diablo is a woman. Because of the frogs.  &gt;You've seen some of that work already in patch 1.0.3, and you'll see additional ""improvements"" with patch 1.0.4. On the game balance front, this update will contain changes designed to further treat this game like WoW. We know that the ""2 trillion builds"" we touted before launch was perhaps a bit optimistic, but we would realistically like to get that number up to five. Maybe six. Per class. Another topic we’ve seen actively discussed is the fact that better, more distinct Legendary items are needed. We agree. I have no explanation whatsoever for why legendary items have been useless for two whole months, but Patch 1.0.4 will include new and improved Legendary items that are more interesting, more powerful, and more epic in ways you probably (hopefully) won’t be expecting, like extra frost damage or reflects damage back at attacker.  &gt;We're also working on a number of features that already exist, such as chatting with your friends, joining their games and seeing their achievements. In addition, we will be constantly improving the auction house since we know that's like super duper important to you all. This is how your money is being used. Thought you should know.  &gt;Regarding the real-money auction house, our primary goal for including this in the game was to provide convenience and peace of mind for those players who might otherwise turn to third-party services to buy items. Unfortunately that goal got lost when the guy in charge of itemization, Ned, had a stroke and the part of his brain that makes game design decisions leaked out his ears and into his cereal. Also, Ned has a hard time eating cereal anymore because the brains made him sick. Pray for Ned, please.   &gt;Anyway, the RMAH was created to protect you. We needed to keep you safe from the big, scary black market sites that all of you would, of course, be going to for items you couldn't find in-game because of Ned and his bad choices. It was never our intention for you to feel like the auction house is mandatory, so stop feeling like that. What are you, an idiot? We did it for your own good! Now you understand and we can all move on together.  &gt;One other common topic we’ve seen in the forums is the always-connected experience, and the perception that the online requirement is nothing but an ineffective form of copy protection that has already been cracked. While we’ve never said that this requirement guarantees that there will be no cheating or game cracks, we did strongly imply it was necessary because of all the cheating and cracks in Diablo II. Seeing that cheating and cracks still exist, we would like to divert your attention to this cute bunny: http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3XBUPZtl2hk/TkzFiB6HxgI/AAAAAAAAA_Q/z4rxNi333T0/s1600/cute+bunny+011.jpg.   &gt;Diablo III's always-connected requirement is necessary for, like, the integrity of the experience. If someone knows what that means, please email us. It's also necessary for us to support you playing with your friends (even if you don't have any), because we don't want you doing that yourself via a LAN. LANs are scary. A LAN once ate my friend. It's true. Look it up.  &gt;I know many of you are also looking forward to patch 1.1, our PvP update, which will come out in maybe 6 more months. We wouldn't want to just flip the switch and let people just attack each other. That would be a disaster! Instead, the PvP we're providing will provide a wonderful, controlled and constrained arena combat experience which will satisfy WoW players, which seems to be our primary demographic for some weird reason.  &gt;We're also doing some other things and stuff. It's going to be awesome. We can't give out any specifics but get excited!  &gt;As always, we pretend to care about your feedback and do whatever we want regardless. Just think of us as Congress. The Congress of Fun™, and Jay Wilson is Joe Biden. Suck on that!  &gt;Always yours my sweet, sugary doves,  &gt;Mike Morhaime",™

Back in the good old days of Dos, doing Vsync was relatively easy. You had an interrupt that you called to basically wait for the drawing to be done before you did anything else. There was only one program drawing to video at once, so not really that big of a problem. Everything stayed in sync.  So, enter X, and the client server model. How do you draw with X? You send command after command through the buffer. Make a window here, draw a line over there, render a pixmap right there. This environment is simply ripe for tearing, with any attempt at doing real time graphics. X in it self can render everything smoothly, except the output from each of the windows. What happens is that each window draws at it's own rate, and that's not a problem, except for rapidly updating pixmaps. There's no real way to tell each individual client when it's safe to update it's pixmaps. Pix maps were designed for displaying static images.  So each client just mercilessly makes updates to the shared memory where the pixmap is stored.   This is more or less solved in windows, because instead of just pounding shared memory like a two dollar whore, it uses a callback based drawing system. Instead of just letting you hammer shared memory, you have to wait your turn to do your drawing. With some exceptions, drawing on windows has been more or less a tear free experience from the start.  Windows combines the Renderer, Compositor, Window manager, and Desktop all in one.  With Linux right now, you have X for the display server, Compiz, Kwin, Mutter, etc as compositing window managers, then all the rendering toolkits, some of which are accelerated, some of which are not, and they all accelerate drawing differently.   This all changes with Wayland, because wayland is the backend for EGL on Linux.  What is EGL?  http://www.khronos.org/egl/  &gt; EGL™ is an interface between Khronos rendering APIs such as OpenGL ES or OpenVG and the underlying native platform window system. It handles graphics context management, surface/buffer binding, and **rendering synchronization** and enables high-performance, accelerated, mixed-mode 2D and 3D rendering using other Khronos APIs. EGL also provides interop capability between Khronos to enable efficient transfer of data between APIs – for example between a video subsystem running OpenMAX AL and a GPU running OpenGL ES.   So instead of monkeying around with trying to get 4 or 5 different subsystems playing nice with each other, you just have one, Wayland, and it's designed from the get-go to take care of vsync issues.",™

Probably very badly explained on my part, but I can't be bothered checking some sources: the Google search bar is all the way over there! ↗",↗

t5_2qh0u,MerlinsBeard,1342803119,"Honestly? Yes, it does. The Brits love to depreciate themselves but they also relish depreciating everyone around them because that's just how they are. Most redditors from the US are counter-culture (and thus, hate McDonalds/SUVs/Pop Culture/other ""American icons"") are also pretty depreciative of the US as they feel it's shameful to have any pride in one's nation. [Comments like this are perfect examples](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/wuzka/my_dads_classic_mini_cooper_parker_between_two/c5gsbqw) of the prevailing sentiment on reddit about Americans. We're all scooter/SUV riding fatasses that are toting 5 guns and sipping on a MtDew while eating a fried chicken cheeseburger. No, really, I'm posting this from my Hoveround®.  I drive an SUV. I have countless uses for it and purposely chose one with a good efficiency but powerful 6-cylinder. I don't need an 8-cylinder as my 6cyl can tow around 2 tons without problems and still gets on average 19mpg with mostly city driving. I use it to haul around a plethora of things as well as the utility of being able to collapse all 5 of my back seats so my dogs have romping room on long trips (i.e. trips over 250mi/400km).   Of course you'll always have some asshole in a huge truck that bought it just because but most people see great utility in a truck/SUV. It has more to do with the rigid sense of independence that I honestly think (not a slight) that a lot of foreigners don't understand about Americans. We will, god dammit, do whatever we need to do without an ounce of help from anyone else.  At least in the US South you're looked down on if you can't do at least basic maintenance of your vehicle/home/property. You look like an asshole (not saying it's justified... that's just the way it is) if you order a replacement toilet/sink/etc and require it to be shipped to your house instead of packing it in your car.   TL;DR Most Americans are self-reliant and this is reflected with a vehicle that grants a large amount of utility and independence.",®

t5_2qh2p,Tachyx,1342814920,"&gt;Why are you doing that? Neither word is capitalized nor are they registered trademarks.  I'm trying to distinguish between these two words which have distinct definitions, but people also use them to identify themselves and groups. For example, by definition I am an agnostic, but I never identify myself as Agnostic® because I am not part of that group of people who do, and I would consider that dishonest.  &gt;Not all agnostic individuals have a religion.  This is irrelevant. The reason people identify as Agnostics® is because they are afraid of offending powerful people. Atheists aren't powerful.

How can I make these words different?  &gt;I doubt theists who might identify as agnostic in some sense are always offended.  People who get ""offended"" choose to do so, and they choose to do so because they are deeply committed to their religion. Self-identified Agnostics® are deeply committed to try desperately to NOT offend anyone, especially anyone with power. The problem is that people don't get offended by accident, it's a choice, and nothing you do can prevent it. Clearly, committed Christians and agnostics of any variety are totally separate groups.  &gt;I contend that ""unattached agnosticism"" isn't really a defensible stance, and amounts to ""I don't know what it is I believe and do not believe."" It's more of a stance of confusion, or transition.  While both of those are true, the reality is most unattached agnostics are just cowards. All religions teach that all other religions are wrong.

t5_2qh2p,thenaterator,1342816189,"&gt;The reason people identify as Agnostics® is because they are afraid of offending powerful people. Atheists aren't powerful.  You're overgeneralizing.  People identify as agnostic for a variety of reasons, including trying to soften their position.  They can also do so to be *clear* about their position, or because they don't *understand* their position, or the implications of it.  &gt; People who refuse to choose a political party because ""both sides are bad"" are the same sort as Agnostics®.  So you're strictly defining ""Agnostics®"" as people who identify as agnostic simply because they think atheists and theists are both wrong.  This is fine, but it's better to call them *confused,* because they clearly have an incomplete understanding of what it means to use the words agnostic, theist, or atheist.  It's ridiculous to equate independently (I assume American) registered voters to the sorts of people who label themselves agnostic to avoid controversy.  People label themselves Independent, again, for a variety of reasons.  Chiefly, I think it is apparent that they do so because no political party accurately represents their views.  &gt;People will continue to be ""bad"" if so many of you don't want to get involved.  Oh, so you're just compounding people who don't register or vote with major parties with people who aren't interested in participating in politics.  That's how it appears, anyway.  &gt;It leaves Atheists® to carry a heavier burden and its why I don't respect Agnostics® and don't wish to be associated with them, but I am still an agnostic. How can I make these words different?  You seem to be asserting that labeling yourself as an atheist automatically puts you in a position to combat theists, and labeling yourself strictly ""agnostic"" removes you from participating.  Neither of those things is true.  you should identify with a term which correctly describes your position, if you feel so compelled to describe yourself as such.  &gt;the reality is most unattached agnostics are just cowards. All religions teach that all other religions are wrong. Choosing ""none-of-the-above"" seems like the safest bet.  No, they aren't necessarily mostly cowards.  Some are afraid, some are confused about their own belief structure, and some simply don't understand that the word atheist and agnostic can both be used to describe their current belief structure.  It's a popular misconception that ""agnostic"" means ""I think there *could* be a god,"" and atheist means ""I hold that belief that no gods exist, and it is impossible for them to exist.""  This is a problem of misinformation, and lack on introspection, not cowardice.",®

t5_2qh03,TheMock,1342817010,"My friends and companions are dead. The sight of them lying in a pool of blood of our enemies and their own brings a single tear to my eye. These were my friend. We had grown together. Now I had failed them in their greatest need and I felt like I had betrayed the whole world. As I turned to leave I unconsciously dropped my sword and shield. They made a clanking sound when they hit ground. Thoughts in my head were swirling mess as remember how we used go with Carl to the forest near our birth village to take a sneak peak at girls swimming naked in forest lake. Ah, the wonders of youth. What would I pay to be able to go with Carl and feel that youthful excitement. And Donna. She was my first love. She was from neighboring village. I first met her at a festival in her village. I remember it like yesterday. There was this dancing act where girls from her village danced around  a fire. They were all beautiful, dressed in wonderful garments and they moved their bodies like possessed. I was told it was some fertility rite. I was hypnotized, not by the dancing girls but one girl in the audience looking very sad. She was probably near my age with beautiful blond hair and small nose. My heart twisted as looked that sad girl surrounded by all this joy. I knew I needed to make that girl happy so I used all the money I had saved to use at festival and bought one dragon flower.  The flower in my hand, my heart racing, I approached the girl from behind. As I presented her the flower I said: ""Even with that sorrowful face you are the most beautiful thing I have ever rest my eyes on."" The smile she gave me quaked my knees and shattered my youthful heart. I was hers for all eternity. Later that night I found out that her father had died two days before the festival in a hunting accident.  These and more memories of my companions flooded my head I found some strength to check that the wizard was truly dead. I kicked his face in with the steel toe of my boots. That man was wile criminal who had terrorized these parts of the world for many years. Now he lied dead. But in making him like he was now I had lost much. More than I had hoped. The bounty money was good but the price paid was greater. I took his ring as a proof. Hastily I build a stretcher from a table and lifted the bodies of my friends on it. My friend deserve better than be left to rot in this vile place. I would give them a burial fit for heroes. I have only vague recollections of my journey out from the wizard's lair as only things I could think were the faces of my friends and journeys we took together.

t5_2qh03,Niklas11,1342817457,"Would love to get my hand on ""total war shogun 2"", that game looks neat. Going to move soon, not only does that mean I don't have a lot of money in my pocket, but it also means I'm gonna have to put up with really bad internet for a while after I get there. So would love some offline game that doesn't really requite much internet. :)  Also think Sid Meier's Civilization® IV looks cool, if I happen to win and this game happen to be on sale you can just gift me this instead, will probably be 20£ or something cheaper than shogun lol.   http://steamcommunity.com/id/Niklas_dk/  Also thanks for doing this!

You should be able to run it,  but you'll have to leave it at the settings the game recommends.  No there will be no open beta,  but ArenaNet is good about refunding, you will have to contact them via support if you purchase from their website.     If you purchase somewhere else like Amazon, it's subject to their refund policies.  All refund policies are probably variable once the game launches.

t5_2qh61,Mandaralicious,1342837053,"If by ""pretty bad"" you mean birth defects or termination of existing pregnancy, that's not entirely true.  According to [ec.princeton.edu:](http://ec.princeton.edu/questions/bdfect.html)  &gt;In the case of progestin-only pills (like Plan B One-Step, Next Choice One Dose, Next Choice or Levonorgestrel Tablets), these pills contain the same hormones as many daily birth control pills, which a number of studies have found cause no increased risk of birth defects in children born to women who continued to take them because they didn’t realize they were pregnant. As a result, the United States Food and Drug Administration removed warnings about the possibility that oral contraceptives could harm a fetus several years ago. In addition, even if you don’t realize you are pregnant, you would take emergency contraceptive pills long before the organs would start to develop (a process called “organogenesis”), making it extremely unlikely that emergency contraception would lead to birth defects.  Also: [Plan B® One-Step Q &amp; A](http://www.planbonestep.com/plan-b-prescribers/ec-faq.aspx#5)    And their [product information](http://www.planbonestep.com/pdf/PlanBOneStepFullProductInformation.pdf) - [.pdf] states ""Plan B One-Step is not effective in terminating an existing pregnancy.""

t5_2qjny,rook2pawn,1342862756,"So, the key to friends, is to be able to speak about anything and everything. You asked for practical advice: suppose you walk into class and you sit down. There are people around you. Instead of the standard ""Hey how are you?"" (to which you would just get a ""good/not bad."" response), perhaps you can try talking about something you saw last night / on the way to school / what they're serving today in the cafeteria / the homework, and how that made you feel, what you think of it, your opinion or reaction to it, the greatness / sadness / adoreableness / patheticness / keenness / coolness of it all... I found that being yourself usually means elaborating and discussing your thoughts in full detail, but on topics that are of general interest. I know this sounds worked up, but what Im really saying is that Im asking you to be able to talk alot more, and with everyone. Talk to the nerds as enthusiastically as the unfriended, the same way you would talk to the popular ones, the same way you talk to the teacher, the same way to everyone. You be you. I did this in high school: i treated everyone as equivalently interesting and I noticed that people started looking for my attention??!?!! Soon, I had more friends than I could stand and the next year i actually had a social melt down and rejected everyone and became anti social and couldnt stand anyone (lol). But anyways, Im an adult now and I have to say the most important thing in High School is to understand that socializing means not ""honing in"" on a particular group of people, but talking to everyone and enjoying everyone, and allowing yourself to express yourself fully, eloquently, and to be accepted and confirmed as a unique individual that everyone wants to be friends with.

Also, you should bring him in to Reddit, tell him Derrida asked for him.  I would have to say that what is written/typed has become more for communication than anything else. I don't mean the way a reader communicates with a novel but how a person talks to another person. Writing/typing is now, for the most part, done through SMS/IM/Email/Social Media/Discussion Forums.  Many people (in English speaking nations) have an issue with this being the case, because it has caused language to become colloquial beyond our wildest dreams and, to further exacerbate the situation, the English language has never been 'officially' regulated by any academic institution like other languages have. So we are finding the popular culture bleeding into the language like never before, this being due to the endless networks of communication now available. Which is not to say that pop culture had never bled into language before; the speed at which it is moving is now simply mind boggling. Words like *obvs* (short for obviously), *swag* (mea culpa for mentioning this Reddit), *bootylicious*, and many more I'm not yet privy to.  I once wrote a short story that opened with ""In the future, nouns will become verbs."" This is very much the case, at present day.

Fact: Consumers have told us over the years that they have caught some of the biggest fish ever after protecting their fish hooks and lures with WD-40.  We believe this legend came from folks assuming that the product must contain fish oil since it appears to attract fish.  Sorry Charlie®, it just ain’t so.  WD-40 Company has taken steps to respect and conserve the environment, and encourages its users to do the same.  While WD-40 can be used to help protect fishing equipment from rust and corrosion, WD-40 Company does not recommend using WD-40 to attract fish.",®

However, I just wanted to say that if you buy the broken steel ad on, when you wake up after the purifier accident, Elder Lions explains to you why you were knocked out, which apparently was some shock blast or something that was emitted when the purifier was turned on and therefore not the radiation which is why it wouldn't matter if you went in Fawkes as the blast also knocked out Sarah Lyons (who was outside the purifier) and I wont spoil any more incase you wanna buy it for yourself :D  Anyway, give New Vegas a shot! Bethesda are getting better with their fallout stories in my opinion and therefore Fallout 4 should be fucking orgasmic to play.  GL HF ♥",♥

On our way in from fishing for halibut we noticed a few humpback whales playing in the distance and we stopped part way in to watch. It was quite an experience to see something completely airborne so close to the boat. The lucky thing was I got the photo I submitted. A fellow boat also got a picture of the whale close to mid air and it was also all caught on video. Was an amazing day. (© Matthew Thornton/National Geographic Traveler Photo Contest) #",©

Guess one of my latest Crazy stories, which is more screwed up then crazy... Would be the last time I was suppose to meet a girl for a first date (its been almost a year since then). So it was around 8 at night and The girl and I agreed to meet in front of our workplace at 8:10 and go out to dinner, I don't drive so I walked there and waited until a bit after 10 oclock. She never showed up and my phone had died 5 minutes ago, So I started walking home - disappointed and now distracted.    In about 6 minutes I was halfway home, Just crossed the train tracks and enjoying the night air. Two males had just crossed onto my side of the sidewalk and were approaching me - I didn't pay them any mind because I never had a problem before in my city. As Soon as they were within reach they both attacked me - the one on the right grabbed and broke off my 14carat gold crucifix and dogtags that I kept on a gold necklace that my grandmother had given me before she passed away, Along with lesser items that I gathered from my travels. The one on the left had grabbed just under my neck and had my shirt clutched in hand, I broke his grasp by slamming a fist down and threw a punch at his face that missed when He backed away. He started to run past me, So I threw another punch at the guy on the right which missed when he sprinted away. I ran forward and grabbed a streetpole to swing myself around faster so I could chase after them - it worked for the most part except my boot slipped off the wet edge of the sidewalk and lost my balance. I fell straight to the ground and tried to stop my fall by throwing my left arm out straight to the ground, The fall with my weight ended up breaking my arm's bone right in front of the elbow. Even though it hurt and I couldn't move my arm well now - I still got up and continued chasing the two males that were still within visual range, I ran as fast as I could trying to catch up not knowing what I was going to do with one arm incapacitated, but it didn't matter - I could see a red car pullout of a parking lot and stop right in front of the two males, they got in without hesitation and the vehicle drove off and pass the intersection.     Sorry about the long read guys! Had to get the details in. :) Anyways, good luck everyone.",®

What's for sure is that revolutions haven't worked, they only seem to happen in backward countries where people have nothing left to lose and democracy isn't seen as important, while reformism has also been a dismal failure as it hasn't done enough.

Here's more info on Jim and a news story on the incident.  &gt;Jim Stanek, one of the founders of Paws and Stripes™, was sent home from his third tour in Iraq for injuries he received on deployment.  After nine months in treatment at Brook Army Medical Center in San Antonio, TX, Jim discovered that the most comfort and relief he found was in the presence of therapy dogs.  In May of 2010, Jim and his wife tried to obtain a trainer for their rescue dog, Sarge.  They soon found out how difficult and expensive this process is.  After being either turned down or unable to pay for service dogs from multiple organizations, the two looked at one another and agreed to start their own organization for veterans.  Incorporated in June of 2010, Paws and Stripes™ was born.  Now, he has trained his own service dog, a process that he has found rewarding, relaxing, and more effective than any pill or therapy session.

The short answer is yes. They have and said they will investigate Jim's claims.  &gt;A message from Jim Stanek: To everybody who has posted on Facebook and emailed Paws and Stripes. I what to say thank ya'll so much. The amazing support you have all shown and given is so heart felt. At this point Sarge and I are recovering. Sarge is resting and getting back on her regular food. Our trainers say that it could be 4 to 8 weeks to get her back to working condition. They also did say that because of what happened some new skills would have to be introduced. As for me, I am hanging in there. This situation has taken its toll. But please be assured that I will bounce back. Thanks again for all the support and love. ",™

Parents, curious to know their child's sex, frequently request visualization of the fetal genitalia.  During second-trimester ultrasonographic examinations it is usual to see fetuses explore their body and their environment. They handle their own feet, head, genitalia, umbilical cord, and so on.  We recently observed a female fetus at 32 weeks' gestation touching the vulva with the fingers of the right hand. The caressing movements were centered primarily on the region of the clitoris. Movements stopped after 30 to 40 seconds and started again after a few minutes. Furthermore, these slight touches were repeated and were associated with short, rapid movements of pelvis and legs. After another break, in addition to this behavior, the fetus contracted the muscles of the trunk and limbs, and then clonicotonic movements of the whole body followed. Finally, she relaxed and rested.  We observed this behavior for about 20 minutes. The mother was an active and interested witness, conversing with observers about her child's experience.  Evidence of male fetuses' excitement reflex in utero, such as erection or ″masturbation” movements,1 has been previously reported.  The current observation seems to show not only that the excitement reflex can be evoked in female fetuses at the third trimester of gestation but also that the orgasmic reflex can be elicited during intrauterine life.  This would agree with the physiologic features of female sexuality: The female sexual response is separate from reproductive functions and doesn't need a full sexual maturity to be explicit.2, 3  Copyright © 1996 Published by Mosby, Inc.",©

The word 'LEGO', when used as a noun, should only refer to the company that makes the product. Otherwise 'LEGO' is supposed to be used as an adjective. Thus, when referring to the pieces, neither 'lego' nor 'legos' is correct... rather one should say: 'LEGO bricks' or 'LEGO pieces' or whatever (using LEGO as an adjective -- and one should really capitalize all of the letters, and put the little 'circle-R' symbol after it (®)). This is all a matter of protecting the trademark of 'LEGO' for the company (using it otherwise degenerates the strength of the trademark). This is not to say that I use the word correctly 100% of the time... but that's the answer to the question (it's always fun/painful to read the near-flame-wars that start at slashdot.org over this topic... and generally, both sides are wrong). http://www.ericharshbarger.org/lego/faq.html",®

This translates into ""touch_single_wire ∧ circumstances → dangerous"". I will use b for touch_both_wires, d for dangerous, s for touch_single_wire and c for circumstances from now on.  Now if b is ⊥, d has to be ⊥ for ""b ↔ d"" to hold true. Hence it is not dangerous if you don't touch both wires. We can construct a contradiction between the two propositions ""b ↔ d"" and ""s ∧ c → d"" using the following interpretation: b false, s true, c true. According to the first proposition, d is false as discussed. According to the second proposition, d must be true by implication for the proposition to hold true. Therefore one of the two is wrong and I believe it's yours.  I'm just trying to clarify things a bit here, since this is a common fallacy.  Regards, a logician.",↔

In my mind I felt if I didn't post Minecraft I would have an uphill battle. Rather than do something I was no longer enjoying I was ready to just hang it up. Behind the scenes I decided to retire and take the summer to do other things and see if when I got a new system I wanted to pick up making videos again.  Now as the summer is ending and I have a new system I came to the conclusion I am not done.

t5_2qkib,huntingoctopus,1343016864,"pasted from http://www.susoils.com/camelina/  CAMELINA INFORMATION  Camelina sativa is a member of the mustard family, a distant relative to canola, and an exciting new player on the biofuels scene. Camelina plants are heavily branched, growing from one to three feet tall producing seed pods containing many small, oily seeds. It’s proof that good things really do come in small packages.  Camelina spreads workload and reduces risk. It is a short-seasoned, fast-growing crop that can help spread your workload. In the northern Plains, camelina is planted in early spring and harvested in late July most years.  In some geographies, farmers have seen success with fall, or dormant, seeding of camelina, which allows an even earlier start to the growing season.  Get something instead of nothing. If every drop of moisture is precious, you may want to consider camelina. It can produce seeds with less moisture so you’re assured of something to harvest. Plus, by maturing earlier than most other crop options, it’s not as dependent on rain later in the summer when Mother Nature can be more fickle. And since camelina can be harvested early, it allows ground to absorb later-season rainfall so it can enter the new year in a better position.  Some call it low input. Camelina can be low input – it can survive on little water, and it takes less fertilizer than many other crops. But it still requires management. Learn more by viewing our production protocols.  Sustainable Oils is working with crop protection companies to give growers more herbicide options.  Poast®, a post emergent grass control product, is labeled for the crop. Even with the availability of Poast farmers should apply glyphosate in the fall and perhaps even again before the camelina emerges to ensure the crop gets off to a good start. Camelina competes well against weeds once a crop is established, but it isn’t a miracle crop. Manage it right and it works.  Camelina can be seeded and harvested with conventional farm equipment.  Camelina has high oil and protein content. Camelina typically contains 35-38% oil, which is high in omega-3 fatty acid. This makes the oil fit for biofuels production and the meal a good option for livestock feed.  The emerging green fuel industry is turning camelina into a new crop rotation option and consistent income source for farmers. The seeds are easily crushed with oil being used for biodiesel or aviation biofuel that performs similar to fuels from other sources but can be more efficient.  The remaining meal is a protein-rich feed source for cattle, poultry or swine. Sustainable Oils has led an industry coalition that has secured approvals for feeding in rations for broilers, laying chickens, feedlot beef cattle and swine, and is working to secure camelina meal approvals for all animal uses.  An annual that originated in Northern Europe, camelina has many names: gold-of-pleasure, false flax, wild flax, German sesame. One of our favorites is Siberian oilseed; it’s such a hardy, cold-tolerant plant it seems to deserve that name. But whatever you call it, we think it spells a new profit opportunity for farmers in the US and Canada. Learn more about opportunities for growers.",®

Thus, when referring to the pieces, neither 'lego' nor 'legos' is correct... rather **one should say: 'LEGO bricks' or 'LEGO pieces'** or whatever (using LEGO as an adjective -- and one should really capitalize all of the letters, and put the little 'circle-R' symbol after it (®)).

To the rest of the Muslim world, Persian culture and Arabic culture are so similar that it's splitting hairs, but those people certainly feel differently.     &gt; Then come the problem that alim ulamak discouraged or hated our ancient tradition because it stems to Hindu/Buddha and animisms and they labelled those tradition as kufur, syirik, and the only thing that is allowed is Islamic stuffs,   I don't disagree. EDIT: To add, it's really such a shame that we would rather deny our own past than dealing with it. Some of our traditions, namely wedding and some funeral rites, are taken straight out of our Hindu/Buddhist past. Can we reconcile them with Islam? Maybe, maybe not. If we continue to deny it and erase them from our history, how are we supposed to know?    &gt; What I'm saying is, Arab != Islam but Islam = Arab  I disagree with this. Islam is meant to be a universal religion; for the proponent of such a religion to go around and say Arabic culture is the Only™ culture is hypocritical.

t5_2cneq,the_talking_dead,1343049700,"2 cents that will get buried and downvoted. Who cares what the CEO of Chick-Fil-A thinks about gay marriage? I am extremely pro-LGBT rights, but why is it that, unless your opinion is the same as everyone else on a popular subject for debate, you should be annihilated off the face of the planet?  Isn't the point of a free country the fact that people can disagree, people can attempt to affect political change (like donating to groups to further views you personally find important) and run their business how they see fit?   Chick-fil-a has pretty tasty food, treats their employees well, gives every employee in the country a definite day off to rest, worship, relax and is involved in plenty of socially beneficial programs. I can even respect the fact that after so many rumors the CEO came out, expressed his personal views honestly and left it at that.   It is easy to be honest when you know everyone is going to pat you on the back for it. Not so much when you KNOW there is going to be backlash. Especially when it is a ""popular"" thing to be pro-gay marriage right now.   $1.7mil? Drop in the bucket when it comes to most special interest spending. Less important when find out that not all of that went to groups interested in promoting straight marriage only. You have other groups like The Fellowship of Christian Athletes who do plenty of good in the communities they are active in. (regardless of what you think about religious organizations, reaching out to youth and giving them positive influences is important). Yes, by default, Christian groups are going to frown towards gay marriage, but it doesn't mean all of these groups address it directly.   When a company discriminates against gays in the workplace, now you have a real, legal problem that should be eliminated. (Not that they are about to be flooded with LGBT workers after all this.) But here is a company built from the ground up and choosing to support causes that matter to them. That sounds right to me.   If a company came out promoting heavy atheist causes and donated a couple mil towards it, I feel like the community of Reddit would be falling over themselves to praise such a company ""bold"" enough to ""come out"" with their view, even though that would technically be discriminatory towards the millions of religious folk in this country. Or is it that one group's freedom is worth more than anothers?   In the end, the ability to dissent from popular opinion is what makes this country pretty amazing. We certainly have our faults in 'Merica™ but the ability for most groups to have their opinions heard is important. It seems in the world of special interest spending, lobbying and the like, there are bigger issues to focus on than a few dollars spent on supporting a company owner's religious views. Show me that special interest spending from oil companies, the beef industry, agriculture, pharmaceuticals...etc. I bet all those are a bit more important at the end of the day. Hell, imagine the day we could see everything McDonald's has spent their money on...  **tl;dr - Why does this matter? Expression of personal views is central to our freedoms and $1.7mil to Christian groups (not all of which focus on marriage) is next to nothing. Seems hypocritical when most on this site would praise a company for openly supporting atheist causes. There are bigger fish to fry when it comes to companies' special interest spending.

t5_2tzrt,ExpendableOne,1343073488,"I agree that there's a lot to work around but I'm not entirely convinced that this is an innate problem either.  The higher tendency in women to ""gang"" up, as women, is easily noticeable but I still think it has a lot more to do with male expandability(women viewing men and male opinions as inconsequential and men having to try harder to define themselves as individuals), male sexual shaming(fear of being called a slut for being to friendly with men from women and a fear of being branded/shamed as a homosexual from heterosexual men), male vilification(nothing brings people together like a common fear or hatred) and general feminist influence.   I also don't think that behaviors which are learned in nature, or through peers/family, are simply innate. I think human beings have the innate ability to adapt or mimic their environment but the learned behaviors that persist throughout history persist because they are verbally or culturally passed down from generation to generation.  If you were to take a set of newborns and raise them in an environment when women are culturally vilified and where it's common for men to prioritize other men over women, you would have a similar effect. It certainly doesn't help that women are presented as subjugated either, since then you have fear, unwarranted hysteria and self-preservation affecting matters too.     I think the way women, womanhood, maternity and even femininity tends to be glorified in most cultures also has a huge impact on this too. A lot of women will use, or will want to use, their gender as a way to give themselves, and their arguments, unwarranted additional relevance, worth and authority.  By glorifying their experiences as women, or the experiences of other women for being women, they gain personally and socially.  Another reason why it tends to be so common for women to behave these kind of predispositions too is that very few people, at least until now, have ever really been willing to call women on it the way they have for men. Men who stick up for other men, simply because they are men, would quickly be called misogynistic and chauvinistic, and sexually/socially penalized. Women who do the same thing would instead find their interests tolerated and protected by both men and women.  I do agree that men tend to simply define themselves based on actions and interests first though. Reddit is a good example of this.  It may be a male dominated environment because more men join up but it was never specifically designed to be gender specific. It has always been designed to divide people by interests, despite gender. It is sexist people who go out of their way to see gender when there really is none and who go out of their way to make a problem out of it; and places like twoxc, SRS, girlgamers and ladymra, who specifically go out of their way to focus on the premise of gender, to prioritize female opinions and/or exclude men's, are part of the problem too.  Personally I find the premise of ""male free"" or ""for women™"" spaces to be as inappropriate and offensive as the concept of ""black free"" or ""for caucasians™"" spaces.  Just because a majority of those who share an interests have some small trait that is different, doesn't mean a separate space should be created just for it.   ",™

Go into Settings and check.  3) Extensions can add a search box in a popup, so you click a toolbar button and then type away.  However I invite you to give the shared location bar/search box a try.  It works very well.  Customization of the browser is limited to changing colors and images for the theme, and adding icons with optional HTML popups to the omnibox and toolbar for extensions, or adding context menu items.  It's not as customizable as Firefox but less stuff tends to break when Chrome updates their UI, as a result of this design choice.  4) You can start typing a bookmark url or title in the omnibox (location bar) and it should appear in the suggested items list, another reason why the omnibox is awesome.  The more you access a bookmark like this the more frequently Chrome will learn to suggest it when you start typing it in.  You can also open the bookmark manager with Ctrl+Shift+O for a less ""messy"" view of Bookmarks.  Also you can sort your bookmarks in this way and get them out of the import folder.",™

t5_2qp5l,bearvivant,1343134860,"&gt;""Well, they can change and not be gay with Jehovah's help.""  It was my understanding that the WTS doesn't actually teach this. In the latest articles I've read that talk about homosexuality, they make the concession that it's something deeply engrained that people are born with. It was also my understanding that they would rather queers be celibate than try to force themselves into marriages. They differentiate between homosexual people and homosexual acts.  From ""How Can I Explain the Bible’s View of Homosexuality?"" (g 12/10 pp. 22-24) &gt;If someone says: “Homosexuals can’t change their orientation; they’re born that way.”  &gt;You might reply: “The Bible doesn’t comment on the biology of homosexuals, although it acknowledges that some traits are deeply ingrained. (2 Corinthians 10:4, 5) Even if some are oriented toward the same sex, the Bible tells Christians to shun homosexual acts.”  &gt;✔ Suggestion: Rather than get ensnared in a debate about the cause of homosexual desires, emphasize that the Bible prohibits homosexual conduct. To make a comparison, you could say: “You know, many claim that violent behavior can have a genetic root and that as a result, some people are predisposed to it. (Proverbs 29:22) What if that was true? As you might know, the Bible condemns fits of anger. (Psalm 37:8; Ephesians 4:31) Is that standard unfair just because some may be inclined toward violence?”",✔

Your [ɛ], for instance, might vary in quality, formants, tone, etc. from mine or anyone else's. At what point does [æ] become [ɐ] become [ɑ]? (This is not to say that you couldn't just pick an average and go with that, though.) The point though is that speech, practically speaking, ends up being one of those continuous phenomenon that we apply discreet labels to—like color for example; if you move along the rainbow, at what point does the color stop being blue and start being green? Fuzzy boundaries.  * The much bigger issue, though, as people have alluded to, is that real honest-to-goodness tight transcriptions in IPA are huge pain in the butt. I can transcribe ""How are you?"" as [haʊ ɑɹ ju:] (common) but there is none of the requisite prosody encoded in that IPA (which can change dramatically—and, at least in English, can affect the syntactic functioning of the utterance). [˦haʊ ˦ɑːɹ ↘ju] conveys different nuance than [˨haʊ ˨əɹ ˩˥ju:] (I doubt I'm even transcribing correctly—like I said, pain in the keester for real, tight IPA.) Throw in tonal languages that have tone pitch per syllable, but can also have the relative overall pitch for phrases rising or falling... whew!",↘

But moving on...  &gt; The shot happened when Martin...well what did Martin do? Did he go all George Bush on Zimmerman? Did he have a hunch about the man following him? Did he go all LA riots on Zimmerman? Why wasn't he prepared to say: ""dude, I'm just walking through here; I live here, not every black guy you see is a potential robber"". (I.e., why didn't he cooperate with weapons inspection).  Perhaps because people in Trayvon's position have to put up with this every single day of their lives, and are routinely the victims of harassment on the part of overzealous Defenders Of White America?™  &gt; That this is an ""indulgence"" on your part bespeaks the position of power you are used to taking in regards to this sort of issue, but more broadly in regards to allowing thought to take place in a space like this (space meaning content as well). And it ordinarily would indeed be you who would initiate closure on the conversation, which is the usual procedure from your type.  Any attempt on my part to ""control"" this conversation has been due to my distaste for blatant fallacies, and my lack of interest in seeing completely irrelevant hypotheticals used to justify indefensible behavior.  If I would have declared ""closure,"" it's because I have spent far too much time and letters pretending that your ""black culture is violent"" excuse is anything other than racist, victim-blaming tripe, because I can tell you are oversensitive to anyone who dares to call you out on it.  &gt; No, not nearly as thoughtful nor as nonviolent as you claim. Not simply softly speaking truth to power, I think.  Despite your desperate need to project your own morass of insecurities onto me, I think I am a slightly better judge of what my own actions have been than someone who has never met me and knows nothing whatsoever about me other than that I dislike blatant disregard for logic used to excuse racist vigilantism.  &gt; There are hunches, there are possibilities, there are measures, actions, policies, strategies, deployments, and so forth. The all form a kind of general condition for which it is necessary to find adequate language and fundamental orientation.  This is why there are police handbooks and procedures for proper investigations. And they may not be flawless, but they are still better than Zimmerman's MO.  &gt; Zimmerman would say that if you follow the guidelines, ""those guys always get away"".  And he'd be delusional to say so. Any experienced cop can tell you this. If you follow Zimmerman's logic, you will get a much larger increase in false positives than the increase in actual positives. From the POV of your almighty ""management of possibilities,"" it is a mathematical negative no matter which way you slice it.  &gt; Open question. If there were a lot of Zimmermans, high crime areas might be more effectively watched and policed, leading to more arrests of more illegally armed people, for example. More watchers reporting more would catch more with warrants, disrupt more gang activity, etc. There would be false hits, of course. And that's part of the problem of hunches. The problem here is that even in the best management of possibility, there's going to be false hits. Being wrong about someone. You can't have watching without being wrong.  And there would be *more added false hits than added positive hits*. Judging by your precious ""management of possibilities,"" it is a net negative.  Sorry to break it to you, but the George Zimmermans of the world are wrong, period, and your personal agreement or disagreement makes zero difference.  &gt; It's a flawed conclusion. Which came first, the chicken or the egg? Are people stuck in poverty due to cultural norms that also produce the violence rate? Do prevalent, uncriticized norms within black culture create both the high level of poverty and the violence rate?  First off, if you think that the ""norms"" you criticize are uncriticized within the various facets of black culture, you have no idea what ""black culture"" is actually like. Oh, and if you think those are ""norms"" in the first place, you ALSO have no idea what ""black culture"" is actually like. Try actually learning something before you expound on the sociological reasons behind criminal behavior.  Secondly, it's been shown time and time again that, yes, the institutional discrimination is baseless.

t5_2rfxx,KeyboardHero,1343167192,"To add on to MikeWhelan2's comment, the champion portrait already displays if the summoner's ultimate is up (indicated by the green circle). What I would really like to see however is a cooldown indicator for that icon. As it is too small for a timer, my suggestion is as follows:  * Between 61 and ∞ seconds remaining - grey circle * Between 31 and 60 seconds remaining - red circle * Between 1 and 30 seconds remaining - yellow circle * Zero seconds remaining - green circle  Using this method at a glance you can determine an estimated Ultimate Arrival Time™ for any given teammate. At most your estimation of their ult will be off by 30 seconds, but two quick glances spaced 15 seconds apart will give you an almost precise estimation of when their ult will be available.  In addition to that, you could also add a hover feature for that circle that displays a small window containing the precise time left on the cooldown. Anyways, just my $0.02, [here's my same response in that thread](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?p=27351060#post27351060) if you think it's good enough for a +1 for Riot visibility.",™

t5_2qh1i,Asmith17,1343174619,"Pink Floyd - The Wall  And, I want to tell you why I think so, because I want you to know my own reasons for picking that specific album for that question, and I hope that after you read this, you will feel the kind of passion one can have for a very specific group of songs, and one specific concept.   Lots of albums today, based on the other comments on albums that they recommend, are made up of singles with a general theme, such as The Black Keys and their album El Camino. Sure, the music is part of the new wave of blues revival, which adds to the “character” of the band. That makes them awesome and entertaining, but one can go from one track to the next on the same album – they all stand alone. But the songs in The Wall play a different role for the listener, and in an age where an album was listened to with the same enthusiasm for going to see a movie, the music was often theatrical and what we would deem today in the most menial of ways as “artistic”.  Well, the Wall is without a doubt the most “artistic” album I have ever heard, and here's why  Disc 1: The story starts with the protagonist Pink. Pink grows up without a father, having lost him in WWII. Without a father, Pink grows up tormented by his overprotective mother, who then sends him to school where he is further oppressed by the abusive teachers and the evil headmaster. All of his memories about the abuse build bricks which are placed into his mind growing up, creating a wall which separates him from the outside world. Pink grows up to be a rockstar, gets married, but all the while the bricks continue to build – increasing his loneliness and frustration. When his wife leaves him, the wall is complete, and he is all alone in his head, surrounded on all sides by his trauma. Reality doesn’t exist anymore, and the world outside fades to black.  ––––INTERMISSION––––  Disc 2: In Pink’s new world, he rules as a rockstar dictator, in which he plays music to the masses in scenes of Nazi rallies and anthem-esque melodies. He executes fans that he deems as unworthy of hearing his art, which only adds to the torment of treating others the way he had been raised. After not being able to take the brutality anymore, he then places himself on trial for the crimes he has committed in his head. All of his past traumas come back and blame him for having feelings that contributed to his isolation. The judge in the trial orders the wall be brought down, at which point the album ends with a repeated melody from the start of the album, “Isn’t this where we came in?”  This entire story, in 26 songs, makes for one of the best examples of what art is for me; it is lens in which we see truths about life. The fact that such an important sentiment about society, made so artistically, having touched so many, and continues till this day as a prime example of what an album can be, THAT is real truth through art.   So, I recommend this album, I hope you enjoy it ☺  TL;DR : The Wall is awesome by virtue of the fact it is awesome",☺

t5_2qhyq,mouseknuckle,1343184282,"You seem to have answered your own question: you have no musical education, but you've found a lot of classical music you enjoy. Even as a kid, there was something about classical music that appealed to me. Maybe I was kind of a weird kid, but there you go. And I have to say you've made some good picks. As a flutist, I have a bit of a thing for Debussy. Saint-Saens ain't bad either. Have you listened to much Schubert? I think you'd enjoy *Der Erlkönig*.  Anyway - I do have to admit I didn't really ""get"" Bach until I started really studying music. Sure, I liked some of his work that I'd heard, but I didn't understand why he was such a Big Deal™. The brilliance of it passed me by until I learned to understand what was actually going on.  Here's the thing: nobody just automatically understands and enjoys any particular type of music. You pick things up by repeated exposure. If I'd been born in India, I'm sure I'd have a much greater understanding of (and get a lot more enjoyment from) Indian music. You may not ""understand"" a lot of classical music right now. Just keep listening, keep trying new things, keep discovering things you enjoy. One day, you'll pick up a piece you didn't understand the first time you heard it, and it will be like a light switch flips in your head, and suddenly you'll ""get it"".   I remember studying for an exam, listening to Anton Webern's *Symphony* op. 21. I knew what was going on in theory, but I wasn't feeling it. I didn't get it, I didn't understand what he was trying to say. The night before the exam I was in a study group with four friends, listening to the assigned music, and suddenly the switch flipped. It was like I was hearing a completely difference piece. I stood up, shocked, and actually said ""holy crap, I get it!"". It was a very weird experience.  tl;dr You don't need a musical education. But the more you learn, the more you'll enjoy. It just keeps getting better. ",™

t5_2tdoc,amphetaminelogic,1343189597,"There *are* people out there that will be supportive partners and still let you be your own person. I can't promise you'll find one, of course, because who can promise that? but I *can* promise that they are out there.   And before I go any further, I think it's worth noting that ""moving too fast"" in a relationship can be a warning sign of bad behavior to come. It's not *always* a warning sign, but it is one often enough that giving it the Official Side-Eye when your partner starts engaging in it is entirely a good idea.  Anyhoodle - I'm in my early 30s, and up until very recently, I had never had what I would call a healthy relationship. Part of the problem was that I had no idea what a healthy relationship might look like and the other part was that I was a sad girl with low self-esteem - consequently, I was a jerkface magnet. Eventually, I ended up in a truly abusive relationship and once I woke up and got out of it, I decided that if I was going to ever have a relationship again, it was going to be a GOOD one.   I knew what to look out for, but even so, the next two relationships after that one were still pretty terrible - I was still getting the hang of things, you dig, and there are always growing pains, especially if you've been in an abusive relationship for a long time at some point before. After all, those relationships tend to make us lose our sense of self, y'know? Before that relationship, you were one person, but after that relationship, you're someone new. What you knew before is not what you know now, and you have to put in a bit of work to figure out who you are now. I think it's very difficult to have a good, healthy relationship without first knowing who you are.   So that's what I worked on for a while - figuring out me &amp; what I wanted out of a relationship - and that's what helped me. Eventually, I found an actual nice guy (not a [Nice Guy™](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH79IeSe0I0), mind you, but a guy that was nice), and though we didn't end up working out, it gave me hope that better relationships are indeed out there.

Your ""Nice Guy™"" is someone who has strong feelings for you, doesn't know what to do with them, and tries to be as kind to you as possible and as close to you as possible.

So naturally the nice guy is going to feel that's unfair.  But attraction is irrational; you do what you have to do.

Well, lets take a look at Photoshop (CS6):  &gt;Intel® Pentium® 4 or AMD Athlon® 64 processor &gt;Microsoft® Windows® XP* with Service Pack 3 or Windows 7 with Service Pack 1 &gt;1GB of RAM &gt;1GB of available hard-disk space for installation; additional free space required during installation (cannot install on removable flash storage devices) &gt;1024x768 display (1280x800 recommended) with 16-bit color and 256MB (512MB recommended) of VRAM &gt;OpenGL 2.0–capable system &gt;DVD-ROM drive  There are two ""Surface"" devices coming out: one with Windows RT and an ARM processor (this will NOT run x86 software) and another with Windows 8 Pro and an Intel Core i (I don't know hardware well enough to compare, but it should work). Windows 8 Pro should be bale to run anything XP, Vista, or 7 can run, so okay there. RAM: no clue - MS hasn't said anything yet. Storage: 64 GB or 128 GB with a microSDXC slot (so, what, another 32 GB?) you should be fine. Screen resolution - just like the RAM, they aren't talking, yet, but it should have a 10.6"" display and 10.1"" displays on a lot of tablets are running around 1280x800, so you will likely be fine). OpenGL - might be sketchy. DVD - HAHAHAHA, no.  The MS Surface is promising, but too far off to have enough information to know what it will be like (and what we know no can change). I think the bigger burden would be on Adobe to offer a version that will work with a certain level of tablet, but I wouldn't hold my breath for a quick (if any) release.  The MS Surface is expected to come out shortly after the release of Windows 8, so that would put it just before Christmas. There are still a lot of blanks for MS to fill in, such as RAM, resolution, and more importantly, cost.  ---  Another option would be a 'tablet PC' - a predecessor to tablets as we know them today, these laptop-like devices offered the benefits of a laptop with the addition of a more articulating screen, which was typically touch sensitive. [Tablet PC's @ Newegg.](http://www.newegg.com/Store/SubCategory.aspx?SubCategory=407&amp;name=Tablet-PCs&amp;Order=RATING) - as you can see from those options, they are laptops with touchscreens - they should have the power to use something like Photoshop, you can dock them with keyboards/mice and external monitors, and should be just as portable as a regular laptop. You may also notice that they cost more, but I don't think the trick screen comes cheap. Something to keep in mind when shopping around is that some new systems sold with Windows 7 may include a free upgrade to Windows 8 (after its release).  As a side note, I don't think anyone has really used Windows 8, so beyond the hype of it being shiny and new, I don't think there is much meat behind it, yet. If you really want Win8, wait a short while after it is released until the opinions/reviews of it come in.",®

Dart can be compiled to ES5+.  Lexical scoping is a pretty big plus from my point of view.  Optional types are also neat. If you use types on the ""API boundary"" (i.e. for parameters and return values), you won't have to annotate/document it. This isn't just handy for documentation, it's also great for tools. An IDE can now accurately tell what you're trying to do and provide smart context-sensitive auto-complete and call-tips. Plus, it can notify you if you're doing something silly like passing a string where a number was expected.  Dead code removal is also very handy. You can use gigantic kitchen-sink swiss army knife libraries and in terms of size you'll only pay for the parts you actually use.  Having a build-in construct for classes and inheritance also means that you can use stuff from various different libraries. They all work the same way. There is also package and dependency management. Again, having a standard implementation for this means that stuff *just works*™ across different code bases.

Where it is used as a noun, the document makes it clear what definition it is using:  ""California law does not define collectives, but the dictionary  defines them as “a business, farm, etc., jointly owned and operated by the members of a group.”  (Random House Unabridged Dictionary; Random House, Inc. © 2006.)  Applying this definition, a collective should be an organization that merely facilitates the collaborative efforts of patient and caregiver members – including the allocation of costs and revenues.  As such, a collective is not a statutory entity, but as a practical matter it might have to organize as some form of business to carry out its activities.  The collective should not purchase marijuana from, or sell to, non-members; instead, it should only provide a means for facilitating or coordinating transactions between members.""  ag.ca.gov/cms_attachments/press/pdfs/n1601_medicalmarijuanaguidelines.pdf  Well, at least one of us is actually reading.

(8oz. each) cream cheese, at room temperature  6 eggs  1 can (14 oz.) GOYA® Sweetened and Condensed Milk  1 can (12 oz.) GOYA® Evaporated Milk  Directions 1.	Heat oven to 350°F. In small saucepan over medium high heat, add sugar and ½ cup water. Bring water to boil, stirring constantly until sugar dissolves. Continue to cook sugar mixture, without stirring, until deep golden brown and caramelized, about 15 minutes. Carefully pour caramel to 8-cup heat-proof mold, quickly swirling to evenly coat bottom before caramel hardens; set aside.  2.	In medium mixing bowl, using hand blender or whisk, beat together cream cheese and eggs until smooth. Whisk in condensed milk and evaporated milk until smooth and combined. Pour cream cheese mixture into prepared mold with caramel. Place mold in larger, deep pan. Pour enough hot (not boiling) water into larger pan, until water comes halfway up sides of flan mold to form bain-marie. Cover tightly with foil.  3.	Transfer pan to oven. Bake until flan is set (thin knife inserted into center will come out clean), 40-45 minutes. Remove flan mold from pan; discard foil. Let sit until cool. Transfer flan mold to refrigerator until chilled, at least 2 hours. To unmold, run think knife around edges of flan. Invert onto serving plate. Cut into 12 pieces. ",®

You should register your PUFFiT™ vaporizer when you purchase it to ensure expedient Warranty claims. Visit www.discreetvape.com/warranty/ to get full details.  Two really important things there in my opinion that possibly distinguish the MFLB over this. While the MFLB uses rechargeable batteries that can be a pain compared to something built and and USB charged, the fact that you cannot replace the battery in this is somewhat problematic. Second, the MFLB has a LIFETIME warranty. A 1 year warranty on a (likely) limited life built in battery is weak by comparison, in my opinion.",™

t5_2qp5l,bearvivant,1343305863,"From the article ""Young People Ask How Can I Explain the Bible’s View of Homosexuality?"" (g 12/10 pp. 22-24)  &gt;If someone asks: “Doesn’t your view of homosexuality encourage prejudice against gays?”  &gt;You might reply: “Not at all. I reject homosexual conduct, not people.”  &gt;✔ You could add: “To illustrate it, I also choose not to smoke. In fact, I find the very idea of it repugnant. But suppose you’re a smoker and you feel differently. I wouldn’t be prejudiced against you for your view, just as I’m sure you wouldn’t be prejudiced against me for my view—am I right? The same principle applies to our differing views of homosexuality.”  and  &gt;If someone says: “Homosexuals can’t change their orientation; they’re born that way.”  &gt;You might reply: “The Bible doesn’t comment on the biology of homosexuals, although it acknowledges that some traits are deeply ingrained. (2 Corinthians 10:4, 5) Even if some are oriented toward the same sex, the Bible tells Christians to shun homosexual acts.”  &gt;✔ Suggestion: Rather than get ensnared in a debate about the cause of homosexual desires, emphasize that the Bible prohibits homosexual conduct. To make a comparison, you could say: “You know, many claim that violent behavior can have a genetic root and that as a result, some people are predisposed to it. (Proverbs 29:22) What if that was true? As you might know, the Bible condemns fits of anger. (Psalm 37:8; Ephesians 4:31) Is that standard unfair just because some may be inclined toward violence?”  So basically, the JWs don't have an explanation as to *why* people are queer, but they do concede that people with same-sex inclinations/orientations exist. This is fine, since we all, according to them, have evil/bad inclinations. They draw the line at *acting* on those desires, however. As far as I know, they've stepped away from being able to cure queerness via opposite-sex marriage. **The ideal queer JW would be celibate**- knowing that their orientation is a result of sinful degeneration.  Eventually, they would be straight in the New System of Things, since that sinful condition will go away.  **As for college**, it seems like there's a difference between what the WTS teaches and what the culture is like in a particular congregation. My father was Presiding Overseer and I was able to go off to college after a lot of bitching. Some people on this subreddit never had a chance, while some never faced any pressure not to. The WTS sees college as a waste of time and dangerous since it takes time away from ""spiritual"" activities and it exposes JWs to, you know, knowledge.",✔

t5_2qh1i,TheUnderstanding,1343309776,"First and foremost, the vast majority of Americans are stupid, don't forget that. Look at what Americans ingest in terms of entertainment, cultural influence, news and of course, food. The stereotype of the fat, dumb American is very much correct. I once heard someone say that Americans are over opinionated and under educated, that is spot on.   Realistically, American's don't know what freedom is because A. they are too lazy to care B. they don't want to take the time to find out. By in large, we define our freedom by looking out into the world at other countries and comparing ourselves to them.  E.g. we have more freedom than China, Iran, Somalia. However, such comparisons are misplaced, unneeded, and highlight the depth of American ignorance. The truth is, American freedom stems from our Constitution, not a jingoistic expression that we are freer than other nations.   See, freedom is only as good as it's keepers. And here in America, people don't really care about their freedom, they care about causes. Half of America cares way too much about gay people, and keeping them from getting married. The other half cares way too much about ensuring they do get their right to marriage.   And in the meantime much more pressing issues slip by wilth little notice because America is too busy fighting for gay rights and abortion. Reddit is a perfect example of this, reddit spends all day talking about both (gay rights and abortion), but none of them know or care that their freedom is being stripped from them in ways they don't understand. In fact, American ignorance is very telling on issues of freedom, not by what they talk about, but by what they DON'T talk about.    Popular causes garner the vast majority of attention, meanwhile major offences to the Constitution slip by in bills and acts because most people are one cause activists. The feminists only give a shit about rape and abortion, you won't hear them talking about the Lavon Affair and how Israel really isn't our friend. The Christian Right only give a shit about stopping gay marriage, you won't hear them raging against Federal Reserve Notes and how they are taking away our economic freedom.   As I said before, Americans are dumb (myself included). I mean, look at the top comment in this post ""You're confused. In America, we are Free™"" 748 points. Really? This is it? This is the most popular answer to your question. As much as it saddens me, that's pretty much in line step with what one should expect.   What I'm trying to say in a long winded way is that Americans refer to their country as free, because it is more of a perception in their own mind than reality. We want to believe we are free, but are too ignorant to really care or find out what freedom really means. It's a lot easier to point at other counties and talk about how much freer we are than them, than it is to read the Constitution and find out what our founding fathers had in mind for us.   Americans don't want to read the Constitution or Common Sense. We'd rather grab a beer get drunk, and scream about how great we are with little regard to what makes us great. It's easier and certainly more fun.  ",™

t5_2qh5b,gnomicarchitecture,1343353942,"&gt;X is a variable that I'm using as part of the definition of ""A ought to do X"", so you could replace X with ""murder"", ""not-murder"", etc. in the same way you could replace A with ""Alice"", ""Bob"", etc. There's no existential quantification over X like there is over p. Now, you were making a universal quantification over X in saying ""For any action X..."", which implies that I could replace X in ""there exists a P which is such that it is true, it cannot be made true or false by A, and A believing P will imply that A does X"" with anything I like (such as murder or not-murder) and produce a true statement.  I think we should formalize this to understand what's going on. The way I understood your def. was:  ∀a∀x {Obligated(a,x)↔[Ep (True(p) &amp; Independent(p,a) &amp; (Believes(a,p)→Does(a,x)))]}.   (All brackets are parentheses).   Where the domain of a is people, the domain of x is actions, the domain of p is propositions, Independent(x,y)=x's truth is independent of y, and the other predicates being clear. Which I read in Natural Language as:  For every a and for every x, a is obligated to x if and only if there exists a p such that p is true and p's truth is independent of a and a believing p implies that a does x.   If this is not what you mean, then a lot of what I'm saying probably doesn't apply.   &gt;t's typical to say that a combination of beliefs and preferences can imply an action (e.g., ""Evolution is a true scientific theory + I like learning about true scientific theories → I will study evollution""), but it would have to be a peculiar sort of belief that categorically implies an action all on its own, without regard to someone's preferences. (I think this is the main point of Hume's theory of motivation and the whole is/ought business.) So, ordinary beliefs about the world (""evolution happens"") can affect actions, but not in the necessary (or at least, unavoidable by change of preference or action) way which ""obligation"" demands.  This is assuredly true in a sense, that is, we don't normally talk as if beliefs by themselves entail actions, but that's probably because of the fact that you *can't have any beliefs* without any desires, similarly, you can't have any desires without beliefs, any motivations without desires, any desires without motivations, etc. In other words, *holism* is something we run into a lot, and so when we develop theories of belief, we often have a rich set of desire-belief pairs that we can match up with actions. However, there are desire-belief pairs which need to imply certain actions, in order that we have any psychological theories. Similarly, for every belief, a certain desire is required if that belief exists, and the other way around as well (you can't desire to eat snakes if you don't believe in snakes, you can't believe in snakes without desiring to go outside, etc).   Holism might be false, but I don't think that would help here, because that would just mean beliefs can be independent of desires or motivations. You would still need certain actions to be implied by beliefs, or else you are not going to be able to have any theorizing or generalizing about belief. I can't know what ""believing in the existence of the titanic"" is if there's no actions that it will imply. As a naturalist anyway.   &gt;For the &lt;{E,X}, G&gt; thing, we could define ""dependence on X"" in a purely extensional way by saying ""it must be possible to change its truth-value at least some of the time by changing the value of X"". However, I'm not sure if the incorporation of an analysis of p itself within the scope of quantification solves any problems which aren't solvable by other means.  Right, so, as you note below, you want a theory that will get you if a believes  ""a ought to do x"" then that implies that a does x. The way I suggested doing this is trying to include something about x in P. As of now, that's not happening. In other words, as of now, P can be absolutely anything, such as a belief in the existence of pineapples. We want P to be something like ""A ought to do X"". You said you didn't want something that direct at the risk of incoherence objections from non-cognitivists, so we'd have to skirt by it somehow. That's what the &lt;{E,X}, G&gt; is for. Your new suggestion seems to be:  P can be rendered false by switching X with another X.   Which helps, but I'm not sure how much. P might still be a belief in the existence of pineapples, where X is something like ""imagining eating a pineapple"". P might, likewise, be rendered false is you change X to ""attacking someone"", since pineapple belief doesn't imply you'll attack people but plausibly does imply you'll imagine eating pineapples.   &gt;Could you elaborate on that? I'm not sure what you mean by ""having a necessity operator where X is"" or ""in both places"".  I mean that if you say ""necessarily, A believes P implies A does X *and* X=something that has to do with P"" then that seems alright, but if you do this: ""necessarily, A believes P implies A does X *and* necessarily X=something that has to do with P"" seems to be asking for too much. I feel like the necessity operator is just more useful next to the new thing at the end, rather then before the conditional, because necessitating the conditional seems to be what is making it look like a law of psychology (specifically, the law that any belief implies an action), as opposed to a specific, important fact about normative beliefs.

You can also get the [Kelty Cosmic Down 0º](http://www.kelty.com/p-410-cosmic-down-0.aspx) or [20º](http://www.kelty.com/p-457-cosmic-down-20.aspx) for $190 or $130, respectively, which are pretty good bags for the money but not exactly top shelf quality down so compressibility is going to suffer a bit.   Since the [Cosmic Down 20º](http://www.kelty.com/p-457-cosmic-down-20.aspx) is 2lb 10oz that puts it in direct competition with the Cat's Meow, but note the Cat's Meow comes with a compression sack and the Cosmic Down only comes with a (larger) stuff sack. The Kelty Cosmic Down 0º at 3lbs 11oz is hard to beat if you want to get some winter camping, though.  Finally, I have no experience with any GoLite gear but they seem to have quite the following. [Their bags are very reasonably priced](http://www.golite.com/sleeping-bags/3-season).  Down doesn't insulate very well when wet but synthetic doesn't last as long due to repeated compression: typically I'd expect a synthetic bag to last 2/3 the lifetime of a down bag, which is about 10 years. Finally, down tends to feel warm nearly instantly, whereas synthetic takes a few minutes to really warm up.  Personally I think a 20º bag is a great place to start. I have a synthetic 25º bag that I use in the shoulder and wet season ([REI Lumen 25](http://www.rei.com/product/794797/rei-lumen-25-sleeping-bag), $150, 2lb 10oz) and I have a 0º bag ([MHW Phantom 0](http://www.mountainhardwear.com/Phantom™-0-%28Regular%29/OU8438_R,default,pd.html), $500, 2lb 10oz) for cold weather and a beat up old 30º (more like 40º) down bag for warm weather to lighten up the load (2lb).

Et on commence seulement aujourd'hui à abattre le totem de la colonisation. (Oh, jeu de mot.)   Il en reste beaucoup à faire.

Et je sens votre impatience, quand vous me dîtes ""English!"" Vous me rappelez le nom de ce qui est maître, ici. Au cas où je l'aurais oublié.

t5_mouw,HINKLO,1343405134,"I'll preface this with IANAD, but it would probably depend on the situation. Marrow matching is difficult in the family because you will only share about half (give or take) of your HLA markers with each of your parents. In most cases your parents will be a poor match, and each sibling has a ~25% chance of being a match.  &gt;You inherit half of your HLA markers from your mother and half from your father, so each brother and sister who has the same parents as you has a 25% chance of matching you. It is unlikely that extended family members will match you. However, your parents and/or children may also be tested to confirm your HLA typing and to make sure no possible donors are overlooked.  &gt;About 70% of patients who need a transplant do not have a suitable donor in their family. If you do not have a donor in your family, your doctor can look for an unrelated donor or cord blood unit for you. Your doctor can work with the National Marrow Donor Program® (NMDP) to search our Be The Match Registry® and other registries around the world — nearly 18.5 million potential donors and more than 590,000 cord blood units.   If there was a match, then they would probably search the registry for an unrelated donor without that predisposition first. If you were the only match at the point, they would probably weigh the risk of disposition to autoimmunity (which is a general risk for BMT to begin with) with the risk of not having a BMT done. Basically it would *probably* depend on how good of a match you are and how severe a condition your family member had.  If you are really curious about this, I would ask your doctor for more information. Do not take what I'm posting as medical advice.",®

The paper gives great insight into the persistence of different pesticides under different conditions regarding ""simulated rain"", some of the pesticides tested are used in fruit and vegetable crops (eg [Cypermethrin](http://extoxnet.orst.edu/pips/cypermet.htm)).  For some real studies, I looked to two other papers:  [""Reduction of Pesticide Residues of Fruit Using Water Only or Plus Fit™ Fruit and Vegetable Wash""](http://www.springerlink.com/content/gcf4rxrydtxeuj56/) : ""Captan residues were reduced up to 81% when fruit was rinsed with water. Methoml was only reduced 18%.""

Finally, when fruits were washed with a commercial detergent, greater amounts were removed (about 45% of azoxystrobin and pyrimethanil and 60% of fenhexamid).  TL:DR: For some pesticides, water can reduce pesticides on your fruit a lot. For other, not so much. It depends on what you wash with and what kind of pesticide is on the plant.",™

t5_2sgq6,sVybDy,1343444017,"&gt;Also, Paper Mario is a rhythm RPG so that might be why you like it.  That has a lot to do with it, yeah. The ability to start battles with a well-timed first strike and the timed hits and dodges really helps keep me engaged all through the game.  &gt;Can you name any more specifics that you think give you these things you want?  Oh, sure. I was just trying to keep my post short, if you can believe that. But since you asked:  Interactivity — Downtime is the enemy here, so that means fast, twitchy arcadey games are the ones that offer this quality in spades.  Stuff like NFL Blitz (esp. 1998–2001) WWE All-Stars, WarioWare and pretty much your pick of bullet hell/shoot 'em ups fit in this category — though many of shoot 'em ups are overly repetitive, so few stand out. I'm currently playing Beat Hazard Ultra which is a lot of fun, and has a system of unlockable perks that gives me a goal to shoot for (no pun intended.)  Of course, that probably means the game will go stale once I'm finished with that part.  Lack of repetitiveness — Games that constantly introduce new concepts and ideas right up until the very end.  Mischief Makers on N64 is a good example of this; it seems like something new is always getting thrown at you.  One particularly outside-the-box level has you solving math problems to advance.  Kirby Super Star is a good example too, with nine smaller Kirby games all put together, each with their own feel.  And I suppose I ought to mention WarioWare again.  And game series that are continually innovating by adding new mechanics instead of relying on the same old, same old score points here as well.  The Super Mario series gets points here for rarely resting on its laurels, although a few of them almost seem cut &amp; pasted from other games in the series.  I'm really glad, for example, that we got Super Mario Sunshine instead of Super Mario 64 2.  Although who knows, maybe it would have been good; Super Mario Galaxy 2 had plenty of new stuff and didn't feel at all like a rehash.  Unreality — Well, I already mentioned Portal. I could also cite the Burnout racing games, as well as Crazy Taxi.  And Katamari Damacy (though the series is beginning to suffer from repetitiveness, but the original and the its sequel, We ♥ Katamari, were great.)  Also Spider-Man 2 (GameCube/Xbox/PS2.)  Any superhero game would sort of fit the bill here, but Spider-Man 2 was the one that *nailed it.* It scores high in the interactivity area due to the very direct and precise control you have over web-swinging, something every other Spider-Man title since seems to have decided was a stupid idea.  Motion Control — Kinect is truly an amazing device as far as I'm concerned.  Kinect Adventures is a ton of fun and a great starter game, and I found Hole in the Wall to be a really neat experience that couldn't be done any other way (I even bought the Deluxe Edition at four times the price of the downloadable version!) I'm also looking forward to Wreckateer, which was released this week but I haven't gotten around to buying yet (probably this weekend.)  But my favorite Kinect game is Rhythm Party. It's sort of a spiritual sequel to Dance Dance Revolution, where you use your arms and legs to hit targets that pop up around your body.  DDR itself deserves a mention, but it unfortunately fell victim to repetitiveness, and once they turned away from the jumpy J-Pop songs in favor of a more Americanized soundtrack, dropping the BPM and difficulty, it lost points in the interactivity category with me.  I haven't bought a DDR game for any modern system.  And I certainly can't forget the Wii — IMO the best motion control games for that are (in no particular order) Skyward Sword, Excitebots: Trick Racing, Elebits and Wii Sports Resort.  Randomness — Currently playing Spleunky on Xbox 360, even though I also played and beat the PC original. Fortunately the new one throws in a whole lot of new stuff.  If you don't know, what's great about Spelunky is that the levels are randomly generated every time you play, so every experience is truly unique.  Again I need to mention WarioWare (it's not my favorite game of all time but it does happen to hit a lot of my prioritized categories.)  Puzzles — Big list here. Tetris Attack for SNES is one of my all-time faves, though it could just as easily be Pokemon Puzzle League or the drab, uninspired, license-less Puzzle League for DS.  But Tetris Attack came first (in the US anyways) and none of its spiritual sequels have changed up the formula in enough ways to stand out from the original.  I also love Tetrisphere and The New Tetris on N64.  The New Tetris on N64 really changed the strategy of Tetris with the addition of multisquares and monosquares, which were formed by creating perfect 4 x 4 cubes out of 4 tetrominoes, which then yielded bonus lines once they were cleared away.  Compared to that, regular Tetris is boring now.  I also like a bunch of Popcap's stuff in the modern era, Bejeweled 3 and Peggle being recent favorites, and to be completely different, I also enjoy the Professor Layton series, as well as Telltale's Puzzle Agent.  Oh, and Infinite Interactive's Puzzle Quest series too.  And I was hyper-addicted to Dr. Mario Online RX again just a couple of months ago.  But I guess I've been cured of that bug (pun intended.)  Story — Again I'll mention the Metal Gear Solid series.  It had such a gripping narrative, that I couldn't help but need to know how all the twists and turns would work out.  They don't all have to be like that, though (which is fortunate since few games have this.)  Even woefully simple stories, like those offered in the Mario series of games, can keep me interested until the end.  But I really love it when they flesh it out, like in Super Paper Mario.  Colors — Many Nintendo games stand out here, with Mario &amp; Kirby at the top. I also should mention Tomba! for the PS1, which is lesser-known but a really fun free-roaming platformer with light action and mission-based goals with a few EXP-based character upgrades.  Tons of fun and one of my all-time favorites.  Humor — Some additional games I should mention here are Earthworm Jim 1 &amp; 2 (everything else afterwards kind of sucked), Zombies Ate My Neighbors, Portal 1 &amp; 2, and the Raving Rabbids series (although lately the series has been terribly plagued by thin premises and lousy controls, making them a real chore to play.  I think there's a new one coming out for Wii U and I'm not excited for it at all.  I'll need to hear great things about it before considering a purchase.)  Games don't necessarily need to be designed to be consistently humorous, either; as long as they have some good moments that can help make it worthwhile.  Like in Banjo-Kazooie, when approaching Gruntilda's chamber, the game starts playing ominous music, which suddenly gives way to calliope music as you teleport to Gruntilda's idea of a game show. That's an example of a hilarious swerve, not that the game utterly relied on it but it certainly made the game much more memorable.  Though humor is somewhat of a staple of the series anyhow.  &gt;Another RPG you might enjoy is Radiant Historia.  Thanks for the recommendation. I might it check it out someday, far into the future after I've cleared out my backlog of Steam games. Wish me luck!",♥

t5_2qh5b,gnomicarchitecture,1343458690,"&gt;The symbolic logic you wrote matches what I would've said, but I still can't help but think I must be misunderstanding you or vice-versa. A and X are assumed to be specifically defined, at least within the scope of the definition; they're just placeholders to enable us to talk about the general schema of statements. We could restrict our analysis to ""Alice ought to drink water."" Inside the definition, A and X are fixed, and all we can ask is ""Is there a P such that... and Alice believes p → Alice drinks water""; we can't fiddle around with ""Alice"" or ""drinks water"" in there. Again, am I misunderstanding what you're saying? (This also relates to the paragraph of yours beginning ""Recall that X is still a variable"").  Right, so the original point I was raising here is that there isn't a P which is such that it is connected to any action X, of necessity. We can show this by looking at the definition:  ∀a∀x {Obligated(a,x)↔[Ep (True(p) &amp; Independent(p,a) &amp; (Believes(a,p)→Does(a,x)))]}.  let's use substitution here to make the right bijunct true:  True(P) &amp; Independent(P,A) &amp; (Believes(A,P)→Does(A,X))  the capitalized arguments are now names, and hence they are bound to predicates of specific objects. We see that belief in P by A is only contingently connected to A's doing X, since it's not the case in every possible world that A does X, or that A believes P. Nor is it even the case that in every world where A believes P, A does X (although we discussed the possibility of this previously, and if modified, that is suggested by the definition).   So let's say X is going to evolution school. Believing P implies that I go to evolution school, but it might also imply I go to business school, or literally anything else.   &gt;I still maintain that a combination of ""is"" beliefs won't in general cause an action; only a combination of ""is"" beliefs and desires will. (The reasoning behind this would seem to be the same as behind the is-ought gap; roughly put, take the argument on page 81 of Michael Huemer's Ethical Intuitionism and replace ""evaluative"" with ""action-implying"" and ""value system"" with ""behavior"").  I see, in that case, if you can avoid holism (e.g. let's say you could show holism was false), *then* you would be able to refute the anti-holist's objection. Although this would not constitute a demonstration that in the actual world, sole beliefs in general don't cause actions, it would only be a demonstration that in worlds in which beliefs appear alone (which is possible on anti-holism), they don't imply anything. In the real world, beliefs certainly don't appear to do this, and hence, they might imply the existence of a certain desire, which would in turn imply that you do a certain action.   Edit: I also don't see how karmo's proof works into this. Would the indexes v1 and v2 be specific behaviors? Or behavior systems? would C be an action implying proposition or simply the proposition that a descriptive premise P is action implying? I was thinking maybe you were getting at the idea that evaluative should mean behavior, so it refers to a specific action, such as ""john mows the lawn"", and value system should be ""desire system"", or (to demonstrate you point about belief-desire pairs) ""motivation system"" such that a desire system v entails a specific behavior, such as C. E.g. C is made true by certain desire systems. This way, you get the result that every argument with an action as a conclusion has got an action premise somewhere. However, you don't get the conclusion that the action premise is entailed only by a given desire system. Am I interpreting this right? The Karmo machinery may be obfuscating some of this.   &gt;The big question, though, is: how it it possible for anyone (such as Alvin Plantinga) to believe this? Isn't this a classic instance of Moore's Paradox?  That's a sort of higher order moore's paradox. That is, you're asking, I think ""how can the belief that there are certain beliefs which are true but not believable be a belief?"" One way of piecing out how is existential quantifiers. There may exist a belief I have which is mistaken, I just don't know which one it is. I might nevertheless believe that there is one rationally. I don't recall a specific paper which discusses being unspecific about mistakeness right now, but, as far as I know, I haven't heard many problems with the relevant belief. Do you have a particular reason you can't believe something like that?   &gt;I don't think a naturalist needs to say that belief must affect behavior. We can accept that a belief is a naturalistic phenomenon (e.g. a certain configuration of neurons firing), and that it might be possible to observe these neurons/whatever, without supposing that it must affect the behavior of the person.  Sure, if you can naturalize beliefs in some way that does not involve external behavior (you are still going to talk about the behavior of your brain, in any case). In any case, most naturalists seem to think that even if you got such a naturalization, it would implicitly rely on external behavior (""the neuron set A is the belief it is because it prompts the agent to behave this way and that way"").

I've never seen a rape victim treated with less than stoic understanding and sometimes they even receive sympathy so strong it borders on dangerous. I'm sure threats have come from the accused in some cases though.   What we really need to change is our culture's affinity for baseless dogma - like believing female rape accusers are hindered by the system in seeking justice. In fact, I believe we're lucky the entire process hasn't been destroyed by people like Jessica Valenti calling for the burden of proof to be on the accused. It's her right to say that shit, but how can we honestly believe our culture impedes justice (or misjustice™, as the case may be) for alleged rape victims when it entertains something that illogical and fallacious?

t5_2rtff,ceol_,1343536600,"On this website, one vote does nothing. Tactical voting by a single user, in this case the other participant, is equivalent to throwing a pebble in a gun fight. What I've found has more of an effect is your comment.  In the ten seconds I've thought of this (admittedly after taking a pain killer), the best way for me to describe it is that redditors truly are hipsters. They revel in being contrarian. They think it's cool to be edgy. I think evidence of this is in the prevalence of all those threads in /r/AskReddit asking for ""your most terrible joke"", ""your most unpopular opinion"", etc. It's also proven by how often a simple comment by another user bashing downvoters will swing the vote totals.  However, this goes both ways. If the trend of a thread is to be extremely racist, come back six hours later and the top comment will be ""holy shit guys why are you all racist?"" Go into the comments of a submission of some guy saying he met another redditor, and the top comment will probably be sarcastically saying how reddit is such a secret club. In both of these cases, the original idea is ""underground""; you aren't supposed to be racist, and people generally think of being a redditor as uncommon. But then someone comes along and is hipster to the hipster, and everyone goes, ""Oh yeah now I think it's stupid!"" The flow of voting is determined by the Last Contrarian Comment™.  So, to bring this back on topic, I think the best way to win upvotes is to constantly play Devil's advocate. If your comment is *edgy* enough, redditors will upvote you solely on their need to think themselves cool by being an outsider.",™

Moriarty the criminal mastermind approaches Sherlock using an act of bumbling seduction and then decides to nickname him ""The Virgin"". The series goes on and on about Sherlock's sexuality as if it was the most important ongoing plot point. Moffat focuses way too much on Sherlock's trousers.

t5_2qhwp,BobisOnlyBob,1343560333,"Gonna tackle these point-by-point. For a nearly 10-year-old list, it's held up remarkably well - not exactly a positive reflection on game development trends.  ---  &gt;I The first cut is the deepest (Skippable cutscenes)  This rule is upheld by a great many games nowadays. Start to pause and resume, back/select or a menu choice (down, confirm) to skip. Skipping a cutscene is a simple one-two motion that can only ever be done with intent.  &gt;II Knock three times (Breakable containers)  The fragility of crates can sometimes be an issue. Can we compromise at two, to prevent stacked crates as used for cover and the like to be a little less fragile? Naturally, forcing the player to repeatedly beat a box before they receive a prize or lack thereof sucks. The physics-enabled crates of modern games do make this a lot more understandable and palatable.  &gt;III Please, make it stop (When is it safe to quit?)  The greatest benefit of quick-saves - the ability to cease and resume at any specific moment - without the biggest drawback, the ability to ""cheese"" difficulty through quick-saving and quick-loading every 5 footsteps. Please, more games need this. Let us save at any time, even mid-gunfight, so we can leave and shut down and later return to the barrage of bullets as we left it, as if we'd done nothing but paused. Basically, any time you can pause, you should be able to *Save &amp; Quit*, and you should be able to *Resume Paused Save* from the titlescreen. The moment you load that ""Paused Save"", the record is deleted, so you can't repeatedly zap back to that same mid-battle point. That's what regular checkpoints and end-of-mission/act saves are for. (This will vary from game to game and genre to genre; I'm not saying every game should have save points or that no game should have quicksaves.)  &gt;IV Cruel and unusual (Long restarts)  Quick restarts are essential. Long game-over sequences, lack of regular and reasonable checkpoints, or sticking entire unskippable cutscenes in *after* the checkpoint (the reason I never got very far with *Red Steel*) are just wrong. I hear *Dark Souls* implements death and checkpointing via its bonfire system amazingly well; some games like *Too Human* fell massively afoul of this.  &gt;V It’s behind you (Camera controls)  LEFT STICK MOVE, RIGHT STICK CAMERA. CLICK THE RIGHT STICK TO RE-CENTER THE CAMERA. It's not that hard, people. On the PC, it should obviously be appropriately mapped to the mouse. Again, this has been better as of late, but it's 2012 and some games STILL suffer from dodgy camera controls. It's like a mental block the industry just can't get past.  &gt;VI The Sound of Silence (Volume and sound options)  I was really enjoying *Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep*. [Then **this** happened.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA3kyqPXPh4) If it doesn't put you into a comatose sleep, you'll rapidly lose your fucking wits... but I don't want to mute the combat and sound-effects. There's no option.  &gt;VII Choke chain training (Tutorials)  Can we just do away with button-by-button introductory tutorials? [A good tutorial is key to a game's critical success.](http://www.penny-arcade.com/patv/episode/tutorials-101) Every game involves teaching the player how to play it, even if it's the 10th installment of a generic shooter. Just make sure it's neither in the way nor entirely skippable. *Portal* and *Portal 2* are the single greatest examples of teaching the player without needing a traditional tutorial. Just listen to the damn commentary nodes!  &gt;VIII Out of your hands (Customizable controls)  [This is all that needs to be said](http://i.imgur.com/c7N3K.jpg). Don't let this happen to your game. Ever. Re-customizable controls are fundamental, not just for convenience, but for accessibility to both dexterity-impaired (sorry, lefties) players and players who have any sort of custom hardware for any reason. Laptops, disability keyboards, ergonomic keyboards - you can't compensate for all these possible designs with one control layout. Give that control to the players.  &gt;IX Previously on Edge’s sofa (Returning to the game after a long break)  Mission journals are always nice; maps with beacons and labels are even better. Giant pointing arrows are sometimes a bit too much, but rarely atrocious. Navi is going too damn far. Mission-sandbox titles - *GTA*, *Assassin's Creed*, *Prototype* and the like all do this pretty damn well.  &gt;X The final proclamation (Issue 10: The Struggle: Long Titles: Lazy punctuation)  While I partially disagree with this because of games like the *Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood*, *Revelations* and all the *Kingdom Hearts* midquels, it should be nipped in the bud before you end up with [Colon Cancer.](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonCancer ""☢CAUTION!!☢ TVTropes Link"") Capcom are the masters violating this particular rule. *Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney: Trials and Tribulations*. *Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike: Fight for the Future*. Even simple sequels end up as *Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening*. There's no need for this!  ---  EDGE's rules are good rules and should continue to be followed. Most of these - particularly the ones the industry still falls down on, like III, IV, VI and VIII - are about [game accessibility](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_accessibility).  &gt;Although Edge stands by its proclamations, it also expects that in another ten years, this list will look laughably obsolete. Hopefully, half of the things on it will have been rendered irrelevant by advances of gaming technology, and the other half will have become so deeply enshrined in game design that no one even thinks of them.  Sadly, the games industry still makes a lot of these mistakes. ""Wait, which sequel is that again?"", ""What was I doing again?"", ""Why can't I remap this??"", ""I HATE THIS SLOW TUTORIAL"", ""Oh god make it stop"", ""Killed by the camera..."", ""Ragequit because of the re-loading time after you die"", ""I can't stop right now!!"", ""Just give me the medkit already"" and ""Why can't I skip this!?"" are all still common refrains, even if more and more games are getting it right.",☢

t5_2t7no,sid9102,1343594924,"I would like to think I look at Apple objectively. I love their contributions to the tech I use daily. I love the way developing for iPhone is so easy compared to the horror of developing for Android. I love the way my 6 year old iMac that I bought off of ebay last year for 200 bucks still just works™. However, I hate how restrictive the appstore is. I hate the way each update to OSX moves it closer to the same closed, appstore based system that iOS has. And I especially hate how they have been using lawsuits instead of improving their cellphones and OS.  I don't think your last paragraph is valid. If a corporation innovates and makes something new, good for them. They should make it to the market first, and reap the profits that they so rightly deserve. But they should strive to move the entire market forward instead of sitting on that one gimmick as the basis for buying their device. Instead of suing competitors, they should compete. The iPhone and iOS is stagnating, and I hardly see how that's Samsung's fault for capitalising on it.  Edit: Oh and on the 'stifling of innovation' front, Apple just won an injunction against Samsung forcing Google to release an update that removes universal search from the Galaxy Nexus. This is only the beginning. If apple continues on this path, it could start removing entire features from competitor's phones.

t5_2qzb6,JasonMacker,1343596567,"I think my biggest concerns are:  1. Wearing hijab is not ""extremist"". The majority of Muslim women wear headscarves.  2. You say you're a ""Quran-alone"" Muslim, which is a very small fringe group that isn't mainstream Islam. The Quran is simply the revelations of God (via Gabriel or directly) to Muhammad. But you can't just read the Quran and instantly figure out everything. It's just a book like any other. It has sayings, allusions to past/current events, figures of speech, analogies, etc. that simply cannot be understood using only the Quran. There is simply no way to just take the ""Quran-alone"" approach. It's a fundamentally flawed position from a historiographical perspective. The Quran doesn't explain how Muhammad lived his life. It doesn't detail how he was born, where he lived, what sort of family he was from, what happened to the early Muslims, etc. There simply weren't any secular (or Christian) historians of the time that were interested in documenting everything Muhammad &amp; the Muslims did. Our only sources are from Muslims themselves. This is a problem that both Muslim historians and secular historians face. And the answer to that is historiography (AKA Isnad or Hadith science) in order to determine the accuracy of various writings. And this is true of the Quran itself. The Quran was originally just orally preached, and it was only after a certain battle where a lot of hafiz died in battle that it was finally decided that the Quran should be written down. Hadith (sayings of Muhammad) and Sunna (traditions of the earliest Muslims) are absolutely critical in interpreting the Quran and Islam. How can you profess any beliefs about Muhammad at all if you reject the evidence of his existence??? The majority of Muslims, over 99%, accept Hadith and Sunna (they only differ on which Hadith and which Sunna). So actually, your rejection, if anything, would make **you** the extremist.  3. You claim that the Quran does not promote violence. I think that's wrong. The Quran does promote violence. But I don't consider the promotion of violence to be a slight. Just about everyone promotes violence in some way. The issue is **whether or not the violence is justified**. I'm not going to be like the other people who misquote the Quran or try to construe its meaning to say that Muslims must be at war with non-Muslims or whatever Islamophobic nonsense they preach. But it's definitely wrong to say that the Quran only teaches peace. It most certainly does not. I'd say Islam is more about ""tit for tat"", in that peace with Islam means Islam is peace with you, while violence against Islam is met with violence against you. This is true of the earliest Muslims and is definitely a sentiment that most Muslims (if not most people) share.  4. I want to expand on point 1 but I'm really sick of that debate. So I'm just going to reiterate that what you're saying is ""Muslim women for 1400 years have gotten it wrong, and it's only in the 21st century that True Islam™ finally makes it clear that Muslim women don't have to cover their head"". Yeah, I don't buy that. I don't like historical revisionism in general. Your reply to Muhammad's marriage with Aisha shows you're not really familiar with Islam at all. How much do you honestly know about Muhammad's life?  5. Finally, I want to ask what you think of the gender essentialism in Islam? This is my biggest problem with Islam. I'm opposed to gender roles and the erasure of GSM (Gender and/or Sexual Minorities, AKA lesbian, gay, transgender, bisexual, intersex, genderqueer, etc.). How do you feel towards the GSM community, especially the GSM who also identify as Muslims? Do you think they're wrong? Do you think it's okay for two Muslim women to get married to each other, or two Muslim men to each other?  **Honestly, #1-4 is just a rehash of what other people have already mentioned, so I'd really appreciate it if you answer #5 with the most detail. If you don't want to address 1-4 you don't have to. But please give priority to answering #5 because that's the one I care about the most. Thanks.**  -Jason  edit: I made the following response to some guy who got downvoted so I thought I'd add it to here so it gets more eyes on it:  &gt;Well, you can look at [this](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f2/Hijab_world2.png) map from Wikipedia which shows the prevalence of hijab.  &gt;Now, whether they're pressured into wearing it by society versus it being legally required versus by choice is a difficult thing to answer.  &gt;However, the doctrinal view of 90% of Muslims (Aka Sunni Islam) is that [""The four major Sunni schools of thought (Hanafi, Shafi'i, Maliki and Hanbali) hold that entire body of the woman, except her face and hands [...] must be covered during prayer and in public settings (see Awrah).""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijab#Women)  &gt;And the other 10% of Shia Muslims aren't exactly known for leaving their head uncovered. So yeah, I'd say that the majority of practicing Muslim women do cover their hair (aka hijab). In western society it's not as prevalent among Muslims but it's definitely prevalent in the Muslim world.  EDIT#2: To everyone that wants to debate what exactly hijab is and what the Quran or Islam **really** proscribes for women, please note that I really and **NOT** interested in that discussion. That's been discussed *Ad nauseam* and that's not my issue with Islam. **My issue with Islam is the fact that men &amp; women are proscribed specific roles**. What's important for me is not discerning what the dress code for women is in Islam. My issue is that there even IS a dress code for women. My issue is that the Quran and Islam don't appear inclusive to GSM. It only ever talks about cisgender men and women. In modern society we have science that shows that **the genders do not work like that**, and that **there's nothing wrong with being an effeminate man or a masculine woman**. But the Quran does not make this distinction. It only makes ONE prescription for ALL people of a certain gender. The Quran states (Sura 4:34):  &gt;Men are in charge of women by [right of] what Allah has given one over the other and what they spend [for maintenance] from their wealth. So righteous women are devoutly obedient, guarding in [the husband's] absence what Allah would have them guard. But those [wives] from whom you fear arrogance - [first] advise them; [then if they persist], forsake them in bed; and [finally], strike them. But if they obey you [once more], seek no means against them. Indeed, Allah is ever Exalted and Grand.  Again, **please do not comment and try to debate whether it's okay to beat your wife, that's not really productive and I think we all already know how that's going to turn out. It's fruitless.** What I'm more concerned about are the first two sentences of that verse. Why are men in charge of women? This is explicitly prescribing gender roles and that's what I take issue with. I think it's flat-out wrong and sexist to say ""men are in charge of women"". It's the 21st century; women can be world leaders, business CEOs (hi Yahoo!), Admirals &amp; Generals (Hi Grace Hopper, love you to death), and so on. Proscribing gender roles like this is so archaic. And again, it becomes a GSM issue because some people don't identify as either man or woman. If two Muslim men want to marry then who is in charge of who? Even straight people don't always identify as the man being in charge of the marriage. I know plenty of straight couples where it's the woman who works and the man who stays at home and takes care of the kids. And I think this is okay, but apparently the Quran disagrees with this. Gender roles are inherently wrong in my view. I believe in gender equality and I don't think your gender (or sex) should give you ""separate but equal"" treatment, any more than the color of your skin, how many working limbs/senses you have, and other trivial things.  Bottom line: **Until Muslims (and religious people in general) reject gender essentialism**, I cannot hold them in high regard. I know it's possible too. There used to be a time where the majority of people believed in racial essentialism, and held a lot of anti-scientific racist views on the ""temperaments"" of races. If religions can overcome ""the curse of Ham"", they need to overcome ""the curse of Eve"" too. Thanks for reading.  ***  Edit ∞:   **To /u/randommuslimgirl** : Hey, my questions have been up for over an hour, but looking at your comment history it seems you've been providing 1-line answers to trivial questions ([""Would you like more pictures?""](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/xcmad/iama_muslim_girl_who_is_not_a_hijabi_i_want_to/c5laocg)) rather than addressing me. Not cool.  **To the others regarding Muslim women:**  A lot of you are telling me that I'm wrong about Muslim women wearing headscarves. I admit I have a narrower interpretation of ""Muslim woman"" than many of you are all suggesting. I'll admit that my statement, as it stands, is not accurate if interpreted using vernacular language.  When I use the phrase ""Muslim women"" I mean women who actively profess and practice Islam. I don't mean ""cultural Muslims"" or ""women who live in Muslim societies"". To give a comparison, 98% of Catholic women in the United States use birth control, when the Pope is clearly opposed to it. If they violate the tenets of their purported religion, are they really Catholic? If they want to profess Catholicism and use birth control (or Christians in general who engage in sex outside of a marriage) that's their prerogative. But I believe that there is an important distinction to be made between ""Christians"" who only go to church on Christmas and Easter, and Christians who go every Sunday, participate in Bible studies, celebrate birthdays at Chick-Fil-A (not really), etc. I'll admit that it gets a little testy when you want to play the ""well who is a real Christian/Muslim"" game. Hence, why I'm not interested in playing that game. What's important is not what the commoners **do**, but what the leaders **preach** and what religious texts **say**. This is why I brought up the following:  [""The four major Sunni schools of thought (Hanafi, Shafi'i, Maliki and Hanbali) hold that entire body of the woman, except her face and hands [...] must be covered during prayer and in public settings (see Awrah).""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijab#Women)  This is a fact. If some individual Muslim woman chooses not to adhere to this, well, okay. I'm not interested in individuals. I'm interested in societies and the views of people in power. I'm going to be brutally honest here: I think the people in power in most of the countries in the middle east are brutal, corrupt, and backwards. By power I mean wealth, positions in government, and positions in society.   **To the others regarding gender essentialism &amp; GSM:**  A lot of the feedback I've gotten is simple declarations of faith. ""Well the Quran says that marriage is between man &amp; woman.""/""Well I believe sodomy is a sin"". Okay, thanks for that. That added nothing to the discussion. If your only justification for your belief is going to be ""because God says so"", that's a conversation stopper, because it immediately shifts the discussion to ""well, justify your belief in God then, and justify that these commandments against sodomy are actually from God and not man-made"". If you want to discuss, from within an Islamic jurisprudence framework (AKA presupposing God &amp; that the Quran is God's words &amp; that Muhammad was a Prophet of God), I'm not interested. That's a discussion between Muslims, no different than how many angels on the head of a pin or how to practice Ramadan at the south pole. What I am interested in, is **what sort of society do you envision as being ideal**? How should Gay Muslims be treated? How should Gay non-Muslims be treated? What is the punishment for apostasy, if any? Should women, regardless of religious belief, be required to conform to your interpretation of Islamic standards of dress? These are the important, interesting questions that I'd like to see answered. **Your relationship with God really isn't important to me. What's important is your relationship with other people.** I'm a secular humanist, so I say that while your prayers are to a god who isn't real, your anti-progressive stances are very much real when they're inflicted on the rest of society. That's the part I care about.  **To the others regarding the term ""extremist"":**  Honestly, I feel like the word has been thrown around so much that it's lost all meaning, much like ""fascist"". It's really just an epithet. I personally don't like using it because it usually boils down to ""Anyone who is less religious than me is not a real Muslim, anyone who is more religious than me is an extremist"". My personal definition of it is two-prong: It is a person who claims to belong to a belief system, but most adherents of the belief system do not agree with that person. In other words, the person has to have a minority view. But I think that in addition to this, there is another requirement for being labeled an ""extremist"": propagating violence, either against other individuals or against sectors of society (ethnic groups, government, etc.). Ultimately, nobody really self-identifies as ""extremist"", so I don't think it's a useful term, especially since there's so many different meanings for it.

You'll notice if you visit the Southern Hemisphere after living in the Northern your whole life, things seem and feel far different than they normally would. This is because the polarity of one's body and the polarity of all matter remains the same as to where it was created. When shampoo reaches the Northern Hemisphere from the Southern, its properties remain the same. However, plastic companies mostly operate out of the Northern Hemisphere. When they are shipped to South America, they still retain their Northern polarity, and so Shampoo, manufactured in the *Southern Hemisphere,* looks perfectly right-side-up when it's bottled.

Well, I think that it's a Good Thing™ to always bring the discussion to those glaringly relevant points when dealing with conspiracy theorists/religious/alternative medicine folk/etc, building the makings of a smarter human society.

They are very concerned with their brand and that it be perceived well, so they monitor their product carefully. When open a box of Rice Crispies®, it isn't possibly partially filled with what Kellogg's intended. It is filled with what Kelloggs intended. Any contaminants are rare and measured in parts per billion. If a box of cereal shipped with significant contaminants or particularly low quality, the company's brand name integrity would be at risk, and they would recall and replace the product. They ship out millions and millions of boxes, all up to a high standard!  They have to control the quality of what their name goes on because they could lose money if people didn't trust them.  God supposedly is much more powerful than Kellogg's. God is an all knowing, all powerful deity.  There is a book that claims to have the direct word and will of god in it. That's his brand name, and he has even more reason than Kellogg's to protect it. If product goes out with the official stamp of ""The word of god"" that isn't intended, then eternal souls may be at stake.  Yet some Christians claim that he has okayed a book that is partially correct, partially inspired by him, partially made up, partially as promised, partially desert fairy tales.  That's some seriously poor quality control and brand management. One would think an omnipotent god would have better quality control than Kellogg's, right?",®

t5_2qh2p,Dudesan,1343664035,"Remember, many Christians find it more comfortable to believe in a god who doesn't condone, command or commit murder, slavery, rape, child abuse, animal abuse, arson, torture, ritual mutilation, fratricide, patricide, matricide, infanticide, genocide, and so on than to believe in one who does.  Unfortunately, since the Bible (Old Testamant and New) is pretty clear about Yahweh's position on these things, holding a belief in Loving Hippie Jesus™ requires ignoring huge portions of it. Or just never reading it in the first place, which seems to be the most popular option.  Well, let's say what Jesus has to say about that:  &gt;“Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished.  (Matthew 5:17-18, NIV)  Some Christians claim that his death and resurrection ""fulfill"" this. That is bullshit for one simple reason: last time I checked, Heaven and Earth haven't passed away.  Jesus also made his views on people ""picking and choosing"" quite clear:  &gt;[Jesus] answered them, “And why do you break God’s commandment because of your tradition? For God said:    *Honor your father and your mother;* and, *The one who speaks evil of father or mother must be put to death.*  &gt; But you say, ‘Whoever tells his father or mother, “Whatever benefit you might have received from me is a gift committed to the temple”—  he does not have to honor his father.’ In this way, you have revoked God’s word because of your tradition. Hypocrites! Isaiah prophesied correctly about you when he said:    &gt;These people honor Me with their lips, but their heart is far from Me.  They worship Me in vain, teaching as doctrines the commands of men.”  (Matthew 15:3-9, NIV)   Looks like Jesus has quite a bit to say about people who ignore commandments, in fact. But maybe it's just Matthew?  &gt;It is easier for heaven and earth to disappear than for the least stroke of a pen to drop out of the Law.  (Luke 16:17, NIV)  Okay, so Jesus is a bust. Let's see what the Epistles have to say about the Mosaic Code:  &gt; If you really keep the royal law found in Scripture, “Love your neighbor as yourself,” you are doing right.  But if you show favoritism, you sin and are convicted by the law as lawbreakers. For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it.   (James 2:8-10, NIV)  &gt;All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness,  (2 Timothy 3:16)  &gt;Do we, then, nullify the law by this faith? Not at all! Rather, we uphold the law.  (Romans 3:31)  &gt;Know this first of all, that *there is no prophecy of scripture that is a matter of personal interpretation*, for no prophecy ever came through human will; but rather human beings moved by the holy Spirit spoke under the influence of God.""  (2 Peter 1:20-21 NAB) ",™

Pictures Announce Third Film in The Hobbit Trilogy   &gt;BURBANK, CA, JULY 30, 2012 — Peter Jackson will make a third film in his upcoming adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien’s enduringly popular masterpiece The Hobbit, it was jointly announced today by Toby Emmerich, President and Chief Operating Officer, New Line Cinema, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, Co-Chairman and Chief Executive Officers, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios, and Jeff Robinov, President, Warner Bros. Pictures Group.   &gt;Jackson, the Academy Award®-winning filmmaker behind the blockbuster “The Lord of the Rings” Trilogy, recently wrapped principal photography on what he originally planned to be a two-film adaptation of The Hobbit, which is set in Middle-earth 60 years before The Lord of the Rings.   &gt;Jackson stated, “Upon recently viewing a cut of the first film, and a chunk of the second, Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens and I were very pleased with the way the story was coming together. We recognized that the richness of the story of The Hobbit, as well as some of the related material in the appendices of The Lord of the Rings, gave rise to a simple question: do we tell more of the tale? And the answer from our perspective as filmmakers and fans was an unreserved ‘yes.’ We know the strength of our cast and of the characters they have brought to life.  We know creatively how compelling and engaging the story can be and—lastly, and most importantly—we know how much of the tale of Bilbo Baggins, the Dwarves of Erebor, the rise of the Necromancer, and the Battle of Dol Guldur would remain untold if we did not fully realize this complex and wonderful adventure. I’m delighted that New Line, MGM and Warner Bros. are equally enthusiastic about bringing fans this expansive tale across three films.”   &gt;Emmerich stated, “We completely support Peter and his vision for bringing this grand adventure to the screen over the course of three films. Peter, Fran and Philippa’s reverence for the material and understanding of these characters ensure an exciting and expanded journey that is bound to please fans around the world.”   &gt;“With the abundance of rich material, we fully endorse the decision to further develop what Peter, Fran and Philippa have already begun. We are confident that, with the great care the filmmakers have taken to faithfully bring this journey to the screen, the film will be welcomed by the legions of fans across the globe,” said Barber and Birnbaum.   &gt;Robinov added, “Peter, Fran and Philippa have lived in this world and understand more than anyone its tremendous breadth and scope, and the relationships that bind it together.  We strongly support their vision to bring this great work fully to life.”    &gt;The first film in the trilogy, “The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey,” will be released December 14, 2012, with the second film releasing on December 13, 2013, and the third film slated for summer 2014. All three films will be released in 3D and 2D in select theatres and IMAX.   &gt;From Academy Award®-winning filmmaker Peter Jackson comes three films based on The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien.

It is a reactionary Stalinist dictatorship that oppresses its own people. There is no soviet-style worker's leadership in china, but a bureaucratic party that is only communist in its name.   Communism is the doctrine of freedom and equality. In Capitalist China workers live in subhuman conditions for 2$ a day so that Americunts can buy cheap tshirts, and the high-ranking members of the stalinist party can drive around in luxurious cars. In Capitalist China freedom of speech and information is suppressed, perhaps even more than in officially capitalist countries. Lenin's bones spin in his mausoleum whenever someone calls China ""communist"".  Counterrevolutionary China has let American imperialism continue to oppress nations time and again. They did not offer Iraq, Afghanistan and Lybia the military and economic assistence they needed. Capitalist China has not helped the oppressed people of Palestine liberate themselves. It has even recognized the pseudostate of Israel. It does not care about spreading communism and leading a world revolution. China has absolutely no problem with American imperialism. Even North Korea is better than China in this case, as it only recognizes Palestine.  In no case am I against you in this context. While both me and the Americunts in this thread disagree with you, they do so from a disgusting capitalist viewpoint, certainly not from one that is in position to make valid criticism of China. You are right in that 1984 is a terrible counter-revolutionary book that only exists to turn people away from communism. That's also the reason it is promoted in Americunt schools, not to ""remind Americunts to latch on to their freedom™"" Fuck Americunts and fuck 1984.  ",™
t5_2r9po,Acromir,1343669685,"Okay, clarified the OP a bit so that it makes more sense. The ""effective recharge"" is how often you can use that skill based on resource regeneration rate. If you're using all 4 skills equally, then ¼ of your initiative goes towards using body shot. The ""effective recharge for that skill is:  [♦ regeneration time] x [4] x [♦ cost of that skill]  For Body Shot, the effective recharge is:  1.67 s/♦  *  4  *  3♦  =  20s.  Another way to think about it: Like I said, we're using ¼ of our initiative for each of the four skills. That means that every time we regenerate 12♦, 3♦ goes to each skill. 3♦ is enough to use Body Shot, so every time we regenerate 12♦, we use Body Shot once. It takes 20s to regenerate 12♦.",♦

TheMoreYouKnow!!!   Research Reveals Why Hungry People Get Cranky  Stress, hunger trigger fluctuating levels of the hormone serotonin in the brain, scans show  September 16, 2011 RSS Feed  Print  FRIDAY, Sept. 16 (HealthDay News) -- When people are hungry, they are more likely to be angry or aggressive. And now researchers have found the reason why: serotonin levels -- a hormone that helps regulate behavior -- fluctuate when people are stressed out or haven't eaten, according to a new study.  Rising and falling serotonin levels affect parts of the brain that allow people to control their anger, researchers from the University of Cambridge explained in the report published in the Sept. 15 issue of the journal Biological Psychiatry.  ""We've known for decades that serotonin plays a key role in aggression, but it's only very recently that we've had the technology to look into the brain and examine just how serotonin helps us regulate our emotional impulses. By combining a long tradition in behavioral research with new technology, we were finally able to uncover a mechanism for how serotonin might influence aggression,"" the study's co-first author, Molly Crockett, who worked on the research as a Ph.D. student at Cambridge's Behavioural and Clinical Neuroscience Institute, said in a university news release.  In conducting the study, the researchers controlled the diet of healthy volunteers to manipulate their serotonin levels. The participants' brains were then scanned using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) as they viewed faces with different expressions -- angry, sad and neutral -- to determine how various parts of their brains reacted and communicated with each other.  The study revealed that low levels of serotonin made communications between certain parts of the brain weaker than normal. The researchers concluded that when this happens it may be harder for the brain to control emotional responses to anger.  The participants also completed a personality questionnaire to assess whether or not they had a natural tendency towards aggression. Those that were predisposed to aggression had even weaker communication between certain regions of their brain when serotonin levels were low, the investigators found.  The findings could be applied to a range of psychiatric disorders in which violence is a common problem, such as intermittent explosive disorder, which is characterized by extreme and uncontrollable outbursts of violence, the authors suggested.  ""We are hopeful that our research will lead to improved diagnostics as well as better treatments for this and other conditions,"" the study's co-first author, Dr. Luca Passamonti, who worked on the research while a visiting scientist at the Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit of the Medical Research Council in Cambridge, England, said in a news release.

t5_2qh1i,Anna_Draconis,1343677582,"It was a day or two after our first date together.  My situation is kind of unique, or at least it is within the circle of people I know. I met him in Team Fortress 2 and joined his gaming community, then we flirted aimlessly over voice chat for a few months. He bought Minecraft to play it with me and we built houses together, and we went in on the Portal 2 2-pack to play co-op XD I was mildly crushing on this charming Internet stranger the whole time, but having a history of dating crappy guys and being emotionally unstable in relationships myself, there was no way I was going to make a move. Finally one day he said he was planning a trip to my city, I was all ""WTF WHY?"" and he danced around it until I got him to confess that it was to see me. I helped him pick out a hotel room to stay in, and it was only after he finalized the reservations did he tell me he had feelings for me too.  He came up for a long weekend, and the only times we were apart was when one of us had to use the bathroom really - Otherwise we were basically attached at the hip soon as he came in through the door. Before he came up though I had made him sit through a couple hours of me listing all of the problems I have - Paranoia, trust issues, etc. - and what I expected out of a relationship (Long-term only with having kids in mind) to make my intentions very clear. It was genuine but it was also to give him plenty of heads up as to what he was getting into and provide him with any red flags he needed to bail early XD But he stuck through it. I caved and gave him my home address, and we just spent the first evening cudded up in my bed watching Justice league, Babylon 5, Doctor Who etc. etc. while my reformed stray cat made sure he didn't try anything funny. It was a fantastic weekend, and absolutely soul-crushing when he finally had to go home. We both cried.  So, I spent a few days kind of biting my lip on all the welling emotions inside of me. This guy was fucking amazing. He did everything right - He has this very relaxed and casual nature about him that counters my often anxious and neurotic nature so he drew me in from the start. He told me later that he was focussed on just making me comfortable that weekend, and hell, it worked XD Anyways, at some point he asked me what was wrong and wouldn't let me say ""Nothing"" and leave it be. I tried to go to bed but he texted me further, so I texted back that we needed to talk. So he called me. I started bawling my eyes out on the phone because I was so worked up in my own emotions and I'm really not very good at communicating verbally XD So I talked him into letting me text it out, THEN he could call with his response. I texted him that I love him, that the days since he left I'd been super emotional because I missed him an incredible amount, and admitted that I might be jumping the gun on the love thing because of the distance although it felt right to say. He said he kinda figured that was the case, since I'd been dropping not-so-subtle Alt+3 ♥'s when signing off, and he reciprocated and told me he loves me too. We then started planning our second date.  Anyways, several long-distance dates and a year later, still going strong. I'm moving to his city for October 1st, by this time next year one of us will likely be in school while the other works a good job while we live in our new house :P  ♥",♥

That does not mean it will happen, but I am well within my rights to say that that is not good enough and that they need to do more.

That's his choice, but it is my choice to question his motives and his philanthropy based on his choices.  Believe it or not ""billions upon billions"" is not good enough because only a small handful of the rich are doing that. They still own most wealth in the country/world.  &gt;Almost every multi-billionaire gives a preposterous amount of money to charity.  Yet they still have billions more, and there are still sick, poor, starving people. I am not asking to take bread from their table. I am asking them to share what they are able to. Nothing more. You are correct they are giving billions. But they are withholding a greater sum than what they give. Maybe that is actually optimal in some cases (it is Good™ to have very wealthy philanthropists, I suspect). But not all wealthy people are like that and it is *those* people I am after.",™

t5_2r9tk,Hiskitten,1343698958,"Okay, big wide question and answer here. Transparency: i haven't read 50 Shades and there's a bunch of reasons for that. Not in any order:  - from what i have read upon picking it up and trying to give it a shot, the vocabulary makes me cringe. It is sophomoric and sorry if this makes me sound like a snob but i cannot read when i am cringing with every passage.  - the main characters do not portray the lifestyle. The female character is a virgin who is taken against her will...that is not the hallmark of BDSM. If it is not SSC: Safe, Sane, Consensual, it is abuse and it is not what we're all about.  The male character - from the reviews and the people who are in the lifestyle have told me - is the kind of Dominant who isn't embracing the role he plays. Almost like a ""I'm going to do this to you now, whether you like it or not. Is that okay with you?"" Not quite the kind of Dominant this lifestyle produces. Yes, there is discussion with the submissive about his/her limits and preferences but once that's established, there's no ""is that okay with you?""  - The author did no research of lifestyle-related norms. From what i know, she went into a sex shop. In any writing, shouldn't the author write what s/he knows, or has found out through research? i feel she did our lifestyle a disservice by portraying it the way she does.  i have heard people talk about it. i have read and listened to reviews - in depth and with spoilers - done by those who are lifestyle oriented. i trust their opinions. So i am commenting from what i've heard - because i don't want to pay for a book that circumvents the requirements i need in place for enjoyment of that book. i think the author took shortcuts and to portray a lifestyle that inaccurately, one that may awaken the desires of others to enter into this lifestyle - well, it can be unhealthy or dangerous.  Now, as for BDSM? It is a vast, diverse, wonderful, wild, soothing, exhilarating, unique-to-everyone lifestyle. Everyone has their own dynamic and while there are a great many similarities, you'll find every partnership comes with its own rules, preferences, norms, rituals, protocols, definitions.  The key, for me, in this lifestyle is my desire to give my control to my Master, and have Him make the decisions for me. Not work-related, or as relates to my kids, but everything that has to do with me personally: my way of dressing, my way of behaving, my sexuality...etc. i breathe to obey Him, and whether that means i dress a certain way every Wednesday, or do my hair the way He likes it every day, or not use a color nail polish He doesn't want, or perform for Him sexually, *that* is my desire. i don't question Him nor does He ask my ""approval"" when He wants to do something.  For some, pain is not part of it. For me, it is a craving - and for my Master, it is a big part of who He is. Same goes for sensual humiliation. i know the book has a ""red room of pain"". Here's the thing: my Master has redefined every single room in the house and reserve His right to play with - or punish - me in every one so that there isn't one particular place for it. Some partners have a specific room - and that's what i mean by the unique nature of it. But the over-dramatization of  the 50 Shades milieu just seems to be over-the-top bodice-ripper stuff, not a true portrayal of what can be a very subtle, or very intense relationship.  Hope this helps. i think i'll probably end up borrowing the book(s) from a friend...someday. When i have nothing else to read.  my favorite literature in the lifestyle? i love Story of O - my Master and i read it together (He had me read aloud) and then we'd talk about it. i love all the anthologies of short stories edited by Rachel Kramer Bussel, Alison Tyler, and Cecilia Tan, to name 3. They are short, to the point, and very hot. But they are accurate, and closer to what i experience than the 50 Shades books.  Hope this helps... ☺",☺

t5_2rnve,AHairySomeone,1343704336,"Let me try to answer your GPU question. I'm not too experienced so PLEASE someone fix me if I'm wrong. NVidea cards are the most powerful on the market so yes, they are comparable. I think the most comparable NVidia card would be the 560TI. Your card lies higher than the 560 and lower than the 570. The Radeon cards use less power. If you want to save around $75 then go with the NVidea 560 stock.  As for which 7850 is better is up to you. Some have higher speeds at the cost of a little reliability. Some run a lot cooler than others. This I know to be true from my experience searching around for GTX 670s. Hope this helps.  EDIT: I looked on the AMD site for the minimum power for your GPU and looks like you're just over.   http://www.amd.com/us/products/desktop/graphics/7000/7850/Pages/radeon-7850.aspx#1  ""500W (or greater) power supply with one 75W 6-pin PCI Express power connector recommended 600W power supply (or greater) with two 75W 6-pin PCI Express power connectors recommended for AMD CrossFire™ technology.""",™
t5_2qqjc,aznsin12,1343704502,"MSG is still bad for you. I looked into the study and they were not looking for the right side effects: headaches, nausea, stomach pains, sensitivity to pain on skin. It is un-natural to ingest salt or MSG amounts to give that effect. Also, they are looking for ACUTE effects of MSG intake, not the chronic effects which can creep up on you later in life as the study in wiki looked into the effects on the day of ingestion.  The dependent variables that you need to look at are systolic/diastolic blood pressure, Heart rate, and blood volume. These are variables that can look into the effects of MSG ingestion and hypertension. You can also draw blood and see if there are increased reactive oxygen species which correlates to plaque build up. Unfortunately to study that I have will not be available to you unless you buy it. I'll give you the reference anyway. I have a PDF copy if you'd like. The study itself says that there is an increase in systolic blood pressure.  reference: Reducing Salt in Foods - Practical Strategies Edited by: Kilcast, David; Angus, Fiona © 2007 Woodhead Publishing Online version available at: http://www.knovel.com.proxy.queensu.ca/web/portal/browse/display?_EXT_KNOVEL_DISPLAY_bookid=1892&amp;VerticalID=0",©

We used software (Fitnext®, Caldogno, Vicenza, Italy) that includes 9 skinfolds (triceps, biceps, pectoral, subarmpit, subscapular, iliac crest, mid-abdominal, anterior thigh, medial calf), 6 bone circumferences (arm, forearm, waist, hip, thigh, calf), 4 bone diameters (elbow, wrist, knee, ankle), waistline and hip circumference measurement [24,44]). Anthropometric measurements were performed according to the Anthropometric Standardization Reference Manual [45]. Weight was measured to the nearest 0.1 kg using an electronic scale (Tanita BWB-800 Medical Scales, USA), and height to the nearest 1 cm using a Harpenden portable stadiometer (Holtain Ltd, UK). Skinfolds were measured to the nearest 1 mm using a Holtain caliper (Holtain Ltd, UK), and circumferences to the nearest 0.001 m using an anthropometric tape. All measurements were taken by the same operator (LC) before and during the study according to standard procedures [45,46]  So this was done with calipers, not BIA.

t5_2qi0s,velocom,1343754376,"The list of scientific studies which show the failure of helmets and mandatory helmets laws is long indeed. Here are just a small few...    Accid Anal Prev. 2001 Sep;33(5):687-91. Changes in head injury with the New Zealand bicycle helmet law. Robinson DL. Source  AGBU, University of New England, Armidale, NSW, Australia. drobinso@lash.une.edu.au Abstract  It was claimed that the bicycle helmet law in New Zealand reduced head injuries to adult cyclists by 28% (Povey, L.J., Frith, W.J., Graham, P.G., 1999. Cycle helmet effectiveness in New Zealand. Accident Analysis and Prevention 31, 763-770). However, the pre-law increase in adults wearing helmets (from 30% in 1990 to 43% in 1993) was accompanied by a fall of 45 head injuries per 100 limb injuries (i.e. -3.47 for every 1% increase in helmet wearing) compared with a fall of 11 when wearing increased from 43 to 93% with the law (-0.23 for every 1% increase in wearing). Unless voluntary wearing is 15 times more effective in reducing head injuries, it seems likely that the apparent effects (as described by Povey et al., 1999) were an artefact caused by failure to fit time trends in their model. Such inconsistency of effects over periods of substantial change compared with periods of little change in helmet wearing may be a useful indicator of the presence of trends. Because the large increases in wearing with helmet laws have not resulted in any obvious change over and above existing trends, helmet laws and major helmet promotion campaigns are likely to prove less beneficial and less cost effective than proven road-safety measures, such as enforcement of speed limits and drink-driving laws, education of motorists and cyclists and treatment of accident black spots and known hazards for cyclists. -------------------- Accid Anal Prev. 1996 Jul;28(4):463-75. Head injuries and bicycle helmet laws. Robinson DL. Source  AGBU, University of New England, Armidale, NSW, Australia. Abstract  The first year of the mandatory bicycle helmet laws in Australia saw increased helmet wearing from 31% to 75% of cyclists in Victoria and from 31% of children and 26% of adults in New South Wales (NSW) to 76% and 85%. However, the two major surveys using matched before and after samples in Melbourne (Finch et al. 1993; Report No. 45, Monash Univ. Accident Research Centre) and throughout NSW (Smith and Milthorpe 1993; Roads and Traffic Authority) observed reductions in numbers of child cyclists 15 and 2.2 times greater than the increase in numbers of children wearing helmets. This suggests the greatest effect of the helmet law was not to encourage cyclists to wear helmets, but to discourage cycling. In contrast, despite increases to at least 75% helmet wearing, the proportion of head injuries in cyclists admitted or treated at hospital declined by an average of only 13%. The percentage of cyclists with head injuries after collisions with motor vehicles in Victoria declined by more, but the proportion of head injured pedestrians also declined; the two followed a very similar trend. These trends may have been caused by major road safety initiatives introduced at the same time as the helmet law and directed at both speeding and drink-driving. The initiatives seem to have been remarkably effective in reducing road trauma for all road users, perhaps affecting the proportions of victims suffering head injuries as well as total injuries. The benefits of cycling, even without a helmet, have been estimated to outweigh the hazards by a factor of 20 to 1 (Hillman 1993. Cycle helmets-the case for and against. Policy Studies Institute, London). Consequently, a helmet law, whose most notable effect was to reduce cycling, may have generated a net loss of health benefits to the nation. Despite the risk of dying from head injury per hour being similar for unhelmeted cyclists and motor vehicle occupants, cyclists alone have been required to wear head protection. Helmets for motor vehicle occupants are now being marketed and a mandatory helmet law for these road users has the potential to save 17 times as many people from death by head injury as a helmet law for cyclists without the adverse effects of discouraging a healthy and pollution free mode of transport. --------------------- Risk Anal. 2012 May;32(5):782-90. doi: 10.1111/j.1539-6924.2011.01785.x. Epub 2012 Mar 2. The health impact of mandatory bicycle helmet laws. de Jong P. Source  Department of Applied Finance and Actuarial Studies, Macquarie University, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia. piet.dejong@mq.edu.au Abstract  This article seeks to answer the question whether mandatory bicycle helmet laws deliver a net societal health benefit. The question is addressed using a simple model. The model recognizes a single health benefit--reduced head injuries--and a single health cost-increased morbidity due to foregone exercise from reduced cycling. Using estimates suggested in the literature on the effectiveness of helmets, the health benefits of cycling, head injury rates, and reductions in cycling leads to the following conclusions. In jurisdictions where cycling is safe, a helmet law is likely to have a large unintended negative health impact. In jurisdictions where cycling is relatively unsafe, helmets will do little to make it safer and a helmet law, under relatively extreme assumptions, may make a small positive contribution to net societal health. The model serves to focus the mandatory bicycle helmet law debate on overall health.  © 2012 Society for Risk Analysis.",©

It's still that fairly thin bit of metal on 56 taking all the load of firing, but I guess that is a crazily low pressure.

Looking at your 870 diagram, I can guess how it works, but trying to figure out my 590 led me to the answer.  This quote from [here](http://www.aimprotactical.com/aimpro_frequently_asked_questions_faq.htm) confused me, so I had a play and figured out what was going on.  &gt;the Mossberg® bolt lock is a completely through the barrel bolt locking system. The square cut bolt lock is captured in a square cut-out in the barrel, so at the time of firing, the strength of the steel-on steel lock-up is unsurpassed.  http://i17.photobucket.com/albums/b81/caughthog/P1010974.jpg  the top bolt is how it normally looks, the bottom bolt has the square protruding, which fits into a cut out in the barrel, and can see it popping up and locking in through my ejection port as I close the action.  So 56 is just to keep the action from unlocking, that big solid lunk on the top front of 68 is what actually takes the pressure of firing. This is a much more satisfying answer to me.",®

The amount you limit yourself to will vary from person to person. Some people might consider anything more than 2 sets of clothes excessive, for others that just wouldn't be enough. Check out some packing lists on here and elsewhere and decide how much you want to take. I think this becomes more important when you are doing longer trips, but for 2 weeks it won't matter too much.  &gt; Would I then buy an outfit in the city I am in for the evening, then stuff it away?  You can bring clothes which can be used casually and for smart outfits. A pair of dark jeans, clean shoes and a t-shirt (or button down) is fine for a nightclub. Unless you are going to some swanky bar or club it won't matter too much what you wear as long as you aren't wearing a pair of shorts and sandals.  &gt; What cities or places would benefit me?

It's a great site and you can *easily* find a hostel you'll like.  &gt; how would I go about reserving ahead of time, is that even smart to do?  I would say yes, it is. The best hostels get fully booked quite far in advance during peak seasons, sometimes months in advance. You don't have to book everything far in advance, but I wouldn't be comfortable turning up in a popular city without a bed for the night. If you know where you want to go and don't mind having a set itinerary, then you'll be able to stay at really good hostels by booking in advance, and then you never have to worry about it again. Just use hostelbookers to make your reservation (it's really easy.)  &gt; Or any other countries to add to the list to make my 14 days do able?  I would recommend not trying to do too much.

You won't find many on reddit who think we're freer than Western Europe, and I don't think that's what the stamp is trying to say. I tend to view the whole obsession with freedom in America as having more to do with being thankful for what we have rather than nationalistic fervor and ""We're better than everyone else!""

Also, nobody who needs to hear about how America might not be The Best Country Ever™ is on reddit, so it's preaching to the choir. Europeans are constantly saying how ridiculous it is that we don't have socialized healthcare, that our college tuition costs are so high, that religion plays such a big role in politics, etc. etc. and everybody on reddit agrees and nothing changes because the other half of our country, the conservative, pro-America, anti-Europe crowd, isn't listening.   It's true that your country became free more recently, but Ireland as an entity existed long before colonial oppression was even an issue, and therefore it got the chance to form a cultural identity that had nothing to do with being free from the English (other than, I imagine, the desire to be free). According to Wikipedia, people have been living in Ireland for 9,000 years, whereas nobody from Europe was in America until a few hundred years ago. And we sort of had to make it up as we went along. So, in that sense, we were totally free do to whatever the hell we wanted, and there was seemingly endless land to do it on. We had to create a country from scratch. So I think that's what instilled this obsession with ""freedom"" in our national character. The original settlers arrived in a wild, rugged, and unexplored country, having to fend for themselves, figure out what crops would grow (if any), and defend themselves against Native Americans, who didn't take kindly to their land being stolen, as well as animals they might never have encountered before. This was especially true for the pioneers in the west, where the land is mountainous and the animals are big. So theoretically they had total freedom, and no government, but it wasn't exactly fun. Consequently freedom in this country is often associated with doing it yourself (without help from the government), no matter how tough it is.   The flag-waving and pledging of allegiance can also be explained by the ""we built this country ourself"" mindset (even if it was actually our ancestors) that a young country has. Perhaps it's also due to insecurity because we haven't been around for long-- even if we've accrued a great deal of power and economic might in that time-- and thus we feel the need to assert ourselves.   This has ended up a lot longer than I intended, because I had a lot to vent about, but I hope I've provided some small bit of enlightenment even though you had a fair point to begin with. ",™
