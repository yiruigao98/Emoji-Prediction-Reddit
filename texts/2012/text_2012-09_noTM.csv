Anyway, I came to say I feel for you and that I agree with you. The person that I am, even if I'm not ready right now or didt have sex on my min the same time as you, I'm only human and it takes but 60 seconds of kissing my sweet spots and showing general interest to get me ready. I have never turned down sex in a relationship. I can not fathom why someone would make a habit of it (I get the idea, kids, work, tired)   My ex had me so fucked up that I actually figured the way to solve the hurt of him not wanting to be intimate with me, was to stop liking sex. If I didn't like it, then I won't want it an wont be hurt when he says no. In hindsight this was a very bad idea bc it worked. It took all of a few weeks to convince myself that sex was disgusting and about 8-12 months to remember I love it 😔  I hope for your sake and the sake of your marriage, that your sex life gets better with your wife. Sex absolutely is important in any relationship. Not #1, but without it, you're roommates who share money...",😔

My mom died on July 29th of this year, at just 51 years of age. (Cancer sucks.) She and I didn't have the traditional ""special"" mother/daughter relationship that everyone seems to talk about, but we had a lot in common and we loved each other very much. At first I felt nothing, her death didn't seem real until I saw her at the wake, and then I cried for days. Now, the feelings come in waves seemingly at random. Sometimes I feel nothing and go about my day like everything is normal, sometimes I fear the possibility of what happened to her happening someone else I love or even myself, sometimes I feel inspired to do things to honor her memory/utilize the gifts she gave me/make her proud, and sometimes I feel really sad and wish things were different. The only consistent thing is that I always miss her. My husband lost his father almost ten years ago, and he tells me that's pretty much what it's like, though it does get easier to bear with time.  I wish I had some magical words to make you happy... but all I can say is I'm so sorry for your loss. ♥ hugs ♥  ",♥
t5_2qpp6,SadCritters,1346526943,"It's not a drop hack.  It is showing the SAME results as someone that uses a single-player ""Trainer"".  Trainers do things that modify the game's coding during single player and basically ""cheat"" for you.   Things include:  Invincible Units, Quick-Build, Instant Win, Reveal the Map, ETC.....  The problem is, these Trainers modify the game a little bit while you are playing ( though they are still external ). If you use one in multiplayer it causes a ""desync"" to happen where the games aren't agreeing on---For instance...Whether a Marine should be invincible or not. It then disconnects both players from the game and causes a tie. 8)  My friend had a ""Trainer"" he used for the single player campaign and tried this on me in a Custom game. It showed that exact same error: ""Desync"" and showed up as a tie.  That is likely what this person is doing---And I am sure that if you watch his APM before he loses entirely, he is alt-tabbing, loading the ""Trainer"", and telling it to do a few things to the game.   ♥  ( So it's...KINDA a ""drop hack""...But it really isn't. It's a program some script-kiddies made for single player so people could breeze through it or hunt achievements. 8) )",♥

t5_2qh6c,missssghost,1346602536,Doctors aren't perfect and sometimes their assumptions as to how much time a person has or how successful chemo and other medical procedures will work on that person are off or wrong. It's improbable for doctors to be 100% great at predicting outcomes.   I think it's more likely that the medical help she's received has probably helped shrink her tumours more so than one prayer.  I don't think that should get in the way of your promise to God and yourself to be a better Christian though.

t5_2qh13,hassani1387,1346674547,"Sorry I will tske the word of the UN commission on internationsl law and a ICJ judge over yours. The IAEA by the way is not authorized to demand any ""mandatory duspensions"" since the IAEA isnt even in chsrge of the NPT - which is why IAEA board members include non-NPT signatories auch as India.   But since you think googli.g a law review and then quoting back massive texr somehow proves a point:  ""Peremptory norms exist to protect the values and interests that are fundamentally important to the international community as a whole. As Judge Lauterpacht emphasized in the Bosnia case, jus cogens unconditionally binds the Security Council and this was implied also in the Tadic case. Moreover, it was very recently corroborated in the Kadi case before the Court of First Instance of European Communities, where the Court ruled that it was 'empowered to check, indirectly, the lawfulness of the resolutions of the Security Council in question with regard to jus cogens, understood as a body of higher rules of public international law binding on all subjects of international law, including the bodies of the United Nations, and from which no derogation is possible'. In line with the last ruling is also the doctrine as far as the conceptual basis of this approach is concerned: the Security Council must respect peremptory norms because the core values protected by jus cogens are not derogable or waivable in the sense of jus dipositivum. Moreover, it should be acknowledged that, as when concluding a treaty, States cannot be presumed to authorize acts contrary to jus cogens, a fortiori when they establish an international organization, they cannot avoid their operation either. This is affirmed also by the principle that States cannot delegate to it more powers than they themselves can exercise (nemo plus juris transfere quam ipse habet). Acts contra juris gestionis are beyond the powers of an institution, in casu the Security Council and therefore the provisions of the UN Charter on the latter's powers have to be interpreted and executed in a way that is compatible with peremptory norms. In addition, it is argued that not only are the Council's Resolutions part of a secondary law subjected to the Charter, but also part of a system, which in its entirety is subordinated to jus cogens.

t5_2qh1a,argv_minus_one,1346687188,"&gt;Here is a software engineer, a programmer with 12 years of running GNU/Linux day in and day out  I am also a software engineer and I have also run GNU/Linux day in and day out for about the same length of time. I am not some noob that doesn't know what he's talking about.  &gt;Let me tell you, that god damn shit piece of work called pulseaudio does not share audio among multiple devices.  1. Yes it does. 2. That's not what I was talking about. I was talking about the exact opposite: sharing one device among multiple applications.  &gt;It does not allow you to even output your audio on one device while playing on another.  Funny you should mention that, seeing as how I've used it to do exactly that.  &gt;If its one thing that pissed me off the most about all my experiences using gnu/linux, from having to tweak irq-numbers in the early days to get my ISA soundcard to work, god damn pulseaudio fuck it to hell and all its false promises. Pulseaudio is a horrible piece of shit software with an even more horrible documen-tation to speak of. The first thing I ever do on any linux is to scan for and delete all traces of its god damn name.  Status of jimmies: ☐ not rustled ☑ rustled  &gt;Mind you, letting several applications use the soundcard at once is something ALSA does very very well, without even noticing it, it just works, all the applications can play music at the same time, its like a wonder!  Haha, what? Are you dropping acid, son? The only way you can accomplish that with only ALSA is `dmix`, you have to tweak undocumented configuration files in order to use it, it adds massive latency, and you still can't both play audio and record audio through the same device at the same time.  &gt;The reason for pulseaudio was having networked sound, something arts and esd tried to do, and they still do that better than turd.  &amp;hellip;you're hallucinating. That's the only conclusion I can draw from this nonsensical diatribe. Seek professional help; you clearly need it.",☑
t5_2tnz9,RiseAM,1346687599,"The actual, pedantic, grammar nazi answer is this:  &gt; Which is correct as the plural of LEGO: 'Lego' or 'Legos'? Neither, actually. The word 'LEGO', when used as a noun, should only refer to the company that makes the product. Otherwise 'LEGO' is supposed to be used as an adjective. Thus, when referring to the pieces, neither 'lego' nor 'legos' is correct... rather one should say: 'LEGO bricks' or 'LEGO pieces' or whatever (using LEGO as an adjective -- and one should really capitalize all of the letters, and put the little 'circle-R' symbol after it (®)). This is all a matter of protecting the trademark of 'LEGO' for the company (using it otherwise degenerates the strength of the trademark). This is not to say that I use the word correctly 100% of the time... but that's the answer to the question (it's always fun/painful to read the near-flame-wars that start at slashdot.org over this topic... and generally, both sides are wrong).

You're not really there to make friends, but to dance, so focus on learning the steps and getting the cues, and you'll be outstanding.  I actually do better in things (where I'm expected to perform) if I don't have my goofy friends around to act up with. :) You might find you like it that way.

Sorry I didn't consider that, was just excited to post ‼FINDINGS‼   This is a picture of Two levels; z0 and z1.   I figured out that marksdwarves who stand next to fortifications get mutilated by Clowns;   I also figured out marksdwarves who stand farther away from fortifications get mutilated by clowns;   So I put em up on a ledge 1Z level up and 1 tile  away for maximum accuracy.  I dug out a 5x5 no slope moat around the 4x4 fortifications so that marksdwarves don't go down;   Rather shoot from 1z up so they can't be targeted by fireballs or AoE vapors;  I didn't find a good explanation on the wiki... it just said use fortifications;but becareful cause they're not almighty, well they are almighty if you shoot from 1z up.",‼

[Mary Magdalene: The Hidden Apostle](http://store.aetv.com/html/catalog/vp01.jhtml?id=17903)     “The first person to whom Jesus appeared after his resurrection has been the victim of a 2,000-year smear campaign. This groundbreaking profile strives to set the record straight.”          “Mary Magdalene was not a prostitute. Rather, she, was a woman of wealth whose financial support was crucial to the early survival of Christianity. But, as BIOGRAPHY® reveals, the special relationship she had with Christ led to resentment among the other disciples, and her reputation was tarnished as a result. Drawing on ancient texts, rare art and the research of top scholars at Harvard, Yale, Catholic University and the University of Wisconsin, this far-reaching portrait compares the evidence we have with the stories we have heard--and tries to reconcile them.”          “She was a disciple who believed in the word of the Lord long before many others, yet her reward was to be misrepresented for millennia!",®

t5_2qh3p,MCEnergy,1346869851,"Hey Scruff13,  There are a few things you can do to make yourself into a good Dom. We'll focus on this since Subs require very different qualities.  1) *Create a contract. *  A contract is an agreement that sets limits, boundaries, roles, and responsibilities. You don't have to write one out, but it should be clear and all-encompassing. Here's a link to figuring out which questions matter to you, the Dom. [http://bit.ly/OkLifQ](http://bit.ly/OkLifQ).  2) *Practice What You Preach*  It is absolutely fundamental that you are **consistent**. If you do not create trust, and keeping your word and acting predictably is crucial, then your sub will not respect your Word.   3) *Kill the Ego, Man*  Being a Dom can be difficult because you assert so much control over ""scenes"" (sex-related D/S) that it can leak over into social life. Your Sub may enjoy being called slave in the bedroom, but in front of their friends, it can create problems for him/her. So, establish key words that *begin* scenes, and key words that *end* scenes.   4) *Build It Up*  Your Sub should thrive on anticipation and release, the driving factors to a good domination. The more that you establish atmosphere and authority, the more that your sub will acknowledge your Presence. Clear speech, automatic punishments, and pure attention and acknowledgment increase dominance. Sloppiness, forgetfulness, or even the briefness of a scene can lead to the sub feeling confused, disillusioned, put off. So, plan your scenes! And ask your sub tons of questions. You can do that.   5) *Make Them Cum*  Scenes can be all well and good, but sometimes they just don't cut it, when it comes to sexual pleasure. Your sub deserves rewards. How much anticipation they must endure, and how many hoops that they have to jump through to receive their reward is simply a factor of your strictness.   6) *Make Up and Debrief* Dom/subbing takes a lot out of you. Physically, psychologically, and emotionally, it bears a tax. Make sure that you have a conversation with your sub about what each of you experienced. It is important that both partners discuss their high/low points and perhaps explain inconsistencies in behaviour.  Types of Disclipline:  *Humiliation* Transgression – Stand in corner, in public Sub sleeps at edge of bed, or outside, etc. Repeat a phrase, “I'm a naughty, little sub,” etc.  *Physical Domination* Domme sleeps with sex in subs mouth. Must wake up to the same thing. Domme leads sub around the house, with hand on shoulder, neck, head, etc. Domme directs sub's body position and how long (s)he is to hold it. Bondage play. Instruct him/her that (s)he is never to touch your body without permission.  *Verbal Domination* Nickname of demeaning status. May not speak unless ________. Can only request to speak, does not have the right to. May not moan during sexual pleasure  Types of Reward: Emotional 	Flower; nice message in the morning; activity, task, or chore; help, etc.  Physical 	massage; caressing; bath, etc. Sexual 	Choice of activity, position, or period of time. 	Choice of where Domme cums. 	Choice of place, or of which boundary to push.  Last but not least, is the sub's rights. Make sure that (s)he reads this aloud, to you. I feel that that establishes a true understanding of respectable boundaries for the sub.  *Rights of the sub* ""I have the right to set limits, and expect them to be respected. I have the right to adjust these limits at any time, with notice to you. I have the right to expect you to push them, to force me to create new limits and boundaries.  I have the right to privacy. I expect you to be concerned about time we spend apart, but I expect you to understand that I am a person, separate from you, and thusly having problems and situations in my life that I will not need your help with. I have the right to expect you will respect me for my independence and not criticize me for it. I have the right to ask you for help, should I need it. I have the right to be trusted, providing I have earned it, and I have the right to expect you to believe I am an intelligent, caring and loyal person.  I have the right to ask things of you, and have you listen to my requests. I have the right to ask for your attention, without having to misbehave to get it. I have the right to ask you to contribute as much to this relationship as I do. As long as my requests are submitted respectfully, I expect you to consider them as you would from any friend or colleague. I have the right to question your motives, should you deny my requests, as long as I do so with the proper respect.  I have the right to expect you to administer punishment with care and caution. I have the right to use my safewords at any point, should I feel them necessary. I have the right to get up and walk away from a scene if you have crossed the line. I have the right to expect you to respect my decisions, and not think less of me, or abandon me for them.  I have the right to speak up if I feel our relationship is not giving me what I need. I have the right to tell you what I need, in a respectful manner. I have the right to expect you to understand my reasons for doing so, and the right to expect you to listen with an open mind. I have the right to walk away from the relationship if we cannot come to a common ground on these issues.  I have the right to expect tenderness, love and understanding after a scene is completed, should it be what I desire. I have the right to ask you for that tenderness if I've had a bad day, or if I just feel the need for closeness. I understand that there will be times when you and I will disagree about this -- when you will want a scene, and I will not. I have the right to call for a talk about this, and to expect you to listen to and consider my reasonings. I expect you to have the final word, but I expect you to wholeheartedly consider my feelings, whatever they may happen to be.  I have the right to expect our relationship to progress, for trust to continually be renewed, for our souls to be as close as our bodies are. I have the right to tell you if I need more from you, and I expect you to respect my decisions about what I want and need. I expect you to want the relationship to progress, unless decided otherwise beforehand. I expect you to understand that deep trust often breeds love, and I expect you not to repel me if I tell you that I love you. For I will love you, my master, should our relationship move ahead, should our trust continue to grow.  I have the right to expect you to tell me, at any point, if you do not feel you can return those feelings, so that I may decide what I want and need. For it is your pleasure that adds to my own, makes it real. And mine, that adds to yours."" Copyright ©1995 TheScreamer   That last bit is not mine, clearly, but I believe it to be an integral part of forming your identity as a Dom, in relation to your sub. Have fun out there!",©

Its the commandment to love one another or thy neighbor as one would love themselves. it's also pointed out to not judge anyone in a couple of areas such as ""Judge not, lest ye be judged. Let those without sin cast out the first stone. and, my personal favorite, to impose god's will, by force, on those not following it is actually STEALING GLORY FROM GOD. Here ya go, check out this scripture about vengeance.:   Romans 12:19 New Living Translation (©2007) Dear friends, never take revenge. Leave that to the righteous anger of God. For the Scriptures say, ""I will take revenge; I will pay them back,"" says the LORD.  If going out and protesting against those that do not follow your god's rules, and voting en masse intentionally to deny a group of people the same rights that you enjoy specifically because the bible states god doesn't like those types of people isn't attempts at revenge, I don't know what is.

t5_2s3yz,stoonedjesus,1346878139,"&gt;Female (♀) is the sex of an organism, or a part of an organism, which produces non-mobile ova (egg cells).  &gt;Defining characteristics The ova are defined as the larger gametes in a heterogamous reproduction system, while the smaller, usually motile gamete, the spermatozoon, is produced by the male. A female individual cannot reproduce sexually without access to the gametes of a male (an exception is parthenogenesis). Some organisms can reproduce both sexually and asexually. There is no single genetic mechanism behind sex differences in different species and the existence of two sexes seems to have evolved multiple times independently in different evolutionary lineages[citation needed]. Patterns of sexual reproduction include isogamous species with two or more mating types with gametes of identical form and behavior (but different at the molecular level), anisogamous species with gametes of male and female types, oogamous species in which the female gamete is very much larger than the male and has no ability to move. There is an argument that this pattern was driven by the physical constraints on the mechanisms by which two gametes get together as required for sexual reproduction.[1] Other than the defining difference in the type of gamete produced, differences between males and females in one lineage cannot always be predicted by differences in another. The concept is not limited to animals; egg cells are produced by chytrids, diatoms, water moulds and land plants, among others. In land plants, female and male designate not only the egg- and sperm-producing organisms and structures, but also the structures of the sporophytes that give rise to male and female plants.",♀

t5_2qpp6,SadCritters,1346879407,"It doesn't have to modify Idra's game.  It can modify the other player's (Hacker's ) game instead.  All a ""Desync"" means is that the two games are disagreeing on the values being used in the game for say---Whether or not units instant build from a Barracks ( Which we both know they don't. ). These values can be anything from revealing the entire map, to ""invincible units"", to infinite minerals/gas, etc ( I think you get the point. ).  The ""Single Player Trainer"" is a program that does this for the campaign. It's a third-party program that enables these things in the campaign of the game and allows people to breeze through it, hunt portraits/achievements, whatever they want....By cheating further than Blizzard would allow you to. It causes the values of certain game elements to change.  When you use this program in a multiplayer setting, you are modifying your files/values for the game.   So the following essentially happens:  My game, without the ""trainer"", tells you that my Zerglings have a certain amount of health. You attack me, I am losing, I'm this sore-loser piece of crap....And suddenly alt-tab and turn the ""Trainer"" on. Suddenly my game is now trying to tell your game that my Zerglings never die. Your game stops, analyzes this...And says..""What? That's not right."". It tries to communicate with mine further, and the two games cannot reach an agreement ( the ""desync"" ). The game disconnects us both, because Blizzard originally assumes that these ""Desync"" errors are connection/battle.net/program errors on their part and doesn't want either player to get hurt as a result of this....So it ends in a tie. 'Something mutally neutral for both parties.   Tl;DR: You don't have to modify the other persons' game ( Idra's )...You just have to confuse it by changing yours. ♥",♥

t5_2qh1i,wekulm,1346948097,"      Desiderata       Go placidly amid the noise and haste, and remember what                         peace there may be in silence.       As far as possible without surrender be on good terms with all              persons.       Speak your truth quietly and clearly; and listen to others, even              the dull and ignorant; they too have their story.       Avoid loud and aggressive persons, they are vexations to the              spirit.       If you compare yourself with others, you may become vain and              bitter;       for always there will be greater and lesser persons than              yourself.              Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans.       Keep interested in your career, however humble; it is a real              possession in the changing fortunes of time.       Exercise caution in your business affairs; for the world is full of              trickery.       But let this not blind you to what virtue there is; many persons              strive for high ideals;       and everywhere life is full of heroism.        Be yourself.       Especially, do not feign affection.       Neither be critical about love; for in the face of all aridity and              disenchantment it is as perennial as the grass.        Take kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering the              things of youth.       Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune. But              do not distress yourself with imaginings.       Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness. Beyond a              wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself.        You are a child of the universe, no less than the trees and the              stars;       you have a right to be here.       And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is              unfolding as it should.              Therefore be at peace with God, whatever you conceive Him to              be,       and whatever your labors and aspirations, in the noisy              confusion of life keep peace with your soul.       With all its sham, drudgery and broken dreams, it is still a              beautiful world. Be cheerful. Strive to be happy.              © Max Ehrmann 1927",©

t5_2r0gj,kingofharts,1346953190,"Joseph Smith never had relations with Fanny eh bishop?? Here's some info from that book you supposedly read..  Alger was fourteen when her family joined the Church in Mayfield, near Kirtland, in 1830. In 1836, after a time as a serving girl in the Smith household, she left Kirtland and soon married. Between those two dates, perhaps as early as 1831, she and Joseph were reportedly involved, but conflicting accounts make it difficult to establish the facts— much less to understand Joseph’s thoughts. Was he a blackguard covering his lusts with religious pretensions, or a prophet doggedly adhering to instructions from heaven, or something in between?  ....  The Far West court did not accuse Joseph of being involved with Alger. Some councilors had heard the rumors, but concluded they were untrue. They were concerned only with Cowdery’s insinuations. He was on trial for false accusations, not Joseph for adultery. David Patten, an apostle, “went to Oliver Cowdery to enquire of him if a certain story was true respecting J. Smith’s committing adultery with a certain girl, when he turned on his heel and insinuated as though he was guilty.” Thomas Marsh, another apostle, reported a similar experience. “Oliver Cowdery cocked up his eye very knowingly and hesitated to answer the question, saying he did not know as he was bound to answer the question yet conveyed the idea that it was true.” George Harris testified that in conversation between Cowdery and Joseph the previous November, Cowdery “seemed to insinuate that Joseph Smith jr was guilty of adultery.” Eventually the court concluded that Cowdery had made false accusations, and cut him off from the Church. 7 Cowdery denied that he had lied about Joseph and Alger. Cowdery had heard the accusations against him when he wrote to Joseph in January 1838. “I learn from Kirtland, by the last letters, that you have publickly said, that when you were here I confessed to you that I had willfully lied about you.” He demanded that Joseph retract the statement. In a letter to his brother Warren, Cowdery insisted he would never dishonor the family name by lying about anything, much less about the Smiths, whom he had always defended. In his conversations with Joseph, Cowdery asserted, “in every instance, I did not fail to affirm that what I had said was strictly true,” meaning he believed Joseph did have an affair. His insinuations were not lies but the truth as he understood it.  ...  These scraps of testimony recorded within a few years of the Alger business show how differently the various parties understood events. In the contemporaneous documents, only one person, Cowdery, believed that Joseph had had an affair with Fanny Alger. Others may have heard the rumors, but none joined Cowdery in making accusations. 11 David Patten, who made inquiries in Kirtland, concluded the rumors were untrue. No one proposed to put Joseph on trial for adultery. Only Cowdery, who was leaving the Church, asserted Joseph’s involvement. On his part, Joseph never denied a relationship with Alger, but insisted it was not adulterous. He wanted it on record that he had never confessed to such a sin. Presumably, he felt innocent because he had married Alger.  **TL;DR - Oliver Cowdery accused Joseph Smith of being an adulterer (with Fanny Alger), and his allegations resulted in excommunication. Joseph Smith never denied having sexual relations with Fanny, he simply denied that that they were ""adulterous"", and actually felt innocent because these relations were, he felt, under a genuine, sanctified marriage. If your bishop denies Joseph Smith having relations with 14 year old girls (somewhere around this young age), and he actually read Rough Stone Rolling, he obviously wasn't reading hard enough.

t5_2qzb6,unsound,1346974332,"I posted this farther down -  There's something incrediby fishy about this guy and this entire setup.  The bottom of his website states ""© 2012 {ALOMEDIA} ~ WEBSITE BY ALOMEDIA.NET"". Alomedia is supposedly a web design company, but only lists three clients: 1) a site called 'ULUCKYGIRL', which states that it was in fact developed by a different company - Ideal Growth, 2) His site davidseamanforcongress.com, and finally 3) Deepellumonair.com, a texas based radio station which advertises itself as '100%' local.  So here's a few things:  * His biography at http://alomedia.net/portfolio/david-seaman-for-congress/ states that you have ""been a guest on CNN Headline News, FOX News, ABC News Digital"", yet I can't seem to find these appearances online, or any mention of them on his site.  * Why has Deepellumonair.com, a supposedly 100% local Texas radio station, has been so interested in promoting a Congressional candidate for FL-20?  * His twitter account constantly discusses donations  Combined with the comments above, my general impression is that nothing about this guy is genuine.  So here's my guess: David Seaman is a 26 year old who used to work in online media who is now using internet freedom as a platform to drive donations for a campaign he doesn't really intend to win. My guess is that he's in this to make a lot of money from hype and internet scaremongering - something reddit typically loves to engage in. ",©

t5_2r2o9,angrybiologist,1347011749,"Additionally, at that point in time, House Stark is on the verge of extinction. We're not told of any extended Stark family, and, presumably, Brandon and Lyanna died childless. Only Ned and Benjen are left to rebuild their house.   It seems weird to me that Benjen would leave it all up to Ned to rebuild the Stark line (Ned could still be seen as a rebel lord after all these years as Robert claims *there are some people who still call [him] usurper* so there is still a little danger there that the Stark house could perish). I don't know if at that time Robb is already born, but that shouldn't have been enough reason for Benjen to take the Black so young--I think it more reasonable for Benjen to go on as bannerman for a time, until he had sons that could be his heir, then take the Black.   Also we see there are several reasons why men join the NW: duty (Mormont, Royce?), punishment (thieves and rapers), coercion (Thorne, Tarly, Royce?), outgrown usefulness (Noyle, Gendry?), safety (Targaryen, Gendry?). I don't think Benjen went under punishment/coercion/outgrown usefulness, and I think he's too young for duty (because he seems to regret it as he tries to persuade Jon to reconsider what he's asking), that leaves safety as a possible reason (to avoid being used for the secret of R♥L=J).

I'm an intermediate guitar player but I have and ear 😓. Good luck and practice a lot! Also, you can try signing with your guitar and looking up stuff on the Internet. The interment is a great source for everything. Also, you can try tuning you guitar without a tuner to help develope your ear, but have a tuner in handy (if you have an iPhone or something you can get an app for this). Learn how to tune strings using other strings, and check with the tuner to see how well you did. After that you fix it. Guitar strings will go out of tune every now and then do you'll get lots of chances to practice. You will get even more practice if you change tunings a lot, although it is a pain. ",😓

t5_2qqjc,Mr_B0X,1347163367,"This friends of reddit is the VASIMR® VX-200, a plasma rocket prototype that will change the future of space travel forever.  Small explanation: The plasma rocket does not provide much thrust but rather uses small plasma bursts in frictionless space to continually add force to the traveling object, increasing the speed with every burst to never before reached speeds, making interstellar travel possible!  The VASIMR® engine works with plasma, a very hot gas, at temperatures close to the interior of the Sun. Plasmas are electrically charged fluids that can be heated to extreme temperatures by radio waves and controlled and guided by strong magnetic fields. The magnetic field also insulates any nearby structure, so temperatures well beyond the melting point of materials can be achieved and the resulting plasma can be harnessed to produce propulsion. In rocket propulsion, the higher the temperature of the exhaust gases, the higher their velocity and hence the higher their fuel efficiency. Plasma rockets feature exhaust velocities far above those achievable by their chemical cousins, so their fuel consumption is extremely low and their fuel-related costs substantially reduced.",®

Even if you didn't ever use it IV or contract the disease that way, your COD is ""heroin"".  Luckily, I did find some more specific statistics.  They still have the problem of over-implicating opiates in multiple drug overdoses because they only use the ""first-listed"" drug in multiple drug ODs as the ""drug of fault"", but it avoids some of the other common problems:  http://www.hhs.gov/asl/testify/2008/03/t20080312b.html  ""With the latest, 2005 death data, we were able to drill down even further and look at the specific drugs causing the deaths.  For deaths with multiple drugs involved, we looked at only the first-listed drug, which is a method to assign responsibility when multiple drugs are involved. This analysis showed that opioid painkillers were still the most commonly found drugs, accounting for 38.2% of the first-listed drugs, with methadone by itself contributing to almost half of these deaths. Benzodiazepine sedatives such as Valium® and antidepressants accounted for 6.5%. Even without including the category of “other specified drugs,” which are mostly prescription, the total of prescription opioids, benzodiazepines, and antidepressants (about 45%), exceeds the total of cocaine, heroin, and methamphetamines/amphetamines (about 39%).""  You'll also notice that multiple drug ODs vastly outnumber single drug ODs by reading further into the document.  You'll also notice that Methadone is responsible for far more deaths than Heroin.  And as I've said before, everything is dangerous under certain conditions.  It's a non-sequitur.  You can kill yourself with water or oxygen.",®

t5_2qhk2,IanRankin,1347254149,"Microsoft only has *wired* controller support for the Xbox 360.   That being said, what you're looking for is [Xbox Controller Driver](http://www.redcl0ud.com/xbcd.html) or (XBCD). This would allow you to use any USB-compatible controllers and emulate the 360 controller. So instead of spending a lot of money on a wired 360 official controller, you can buy any sort of USB-compatible controller and use that. If you want to avoid all this trouble and don't mind the extra cost, you'll just want to buy a Wired 360 controller and download that software for your computer/laptop. Microsoft also has what is called a Microsoft® gaming receiver for Windows® that allows you to plugin wireless controllers into your PC. It is a discontinued product though, I think..but Amazon is showing them for less than $20 [here](http://www.amazon.com/Xbox-360-Wireless-Gaming-Receiver-Windows/dp/B000HZFCT2/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1347289435&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=Microsoft%C2%AE+gaming+receiver+for+Windows%C2%AE).  Many people have problems installing the driver that comes with the XBCD 0.2.7 release. I just told Windows to allow the unsigned drivers and was good to go.  Download http://www.mediafire.com/?32e4566jjj5nzja - XBCD 0.2.7 Release  This is mainly just used for the drivers. Once this is installed there are 2 options for setting up the files needed for emulation  You can use the app version: x360ce.App-2.0.2.158.  &gt; &gt;With this once extracted run the x360ce.exe and it should determine what controller you have and load a profile for you. If it does not you can setup which buttons you want to do what. Once saved this adds 2 more files to the folder than the exe is in : &gt;x360ce.ini &gt;xinput1_3.dll &gt; &gt;Some games use different .dll names - the 4 they could be are : &gt;xinput1_1.dll &gt;xinput1_2.dll &gt;xinput1_3.dll &gt;xinput9_1_0.dll &gt; &gt;What I did , instead of trial and error to see which one works, was make one of each and I just copy all 4 into the game directory along with the ini file. .  Or use the manual config version: x360ce_vibmod_3.1.4.1.  &gt;With this you have to manual edit the x360ce.ini file(in notepad or any text editor) and add the VID &amp; PID, which are easy to find. &gt; &gt;Control Panels &gt; System &gt; Device manager &gt; Human Interface Device &gt; find your controller listed&gt; right click &gt; properties &gt; details &gt; switch the drop down to hardware Ids. It will list both your VID &amp; PID &gt; &gt;Enter those in the top of the x360ce.ini &gt; &gt;VID=0x045E                   #controller VID &gt;PID=0x0289                   #controller PID &gt; &gt; &gt;Also change the FakeAPI=0 to FakeAPI=1 Save the file. &gt; &gt;Test the setup with the included XInputTest.exe to make sure all the buttons function correctly. &gt; &gt;Same here, you want 4 dll files : &gt;xinput1_1.dll &gt;xinput1_2.dll &gt;xinput1_3.dll &gt;xinput9_1_0.dll &gt; &gt;and the &gt; &gt;x360ce.ini &gt; &gt;and you will copy them to the the game install directory.

It was the only register open so there wasn't much of another option to get my 12 pack of Mountain Dew for a party I was heading to. I was wondering why the line was going nowhere when I decided to poke my head up front to see what the holdup was. It was a little old lady who didn't have enough for her groceries and she was trying to talk the cashier into letting her get away with being short. This struck me as odd until I found out she was a mere $0.21 short of her purchase. Now all these families were just staring and there was even two making fun of her. I walked up and handed my soda to the cashier, handed him a $5 and told her to keep the change. One of the kids in line (a BurgerKing employee..I knew these people, so I also knew that they all make over 6 digits) grabbed his swagalicious friend and yelled very loudly, ""See that man? He's acting just like Waka Flocka Flame wants us to."" For some reason this set me off, so I turned around. I haven't shaved in awhile so I'm rocking some nice scruff, a My Little Pony shirt, and gym shorts, so it must have been a nice sight. Very loudly, I said ""Like Waka Flocka? Good gentlemanly sir, I'm a redditor who doesn't practic swagism and I was the one who stepped up to help her? Your hypocritical practice of swag^® is an inspiration to us all.""

(1)Systemic nicotine stimulates human adipose tissue lipolysis through local cholinergic and catecholaminergic receptors, K Andersson and P Arner, International Journal of Obesity.  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11477508)   (2) http://articles.elitefts.com/training-articles/women-running-into-trouble/  When I look at the fat guy in the gym wasting his time on forearm curls to lose weight, I don’t feel sympathy. The big tough guy getting stapled to the bench by 365 pounds, when just a second ago he couldn’t even handle 315 pounds — nope, no sympathy there either. The girl who spends thirty minutes bouncing between the yes-no machines (abductor and adductor machines), who is going to have trouble walking the next day — I can’t muster even an iota of pathos. Nobody told them to do these things. But then I watch my friend, Jessica, running on the treadmill, day after day, year after year, running like a madwoman and going nowhere. Her body seems to get softer with every mile and the softer she gets the more she runs. I do feel pity for her because everybody, everywhere has convinced her that running is the way to stay slim and toned.  There’s a Jessica in every gym and spotting one is easy. The woman that runs for an hour or more every day on the treadmill, who every month or so sets a new distance or time goal. Maybe the goal encompasses the treadmill workouts; maybe it will be her fifth fund-raising marathon; or maybe she’s competing with runners in Finland via Nike®. The goal doesn’t matter, because years of seeing her on the treadmill exposes the results: she’s still — I’m not going to sugar coat this — fat. Or worse, she’s fatter....... Think about it this way: the body is a responsive, adaptive machine evolved for survival. If running on a regular basis, the body senses excessive energy expenditure and adjusts to compensate. Remember, no matter what dreamy nonsense we invent about how we hope the body works, its endgame is always survival. Start wasting energy running and the body reacts by slowing the metabolism to conserve energy. Decreasing energy output is biologically savvy for the body: survive longer while doing this stressful, useless activity — as the body views it. Decreasing T3 production, increases efficiency and adjusts metabolism to preserves energy quickly.  Nothing exemplifies this increasing efficiency better than how the body starts burning fuel. Training at a consistently plus-65 percent heart rate adapts the body to save as much body fat as possible. That’s right, after regular training, fat cells stop releasing fat during moderate-intensity activities like they once did.32-33 Energy from body fat stores decreases by a whopping 30 percent. 34-35 To this end, the body even sets into motion a series of reactions that make it difficult for muscle to burn fat at all.36-41 Instead of burning body fat, the body is taking extraordinary measures to hold on to it. Still believe cardio is the fast track to fat loss?  But wait. By acting now, you too can lose muscle mass. That’s right. No more muscle because too much steady-state cardio triggers the loss of muscle.42-45 This seems to be a two-fold mechanism, with heightened and sustained cortisol levels triggering muscle loss,46-56 which upregulates myostatin, a potent destroyer of muscle tissue.57 Oh yeah — say good bye to bone density too — it declines with the muscle mass and strength.58-64 And long-term health? Out the window as well. The percentage of muscle mass is an independent indicator of health.65 Lose muscle, lose bone, lose health—all in this nifty little package.   ",®

t5_2rfxx,petapanfriedrice,1347321747,"Original post is worth a look too...its a bit heartbreaking actually  &gt;http://na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=2557429  &gt;Some people actually get upset because of what you say.  &gt;I'm going to be as truthful as possible right now. I'm 24 years old and I have social anxiety disorder. I'm also borderline bi-polar. I take medication that helps me not have mood swings without any explanation but I still react to real things accordingly. The only problem is when I do react to things the emotion is usually exaggerated. I don't mean that it's unreasonable, but if you and I both were sad over the same exact thing I would be more sad. The same for anger, joy, and so on.  &gt;My ignore feature has been bugged since five or six patches ago and I'm no longer able to ignore other players. My ignore list isn't full. Thus, while in-game, I have to deal with what other people say. I'm a young adult. I understand what that all means. The problem is that it's a lot easier to get a rise out of me than with other people. If people are condescending me non-stop I will tell them that it's making me upset. I always read the chat and unless I'm very focused on a fight it's very hard for me to ignore.  &gt;At the end of my games I say ""Thank you for the game everyone, have a nice day."" I've always been extremely empathetic and very caring of other people. It doesn't matter if they are strangers or not because I can't help but be that way. I was raised to be polite and understanding of others. As I grew up living on my own I made it a point to always be respectable and kind to others because that's how I would like to be treated.  &gt;So, when I respond to people that spit about a myriad of degrading remarks it seems like that gives them the go-ahead to say even more mean things. Eventually my feelings overcome my ability to be calm and I get upset. I don't generally get angry, just sad. There's a quote from 'The Green Mile' that has stuck with me for a long time.  &gt;""Mostly I'm tired of people being ugly to each other. I'm tired of all the pain I feel and hear in the world everyday. There's too much of it. It's like pieces of glass in my head all the time. Can you understand?""  &gt;That's how I feel when people are being so downright awful during the game. Yet, if I try to say anything about it they just turn the cruelty up a notch and lay it on even thicker. When I tell people I'm considering reporting them for verbal abuse they just press on and be as antagonizing as possible. Generally people say to 'suck it up' or 'stop being a baby.' The only thing is, I'm not being a child about it. I don't like having mean things said to me so I want you to stop. Where is the wrong in that?  &gt;It isn't my fault that I developed these problems that hinder my control of my emotions. It isn't my fault that I sweat uncontrollably when I start having anxiety. I don't like to have a slew of unpleasant feelings coursing through my veins and I don't like having to change my shirt after a game of League of Legends because I feel disgusting.  &gt;I'm sure some people will jump in here and bash on what I have to say. I've been as honest as I could possibly be to put this on a public forum. Can you say that you've been as honest with yourselves? Troll all you want, but I'm writing this because I am sick of how terrible people act towards others. We're all peers here. We all all playing a video game to have some fun. Start saying things like ""Don't worry, we'll get them next time."" instead of ""You (explicative) suck!"" when gameplay is going poorly.  &gt;All in all, what I really want to say is, there are real people on the other end of these Summoner name's. Real people just like you. Real people that like being happy more than they are sad. Some of them can't help but get upset because they have less choice in their emotions due to problems that they didn't ask for.  &gt;Thank you for your time.  &gt;EDIT: (copy/paste of my latest post to this thread) Thanks again to everyone that's taken the time out of their night to read and respond. I appreciate everyone's input on what I've had to say. I really didn't think this was going to start up such a discussion!  &gt;I'm going to get off of here for the night. I tried to read and reply as much as I could.  &gt;Much love to everyone.  &gt;I'll check up on the thread either before I go to bed or tomorrow morning.  &gt;Have a good night everyone and I hope you all go 20/0 in your next game. ♥",♥

t5_mouw,TheAmityvillain,1347345449,"**BACKGROUND**: Testicular germ cell tumor (TGCT) incidence increased steadily in recent decades, but causes remain elusive. Germ cell function may be influenced by cannabinoids, and 2 prior epidemiologic studies reported that the use of marijuana may be associated with nonseminomatous TGCT. Here, the authors evaluate the relation between TGCTs and exposure to marijuana and other recreational drugs using a population-based case-control study.  **METHODS**: In total, 163 patients who were diagnosed with TGCT in Los Angeles County from December 1986 to April 1991 were enrolled, and 292 controls were matched on age, race/ethnicity, and neighborhood. Participants were asked about drug use by a structured, in-person interview. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using conditional logistic regression analysis adjusted for history of cryptorchidism; education; religiosity; and reported use of marijuana, cocaine, and amyl nitrite.  **RESULTS**: Compared with never use, ever use of marijuana had a 2-fold increased risk (OR, 1.94; 95% CI, 1.02-3.68), whereas ever use of cocaine had a negative association with TGCT (OR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.32-0.91). Stratification on tumor histology revealed a specific association of marijuana use with nonseminoma and mixed histology tumors (OR, 2.42; 95% CI, 1.08-5.42).  **CONCLUSIONS**: A specific association was observed between marijuana use and the risk of nonseminoma and mixed tumors. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of a negative association between cocaine use and TGCT risk. The current results warrant mechanistic studies of marijuana's effect on the endocannabinoid system and TGCT risk and caution that recreational and therapeutic use of cannabinoids by young men may confer malignant potential to testicular germ cells.

t5_2qhhu,LauraF8,1347374100,"[Birthday Musings at 55]      On the brink of disaster,      Divested of all rank and     External markers of success,      I sit silent as the mute child     I once was,     Owning only the wisdom acquired      By trial, and that too is not a     Tangible possession.      So where is this      Limbo Land?      What is this blank     Mist shrouding the path to the     Phenomenal world?      Again I sit naked on the     Mountain top, but at     55, I do not bleed into the     Earth, I am the Earth,     The sustainer of all life.      Without me nothing     Would exist, and yet     Nothing does exist, For it is all mist.      Not seeking to please or be pleased,     Neither begging nor commanding,     It is as if time has stopped. The taskmaster is done,     Laid off. It’s time to      Enjoy the view, the curious nature of this     Unfathomable mystery.      Isn’t that what a child does?     Explore the present moment without     Expectation?      So it seems that the half circle of 55 is like     Eyes seeing into the future and the past,     Acknowledging that coming full circle     Does not equal death, sadness, loss or     Defeat, nor a new beginning of     Endless striving.      No, this is a realization that the     Ending of the endless cycle is but a     Moment of sitting shrouded in the      Mist, and not needing to see     Beyond it, but      Embracing the mystery of it like a      Child who feels the first snow upon     It’s face, Staring into the open sky.

I had a lot of free time, back then, and managed to get the epic mount a couple of day after reaching level 60 (thank you Major Mana Potion ♥)  I was lucky enough to beat every single raid: Naxxramas was awesome, one of the best raids ever. But it was unfair that it was so difficult to get there only a minority had the chance to see it.  I've never liked Outland, but the raids were amazing and the heroics challenging. Never been to Sunwell Plateau, since I took a break at that point.  I came back for WotLK and did a terrible mistake: rerolled from mage to DK. I've tried every single class in the game and the DK is the most boring.  Revamped Naxxramas sucked, Ulduar was boring and not challneging at all.  Two years later, out of curiosity, I decided to try Cataclysm: if raiding in WotLK made me yawn, Cata made me experience narcolepsy.  I've tried MoP beta and made up my mind: it's time to move on and never touch my account again.  I honestly wish I had the chance to try EvE online back in 2005, instead of WoW.",♥

t5_2u6b3,dtarabishy,1347418409,"I believe the first quote listed, 2-17, is a very famous one. I must say I agree with it. Acknowledging whether you know something or not is very important in the process of learning. If you do not acknowledge that you do not know something, then how can you learn it?  I also find it interesting in quote 7-19 that Confucius states he is not born with the possession of knowledge, just the fondness for it. In Chapter 2 on Human Nature Confucius clearly states that some people are born with knowledge. Is it just me or are some people *cough* (Confucius) contradicting themselves?  Also, since Dr. Bishop said to not hesitate when asking questions, can someone explain quote 12-22 to me? How will the “crooked” be made upright if they are put aside? Who are those considered “crooked”? Are they criminals, people who are mentally ill, who?  On to Dewey, I see that Dewey really believes in applied knowledge. He states that knowledge resides in the consequences of directed action (The Quest for Certainty, p. 196), and then states that knowledge is only valuable when it is effective (Democracy and Education, p. 347) I believe this kind of relates to our general/specific knowledge argument. Aristotle also states a similar idea, that those experiencing are better off than those theorizing.   We also go back to Chapter 2 on Human Nature in the quote from Human Nature and Conduct, p. 177.  Dewey draws the line between habits, impulses, and knowledge. Habits and impulses do not allow for observation and reflection, because we are so accustomed to doing them that we don’t usually stop and think. However, a certain combination of both will allow for observation, memory, and judgment.  If any of you have the answers to my questions please give me your answers and opinions. Thanks ☺ ",☺

t5_2rmaw,thebest99,1347492981,"For some reason the websites security certificate isnt working so ill just post the article here for anyone not wanting to go on the site:  Public Health Advisory from the Director of Force Health Protection On 18 May 2012, a Base Surgeon notified the Directorate Force Health Protection (D FHP) of three cases of rhabdomyolysis requiring hospitalization; one case required dialysis for acute renal failure. Two of three cases reported doing “CrossFit®”, a type of Extreme Conditioning Program (ECP), prior to their diagnosis. The three cases originated from the same base and presented to the medical clinic over a short time period between March and May, 2012.   Exertional rhabdomyolysis (ER) has been reported most commonly in weight lifters, endurance athletes, and military personnel (particularly at the recruit level). It is associated with considerable morbidity in terms of lost duty time, hospitalization, and medical treatment.  Although few studies have examined the burden of this illness in civilian and military populations, a recent descriptive study using hospital and administrative data of the active component of the U.S. Armed Forces found the diagnosis of ER increased by 70 percent from 2006 to 2010. This study noted that personnel were more likely to develop ER if they were male, less than 26 years of age, were African-American, had a length of service of less than 90 days, suffered from a previous heat injury and had not deployed during the study period. (reference A).  As ER can be associated with potentially life threatening complications, a preliminary investigation was initiated to identify other possible cases of rhabdomyolysis in CF personnel to determine the magnitude of the problem. Laboratory reports with an elevated creatine kinase (CK) level of greater than 4,000 U/L from the Canadian Forces Health Information System (CFHIS) were used to identify additional cases. Twenty-one cases were identified between April 2011 and May 2012. Health record review found 18 of these 21 cases had participated in some form of exercise/fitness program, workout, or competition. Documentation in 10 of 18 health records specifically mentioned CrossFit® as a possible risk factor. These numbers likely represent an underestimate of the true incidence of rhabdomyolysis since only the most severe cases were captured (i.e., the cases had a CK value greater than 4,000 U/L, sought medical attention at a CF medical treatment facility and discrete laboratory data is only available at about half of all CFHIS sites).   ECPs, such as CrossFit®, P90x®, and Insanity®, have increased in popularity over the past few years. These programs are characterized by frequent, repetitious, high intensity exercises with very short rest periods between sets/cycles and little recovery time between workouts. Some ECPs do not encourage participants to progressively increase their workloads in an effort to allow for training adaption. CF personnel who participate may not have the requisite knowledge to properly set the required work to rest ratios to offset injury or illnesses possibly associated with ECPs. A disproportionate number of injuries such as muscle strains, sprains, stress fractures and rhabdomyolysis associated with ECPs have been cited in anecdotal reports and case studies, however, few studies have looked at the relationship between ECPs and injuries to date. (reference B)  ECPs are not endorsed by Personnel Support Programs (PSP), Directorate of Fitness (DFIT) or D FHP for reasons noted in para 4. DFIT has reviewed ECPs and has incorporated some of the recognized benefits into their physical fitness programs. To reduce the risk of injuries, DFIT has also developed a Tactical Athlete User Clinic, which educates and trains CF personnel on how to safely perform complex weight lifting techniques commonly found in ECPs (e.g., clean and squat). In addition, two courses (the Basic Fitness Training Assistant (BFTA) and the Advanced Fitness Training Assistant (AFTA)) are offered to CF personnel who are interested in leading safe and effective unit physical training. Local PSP fitness personnel are also available to provide information and guidance on safe training principles and other conditioning programs that incorporate accepted training doctrine.  Based on the results of this initial investigation, it is recommended that patients presenting with muscle pain and/or weakness, swelling, limited range of motion or tea coloured urine be asked about the type, amount and start date of any recent strenuous physical activity including engaging in ECPs, such as CrossFit®. In patients presenting without the cardinal sign of tea coloured urine, a differential diagnosis of ER should still be considered if they have a history of recent intense physical activity (including CrossFit®), especially in patients reporting a sudden increase in activity. Appropriate diagnostic blood work, including serum CK, should be drawn. (reference C and D).  It is recommended that patients be counselled regarding the dangers of ECPs and that they are informed of mitigating factors that can help prevent ER (e.g., gradual training progression, adequate hydration, appropriate rest periods, factoring in the effects of heat and humidity, and individualized training) for preventing ER. Patients should also be referred to their local PSP fitness personnel for guidance on safe and effective fitness training. (reference B, E and F)  CF Health Services Group will continue to gather more detailed information on current ER cases.  New cases should be reported to D FHP by email at +DFHP Iinquiries@CMP DGHS@Ottawa-hull.",®

"" Parking spot  A few weeks ago, some guy in a shitty bmw parked in my 'reserved and paid for' parking spot in a small lot. I printed out an A4 (helvetica demi bold 12pt) note stating that this was a paid for parking spot and not to park there again. A couple of days later he parked there again. I printed out an A3 (helvetica black 42pt) sign stating 'Reserved Parking, Do not park here' sign and used spray adhesive (3M®) to mount it on the wall in front of my spot. When I went to park in my spot the next day he had written in texta, after ""Reserved Parking', the words 'For Wankers'. About three days later I saw his car parked in the street so I printed out a poster in A2 (helvetica black, 92pt, reversed) with the word 'Fuckhead' and applied it with spray adhesive to his windscreen, ensuring (as per instructions) I sprayed both materials to be bonded. The disadvantage of course is that I am too scared to park in my spot but he is also too scared to park there so I will class this as a draw for the moment and find a new spot. """,®

t5_2qh1i,5HAK,1347530464,"&gt; A few weeks ago, some guy in a shitty bmw parked in my 'reserved and paid for' parking spot in a small lot. I printed out an A4 (helvetica demi bold 12pt) note stating that this was a paid for parking spot and not to park there again. A couple of days later he parked there again. I printed out an A3 (helvetica black 42pt) sign stating 'Reserved Parking, Do not park here' sign and used spray adhesive (3M®) to mount it on the wall in front of my spot. When I went to park in my spot the next day he had written in texta, after ""Reserved Parking', the words 'For Wankers'. About three days later I saw his car parked in the street so I printed out a poster in A2 (helvetica black, 92pt, reversed) with the word 'Fuckhead' and applied it with spray adhesive to his windscreen, ensuring (as per instructions) I sprayed both materials to be bonded. The disadvantage of course is that I am too scared to park in my spot but he is also too scared to park there so I will class this as a draw for the moment and find a new spot.  27bslash6.com",®

t5_2rfxx,Maraudingcaptain,1347561667,"For those at work:  NA Regionals were last week. Coming into the event, what were your expectations?   Chauster: I expected to finish top 3. I was feeling pretty confident coming into the tournament because I feel like the North American scene is among the weakest in the competitive scene right now and we had improved a good amount.     How did it compare to past events such as MLG and IPL?   Chauster: The venue was pretty amazing. The design and the ambience made it feel like it was a huge event, which for League of Legends players it was. Riot also treated all the players well and provided a night of fun at the arcade so we were all taken care of.   You beat Legion in your first round 2-1 pulling out a mass TP strategy in games 1 and 2. What was the reasoning behind this?   Chauster: Most people think it is stupid to show your strategies in the first round of the tournament. However, since the NA regionals were single elimination we could not afford to lose in the first round, so we used our strategy we crafted in Korea. The strategy is pretty simple and revolves around split pushing. After laning phase the team with the teleports just have to group up and push 1 or 2 lanes while the promote minion secretly pushes another lane.This produces pressure on all 3 lanes. Teams will have to send at least one person to each lane to deal with the threat or lose free objectives. They will have to respond, and when that happens, my team can at any point collapse on one single point (a tower or Baron) and force an objective. You rinse and repeat this over and over and eventually you just win the game from securing free objectives    Coming into the games vs Team Dignitas, were you confident in a win? How did you think the games were going to play out?   Chauster: I was not confident because historically my team has a problem playing against Dignitas. Their playstyle somewhat counters ours and as a result we have a tougher time facing them. I thought the series was going to be close and go 2-1 to either team.     After losing 2-0 to Dignitas, what was going through your mind after that 76 minute game?   Chauster: I didn't really think about too many things other than the fact that if we lost the game versus Curse the next day we would be in deep shit. I know that if Dignitas played the game correctly, we would have had no chance to come back into the game. However, Dignitas threw the game and let us get a baron and gave us complete control of the game. However, we tossed the game back into the hands of Dignitas with horrible decision making and ultimately did not deserve to win.     What went wrong in those matches?   Chauster: The first game every lane did well except top lane, and it snowballed very hard. Originally we picked Vladmir to outscale Irelia and it is pretty much an impossibility to lose lane with jungle Shen pressure. Voyboy managed to lose lane with this and we did not have an exhaust to deal with the fed Irelia. This made team fights very hard even though we outcomped them so heavily and we just lost the game.  Second game they caught us off guard with their poke comp and we did not have a hard initiate. As a result they played it out well in the beginning but ended up giving us a chance to win the game. The biggest mistake I remember is Doublelift getting too greedy and dying in Dignitas' base when the inhibitors were up. We could have taken 2 inhibitors and snowballed the game to the end but we failed when he died randomly.     How did you feel knowing you would be facing Curse in the third place match with so much history between them and yourselves?   Chauster: I felt pretty confident because we know how Saint plays and we know that our team does very well against Curse's set of players. We were given enough information from the previous rounds of the tournament to also not run into anything unexpected so we were able to predict and prepare for most outcomes.     After winning against Curse 2-0 to secure your spot in the S2 final next month, what emotions were you going through?   Chauster: I was relieved that we did not have to go home losers. CLG has been losing popularity in recent months because of our stint in Korea and a loss at Regionals would have sealed our fate as a mediocre team that has fallen from grace. Now we are still known as one of the top teams in NA and have another chance to redeem ourselves.     If you could go back and give yourself/teammates advise coming into the regionals, what would it be?   Chauster: Suck your pride up and only play champions you know you can play. Don't waste time playing things outside of your comfort zone, chances are you will never be good enough doing it anyways.     You are now going to live in a gaming house with CLG.NA and CLG.EU to prepare for the S2 finals, will you be exclusivly scrimming each other, or do you plan to scrim other teams too?   Chauster: We plan on scrimming other teams too. Scrimming exclusively against one team has a lot of downsides.     Can we expect more crazy strategies being prepared in this time?   Chauster: Perhaps. We will see come S2 Finals.     What are your predictions for the S2 Finals?   Chauster: I don't really have many predictions because there are too many teams and any team can beat another team on any given day at the finals.   What’s the future like for CLG.NA after S2 finals are done with?   Chauster: After S2 finals are done with we will have to sit down and talk about our plans for S3. We need to solidify our roster and recruit subs in case any of us can't make events or starts underperforming. I am sure everyone will go home after S2 finals are done also for a small vacation.     Any shoutouts?   Chauster: Shoutout to CLG sponsors Razer, own3d, and XMG. You can follow me at my non-twitter at facebook/LoLChauster or come into my channel on IRC @ #chauster.

t5_2qh2u,taro-topor,1347602045,"&gt;1.) Will getting around crowded subway stations and trains be problematic?  ""Problematic?"" Yep. Suck it up.  In my 25+ years of daily commuting around Tokyo on crutches and leg braces, I have been offered the Priority Seats for the handicapped fewer than 25 times.   Most but **not all** stations in Kanto the greater Tokyo area have an elevator or escalator. If you get turned around and use the wrong exit (Tokyo's Shinjuku station has more than 200 exits) you can find yourself ""trapped"" in an underground corridor with a several changes of grade that require to go up and down several flights of stairs. The corridors linking Tokyo station with Otemachi station seem to be the worst.  Another nasty example of piss-poor accessibility is at Tokyo's Shibuya station, one of the top 10 busiest in Japan. The terminus of Ginza Line does NOT have either an elevator or escalator and the narrow stairs are not level with steps sloped downward.    You can try to plan your Tokyo Metro trips using this resource:   http://www.tokyometro.jp/safety/barrierfree/progress/index.html (in Japanese)  Or, giga-goofy [Google Translate] (http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;layout=2&amp;eotf=1&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.tokyometro.jp%2Fsafety%2Fbarrierfree%2Fprogress%2Findex.html)    Station and Terminal Accessibility Information (piss poor but in eng*r*ish) http://www.ecomo-rakuraku.jp/rakuraku/index?nextpage=TerminalSelectE.html  Odekake-net (in Japanese) This site gives you crappy access info for each railway station. http://www.ecomo-rakuraku.jp/rakuraku/index/    Accessible Japan Travel Guide     http://www.tesco-premium.co.jp/aj/ui/uiall.htm    Total rubbish -- Printed ""town maps"" for the disabled (in Japanese) issued by local autonomies or other organizations.   http://accessible.jp.org/tokyo/en/useful/map.html       &gt;there used to be a significant social stigma attached to handicapped people.  Yeah, about that... Your being a gaijin/alien is more troubling to the Japanese than your handicap.  That said, about once a week a braindead salaryman will smash into me knocking me down--sometimes dramatically down a flight of stairs or into the gap between the train and platform. I seldom get an apology since the always scurry away like the どぶねずみ-*dobu nezumi* that they are. Get travel insurance for your air medevac. ;-)   BOTTOM LINE: With patience, planning, a good smile and thick skin, Tokyo can be a great adventure for you.    ________________sadly-still-true report______________________   Tokyo: Inaccessible Shibuya and Shinjuku Train Stations   By Darren Campeau © 2008 http://www.globalaccessnews.com/tokyo%20subway%2008.htm   My wife, a Japanese national, and I just returned from Tokyo, where we had a nice trip most of the time, but often thought of a disabled friend's daily plight as we attempted to wheel our 10-month-old baby around Tokyo in her stroller.... .... 'struggle' is the key phrase I would use when describing the mish-mash layouts of the complicated train and subway stations. Some private train lines (serving the suburban areas) had elevators at most stations, but when connecting to the main stations (in our case Shibuya and Shinjuku) to transfer to the major train system (run by the government's Japan Rail) the grapple began. Dealing with an 18lb child, 12lb stroller and a few shopping bags isn't a severe hardship for two people to carry on stairs, but it would be an impossible experience for anyone dependent on a continuous system of ramps and elevators. If you go out the wrong exit point (and there's always many to chose from), you can be faced with twenty or thirty stairs (no other options) and an endless mega-swarm of people chaotically headed in all directions. You would have to buy another ticket to get back into the station gate and find the correct hodge-podge path to elevator your way out (then you'd have to explain why you supposedly didn't use the ticket). It was frequent that we found ourselves taking an elevator from the train platform to another level's platform to then crossover to another platform, walk to the other end to catch another elevator to get to the station level. And that's not necessarily street level. Often we'd connect to a department store basement and use the store's elevators and hope that we could exit the store without needing to step down to the street.   Another interesting aspect to all of this is that no one of authority, i.e., station agents, info booth attendants, and elevator girls really seemed to be sure if any path would be a continuous roll. And often their information was wrong or included a flight of stairs.",©

t5_2r8lo,jetonator,1347633665,"I think having voiced protagonists if Bioware was going for an Origins-style character would be difficult (not to mention expensive) since elves and humans and dwarves have different accents so I wouldn't mind only having a human player available. They're easier to relate to too. But I would enjoy the ability to choose some brief aspects about the protagonist's background much like the system in ME, with characters reacting differently to you based on that.  I'd like to see Hawke being mentioned in passing much like the Warden is in DA2. Better yet, a full cameo if you import -- since Bioware bothered to divide Hawke's personality into 3 distinct branches I think it wouldn't be too hard to have three versions of a Hawke character appear in DA3 (with your custom face and everything too!). I'm thinking maybe as a companion, or at least a supporting character. I mean they must have left the ending of DA2 open for a reason.  I know quite a few people who want Morrigan's kid to appear in DA3 but let's not forget that some people (me) sacrificed their Warden in DA:O and imported that save into DA2. If the kid appears at all I don't think it should be a major part of the storyline...  Well-developed, strong companions with elaborate backstories are a must. That was one of the things I really loved about DA2. It had its failings with its general plotline as a whole but I think the romance/friendship subplots were well done. I'd like to see something like that, combined with the epic, traditional fantasy feel of the story of DA:O.  None of these really have to do with the gameplay, lol... But it's not really my place to say anything about the gameplay since I play the game mostly for the story. I didn't even notice any major gameplay flaws of DA2 until I read the bad reviews (✌ﾟ∀ﾟ)☞ Go me.",✌

""Grand Valley Metropolitan Council's Mobile Pavement Management System (PaMS), a new advanced technology tool to gather data on pavement conditions and help local and state officials make better decisions about road repairs and reconstruction is now in service n the Grand Rapids metropolitan area.  The GVMC PaMS is a full-size Ford® van equipped with state-of-the-art electronic pavement scanners, high-resolution still cameras, Global Positioning System (GPS) components and computers. Operated by experienced transportation planners from GVMC's Transportation Department, the equipment will be used throughout the GVMC transportation study area to ascertain pavement conditions and enable local road agencies and the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) to better manage roads, bridges and other elements of our region's surface transportation network.  It marks the first time that the mobile, semi-automated, advanced technology system will be used to gather and analyze road condition data in Michigan.  “This is a major step forward for our collaborative transportation planning efforts in the Grand Rapids metro area,” said Metro Council Chairman James Buck, Mayor of Grandville. “Once again, Metro Council is collaborating to share costs and employ the most-advanced technology, to benefit taxpayers and the motoring public in the Grand Rapids metropolitan region.”  During the construction season (April through November), GVMC's distinctive PaMS vehicle will travel the freeways and surface streets in the Grand Rapids metropolitan area, scanning and photographing pavement and other road and bridge infrastructure and storing the data for later analysis by GVMC transportation planners. While the van is being operated at normal road speeds, lasers scan the road surface to ascertain pavement conditions and GPS technology pinpoints the location of pavement deficiencies and adjacent transportation infrastructure. High-speed still cameras inventory and catalogue pavement conditions, together with road and bridge infrastructure (traffic signals, signs, street lamps, guard rails, etc.), and store the data and photographic images on high-capacity disk drives.  GVMC transportation planners and engineers then analyze the data and collaborate with public works officials and engineers from area cities and villages, the Kent and Ottawa County Road Commissions and MDOT to ascertain pavement conditions, catalogue deficiencies and prioritize road and bridge improvement projects.  “At a time when local taxpayers and motorists are rightly demanding that local officials collaborate and use more efficient methods for delivering critical services, GVMC has stepped up to meet that demand,” said GVMC Vice Chairman Don R. Hilton, Sr., Supervisor of Gaines Charter Township. “By putting state-of-the-art technology in the hands of experienced transportation planning professionals, and collaborating to share the costs, we're ensuring that the taxpayers' investments are wisely managed.”",®

t5_2qh9a,gouchout,1347658819,"Certainly there's a strong smell of hypocrisy about the list. A lot of the countries do business with the US &amp; UK or have military links. In the UK,for example, a huge fraud case involving the infamous Thatcher-era Al Yamamah arms deal with the Saudis &amp; bribery was unlawfully(© High Court of Justice) stopped by the just-as-infamous Blair government. The UK &amp; US have certainly contributed to if not directly created the situation in many on the list.  Even Iran - when the popular *secular* government kicked the UK out &amp; nationalised the oil industry the UK persuaded Eisenhower that the pro-USSR communists in the coalition were going to take over eventually, so the CIA funded &amp; created a coup d'etat, &amp; handed power to the Shah, which they supported despite his horrible repression until the Iranians had had enough in 1979 &amp; lo! and behold...they got an extreme theocracy instead.  Now we're reaping the crop that was sown when when we supported the all other scumbags in the Middle East, now they're passing their use-by date.  The Cold War was always a shit excuse, especially when anyone to the left of Pinochet was considered a *commie* or at least a *pinko* (there's a slur you don't hear much  now - I don't think the US right can conceive of anything left of centre any more)) so that all the guys who would've made up a political class fled abroad as the horrible UK or US(or USSR) sponsored government tightened its grip.

t5_2qhqb,kenny-rogers,1347659842,"Consider the Duggan event last year, who could have predicted the animosity towards police that broke out? The film itself is obvious muslim baiting, and being published on youtube in July, having been made 12 months previously, why now is a great question. [Some are suggesting it was an organised revenge assassination attack](http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4280821,00.html). Who even came up with the narrative that this was about the film? What is the evidence?  I don't really see it as an explosion though. It's not really that significant in terms of violence, but it's a big deal because of the target and made a big deal by the press and military because that's what they do. Some reported that dead bodies were dragged through the streets to add more humiliation, but [actually they were dragged away from the fire and then to a hospital where the ambassador died of smoke inhalation](http://www.pbs.org/mediashift/2012/09/how-sam-bacile-bamboozled-the-ap-wall-street-journal-over-anti-muslim-film258.html). The ""enemy"" must be made to look as bad as possible to legitimise any force against them, or legitimise the expansion of empire. More people including nine children were killed by that [""one"" rogue US soldier terrorist](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/mar/19/afghanistan-american-imperialism-glenn-greenwald?utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter) for example, a death toll far higher than all these embassy ""riots"" as so far as I can make out.  It's almost impossible to pick this apart, but it is clear that the most significant uprisings have been around the middle eastern countries that have seen US/NATO aggression in recent times. Far eastern islamic states, or even middle eastern ""friendly"" islamic states like Saudi Arabia and Bahrain haven't made the headlines. The old wisdom is to ask who benefits? But it's unclear because there are so many players.  **""Common"" muslims** - they rarely benefit from violence, however there has been so much directed at them for many years now it is understandable that they would be resentful. It could be spontaneous insurrections or deliberately herded and directed by others.  &gt; [Predators launched 145 strikes on ex-regime targets. That was twice the barrage drones unleashed in all of 2011 on tribal Pakistan, the place commonly thought of as the epicenter of U.S. drone strikes.](http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/332810)  If people hate the film so much why haven't they gone after israeli embassies especially since Sam Bacile was on record as   **""Extreme"" muslims** - the most extreme muslims in Libya were the same ones that the west supported, so why should we be surprised when violence reoccurs? These people might use this as an excuse to further the ""brotherhood"" and gain political power, but it would seem odd to bite the hand that was feeding just a few months earlier. Have we seen this before? Western militaries know exactly what happens when you back extremists, Afghanistan is the example. You fracture a country, the same is happening in Syria.  **US military** - the Libyan response has been extreme, Obama® has moved warships and marines into the region. In fact they have proposed sending more ""security"" to all embassies around the world in ""counter terrorism"" measures. It certainly seems like an invasion by another name.  **Israel** - Obama® has quite publicly rebuffed Netanyahu's demands for war agains Iran. Like the US government has used [false flag strategies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Northwoods), [Israel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavon_Affair) (if we can even say it is separate) has a history of them as well. The film was obviously a propaganda film to incite hatred, but if so why not all muslim countries not just Libya? Obviously once the libya thing happened people got brave and it spread, even to the UK. I read I think a likudnik essay from the 70s or 80s about who the military strategy to advance israeli interests should revolve around destabilising neighbours through the provocation of sectarian violence. There was an attempt to frame Israel with the fake ""Sam Bacile"", fake quotes of calling islam caner, and probably fake jewish financiers.  So who knows? My best guess is that this is a media primed to make muslims look as bad as possible, deliberately distract from decades of aggression by UK/US/Israel as a contributing factor, and then like with 9/11, the military industrial complex has started to milk it for all its worth to expand the ""war on terror"". The PNAC essay [Rebuilding America's Defenses](http://www.newamericancentury.org/RebuildingAmericasDefenses.pdf) is one that gives insight into the current military aims of the US and Israel.  &gt; [Further, the process of transformation, even if it brings revolutionary change, is likely to be a long one, absent some catastrophic and catalyzing event – like a new Pearl Harbor.](http://www.newamericancentury.org/RebuildingAmericasDefenses.pdf) *[link fixed]**  I wish I could revisit the other one.

t5_2qhpn,keraneuology,1347667882,"&gt; There is a ton of supply that people aren't buying despite all-time low mortgage rates.  Where is it?  From the National Association of Realtors  &gt; WASHINGTON (April 26, 2012) – Pending home sales increased in March and are well above a year ago, another signal the housing market is recovering, according to the National Association of Realtors®.  &gt; The Pending Home Sales Index,* a forward-looking indicator based on contract signings, rose 4.1 percent to 101.4 in March from an upwardly revised 97.4 in February and is 12.8 percent above March 2011 when it was 89.9.  The data reflects contracts but not closings.  &gt; The index is now at the highest level since April 2010 when it reached 111.3.  &gt; Lawrence Yun, NAR chief economist, said 2012 is expected to be a year of recovery for housing.  “First quarter sales closings were the highest first quarter sales in five years.  The latest contract signing activity suggests the second quarter will be equally good,” he said.  &gt; “The housing market has clearly turned the corner.  **Rising sales are bringing down inventory** and creating much more balanced conditions around the county, which means home prices will be rising in more areas as the year progresses,” Yun said.   And more recently  &gt; WASHINGTON (August 29, 2012) - Pending home sales rose in July to the highest level in over two years and remain well above year-ago levels, according to the National Association of Realtors®.  &gt; The Pending Home Sales Index,* a forward-looking indicator based on contract signings, rose 2.4 percent to 101.7 in July from 99.3 in June and is 12.4 percent above July 2011 when it was 90.5. The data reflect contracts but not closings.  &gt; Lawrence Yun , NAR chief economist, said the index is at the highest level since April 2010, which was shortly before the closing deadline for the home buyer tax credit. ""While the month-to-month movement has been uneven, more importantly we now have 15 consecutive months of year-over-year gains in contract activity,"" Yun said.  &gt; **Limited inventory is constraining market activity.** ""All regions saw monthly increases in home-buying activity except for the West, which is now experiencing an **acute inventory shortage**,"" Yun added.  Inventory is tight and getting tighter.  Low value properties are quickly scarfed up by investors, high end properties often spark bidding wars and there just aren't as many homes in the middle as there are buyers these days.  Prices have been slowly increasing for a couple of years now and foreclosures are down.  Now it *feels* like you are right.  It *feels* like there is some major economic problems coming but I can't see anything to justify what my gut is telling me.  Most of the signs are positive and people have been warning about some major collapse that has been ""imminent"" for a couple of years now.",®

Thus, anybody who wants to take offence will be able to do so. And while this may even be legitimate, it's hardly constructive.  In my mind, inducing an agenda of male supremacy over females to an audience consisting of mostly SAPs of theoretical computer scientists seems a bit paranoid, especially when done by singling out the ambigous use of the word 'attractive'.   And because listeners are the sovereign of their own interpretations, discussion is limited to progress constructively only in the intersection of all (and particularly of adversarial) interpretations. So unless we can be brought to agree on the basic premises of the issue, we're basically limited to throwing mud.  In this case I see no common ground between my own opinion and the OP's, as I happened to interpret Swierstra's comment exclusively as a light-hearted phrasing of the observation that ♀s from a math background seem to prefer functional programming languages over imperative ones, and that there might be a point in promoting that. If the phrasing carried any emotional load, I would interpret it as mildly desparate and ironic, as the gender gap in CS is (in my mind) a detriment to the field, and I percieve that most other people involved feel the same way too.  (replace ♀ with whatever word indicating a subject of an individual of the Homo Sapiens (sapiens) species that happens to have two X chromosomes. Preferably one that does not offend you, for the sake of constructive dialogue)   **tl;dr:** While you're entitled to your opinion, I reserve the right to politely disagree.",♀

t5_2sfmf,blakerboy777,1347824600,"That's a good point. I guess I think of tax breaks and tax increases I fundamentally different ways. Tax increases should always be for the purpose of increasing revenue. In my mind that is the only moral purpose of a tax; otherwise it is a subtle and insidious attempt to control the economy rather than a forthright law. Tax incentives are, in my opinion, an attempt to increase revenue by increase the flow of money. Its all an attempt to find the place on the Laffer curve where revenue will be maximized. Until we get to the point where our debt is paid down and revenue exceeds spending, we will always be trying to increase revenues.   Increasing taxes in order to discourage certain types of investment is an aspect of central planning. Tax breaks can be used in the same way, and I don't think that's any more defensible. I would rather see the FairTax© passed and not have the government have the kind of influence it has on our economy. I think the housing bubble is an example of how this fails. The government tried to incentivise (sic) homeownership, which led to the financial crisis at the end of Bush's presidency. If the government concerned itself primarily with fairly aggregating revenue rather than using every source of revenue as a chance to pick winners and losers, I think our government would be in a lot better shape.

t5_2fwo,rwbarton,1347837303,"&gt; You're the one with the old ghc, this is 7.4, which started using unicode for FilePath.  Oh, I see.  Actually 7.0.4 only got this right by accident; it is effectively reading the filename as latin1 and printing it as UTF-8.  If I create a file with a UTF-8 encoded name, I get `balderdashÃ©`.  7.4 assumes filenames are UTF-8 and translates the invalid trailing `e9` byte as U+DCE9, which it then can't print out because it's not a Unicode character.  But I can pass the String with this weird character from getDirectoryContents back to writeFile and that works fine.  Your program is trying to print a non-Unicode string (the name of the file) to a Unicode terminal, so it fails.  When the filename really is UTF-8, 7.4 does the right thing.  Edit: Oh I see from your comments elsewhere you already know how GHC works in this area.  It is pretty awkward to have an interface that pretends filenames are UTF-8 on a system where are semantically just strings of bytes.  &gt; Also you didn't create the same filename, it's supposed to be invalid utf-8:  I used the same command to create it.  You can see the output of my ls command is not valid UTF-8; it contains e9 followed by 0a.  Whereas yours contains only ASCII characters... I guess your version of ls prints an escape sequence in this situation.",©

Things happen in the nooks and crannies of our respective environments that we just can't see, even in the light of day--let alone at night and twilit morning, when most of us are sleeping anyway.  So one (pre-)morning, I was just sitting down to my daily breakfast at the time (three Thomas'® Corn Toast•R•Cakes and a glass of milk) and sitting in my usual spot at the table, which was next to one of the kitchen's floor vents. I heard a scuffling noise; I turned to look, and I saw a pair of beady little eyes staring up at me in both surprise and menace. Since that time, I've heard creatures scampering behind the walls of my house and seen birds fly in and out of my attic.   So hey, it's not an entirely crazy notion.",®

Only thing about them that is sad is that they didn't make their title 'Jacking Off in Public' despite me getting 300 votes for it. Hasselhoff is good too though!  Rezonate - First seen in 004, holy shit, I LOVED PUMP IT! Really good Electro song that is #2 on my list compared to the irreplaceable Bad Pitched in my heart. His next song, Lights is fucking amazing, I love how it builds up from very subtle notes and a quiet melody progressing into this kick ass electro beat. 008's Revolt with Amelia Rose, like TwoThird's 007 Waking Dreams, was a very relaxing song with female vocals (which I fucking adore) and as an added bonus, came with a great dubstep part in the middle.  Rogue - Newer addition to Monstercat. I believe he's a friend of Tristam's. Sounded very skrillexy with his first track in 006, This is it, but was ok nonetheless. Daybreak and Dynamite in 008 made his skrilly sound (the vocal manipulation yet again) a signature sound like Insan3Lik3. It is evident again in Nightfall. Overall, if you don't like that vocal manipulation shit, don't listen to him, but his stuff's pretty tight.  Rundfunk - New to the family, song in 009 was amazing nu disco. At this rate, Monstercat needs a new colour for this genre haha. Can't just be classified as EDM anymore :P  Skifonix - Only heard in 008. Their song, People Say is an energetic electro song which was actually mixed extremely well into the album mix. Once again, female vocals ♥_♥.  Soulero - Didn't listen to his song Pussycat in depth enough to have an opinion on it, but from a first hear, it sounds good, check it out.  Stephen Walking - Original member of Monstercat. I loved his song Still Walking in 001 for the intro prior to the drop due to its subbass and subtlety, but his songs from 002 - 006 really didn't interest me. His drumstep afterwards kind of got me back into him, but overall, I don't like his style. It's all opinions here, maybe you'll love him. Check him out regardless of my opinion.",♥

t5_2qi6d,adroc,1347849406,"Works fine for me. But here it is if you cant read it.  Jon Yates' ""What's Your Problem?"" September 16, 2012  Parking along the 0-100 block of West Randolph Street isn't cheap.  From 8 a.m. to 9 p.m., it costs $5.75 an hour; overnight parking costs about half that amount.  At those rates, parking along the street for 24 hours would set you back a hefty $106.38.  For months, the 26-year-old has been parking her motorcycle in what you might call Loop loopholes — small patches of downtown streets that are neither covered by the seemingly omnipresent meters nor marked as restricted.  In other words, Targos has found slivers of space where she can legally park her 1996 Honda VT 600 for free.  The free spots are widely known by fellow motorcycle riders who park in them daily, Targos said. Some of the spots, like the ones on Randolph, are large enough to fit a car.  In most cases the city does not bat an eye.  But for reasons she can't fathom, Chicago police have begun aggressively ticketing her motorcycle when she parks it along West Randolph.  Since June 3, Targos has received 38 parking tickets for a variety of alleged infractions, including parking ""not entirely in a parking meter space,"" parking in a prohibited zone, and having an expired meter in the central business district.  Targos insists the tickets are bogus, and has challenged all 38 by mail.  So far, administrative law judges agree.  Through Friday, 14 of the tickets have been adjudicated, and Targos maintains a perfect record — all 14 were dismissed.  Rulings on the other 24 tickets are pending, but Targos expects those to be thrown out too.  ""I've read the ordinance. I know the ordinance so freaking well,"" she said. ""Not one (of the tickets) has been found valid by an administrative judge.""  And yet, the citations keep coming.  In an attempt to stop the tickets, Targos has taped copies of the judges' rulings on her motorcycle, hoping officers will read it and see that she is legally parked. Instead, officers continue to write fresh tickets, affixing them to her rearview mirror.  At times, the situation has gotten testy.  In early September, Targos was parking her motorcycle when two officers approached and said she couldn't park there, she said. Targos showed them copies of the judges' rulings, but the conversation quickly devolved, she said.  ""They were saying, 'You have to pay to park, you have to pay to park,'"" Targos said. ""I kept saying, 'According to these signs, I don't.'"" Targos said she walked away to avoid further confrontation. ""I got two tickets that day.""  She emailed What's Your Problem? Sept. 6, after receiving three tickets within 24 hours.  ""I keep parking there on principle because I don't want the officers to bully me out of parking in a legal spot,"" she said.  Targos, who lives in the Loop, said she called her alderman, Brendan Reilly, 42nd, whose office instructed her to file a complaint with the Independent Police Review Authority. She eventually filed two complaints, but they did not stop the flow of tickets.  The Problem Solver met Targos on West Randolph Street, and she gave a tour of the block and the signage. Initially, she said, she parked on the south side of Randolph near Dearborn Street, along a stretch that is not covered by any parking restrictions. A sign about 50 feet east of Dearborn says ""pay for parking at pay box"" with an arrow pointing east. There are no signs restricting parking west of the sign, where she parked.  After she started receiving tickets at that location, she began parking on the east end of that block, in a smaller stretch of similarly unmarked curb space. The tickets continued there as well.  Targos said that elsewhere in the Loop, the city has prohibited free parking by adding a second sign to each signpost saying parking is prohibited in the unmetered stretches. In fact, such a sign is posted on the north side of Randolph, directly across the street.  But without any signs indicating parking is restricted or metered, Targos says she is breaking no law.  ""If you walk around downtown, you'll see there are secret little motorcycle spots all over the place,"" she said. ""If they do move those signs, that's fine. There are plenty of other places.""  Targos said she wants the remaining 24 tickets dismissed and for officers to stop issuing new ones.  The Problem Solver called the Police Department and the city's Department of Revenue.  A Revenue Department spokeswoman referred questions to police. Police spokeswoman Melissa Stratton said the department visited the area where Targos has been parking and toured the business district.  ""It's a larger issue in general,"" Stratton said. ""It's not a cut-and-dried thing.""  She said officers are doing the best they can to enforce parking ordinances and signs.  ""We're looking into it to get a better sense of the issue that exists,"" Stratton said.  She said she could not comment on the complaints Targos filed with the Independent Police Review Authority, citing the ongoing investigation.  Targos called the police department's response disappointing.  ""I wonder how many other people are out there getting frivolous tickets?"" she said. ""I have shown these officers personally that these are wrong, but they keep issuing the tickets. Are there no consequences?""  Targos said she will continue to park in the ""free"" spots and plans to challenge tickets she receives.  ""If it's an illegal spot then mark it properly,"" she said.  facebook.com/chitribproblem  Twitter @wyp_tribune  Copyright © 2012, Chicago Tribune",©

In most cases the city does not bat an eye. But for reasons she can't fathom, Chicago police have begun aggressively ticketing her motorcycle when she parks it along West Randolph. Since June 3, Targos has received 38 parking tickets for a variety of alleged infractions, including parking ""not entirely in a parking meter space,"" parking in a prohibited zone, and having an expired meter in the central business district. Targos insists the tickets are bogus, and has challenged all 38 by mail. So far, administrative law judges agree. Through Friday, 14 of the tickets have been adjudicated, and Targos maintains a perfect record — all 14 were dismissed. Rulings on the other 24 tickets are pending, but Targos expects those to be thrown out too. ""I've read the ordinance. I know the ordinance so freaking well,"" she said. ""Not one (of the tickets) has been found valid by an administrative judge."" And yet, the citations keep coming. In an attempt to stop the tickets, Targos has taped copies of the judges' rulings on her motorcycle, hoping officers will read it and see that she is legally parked. Instead, officers continue to write fresh tickets, affixing them to her rearview mirror. At times, the situation has gotten testy. In early September, Targos was parking her motorcycle when two officers approached and said she couldn't park there, she said. Targos showed them copies of the judges' rulings, but the conversation quickly devolved, she said. ""They were saying, 'You have to pay to park, you have to pay to park,'"" Targos said. ""I kept saying, 'According to these signs, I don't.'"" Targos said she walked away to avoid further confrontation. ""I got two tickets that day."" She emailed What's Your Problem? Sept. 6, after receiving three tickets within 24 hours. ""I keep parking there on principle because I don't want the officers to bully me out of parking in a legal spot,"" she said. Targos, who lives in the Loop, said she called her alderman, Brendan Reilly, 42nd, whose office instructed her to file a complaint with the Independent Police Review Authority. She eventually filed two complaints, but they did not stop the flow of tickets. The Problem Solver met Targos on West Randolph Street, and she gave a tour of the block and the signage. Initially, she said, she parked on the south side of Randolph near Dearborn Street, along a stretch that is not covered by any parking restrictions. A sign about 50 feet east of Dearborn says ""pay for parking at pay box"" with an arrow pointing east. There are no signs restricting parking west of the sign, where she parked. After she started receiving tickets at that location, she began parking on the east end of that block, in a smaller stretch of similarly unmarked curb space. The tickets continued there as well. Targos said that elsewhere in the Loop, the city has prohibited free parking by adding a second sign to each signpost saying parking is prohibited in the unmetered stretches. In fact, such a sign is posted on the north side of Randolph, directly across the street. But without any signs indicating parking is restricted or metered, Targos says she is breaking no law. ""If you walk around downtown, you'll see there are secret little motorcycle spots all over the place,"" she said. ""If they do move those signs, that's fine. There are plenty of other places."" Targos said she wants the remaining 24 tickets dismissed and for officers to stop issuing new ones. The Problem Solver called the Police Department and the city's Department of Revenue. A Revenue Department spokeswoman referred questions to police. Police spokeswoman Melissa Stratton said the department visited the area where Targos has been parking and toured the business district. ""It's a larger issue in general,"" Stratton said. ""It's not a cut-and-dried thing."" She said officers are doing the best they can to enforce parking ordinances and signs. ""We're looking into it to get a better sense of the issue that exists,"" Stratton said. She said she could not comment on the complaints Targos filed with the Independent Police Review Authority, citing the ongoing investigation. Targos called the police department's response disappointing. ""I wonder how many other people are out there getting frivolous tickets?"" she said. ""I have shown these officers personally that these are wrong, but they keep issuing the tickets. Are there no consequences?"" Targos said she will continue to park in the ""free"" spots and plans to challenge tickets she receives. ""If it's an illegal spot then mark it properly,"" she said. facebook.com/chitribproblem Twitter @wyp_tribune Copyright © 2012, Chicago Tribune",©

t5_2sfmf,blakerboy777,1347859409,"&gt;That doesn't sound like a moral consideration, but a practical one. Either way, that glosses over quite a lot and doesn't tell us much about how we should structure our taxes. You should be able to change the tax structure quite a bit while remaining revenue neutral.  I'm talking about purpose. If your purpose is to control the economy, even if the side effect is increased revenue, its a bad law, IMHO. We don't need central planning, democracy is all about the decentralization of power.   &gt;&gt; Increasing taxes in order to discourage certain types of investment is an aspect of central planning. Tax breaks can be used in the same way, and I don't think that's any more defensible. I would rather see the FairTax© passed...  &gt;It's still basically ""central planning"". You're just discouraging purchases and possibly investment, and probably encouraging money hoarding. Not that I'm dismissing the idea, but it still influences the economy. You're not going to see a tax plan that doesn't influence the economy.  It does influence the economy, but it doesn't specifically favor one party over another. It treats everyone equally. If no one is ever given a tax holiday, then hoarding is pointless. What's the point in being rich if you never spend your money? Its revenue neutral, so no particular party should experience an increased tax burden. Its not like they'll be poorer if they spend their money now than before, they just get taxed when they spend their money rather than before.    So there's no intent to drive economic policy, your just taking less control. If you don't think the state should have control over life and death, you wouldn't see the end of capital punishment to be bad. Yes, they are making a decision over life and death, but the decision is to step away from making those kinds if decisions. The FairTax is that kind of economic policy. Its a change in our policy, but its a reduction for the purpose of reduction, not for the purpose of exerting control. ",©

t5_2u06v,Rantzy,1347885309,"**UPDATE: Called a Crisis line last night.** I was really feeling the urge to self-harm. The pain inside was so intense and blindsiding. I am beginning to wonder if this deep and sudden depression is a side-effect of the new medication. Nothing I do seems to help me cope. I took a two-hour walk yesterday and I still had a break down in the late afternoon. I love my son, I really do. He deserves a mom who doesn't hurt inside like this for no apparent reason.  The mobile crisis unit counselors are coming to talk to me this morning. I refused to go to the hospital or anywhere without my baby. So she said this would be a good option. I'm a little nervous... I hope they aren't going to try to commit me or anything... I just need to know what to do to lessen the *intensity* of these raw emotions so I can manage. My psychiatrist put me into serotonin syndrome and this is the third thing he's done that Ihave considered incompetent or not-quite-ethical so I saw a specialist who told me how to titrate my medication properly. But now I'm at a loss. I call my psychiatrist (privately to myself) Dr. Buttnugget. I don't want to go back to Dr. Buttnugget after the serotonin syndrome episode... and I'm on the waitlist for someone new (program with psychiatrist and psychologist combined). Everything is just ... ""hurry up and wait."" Later today is Baby and Mommy fitness class... but it's going to be a hard push for me to even go today...  Unfortunately, my close family and friends live 17 hours away. My husband's family is very ... analytical or logical in their approach to things. If it doesn't make sense, they don't understand. If there is no reason to feel this bad, then I should just be capable of using willpower to free myself or I should get my medications fixed and then all will be fine. It's like they ignore the feelings entirely, as if they're just a symptom to be considered, analyzed, labeled, and shelved. They don't understand how *consuming* the feelings can be, how they are like rapids that drag at you constantly and try relentlessly to pull you under. Feelings make his family uncomfortable.  Thank you all for your supportive words, by the way. I can't tell you how much it means to me to have people who understand, people who simply care across the miles about a stranger, it chokes me up. ♥ I don't feel worthy of it but I do know how lucky it makes me not to have to ride this out completely alone.",♥

September 16, 2012 &gt; &gt;Parking along the 0-100 block of West Randolph Street isn't cheap. &gt;From 8 a.m. to 9 p.m., it costs $5.75 an hour; overnight parking costs about half that amount. &gt; &gt;At those rates, parking along the street for 24 hours would set you back a hefty $106.38. &gt; &gt;For months, the 26-year-old has been parking her motorcycle in what you might call Loop loopholes — small patches of downtown streets that are neither covered by the seemingly omnipresent meters nor marked as restricted. &gt; &gt;In other words, Targos has found slivers of space where she can legally park her 1996 Honda VT 600 for free. &gt; &gt;The free spots are widely known by fellow motorcycle riders who park in them daily, Targos said.

t5_2qj8f,p1dbull,1347885426,"&gt; Caveat: ""Invincible Germany,"" in the context of the presentation being made, means to have a Germany with a sufficiently highly developed state of consciousness that its people will radiate such goodness and light to the universe that everyone will want to be their friends, thereby ensuring that Germany will have no enemies, thereby ensuring that Germany is invincible.  This context wasn't given in this presentation at all, the Raja thought it was a good idea to march into this forum and let people chant ""Invincible Germany"" like it was a Nuremberg Rally of the Nazi Party.

You can find them at Toys R Us, Walmart, and Walgreens, and they are blind bagged. I had the most luck at Walgreens.   Avengers Cosmic Spear Loki – Pretty easy to find. Got mine at Toys R Us but I have also seen them at Target and Walmart, and [on Amazon]( http://www.amazon.com/Marvel-Avengers-Action-Figure-Cosmic/dp/B007DJ91ME/ref=sr_1_2?s=toys-and-games&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1347900304&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=avengers+loki).  Marvel Class Figurine Loki – This is part of the lead figurine series that Marvel releases in the UK. They do a new one every month. Got him at a local comic book store but lots of websites online sell the figures.  Thor Sorcerer Fury Loki – Found on eBay  Thor Secret Strike Loki – The same figure as the one next to him, but his outfit is different colors and he came with a different weapon. Also found on eBay.  &gt; [Small](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mafdalGq871qhefmdo4_1280.jpg)  Minimates Avengers Loki – Found at Toys R Us, also easy to find on eBay  Minimates Thor Loki – Same as above  Avengers Loki minifigure – Found [here](http://www.amazon.com/Marvel-Avengers-Movie-Action-Figure/dp/B007EYVG0S/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1347900657&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=avengers+loki) on Amazon. Didn’t realize he was only about 2 inches tall when I bought him!  Megabloks Marvel Loki – Found at Toys R Us, but they are blind bagged so you have to feel around before knowing you have a Loki (it’s the helmet that gives it away)  Lego Loki – Found on eBay   &gt; [Really small](http://i.imgur.com/jU3Nq.jpg)  Avengers Loki Heroclix – I play Heroclix and he was given to me by one of the people I play with. He is pretty hard to find.  Squinkies Loki – Came with the movie Avengers Squinkies set. Found at Toys R Us. These things are adorable.  Chibi Loki – Another blind bagged set. Found at Five Below, Target and Walmart.  Chaos War Loki Heroclix – A rare Heroclix from the recently released Chaos War set. Traded for him at my Heroclix game.

t5_2r4b9,Troxle,1347904693,"I feel fully transition and really only came to the conclusion yesterday while at work (MtF).  I used to hang out with all boys and play boy things in school, all but my first few years (I played house with a girl and it is some of my best memories thinkin' back on it!), but I would play tag and we had a game called ""The Muck Monster"" where a friend in a higher grade would just chase us around pretendin' to be a monster.  Even doin' all this, I still wished to do stuff like paint my nails and grow my hair, and when I asked my mom, she gently put me down ""Boys don't do those things.""  So I sucked it up and went on bein' a boy.  In middle school me and my best friend ended up hookin' up (both of us male ""at the time"") and we were practically inseparable, but no one knew we were datin'.  I ended up findin' skirts in the spare bedroom's closet and we used to roleplay with them a lot and it felt so comfortin'.  But we eventually went out ways and lost contact, but I didn't shed a tear, ""I was a man. Men don't cry.""  I never really touched the skirts again save for maybe once or twice, too many bad memories...  Do you think I view myself as not a woman growin' up because I did what men are supposed to do?  Suck it up and not cry and deal with it?  No!  Fuck, I've learned to cry into a pillow at night thinkin' of how much life sucked havin' to be a man (this was in recent years), but I always woke up the next day and sucked it up.  I've always just wished for a magic spell or button to change my gender so that I wouldn't have to just suck it up and be a man.  I want to be a woman, its me damnit!  Just cause you cry doesn't mean you aren't a man. Ask yourself:  &gt; What makes you happy?  &gt; Can you see yourself as a woman years down the road?  &gt; Can you see yourself as a man years down the road?  Hormones suck, even if you don't feel in the right body, your gender is all wrong, the hormones keep comin' and they act against what you really feel.  You need to realize this first, so your tears might just be an extension of your body pumpin' out the wrong hormones, and even still, I've seen ""real men"" break down and cry.  I hope you figure everythin' out for yourself!  You do NOT have to have a label for who you are.  A label only helps describe who you are to other people in the easiest fashion possible.  Just be yourself and do what feels right!  **TL;DR: I always acted as a ""boy"" growin' up (for the most part) and did ""boy"" things, but I don't feel right continuin' to be a man.  I know the feelin', just be yourself and do what YOU are comfortable with, don't let labels get you down!**  ♥♥♥",♥

t5_2ssp3,Ernest_Frawde,1347907564,"[Léo Taxil](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LÃ©o_Taxil) was the pen name of a French writer known for the [Taxil Hoax](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxil_hoax). Born in 1854, he spent part of his childhood in a Jesuit school and developed a strong dislike of Christianity. He grew up to become an author and journalist and focused mostly on writing anti-clerical and anti-Catholic books and articles. He became somewhat infamous and in 1879 was tried for insulting a state recognized religion.  Yet in 1886 he declared his conversion to Catholicism and began publishing supposed histories of Freemasonry which mostly amounted to conspiracy theories. Taxil's denunciations of Freemasonry became popular reading among French Catholics. He published a series of books and a newspaper on the subject. This culminated with the book *Le Diable au XIXè siècle* which contained the confessions of Diana Vaughn, a ""High Priestess of Lucifer"". At the peak of his popularity he was called to attend an audience with Pope Leo XIII who was incensed about the Bishop of Charleston's denunciation of anti-Masonic propaganda and wanted to consult with Taxil, who was by now regarded as the Catholic specialist on Freemasons.   By then however, journalists had been investigating Taxil's anti-Masonic claims and had been seeking out Diana Vaughn. Taxil announced that he would hold a lecture where he would present the high-priestess. The lecture was held and instead of presenting her to the crowd Taxil explained that she had never existed and that his conversion and anti-Masonic writing were hoaxes intended to highlight the church's fanaticism. He also described previous hoaxes he had perpetrated. One was about an underwater city in Lake Geneva which attracted archaeologists and tourists for several years. He had also convinced the authorities of Marseille that the harbour was full of sharks, creating a panic and forcing the authorities to send boats out to hunt these sharks.  I can't remember where I read about him, but he was a fascinating character and unfortunately the Wikipedia article about him doesn't go into great detail. If I recall correctly even his anti-clericalism was somehow dubious. It would be great if someone could elaborate on his story. Especially the underwater city and shark stories.",©

t5_2tx47,mnemyx,1347918184,":(  I send you my best regards and wishes ♥  I hope you find someone (or something) that'll make your heart a little lighter, be it a pet, hobby, or a new person.  Most, if not all, of my ex's have cheated on me and have made me cry on my birthdays.  The last one was particularly bad - our relationship was a ticking time bomb (I've posted about it before).  And had he not cheated on me and broken me down, I wouldn't be who I am today.  The experience of being in an abusive relationship helped me realize all the things we were doing wrong, not that I think this is a good experience for anyone.  No one should have to go through that, but in my case, it was a lesson learned.  But it's the reason I'm now in a better relationship with someone new for the past year and a half.  He's been wonderful and sweet.  He's my best friend, and he's also the one that's helped me regain the self-confidence and trust for others which I lost during my last relationship.     His family has also become the family that I've never had.  I'm estranged from my real family for many reasons...so it's nice to feel like I belong somewhere.  They've provided me with the stability I didn't think could be possible in life.  And honestly, it's because of them that makes life worth experiencing.  I really hope to be there for them as they've been there for me.  And the funny story of how my SO and I met.  We met on OKC (I know, I know).  He recognized my new account (my ex deleted my old one while we were dating) and decided to message me about how we were in the same major, at the same college, and had almost the same group of friends.  What I didn't know then was he had also messaged my old account (never saw that message...it would've been about a year to two years ago from the time we first met and right around when I first met my ex) from his old account.  Apparently he had deleted his old account, and then decided to make a new one again.  He had really wanted to meet me then, so when he recognized my new account, he was really hoping I'd respond.  And I did; we met for bubble tea; and he's been around since then.  Things work out in weird ways.",♥

How much profit the event will generate won't be knowable until after the event occurs.    &gt;Providing Fox News and their affiliates with any revenue helps propagate... The event isn't being put on by either News Corp. or Viacom.  As stated on the website: ""© Straight Talk, Inc./Busboy Productions, Inc.""  I'm sure that Daily Show viewers recognize Busboy Productions as Jon Stewart's production company (includes media projects outside the purview of Comedy Central).  Given O'Reilly's ""straight talk express"", I'd assume that the other is his production company.    It would be interesting to know exactly which charities will benefit from this event.

Here is some information on breathing (from yoga) This is **LONG** and the formatting might be kinda messy (just copy and pasted from a document)  --------------------  Types of Breathing Techniques - Student Handout  Below are several of the most commonly used forms of pranayama.  **Ujjayi Pranayama**  *The victory or ocean sounding breath*  Benefits:  ♥ Focuses the mind  ♥ Increases mindfulness  ♥ Generates internal heat  ♥ Grounding  ♥ Aids in concentration  Ujjayi Pranayama is called the ocean sounding breath, and somewhat irreverently as the ""Darth Vader"" breath, because you make an ocean sound by contracting the glottis with the inhalation and exhalation. This Pranayama is done through the nose, but it is helpful to begin practicing breathing through the mouth. To make the ocean sound, whisper the syllable ""h,"" feeling the contraction in your throat. Keep this contraction engaged on the inhalation and exhalation. After a couple of breaths try to close the mouth, breathing through the nose while still making the ocean sound in your throat.  **How to do it**  1. Come into a comfortable seated position with your spine erect, or lie down on your back. Visualize lifting you belly towards your chin and begin by taking long, slow, and deep breaths through the nostrils.  2. Allow the breath to be gentle and relaxed as you lower the tongue and open the back of the throat creating a steady ""Darth Vader"" sound as you breathe in and out. The sound need not be forced, but it should be loud enough so that if someone came close to you they would hear it.  3. Lengthen the inhalation and the exhalation as much as possible without creating tension anywhere in your body, and allow the sound of the breath to be continuous and smooth.  4. To help create the proper ""ah"" sound, hold your hand up to your mouth and exhale as if trying to fog a mirror. Inhale the same way. Notice how you opent the back of the throat to create the fog effect. Now close your mouth and do the same thing while breathing through the nose.  **When to do it**  During asana practice; Before meditation; Anytime you want to concentrate  ---------------  **Dirga Pranayama**  *The 3 part breath or complete breath*  Benefits  ♥ Calming and relaxing  ♥ Promotes proper diaphragmatic breathing, relaxes the mind and body, oxygenates the blood and purges the lungs of residual carbon dioxide.  Dirga Pranayama is called the three part breath because you are actively breathing into three parts of your abdomen, the three chambers of the lungs. The first position is the low belly (on top of or just below the belly button), the second position is the low chest (lower half of the rib cage), and the third position is the low throat (just above the top of the sternum). The breath is continuous, inhaled and exhaled through of the nose. The inhalation starts in the first position, the low belly; then moves to the second position, the low chest; then to the third position, the low throat. The exhalation starts in the low throat, moves to the low chest, and finishes in the low belly. Rest your hands on the individual positions to feel the breath rising and falling through each position. When you start practicing, you may want to individually isolate the movement in each position, using the hands. When you have a good feel for the breath moving in and out of each position, practice without the hands. Eventually relax the effort of the Pranayama and breathe into the three positions gently, feeling a wave of breath move up and down the torso.  **How to do it**  Sit with your spine erect, or lie down on your back. Begin taking long, slow, and deep breaths through the nostrils.  1. As you inhale, allow the belly to fill with air, drawing air deep into the lower lungs. As you exhale, allow the belly to deflate like a balloon. Repeat several times, keeping the breath smooth and relaxed, and never straining. Repeat several times.  2. Breathe into your belly as in Step #1, but also expand the mid-chest region by allowing the rib cage to open outward to the sides. Exhale and repeat several times.  3. Follow steps #1 and #2 and continue inhaling by opening the clavicular region or upper chest. Exhale and repeat.   Combine all three steps into one continuous or complete flow.  **When to do it**  During asana practice; Prior to meditation; Prior to relaxation; Anytime you feel like it  ---------------  **Nadi Sodhana Pranayama**  *Alternate nostril breathing or sweet breath.*  Benefits  ♥ Calms the mind,relaxing  ♥ Soothes anxiety and stress  ♥ Balances left and right hemispheres, promotes clear thinking.  It is simple form of alternate nostril breathing suitable for beginning and advanced students. Nadi means channel and refers to the energy pathways through which prana flows. Shodhana means cleansing -- so Nadi Shodhana means channel cleaning.  **How to do it**  1. Hold your right hand up and curl your index and middle fingers toward your palm. Place your thumb next to your right nostril and your ring finger and pinky by your left. Close the left nostril by pressing gently against it with your ring finger and pinky, and inhale through the right nostril. The breath should be slow, steady and full.  2. Now close the right nostril by pressing gently against it with your thumb, and open your left nostril by relaxing your ring finger and pinky and exhale fully with a slow and steady breath.  3. Inhale through the left nostril, close it, and then exhale through the right nostril. That's one complete round of Nadi Shodhana – . Continue, doing 5-20 rounds.  4. Inhale through the right nostril  5. Exhale through the left  6. Inhale through the left  7. Exhale through the right. Begin with 5-10 rounds and add more as you feel ready. Remember to keep your breathing slow, easy and full.  **When to do it**  Just about any time and any where. Try it as a mental warm-up before meditation to help calm the mind and put you in the mood. You can also do it as part of your centering before beginning an asana or posture routine. Also try it at times throughout the day. Nadi Shodhana helps control stress and anxiety. If you start to feel stressed out, 10 or so rounds will help calm you down. It also helps soothe anxiety caused by flying and other fearful or stressful situations.  ---------------  **Kabalabahti Pranayama**  *the breath of fire or the skull shining breath*  Benefits ♥ Invigorating ♥ Energizing ♥ purifying  **How to do it** Kapalabhati is a very active, forced exhalation with a passive inhalation. To exhale, the belly quickly pumps into the spine forcing the air out of the nose (like trying to blow out a candle through you nose). Place a hand on your belly to feel the belly actively pumping.  Play with the tempo (45-60 exhalations/30 seconds), but keep a steady rhythm. Start with 2-3 rounds of 30 exhalations, and gradually increase the exhalations if comfortable.  ---------------  **Sit Cari Pranayama**  *the hissing breath*  Benefits  ♥ cools the body  **How to do it**  Curl the tongue touching the roof of the mouth as far back as you can to the soft pallet. As you inhale clench the teeth together and slightly part the lips making a hissing ""ssss"" sound. Exhale through both nostrils. Repeat 5-10 times.  ---------------  **Shitali Pranayama**  *the cooling breath*  Benefits  ♥ cools the body  **How to do it**  Roll the tongue into a tube (as best as you can) and stick the tip of the tongue out of the mouth. Inhale through the tongue and hold the breath in for 4-5 seconds with the chin pressed against the chest. Exhale using Ujjayi Pranayama through the nose.   Repeat 5-10 times",♥

Just say that you heard her and ask her to please not talk about you to her friends if it's going to be embarrassing like that.

It is especially popular in Asia, Africa and the Caribbean. &gt; &gt;These beers are all made with the highest quality natural ingredients, all brewed using the same unique and expert GUINNESS® brewing techniques.   The only taste difference will be from style to style.  The only real factors that may make you think they taste different, is caused by keg freshness, and tap cleanliness. Both of which can happen anywhere. ",®

And my friend is not familiar with reddit at all (too bad for him! :D). He's quite new to the game, but I've been playing for about a month. Since we are tired of all the fudging hackers out there, we figured we should try this out as our friends (who already play at Banana) ""OnOff"" and ""Jocke"" mentioned your server last night, and told us we should apply.  Also the fact that you run a private hive makes this interesting, since we won't experience any server-hoopers and hopefully not much of hacked in weapons.  An extra plus would be that the server is swedish, the same as us! Low Ping ♥  Other then that I can't say much more then that we're two friendly players who play several times a week, fair and want a more hacker-secured server. Accept us already! :)",♥

You can pick up an X-Fi Fatal1ty Pro for around 100 bux refurbished. I dont know how it does it, (Accurate 3D positional audio with X-Fi CMSS®-3D. Locate enemies by sound alone - you'll get amazing surround sound, even with normal stereo headphones.) But it does sound fully 3-d. The chopper above you sounds like it is ABOVE, and guys in tunnels sound like they are below... it is weird/immersive. I will never go back to a non dolby card. Also it adds 64mb of x-ram which can be helpful taking off some load from your board depending on your current setup. ",®

In some ways I was lucky that the only thing that hurt until my nerves started to be weird far more recently was the first time my throat bandage got taken off (I am a hairy person).  I suppose there are a lot of big differences between our ordeals, but brains and backs are both rather important parts of any person. It sounds like you aren't lacking in motivation or potential for recovery, and you sound like a terrifically strong woman. Progress may feel slow at times, and you might feel like your time could be so much better spent, but you're going to come out a far wiser person just as a result of all of the extra life experience you didn't really want, and I don't imagine you letting this hold you back from any of the things you might have wanted to do beforehand, assuming you didn't want to do pogo marathons.  Know that though the hard times and the harder times, there will always be a day where you will feel better than you do, and most of the time it will be the very next one.

t5_2r4b9,mtfmtf,1348223789,"I experimented with Yasmin (a.k.a. Yasminelle®, Yaz®, Beyaz®, Ocella®, Zarah®, and Angeliq®) for a couple of months while self-medicating. I had been using Progynova (Estradiol Valerate) prior to that but decided to give Yasmin a go for two reasons:  1) It was considerably cheaper.  2) It contained Drospirenone - A synthetic progestogen closely related to Spironolactone.  I figured I'd be adding a Progestin *and* an anti-androgen for half the price of the Estradiol.   At the time I was taking 4 pills a day - 2 in the mornings and 2 before bed. I can't definitively say whether it had the desired effects or not but I ended up switching back to the Estradiol Valerate because at the time I felt it wasn't working as well.  According to my research, the dose was sufficient to achieve feminization and shortly after switching back to Progynova development slowed down again leading me to now think it was less to do with what I was taking and more to do with growth cycles and a diet that was not conducive of development.  In conclusion, external factors and a relatively brief sample period means results were inconclusive.  N.B.  Ethinylestradiol, the Estrogen in Yasmin, is among the most dangerous of the synthetic Estrogens.   Drospirenone affects your renal function.  Any self administered HRT is dangerous but these two components make this a particularly high risk drug. If you are going to go down the DIY path you should really do your research. The number of hours I committed to research isn't measured in hours or even days - I'm speaking weeks. Hundreds of hours. There is a lot of crap to wade through but you are taking your own health (and possibly your life) in your hands. No offence but if you are asking such fundamental questions as this, then I don't think you've done enough in preparation.   I'm not going to say whether you should or shouldn't self-medicate because I would do it all again given the choice; but do the leg work, take an interest in it. The research itself actually become quite 'fun' (for lack of a better word). The documentation available is very sketchy - often you'll need to infer and extrapolate from similar situations (Men suffering from gynecomastia, women with elevated testosterone levels, men undergoing treatment for prostate cancer, etc.) but that's just one of many hurdles.  *Edit 1*  *I realised I went on a bit of a tangent and didn't really answer your question:*  &gt;*whether or not a healthy guy in their mid twenty's would have any serious long term consequences to taking a pill a day for a month to feel/look a bit more feminine.*  *I'm in my mid twenty's, healthy enough, and have tried birth control pills as a HRT substitute and IMO, 1 pill a day for a month will have no noticeable effect at all beside possibly 'placebic' ones.*",®

t5_2fwo,aim2free,1348266378,"Upvote from me (even though I know that that you downvoted me :)  &gt; it's worrying to learn that I haven't yet even *started* to understand computer science.  The answer you provided is exactly that kind of humble answer I appreciate from someone who has started realizing something.  &gt; I guess my PhD in bioinformatics   Cool, for my own, I'm actually sitting in a house with lots of bioinformatics people. We have our offices ([NeuroLogic](http://neurologic.se/) as well as [Wish-IT®, Wish Innovation Technologies ®](http://wish-it.se) *(the latter in development)* in the same house as my old research group (computer science but nowadays this group is denoted [computational biology](http://www.csc.kth.se/forskning/cb/), mostly brain simulations) where I did my PhD, nine years ago.  &gt; the algorithms I've published in peer-reviewed journals don't really count.  It counts, but to understand the issue of the bad impact of patents in software, it needs a lot more. As you obviously read my old experience from my Master Thesis Project in early 80-ies, and my references to the cartoons with Gyro Gearloose and Ludwig von Drake (my childhood's idols ;) but still kind of defend this abomination denoted ""software patent"" you have certainly obtained some kind of idealistic view that patenting an algorithm is not much different to patenting something else. Here you can immediately see a threat to free open source software. If an algorithm is published in source code, then everyone can read it, and everyone is able to improve it, so open source is an easy target. However, a proprietary software manufacturer, although they are getting quite rare nowadays fortunately, can hide their algorithms.  Regarding algorithms I can refer to a beautiful case where my PhD opponent was called as an expert witness in a patent trial early 2000. The company that claimed that their patent had been infringed by another company said they had aimed several years to devolop this algorithm, in court they had to describe what their algorithm did, and then my opponent (Prof. Hava Siegelmann) was called as a witness and being told the problem. She aimed less than 15 minutes to write an algorithm that was almost identical to the one claimed to be infringed. Case immediately dismissed :)  The idea of patenting an algorithm is simply not efficient! . Programmers invent all the time and solutiions which are obvious and trivial for an expert, like a programmer, may not be obvious for people outside this field. Patenting may be more efficient in some cases for proprietary vendors (which fortunatly are getting rare), but as soon as you publish the algorithm, it is no secret, then you get a conflict. Are other similar algorithms parallel inventions or copies? (As I'm  a programmer I can tell you that when standing in front of a particular problem, I do not start searching for any solution on the web, as there are not search engines for such searches, yet. I start solving the problem. When the optimal solution is found, this will of course be similar to any other close to optimal solutions found.The abomination detoned ""software patent"" can not help here.   By the way, as you are in research and have published your algorithms, I can refer to my own algorithms also published (I've developed an early warning system now used globally by WHO for adverse drug reactions), where I won an award for best application paper at [KDD 2005](http://www.sigkdd.org/kdd2005/awards.html). However, I do not understand, why are you defending software patents?   If you are in research you are certainly not there because of making profit from your work, but to work with interesting stuff, even though also people in ANN like Stephen Grossberg, has patented certain algorithmic stuff... insane!! Anyway, I definitely do not understand what this has to do with software patents. Although there have been cases of so called submarine patents where algorithms have been published and at the same time patented... this ugly thing happend LZW compression, gif and MP3 for instance. Fortunately there were ways out, png replaced gif, ogg replaced mp3 and so on, but still... Now, finally gif is free since some years but it's annoying.  By the way, where do you publish? Many of my research papers are terribly locked in by copyright beasts, although you can find most of them anyway. Of course if you are on a university network. One magazine [where I published in 2000](http://orre.neurologic.org/webref/index.html#orre:orlabali2000) ""Computational Statistics and Data Analysis"" turned out to be so expensive that my institute couldn't even afford the subscription, so they cancelled it. Nowadays there are plenty of better opportunities, especially in biology and bioinformatics. One of these journals are [Plos](http://www.plos.org/), where everyone can access your papers and your results can reach much more people.  I'll never ever publish anything any more without a Creative Commons or similar licence. There are too many valuable research papers locked in by strong copyright :( There are lots of people in this world who has been brainwashed into oblivion to believe in this obscure mystical but severly blind ""profit"" thinking. Despite they then cancel lots of opportunities for themselves and for the whole world to develop due to their work. I simply consider them insane. It's a kind of mental disease or disablement.",®

t5_2qyt6,TIGGER_WARNING,1348363971,"It's hard to know.  Look at how porn works: A far greater number of straight men than gay women consume gay porn featuring women.     You can figure that out just from the % ratio of homosexuality in the population to gay titles on the porn market.  Likewise, a far greater number of straight women than gay men consume gay porn featuring men.     So the marketing isn't necessarily indicative of the actual audience.   Finally, there are the broader gender interactions to think about. The concept of gay men and straight women sharing interests, taste in men, and generally being friendly with each other as a natural consequence of their relative sexualities is fairly pervasive in the western world, but there's no well-defined cultural notion of chumminess between gay women and straight men.  ***** ***** ###Edit *****  For those who aren't trolls, consider the math:  ▶ **~[1/3] of porn consumers are women.**^^[1]  If we *conservatively* estimate that only 1 in 17 of those viewers watch gay male porn regularly, then:  ▶ **The total number of women watching gay male porn is on par with the number of gay men who *exist*.**^^[2]  At a rate of 1 in 10, the number of female viewers jumps up to 1.65x the number of gay men who exist.   ***** ###Round Two *****  That could have been more clear. Let's try it again. First things first:   ▶ **Only ~2% of the population is gay.**^^[3]  I shouldn't have assumed that would be common knowledge.  Now a couple of points:  ▷ The statistic on female porn viewers is a somewhat fuzzy one.   ▷ The gay male statistic of [4/3] of a viewer out of 100^^[4] doesn't mean anything physically.    So: I rounded the number of gay male porn viewers in a representative sample of 100 up to 2.  ▶ **That's the same number, 2, that you'd expect if all porn viewers were male.**^^[5]  From this, we can see that if only 1 in 17 women consumes gay male porn, then:  ▶ **Female viewership is equal to the largest possible gay male viewership: 1 in 50 Americans.**  That 1 in 17 includes straight and gay women.    ***** ###The Purpose Of All This *****  *Only* to show how unlikely it would be for gay men to make up the majority of the audience for gay male porn.      ▶ **Given moderate or even low interest from women, female viewers will still outnumber gay men.**  No sneaky ulterior motives for this claim, just some back-of-the-envelope math.  ▶ **To be clear: No direct evidence was given for 1 in 17 women watching gay male porn.**  Anecdotally and intuitively, however, this seems plausible at the very least, if not probable.   ***** ###Notes *****  ^([1]: Not seeing the source on this specific statistic in google scholar results right now, but it's standard.)     ^([2]: This assumes rough equivalency between the porn viewing rates of straight and gay men.)     ^([3]: That's the figure you'll find if you look up the academic lit, the CDC's research, etc.)     ^([4]: Probability[Male Porn Viewer] x Probability[Gay] x 100 = [2/3] x [1/50] x 100 = [4/3])     ^([5]: Again assuming that gay and straight men consume pornography at roughly equal rates.)  *****",▶

t5_2qmij,carpe-jvgvlvm,1348371180,"I'm pretty fine these days until I have to any paperwork relating to my parents, and then I get ""frozen"", like a mental block. I can do all my own paperwork and bills fine, just not *their* stuff. I'll stare at their stuff for *hours*, frozen in anxiety, even though it's pretty easy stuff (pay a bill, write a letter, sign an agreement, etc.)  I consciously know why I'm ""blocked"": my dad is hyper-critical. ""Unintentionally abusive"" (criticism-wise). He was a perfectionist, especially financially, and thought I was a blonde ditz (even though I majored in math, heh). When I finally got on my own, life just got really nice and relaxed (college, b/f and marriage, babies). I didn't ignore my parents entirely; I just separated my life from them somewhat because they were so hard to please and critical. And they didn't seem to mind the separation. It wasn't ""bad""; they did their thing, I did mine.  Then in 2007, they were both in a pretty gruesome trauma, and I had to sorta ""take over"" their lives for 9 months (they were both in and out of hospitals for varying reasons all those 9 months; every other day was like a new fire to put out). I was young and did some morally-questionable things (though with guidance from my priest and even doctors). Primarily, **I vacated my dad's DNR**, and he's suffered ever since (half his heart is dead; he's had two amputations; had to learn to talk again; hard therapy; etc). I'm still unsure if I did the right thing (there are times since that he's said he's happier than he'd ever been!) But yes, it was ""wrong"" to vacate his DNR; I see that in retrospect. I was thinking with my heart and not my brain, you know? And I'd never seen ""trauma"" except on TV, I guess.  Then I had to get my mother committed against her will due to brain damage which presented as paranoid schizophrenia; she's *dangerous* (tried to throw my niece down stairs, attacked four police officers that first week in 2007...). I had to struggle for over 36 hours without sleep to get her committed, in a few different cities (because it was a weekend), and only when she tried to bite the face of her own advocate (from CSB) did they commit her. Mom was committed in another city, but escaped the first facility the first night. They gave me police protection that next day because she had apparently threatened to kill me. I was more worried for her safety and others'; Mom's not really like that — it's brain damage. Part of me thought she knew dad was dying in the hospital; she's a huge reason I fought to keep my dad alive.  But I did all that, cool as a cucumber! —Until things settled down near the end of 2007 (both parents home and relatively healthy/medicated, financially comfortable, etc), except I had to ""help"" them from that time on. Mom did okay with her anti-psychotics, but Dad was furious with me for keeping him alive against his will and him becoming a cripple. I had to go over there and write out his bills because he'd lost use of his hands (temporarily); and he was *cruel* to me (understandably; his DNR was very clear, and it was completely ignored).  My whole life changed that year, and I tried to keep my spirits up with friends and family (esp my babies!), but I was on the road all the time for my parents, raising my family, and making myself take ""breaks"" (have a social life) because I knew the basics of extreme stress. Still, I started having night terrors and panic attacks. GP put me on benzos, and I'm still on them. Psychologist was helpful but basically said I couldn't get better unless I stopped ""throwing myself under the bus"" (helping my cruel dad and [unintentionally] scary mom).  I took my psychologist's advice on many occasions, but when I hired help (on top of all their physical therapists and stuff) to ""do my dad's bidding"", Dad attacked the girl, and said he'd do it again and again; he literally wanted me to suffer (said so) because I'd kept him alive and should have to suffer, too. After that, my psychologist basically quit (*nicely*; great guy) because he said I couldn't get better under those circumstances.  That sounds horrible, but the lorazepam kept me going without taking things personally. CBT had helped me keep in mind it wasn't ""my fault"" (basically, that *shit happens*). My priest gave me absolution so the guilt wasn't so bad. A LOT of people in the community helped too (esp because of Mom): they'd visit, help fill out paperwork, etc. I was really blessed (and they didn't even know I was having stress problems; people just helped out of the kindness of their hearts!)  Finally, this year, they were both institutionalized (one nursing home, one mental institution) because they were both out of hand (Dad broke his hip; Mom tried to ""quiet"" his wheelchair alarm by attempted murder... institutions for them both!). I'd tried hard to keep them in their own home, but even Adult Protective Services got involved and basically said ""Aww hell no!"" Dad needed 24/7 care; Mom's meds had stopped working and she needed Haldol shots and a padded room.  I figured my pressure would ease up. I emptied their house (which was *harddddd*), am trying to sell it, became my mom's guardian officially, etc. Things *have* eased up, a *lot*!  —But I can't push myself to open their mail! I wait until people call me (collections!) and then try to work with them on the phone. I can't balance their checkbooks anymore; I can't do ANY paperwork re: them without freezing. Hyperventilating. Pacing the floor looking at unopened mail.  When their mail piles up enough, I shove it into a box. I have three boxes. I mean, it's *crazy*.  I keep my spirits up by focusing on my kids and blocking out my parents while I try to enjoy life; I even visit my parents, though that's hard because Mom (after years of anti-psychotics) is like a zombie, and Dad's gone back to being verbally **mean** (to me and the nurses) because he hates the nursing home. *But I visit.* With a smile on my face. (It takes courage to *get* there, but then I handle it well). I feel like that's what I can do, and pat myself on the back for doing it.  I just can't open their mail. (Even on the benzos! They switched me to Xanax recently, and that made me ""happier"" like drunk-happier, but STILL I couldn't open the mail.)  I know it's like PTSD, but I just can't get past it. I'm trying the mindfulness meditations to help me stay cool when I *see* their mail, but I'm not to the point where I can open the mail. I try to envision it, though.  I think, and this sounds horrible, but it's been a long haul taking care of them, and maybe I just want all the paperwork for my parents to be *over*. I'd rather scrub toilets for free (and actually, sorta do, for my friends!) than touch a piece of their mail. I know I have some anger towards Dad that I just can't seem to get past; maybe I *want* to see their home taken (failure to pay taxes) or something, because Dad was such a perfectionist with his finances. I hope that's not it, but I can't figure out what else it could be.  Sorry so long; just wanted it to be clear that my ""hangup"" has some real basis, and I've tried but just can't get past that mental block.  (You know, just writing this out has helped me a lot! Seriously! Shit, that's cool!) Maybe it's not so bad to just let their stuff go! (Well, except I'm POA and guardian. Oops!) But thanks for offering to help; sorry so long! ♥",♥

However, corporations also have limited liability (which is why you don't see, for example, all of BP's public shareholders being sued over the oil spills).

t5_2rp0r,jfroncioni,1348414042,"Yes.  Here is an excerpt from my running injuries article:     ""Is it possible to rehabilitate the weakened muscles of a normally shod runner?  It certainly is according to another excellent study by Dr. Robbins (1987).  He asked 17 normally shod recreational runners to gradually increase barefoot activity both at home and outdoors over a period of several weeks and to maintain barefoot activity for about four months.  The runners' feet were examined, measured and x-rayed at regular intervals to detect changes.  Results showed marked improvement in the anatomy and function of the arch.  The authors concluded that the normally shod foot is capable of rehabilitation of foot musculature.  Very good news indeed for all of us.""

Quoting Summer from 500 Days of Summer was my favorite thing to do when someone would talk about love. ""Love is just a fantasy"" He was browsing for boyish reasons, and I was either bored or high looking for some cool people to talk to because I know there are a few out there. I asked him if he had Skype, he didn't. So I made him make one. We added each other and never missed a day. We finally moved to Facebook, and our relationship blossomed. He would actually give me advice on this boy I had a crush on in my History 122 class. When things with him didn't work out, I didn't really care, because I had feelings for someone else(:♥ We've been together since May and I've never been happier.

The rebound is being driven by several factors including lower energy costs, higher labour expenses in competitors such as China and the potential to use idle US port capacity for pushing up exports, according to the report by Boston Consulting Group.  As a result the US has the potential to increase goods exports by up to $130bn by 2020, in the process adding 5m jobs to the US economy.

In particular, the cost disadvantage the US suffers compared with China is starting to decrease.  While in 2010, the cost of turning out a dollar’s worth of goods in a Chinese factory was on average 12 per cent less than the equivalent cost in the US; by 2015 the cost gap will be reduced to 7 per cent, the consultants say.  Hal Sirkin, a manufacturing expert at BCG, said: “A range of underlying changes are taking place in the US economy that will give a boost to manufacturing, even if some of this has yet to show up in the [production] data.”  However, the study’s findings have sparked scepticism among some economic analysts, particularly in the light of weak factory output figures in recent months. Last year, the US lost its role as the world’s biggest maker of manufactured goods to China, the first time for more than 100 years that the country had not taken this position.  Gary Pisano, a Harvard Business School professor who is co-author of a forthcoming book, Producing Prosperity: Why America Needs a Manufacturing Renaissance, said: “I still don’t see the indications that the kind of sea change in [company] behaviour [that could bring about a prolonged manufacturing recovery] is really happening.”  Alan Tonelson, research fellow at the US Business and Industry Council, a lobbying group, said the BCG’s upbeat conclusions failed to take into account “higher incentives” that competitor nations such as China were likely to provide their domestic companies to boost manufacturing.  “Countries such as China are unlikely to sit on their hands and do nothing if the US does improve in manufacturing,” said Mr Tonelson.  Also, there are signs that factory activity in the US is starting to dip, after a strong run during 2010 and 2011, when manufacturing added more than 400,000 jobs, compensating in part for some of the hefty employment reductions during the economic 2008/09 crisis.  In August, the Institute for Supply Management’s index for manufacturing showed its third straight month of weakness while the factory sector shed 15,000 jobs.  Even so, the ideas in the BCG report are supported by a number of large production companies such as General Electric and Toyota that are increasing their investments in the US, partly with a view to add to exports.  The announcements have led some to echo the consultants’ view that the US might be on the brink of a “reshoring” trend in which some lost manufacturing output gradually returns.  George Magnus, an economic adviser to the UBS investment bank, said: “I’m quite persuaded by the substance of the [BCG] arguments that the pendulum is starting to swing back to the US [in manufacturing] and away from countries such as China.”  ET Water, a maker of irrigation equipment in California, relocated manufacturing from China to the US last year. “We’ve already seen benefits through making quality improvements and finding it easier to meet orders more quickly,” said Mark Coopersmith, managing director. “In the past two years we’ve improved our margins and doubled [revenues] and a lot of this has been due to the move from China.”",©

In the context of biology, no matter what species you're talking about, if the genitalia requires fertilization then the _genitialia_ is female. _Staying within this context_, [""Female (♀) is the sex of an organism, or a part of an organism, which produces non-mobile ova (egg cells).""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female) Yet despite this, and I believe that you would agree, with respect to humans, having a vagina has no bearing on a person's gender identity. In this context they may be some degree of male and female, but that is up to something other than outward physical appearance or chromosomes, some process much more complex that we unfortunately do not yet understand.  Just because in one context genitalia is labeled as male or female doesn't mean that it disrespects or ignores the gender identity of those who possess such genitalia. Wouldn't you agree that AMAB individuals are not male to the extent that they do or do not identify as such, and the same for AFAB individuals and being female? This whole argument seems hinged on terminology. And, sometimes terminology is important. But scientific papers that, out of necessity, need to make a distinction between male and female physical characteristics in no way denigrate anyone's gender identity.  I shouldn't need to say this, but yeah I'm a trans woman and I fucking hate transphobia, but there is nothing transphobic about making a distinction between physical characteristics on one hand and gender identity on the other.",♀

I think the odds that ether or both ships were NOT guided by autopilots at the time of collision to be vary low.  Taken to it's extreme, technology like this could make a US/Israeli missile aimed at a place like, say, Tehran hit at a place like , say, Riyadh or Bagram (Yes, even the nuclear tipped ones, if their using GPS.)  My question to you is: Do you think any one has told the Israelis this?

All original film footage and film editing by Debra Fear. © 2012, All Rights Reserved.  About the song:  'Colour Blue' is dedicated to the enduring joy and love Cameron gave to his parents, unwavering many years after he has gone.  Although his time with us was brief, the effect his life had on family and friends was profound.  For me, not appreciating the full extent of his suffering, I remember only his ""beautiful"" ""blue eyes"".  His Auntie Libby remembers:  ""Baby Cameron was an angel living on Earth and is now an angel in Heaven. Everyone that came to know Cameron, cherished him. He will never be forgotten and will always be loved.""  Born with a rare genetic disorder called ""Epidermilosa Bullosa"" he endured enormous pain - every second, every day.  He was the strongest person I have ever known.  I feel joy when I think of Cameron's beautiful ""blue"" eyes, so large and deep - a window into his soul. Telling him how ""beautiful"" he was and how strong and ""brave"".  I never got to hold baby Cameron, because touching him caused too much pain.  He was physically wrapped in bandages but we emotionally wrapped him with our love.  I feel joy knowing that he will never be in pain again and that he is free to fly where-ever his heart takes him.""  http://www.debra.org.uk/ for more information on EB",©

I just bought a pretty small one that fills up nicely without needing much ganj; that can help pretty easily, and mine including shipping was ~$20.   what i do is: - break up the nugs and whatnot with my hands a bit - freeze it for at least a half hour (you can go longer but after a certain amount of time you wont get any more benefit and you're just wasting time) - grind it up to a bit of a finer grind - stick back the ground contents back in my sack and freeze for 15-35 more minutes - pour into the tray of the kief box, and shake it around with a small square cut from a gift card (a gift card is about the width of my box total so a full gift card will not move at all). the card being there helps knock extra kief off the contents, and in cases like mine were some kief sticks to the sides of the box's collection tray, the card helps knock some of that down too. (you can scrape the rest off with the card after) - rub my finger around the screen gently to push any little bits i missed through - check the tray and enjoy  note: i wouldn't check the tray too too often if you use a method like this- i get a good bit of kief each time, and the more i work towards being able to make a good little brick of hash, the more tempted i am to just get my closest frients and i baked bc i can    lastly, i apologize for ranting, but thank you /r/trees in general. the above method for using a kief box is one i made up solely from things you all told me about kiefing/kief boxes in a post i made recently. i should thank you guys there on that post, but here's also a general shoutout to the community for always helping me learn. no other community in the world is as great as the stoner community, for many reasons.  stay easy, all. much love. &lt;3 ☮",☮

t5_2qh1i,H5Mind,1348633636,"**Desiderata**  Go placidly amid the noise and haste, and remember what peace there may be in silence. As far as possible without surrender be on good terms with all persons. Speak your truth quietly and clearly; and listen to others, even the dull and ignorant; they too have their story. Avoid loud and aggressive persons, they are vexations to the spirit. If you compare yourself with others, you may become vain and bitter; for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.   Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans. Keep interested in your career, however humble; it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time. Exercise caution in your business affairs; for the world is full of trickery. But let this not blind you to what virtue there is; many persons strive for high ideals; and everywhere life is full of heroism.  Be yourself. Especially, do not feign affection. Neither be critical about love; for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment it is as perennial as the grass.  Take kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering the things of youth. Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune. But do not distress yourself with imaginings. Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness. Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself.  You are a child of the universe, no less than the trees and the stars; you have a right to be here. And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should.  Therefore be at peace with God, whatever you conceive Him to be, and whatever your labors and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life keep peace with your soul. With all its sham, drudgery and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful world. Be careful. Strive to be happy.   **© Max Ehrmann 1927**",©

t5_2us65,KatelynLinker,1348664811,"I chose the Leukemia and Lymphoma society as the business I wanted to evaluate. They are obviously a medical business, but they still have to make arguments for patients to use their services and for people to donate. The first thing you will read on their “About LLS” page is that this society is “the world’s largest voluntary (nonprofit) health organization dedicated to funding blood cancer research and providing education and patient services.” This initial statement combines the use of evidence and values. They state the fact/statistic that this society is the world’s largest organization dedicated to this cause which seems to give it some credibility. Also, but adding that it is a nonprofit organization, they are hinting at the values associated with working for a good cause. Making money isn’t their first priority. If you read on, you will see that the society’s “commitment to cutting-edge science has contributed to an unprecedented rise in survival rates for some people with blood cancers.” This is utilizing a cause and effect type of argument. They are stating that the society’s commitment to science has caused a rise in survival rates. This implies that they have statistics and facts to back up this claim and adds to their credibility. On another part of the website dedicated to the research this society has been doing, it states that, “For more than sixty years, the Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society (LLS) has supported groundbreaking and lifesaving research.” This statement combines evidence (that they have been doing this for 60 years), values (that life saving is important to them), and credibility (making them seem trustworthy). Their arguments aren’t typically based on testimony, but they are always based on facts and hinting at values. People will trust this society because it is working for a good cause and keeps the values of the patients and donors in mind.

We are learning more and more about how to enable  regenerative abilities in humans.   Here is an example of recent research on regeneration.   Matrix Biol. 2010 Oct;29(8):690-700. Epub 2010 Aug 24. Extracellular matrix-derived products modulate endothelial and progenitor cell migration and proliferation in vitro and stimulate regenerative healing in vivo. Vorotnikova E, McIntosh D, Dewilde A, Zhang J, Reing JE, Zhang L, Cordero K, Bedelbaeva K, Gourevitch D, Heber-Katz E, Badylak SF, Braunhut SJ. Source  Department of Biological Sciences, University of Massachusetts, Lowell, MA 01854, USA. Abstract  Most adult mammals heal without restorative replacement of lost tissue and instead form scar tissue at an injury site. One exception is the adult MRL/MpJ mouse that can regenerate ear and cardiac tissue after wounding with little evidence of scar tissue formation. Following production of a MRL mouse ear hole, 2mm in diameter, a structure rapidly forms at the injury site that resembles the amphibian blastema at a limb amputation site during limb regeneration. We have isolated MRL blastemal cells (MRL-B) from this structure and adapted them to culture. We demonstrate by RT-PCR that even after continuous culturing of these cells they maintain expression of several progenitor cell markers, including DLK (Pref-1), and Msx-1. We have isolated the underlying extracellular matrix (ECM) produced by these MRL-B cells using a new non-proteolytic method and studied the biological activities of this cell-free ECM. Multiplex microELISA analysis of MRL-B cell-free ECM vs. cells revealed selective enrichment of growth factors such as bFGF, HGF and KGF in the matrix compartment. The cell-free ECM, degraded by mild enzyme treatment, was active in promoting migration and proliferation of progenitor cells in vitro and accelerating wound closure in a mouse full thickness cutaneous wound assay in vivo. In vivo, a single application of MRL-B cell matrix-derived products to full thickness cutaneous wounds in non-regenerative mice, B6, induced re-growth of pigmented hair, dermis and epidermis at the wound site whereas scar tissue replaced these tissues at wound sites in mice treated with vehicle alone. These studies suggest that matrix-derived products can stimulate regenerative healing and avert scar tissue formation in adult mammals.  Copyright © 2010 International Society of Matrix Biology.

I have no idea how much blending the original creator of the the coffee image did around the eyes.  It is obvious that they blurred the owl a bit.  The owl was placed over the coffee image and a screen blending mode was used.

t5_2sc3f,BeerGogglesFTW,1348753961,"I don't really know anything about Linux other than its an Open-Source Operating System.  Lets say, Valve is able to get Steam and all source engine games onto Linux (which seems to be the case)..   * Would every other game on Steam be incompatible with Linux?  * Would the Linux catalog of games need to be built from the ground up?  * And if this is a direction devs/publishers want to go, how would it effect the games? Is their more or less potential in gaming on Linux? Valve says their games run faster on Linux than Windows 7 (via Google). Is this because... Valve wants their games to run better on Linux, so they put in the dev time to make it so... or does Linux have the potential to do this for all game?  After some reading it seems when Valve started the experiment they struggled to get 7 fps with Linux on a monster rig. Now they are able to get about 15% increase over Windows 7.  Does anybody think if this takes off, Windows will flex their wallet muscles forcing games to be Windows? Does Valve have something else up their sleeves in terms of getting Windows games to play on Linux? (That can't be legal, so I'd think not)  EDIT  &gt;In the long run, Newell says, he'd like to get all 2,500 games now available through Steam running on Linux. That's a tall order, but it may just be possible if it turns out that Microsoft's proprietary technologies make for an inferior gaming platform. ®",®

Ended up sterilizing a large ladle and added the grains to a muslin bag, which I dropped into the brew kettle for awhile longer to make sure I got a good enough wash. Was pretty close on OG and FG so it must have worked.  Decided to try for a longer Primary and skip the secondary and after a month in the bottle, this stuff is pretty tasty.   Also substituted the Hard Rock Candi instead of the Liquid as my local brew store didn't have the liquid on hand. However, I can't say that has had a negative effect, the brew has been one of our most popular recent projects. ",®

I am allergic to most jewellery you'll find on the internet, so I had to make sure I could wear these things all of the time without having a swollen ear or something along those lines. I bought the supplies on Etsy, from three different sellers, and assembled them myself.  Two weeks ago, I went to have my ears pierced two extra times (the middle hole was already there, used to be a strech-thingy) and then I had to wait it out until both were healed. The one closest to my face still isn't healed, so when I go out, I put two of the ear rings in the same (middle) hole, but of course I made an exception for the photo! ;) Shouldn't be longer than a week more before the third hole can be permanently occupied with my new earring!  ###&gt;☠&lt; *Will you make some for me/sell them?*  I am planning on opening an Etsy store where I will be selling these earrings upon demand;  I will offer three things:   1) A set of three (3) separate earrings like the ones portrayed in this post  2) A separate order of one (1) earring like the ones portrayed in this post  3) Three-charm-one-earwire earring, meaning you can have the three-earring-Zoro-look while only having one (1) jewel and one actual ear piercing opening hole thingy.   (English jewellery vocabulary is unknown to me, please correct where you can!)  ###&gt;☠&lt; *What will they cost?*  They will cost €2,50 ($3.20) per piece or, in a batch of three,  ~~€7,50 ($9.60)~~ *but* with a discount so €7,00 ($9.00). The three-in-one-earring will cost around the same, but a little less,  I'm thinking €6,50 ($8.40).  These prices exclude shipping cost, which will be €2,00 ($2.60) when shipped to Belgium and €3,00 ($3.90) when shipped anywhere else.

There are five categories to choose from:  1. Domestic/Boring (Dogs, Cats) 2. Livestock (Pigs, Cows, Scootaloo) 2. Quirky, but plausible. (Aardvarks, Tortoises, Squirrels) 3. Zoologist (Lions, Bears, Wildebeests, Dolphins) 3. Impossibly awesome. (The Alot)  For these sort of discussions, I prefer numbers three and five.

Thier passion truly took off when they purchased thier first set of turntables shortly after that and brought thier love for EDM to the next level. In 2005 they made the decision to branch out and move to the great city of Seattle, and now with all their networking and connections that they have made over the years, the McFunk Brothers have quickly become a very important part of Seattle's EDM culture and scene. Between DJing and working with Seattle's top production crews to help throw some of Seattle's finest events as Audio-Driveby Entertainment, these two most deffenetly have had thier hands full. In 2007 they decided to take thier passion to an even higher level when they both decided to start producing music. Now with productions of dubstep, drumstep, house, psytrance, and everything inbetween, these brothers are quickly becoming recognized as more than just your average DJ. Now with multiple tracks under thier belts, Tom and Nick are taking Seattle by storm, destroying dance floor after dancefloor with thier unique and heavy bass music styles.

t5_2r9tk,GospodinP,1348826176,"You've had a lot of people warn against the gun, so I'll let them speak to my unease there.  I think you're probably already familiar enough with gun safety to know your own feelings about how to responsibly enjoy a firearm.  You've had a lot of people suggest sensory deprivation, and at least one suggested a knife.  I'm going to tell you now how you can use them together for some highly traditional fear play.   **Um yes, SPOILERS: if you're a fear-play sub, this could spoil a moment for you ☺**  This is a trick as old as the initiation rites in fraternal orders, but it can really chill the blood:  Bind your play partner, play the role convincingly, and reveal some terrifying-looking knives.  Have fun with it, and when you think the moment is right, blindfold her.  Continue playing with the knives, and let the sound of the metal fill her experience.  Perhaps you could press the flat of a blade against her skin, but as always be safe (she can't see where the edge is, so you'll want to make sure she can't struggle into it!).  When you're ready to terrify her, pull out a piece of ice with a good corner/edge to it, and drag it across her flesh.  Make a satisfied groan or gasp as you do so: punctuate the moment with sound!  Strike a knife so the metal rings before or after!  Have fun with it!  She'll feel the edge of something cold, and then horror of horrors she'll feel *dripping*.  There won't be any pain, but she'll be convinced that she's just been sliced open.  The confusion here can build a mindfuck to intense levels.  At this point, if all has gone well, you can really make her believe she's about to be killed.  That said, it's all in how you play it and how familiar she is with this trick and all sorts of other things.  You say you're an educator, so I probably don't need to warn you about risks of fear play.  It sounds like she came to you with an understanding of what she wants, and you can decide for yourself if a ""trick"" like this would violate her trust in any way.  ",☺

t5_2qh3p,thomaswithoutkarenin,1348828149,"Let me share something with you. Years ago, I was with this girl; the sex was ok, little intense but nothing out of normal. Then she took a bottle of water, put some in her mouth and started putting her mouth in my penis (she really didn’t suck it). She basically moved her tongue around, and circulated the water top to bottom. Some of the cool water actually leaked down to my balls, which btw, was awesome. She did that for almost five minutes, and believe me, it was the best BJ I have ever had.   It baffled me for a while, and I asked her after we finished about her technique; she said that it took some time to learn how much water to put in her mouth, but the trick is to first drink a little to cool off her mouth, and then put a little more to do the BJ. Do not put too much.  Keep trying, whoever doesn’t appreciate your efforts to give a good bj, is a completely asshole and doesn’t deserve your attention to begging with. Good luck. And ask some in return ☺ ",☺

t5_2qh16,Im_No_Expert_but___,1348875044,"Note that the previous rule was ""*without permission*"".  They were allowed to ""ask"" you for access as a precondition of employment and any number of other excuses.  If you said no, they wouldn't hire you, or could fire you, or colleges could use that as a pretext for disciplinary proceedings, etc.  The new law says they can't even ASK.  **Even for private colleges!**  They can't ask for a user name or password or any other ""social media information"", and *they can't ask you to access it in their presence, either.*  These are short, well-formatted, and easy to read:  http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201120120SB1349&amp;search_keywords=  http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201120120AB1844&amp;search_keywords=  Unfortunately they do have an exception which may or may not be big enough to drive a truck through.  You can be put in the position of having to ""prove your innocence"", where they have some *other* pretext for disciplinary actions, and then you ""voluntarily"" use your social media account to prove you weren't the second gunman on the grassy knoll or whatever.  E.g. a University says ""several students saw you drinking at a frat party and you're underage"", or an employer says ""we think you've been stealing our red Swingline® staplers"", and you aren't asked to but ""voluntarily"" access your Facebook info showing you were at your cousin's wedding instead.  Basically this *would* reset things to how they were before social media, except back then this source of information didn't exist, so now you will look guilty automatically if you don't let them pick through your exculpatory social media accounts.  Basically this just gives peons another crumb to use for the few who can afford to sue, joining sex discrimination, racial discrimination, age discrimination, etc.  The employer ALWAYS says ""no we didn't make a decision because of THAT, it was this OTHER reason"", but now if you can convince a jury, you can add ""social media discrimination"" to that.

I knew he was a bit..MRAish, but I had no idea how far he'd go.   These are his own words:  "" If we were allowed to hang the rapers &amp; child molesters it would cut down on this BS. None do it more than the Islamic world - which I assume makes it OK for liberals since their messiah openly supports &amp; funds them. Say ""No"" to violence against wopmen &amp; children by disowning a president that supports these savages with our tax dollars...not that you asked, but there are facts that have to get out there.""   And then:   "" Republicans support the rights of ALL people to live to the fullest extent of their God given talents. Who will Obama blame the recovery if we are UNlucky enough to have him for 4 more years. Ceertainly not on he, himself and the rest of his crooked henchmen. Supporting a financer of the Islamic evil, means you support the raping of women &amp; the killing of homosexuals just as Obama pays for that with our tax dollars. Vote with your brain - I know you don't support the raping or the killing as our president seems too... I love you too, of course. But we live in the real world not the land of fairies &amp; unicorns... Understand facts b4 you make accusations. That's ALL I ask... ♥""  I'm not even...I don't even understand what he's talking about, tbh. It was kind of scary.

t5_2rti0,KingContext,1348883850,"Yeah, my bad.   - from [guggenheim.org](http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/show-full/piece/?search=The%20Antipope&amp;page=&amp;f=Title&amp;object=76.2553.80)  &gt; The Antipope, December 1941–March 1942. Oil on canvas, 63 1/4 x 50 inches (160.8 x 127.1 cm). The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation,Peggy Guggenheim Collection, Venice  76.2553.80. © 2012 Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York/ADAGP, Paris More Works By Max Ernst  &gt;Max Ernst settled in New York in 1941 after escaping from Europe with the help of Peggy Guggenheim. The same year he executed a small oil on cardboard (now in the Peggy Guggenheim Collection) that became the basis for the large-scale The Antipope. When Guggenheim saw the small version, she interpreted a dainty horse-human figure on the right as Ernst, who was being fondled by a woman she identified as herself. She wrote that Ernst conceded that a third figure, depicted in a three-quarter rear view, was her daughter Pegeen; she did not attempt to identify another horse-headed female to the left.¹ When Ernst undertook the large version from December to March he changed the body of the “Peggy” figure into a greenish column and transferred her amorous gesture to a new character, who wears a pink tunic and is depicted in a relatively naturalistic way. The “Pegeen” figure in the center appears to have two faces, one of a flayed horse that looks at the horse-woman at the left. The other, with only its cheek and jaw visible, gazes in the opposite direction, out over the grim lagoon, like a pensive subject conceived by Caspar David Friedrich.  &gt;The great upheavals in Ernst’s personal life during this period encourage such a biographical interpretation. Despite his marriage to Guggenheim, he was deeply involved with Leonora Carrington at this time, and spent hours riding horses with her. As birds were an obsession for Ernst, so horses were for Carrington. Her identification with them is suggested throughout her collection of stories La Dame ovale, published in 1939 with seven illustrations by Ernst, two of which include metamorphosed horse creatures. It seems plausible that the alienated horse-woman of The Antipope, who twists furtively to watch the other horse-figure, represents a vision of Guggenheim. Like the triumphal bride in Attirement of the Bride, she wears an owl headgear. Her irreconcilable separation from her companion is expressed graphically by the device of the diagonally positioned spear that bisects the canvas. The features of the green totemic figure resemble those of Carrington, whose relationship with Ernst was to end soon after the painting was completed, when she moved to Mexico with her husband.  &gt;Lucy Flint  - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Ernst",©

t5_2qpaq,nbsdfk,1348917733,"I'll have a look around in my books. As far as I know it's legal to put as much as you want of it into food in the EU.    http://www.efsa.europa.eu/de/efsajournal/doc/163.pdf this paper by the EFSA about allowing a different crystal modification of Titandioxide, says they didn't find any toxicity even in extremely large doses of TiO2!  This paper http://nanosafety.ihep.ac.cn/2007/2007.19.pdf showed that nanoparticular TiO2 may have some adverse reactions, but that the normal &gt;100nm particles used in coatings and toothpaste have no toxicity at 5g/kg bodyweight. Which is an extremely large dose, considering that there are only a few tenth of mg in a coated tablet.   &gt;Abstract In order to evaluate the toxicity of TiO2 particles, the acute toxicity of nano-sized TiO2 particles (25 and 80 nm) on adult mice was investigated compared with fine TiO2 particles (155 nm). Due to the low toxicity, a fixed large dose of 5 g/kg body weight of TiO2 suspensions was administrated by a single oral gavage according to the OECD procedure. In 2 weeks, TiO2 particles showed no obvious acute toxicity. However, the female mice showed high coefficients of liver in the nano-sized (25 and 80 nm) groups. The changes of serum biochemical parameters (ALT/AST, LDH) and pathology (hydropic degeneration around the central vein and the spotty necrosis of hepatocytes) of liver indicated that the hepatic injury was induced after exposure to mass different-sized TiO2 particles. In addition, the nephrotoxicity like increased BUN level and pathology change of kidneys was also observed in the experimental groups. The significant change of serum LDH and alpha-HBDH in 25 and 80 nm groups showed the myocardial damage compared with the control group. However, there are no abnormal pathology changes in the heart, lung, testicle (ovary), and spleen tissues. Biodistribution experiment showed that TiO2 mainly retained in the liver, spleen, kidneys, and lung tissues, which indicated that TiO2 particles could be transported to other tissues and organs after uptake by gastrointestinal tract. © 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved. Keywords: Acute toxicity; Fixed dose procedure; Titanium dioxide; Nanoparticles; Mice     Since I could only find that TiO2 is allowed in food without limits in the EU, and studies with extremely high doses found that there was no toxicit and virtually no uptake, and that it is nearly completely insolluble.   Many coatings for industrial procession come premixed with TiO2, like Kollicoat IR white, which consists of Kollicoat IR, Kollidon VA 64, Kaolin, Titaniumdioxide and SDS.  And about the PVP: you might want to look into Copovidon (Kollidon VA 64) which is a Copolymer of Vinylpyrrolidon and Vinylacetate (6:4) that ist used in SR forms, because according to the ""Mäder - Weidenauer"" the VP gets dissolved and the VA just expands, creating pores that release the active substance in a controlled fashion.",©

t5_2qh03,JangSaverem,1348937086,"Actually I believe it comes from the fact that people will give money to ANYTHING online and Kickstarter projects are some of those things. What they dont realize is that people have taken the money and gone away with it. When someone doesnt reach their goal they keep the money and produce nothing or give a half assed project. Things that dont really deserve a huge amount somehow get popular with no merit and thus more people give more money while unpopular (by no reason other than not being noticed) get nothing. In her case she did a lot more. With the huge sum of money she got she could have been producing at a much faster rate but instead has this ""Late Fall/winter"" thing. When she needed $6k I suppose that was believable (but still a bit high in cash for that ""project"" of hers) when she got over $150k and still hasnt produced more than a couple ""ill get to it later"" updates people got mad. Then soon after she got the money she was in a room with towers of games which were likely purchased with a hefty amount of money. Games that may have nothing to do with the project. What it looked like is she just had someone use the money to buy a shit tone of game that may or may not have to do with the project [Here it is](http://imgur.com/ydCeL). Now, I suppose that could have a reason behind it but really what this all boils down to is that people dont know how to spend their money and gave a shit ton to some person online that actually has no obligation other than a Kickstarter project and a ""promise"" to do ANYTHING. What people are probably worried about or mad about is that she will either do NOTHING or produce a shitty half ass project not near meriting the money she got. ♠  If people had a brain in their head no one would have given money to her in the first place. She would probably just used the money the same way with more perks for herself and not said what was used on then produce videos that would regurgitate things from TvTropes, Blogs about feminism and the same stuff people have already heard but now said by her. It was a waste of cash in the first place but like I said, people will give their money to ANYHTING. ",♠

t5_2re2w,VicinSea,1348945690,"A few notes on thickened canned products:  ClearJel® Cornstarch is mandatory. Standard cornstarch will lose its gel in a few weeks due to the acid in the fruit.  Leave at least 1 full inch of headspace in each jar.  Use a thermometer to bring your canning kettle to 200° F. Fiddle with your stove until you can get the water to stay at that temp.   Once your water has been holding at 200° F steady for at least 15 minutes, put your jars in. Make sure you have a full inch of water over the top of the jars. Leave the jars in the 200° F water for 45 minutes. Then, remove, cool and check the seals.  This longer period of time at a lower temperature corresponds to the directions for high altitude canning. The fruit inside the jars never ""boils"" so it doesn't climb up the sides of the jars leading to a mess.  The ones you have already done should be measured into containers and frozen until you want to use them. You could reprocess them if you used ClearJel® and you don't mind very soft fruit.  Happy Canning!",®

t5_mouw,Lord_Derp_The_2nd,1348953477,"&gt;A key advance in the science of graphene came when Andre Geim and Kostya Novoselov at Manchester University managed to extract single-atom-thick crystallites (graphene) from bulk graphite in 2004.[14] The Manchester researchers pulled out graphene layers from graphite and transferred them onto thin SiO2 on a silicon wafer in a process sometimes called micromechanical cleavage or, simply, the Scotch® tape technique. The SiO2 electrically isolated the graphene, and was weakly interacting with the graphene, providing nearly charge-neutral graphene layers. The silicon beneath the SiO2 could be used as a ""back gate"" electrode to vary the charge density in the graphene layer over a wide range.  &gt;The micromechanical cleavage technique led directly to the first observation of the anomalous quantum Hall effect in graphene,[84][119] which provided direct evidence of the theoretically predicted pi Berry's phase of massless Dirac fermions in graphene. The anomalous quantum Hall effect in graphene was reported around the same time by Geim and Novoselov and by Philip Kim and Yuanbo Zhang in 2005. These simple experiments started after the researchers watched colleagues who were looking for quantum Hall effect [204] and Dirac fermions [205] in bulk graphite.  &gt;Geim has received several awards for his pioneering research on graphene, including the 2007 Mott medal for the ""discovery of a new class of materials – free-standing two-dimensional crystals – in particular graphene"", the 2008 EuroPhysics Prize (together with Novoselov) ""for discovering and isolating a single free-standing atomic layer of carbon (graphene) and elucidating its remarkable electronic properties"", and the 2009 Körber Prize for ""develop[ing] the first two-dimensional crystals made of carbon atoms"". In 2008 and 2009, Reuters (which also runs a bibliometric service Web of Science) tipped him as one of the front-runners for a Nobel prize in Physics.[206] On October 5, 2010, the Nobel Prize in Physics for the year was awarded to Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov from the University of Manchester for their work on graphene.   20 years would seem a bit of an exaggeration.  Especially considering the term Graphene has only exisited for 25 years, and we didn't begin proof of concept work on the electrical possibilities until a few years ago.  But you can try to pretend it isn't going to happen, Silicon fanboy.",®

t5_2qh1i,throwaway-098,1348955400,"Hello, I was diagnosed with schizophrenia about 10 years ago, and have had multiple serious episodes since then. My first episode was similar in character to the one you describe your husband experiencing. As things stand now, I am doing very well. I am in a wonderful relationship, have fulfilling work, many friends, and have not had an episode in several years.  As people here have said, every case is different, but I'll offer some of my experience and suggestions with the hope that they may be helpful.   First of all, there is a very good chance that when your husband is released he will not yet be well. When I was first released, I was still very delusional, though *much* better off than I had been at my admission. It took several more months of heavy meds for me to achieve something resembling 'normalcy'.  Second of all, meds suck. They really, really suck. They just suck alot less then winding up gibbering in the street and losing months and months to recovery. Ensure that your husband takes his meds, but be sympathetic that they have adverse effects. It takes a long time to find an effective treatment, and will probably require many rounds of experimenting with different drugs and dosages until he is both sane *and* comfortable.  When I was first hospitalized they put me on high dosages of several antipsychotics to get the episode under control. Once I was out, and feeling saner, I thought to myself ""Hey I got better... like I used to be! I don't need these shitty pills. I'm fine.""  And so I quit taking them. I didn't know anything about the disease at the time, and I didn't have anyone in my support network that did. The pills I was taking had me sleeping 14 hours a night, and dozing off in the middle of the day. My brain felt wrapped in cotton, there was a vague haze over everything. I didn't know that I should've stayed in a relationship with a doctor (not that I could've afforded to at that time, anyway) and worked towards adjusting my meds until they worked right. I was under the erroneous assumption that this was my prescribed ""new life"", and so I rejected the doctors and the treatment. Mistake.  I was alright for a while, kept my job, but eventually I started going off track again, cut down my hours, moved to the ghetto, eventually quit my job over some perceived slight, stopped eating, wound up crazy again. Ended up on SSI, moving to mom's, on new drugs this time. Got better. Moved back into the city, did the whole damn thing over again.  I think what finally brought me around was the third episode... you can only go for so long before denying you're sick. The third time around I ended up at my dad's house. He snuck meds into my food, and I got better. After I'd been better for awhile and decided to go back out on my own again, he broke the news to me that I'd been taking meds for months -- something which I thought I didn't need, and didn't want. I was upset for him for a little bit, but not long. I knew he was right. It also may have been luck. The drugs I received during each episode were different each time, and the drugs I take now are different from those as well. The med and dosage really depend on the individual patient.  -- and as I said, I'm doing very well now. I still have to be vigilant, and learning to accept the facts of the situation wasn't easy, but it has been worth it. Speaking as someone who's been through it, one thing that was very hard for quite a while is the memories. The things you experience during a psychotic break are not real things. They are unspeakably intense and hallucinations not merely in the 5 physical senses, but in all the subtle ranges of thought and emotion.... to experience them, they are realer than reality. They are hard to forget, and even after reaching a point where you can acknowledge they were not *real*, they stick with you as an obsessing memory, they are attractive in a way... it takes time to let them go. It takes time to rebuild, even after the meds are working. The aftermath of a break is a lonely and confusing time.  But for me, it got better. The things I wish I knew years ago were that finding the right meds and proper dosage takes a long time, and that I do need help -- I can't just grit my teeth and get through it, I need medication and a doctor's advice.  Best of luck to you both.  ☮",☮

t5_2rmg0,MedicUp,1348958200,"Phlebotomy might be a good idea if you are planning on working as an Emergency Department Tech (some EDs have their tech draw blood), but it isn't really necessary for paramedic school. (Most EMS programs rarely have their paramedic draw Vacutainers anymore because it generally many hospitals no longer accept them if they are not drawn in-house due to accreditation of samples and staff.) You'll also discover that you'll have plenty of practice inserting IVs during your clinical rotation as a paramedic student.   EKG classes may be a good idea if you find it tough to grasp concepts in anatomy. I find that the quality of EKG training is variable amongst medic programs so you might want to ask a graduate of the program you're looking at to see if they were generally prepared for EKG interpretation.  Personally I think EKG training is good to have, although you could start off with something basic like the American Heart Association [Learn:® Rhythm Adult](http://www.onlineaha.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=main.courseCatalog) online program which is generally cheaper than taking a classroom course.

t5_2sazo,TripChaos,1348959923,"Ok, finished reading the steam post.   This part suck out:  .   ""Hmm I don't think this is an issue with Dark Souls but more a small percentage of 360 controllers. It depends on where the game draw the line at walk/run when pushing the stick up.   Alot of games I can run fine with my 360 controller, but alot I get the same problem here, so it's not just Dark Souls. Apparently you can click in on the left stick to fix it for a short while? (just read this before, haven't been home to try, apparently you don' have to hold down, just click once).   I beleive some 360 controllers the joystick maybe slightly off center meaning it does not move up as far as it should. If I go into the controller settings in windows and move the stick right up I notice the wee X does not hit the top of the box like it does moing it the other directions.    Two ways to combat this I think those of us with the ♥♥♥♥ty controllers can either:  a: use software to slightly adjust the maximum distance for the joystick to have to move up to hit full range   b: unscrew the controller and just file down the top of the casing enough to be able to move the stick up just that litle bit more     Anyway I could be wrong but this is the impression I have. I remember having this problem with my same controller with a few other 3rd person games in the past.   What im saying is don't rage quit dark souls just yet, I don't think it's the games fault. If what I read is correct and all it takes is a click on the left stick then it won't really matter anyway. I look forward to going home and trying it.""  .  So you claim of Dark Souls requiring people to file down their controller is bullshit. I g2g but will be on later. ",♥

t5_2ugo7,ripster55,1348969667,"Actually I'm a bit late.  Sept 20th is the verified date.  http://digitallife.today.com/_news/2012/09/20/13989898-the-emoticon-is-30-years-old?lite   &gt;Many people have denounced the very idea of the smiley face, pointing out that good writers should have no need to explicitly label their humorous comments. Shakespeare and Jonathan Swift and Mark Twain got along just fine without this. And by labeling the remarks that are not meant to be taken seriously, we spoil the joke. In satirical writing, half the fun is in never being quite sure whether the author is serious or not.  &gt;To a large degree, I agree with these critics. Perhaps the E-mail smiley face has done more to degrade our written communication than to improve it. But in defense of the idea, let me say two things:  &gt;First, not all people who post on boards have the literary skill of Shakespeare or Twain, and even those luminaries had bad days. If Shakespeare were tossing off a quick note complaining about the lack of employee parking spaces near the Globe Theater, he might have produced the same kind of sloppy prose that the rest of us do. Besides, Shakespeare’s work is full of clichés and his spelling was atrocious. :-)  &gt;Second, and more important, these authors were publishing their words in a different medium, with different properties. If 100,000 copies of a novel or an essay were distributed in printed form, and if 1% of the readers didn’t get the joke and were outraged at what they had read, there was nothing these clueless readers could do to spoil the enjoyment of the other 99%. But if it were possible for each of the 1000 clueless readers to write a lengthy counter-argument and to flood these into the same distribution channels as the original work, and if others could then jump into the fray in similar fashion, you can see the problems that this would cause. If the judicious use of a few smilies can reduce the frequency of such firestorms, then maybe it’s not such a bad idea after all. Again, we’re talking here about casual writing on the Internet, not great works printed in one-way media that relatively inaccessible to the general public.   💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩  (*☻-☻*)  :-( ",💩

t5_2srnv,ForgottenPhoenix,1348972793,"Based on your other responses and the fact that you are getting dense, fast growing culture with normal colony growth, I have a strong suspicion that it is a contamination issue. Something else that is resistant to AMP may be growing in your media.  You can test this fairly easily though:  - Do a quick and dirty miniprep without the kit and without adding RNAse([protocol here^♦ ^see ^below](http://hg.wustl.edu/hdk_lab_manual/plasmid/plsmid05.html)).  Once you purify the plasmid, run it uncut on the gel.  Typically, both RNA and DNA will be quite bright on the gel ([something like this](http://i.imgur.com/4JPzn.jpg)); however, IF you have a contamination with something else, RNA will be a LOT brighter and the DNA bands will be fairly weak because you will have very low yield of plasmid^♦♦ .     If you see that on the gel, it is a tell-tale sign of a contamination; and since you are taking all the precautions, its possible that the stock cells are contaminated.  ♦ Increase the centrifugation time for steps 5, 6 and 7 to 5 minutes each. Also, it is critical that you omit the addition of RNAse in step 8 otherwise this won't work the way we want it to. Resuspend the pellet in TE and run a small aliquot (5ul should be enough) on the gel.  ♦♦ Since contaminated cells will still release RNA and won't have the plasmid, we can exploit this. I have seen this happen before in a contaminated culture and if you want to post a gel picture (or PM me a link), I can look at it and let you know.  Also, if you have another culture that is known to give normal plasmid yields, use the same method to purify the plasmid so that you can compare them side by side on the gel.  The reason it works this way is because the cells that have plasmid grow slower than the ones without plasmid, therefore, the ratio of the cells in the media is skewed against the cells containing plasmid.   I hope this helps.  Feel free to message me if you need any clarification or have further questions.     ",♦

t5_2rm65,catlaw,1349018833,"Greetings that are friendly, aspiring clickclacker! Please tell us more about your primary uses and intentions for your new bundle of mechanical joy? Is there a conscious reason why you are going with ""browns""? Have you had an opportunity to try different keyswitches in person?  I've had a fantastic experience with elitekeyboards.com, both service and quality-wise. I have the Leopold Tenkeyless Otaku with blues and ♥ it so much! I like that clicky (both tactile and sound-wise) experience, which is why I went for blues. I do lots of heavy typing, content creation, and some gaming!  If you aren't fixated on browns, one of the best deals out there right now in a ""my very first mechanical keyboard"" vein is the [Cooler Master Storm QuickFire Rapid with blues](http://www.amazon.com/Cooler-Master-Storm-QuickFire-Rapid/dp/B0068INSUM/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1349018648&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=quickfire+rapid) — also tenkeyless and floating around $65 at Amazon. (The current branding is also less intrusive than those pictures on the page, they should update that.) Let me also note Amazon has a superb return policy and if you decide it isn't right for you, send it back.",♥
