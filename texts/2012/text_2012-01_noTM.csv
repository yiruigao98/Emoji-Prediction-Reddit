I'm of the opinion that many of the people who have supported the actions of the US Congress in the past ten years are *dangerous* in terms of defending our own liberty and freedom.  Paul Ryan has been a lockstep partisan through executive cover-up after cover-up and that is why he has no ability to hold Obama accountable.  He **voted** for the bills deferring the *Constitutional Responsibilities* of the Congress.  Surely Mr. Zerban recognizes that the people of Wisconsin deserve *competing* plans so that the best plan wins.  What solutions has Mr. Ryan offered to the Republican Party while Obama has been in charge?  Makng Obama look bad?  Putting Newt Gingrich or Mitt Romney in charge?

I hope they move on and do the Saudi lobby, which is probably more dangerous to the United States than the Israeli lobby."" - Ex-CIA official  They were already halfway to being given the state of Israel by Britain, the holocaust was not the cause of zionism and probably weakened the state of Israel of a few million citizens it would have had. Israel is an insignificant country 0.0001% of the world's land and 0.0005% of the population, the attention it gets is [mostly due to antisemitism like this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saqr_Abu_Fakhr) that has been steady throughout the last 2 milennia and used as a scapegoat for all the problems in the world.  &gt;no one dared to discriminate against them again.  That's blatantly false.   *Antisemitism was commonly used as an instrument for personal conflicts in Soviet Russia, starting from conflict between Joseph Stalin and Leon Trotsky and continuing through numerous conspiracy-theories spread by official propaganda. Antisemitism in the USSR reached new heights after 1948 during the campaign against the ""rootless cosmopolitan"" (euphemism for ""Jew"") in which numerous Yiddish-language poets, writers, painters and sculptors were killed or arrested. This culminated in the so-called Doctors' Plot (1952–1953). Similar antisemitic propaganda in Poland resulted in the flight of Polish Jewish survivors from the country.*  *After the war, the Kielce pogrom and ""March 1968 events"" in communist Poland represented further incidents of antisemitism in Europe. The anti-Jewish violence in postwar Poland has a common theme of blood-libel rumours.*  &gt;A March 2008 report by the U.S. State Department found that there was an increase in antisemitism across the world, and that both old and new expressions of antisemitism persist.  It's really obvious you know little of history so perhaps you should stop speaking about it with such biased assumptions. You don't have to have an opinion on everything and usually it's best to keep quiet on subjects of ignorance or you make yourself look foolish.  ✡✡✡✡✡✡✡✡✡✡✡✡✡",✡

Well then, if we emphasize faith, does this mean that we can forget about the law? Of course not! In fact, only when we have faith do we truly fulfill the law. Abraham was, humanly speaking, the founder of our Jewish nation. What did he discover about being made right with God? If his good deeds had made him acceptable to God, he would have had something to boast about. But that was not God's way. For the Scriptures tell us, ""Abraham believed God, and God counted him as righteous because of his faith."" When people work, their wages are not a gift, but something they have earned. But people are counted as righteous, not because of their work, but because of their faith in God who forgives sinners.",©

Place scotch bonnet pepper on top of liquid and cover tightly for 30 minutes or until rice is cooked. Remove scotch bonnet pepper before serving.  You can change it up a bit by cooking the onions and garlic + diced jalapeno (use scotch bonnets at your own risk) and then use fresh thyme.. a few whole sprigs can be tossed in the removed before serving.

The original founders of BlackRock were Laurence Fink, Ralph Schlosstein, Robert S. Kapito, Susan Wagner, Bennett Golub, Barbara Novick, Keith Anderson, and Hugh Frater.

t5_2s4uu,kindofstephen,1325713533," **Cetaphil Daily Facial Moisturizer SPF 15**  **The Claim**  A facial moisturizer plus moderate sun protection, all in one.  Cetaphil® Daily Facial Moisturizer SPF 15 is specially formulated to be effective, light and silky-smooth — ideal for facial use. In addition to providing gentle moisturization for all skin types, Cetaphil® Daily Facial Moisturizer SPF 15 gives you moderate protection against damaging UVA and UVB rays that are responsible for premature lines and wrinkles. This skin moisturizer is lightweight, fragrance-free and suitable for use under makeup or after shaving.  **The Ingredients**  Active ingredients: avobenzone 3%, octocrylene 10%  Water, diisopropyl adipate, cyclomethicone, glycerin, glyceryl stearate, PEG-100 stearate, polymethyl methacrylate, phenoxyethanol, benzyl alcohol, acrylates/C10-30 alkyl acrylate crosspolymer, tocopheryl acetate, carbomer 940, disodium EDTA, triethanolamine.  (Listed in decreasing quantity)  **The Cost**  $2.64 US per fluid ounce on Amazon  **What is it?**  Cetaphil Daily Facial Moisturizer SPF 15, is a moisturizer with a texture designed for the face with chemical sunscreens and an antioxidant – making it a day time moisturizer.  Avobenzone and Octocrylene are chemical sunscreens. Avobenzone is a UVA sunscreen, unfortunately in the presence of UV light avobenzone can degrade and release free radicals in the skin. The addition of Octocrylene, however, can stabilize and prevent avobenzone from degrading. Octocrylene on its own is a UVB  sunscreen, however it can penetrate the skin and release free radicals.  Diisopropyl adipate acts as a solvent and moisturizer.  Cyclomethicone and Polymethyl methacrylate act as emollients. Cyclomethicone, which is a silicone, will smooth the skin and provide that soft, velvety texture to the skin. Polymethyl methacrylate is an acrylic polymer, it helps the product apply more smoothly and feel smoother – like the cyclomethicone.  Glycerin acts as a humectant. As a hygroscopic ingredient, glycerin can attract moisture from the atmosphere and bind it in to the skin. Over time glycerin will increase the moisture in the skin. While it is water soluble, high concentrations of glycerin in products can make it sticky and leave your skin shiny.  Glyceryl stearate, PEG-100 stearate,  acrylates/C10-30 alkyl acrylate crosspolymer and carbomer 940 act as thickeners. These ingredients are responsible for the thickeness and texture of the product. Glyceryl stearate and Peg-100 stearate also do double duty as emulsifiers – they keep oil ingredients like Avobenzone and Octocrylene from seperating from the water.  Phenoxyethanol and Benzyl alcohol act as preservatives reducing or stopping the growth of bacteria and fungi.  Tocopheryl acetate or Vitamin E acts as an antioxidant. Vitamin E is an oil soluble antioxidant and will reduce free radical damage caused by UV exposure. However Tocerphyl Acetate is an inactive version of Vitamin E, a study showed that it did not provide immediate antioxidant activity in the skin, but over a period of 5 days it increased levels of active Vitamin E in rat skin about 5%.  Disodium EDTA acts as a chelator. Chelators bind to metal ions which can be present in water. These metal ions can encourage bacteria growth, and they can also react negatively with certain ingredients such as Avobenzone. Avobenzone can bind with iron ions and stain clothing.  Triethanolamine is an alkaline pH modifier. Triethanolamine also functions as a surfactant/emulsifier, but since its the last ingredient it’s likely at very low levels, possibly a 1/10th of a percent which makes its use as a pH modifier more likely.  **The Match Up**  “A facial moisturizer plus moderate sun protection, all in one.” Yup! Cetaphil Daily moisturizer contains emollients like silicone which will instantly make your skin feel smoother, and moisturizers like glycerin which will over time bring moisture to the skin and the sunsreens avobenzone and octocrylene for UVA/UVB protection.  “…effective, light and silky-smooth” Yup! By changing the percentage of thickeners used, a chemist can make a product thicker or lighter. A thicker product doesn’t mean it’s more moisturizing though, even though it may feel that way. The silky smoothness from this product is from the Cyclomethicone and Polymethyl methacrylate  “…gentle moisturization for all skin types” Yup! Glycerin is a great moisturizer for people with dry skin, and oily skin as it is water soluble. A small percentage of people may find that they are allergic to it, but it is quite prevalent in moisturizers.  “…moderate protection against damaging UVA and UVB rays that are responsible for premature lines and wrinkles” Uhh. With Avobenzone covering the UVA spectrum (320 to 400 nm) and Octocrylene covering the UVB spectrum (250 to 320 nm), Cetaphil Daily Moisturizer does provide full spectrum protection. However both of these ingredients are not as effective in the middle of the spectrum around 320 nm. There is also the issue of Avobenzone and Octocrylene releasing free radicals in the skin, which can damage to the skin’s cells. The product does include Tocopherol Acetate, which acts as an antioxidant, but the activity of Tocopherol Acetate may not be strong enough to counteract the free radicals generated from the sunscreens. Better antioxidants to have included would have been green tea extract (ECGC), or even lycopene – which is deposited by the body in to the skin to provide UV protection.  “…fragrance-free” Yup! No fragrance in here.  “…suitable for use under makeup or after shaving.” Yup! The cyclomethicone might actually make your makeup application smoother by acting as a primer. And for freshly shaved skin, glycerin can sometimes cause stinging, but will help return moisture to the skin.  **The Verdict: Match!**  Cetaphil Daily Facial Moisturizer SPF 15 is a good moisturizer for someone who doesn’t have many skin issues. It does provide moderate UV protection, and is broad spectrum – though there are better choices out there. The chemical nature of the sunscreens means that it can generate free radicals in UV light, and the one antioxidant in the product may not be enough to counteract them.  The main moisturizing ingredient in the product is glycerin, which is widely used and very cheaply acquired. The cyclomethicone and  Polymethyl methacrylate give your skin a smoother feel, but won’t do much in terms of long term improvement of the skin.  If you’re looking for something very basic, non-oily and not likely to cause acne, that only provides moisturizing benefits to the skin, with some SPF for daily use, this product will do that. It would be best to layer an antioxidant rich product, such as a gel or liquid, under this moisturizer. ",®

t5_2rlua,thomasapage,1325781126,"Firstly, thank you so much for asking for feedback on this.  I can imagine everybody has their opinions on this you’re a brave and diligent soul for opening the floor.  Bravo!  IF you wish to make the unmodified version of each weapon the best for balance across recoil, accuracy and stealth (I'm not saying I agree this is a good idea, players do have to work to unlock them after all), then logically every attachment MUST have a downside as well as a benefit.  Any attachment which is purely beneficial will render the unmodified weapon inferior overall.  The downsides (and sometimes benefits) of a given attachment in real life obviously cannot always be accurately represented in the game (weight of the weapon, cumbersome long barrels in tight spaces etc) so it's not unreasonable that, in the name of balance, these downsides be represented in another way as close as possible to reality within the confines of the game-play.  Again, my observations are made on the assumption that an unmodified weapon play the role of balanced jack-of-all-trades.  Suppressors:   As I understand it, in reality suppressors are rarely used in open combat because (a) they have limited benefit when using supersonic rounds and (b) they make the weapon slightly longer and more cumbersome.  Using subsonic rounds will have implications for the range and penetration of your weapon, but you will be silent.  I love the way stealth is represented in game via the effects on the minimap and audio, and it feels to me like the downside of subsonic ammunition can be represented well with penalties to range and/or power at range (although I wouldn’t like to put a figure on by how much myself).  I'm not sure why accuracy comes into the equation really, unless it is designed to represent the extra weight on the muzzle?  Seems unnecessary.  Foregrip:   Again, as I understand it, in reality use of a foregrip is largely down to personal preference.  A large number of people claim their accuracy in some circumstances is increased and the weapon more comfortable to handle.  Others dislike it and claim it is a clumsy addition when prone, it is however generally acknowledged to be a benefit.  Increasing unaimed accuracy seems a great way of representing the improved handling of the weapon, the issue is picking a suitable in-game downside to what is essentially a good thing!  The idea that using a foregrip prevents the use of auxiliary weapons like the M320 is, I think, an excellent one, although whether or not this is a sufficient downside I do not know.  The idea of penalizing aimed accuracy is a logical counterpart to the increased unaimed accuracy, but probably has little basis in reality.  Bipod:  Honestly I have little experience with this attachment.  The few times I have used it my experience has reflected the numerous comments on here about it being too much of a pain to deploy.  The benefits are I’m sure excellent, but the deployment issue kills it for me.  Could it not automatically give benefit when prone?  Flash suppressor:  As has been mentioned several times, in reality this is pretty much standard on most weapons.  If it must be included in as an upgrade (which I have nothing against really) then perhaps making it an early upgrade with relatively little effect on performance outside of reduced visual signature.   Heavy barrel:  I agree, the existing recoil penalty seems harsh, your suggested amendments sound good.  Laser and tac light:  Generally great as they are, although the tac light perhaps a bit too effective on broad daylight  ☺  Again, many thanks for this.  There must be a thousand other things you have to take into account that we never even think about.  So it’s great to see someone so committed to listening to the players. ",☺

Considering all the use and abuse they have suffered in 300 years, the fact that some of them can still sound sensational is a testament to their craftsmanship.  To me, violins are like cars. Let's say a great Strad or Guarneri = Ferrari. Any one can pull a Ferrari out of the driveway. The Ferrari isn't going to make you a better driver at all.

She and I sat next to each other every school day until the day we graduated. We lost contact for many years after graduation as we each grew in our own ways.. but I have never forgotten her. When I had my breakdown a few years ago, I reached out to her and like every time I have asked for help.. and she did not hesitate. She talked me down from some scary places (I know because I have saved every chat log from those times to help remember why I transitioned) and for that I am forever grateful (and I tell her that as often as I can).

Another one you want to look at is the 600 G (60mT) which is the legal limit of gauss that someone is allowed to be exposed to in an 8hr day. But after those points you start to get into the range of shits flying around the room.  But yeah your mom will on and average day not come into contact with any of these unless she is working in a industrial area or a lab.  Also you could just not tell here that you turned it off one night so that when she says it prevents her from sleeping that its really not.   ACGIH threshold limit values for continuous exposure to static magnetic fields Abbreviations used in this table: G – Gauss; a unit of magnetic field intensity, equal to 0.0001 Tesla mT – millitesla T – Tesla; magnetic field strength is measured in Tesla TWA – time weighted average  Note: 1 Gauss (G) = 0.1 millitesla (mT) 5 G (0.5mT)	Highest allowed field for implanted cardiac pacemakers 10G (1.0mT)	Damage to watches, credit cards, magnetic tape, and computer disks 30G (3.0mT)	Kinetic energy hazard from small ferrous objects 600 G (60mT)	Allowed TWA for routine exposure (whole body) (8-hour TWA*) 6000 G (600mT)	Allowed TWA for routine exposure (extremities) (8-hour TWA*) 20,000 G (2T)	Whole body ceiling limit (no exposure allowed above this limit) 50,000 G (5T)	Extremity ceiling limit (no exposure allowed above this limit) * TWA exposure time is normally a concern only for extremely high field exposures to the whole body. 1 2003 TLVS® and BEIs® based on the ""Documentation of the Threshold Limit Values for Chemical Substances and Physical Agents &amp; Biological Exposure Indices,"" ACGIH Worldwide, p. 142",®

Just forcing your vocals into a gritty loud sound. I guess that doesn't really help much. Well I look forward to hearing your finished version of the pop punk dude 😄,😄

From the comments here: http://campaign2012.washingtonexaminer.com/blogs/beltway-confidential/did-ron-paul-just-win-iowa/289986 *(Read that ☺)*      &gt; Well two things.      &gt; The state was blackmailed into the fact that is Ron Paul won they would take the First in the Nation rights away from them.      &gt; There are still 25 delegate positions available. There is a very good chance that a majority of these delegate positions will be for Ron Paul. That would beat Romney and Santorum by more than 10 delegates POSSIBLY.     &gt;  This was a victory tonight. Compared with the results from last year this was a true victory. There are plenty of other states and if we can get California then we can get Ron into the White House.  &amp;     &gt;  I am proud of all the rePaulicans out there as well.

An “OEM” license is a license distributed by an Original Equipment Manufacturer, or an “OEM.”  An OEM is a person or company who builds and sells computers.  Some OEMs also distribute software, especially operating systems such as Microsoft® Windows.   **What is the difference between OEM product and Full-Packaged Product (FPP)?**   ANSWER.  OEM products are intended to be preinstalled on hardware before the end user purchases the product.  They are “shrink wrapped” and do not come in a box like the retail products do.  Full-Packaged Product (FPP) is boxed with CD(s), manuals, and the EULA and is sold in retail stores in individual boxes.  The End User License Agreements (commonly referred to as “EULAs”) for OEM and FPP products are slightly different.  One main difference is that an OEM operating system license (such as the license for Windows) cannot be transferred from its original PC to another PC.   However, the FPP version of Windows may be transferred to another PC as long as the EULA, manual and media (such as the backup CD) accompany the transfer to the other PC.  Also, when a customer purchases an OEM product, the OEM license requires the OEM to provide support for the product.     ",®

LOL Other than the typical stuff like, be tolerant &amp; accepting of everyone's differences, never make fun of anyone for any reason, don't be rude etc. Pretty much anything that falls in line with growing into a self sufficient adult.  My kids are responsible for: waking up on their own (since about age 10) with an alarm (I'm always up as back up)  They clean up; One's chore is to do dishes, one has to sweep &amp; steam mop the floor, nd on garbage day, they both take the garbage up front to the pile. The 2 older ones (13 &amp; 15) do their own laundry, they clean their room twice a week, clean out the tub when they're done showering (so it doesn't get yucky build up)  3 nights a week they make dinner for their little sister (2) and clean up while I take their other little sister (5) to dance classes.  They do have cell phones with the $35 unlimited prepaid plans, nothing fancy.. if they want  fancy phone, they buy it themselves. My oldest just saved up for an android phone. When I have it, I give them money to go to games (sports) or to the movies maybe once or twice a month)  They are expected to make good grades. Anything on their report card under a 90% isn't acceptable and they will lose privileges (phone &amp; internet time usually) until next report card. They have a 8pm curfew on school nights, 10pm on weekends. Usually on the weekends or when I have off, they'll watch their sisters so I can sleep for a bit. I work 3rd shift, so I run on very little sleep! I try to sleep during the day on the sofa while my 2 year old plays around. I get up to feed her lunch and then lay back down. So, usually on a Saturday morning they'll get the girls up and make them pancakes and entertain them. They do this 100% on their own... They're such good kids ♥  I get a lot of flack from my sister in law who's kids are 12 and 15. They are left to do whatever they want - no rules at all. They're allowed to pick the slacker classes in school, never do home work, I see them up at 1am on facebook on school nights, their room is a disaster etc. etc. etc. So, I'm viewed as a ""nazi"" because I try to be the parent, not the BFF. My kid are happy though. I grew up having my grandmother wait on me hand and foot, so I was 24 (when she died) before I learned to wake up on my own or do much of anything really. Also, when we were off at my dad' for the weekend, it was a free for all - The only rule was that we couldn't drink his orange juice. Bad news! I had learned a lot of life's lessons the hard way.

t5_2qstm,eazy_,1326303250,"There is a pretty cool loophole in the FICO® credit scoring models that give consumers a “free pass” if they want to shop around for auto and mortgage deals. Here’s how it works: If an inquiry occurs because you applying for auto or mortgage credit (and yes, FICO knows), for the first 30 days that inquiry won’t count at all. After 30 days pass, the FICO scoring model will look to see if there are other auto or mortgage inquiries. If there are multiple inquiries for those types of loans within a 14-day time frame, those multiple inquiries will only count as one inquiry in your score. There are even newer versions of the FICO scoring software that will count auto and mortgage inquiries within a 45 day period as one inquiry in your score. But, to be safe, do your shopping in a 14 day period. Not all lenders are using the most up-to-date FICO scoring software.  [source](http://www.credit.com/rs/vol17.jsp)",®
t5_2qi4s,Koss424,1326308759,"an interesting comment on the subject.  Link can be found below.  'Which is correct as the plural of LEGO: 'Lego' or 'Legos'? Neither, actually. The word 'LEGO', when used as a noun, should only refer to the company that makes the product. Otherwise 'LEGO' is supposed to be used as an adjective. Thus, when referring to the pieces, neither 'lego' nor 'legos' is correct... rather one should say: 'LEGO bricks' or 'LEGO pieces' or whatever (using LEGO as an adjective -- and one should really capitalize all of the letters, and put the little 'circle-R' symbol after it (®)). This is all a matter of protecting the trademark of 'LEGO' for the company (using it otherwise degenerates the strength of the trademark). This is not to say that I use the word correctly 100% of the time... but that's the answer to the question (it's always fun/painful to read the near-flame-wars that start at slashdot.org over this topic... and generally, both sides are wrong).

This is not hype; this is the first time in history that you, the homebuyer, has access to active GTA for-sale residential listings from the MLS®. Think of realtor.ca but with real time updates, and up to 120 more datapoints for the listings. This came about because of the infamous back and forth argument between Toronto Real Estate Board and the Competition Bureau.   We are a tech company at heart. Yes we are a real estate broker and a proud member of CREA, BUT the information that is on the site can be accessed for FREE, without contracts. You do have to sign up (TREB rules) which takes less than 30 seconds, but rest assured this is a BIG, BIG, win for Canadian homebuyers.

You may be able to find a very nice, affordable double edge razor there without breaking the bank.  Something in the $10 to $15 range isn't unheard of, and as long as any mechanisms on the razor work, they're well worth the money. There are a few razors which are sold new in that price range as well, although they're not as nice as some of the $30 range razors.

t5_2qhq6,PrincessSparkleslut,1326335986,"My top suggestions for you:  Vinyasa, Anusara, Jivamukti, and perhaps Ashtanga. General vague Yoga could also be very good. If you want to stay away from fast-paced so you can work on correct alignment to better support yourself than I'd stay away from Bikram, Baptiste, Corepower, and Power Yoga. For Now.   Ultimately I'd say that your concerns about the extra weight and the faster pace are probably for naught. I've had lots of bigger students before and they had no more issues than anyone else. If you were to venture into those classes it would likely work out just fine (especially if you had a good knowledgable teacher) but if you're more comfortable starting slower - then by all means do that. It's your practice and you should feel comfortable, safe, and taken care of.  There's also classes and styles sometimes that cater to the overweight. If you can find them it sounds like you might really like those. They focus a lot on safety and the needs of larger students. [Curvy Yoga](http://www.curvyyoga.com/) has some resources online that you might be interested in if you wanna go that route.

t5_2qhq6,PrincessSparkleslut,1326349749,"Yoga CAN help with weight loss. I've known people that completely changed their bodies with just yoga. That said - it can, but don't count on it. It will happen for sure, but I wouldn't outright *suggest* yoga for it's weight loss abilities. Usually one of the major ways yoga helps that is by making you more aware of your body and what you put in it (and how much you put in it). So your nutrition gets a little better plus you're being active in a hopefully challenging way.  Lots of people like that Bikram helps them lose weight each class, but most of the time (not always) it's primarily water weight they lost from all the sweating and it'll come right back. But the work is also hard so that does contribute to long term fat loss and strength gain.  What would probably help you the most is getting more muscle. Whether through yoga which I think is the **best** way or through weight training. Either way - muscle weighs more than fat, *but* it also burns fat off your body much quicker. So you not only get leaner faster, but you get a nice shape from the muscles to eventually reveal once some of the fat goes away. (that felt like a tangent sorry)  If you do want to utilize yoga for weight loss I'd increase your practices to like 5 times a week if possible.   Hope this info proves remotely useful ♥",♥

Average serum estradiol concentrations (Cavg) vary by product  Oral: Femtrace®: Cavg: 23.5-92.1 pg/mL  Injection: Estradiol valerate and estradiol cypionate are absorbed over several weeks following I.M. injection  Topical:  Alora®: Cavg: 41-98 pg/mL  Climara®: Cavg: 22-106 pg/mL  Divigel®: Cavg: 9.8-30.5 pg/mL  Elestrin®: Cavg: 15.4-39.2 pg/mL; Exposure increased by 55% with application of sunscreen 10 minutes prior to dose  Estraderm® 0.1 mg/day: Cavg: 73 pg/mL  Estrasorb®: Mean serum concentration on day 22 of therapy: ~35-65 pg/mL; Exposure increased by 35% with application of sunscreen 10 minutes prior to dose  Estrogel®: Cavg on day 14 of therapy: 28.3 pg/mL  Evamist®: Cavg: 19.6-30.9 pg/mL  Menostar®: Cavg: 13.7 pg/mL  Vivelle-Dot®: Cavg: 34-104 pg/mL  Vaginal: Femring®: Rapid during the first hour following application, then declines to a steady rate over 3 months; Cavg: 40.6-76 pg/mL  Distribution: Widely distributed; high concentrations in the sex hormone target organs  Protein binding: Bound to sex hormone-binding globulin and albumin  Metabolism: Hepatic; partial metabolism via CYP3A4 enzymes; estradiol is reversibly converted to estrone and estriol; oral estradiol also undergoes enterohepatic recirculation by conjugation in the liver, followed by excretion of sulfate and glucuronide conjugates into the bile, then hydrolysis in the intestine and estrogen reabsorption. Sulfate conjugates are the primary form found in postmenopausal women. With transdermal application, less estradiol is metabolized leading to higher circulating concentrations of estradiol and lower concentrations of estrone and conjugates.  Half-life elimination: Femtrace®: 21-26 hours  Time to peak, plasma: Oral: Femtrace®: 0.4-0.75 hours  Excretion: Primarily urine (as estradiol, estrone, estriol and their glucuronide and sulfate conjugates)  **PK ADME info taken from Lexi Comp**  I'm a pharm student.   If you're really interested in each specifics I suggest you just google the product and read the actual package inserts.

t5_mouw,thefalcone,1326429925,"&gt; The claim that only Dr. Das had access to his computer which was in his locked office. In fact, Dr. Das claims the chief informant in this case, whom the university does not reveal, also had a key to Dr. Das’ office. Dr. Das asserts his office was not private and “anyone could use it.”  • The university’s report stems from a paper published in a 2008 issue of Free Radical Biology &amp; Medicine, a peer-reviewed journal. Why did the university choose to wait three years to publish these allegations that were refuted by Dr. Das over two years ago? No retraction of that published report was called for at that time.  • Dr. Das was blind-sided by the university, being completely unaware of the release of these allegations to the news press. Dr. Das had to be informed of the negative news reports by his colleagues. He was prevented from making a timely response to all of these charges. The news press reports Dr. Das did not return phone calls, which is pejorative, as he was away from his desk and was not monitoring his calls.  • The University of Connecticut report alleges Dr. Das “defunded” the work of a student in his lab because she did not produce results that he wanted. Investigation into this matter shows that Dr. Das “defunded” the work of this researcher from his budget because she was devoting all of her time to another researcher in the same laboratory, who turns out to be the informant or “whistle-blower” in this case, the very same person who also had a key to Dr. Das’ office.  • Another student researcher who worked in Dr. Das’ laboratory in 2008 discloses that the informant in this case was a trouble maker who chased away many other researchers by intentionally causing friction in Dr. Das’ lab. The former student says the university informant in this case even attempted to “pour wine down her mouth,” hoping to get her to reveal negative things about Dr. Das. The student says she did not witness any scientific irregularities in Dr. Das’ lab during her tenure there, which included Western Blot tests that were alleged to be doctored.  • Another party, a university internal investigator whom Dr. Das accuses of long-standing prejudice against foreign-born researchers, reportedly broke the lock on Dr. Das’ office door, removed computer files and personal items such as bank records and a passport, and could have manipulated data in his computer files. Dr. Das says this university investigator has had a long-standing vendetta against him going back to 1984.  • Dr. Das says he has not personally conducted laboratory bench tests for many years now and that his students and other subordinates conducted all the tests, including the allegedly doctored Western Blot tests. Even if doctored and inaccurate, these tests in no way invalidate the many health claims associated with resveratrol, a red wine molecule. Dr. Das says most of his work has been corroborated by other researchers including his important finding that resveratrol protects the heart against damage prior a heart attack.  • While the news media made quick association between Dr. Das and a particular brand of resveratrol pill he has tested, Dr. Das has no commercial relationship and does not serve as a paid consultant to any manufacturer of resveratrol pills. He served as an unpaid expert for an online interview of a particular brand of resveratrol, a pill that his laboratory found to be superior to plain resveratrol in laboratory studies. A spokesman for that company, Bill Sardi, managing partner for Resveratrol Partners LLC, dba Longevinex®, says his company has donated product to researchers including Dr. Das’ lab and has underwritten some of the expenses involved in conducting tests, but no researchers have received pay offs or have personally profited from their studies involving his product. Mr. Sardi says his company has not sought to influence the outcome of any independent or sponsored studies. Resveratrol Partners LLC is a private company based in Las Vegas, Nevada.",®

It says, ""Absorption: The Climara transdermal delivery system continuously releases estradiol which is transported across intact skin leading to sustained circulating levels of estradiol during a 7-day treatment period. **The systemic availability of estradiol after transdermal administration is about 20 times higher than that after oral administration.** This difference is due to the absence of first pass metabolism when estradiol is given by the transdermal route.""  In the description, ""Climara ® , estradiol transdermal system, is designed to release estradiol continuously upon application to intact skin. Six (6.5, 9.375, 12.5, 15, 18.75 and 25 cm 2 ) systems are available to provide nominal in vivo delivery of** 0.025, 0.0375, 0.05, 0.06, 0.075 or 0.1 mg respectively of estradiol per day**. The period of use is 7 days. Each system has a contact surface area of either 6.5, 9.375, 12.5, 15, 18.75 or 25 cm 2 , and **contains 2, 2.85, 3.8, 4.55, 5.7 or 7.6 mg of estradiol USP respectively**. The composition of the systems per unit area is identical. ""  Ugh I can't find something online that you can see easily that I can see. Anyhow what you're looking for it looks like is ** BIOAVAILABILITY.** Absorption greatly affects bioavailability and then I'd have to teach you all the aspects of pharmacokinetics but thats not a strong point of mine. However, if you look above at the bolded thats all you need to really know. It's much harder to find exact numbers as most are buried within papers of research that cost money to find out.   You could probably derive it if you got PK skills, but PK was one of my weakest areas so I can't help that much. ;/   I found it funny that in the Climara patch it says you get higher Cmax and Cavg if you put it on your butt.

For example, the fifth partition on the first slice on the third disk is /dev/ad2s1e.  That's the old MBR + BSD disklabel stuff.  These days GPT is often preferred, especially if combined with ZFS.  Also if you have an AHCI-capable or Marvell SATA controller, you'll want their specific drivers (ahci/mvs) which are considerably simpler and more performant.  This gives you names like /dev/ada2p5.  Of course, if you're sensible you'll use one of the many ways of labelling disks/partitions/filesystems.  ♥ [GEOM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GEOM).",♥

t5_2qh0u,drakeg4,1326514342,"As someone completely foreign to the Sonic and Zim fanbases, I can't state their reason for being fans but I do sub to /r/mlp and /r/pokemon, mostly because of the community. I haven't actually played pokemon in years and haven't actually seen the TV show since Gen1 but I still have a fascination with it and the community is generally pretty interesting, the fan created artwork can get pretty stunning as well. As for /r/mlp, I thought it was pretty damn strange at first but I figured there had to be a reason for the popularity so I gave it a chance, sat down and watched i think 5-6 episodes (can't judge a show based on 1-2 episodes). It was fun to watch. It isn't Citizen Kane, it isn't the second coming of FSM, it was just generally fun to watch. As an aside, I watch a lot of Pixar and Dreamworks films so I guess I have a predisposition to enjoy animation. Anyways, MLP doesn't have world class art direction, the plot isn't super deep, and the characters are all pretty archetypal but it has a charm about it that is hard to describe. I just enjoy watching it. I don't have a victim complex, I'm usually pretty tongue-in-cheek about how I like a ""girls cartoon"". I'm pretty sure the folks at /r/mlp could tell you the same thing. Though this may be specific to the mlp community for the sole reason that the shows central tenant is tolerance. Hell, here is a quote from the FAQ  &gt;I'm sorry, I didn't like it.  &gt;It's okay! We all like different things and that's what makes us great as individuals. We respect your opinion of not liking it, all we ask for is that you respect ours as well for enjoying it. Just because we don't like the same thing it's not a reason to start hating each other.  Also,  &gt;I could go into a Sonic Forum, clearly, concisely point out why many of the modern sonic titles are bad games, and be flooded instantly with claims of me being a troll.  This points to me as strange. Why would you go to a forum for a fanbase and tell them why they shouldn't like something? Why would anyone outside of any community walk in and tell them why you think their community sucks? Obviously they have found something in it that you haven't.  Lastly yes, there is a plethora of shitty art. This doesn't even apply to fanbases, this applies to the entire planet. Most people suck shit at art, but they still want to show it off for some reason. Just look at all the shitty pics of random things taken on iPhones and filtered through some app and posted onto Facebook. Good artists are a minority but you can't judge a community based on the quality of the artwork. My favorite webcomics (xkcd, Cy&amp;H, and Scandinavia vs the World) all use extremely simplistic graphic to tell a message. But you know what? There is also dresden codak, a true artist among webcomic makers. Does the simplistic artwork of xkcd and Cy&amp;H take away from the quality of dresden? Not for a second. Nor do his amazing skills take away from the quality of humor of the simpler comics. DA is just a giant aggregation of images that people have created and when you get so much content, almost all of it will be shit (man this is sounding more and more like a critique of Reddit). If you don't like the art, there is a back button on your browser.  TL;DR Communities are based around the strengths of the subject, not its weaknesses. Do you think there would be fans of anything if they just brooded on the faults of their particular brand of fandom? There are people with victim complexes, some more vocal than others but trust me, no matter the community, most of the members are normal, average people like you and me.

t5_2qj8f,Gantrof,1326519564,"This comment certainly makes me curious about Marketplace's methods.  &gt;It's rather pathetic when you can't trust a consumer advocacy program to be straight with its viewers. I'm in no position to judge the accuracy of all the revelations, [but simply by following the link to the study Marketplace commissioned](http://www.cbc.ca/marketplace/includes/2012/episodes/whatfx/images/coldfx_metaanalysis_2011nov09.pdf) one can find a much more nuanced verdict on the efficacy of Cold FX. To begin with, the scientist didn't do an independent search of the literature in case there were other studies of Cold FX out there. He only analyzed the four submitted to him by Marketplace. Let's assume those studies are representative. What the scientist found on duration and severity was not ""evidence of absence"" (of effects, or ""FX""), as Marketplace revels in claiming, but absence of scientifically adequate evidence. More specifically, he found a modest benefit for Cold FX compared to placebo, but not a statistically significant one (as he did for cold frequency). In the case of duration, two of the four studies were eligible, and the subjects who took cold FX enjoyed about 2 and 3 fewer days of illness, respectively. Marketplace wilfully neglected to point this out to viewers and to explain that in clinical research an effect is conservatively deemed to be no effect at all (i.e., possibly due to chance) if the statistical odds of it being due to chance are greater than just 5% or 1 in 20. When it came to the effect on cold duration, the odds were borderline significant: 6% or about 1 in 16. To put it another way, the odds of Cold FX's clinical advantage over placebo being real were 16 to 1 - respectable odds in real life, but not quite good enough in cautious science. Marketplace viewers should have been told this. Scientists consider results like this to be suggestive and a sign that more research - which enhances the capacity to establish a statistically significant effect - are justified. In the case of severity, the benefit from Cold FX (compared to placebo) was about 30% in one study and nearly 20% in the other eligible study. Once again, the effect wasn't statistically significant, but in real world terms the odds were 10 to 1 that the effect was real. Perhaps most telling is how the scientist commissioned by Marketplace concluded his paper:  ""In summary, these results support the effectiveness of COLD-FX® for preventing colds. There is insufficient evidence of a reduction in severity or duration of colds.""  I've never used Cold FX (always seemed overpriced to me). This is just me - an occasional medical journalist with an understanding of clinical research - being royally POed (again: the hatchet job on homeopathy was the last example) by the irresponsibility of a public broadcaster's program manipulating viewer sentiment for a good story at the expense of public education.

So, they use the word _automatic_ too, and don't say manual.

t5_2qi6d,movzx,1326589835,"Let's see...  After taking the MSF course I decided I definitely wanted a bike. I browsed CL forever and decided to give this one bike a ride.  On my first test ride I:   * ☑ Couldn't get it into neutral after stopping at a sign   * ☑ Stalled the bike multiple times   * ☑ Had problems shifting   * ☑ Had to do a multiple point turn in order to turn around  The very first turn out of the neighborhood where I bought the bike:   * ☑ Went up onto the median between both lanes of traffic  After making it home and riding the bike to other places:   * ☑ Stalled all the time (later determined to be an electrical issue)   * ☑ Scraped the shit out of my engine guards on curbs from doing very wide U-turns   * ☑ Still went up on a curb occasionally from my wide U-turns  That was three or four years ago. I still make mistakes, everyone does. I was teaching my buddy to ride in a flat, open field. He was just standing there, straddling his bike... And he dropped it. It scared him much like you're worried now. If someone tells you they've never dropped, much less stalled, their bike they're a fucking liar.   Don't hop into traffic. Ride it around the neighborhood, ride it on empty roads. Ride it until you feel comfortable. You didn't just hop in a car and get into rush hour. You learned to drive and worked your way up.  Couple of words of advice... You'll probably notice that your hands are very sore after riding. This is because you're using a death grip. It's a perfectly normal reaction to the activity you're doing. It *will* pass as you learn to not be afraid on the bike.  Don't rely on your mirrors 100%. They're very small. Learn to use your head to check around you. Unlike a driver, you have an unobstructed view of anywhere you can look. Use this to your advantage.",☑

A:  Our founder, Truett Cathy, made the decision to close on Sundays in 1946 when he opened his first restaurant in Hapeville, Georgia. He has often shared that his decision was as much practical as spiritual. He believes that all franchised Chick-fil-A® Operators and Restaurant employees should have an opportunity to rest, spend time with family and friends, and worship if they choose to do so. That's why all Chick-fil-A Restaurants are closed on Sundays. It's part of our recipe for success  The religious roots of this company would be hard to break. As much as a chicken biscuit would be awesome on a Sunday morning, its just not going to happen.",®

To be an 'official' librarian she'd have to get a master's degree, but many people have long, happy careers without the degree. As for wages, I have the MLS (Masters in Library Science) and I work in a special library, so I make decent (yet not fantastic) money. I would be content to have this job and this pay scale the rest of my life. People in school libraries or public libraries often make less money, but it can still be enough to live on. In my opinion, she wouldn't be destitute, and if she was happy with her job, that is worth a lot in itself! She should definitely check it out. Becoming a librarian was the best choice I ever made.

Next point I'll make, the current site you see at http://tf2r.com/ is dead development, what you see there is 3 months old code which we haven't touched and is to be replaced by what we're working on at http://dev.tf2r.com/ which is a completely new rollout of code, layout and styling (oh my god it's darker and has more contast!).  Last point, a large amount of raffles made on the site are private, on the ratio of public to private there are at least 20 private raffles to every 1 public raffle made so adding captchas to public raffles ONLY honestly wont make much difference, plus it had already been approved via poll to add them. I hate captchas myself but if it can improve the quality of the site then fine by me and a lot of others share my view on this, the captcha as well wont be some insane reCAPTCHA ""how the fuck do I read this shit"" it'll be a completely different system which is easier to understand but while at the same time being just as secure against JS based bots.

t5_2qlqk,shallah,1326748095,"Dow Chemical is seeking USDA approval for a genetically engineered (GE) version of corn that is resistant to 2,4-D, a herbicide that was used in the formulation of the highly toxic defoliant Agent Orange.  Agent Orange (half 2,4-D by composition) was extensively used in Vietnam by the military to destroy forests and crops.  Dow’s Christmas gift for America was formally announced, by the USDA, in the December 27, 2011 edition of the Federal Register.  If the federal government wants to bury something in the news, and burn up part of our window to publicly respond, you can bet they’ll do it around the holidays.  The public has 60 days to comment on Dow’s petition for deregulation, and can do so online at:  http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=APHIS-2010-0103-0001  Weeds are increasingly adapting to Monsanto’s genetically engineered line of crops that rely on the use of a different herbicide, glyphosate, which Monsanto markets as Round-up®.  This is leading competitors, like Dow, and proponents of GE agriculture to look for weed killing alternatives.  Herbicides more toxic than Round-up® appear to be next up in the pipeline.  2,4-D, a systemic herbicide, is used on many types of broadleaf weeds.  It is a chlorinated phenoxy compound that has caused serious eye and skin irritation among agricultural workers.  According to information compiled by Cornell University, rats fed 2,4-D produced “fetuses with abdominal cavity bleeding and increased mortality.”  And 2,4-D may cause infertility, birth defects, organ toxicity and neurological effects.",®

t5_2qh2z,giantsparklerobot,1326841220,"That article has some problems because it doesn't bother mentioning radiative surface area. A fictional spaceship that wants to effectively radiate heat from it's internal machinery needs to maximize it's radiative surface area and minimize it's receptive surface area. I'll try to illusted this with ASCII below:                          (ship)                          |____ --&gt;     ☀ - (sunlight) -&gt;   |____ --&gt; (radiation)                          |____ --&gt;  In my crappy illustration above our space ship has a receptive surface area of 3 units but a radiative surface area of 9 units. Assuming some sort of perfect conduction our ship can radiate three times as much energy as it receives from the star. If the ship generates twice as much heat as it receives from the star it should be able to radiate all of its heat away so it doesn't melt into slag. The sunward side of the ship can furl radiators and close insulated and reflective doors to absorb as little sunlight as possible and the dark side can unfurl radiators and open up the insulated doors to radiate like a son of a bitch.  Now most sci-fi ships don't take this sort of design into account so they have roughly the same sized area receiving sunlight as they do radiating it back into space. Ships look cooler when they aren't practically designed. However space is pretty damned cold and heat will flow very quickly in a shadowed area because the differential between room temperature (~300K) and empty space (~3K) is huge.  That's not necessarily to say the link is *wrong* but not as accurate as it could be. You would not want to be caught unprotected in the shadow of something in space, you'll get really cold really fast.",☀

He's the one who's supposed to be in control. However, discussing things with him is a great way to lay out how you want this new direction to unfold. Challenging one's Dominant is something i think we all do; i do it when i feel i'm not being controlled tightly enough and He knows when i do it, how to ramp things up for me. It's normal, it's natural, and it's probably expected.

Blending action and survival horror, this latest instalment in the multi-million selling franchise is the most ambitious, immersive and feature rich title of the series to date and promises to be the dramatic horror experience of the year.

Kennedy, but when the venue suffers a bioterrorist attack, Leon is forced to face a President transformed beyond recognition and make his hardest ever decision.

t5_2s3yz,neguohsi,1327016895,"Just remember that other people want to talk to you because they like you and like being around you - you have valuable things to say. Even if it seems scary to talk to people in case you mess up, they will always be understanding since they're the ones initiating conversations with you.  Here are some really good ways to become comfortable talking to people: 1. Talk to people who you know are more awkward or shy than you. Since their comfort level is lower than yours, you have the upper hand and can control the conversation. Additionally, you can be sure that they're more worried about themselves and how they sound than they are about how you sound or act. To them, you might be the coolest guy ever! 2. Talk to waiters/servers/cashiers/etc. briefly whenever you need to speak to them. For example, when buying groceries, you can make a comment about the weather or the delicious dinner you're going to cook. Casual, offhand remarks make for very brief conversations - just long enough to scan, pay, and bag your items. Don't forget to say thanks and have a nice day! Everyone appreciates that. 3. Try to ask a lot of questions about the other person. Being a good listener really makes people feel at ease and takes the burden of controlling the conversation off of you. Everyone likes talking about themselves!  Don't worry too much - I used to do the same things as you (I'm a girl btw). Social interaction is all about feeling casual and as though your interactions aren't the epitome of life. If you mess up, play it off with a joke or just ignore it and remember to correct yourself next time. Good luck! I believe in you! ♥",♥
t5_2sgq6,NinjaofLove,1327016916,"All of the Bioware games I've played should carry the Burger King slogan: ""Have It Your Way®.""  No matter what choice you make, good or evil, you're still a rock star who can bang chicks/guys and save/conquer the world. You're glorified no matter what you do. The only thing that suffers if you choose evil is your character's complexion, and the only motivation for being a bad guy is to see how the alternate bad guy scenes play out. To me, this win-win binary model is boring, lazy and unrealistic.   If you go into a prison and interview any inmate, they won't tell you that they were straight A students who one day decided they wanted to be evil to see how things would play out differently. In reality, they probably came from broken homes, were abused, beaten, neglected, etc.  I can't even be bothered with these games anymore. The industry keeps insisting that this is rich, immersive, top notch story-telling, but I think anyone who's ever read a book, watched a good movie... or lived a little would feel otherwise. ",®

t5_2qi58,zSolaris,1327064326,"============= Neuer =============  = Ramos = Vidic = Thiago Silva = Lahm =  === Schweinsteiger ==== D. Fletcher ===  = A. Valencia ==== Rooney ==== Bale =  =========== Van Persie ===========   Bit of an explanation:  * Neuer is a crazy German keeper. And them Germans don't like you scoring on them. He's a brick wall and can launch counterattacks by throwing the ball past the halfway line. * Ramos I picked because he's usually a solid defensive right back. Don't need him to really bombard up the pitch since he won't have the ball often but need him to be solid in defense. * Vidic and Thiago Silva. Does this need to be explained?  * Lahm was picked because he is also a solid fullback while offering a little bit of attacking threat. Could be useful supporting Silva down the left. * Schweinsteiger because every team needs the Pig Climber©. * Darren Fletcher. When he's healthy and in form, he has the ability to take care of some of the best midfielders in the world. His presence and industry were sorely missed by United in both UCL finals.  * Antonio Valencia. He's like a Theo Walcott who can defend and cross properly. Has ridiculous amounts of speed but is also as strong as an ox. Excellent man for when you need a swift break or for when you need to sit deep and defend. * Rooney playing the trequartista that he so excels at. Provided that he doesn't loose his cool, he is perhaps one of the most complete forwards in the game. That is, he can defend, he can win the ball, he can run, he can shoot, he can head it in. Perfect for a game where you will need to sit deep and wait for that one or two chances. * Bale here for more or less the same reasons as Valencia. Good in defense, high work rate, and ridiculously good at counter attacks. * Van Persie. When you need a man to score off of one attempt on goal (or zero), no one is better than RVP. ",©

I used Fuerte style, and basically just used my old mini-mash container (5 gallon gatorate cooler with a paint strainer bag).  I added the 500g mate, then recirculated about 3 quarts of 170F water through it for about 10 minutes.

t5_2rjo5,mrbabymanv4,1327231123,"Are you using a Mac or a PC?  Do you have a suitable microphone?  What is the model of this audio interface you have?  I think you might have an Avid® Recording Studio. This is not ideal if you want somewhat professional sounding stuff, but it is adequate to learn on before you go ahead. It has a built in-preamp on one of its inputs.   **SOUND SOURCE**  An input is where you can plug a sound source into, such as microphones, synths(input 2), electric guitars (with DI box). BTW I am assuming you are a beginner to all this. We will go through the signal chain to give your an understanding on how to get a decent sound.  **PREAMP STAGE**  With your microphone plugged in and a signal passing through, it must first go through the preamp in order to ""boost"" the low signal into a stronger, louder signal. A good preamp which can gain a signal well improves the signal chain drastically. Ones to look out for are FMR RNP and GAP PRE73.  **COMP**  This can be added if you get an external preamp. Makes loud parts softer. People use this to attenuate high amplitude signals by a certain ratio, than gain the overall signal to make signal seem louder. Not always necessary in studio recording. Look out for FMR RNC.   **A/D STAGE**  This stage is where the analogue signal gets ""turned into"" digital data that your computer can read. Your interface has built in AD, but it is not of the highest quality.  **DAW STAGE**  Into your DAW or sequencer. This is where you get to see your recorded signal as a waveform. I do not use ProTools SE, but it should be fairly easy to record and sequence with one you get past the learning curve. If not, people who use reaper rave about its ease of use.  **D/A STAGE**  Digital back to analogue so your monitors (speakers) can output your processed signal (Can use unprocessed signal if experiencing lag when recording).   If you are trying to get a good sound, have a good signal chain. For now, you can buy a SM57 or 58, you will need one of these anyways, they are cheap, built well and nice for recording instruments and male vocals.  Connect this to your audio interface with a balanced XLR microphone cable to your main input.  Connect your speaker system to the outputs (don't buy new speakers yet). If using RCA or unbalanced keep the cable lengths short, or pickup hum and buzz.  Connect interface to PC via usb (not a big fan of this, but usb2 speeds should be okay).  Install the drivers for your interface.  Next step is to set up your DAW. Reply back if you have questions for this.   If you are thinking of upgrading later, I set up a friend's bang for buck setup with a SM57s/SM7 -- GAP pre73(used) -- FMR RNC -- RME fireface400(used- got it for a steal)  -- to his PC -- bm6a. He has recorded himself and some bands with this setup, and is very happy with the results. Upgrade based on your needs though, don't get caught up in buying shit and then never acquiring the expertise to use it well (I feel this happens a lot).  Good luck mate.",®

t5_2qmg3,JohnMaddenNovelty,1327268340," **John Madden Halftime Report**  Brought to you by *Butterball* © *turkeys*  Both teams have had plenty opportunities to score, and neither have outperformed this half. The second half will be especially hard for the Ravens because of this crowd. It is a sold out crowd and they are really getting into it. Of the fifty-two states in this country, this one has one of the loudest stadiums in Gillette. The goal for the Ravens in the second half is to quiet the crowd quick with some solid defense and some scoring by Joe.  Speaking of Joe Flacco, he is having a game. There have been some mistakes, but he is showing that he is better than people give him credit for. He threw for 162 yards in 16 attempts. Almost 70% passing. He is trying to score touchdowns so he can get points and lead his team to the Super Bowl. In order for the Ravens to continue to ball so hard, they need to play football hard. Scoring is the key, and Ray Rice needs to step it up and help out in that department. Ray Rice only has 21 yards in 10 carries.   Rarely is the question asked, 'is our Patriots winning?' This is because the Patriots have Tom Brady. The first half of this match he threw for 146 yards. 14 out of his 24 attempts. It's a little under 60%, which is lower than Flaccos 70%. He also threw one interception. If he wants to lead his team to the Super Bowl, Tom cannot throw interceptions. He needs to complete passes and not drop the ball. Hernandez and Welker both have over 40 yards, which is good, but they both have 4 and 3 receptions respectively. Tom needs to find his top receivers if he wants to keep his small lead.   The Ravens have to turn this game around 360 degrees if they want to get a better outcome. The best way for them to do this is to play solid defense, score when they are on offense, and make no mistakes. They are only down 3 points, but against the Patriots, you need to have more points if you want to win. ",©

[Pimento Cheese Sandwich Filling](http://www.publicradio.org/columns/splendid-table/recipes/condiment_pimento_cheese.html)  From What We Eat When We Eat Alone by Deborah Madison and Patrick McFarlin. Copyright © 2009 Gibbs Smith.  ""Mother would take blocks of American cheese, jars of Miracle Whip, and cans of pimentos, sit under the post oaks and grind them together with a clamp-on-the-table meat grinder."" That's how pimento cheese was made in Patrick's family. This version started out pretty much the way Patrick's mother's did, with pimentos and mayonnaise but Cheddar and Jack rather than American cheese. Then, feeling the pimentos were not as tasty as they once might have been, we switched to thick, jarred Spanish peppers and bolstered the mix with smoked paprika, along with plenty of pepper and a little mustard. The resulting cheese, in our assessment, can be addicting, whether on a cracker or in a sandwich.""              8 ounces aged Cheddar cheese, yellow, or white and yellow mixed     1 (4 oz.) jar of pimentos     2 tablespoons mayonnaise, more or less     2 teaspoons mustard     1 teaspoon sweet or hot smoked paprika     lots of freshly ground pepper     1 sliced scallion  Grate the cheese on the coarse holes of a grater or run it through a meat grinder if you still have one. Stir in the peppers, mayonnaise, mustard, and paprika, tasting and adjusting as you go. Finally season with plenty of freshly ground pepper and add the scallion.  ",©

Greenwald has [the goods:](http://www.salon.com/2011/12/31/progressives_and_the_ron_paul_fallacies/singleton/)  &gt;The fallacy in this reasoning is glaring. The candidate supported by progressives — President Obama — himself holds heinous views on a slew of critical issues and himself has done heinous things with the power he has been vested. He has slaughtered civilians — Muslim children by the dozens — not once or twice, but continuously in numerous nations with drones, cluster bombs and other forms of attack. He has sought to overturn a global ban on cluster bombs. He has institutionalized the power of Presidents — in secret and with no checks — to target American citizens for assassination-by-CIA, far from any battlefield. He has waged an unprecedented war against whistleblowers, the protection of which was once a liberal shibboleth. He rendered permanently irrelevant the War Powers Resolution, a crown jewel in the list of post-Vietnam liberal accomplishments, and thus enshrined the power of Presidents to wage war even in the face of a Congressional vote against it. His obsession with secrecy is so extreme that it has become darkly laughable in its manifestations, and he even worked to amend the Freedom of Information Act (another crown jewel of liberal legislative successes) when compliance became inconvenient.  &gt;He has entrenched for a generation the once-reviled, once-radical Bush/Cheney Terrorism powers of indefinite detention, military commissions, and the state secret privilege as a weapon to immunize political leaders from the rule of law. He has shielded Bush era criminals from every last form of accountability. He has vigorously prosecuted the cruel and supremely racist War on Drugs, including those parts he vowed during the campaign to relinquish — a war which devastates minority communities and encages and converts into felons huge numbers of minority youth for no good reason. He has empowered thieving bankers through the Wall Street bailout, Fed secrecy, efforts to shield mortgage defrauders from prosecution, and the appointment of an endless roster of former Goldman, Sachs executives and lobbyists. He’s brought the nation to a full-on Cold War and a covert hot war with Iran, on the brink of far greater hostilities. He has made the U.S. as subservient as ever to the destructive agenda of the right-wing Israeli government. His support for some of the Arab world’s most repressive regimes is as strong as ever.  ☹bama is an insane disaster that no supporter can defend and for whom no informed voter could bring him/herself to cast a vote.",☹

Perhaps others have also misread my concluding remarks in this entry. What I suggest is that some parts of the profiles could apply to most people, a characteristic shared by other kinds of readings such as astrological or psychic readings. I do not claim that any profile, taken as a whole, will fit most people. I am not suggesting that one type fits all. Since the various profiles are based on information the client has provided, they shouldn't be telling the customer anything about himself that he doesn't already know. Thus, just as psychics have many satisfied customers because they feed back to clients what the clients have told them, and they make claims that could apply to most people or that most people would want to be true, so too do Myers-Briggs folks have many satisfied customers. In any case, those who read the above article carefully recognize that the main problem is not with the accuracy of the profiles but with the way they are abused by employers and others.

t5_2tf16,mpiet14,1327330275,"*Abstract:*    **Background:** Malignant brain cancer persists as a major disease of morbidity and mortality in adults and is the second leading cause of cancer death in children. Many current therapies for malignant brain tumors fail to provide long-term management because they ineffectively target tumor cells while negatively impacting the health and vitality of normal brain cells. In contrast to brain tumor cells, which lack metabolic flexibility and are largely dependent on glucose for growth and survival, normal brain cells can metabolize both glucose and ketone bodies for energy. This study evaluated the efficacy of KetoCal®, a new nutritionally balanced high fat/low carbohydrate ketogenic diet for children with epilepsy, on the growth and vascularity of a malignant mouse astrocytoma (CT-2A) and a human malignant glioma (U87-MG).   **Methods:** Adult mice were implanted orthotopically with the malignant brain tumors and KetoCal® was administered to the mice in either unrestricted amounts or in restricted amounts to reduce total caloric intake according to the manufacturers recommendation for children with refractory epilepsy. The effects KetoCal® on tumor growth, vascularity, and mouse survival were compared with that of an unrestricted high carbohydrate standard diet.    **Results:** KetoCal® administered in restricted amounts significantly decreased the intracerebral growth of the CT-2A and U87-MG tumors by about 65% and 35%, respectively, and significantly enhanced health and survival relative to that of the control groups receiving the standard low fat/high carbohydrate diet. The restricted KetoCal®  diet reduced plasma glucose levels while elevating plasma ketone body (β-hydroxybutyrate) levels. Tumor microvessel density was less in the calorically restricted KetoCal® groups than in the calorically unrestricted control groups. Moreover, gene expression for the mitochondrial enzymes,  β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase and succinyl-CoA: 3-ketoacid CoA transferase, was lower in the tumors than in the contralateral normal brain suggesting that these brain tumors have reduced ability to metabolize ketone bodies for energy.   **Conclusion:** The results indicate that KetoCal® has anti-tumor and anti-angiogenic effects in experimental mouse and human brain tumors when administered in restricted amounts. The therapeutic effect of KetoCal® for brain cancer management was due largely to the reduction of total caloric content, which reduces circulating glucose required for rapid tumor growth. A dependency on glucose for energy together with defects in ketone body metabolism largely account for why the brain tumors grow minimally on either a ketogenic-restricted diet or on a standard-restricted diet. Genes for ketone body metabolism should be useful for screening brain tumors that could be targeted with calorically restricted high fat/low carbohydrate ketogenic diets. This preclinical study indicates that restricted KetoCal® is a safe and effective diet therapy and should be considered as an alternative therapeutic option for malignant brain cancer.",®

[Arkansas, Article 19](http://www.arkleg.state.ar.us/assembly/Summary/ArkansasConstitution1874.pdf) [page 63/81]:  ""No person who denies the being of a God shall hold any office in the civil departments of this State, nor be competent to testify as a witness in any court.""  [Maryland, article 36, 37](http://www.msa.md.gov/msa/mdmanual/43const/html/00dec.html):    That as it is the *duty* of every man to worship God in such manner as he thinks most acceptable to Him, all persons are equally entitled to protection in their religious liberty; wherefore,   - no person ought by any law to be molested in his person or estate, on account of his religious persuasion, or profession, or for his religious practice, unless, under the color of religion, he shall disturb the good order, peace or safety of the State, or shall infringe the laws of morality, or injure others in their natural, civil or religious rights;   - nor ought any person to be compelled to frequent, or maintain, or contribute, unless on contract, to maintain, any place of worship, or any ministry; nor shall any person, otherwise competent, be deemed incompetent as a witness, or juror, on account of his religious belief;   - *provided, he believes in the existence of God*, and that under His dispensation such person will be held morally accountable for his acts, and be rewarded or punished therefor either in this world or in the world to come.  That no religious test ought ever to be required as a qualification for any office of profit or trust in this State, other than a declaration of belief in the existence of God.  (Formatting and emphasis mine)  [North Caroline, article 6](http://www.ncleg.net/Legislation/constitution/article6.html):  The following persons shall be disqualified for office:   First, any person who shall deny the being of Almighty God.  ...  Anyway, you get the point. People who do not believe in the existence of The Almighty God® are, in some states, forbidden to participate in a major part of society: holding public office, regardless of the public's interest.

t5_2qh16,hostergaard,1327427174,"&gt;What? I don't want to be strict: pirates don't produce anything, period.  No, but what you want is irrelevant. Hollywood does not produce anything in the sense that they not make anything physical and necessary to our survival. But if you take the more than just that into consideration you will also have to accept that pirates provide knowledge and spread information to people who would otherwise not have gotten it.    To understand how invaluable this is you must understand the value of free flow of information. When we see a revolution in knowledge, the reaching of this new level is always closely tied to information being more freely available.   &gt;First, ""helping"" someone against their wishes is wrong,   No, its not wrong if it also helps others that want and need the help.   &gt;second, Hollywood can exist without pirates, but pirates can't exist without Hollywood. This is the flaw in your analogies. That these analogies are accurate in different ways doesn't negate this fatal flaw that makes the relationship parasitic.  False, this is the flaw in *your* analogies. Pirates would exist irrespective of Hollywood. They do not need Hollywood, pirates exist because there is a flawed and obsolete system in place, as such they will exist as long as this system is in place. Now, this system is in part enforced by Hollywood so in that respect pirates exist because of Hollywood. But people will always share regardless of law. Its more accurate to say that Hollywood is the parasite, or the sickness, pirates are simply an evolutionary response.   There is two truths; people want to produce knowledge and people want knowledge.  Now, Hollywood produces knowledge, put they only provide it to a limited amount and limits people ability to get it. Pirates are a simple necessity arising from the need for knowledge. People will always want knowledge, and whoever try to stop them from gaining it will sooner or later be crushed.   One of your problems is that you cannot think outside your indoctrinated box that say that you can own knowledge. Before it was true that knowledge was limited, its spread was costly and difficult, but reality have changed. Adapt or die.   &gt;False, that's not how copyright works. Educate yourself. It is how patents work, but MAFIAA and their laws are not concerned with patents in the slightest.  True, its how copyright works, if I produce a work identical to another I cannot publish it regardless. Educate yourself and post your own opinion instead of a large text that you think is too long for me to bother with.  &gt;False, copyright doesn't prevent you from creating something if your inner self is ""tainted"" by certain experiences, you are being ridiculous.  Again you fail to understand the argument. As child I watched Mickey Mouse. I grew up with Disney. Now, my basis for creativity is derived from Disney. To use the article you provided, no movie, book, image song or is free of ""Color"". When someone make a story they use the experience they have, the things they learned to create the story. The bits are all colored and rearranged. And I cannot express them because they are colored.   For example, I think up my own movie with Mickey Mouse. But Mickey is copyrighted. So I have to either not use Mickey at all, which leave me with an imperfect presentation of my thoughts and ideals or I have to not do it all. So I cannot express myself to the fullest, my freedom is limited and for that alone we should cast of the shackles of copyright.  &gt;There are edge cases, like, at some point a fanfic (which is allowed) can turn into blatant retelling of the original, but I don't see how the existence of such edge cases can be used to defend torrenting a video without any changes whatsoever.  No, these are not edge cases. This the very core of the problem. Or one of them at least. That I cannot freely express my toughs.   &gt;How a new model is ""better"" if it can't rise to prominence on its own, without requiring the old model to be utterly destroyed first? Why don't you start your own recording label that uses a ""better"" business model and outcompete the existing labels? Why in order to ""compete"" do you need to destroy them by changing legislation in a way that violates the idea that they are based on, that if a customer doesn't agree to your price, they don't get the goods? If customers can use your stuff regardless then it's no longer a Free Market, you know.  Because is not allowed to rise on it own, the old system is trying legislate it away. All I ask is that we remove legislation that favor one system over the other. Because the idea the legislation are based on are no longer true.  Its no longer the free marked when you have to create laws that prevents certain system from existing.  Its quite simple, copyright is an extension of the idea of ownership. The idea that comes from the fact we both cannot have that rock at the same time. So we make rules as to when and why we can have that rock. But this fundamental truth is no longer true for knowledge. We both can have that rock at the same time. We can have as many of them as we wish for no cost.   An items cost is derived from the labor it takes to produce and the resources it takes to produce it. But its worth is derived from the availability, and the availability is infinite in this case.   No matter how much money and time someone uses to produce something it gives them no right to profit from it. You could spend billions painting the moon but I would still not give you dime for looking at it. You could produce all the oxygen you want but you are not entitled to money for it.   Its a simple reality that things can be copied in endless amounts.  Its very idea they are based on that is wrong. We don't need it, why should we try to legislate it away and sacrifice our freedom for something that is no longer necessary.  The point is that I want Free, but we no longer need Market. We don't need it anymore, you know.  &gt;Then why don't you buy a single book, a single song and a single movie and ""consume them ad infinitum"" instead of pirating?   But I do. I have lots of books I read again and again.  &gt;Oh wait, there is a fundamental difference between consuming identical loaves of bread every day and consuming identical copies of a book. It's a fundamental property of information, in fact, that copying a number doesn't produce any information (which is why copying is free). My analogy is correct, yours is wrong.  No, buddy, your analogy is incorrect, its mine that is valid. Consuming identical books or bread is the same, the problem the same. It will nourish you, but it will end up stale and boring the long run. Copying will create information by spreading it and thus let it evolve.    Instead of only Bread© and Bread With Raisins© we can have thousands of variations that will emerge when we release it from the shackles of copyright.   &gt;I gather that you might be very surprised by the suggestion that it's you who doesn't understand at all how information is different from physical objects, and not the people who you usually accuse of that, those pesky proponents of ""artificial scarcity"". Well, you really have been wrong all this time, deal with it.  I find it sad that you are so blind to simple reality and dismiss it with ridicule because it threatens your obsolete worldview.   &gt;Ha ha ha, dude, really. We are talking about music and movies.  Yes, that we are, you should have remembered that before you started talking about bread and bakers.  ",©

Edit: this seems to sum it up, don't know the source though:  &gt; Lift Fan Inlet:  The lift fan inlet doors were changed from a bi-fold, side-hinged configuration to a single, aft-hinged door. The change added some weight, but significantly reduced lift fan flow distortion, which increased lift fan performance and operability.  &gt;Auxiliary Inlet:  The auxiliary inlet provides an additional source for low distortion air for the engine during powered lift operation. When open at slow speeds, about sixty percent of the air at the engine face comes from the auxiliary inlet. The X-35B had a smaller opening with two doors hinged on the centerline of the aircraft. The F-35B has two doors hinged on the outboard sides of the opening. The change improves inlet flow performance. The increased size reflects the largest inlet within the structural constraints of the aircraft. ",♠

They're called 'stinkhorn' for a reason, because more often you smell the rotting meat smell before you see them.  More interestingly, the latin name Phallus is also [relevant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Phallus_ravenelii_59474.jpg). These mushrooms are great for splitting mycologists into two groups; the ones who laugh at dick jokes and the ones who get offended at everything.   For bonus points, stinkhorns are also known to look like [nightmare vag](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phallaceae#Genera).  Edit: My mom actually had to move the whole stinkhorn section outside at a recent mythological foray (NEMF) because the little old ladies of the group were getting offended. Also stinky. She posted about the incident on facebook, I'll copypasta because she's adorable.

t5_2qh1i,SgianDubh,1327589584,"I'm sure it's been answered already, but here it is answered correctly: A police officer must have a reason to arrest a person for DUI (Driving Under the Influence).  Suspicion to stop starts the ball rolling:  he sees you weaving, driving too slow or too fast, sitting to long a stop sign or not sitting long enough, tail light busted; whatever.  Then, in order to arrest you for DUI, he needs to establish that he reasonably suspects that you are UI, hence the Department of Transportation-designed field sobriety tests: walk and turn, horizontal gaze nystagmus, and one leg stand.  He can also use a portable breath test (PBT) machine if he suspects alcohol is involved, which he invariably does because he smells the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage, and the driver's eyes are bloodshot and glassy, and the driver's speech is slurred.  The problem is, the PBT is not admissible as evidence of the actual blood alcohol level, as it is not scientiffically reliable: they need a chemical test of blood, breath or urine.  The Intoximeter® usually has been statutorily deemed reliable and admissible for the breath test portion, but it's kept back at the station. In order to get you to the station they have to arrest you, observe you for 20 minutes, and then get the test done withing 2 hours of the driving.     Without the intoximeter, the officer can still sustain a conviction for DUI just by the FST's and testifying that he's been trained to recognize drunk people, and he recognizes that the driver was drunk.  He just can't enhance the charge to one that requires a specific blood alcohol level. ",®

Because Neurobasal medium and N-2did not maintain neuron viability for extended periods, the media was modiﬁed. These modiﬁcations included adding 0.1% chicken ovalbumin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) and increasing sodium selenite to at least 300 nM. The amount of selenite added (up to micromolar) was determined empirically for each batch of N-2. Primary neurons cultured under these conditions survived 4 –5 weeks. Serum-free Neurobasal medium with supplements has been used extensively for sustaining the survival of cultured CNS neurons (Brewer et al., 1993; Otsuki et al., 1994; Takeshima et al., 1994; Morrison et al., 1996; Xiang et al., 1996). However, supplements with very high contents of antioxidants, such as B27, were not suitable for our studies (see Results).

t5_2qh4i,JonnyQuest,1327618107,"Island in the Sea of Time-S.M. Stirling (Book 1 of trilogy)  The basic plot of S.M. Stirling's latest novel, Island In the Sea of Time, is relatively straightforward. For unknown reasons and through an unknown agency, the island of Nantucket and everything in the sea around it is transported from March 1998 to sometime around the year 1250 BC. Stirling's islanders, led by Police Chief Jared Cofflin, make do as best they can in the strange circumstances. Fortunately for the people of Nantucket, a US Coast Guard vessel, the Eagle, was also caught in the Event.  Stirling brings a large cast of characters to his tale, ranging from the visiting historian Ian Arnstein to the Coast Guard Captain Marian Alston. Each character brings their own viewpoints and abilities to the situation. While many of these characters complement each other, Stirling is aware that no community, even as small as Nantucket's, will remain a cohesive unit under any circumstances. Other characters, such as Lt. Walker and Lisketter bring their own agendas and ambitions to the situation, often with catastrophic results for the colony.  One of the strengths of the novel is the realistic portrayal of the characters. Island In the Sea of Time does not contain any Smithian or Heinleinesque superheroes who rarely make mistakes and always learn from them. All the characters tend to do things which are short-sighted and can't be corrected, and frequently make the same mistakes over when their actions remain consistent with their world view. To the same end, none of the characters has superior knowledge. By choosing Nantucket, which has a rather strange mix of population, Stirling was able to ensure a realistic convergence of skills, mechanical, artisan and even agricultural, which serve the populace well, even if it is not a self-supporting island.  Stirling has several likable characters in his cast, only occasionally resorting to caricature. Although he has ample room to give center stage to most of his characters, there are a few who could stand to take up more space. Most notable among these are Ian Arnstein and Doreen Rosenthal, both of whom will have more substantial roles in the next volume according to Stirling.  If the novel does have a weakness, it is Stirling's attention to detail. Another SF author has noted that when doing research it is important to remember what to use and what to jettison. Unfortunately, Stirling opts to use too much of his research. Scenes about the Eagle or in the machinery shop tend to bog down a little too much as Stirling tries to give the reader a flavor for the area by describing in minute detail the specific processes being followed. Stirling's editor probably could have cut between a sixth and a third of the length of the book without sacrificing substance.  Island In the Sea of Time can stand on its own. However, it is the first of a trilogy dealing with these characters and their strange situation. This gives Stirling the opportunity to explore more of his world, which may seem like a strange request given my comment about his long-windedness, but there is enough material for Stirling to write about if he can just avoid allowing too much of his research to show through.

t5_2qh1i,Newdles,1327677614,"I must not be wording this correctly. Have you ever sat a Cisco exam? They aren't a walk in the park like you are making them sound. They are set up in a way that if you pass the exam, then you are essentially demonstrating your ability to perform on the job. The exams are very 'real world' as they are not purely study/memorization. They are presented as a network with a problem. They basically say figure it out, fix it (to put it short). They don't give you any information as you have to go into the question as if you are a network consultant with no knowledge of what you are dealing with. The question is a simulation where you essentially console into each of the routers and switches and type real world commands into them to figure out what you are dealing with. If you can solve these problems, you are proving that you could perform on the job and have the knowledge to do so.  To answer your questions if I have dealt with both, yes I have. I have had situations occur in real life of near identical situations that occurred on the exam. I've used simulators, emulators, a home lab of real equipment, and more importantly worked with the stuff in live environments.   This is what the certifications are there for....to prove you can do the job. Nobody walks into a CCIE lab and says ""oh psh, this isn't the real thing so it's going to be a piece of cake."" It's a **REAL LIFE SIM** presented in exam form.  Let's look at Cisco's definition of a CCNA for example: http://www.cisco.com/web/learning/le3/le2/le0/le9/learning_certification_type_home.html  The very first line says: ""Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA®) **validates the ability** to install, configure, operate, and troubleshoot medium-size route and switched networks, including implementation and verification of connections to remote sites in a WAN.""",®

t5_2qh0u,benchicaago,1327698807," I was a volunteer at Faraja House for 4 months. I wanted to share a day at Faraja house.This is a part of my blog that i wrote when I was there.  Saturday, March 5, 2011 The Rose That Grew From Concrete   Did u hear about the rose that grew from a crack   in the concrete Proving Nature’s Laws wrong it learned 2 walk   without having feet Funny it seems but by keeping its dreams  it learned to breathe fresh air Long live the rose that grew from concrete when no one else even cared! “The Rose That Grew From Concrete” -- Tupac Shakur  The Faraja Children’s home where I work was started by Martha Moraa Bosire (Mama Moraa) while she was living in Kibera slum. Kibera is the second biggest slum in Africa, housing over 1.3 million people and is one of the more dangerous places you could place yourself on the face of the earth. Moraa was born and raised in rural Kenya. She was well educated, graduating from teaching school and got a job as a teacher in the Kenyan countryside. Her husband was killed while she was living in the country and she was forced off of her land during a time of political turmoil. She lost her job and was forced to move to Nairobi to look for work. When she arrived she lived with her family in Kibera until she was able to afford a place of her own in the slum (land costs about 35,000 Ksh or $450 per room in Kibera… not that I’m testing the market…). Moraa had two (biological) sons living with her in Kibera, who unexpectedly, brought home two friends from school whose parents had passed away. After providing shelter for those two local orphans, children began arriving at the doorstep of her 10 x 10 foot aluminum sheet house… and out of the kindness of her heart, she accepted them with open arms. In 2007 political and tribal violence broke out all over Kenya, but concentrated itself in the narrow passages of Kibera. Thousands of families were forced to flee, sometimes leaving their children behind, and many more thousands of parents were killed leaving orphans alone to fend for themselves in harsh reality of the slum. Soon the number of children under mama Moraa’s supervision swelled to 34 as the number of orphans in Kibera ballooned. She was forced to move out of the slum, partially because she couldn’t fit in the crowded “house” anymore and partially because the violence that was tearing the country apart threatened her family’s safety. She was somehow able to find accommodations for her and her children, after 4 displacements, just outside Ngong where the Faraja children’s home currently exists in the broken down and tiny house that houses all 35 members of the tightest knit family I have ever seen, heard of, or read about. If you read my first round of posts, then you already know Kepha. He is the youngest person at Faraja at around one and a half (he was left at the doorstep of the children’s home in Ngong so he has no birth certificate and has an estimated birthdate). The oldest member of the family is Dama, who is 17 years old. She takes on the responsibility of second in command behind mama Moraa. Mama Moraa (referred to as mommy by all 34 children) works 24 hours a day, just to keep the orphanage afloat, and besides a handful of volunteers (I am currently the only one that she has), she has sole responsibility for all of her children. She is the mother, housekeeper, administrator, social worker, after school tutor, cook, maid and every other position imaginable at the orphanage. My responsibilities at the orphanage entail helping mama Moraa with EVERYTHING! A typical day starts by washing the dishes (by hand, using a bar of soap and an old ripped up sock or glove as a washcloth, scrubbing the cups and plates etc. and rinsing them off in a bucket. Once they have the suds off them you use a second bucket to rinse it clean and then leave it out to dry). This process takes a long time, as you can imagine, and is followed by feeding the chickens cooking whatever food they have available and sweeping the dirt and rock front yard (…you try to figure out when a dirt floor is clean). The national food of Kenya is Ugali, a cornmeal and flour dish that is cooked over an open flame until it hardens and every Kenyan you talk to tells you that it gives you power. I now know the truth. Cooking ugali is what gives you power, not eating it. You sit over an open flame in 90+ degree heat and stir this pot that gets heavier and heavier as the ugali hardens. By the time it is cooked you are lifting and stirring what feels like 150 pounds— Kepha remains with me every day because he is too young to go to school! He has a new obsession. Sunscreen. I bring it every day because the African sun is about ten feet off the ground, and he caught me spraying myself with it one day. He put his hand out (he had never seen sunscreen before… weird, he really needs it) and I sprayed some on his hand. He flinched so hard, but I showed him how to rub it in and he started giggling uncontrollably. Now whenever I put some on he comes running over and uses the spray to shower himself and rolls on the ground laughing.  My least favorite job is going through the beans and choosing the good ones vs. the bad ones. Kefa helps me and we listen to the radio, so its bearable, but you have to go through close to 15 million beans a day (divide by a little more than pi this time) and throw the ones with bugs in them out so the kids don’t eat some nasty African bug. It’s necessary because the food they get is almost exclusively donated, so they can’t be picky, but it still needs to be safe to eat.  Then the kids come home and the fun begins! I get to play with them. Playing with the kids is amazing! They are so entertained by anything and they are always having a good time playing with each other. Besides the day to day activities and fun, the orphanage is a mess. The house and children are living in dire circumstances and it is impossible to overstate their need for help. Despite the best efforts of Moraa, and the tireless work of her children in the upkeep of the house, the orphanage, meant to provide shelter for the abandoned, love for children who have lived through hate and in some circumstances, life in the face of death, is desperate. Moraa never intended to create this safe haven for some of the world’s most in-need children, and therefore never had a business plan or a means to make money. It is so in need that it has flown under the radar of all charities and has no funds. Now, seven years after she took in her first two orphans, facing eviction from the small, run down house with no shelter to turn to, with no funds for food; everyday a constant struggle to nourish her 34 children, let alone herself, I find myself in Ngong, attempting to do all I can not only to help the orphanage, but to give Moraa a much deserved break. She needs a minute to breathe, to kick her feet up and maybe, probably not, but maybe… sleep. The orphanage is in rough shape because they have no money to bring people in, and one woman who needs to take care of everything. She cannot tend to administration and upkeep when she has to cook for 35 people, take one kid to the doctor (over 30 minutes away), wash the dishes, worry about all of her kids getting to school. All of this is difficult enough and add the fact that she can’t afford the matatu ride into town (50 cents) so she has to walk back and forth which burns 45 minutes in transit alone. She doesn’t even have time to apply for help from outside sources, so the situation continues to get worse. The need is real and the stakes are incredibly high. These children have come from less than nothing, no love, no food, no refuge and have created something incredibly beautiful. The Faraja Children’s Home is a rose that grew from concrete. The orphanage is an impossible accomplishment, overcoming obstacles to become a true marvel, and a testament to what is possible from the power of kindness, determination and love. No one in the world cared about these children after they lost their parents, slipping through the cracks of humanity, but the orphanage has blossomed (not without struggle, BELIEVE ME) into something beautiful. This is only my third week at the orphanage and I have learned more from this place about dedication and hardship, how unfair this world truly is and how so much positivity can fight its way to the surface even amidst the lack of basic necessities. I have watched a grown woman cry because her 34 children have gone hungry for days with no means to get food in the near future. I have been on hand and knee scrubbing dishes in water that would make me dry-heave before this experience. But in the same day or even sometimes the same hour or minute, I have also seen a one and a half year laugh the most pure and joyful laugh you can imagine. I have watched silently as a group of children… CHILDREN, who haven’t seen food in God knows how long, serve their adopted brothers and sisters before they take their first helping. It is a powerful place, I assure you that-- and this rose growing from concrete, inhaling the polluted Nairobi air did not come about without the same struggle that keeps it alive. It is difficult to find words with enough strength to carry the weight of the burden that this place endures. I promised I wouldn’t get too depressing on you but I hope that you see the good and the bad. Because that is what Kenya is, the happiest place in the world with some of the saddest circumstances.  permalink         about blog advertise source code contact us  help help FAQ reddiquette subreddits  tools mobile firefox extension chrome extension buttons widget  &lt;3 reddit gold store redditgifts reddit.tv radio reddit  Use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy. © 2012 reddit inc.

t5_2s6rw,afreshmind,1327730531,"just gonna comment with my revisions for the mods, the file I emailed you will work better for making corrections though!  Hey, oh! Nice job!  I tried to make corrections in red and suggestions in parenthesis. But then I got lazy and stopped doing that.  So if a change is grammatically necessitated, go ahead and make that change no matter what.  But if it’s something else I put that sounds better in your head than mine, leave it be ☺ Experiences are what make us who we are. The experiences we have teach us (/shape) our values and customs. I believe that my experiences have prepared me for the affairs that will come my way. One such affair that I would (very much) like to be a part of the University of North Florida ([UNF]) Honors Program. I believe that I will benefit from the program through the exclusive classes available to Honors Students and (also from) the new duties/(opportunities) that will be available to me. I believe that I will make a quality addition to the UNF Honors Program for the following reasons. I changed some stuff in the last sentence because I’m wondering if it’s easier to say the UNF program instead of UNF’s program. But, either way, eh. They both work! One of the most fulfilling experiences I’ve had so far was when I volunteered as Technical Director for my high school’s drama program. The Technical Director’s duties include keeping schedules, managing people, and fulfilling the director and producer’s visions for the production. As Technical Director, I oversaw every behind the scenes aspect of production. I motivated and assigned people to projects.   -sidenote- if you’re gonna use a choppy sentence “I motivated and assigned, etc” it fits in better context with other choppy sentences and there’s nothing wrong with this:  I motivated people. I did this.  I did this.  Leadership blah blah.  Yknow? That can be effective.  As it is now, it just seems forced/out of place so work on making it fit better either by surrounding it immediately on one or both sides with more descriptions of your duties or weaving it in more effectively otherwise.  Being able to manage effectively to fit our tight schedule took leadership. I also gained practice in teamwork by helping crews accomplish a variety of tasks including building a platform, painting a set piece, or even ironing costumes. As Technical Director, a lot of issues fell on my shoulders. I needed to be quick on my feet and have a sharp mind to fix emerging problems. The instances I managed crises tested both my critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Once during production, we had used the last of our budget on building the set but still needed at least $150 worth of lumber. After some searching, I was able to find a local lumber dealer and make an arrangement with him where he would trade us some lumber for ad space in our play program. There was also an issue where our costume mistress was threatening to quit the production and take all of the male costumes home with her. To leverage the fallout, I presented on our need for donations at the parent booster meeting.  Even though our costume mistress ultimately chose to stay, we received enough donations to add an additional costume change between scenes. A successful person starts any job, assignment, project, or resolution with determination, devotion, and a sense of enthusiasm. These traits are clearly reflected in my academic experiences at UNF. When was touring the campus with my father in August of 2010, I heard about a deadline some 2 weeks later to have my application reviewed .  This opportunity would allow me to find out if I would be accepted for enrollment the following October. I gathered what I needed and ordered my transcripts by the application deadline. On October 2nd, I received my admission decision.  I had been invited to start classes the upcoming summer, but if I brought up my high school GPA, I could change my start date to the fall instead. I finished the first semester of my senior year with six As and one B. This improvement allowed me to change my start date to the fall, and I continued to perform extremely well in my classes during my second semester. This determination still hasn’t faltered now that I find myself taking college level courses (courses sounds better than classes sometimes) use a ; or a : here instead of a period. I completed my first semester with a 3.7 GPA. My enthusiasm hasn’t faded either. It’s the beginning of my second semester and I walk into every class (this is a case when “class” sounds nicer though, so nice job) eager to learn what each professor has to offer. I am already looking forward to the classes that I will take next fall, and the spring after that. Thanks to this zeal, I am able to complete homework easily and receive near-perfect grades. I recently declared a major in Health Administration. Before declaring, I thought I wanted a degree in business; I knew that I wanted to work in healthcare, but didn’t see how I could do this without taking up nursing. In September of 2009, my mother was diagnosed with invasive breast cancer.  Since then, I have lost count of the number of times I’ve witnessed her experiences with the health care system. I realized that there were actual people behind all of the hospital and insurance companies that helped my mom get her health back, and I decided that this was the job I wanted. My dream job is to become a Hospital Administrator. I want to be able to manage doctors and procedures as effectively as possible to provide a comfortable experience for patients on the road to recovery. To reach my goals, I look forward to completing internships that will let me/(allow me) apply skills to a job I want to make into my/a career (good sentence). I also have applied to live in the Brooks College of Health Living Learning Community for next school year. Through the Living Learning Community (if you capitalize it before, and you do, you need to keep it consistent for the rest of the piece.  Keep capitalizing the LLC or don’t capitalize it the first time., I hope to meet professionals in my field who will give me insight and advice for my advancement. I will also be pursuing a Leadership Certificate from the UNF Institute of Values. I have not taken Introduction to Leadership yet, but plan to do so this coming fall to begin my official documentation of my leadership experiences. In addition to discovering new talents, the University of North Florida’s Honors Program will help me polish and develop the skills I already have (started to develop). I am an earnest applicant who wants to grow and further mature, develop, etc. if you use develop earlier in the sentence though, switch it out for a synonym here in the name of word variance within my university. The experiences and goals I’ve written about show why I would make a good asset for the program. Try and put some transitional sentence here to connect the really straight sentence and this less explicit, more grand quote.  Maybe a sentence like “And I am determined to succeed” or something like that.  Lydia Maria Child, a woman’s rights activist from the 1800’s, once said, “Belief in oneself is one of the most important bricks in building any successful venture.” I believe in myself.  I know that I will prosper at University of North Florida, and will prosper (further, as well, even greater) in University of North Florida’s Honors Program. ",☺

Goto http://www.irs.gov/freefile.  [TurboTax® Freedom Edition](apps.irs.gov/app/freeFile/jsp/index.jsp?ck) is a good choice for electronic filing.

It provides some kind of support obviously, but is this meant to lower the strain on your arms or is this for stability purposes? (shaky hands or something like that)  EDIT: Nevermind, I checked their [site](http://www.equipoisinc.com/products/xAr/) , and it answered my questions  For the lazy:  &gt;X-Ar is an exoskeletal arm that attaches to your arm and provides dynamic support throughout your natural range of motion.  Derived from the same award-winning technology as our zeroG® line of products, X-Ar can bear the weight of your arm and small objects that you are holding while preserving your freedom of movement – which means you can work with your arms outstretched for long periods with less fatigue and discomfort.  &gt; &gt; &gt;X-Ar can enhance your stamina and precision, which (like our zeroG products) can significantly boost productivity and reduce injuries.  It won’t give you superhuman strength or do your work for you.  The first version of X-Ar is not a medical device that can be used to address medical conditions (later versions are planned to assist disabled persons and other medical applications). &gt; &gt; &gt;X-Ar is designed to assist with a wide range of activities where people work with their arms outstretched, from assembly operations in factories to laboratory tasks to office work.  &gt;Applications include: &gt; &gt; &gt;Welding &gt;MIG &amp; TIG &gt; &gt; &gt;Electronics Assembly &gt;Precision Assembly &gt;Soldering &amp; Brazing &gt; &gt; &gt;Painting &gt;Powder Coating &gt;Electrostatic Painting &gt;Sanding &gt; &gt; &gt;Light Manufacturing and Assembly &gt;Deburring &amp; Sanding &gt;Small Component Assembly",®

And if you were there the entire 24 hours please let me know, as I'm sure at least a few of you were!    Climbing Mount Everest of Streaming:  Objective Complete!  And the interesting factoid learned from this is that mass gaming for many, many hours is very bad for learning new builds/strategies and is detrimental to getting better at Starcraft 2.  That may have been somewhat obvious regardless of going through the 24 hours, but I can confirm it after doing this.  I didn't feel like I was absorbing new information that much like 13 hours into the stream marathon.  What I will say though is the mass grinding of many games does in fact help your muscle memory for maintaining and improving your keyboard/mouse mechanics.  Just like any sport, just grinding and putting in the time helps this out immensely, but you already have to have solid fundamental mechanics for this type of mass gaming grinding to be beneficial!

Guy A was an old friend from high school, and we kinda had this on and off relationship. I had met guy B in college through a friend, and we got along really well.  Well ill fast forward to a few years later, while I was doing my masters Guy B started med school, guy A wasn’t really going to school, but he did the odd job here and there. Well the story goes Guy B, when he had free time he wanted to spend his time with me, and I wasn’t too sure why such a nice and smart guy would want to date me, I felt really insecure and I honestly didn’t know what to do since I was still seeing guy A. In the end tho, I ended up leaving guy A (I couldn’t put up with his BS anymore) and started dating Guy B.

t5_2s6rw,afreshmind,1327977193,"sent in a better format!  just posting it here for the mods!   As always, I’ll try to put my corrections in just red and my suggestions in parenthesis.  For those, if you think it sounds better your way, keep it.  It’s your work ☺  I liked the essay, best of luck!  Growing up, I remember my father telling me “be an independent, genuine lady. Work hard to achieve a good education to draw your path to success.” Growing up in China, neither of my parents had the opportunity to get an education. They immigrated to the United States with an ambition to build a family that could live a finer lifestyle. My parents continuously stressed over financial issues as their tough physical (do you mean physically-labor based?) jobs provided low income. They taught me the importance of obtaining an education and discovering a profession that I would enjoy. My interest for science began when my father was diagnosed with liver cancer due to a chronic hepatitis B infection. Before he was diagnosed, I honestly had almost no idea of what cancer was, or even what the hepatitis B virus was. I was ashamed because I was not knowledgeable about these issues and how exactly treatments, like chemotherapy and radiation, could prevent cancer cells from multiplying and disseminating. I remember trying to do some research at a young age, (you don’t even have to say “when I was in middle school” but can if you think it works) ;attempting to read articles on these topics almost seemed as if I was trying to decipher an unfamiliar language. I knew that if I wanted to become familiar with these concepts, I would need to seek this fulfillment through/by pursuing/in higher education.  	My first year of college, I did not exactly know what I desired to major in. After much deliberation, I decided to get my bachelor’s in Physiology because I (found myself/)was fascinated with learning how a variety of biological systems function in organisms. After acquiring my bachelor’s degree, I plan on applying to pharmacy school to attain a PharmD (PharmD?) degree, (in order to become a pharmacist)…you really might not even need this end to the sentence because you are going to pharmacy school to attain a PharmD to become a pharmacist.  a bit circular/repetitive, wouldn’t you say?. Because I both have strong communication skills related to working with others and find learning about the composition of drugs and how they affect individuals engaging, I believe becoming a pharmacist is a fitting prospective career (good sentence, but kind of long/hard to follow , you can chop it up if you’d like). I knew this decision would require a long path of devotion to my studies with diligence. I was/(am?) willing to make this commitment, even if it meant/(means) sacrificing a majority of my social time in order to do well. I started volunteering at University Medical Center in outpatient pharmacy IN spring of 2011 because I wanted to get an idea for the basics of working in a pharmacy. Although some people might find it a priority (a  “priority” like…work they don’t look forward to ?  if this is what you mean, I get it kind of.)to volunteer at the pharmacy, I find it more of a learning experience each time wait what?  not sure what these last 2 sentences mean/what you are moving towards. It actually amazes me how much I look forward to going into the pharmacy every week to interact with the pharmacists and technicians knowing that I’ll grasp something new. 	Earlier this year at a pre-pharmacy meeting, Doctor (it just sounds better here as doctor than dr in my opinion ☺) Boesen guest spoke regarding toxicology research and his role at the poison control center. He elucidated the development of antivenom(or antivenin if you want to sound more formal) and its experimentation on individuals to monitor the effects. I never imagined I would be captivated by his lecture regarding the field of toxicology. I began to wonder, “What if doing research is a profession I would be more fond of than becoming a pharmacist?” I immediately came to the conclusion that I needed to get involved in research to broaden my range of possible careers. good.The area of research in particular that  I find most interesting is testing drugs on biological systems and analyzing their organic interactions, both the beneficial and harmful ones. I do not want to look back ten years from now feeling remorseful and contemplating whether I would have had a more satisfying career route if I were exposed to research.  	There are many skills and opportunities I intend to gain through participation in USRB (or whatever the acronym was, sorry I can’t remember). For one, I want to meet new people who have similar passions. I hope to connect with my research group as they reveal their own personal experiences with me good sentence. I feel that hearing other peoples’ personal experiences motivates me further towards (completing) my education. I expect to successfully work together to master valuable skills that will be beneficial to me in the future and take in any criticism and advice from my new associates that will help me evolve as an individual. I cannot say that I may know a lot about/regarding the particular research area at this point, but I can guarantee I will catch on quickly and am willing to acquire the skills to eventually specialize in this area. I am a dependable and responsible person who will not let temporary failures hold me back; (in fact,) they often give me more determination to improve. I will use my problem-solving abilities and apply the knowledge I have to come up with solutions to the conflicts I encounter. If given this opportunity, I can promise I will not dissatisfy my team and will give my full dedication/pour myself fully into into accomplishing our goals and advancing our research. 	awesome work, you sound like a great candidate!

t5_2qh13,UncleVanya,1327979259,"''VANCOUVER -- In a rare move, Vancouver police are fighting back publicly against a lawsuit filed by a man who was repeatedly bitten in the leg by a police dog after he smashed the glass door of a city bus with his skateboard.  On Monday morning, Vancouver police released video footage of 33-year-old Christopher Evans, attempting to force his way onto the bus.  Police also released a 911 call made by a Coast Mountain Bus Company employee during the incident.  The video shows passengers filing onto the bus, which police said was loading near the 1400-block of East Hastings Street by Clark Drive around 12:45 a.m. on June 12, 2011.  Just before the bus pulls away, Evans appears outside in front. He swings his skateboard, hitting the closed front passenger door, cracking the glass.  ""What do you want from me?"" The female bus drivers asks, clearly alarmed.  ""Open the f---ing door,"" Evans yells back, hitting the glass several more times.  ""I'm not opening the door, you're too aggressive,"" she responds.  ""Call the police,"" an out-of-frame passenger yells, as Evans continues swinging.  The driver can be heard describing the situation over her radio to Coast Mountain dispatch, which relayed the message to 911.  Deputy chief Const. Adam Palmer told reporters the release of evidence ahead of the pending civil case is unusual, but not unprecedented.  ""There's two sides to the story,"" he said, explaining that police wanted to provide the ""full context"" of what happened that night.  Backed by Pivot Legal Society, Evans filed civil court documents on Dec. 12, 2011. He named as defendants the officer at the scene, Const. Richard Ronald Lee, and Const. Howard Rutter, the department's dog training constable, along with the City of Vancouver.  Evans required nearly 100 staples to close several wounds on his right leg after the dog attack which — according to him — came without warning.  Evans said he was wearing headphones and didn't hear the officer or the dog approaching as he skated away.  The arrest took place in a dark lane on East Hastings, Palmer said, explaining the officer pursued Evans in a cruiser with its siren and emergency lights activated before releasing the dog. ""The flashing lights would be very visible in the lane,"" he said, adding that should have alerted Evans to the police presence.  ""The officer had [Evans] into custody in less than a minute,"" Palmer said, adding the dog bit Evans four times.  Evans was arrested for mischief, handcuffed, and taken immediately to hospital.  Crown counsel dropped the charges against him after seeing photos of his leg, said his lawyer, Douglas King.  Palmer said he didn't know why the charges were dropped.  Pivot has requested a review of Vancouver police dog-handling protocol, suggesting that service dogs should only be deployed when chasing ""serious,"" armed, or potentially dangerous offenders. It also requested a review of the police department's ""bite and hold"" protocol — a method that trains dogs to immediately bite and apprehend suspects once deployed.  Vancouver police have said repeatedly over the last several days the department has no plans to change its methods.  eduggan@vancouversun.com © Copyright (c) The Vancouver Sun  Read more: http://www.vancouversun.com/sports/Vancouver+police+fight+back+over+police+bite+lawsuit+video/6073860/story.html#ixzz1l0A16dPE '' ",©

t5_2r94o,EnkiduEnkita,1328008399,"**~~Psychotherapist~~ Psychiatrist here**,  I completely agree with you. In a way, it's a symbolic gesture.  I'm a vegetarian and I consume gelcaps because I can't really get my prescription any other way. My Hindu neighbours give their kids gummy vitamins, even though they contain our beloved sacred bovine. Sometimes, it's just easier to make exceptions.  However--some folks throw out gelcaps because *being a vegetarian constitutes part of their identity*, and to consume gelatin therefore defeats a part of their identity. This is more common with stricter (we got some pretty crazy folks in the store, one wouldn't let me use the barcode-scanner-thing because she was certain it would irradiate her food) vegetarians/vegans, as you might imagine. You might compare it to a holocaust survivor who is opposed to making nazi jokes: nobody's being hurt (and hell, it might cheer someone up), but it will still be personally debasing to do so. That's a bit of an extreme example, but I think that helps clarify its relationship to my point.  What do you think?  I respect the choice, I don't see anything wrong with sticking by one's moral identity and that can be a healthy way of stabilizing one's psyche. Dogmatism sucks, yeah, but to a degree, it's good to stick by what you believe in -- even if it's symbolic, as I stated initially.  Sincerely,  **Has a Personal Library**  EDIT 0: I prescribe you four billion gelcaps an hour. Alternative is shock therapy on your prick, which we will then cut off and force-feed to your future fiancé(e). ☑ *This is a minor edit*  EDIT 1: tl;dr: yeah but it's cool.",☑
