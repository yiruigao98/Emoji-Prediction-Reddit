There's no obligation even to share your thoughts on it with others if you don't want to. Relax and enjoy.  I do think you bring up an interesting thought though. As individuals we can chose how to interrupt and enjoy religious holidays if we decide to do so and it is interesting to read what personal meaning that this holiday has for everyone.   Personally, since I do appreciate the moral teachings of Jesus, I will reflect on those as I spend time with family. I will try to avoid getting too caught up in gifts and shopping, as I recall my dad stating times before as we watched store parking lots fill with last minute shoppers that sadly Christmas has become a financial burden for many families. We never really did go over the top with the whole presents thing, though I will say that I am lucky to have received many thoughtful gifts.   ‚ô• ",‚ô•

t5_2qzru,terari,1338524560,"‚ô•  My mom is a bit like you.. in the sense that she has a wild humor and sometimes she has a kind of delirium when she speaks very fast - with herself.. - and changes subjects in a blazing speed. Also she has grandeur plans and see herself as one of the brightest minds of the world (she was also diagnosed with schizophrenia on her teens, but I'm not sure how accurate was that diagnosis, because the doctors were too hasty and apparently quite abusive. also, I don't want to label her, I'm not a doctor)  But she is oblivious about all of that. She doesn't recognize she has an issue and was never on meds (except a brief period when she was interned as a teen). In fact for some time I thought everyone like this didn't recognized their problems as such.  You seem to have a high degree of awareness on how your mind operates. Is this typical for someone bipolar? What's the ""secret"" on being self-aware of those issues?  And how did you became aware of it? Was there a time when you just didn't believe you had problems?  Also. Hmmm. To be honest, I am a bit like my mom (and you) in that I have some mania and I have some focus on grandiose plans. But I try to have a foot on reality, in the sense that my mom has delusions and believe in strange things while mine are more like fictional things that happen in my head (and I know they are fictional).

t5_2qzru,natalietoday,1338525581,"Thanks so much for all your kind words! For a while I wasn't so aware of all the inner workings. In fact, it was actually when I learned about my mother's own diagnosis of bipolar disorder (years and years ago, still untreated, I doubt she even remembers or realizes there's a problem) that the lightbulb went off and I asked my father to take me somewhere I could talk to someone.  Before that point, I don't believe I saw much of a problem -- nor did anybody else, I don't think. I was thought of as ""gifted"" when I was younger; I grasped subjects in school rather easily and got bored VERY quickly with the regular material. As I got a little older, that boredom appeared to turn into laziness and inattentiveness (precursor signs of ADHD), which I notice gets amplified when I'm in a manic state.  When various stressful events happened in my family, (looking back on it now) they seemed to trigger my more intense mood swings. That's when I saw the connection to my mother's mood swings, and asked for help.  As for being aware of how my mind operates... to be honest, I feel like that's really just a pleasant side-effect of slowly coming down from the peak of a manic phase. :) Normally I'm nearly oblivious to how my mind really works, and I'm intensely jealous of my boyfriend who has a very keen sense of his inner self. ‚ô•",‚ô•

t5_2qh0r,KittyttiK,1338537945,"Once again a thread on Ron Paul where Ron Paul supporters are getting -30. Gee. Every single time this happens is because EPS linked to it. Is that true this time? * *checks* * Yes. I mean, I have no problem at all with individuals downvoting, it's the organized nature of these attacks which is very similar to the famous bot that was the subject of much discussion and wrong in the same way.   Where's the little online news story and the front page post of /r/politics about how we are being silenced? Right. There won't be one.   The only reason I'm pointing this out is so maybe some of the people over at EPS might start to understand that some of us don't have as many places we can discuss things without being completely disregarded.   I know many people don't care about the Ron Paul campaign that's why I **purposely** come to the RP subreddit. If you want to complain about Ron Paul spam being elsewhere - okay. fine. but if you come to the Ron Paul subreddit you are CHOOSING to subject yourself to it.  If one is to demand civility constantly of Ron Paul supporters, they should practice the same. I don't expect you to be responsible for others actions, just your own. If you are not just here to mock people, this does not apply to you. **Nobody** is perfect and If you don't want to be civil that's your call, but understand that you may not be taken seriously.  I don't want people in this subreddit to be discouraged from posting legitimate topics or posting replies here if they are sincere about wanting to participate, but there's times I view this subreddit by comments and literally half of the comments will be name-calling, mocking or trolling or otherwise not adding to the discussion.  You may mock me by replying that I'm being ""braveheart"" or some other snarky reply like I've received in the past and that's okay. I'm totally guilty of putting my serious business face on too often when it comes to politics.   I just kindly ask that if you write out a comment read it and consider where or not you are just spamming this subreddit with mocking and insults and if so - maybe don't. Thanks. ‚ô•     ",‚ô•

The report [TankeNyckeln](http://www.scribd.com/doc/94021562/TankeNyckeln) (like Mind Key or Mind Lever) (I don't usually use Scribd, this was an exception) It's a bitmapped scanned version which a friend kindly provided recently as I had lost my own original in my last move 2007. I also made a brief summary (in English, my orig in Swedish) about it [here](http://nonutopia.org/personal/tankenyckeln/tankenyckeln.html) from 2004.  Some of my collegaues at that time laughed and considered it pure science fiction, but most of my friends who know me well, respected it.

t5_2qh6c,aim2free,1338563041,"Thanks ‚ù£  I really hope this accuracy will last, I can make a brief summary of page 61/67:  _We are ""writing"" anno 2037. It has passed one century since Konrad Zuse constructed the first electromechanical digital calculator whose fundamentally simple principle made the computer, the most wonderful invention by mankind, possible. Probably the society would have existed still even without computers, but no-one is longer sure about this._ _During the previous century the humanity was suffering from a lot of problems that today only exists in the historic data bases._ _Here are mentioned such irregularities as starvation, drug abuse, apartheid, environmental pollution and destruction, bureaucracy, educational problems, unemployment and the ubiquitous threat that a leader from one of that era's ""countries"" would choose to solve a conflict with non peaceful means. Word like ""VIOLENCE"" and ""WAR"" were common at this time._  _Today most elderly people have usually repressed that these problems have ever existed. There are many people of the young generation that during their primary education refuse to believe that we have ever behaved like that. However, it often happens that some of the younger persuade someone with associations left from this time to narrate about that era's horror and foolishness._  _The technical and psychosocial development has only during the last 50 years changed the society by enhancing the good properties of mankind to such great an extent that as late as 1970-1990 it was hardly possible for anyone to imagine what will come. During this epoch there were even people that had lost their beliefs in both humanity and mankind._  The 9th generation of programming languages on page 65 can also be somewhat interesting.   *9th:* _The delicate improvements in the communication between man and TOS (Terrestrial Operating System) has implied that you can now work at an abstraction level which approaches the border of human fantasy. A problem or a solution that earlier has been almost impossible to reason about abstractly, can now be formulated thrugh small hints by ""thinking"" as close to the problem as you can. The final formalization of the problem is obtained by automatic or ""manual"" correlation between all possible and many impossible formalizations until sufficient significance has been reached._   It was actually this last part which later inspired me to start my PhD program, and after many years as a researcher and research consultant I realized how to implement this (2004), and the implementation of this is what I'm working on now.

Dirac Live¬Æ is unique in offering true mixed-phase impulse response correction. This is achieved not just in a small listening region, but in a volume of arbitrary size.

Loudspeakers measured in rooms are mixed-phase and consequently only a mixed-phase correction can restore the intended impulse response. Minimum-phase filters only consider the magnitude response and fail to address time-domain problems. Some room correction systems employ FIR filters, others IIR.

t5_2qh2p,terari,1338605429,"Oh. Hmm. I am myself okay if the mods remove this post. I feel great with it (either on /r/atheism, on /r/LGBT, or any other subreddit where it is accepted by its community), but I respect their policy decisions.  I am also okay with it being posted or reposted on subreddits that would downvote it to oblivion - it is the way communities signal that it is not well received there.  And I am not allowing anything, it's the community of /r/atheism that is allowing its presence. I understand how you see it as inadequate. If /r/atheism weren't a default subreddit, probably this kind of situation would be less common.  I see this problem - where /r/atheism subscribers vote ""wrongly"" at submissions - analogous to the ""dumb voter"" problem on elections, where *intelligent voters* would vote the *good candidate* while the *bad candidate* will manipulate the dumb voters to vote for him (or, the dumb voters would vote for a joke candidate, would waste their vote, etc)  This suggests that the a dumb voter's vote is somehow worse or inferior than a intelligent voter's vote. From this, one might conclude that one should inform the dumb voters better, or failing that, prevent them to vote. This might lead to an aggressively anti-democratic view on elections: namely, that everyone is free to vote, except people who vote like a dumb voter.  Our present situation is a model for that if we equate ""people who did bother to go into the comments"" as ""intelligent voters"" and other people as ""dumb voters"".  We have a mechanism to work around the dumb voters problem: diligent moderation. And we both agreed with its adequacy to tackle the problem, as long as the mods are up to it. So we are in agreement in almost everything, except that you consider the topic of /r/atheism being.. atheism (which is justified!) and that I consider its topic as being more fluid, determined by the present wishes of the community.

t5_2scaw,Aspel,1338607885,"It is interesting to note that over on the other discussion, most of the people who've actually played the game are pointing out that this article is completely overreactive.   Atlus is an incredibly progressive company, and pretty much everything the person writing this article says is incredibly infuriating, not just from the angle of someone saying bad things about a series I like--haven't played half those games, though of note, in *Persona 3 Portable* you can play as a female character, which I jumped at--but because it comes off as another American judging the morals and attitudes of a foreign country without first understanding them. We're talking about a country here that thinks women should be lesbians until they're 16, and who's relationship to LGBT issues is coloured by ancient culture and modern Western ideals clashing.  Naota Shirogane, for instance, is a character type known as *bokku-ko*. Literally, a girl who uses the masculine first person pronoun *boku* to refer to herself. That does *not* mean that she's transgender, although gender *issues* are strongly at play in her story. In a way, from what I've garnered about Naota, she's much like my opposite. She has no problems being female, but she prefers to be mistaken for male. After all, she's doing a man's work. People think she's a man. They'll look down on her less if they see her as him.  Likewise, *Catherine* is another game that has had nothing but praise from the transgender community, leading me to think that the author is talking out of her proverbial ass. In fact, a close friend, trans herself, has loved *Catherine* specifically for the trans character, and if I wasn't poor as dirt and generally not in the mood for a great story broken up by a puzzle platformer--seriously, that is like the biggest gameplay story segregation ever--I'd play it for the trans character myself. As has been pointed out elsewhere, not only is her treatment handled well, the main character already knows from the start, and she gets a happy ending.   Moving on, I love how an example of transphobia is a heterosexual male character seeing a transman in a skirt and saying ""she looks cute"". This article even opens on a shaky at best premise. The only thing here that could even remotely be considered transphobia is the bit with Junpei at the beach scoping for babes, but not wanting to have sex with a transgender woman does not transphobia make. Although I do wonder how that scene plays out with a female main character in *P3P*, since there's only one babe for me, and that's ~‚ô•Junpei‚ô•~.  So, the tl;dr: overreactionary, jumping to conclusions, complete lack of understanding of Japanese culture, and poor writing.  **PS**: And if you're going to downvote me, could you at least *please* attempt to have a discussion, since I've done nothing but raise valid points. You have no idea how irritating it is to be robbed of conversation simply because people don't *like* you.",‚ô•

First and foremost, we want to make it clear that the Battle.net and Diablo III servers have not been compromised. In addition, the number of Diablo III players who've contacted customer service to report a potential compromise of their personal account has been extremely small. In all of the individual Diablo III-related compromise cases we've investigated, none have occurred after a physical Battle.net Authenticator or Battle.net Mobile Authenticator app was attached to the player's account, and we have yet to find any situation where a Diablo III player's account was accessed outside of ""traditional"" compromise methods (i.e. someone logging using an account's login email and password).  &gt;To that end, we've also seen discussions regarding the possibility of account compromises occurring in ways that didn‚Äôt involve these ""traditional"" methods -- for example, by ""session spoofing"" a player‚Äôs identity after he or she joins a public game. Regarding this specific example, we've looked into the issue and found no evidence to indicate compromises are occurring in this fashion, and we've determined the methods being suggested to do so are technically impossible. However, you have our assurance that we‚Äôll continue to investigate reports such as these and keep you informed of important updates.  As you can see they're making some fairly bold statements. To their knowledge no accounts have been hacked in a way that doesn't involve the username and password being acquired. No accounts with the mobile or dongle authenticators have been compromised. And finally that there is no evidence of session spoofing and that it is technically impossible for someone to hijack another person's account in this manner.  It's the third statement that is the most telling one. The first two could possibly be retracted later (""upon further investigation"", ""new information has come to light"", etc etc) as they are statements in good faith (""as far as we know"", ""to the best of our knowledge""). But that third statement, if later shown to be false, can probably only be attributed to premeditated deception or gross incompetence, either of which could be used as grounds for legal action if hacks that resulted in the financial information of Blizzard's customers being stolen were to occur.  Sure none of this is set in stone and I may be completely wrong. However, my experience has been that you don't get statements like that from PR professionals unless they can be backed up.",¬Æ

My concern and confusion came in during playing with the BIOS settings on this particular MB. I saw the settings for IDE, AHCI, and RAID. If I change the settings to RAID it automatically does it for Ports 1-4. While ports 5-6 give me the option of either IDE or Raid, but won't go into IDE mode because ports 1-4 have to be in IDE mode for it to work.   So with the case I have it has an external eSATA port that I ran the ""case cable"" and plugged it into the vertical (standalone) SATA port.

t5_2qm4e,ech0nd4rkn3ss,1338658604,"#2 Neurogenesis  What Is It?  You know all that controversy out there about stem cell research? Well, the whole thing with stem cells is that they can basically be used to re-generate dead cells. Particularly of interest to zombologists like ourselves is neurogenesis ·¥•, the method by which they can re-grow dead brain tissue.  You can see where this is going...  How This Can Result In Zombies?  Science can pretty much save you from anything but brain death; they can swap out organs but when the brain turns to mush, you're gone. Right?  Well, not for long. They're already able to re-grow the brains of comatose head trauma patients ·¥•·¥•·¥• until they wake up and walk around again.   Couple that with the new ability to keep a dead body in a state of suspended animation‚Ä¢ so that it can be brought back to life later, and soon we'll be able to bring back the dead, as long as we get to them quickly enough.  That sounds great, right? Well, this lab‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ dedicated to ""reanimation research"" (yes, that's what they call it) explains how the process of ""reanimating"" a person creates a problem. It causes the brain to die off from the outside in. The outside being the cortex, the nice part of you that makes humans human. That just leaves the part that controls basic motor function and primitive instincts behind.   You don't need the cortex to survive; all you need is the stem and you'll still be able to mindlessly walk and eat and enjoy Grey's Anatomy. This is how chickens can keep walking around after they've been beheaded (including one case where the chicken lived for 18 months without a head‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢).  So, you take a brain dead patient, use these techniques to re-grow the brain stem, and you now have a mindless body shambling around, no thoughts and no personality, nothing but a cloud of base instincts and impulses.   That, ladies and gentlemen, is what we like to call a real, live, undead fucking zombie. So there.   Chances This Could Cause The Zombie Outbreak?  Think about it. Under every legal system in the world, all rights and responsibilities are terminated at death. All it takes is someone with resources and a need for a mindless workforce of totally obedient slave labor.  How long until somebody tries this? We're betting somebody in the world, maybe North Korea, will have a working zombie by Christmas.   And my favorite #1 Nanobots  What Are They?  Nanobots are a technology that science apparently engineered to make you terrified of the future. We're talking about microscopic, self-replicating robots that can invisbily build--or destroy--anything. Vast sums of money are being poured into nanotechnology. Sure, at some level scientists know nanobots will destroy mankind. They just can't resist seeing how it happens.   How Can It Result In Zombies?  Scientists have already created a nano-cyborg‚ñ™, by fusing a tiny silicone chip to a virus. The first thing they found out is these cyborgs can still operate for up to a month after the death of the host. Notice how nano scientists went right for zombification, even at this early stage. They know where the horror is.  According to studies‚ñ™‚ñ™, within a decade they'll have nanobots that can crawl inside your brain and set up neural connections to replace damaged ones. That's right; the nanobots will be able to rewire your thoughts. What could possibly go wrong?   Chances This Could Cause The Zombie Outbreak? Do the math, people.  Some day there will be nanobots in your brain. Those nanobots will be programmed to keep functioning after you die. They can form their own neural pathways, meaning they can use your brain to keep operating your limbs after you've deceased and, presumably, right up until you rot to pieces in mid-stride.   The nanobots will be programmed to self-replicate, and the death of the host will mean the end of the nanobots. To preserve themselves, they'd need to transfer to a new host. Therefore, the last act of the nanobot zombie would be to bite a hole in a healthy victim, letting the nanobots steam in and set up camp in the new host. Once in, they can shut down the part of the brain that resists (the cortex) and leave the brain stem intact. They will have added a new member to the unholy army of the undead.",‚ñ™

t5_2qh2p,terari,1338661805,"Uhmm. I use the term ""community"" in a loose sense: the set of people who reads, votes and comments on posts here. Not everyone is as participative: some people will interact only lightly, but since they can cast votes as much as hardcore members, they count as full members of the community for the purpose of sorting the posts here. In fact many people will cast their votes without bothering to look the subreddit the post came from; we don't ask people to have a coherent rationale for their vote, so it's okay that people vote the way they prefer.  I agree this post is wholly neutral on the topic of spirituality, but this subreddit has a broader topic than atheism, to include topics *related to* secular living as well. This post might be very weakly related to secular living, but the community *of voters* decided it should be promoted.  Against that, there is only one one alternative: moderation action.  By the way, I am repeating the same and same arguments on this thread. Can we agree with those two points:  1. The moderators can remove topics that they consider on-topic - and this is the only recourse against posts being upvoted too much.  2. In absence of active moderators, The voters will determine the ranking of posts, creating their notion of what is ""on topic"", that consists on everything people upvote enough  Please?  I love random internet discussions, but only if they are going towards some kind of agreement.  Have a nice day. ‚ô•",‚ô•

t5_2s5w4,terari,1338724624,"&gt; PS, ""transgender"" is an adjective and not a noun.  Thank you for this correction, I'm not a native speaker. Apparently it is listed at some dictionaries as both noun and adjective (such as [here](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/transgender) and [here](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/transgender)). Transsexual seems to be in a similar situation (such as [here](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/transsexual))  Hmmm. But it turns out the issue is not so simple.  Wikitionary says:  &gt; Noun  &gt; transgender (usually uncountable; plural transgenders)  &gt; 1. (*now rare*) Transgenderism.  &gt; 2. (*sometimes considered offensive*) A transgender person.   and  &gt; It may be inappropriate to refer to or describe a transsexual person as ""a transsexual""; compare ""a black"", ""a gay"". ""A transsexual man"" (for a man who is biologically female, or was biologically female prior to sex reassignment) or ""a transsexual woman"" (for the reverse) is frequently more appropriate.  With the same notes for transgender.  Its inappropriateness is also reported by articles such as [this one](http://www.deeplyproblematic.com/2010/05/transgender-is-adjective-not-noun-or.html).  &gt; Transgender is not a noun. It is an adjective, and reducing people to just one of their qualities is necessarily reductive and denies their gender and their humanity.  and  &gt; Using transgender as a noun is occasionally an ignorant, symptomatic mistake made by a careless writer. But more often, it's an indicator of more issues: transgender or cross-dressing male to describe trans women, a she where a he is needed. It is indicative of a pattern of dehumanization, of degendering. How can a writer too lazy to check the AP style manual or question their own use of nouns and pronouns be trusted to write about trans issues?  This is a perspective I've never thought about, thanks. ‚ô•",‚ô•

Now my friend didn't really come from the best of families so the involvement of his parents in his life was slim to none which made what I did all the more easy. The morning while my friend was in the hospital I was back in school and was asked by peers and teachers where he was since his parents hadn't contacted the school. I then proceeded to tell them that we were outside of the movie theatre late that evening before, when a group of thugs showed up and began to harass us  I explained how matters escalated from bad to worse and that by the end of it my friend had been shot and I narrowly escaped while calling for help. I also mentiond that he was presumed dead at the scene before I was taken away.  I called my friend who was in a morphine drip from post op and explained the terrible but hilarious thing I did and he was in stitches with laughter... After he had recovered I'm sure the teachers had figured out he was ok and what really happened, but I had spurred a monster of a rumor of his death amongst the students in our school. Upon his arrival back to school students were mistified with disbelief of the previously deceaseds return.  My friend never told anyone about the appendix but instead told them verbatim the story of how he was shot and killed then revived later at the hospital.

In the comments section of the debate I messed around with them all. Stalking happened both ways, so I became friends with some of them on Facebook. Well it turns out they have this daily AIM group chat, and after about a week or two one of them invited me. Two to three weeks later, my SO and I started developing feelings for each other even though we had talked only a few times, and while others were there in the group chat with us...

t5_2qh6c,Jbdevery,1338854303,"Thank you!  I will address the many scriptures you quoted to answer your questions. But a Big factor that confuse many people is the different terms used in the Bible which people assume are the same. Such as the term Hades, or Hell, and the term Gehenna.   **Let us start with the lake of fire mentioned in Revelation.** This lake of Fire is mentioned throughout chapters 19-20 of Revelation. Who are hurled into this lake of fire?  The ""wild beast"" and the ""false prophet"" were hurled into the ""fiery lake that burns with sulpher."" The beast is referring to kingdoms or governments of the world, and the false prophet is not simply referring to one person but to a group. Since these are symbolic, it would not be surprising that it is not literal fire either. (Revelation 19:20) But also...  Death, [which will be no more (Rev 21:4)] and Hell, or Hades or the Grave of Mankind, were also thrown in the ""lake of Fire."" Death is not a tangible object, neither is the grave of mankind, so they could hardly be burned. (Revelation 20:14)   Also the Devil was hurled into the lake of fire. (Revelation 20:10)  &gt; In regards to Revelation 20:10, where it says 'tormented forever and ever, day and night' one reference work states: ""The Greek word used here for ‚Äútorment,‚Äù ba¬∑sa¬∑ni‚Ä≤zo, means primarily ‚Äúto test (metals) by the touchstone.‚Äù ‚ÄúTo question by applying torture‚Äù is a second meaning. (The New Thayer‚Äôs Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament) In the context, the use of this Greek word indicates that what happens to Satan will serve, for all eternity, as a touchstone on the issue of the rightness and righteousness...""  The Devil is a wicked angel. And even if he were cast into a Fiery pit, he could not be hurt by the fire, for he is a spirit being and is not physical. (Acts 7:30; Judg. 13:20; Ps. 104:4; Dan. 7:9, 10)  Back in Revelation 20:10, it finishes by saying, ""And death and Ha‚Ä≤des were hurled into the lake of fire. **This means the second death, the lake of fire.**""  The second death, like death, leaves one unconscious (Eccl 9:5). But the context suggest a more definite destruction, and everlasting destruction, with no hope of a resurrection.  The references in Revelation are clearing symbolic, especially when the lake of fire is defined in Rev 20:10.   **In the Gospels**  Matthew 25:41 is part of an illustration. Certainly the sheep and the Goats that Jesus spoke of were not literal. It would make sense that this fiery destruction would compare to that spoken of in Revelation.  But Matthew 25:41 is not the only place that a place of fire is mentioned by Jesus.   This is a section where the proper translation of the Term Gehenna, from the term Hades is important.  Many times Jesus associates fire with Gehenna, some Bible translators call Gehenna Hell.     &gt;Here is an example from an online Parallel Bible. (Matt 5:22) King James 2000 Bible (¬©2003)""... but whosoever shall say, You fool, shall be in danger of **hell fire**."" Young's Literal Translation ""... and whoever may say, Rebel! shall be in danger of the **gehenna of the fire.**""  What is Gehenna?  Gehenna is the Greek form of the Heb word, ""Geh Hin¬∑nom,"" or literally, ‚ÄúValley of Hinnom‚Äù.  God prophetically decreed that the Valley of Hinnom would serve as a place for mass disposal of dead bodies rather than for the torture of live victims. (Jer 7:32, 33; 19:2, 6, 7, 10, 11)   Jeremiah 31:40 spoke of ‚Äúthe low plain of the carcasses and of the fatty ashes,"" which is accepted as designating the Valley of Hinnom.  &gt;One Jewish commentator David Kimhi (1160-1235?), gave the following historical information: ‚ÄúAnd it is a place in the land adjoining Jerusalem, and it is a loathsome place, and they throw there unclean things and carcasses. Also there was a continual fire there to burn the unclean things and the bones of the carcasses. Hence, the judgment of the wicked ones is called parabolically Gehinnom.‚Äù  Luke 12:4,5 shows a difference between death, and being cast in Gehenna. Mat 10:28, similarly shows how you can be killed, and still be resurrected (destroy the body and not the soul, or not your life or chance to be resurrected [For god is the God of the living (Matt 22:32; Romans 4:16, 17) but not the body and soul in Gehenna).  Jesus also alluded to Isaiah 66:24 in describing Gehenna. He said it is a place ‚Äúwhere their maggot does not die and the fire is not put out.‚Äù (Mr 9:47, 48)  The symbolic picture here is not one of torture but, rather, of complete destruction. In Isaiah the text deals not with persons who were alive, but with ‚Äúthe carcasses of the men that were transgressing‚Äù against God.    *[There is also one parable about a Rich man and a man named Lazarus (Luke 16:22-24) which many will use to try to prove hellfire. But by examining the context and the entire account shows that it could not have been literal.*   *1. It would contradict Eccl 9:5 that the dead are conscious of nothing.*   *2. There is no statements that show the rich man was wicked, or that the poor one was righteous, if it was literal would this mean that the rich are all wicked and the poor all righteous?*  *3. They mention a drop of water cooling off the rich man in Hades, but if this were a literal fire, would a drop of water cool of the man in Hades, or would it even survive the heat?*   *4. Also, if the fire is literal, does that mean all righteous ones will be in the bosom of Abraham after death? (This parable showed how the Jewish religious leaders, pictured by the rich man, were self-righteous. Lazarus pictured the remnant of Jewish people of faith despised by the clergy and who were spiritually hungry. The death of the two men pictured a change in the two classes. Jesus tormented the clergy by exposing their greed and their false teachings and their hypocrisy. The clergy murdered Jesus. So the clergy came out of a luxurious condition into one of torment. But the remnant of faith had a change for the better. They received spiritual food, an opportunity to come into favorable relationship with the Greater Abraham, God)*    It is also good to note the accounts found in Jeremiah where God expressed repugnance for such practice of burning people, saying that it was ‚Äúa thing that I had not commanded and that had not come up into my heart‚Äù (Jer 7:31; 32:35)  Since something so similar to hellfire never came up into his heart, how could he of created a hellfire hundreds of years earlier?   In a nutshell, (which is hard to do.. haha..) the lake of fire is a symbol. Why?  1. When used in Revelation, symbols (wild beast), intangible ideas (death), and spirit creatures (Satan) are hurled into it. Fire can not affect any of these things, therefore it would not make sense for it to be literal fire.  2. Revelation defines the Lake of fire as the second death.  3. When Jesus refers to fiery torment he is either including it in parable or grouping it with symbols (sheep and goats - fiery destruction; Abraham's Bosom - Burning Hades)   4. Or Jesus is making reference to Gehenna, or the Valley of Hinnom, which did use fire to burn carcasses and waste. There even could of been a continual fire there as some references say. (He also was referencing Isaiah at one point, which clearly was speaking of ones already dead.)  5. If there was a lake of fire that tormented the wicked it would contradict the fact that the dead are unconscious (Eccl 9:5) and the fact that death as a punishment is used in contrast to everlasting life as a gift. (Ezek 18:4; Romans 6:23 - ""For the wages sin pays is death, but the gift God gives is everlasting life by Christ Jesus our Lord"")   Again, sorry for the length. If you have any further questions, ask away!            ",¬©

t5_2qh61,terari,1338926130,"Oh. I'm familiar with this point of view. For a long time I called ""GNU/Linux"" the operating systems that had Linux as kernel and ran a GNU userland. I would even argue nomenclature with strangers like you did now :)  But let me defend my vocabulary usage here:  &gt; I convinced maybe 10 or 20 people at university to install Linux.  In this sentence, ""Linux"" does not refer to the kernel Linux literally. (I know you know this. I'm just asserting it). This word, instead, is a [metonymy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metonymy). A metonymy is a figure of speech used when you call refer to something using the name of something else related to it. For example, when you call an operating system by its kernel or when you attribute an announcement of federal government to ""white house"". To illustrate, see this following Slashdot headline:  [White House Announces Initiative To Fight Botnets](http://slashdot.org/story/12/05/30/2242222/white-house-announces-initiative-to-fight-botnets)  In this usage, ""White House"" does not refer to the building itself, but it is a metonymy for the current administration of US federal government. The White House is actually a tiny part of the real estate controlled by the Obama administration; it is, however, a symbol of presidential authority.  The use of metonymies is justified linguistically (even though it may be [confusing](http://www.bellaonline.com/articles/art14294.asp)). There are two issues, now: if Linux is a legitimate metonymy for a whole OS containing it, and if it this specific usage is justified ethically: that is, if it is right or wrong to use the word ""Linux"" to refer to a operating system that contains Linux.  The concept of ethics of language might seem odd for some people (and specially for people unfamiliar with the [GNU/Linux naming controversy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU%2fLinux_naming_controversy)), but it is actually quite reasonable. For example, I recently discovered that the term ""tranny"", used to refer to trans women, is considered very offensive by such women (I am not a native English speaker). Because of this, I wouldn't normally use such term.  I don't, however, understand the term ""Linux"" as particularly offensive or damaging. You are right it that fails to give credit to some people that worked in important parts of the OS, but I don't see why my vocabulary choice should be directed at giving credit to them. They obviously deserve to get recognition; my suggestion is that they acquire it through other means.  I understand how my position may be considered subjective. If you feel pressured to give credit to the GNU project through your word choices, be welcome!  Now, the appropriateness of Linux as a metonymy is much more objective. It is a well understood term that convey the desired meaning to a large number of people. Even you, that didn't like this usage, understood what I meant. The goal of language is to convey meaning. Being well understood is reason enough to justify a linguistic construct. That explains why I decided to use ""Linux"" in that sentence.  Now, GNU/Linux is also a metonymy. That's because operating systems based on both GNU and Linux don't use solely those two components, and there are many operating systems based on both GNU and Linux. Its usage is also fine, but with a caveat: it does not refer exactly to the same set of operating systems. Android, for example, has Linux as an internal component but does not ship with GNU components.  This subject is actually pretty extensive and I didn't refute your arguments directly. If I had energy (and this text weren't so big already), I would dispute your notion that operating systems like Arch Linux or Gentoo are ""basically"" the GNU system.  Have a nice day. ‚ô•",‚ô•
t5_2qr7i,demmian,1338926787,"&gt;This is about people showing their support for the victims of sexual violence.   I believe this describes their intent better:  &gt;Co-creating a United Gender Movement, men will be a part of the solution to ending sexualized violence.   &gt;There is an old saying: ""You can't really understand another person's experience until you've walked a mile in their shoes."" Walk a Mile in Her Shoes¬Æ asks men to literally walk one mile in women's high-heeled shoes. It's not easy walking in these shoes, but it's fun and it gets the community to talk about something that's really difficult to talk about: gender relations and sexual violence.  &gt;Then You Talk the Talk  &gt;It's critical to open communication about sexualized violence. While hidden away, sexualized violence is immune to cure. Unfortunately, it's difficult to get people talking. People unfamiliar with sexualized violence don't even want to know it exists. It's ugly. People that have experienced sexualized violence themselves want to forget about it. How do you get people talking now, so they can prevent it from happening? And if it's already happened, how do you help them get help to recover?  &gt;A Walk a Mile in Her Shoes¬Æ Event is abundant with opportunities to get people talking. For preventive education, it helps men better understand and appreciate women‚Äôs experiences, thus changing perspectives, helping improve gender relationships and decreasing the potential for violence. For healing, it informs the community that services are available for recovery. It demonstrates that men are willing and able to be courageous partners with women in making the world a safer place. The Walk Event Experience provides a description of how these opportunities might present themselves at a Walk a Mile in Her Shoes¬Æ Event.    This whole initiative uses an event (try to experience how women walk) to promote awareness about sexualized violence and improve gender understanding and collaboration. There is no exclusivity in the discourse (only men/women can be victim/rapists). It may not be 100.000% politically correct, since they didn't qualify their message to avoid any possible misunderstanding, but they hardly promote anything discriminatory.",¬Æ

t5_2qhx4,KillerCalves,1338958548,"Like everyone else said... Yes it is doable.  This past Sunday, I ran my 10th half marathon. It is a life style change and you must take it seriously. From investing in a pair of good running shoes, to going to bed early for long runs...it' can be done.. There is nothing wrong with running X amount of time and then walking for a minute. I suggest looking at this as a life style change and not just a way to lose weight. There will be days that running is the last thing you want to do or days where it is easier than others. I use Hal Higdon's training schedule for the first few but I went out of my way and actually joined a running group. It was out of my comfort zone as I was not an avid runner and was slowest. But it really motivated me and I learned a lot about pace, nutrition through out training and during race day, dos/don't about running, speed work, technique and many other things. I also got a simple heart rate monitor to know what heart range should be while running.  That way, I didn't burn out during longer runs.   You can totally do it and will feel so proud of yourself afterwards. If it was an easy task, everyone would be out there running. üòä",üòä

t5_2qhn5,PUNKporVIDA,1339049183,"Free Press Summer Fest: A Clusterfuck. Sponsored by Jeep¬Æ    I've excitedly attended Free Press Summer Fests numbers one, three and four. However, so many things went wrong this year that I will not return no matter how good the booking is.   You Shall Not Pass:  The amount of space that FPSF let Jeep Purchase for their ""Off Road/Suspension Test Track"" was much too large. On Saturday it made getting from Stage 1 to Stage 2 a twenty minute ordeal. I understand that part of Houston culture is the acceptance of unreasonable amounts of traffic, and the general malaise that accompanies it. However, at a festival twenty minutes is not an admissible amount of time to move one city block. This is especially true when artists are playing back to back and patrons must optimize their schedules accordingly.  ""Work""? Hardly.  I did not have a single positive experience with anyone that worked at the festival. Competency clearly was not a factor in choosing those who represented FPSF. In addition, security was a joke. Both days my bag was not searched. On day one I could have very easily entered the festival without a ticket. I'm not sure if the employee was new to the idea of a bar code scanner, but the lines may as well have been self serve. I had to very nearly help the person scan my ticket.  Houston: The Gutter of Texas.  The complete and utter disregard for cleanliness and proper trash disposal at the fest was appalling. I saw several people slip and fall because trash was piled up so high in the walkways. To my knowledge some fests giveaway festival t-shirts to volunteers who collect trash. You should consider adopting this practice. Consider creative options like this to reduce the amount of garbage that cover the festival grounds. At the very least hire a greater staff of people who are dedicated to garbage collection.  The Infamous Golf Cart:  I've already talked about what a nightmare the Jeep Ad created to the flow of traffic. The golf carts that were added to the mix turned the annoying bottleneck into an impasse. There was one golf cart driver in particular who was exceedingly bold. This gentleman drove his golf cart THROUGH THE CROWD at stage 5 several times while various artists were performing. Not only was this incredibly disrespectful to the artists; it was also unacceptably inconsiderate to the ticket purchasing attendees.  Afrojack &gt; Flaming Lips? Srsly?  Rookie Mistake.   In summation, While I did enjoy many of the musical acts that I witnessed at FPSF 4. The amount and magnitude of annoyances were enough to destroy my desire to attend this festival again. Ever.",¬Æ

You could have said it about Newtonian mechanics too, 200 years ago. It's pretty unconvincing.  &gt; **While genetically identical**, ergo they‚Äôre still the same lizards, the new lizards on the island were larger, but with shorter rear legs, a lower run speed, and a lessened response to potential predators. All of this because of a diet shift to plant focus, and significant gains in foliage protection. **These lizards reproduced like wild fire, and over a 30 year period developed huge adaptations that, because they allowed the lizard to survive better, were passed on to new lizards, and became normal traits**.  You contradicted yourself.

Before I begin, like with any sect of Christianity, there are strict places and there are liberal places. I am in The Netherlands, so my answers might be leaning more to the liberal side.  Socializing with non-believers is discouraged but not forbidden. This goes for professional and private association. The idea is that people on the inside are *obviously* much better association since they believe the same thing.  Disagreeing with doctrines is something I think a lot of Witnesses do, but they'll never talk about it and will deny it in the strongest possible terms. You can't actually disagree in the open, because the overarching organization claims that they have a direct link to God. Doubting their words would mean doubting God.  Witnesses can't get involved in wars, politics and patriotism. Once I saw an article that basically said: ""You *may* vote, but True Christians¬Æ would not due this because x, y and z.""  Running for leadership within the JWs is encouraged as long as ""running"" means doing your stinking best to adhere to the rules. First you'll get so-called ""privileges"", which means you get to distribute magazines or take care of the sound in their churches (known to them as Kingdom Halls). Reaching a higher position in an outside organization is allowed but not encouraged because it takes away time from worship and going door-to-door.  Arms for self-protection are not allowed either because guns kill and killing is bad. Any True Christian¬Æ would therefore avoid guns at all costs, including any professions that require you to carry arms.  Gambling, smoking, tattoos, piercings and getting drunk is forbidden. In fact, people who are on the outside are often depicted in their pictures as people who do that all the time. Anything with blood transfusions is forbidden as well, even if it kills you, though over the past few decades those rules have become more lenient. Yoga is considered to be opening your mind to demons. Pretty much all this eastern stuff is considered religious and therefore demonic.  Reading publications from other religions is not forbidden but only if it is done so you can prepare yourself to refute it. Reading apostate literature is forbidden. The organization is very tight on information control, you see. Supporting other churches is a no-no too because those are different religions and therefore part of Satan's world.  Marriage is considered holy and only done in the city hall with a speech before or after by a member in their local Kingdom Hall. The only valid reasons to divorce is death and cheating on your spouse. You can be homosexual, just don't you dare act on it.  Christian/Patriotic holidays may not be observed, except their own single holiday that remembers the death of Jesus Christ.   I'm at rule 100, but I am tired of going through it now, so I hope you got the picture.",¬Æ

t5_2tkk8,bongface,1339121487,"It's good you're wanting to wean off the subs.  It seems like some people who are on a long-term course have a very hard time getting off, or end up with nasty after-effects.  I feel like suboxone really should be used as ""short"" term therapy with tapering and then discontinuation as the immediate goal, and not as long term maintenance like methadone.  I want to avoid giving ""medical advice"" since I can't back it up with anything that isn't anecdotal, but with buprenorphine I'd say weekly reductions are reasonable.  The feelings of ""normalization"" that some people get from bupe can be difficult to let go of, so it's be good to give your mind and body time to acclimate while tapering your dose.  Since you're using a relatively low dose (compared to what is often prescribed to heavy users), it shouldn't take you too long to get off.  I'd start by figuring out your lowest ""functional"" dose and sticking with it for, say, a week.  Do not let yourself take anything higher than that stated dose.  No excuses or exceptions.  This should help you get in the mindset that you'll need from here on out without assaulting your body quite yet.  I'd then move to 75% of that dose for a week, and 50% the week after.  Then halve that dose each week until you're taking an absurdly small amount of material.  For the smoothest transition I'd go until you're taking just a speck each day.  When you reach a week where it seems unreasonable to halve your dose, stop taking it.  How easy this is might depend on if you have the strips or tablets though.  I've never encountered the tablets, but I'd think that crushing them and dividing the powder shouldn't be TOO hard.  It may be easier to manage your dose my making a solution however.  For example you could dissolve 1mg for every 5ml of water, and divide your doses accordingly.  If you do this, be sure to not use too much liquid as you want to be able to easily hold it under your tongue.  I'd keep it there for at least 15min before swallowing, occasionally moving it around to make sure everything absorbs.  Accurate measurement is key to maintaining the correct dose too.  A small needless syringe with volumetric markings would be good, though an adjustable-volume pipette would be better.  There are many sources of information on what to do with yourself after you're done, and I'll leave that advice to better authorities.  I only just read ThrowAwayBroadway's response on here, and there's a lot of good info there.  I will add a couple suggestions though.  I'm all about herbal and nutritional supplementation, they really can do a lot of good.  A quality magnesium supplement helps relax muscles, regulate a stressed nervous system, and can relieve constipation (Magnesium Citrate is sold for this very purpose).  I believe Magnesium Chelate is the best, especially for reaching muscle, brain, and nerve tissue.  Gycinate, Gluconate, and Citrate should be good too.  Don't bother with the Oxide.  A balanced calcium/magnesium/phosphorus supplement is not a bad idea either, but most have a larger proportion of calcium than you probably want.  Epsom salts (Magnesium Sulfate) are great for both a nice relaxing bath.  Taking too much magnesium can cause or worsen diarrhea though.  If that happens I'd add a calcium supplement.  For sleep and relaxation try valerian or kava kava.  Chamomile, hops, passion flower, sublingual GABA, and L-theanine are good too.  Melatonin can also work wonders for inducing sleep and correcting your sleep cycle, plus it's neuroprotective.  I definitely recommend it.  Extended, regular use becomes ineffective though so it's better just to use it to get your cycle back on track.  If you need an alternative to prescription benzodiazapines, maybe try phenibut.  Some people find that kratom is an effective opiate replacement (it seems to have mu-Opioid receptor activity), but tread carefully as you can get addicted to that instead.  A multivitamin is probably good, though personally I feel like many formulas are not great.  Vitamin C and a B-complex are probably the most useful.  With any of those supplements it's important to use a high quality product.  Most store brands are complete shit.  For example I've found HerbPharm's glycerine based valerian extract to be quite effective, but I took 16 store bought capsules of root powder and felt nothing.

t5_2qh1o,amikez,1339133309,"Ok, I wasn't going to respond, but I feel the previous sentiment requires some clarification.  To be clear, the original 'put it outside' was part joke, part serious, and part troll (I'm not proud).  Obviously, this is an incredibly young puppy and I'm assuming mom and/or siblings are not around, and I would NOT seriously advocate putting this young of a puppy outside by itself.  If my original comment was taken as completely serious, then I apologize for not using the '/s' tag.  First and foremost, I have **loved** all the dogs I have owned and trained over the years.  From the pit bulls to ridgebacks, border collies, labs, german shorthairs, and the mutts.  Have loved them all.  Favorite has to be pit bulls, they are fantastic and loving family dogs and they get a bad rep.  It irks me to no end that some towns actually ban the breed (other rant for another time).  But sleeping on the ground with your puppy is generally NOT the answer.  I'm glad to hear that OP's puppy has taken to their crate training without issue after the first couple nights, that is FANTASTIC, but an atypical route.  Encouraging your dog to cry for attention (even itty bitty puppies) is usually a recipe for disaster.  In this instance it is not, so I leave it.  Second, dogs - despite all the love we all heap on them - are NOT family/friends.  They can't make you a cup of coffee, they can't send an email for you, and they can't offer you advice on relationships, work, or life in general.  You know who can do all/any of those things?  ACTUAL family and friends.  Granted, it might not be good advice or good coffee or a proper missive, but this is more about ability than quality.  Dogs are NOT your kids and should never receive the same kind of love that your kids do.  The first two years might seem the same, but there needs to be a mental separation made; dogs (pets) =/= family (humans).  Do they deserve protection from abuse and some basic rights, like not be killed for simply being unowned? Of course.  Do they need to sleep on your bed or share your ice cream cone? No.  That all said, my serious advice for a puppy of this age that wouldn't stop crying would be to crate it or put it in a pen of its own with food, water, training pad, and thick blanket or personal dog bed.  **tl:dr** Don't actually put your 6 week old puppy outside by itself, I was joking, sorry I wasn't clear.

t5_2qmeb,imawaffle,1339136271,"I'll have to disagree. My, personal, dislike for Gen III and up, is a lack of creativity. The Pokemon franchise has amazing potential to create awesome games, that can appeal to a variety of peoples tastes. But instead, let's just spam more Pokemon, give it the same storyline, same antagonists, make pokemon based on inatament(spelling?) objects, and shut down any third parties that even think of using Pokemon¬Æ to make a better game.  Could you imagine a sandbox rpg, pokemon style? How about an mmo, not compared to WoW? Hell, let's simply alter the storyline and give someone a new perspective to Pokemon besides 8 badges, 'x' amount of pokemon, follow the yellow brick road.  I would love to be able to role play Pokemon. But that just isn't possible with any of these games. You must follow the path laid before you, or you'll find yourself with nothing to do. I don't wanna have to catch HM whores. I wanna be able to play like *I* would live in a Pokemon world. A noncompetetive person just raising a companion that will come around with me while I do whatever I feel like doing. A game that gives me, and others like me, the freedom to enjoy rp-ing, and gives others the freedom to be competitive, if they so choose.  Not because of nostalgia, no.

t5_2rgfg,amosko,1339169283,"This is an article from this months NASW newspaper about non-traditional routes in social work   &gt;JUNE 2012 &gt;Vol. 57, No. 6     &gt;Social work schools offering alternative job path programs  &gt;By Rena Malai, News Staff  &gt;To boost the employment potential for newly graduated or currently enrolled MSW students, some schools of social work across the U.S. offer dual degrees and nontraditional career path programs that take advantage of the broad spectrum of skills social workers can offer.  &gt;‚ÄúBecause of the uncertain economy, shrinking job market, and desire to provide a greater array of MSW internship and employment options, the (University of Southern California) School of Social Work found the need to be creative in identifying these types of opportunities for students and alumni,‚Äù said Carrie Lew, USC administrator.  &gt;The USC School of Social Work's nontraditional social work job project gives students a chance to expand their career prospects by finding nontraditional social work internships, or NTSWs, Lew said.  &gt;‚ÄúIt was Dean Marilyn Flynn‚Äôs vision to move into the ‚Äònontraditional‚Äô social work job market,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThe project expands employment options for MSWs by exposing them to NTSW internships available in areas that are experiencing growth in today‚Äôs challenging economy ... ‚Äù  &gt;Some of these areas are fundraising/fund development, marketing, quality control and social entrepreneurship, she added.  &gt;It‚Äôs a common misconception that a social worker is limited to just one field of practice, said Florence Chung, a senior business partner for Target Corp.‚Äôs assets protection division and a mentor in the USC nontraditional social work project.  &gt;‚ÄúSocial workers are trained to think a certain way, and they‚Äôre qualified for many fields,‚Äù said Chung, who has an MSW. ‚ÄúWe can do so many things to impact the community in many different ways, such as working in policy and getting involved with local community outreach opportunities.‚Äù  &gt;Norma Bravo, who found her internship at Pan American Bank through USC‚Äôs project, sees pursuing a nontraditional social work path as opening up new career opportunities. Social work students come from all walks of life, she said, and have the ability to combine their skills and transfer them into nontraditional jobs.  &gt;‚ÄúThe idea of a social worker in nontraditional placement is intriguing for many people,‚Äù Bravo said. ‚ÄúManagement, consulting, financial and life coaching, business-social enterprise, education, human resources, law, marketing and fundraising are some of the nontraditional fields (where) social workers can find employment.‚Äù  &gt;Dual degrees  &gt;Dual degree programs offered at schools of social work are another way to open new career paths for MSW graduates.  &gt;‚ÄúOne of the dual degrees we offer at our school of social work is in urban planning, for example, in addition to our other programs,‚Äù said Mike Spencer, associate dean and professor of social work at the University of Michigan. ‚ÄúThe (dual degrees) can double job prospects for an MSW graduate.‚Äù  &gt;‚ÄúThere are various reasons students seek a joint degree with their MSW education,‚Äù said Melissa Bottiglio, associate director of admissions and recruitment at the School of Social Policy &amp; Practice at the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn). ‚ÄúSocial work is already an interdisciplinary field with scholars having differing career goals or desires to create change in particular sectors of society.‚Äù  &gt;Bottiglio said bioethics is one dual degree social work program UPenn offers, which can extend opportunities in the health care sector for graduates.  &gt;‚ÄúThe MSW/MBE (Master of Social Work/Master of Bioethics) aims to prepare students to be leaders in bioethics-related, research-based program and policy venues in the social services, life sciences and medicine,‚Äù Bottiglio said. ‚ÄúThe MBE program is designed to provide its graduates with the interdisciplinary training they will need in order to address the moral challenges in health care today and tomorrow.‚Äù  &gt;Perfecta Lancenski, a student enrolled in the MSW/Master of Public Administration program at UPenn, says obtaining a dual degree in social work sets her up to tackle a wide array of social issues she may come across in any position she gets.  &gt;‚ÄúHaving both degrees allows me to have a more holistic understanding of social problems as well as practical skills in how to address them,‚Äù Lancenski said. ‚ÄúAnd given how complex and seemingly intractable social problems can be, I‚Äôm glad I feel more prepared.‚Äù  From June 2012 NASW News. ¬© 2012 National Association of Social Workers.",¬©

Battle.net Balance and Authenticator Update With the introduction of the real-money auction house, account security will become more important than ever. To help ensure that players have a positive experience when using the real-money auction house, we‚Äôve made some adjustments to how players can use and access their Battle.net Balance.   Starting today, in order to use Battle.net Balance, players will be required to have a Battle.net Authenticator or Battle.net Mobile Authenticator attached to their Battle.net account. For clarity, this means you‚Äôll need to have an Authenticator to add to your balance via Battle.net Account Management or to send the proceeds of your real-money auction house sales to your Battle.net Balance.  Please note that players who previously added Battle.net Balance to their account prior to this change will be able to use it to make eligible purchases on Battle.net and in the auction house without attaching an Authenticator. However, an Authenticator will be required to add to your balance in the future, as explained above.  While we understand that this may be an inconvenience for some players, we want to ensure that players feel confident when using Battle.net Balance to make auction house transactions.   You can learn more about the Battle.net Authenticator, Battle.net Mobile Authenticator, and other account security information by clicking here.",¬Æ

t5_2qh1i,meatwad75892,1339175833,"1. Yes, we do.  Beer pong is to drinking as baseball is to sports.  It's a great past-time, some American kids start playing in high school and it continues through college, so the game itself is quite nostalgic for some. It's always extremely fun to play, but rarely fun to watch.  While it is counter-intuitive to make someone else drink, but it's usually fun to make other people get drunk, especially when it's their own drinks. If you're a ""good player"", as I *think* I am, I usually have a side drink to make up for what I don't drink in the game. About 1 beer per game if they go by quickly.   2. Yep, true stereotype I guess.  It's also less incriminating if you're out at a bonfire or something and a county sheriff rolls up. It's easier to toss a red cup than try to explain 10 empty Budweiser cans around you.  And if you bring any other brand of cups other than Solo, odds are you will be hated and picked on for it. Solo has the perfect height, width, weight, balance, and durability that store-brands and other brands just can't rival.   3. If someone is worried about wasted beer or money, they probably shouldn't be buying kegs in the first place. No one likes a Beer Nazi. My deal is, let everyone try and have a good time!  If you supply alcohol, don't bitch and gripe when people use it.  If I throw a party, it's usually BYOB(bring your own beer). But maybe twice a year, I have a big blowout where I save up and supply everything. Everyone is my guest, no one goes thirsty and no one is told ""no"" in their own personal alcolympics.   4. I live in Mississippi. Bars in city limits shut down at 1am, and bars outside city limits close at 3am.  [Waffle House](http://www.wafflehouse.com/) is a 50/50 chance afterwards, it depends on whether or not someone in your group is too trashed or missing or bleeding to death.   5. Pretty much any ""light"" beer is insanely popular for binge drinking.  People will gripe over Bud Light, Miller Lite, Coors Light, etc. Some people will drink one religiously, and never touch the other. It's quite funny to watch because they're all shit at the end of the day.  For casual drinking, many people do thankfully go for better beers and microbrews.

t5_2qh13,Pokaris,1339184371,"1. And? That doesn't prove Monsanto did anything to be responsible other than participate in the cycle. You might as well blame anyone that uses herbicide.  2. ""Super weeds"" is term used by individuals who didn't understand there were resistant weeds prior and are looking for a scapegoat. Good to know you fall into that crowd. Again, how does that prove any responsibility on Monsanto's part?  3. There are other herbicides out there, invented by other companies. Different is not more. Appropriate herbicide use does not ""poison"" the land. Poisoned ground won't grow crops so that would be problematic for farmers. Your entire assertion here is completely false.  4. You've not refuted anything I've said, only ignored it. That's not how intelligent debate works.  You may have noticed how they recently released RoundReady2 and RoundUp 2. Monsanto knew it would happen and had a product sitting on the shelves to sell when it did. Almost like they're really good at this, isn't it? Shocking how people that do something are better at it than those that sit around making stuff up.  Did you even read your second link? It specifically mentions a weed with triple resistance, none of which are Monsanto caused.  http://www.extension.purdue.edu/extmedia/gwc/gwc-1.pdf ""Waterhemp infests millions of Midwest corn and soybean acres, and most waterhemp populations are already resistant to ALS-inhibitingherbicides (Raptor¬Æ, Pursuit¬Æ, and others). There are also waterhemp populations resistant to PPO herbicides (Flexstar¬Æ, Cobra¬Æ, and others) and triazine herbicides (Sencor¬Æ, atrazine, and others). One Illinois farm has a waterhemp population with three-way resistance (ALS, PPO, and triazine). All the resistance and it's not glyphosate resistant. ....But, but, but Monsanto is the boogeyman  So yet again, you've contradicted yourself. It's now moved beyond uneducated, to simply sad. You have no idea what you are talking about but have convinced yourself you know where to place blame.  The only silence is happening between your ears where most people have intelligent thoughts.   Thanks for not reading your links, saves me from having to link to stuff that proves you wrong. Since you don't seem to get this, I'm not arguing that there are no weeds resistant to glyphosate/RoundUp, I'm saying weed resistance happened before Monsanto and to act like they deserve the blame is idiotic.",¬Æ

Designed with both Professional and Club DJs in mind, the Denon DJ SC2900 steps-up to the booth with a fresh take on true digital-media versatility. No longer is there a need to struggle dragging a mass of CDs to the club or through the studio doors ‚Äì the SC2900 includes playback from USB drives and offers the ability to share one USB stick over (up to) four networked Denon DJ SC2900 or SC3900s. However, traditional CD DJs and producers can still make the most of the front mounted CD slot, and pure software DJs can utilise the Traktor 2 compatibility* to mix and produce.   ‚ÄòENGINE inside‚Äô ensures compatibility with ENGINE software ‚Äì a unique combination of software and hardware that empowers todays DJs with high speed access and control over their extensive digital music libraries. Leaving the ENGINE software to manage the set from a USB connected, or networked, PC or MAC and the hard work down to the player itself ‚Äì reducing the need for a super-powerful computer to manage the DJs performance.  What set‚Äôs the Denon DJ SC2900 apart from the conventional ‚Äúclub CDJ‚Äù is its leap forward in display technologies with the introduction of the ‚ÄòEclipse‚Äô platter with glowing LED markers that surround the circumference; enabling a very clear and elegant method of accurately displaying ‚ÄòCue Point‚Äô and ‚ÄòPlayback‚Äô markers. Combined with the ENGINE for iPad¬Æ App means that a networked iPad becomes the biggest and most versatile media navigation screen in the industry, giving every DJ a powerful way to manage tracks and playlists, ready to perform, all through the iPad touchscreen.  The button layout reflects that of the popular SC3900 with a bank of Loops and Cues top left of the platter for throwing down samples and top right are the navigation controls ensuring the fastest access to the DJing essentials. Similarly reflecting the same newly redesigned ‚ÄòHard‚Äô Cue and Play buttons with the only significant layout change to be the ‚ÄòSLIP‚Äô button which replaces the SC3900s ‚ÄòDUMP‚Äô button: for reverse, loop, and scratch whilst continuing playback at the same rhythm and point that would have been reached prior to pushing ‚Äòslip‚Äô ‚Äì an essential editing feature in the studio and the booth for dropping out inappropriate lyrics without disturbing the flow of music.   Denon DJs heritage in Professional DJ Equipment married with new developments in software leaves the SC2900 as a true consideration in the Professional, Studio and Club DJ market. From the more traditional CD DJs, through portable USB media and connectivity to the latest in software or even network sharing makes the Denon DJ SC2900 the choice, whatever the style of DJ and whatever the occasion.

If she is going to confront her parents on this (and she has every right to do so), it may be wiser for her to wait until she is independent financially.

Yeah, it says something about being chained up in prison and beaten by very large people with leather masks for 200 years. Um... fine, you got us. We have no idea what federal laws are actually governing web content. We would've actually had a real lawyer come up with this tag, but man are they expensive. Like waaaay more money than anybody involved with this website could possibly ever afford. We're poor people, despite having what might called ""successful"" careers in the information technology arena. Do you have any idea how much student loan payments can actually cost a person? Two words come to mind: ""Poverty"" and ""Turkey sandwich."" Hmm... come to think of it, a turkey sandwich doesn't really have anything to do with paying school loans, but I'm still pretty hungry. Oh! I found this fantastic deli downtown, that just got put in on the corner of Garden and West. You know, where the old alligator repair shop used to be? Yeah, that place went out of business. Surprisingly, it wasn't because of a lack of customers. I hear the owner, Mr. Phlegm, was involved in some sort of international conspiracy that had something to do with all those Russian exchange students that were arrested last month. So he got taken off to jail or something and they tore down the alligator repair shop, which kind of irks me because my alligator was still in there. It was giving me problems, so I gave it to Mr. Phlegm, and he told me it was nothing serious, like a couple of loose belts and maybe a rusted sparkplug or two. Well, he had to order the parts and stuff so he told me it wouldn't be ready until Tuesday, and then all of a sudden guys from the CIA are asking him to go with them to Washington. At least, I think they were with the CIA. My friends tell me that everybody in the CIA wears a black ski mask. One of the guys had pantyhose on his head, so I guess he was probably with the FBI. I'm pretty sure everybody in the FBI carries a flamethrower, and I know for a fact that they always set fire to people when they arrest them. I guess it was pretty important that they knew who I was, because they asked for my wallet to make sure I had proper identification. I don't want anybody from the CIA thinking I'm some sort of conspirator, so I handed it right over and the nice guy from the FBI hit me in the stomach with a tire iron. At that point I guess I fell asleep, because the next thing I knew I was waking up in a hospital bed with a really bad headache and my legs in traction. That's when I met the wonderful person who changed my life... a beautiful nurse that would be my ray of sunshine in my darkest days. I'll never forget that nurse's name: Stewart. She was about three feet tall, with a full red beard and a creamy nougat center. I didn't mind that she had seven extra knuckles on her left pointer finger, I'm willing to put aside petty differences if it means true love. Stewart and I eventually moved to the new apartment complex on Elmwood Drive where we rent a smashing two bedroom bungalow with satellite dishwasher access and a remote control shower.

It is not bad but since people were botting and buying gold from farmers most players that were not farming find that they are very poor. It will be MUCH BIGGER when RMAH goes online since farmers were saving most gold for this.

With easy power leveling and farming people could get to level 60 with cool eq very quickly and join hunt for the best items ever or get enough gear for PvP later. Now they will spend a lot time and feel stupid for taking all this effort.  Playing legit, even as team that doesn't use AH is awesome. I like it and I had teams that didn't power through game in D2.

Oh! I found this fantastic deli downtown, that just got put in on the corner of Garden and West. You know, where the old alligator repair shop used to be? Yeah, that place went out of business. Surprisingly, it wasn't because of a lack of customers. I hear the owner, Mr. Phlegm, was involved in some sort of international conspiracy that had something to do with all those Russian exchange students that were arrested last month. So he got taken off to jail or something and they tore down the alligator repair shop, which kind of irks me because my alligator was still in there. It was giving me problems, so I gave it to Mr. Phlegm, and he told me it was nothing serious, like a couple of loose belts and maybe a rusted sparkplug or two. Well, he had to order the parts and stuff so he told me it wouldn't be ready until Tuesday, and then all of a sudden guys from the CIA are asking him to go with them to Washington. At least, I think they were with the CIA. My friends tell me that everybody in the CIA wears a black ski mask. One of the guys had pantyhose on his head, so I guess he was probably with the FBI. I'm pretty sure everybody in the FBI carries a flamethrower, and I know for a fact that they always set fire to people when they arrest them. I guess it was pretty important that they knew who I was, because they asked for my wallet to make sure I had proper identification. I don't want anybody from the CIA thinking I'm some sort of conspirator, so I handed it right over and the nice guy from the FBI hit me in the stomach with a tire iron. At that point I guess I fell asleep, because the next thing I knew I was waking up in a hospital bed with a really bad headache and my legs in traction. That's when I met the wonderful person who changed my life... a beautiful nurse that would be my ray of sunshine in my darkest days. I'll never forget that nurse's name: Stewart. She was about three feet tall, with a full red beard and a creamy nougat center. I didn't mind that she had seven extra knuckles on her left pointer finger, I'm willing to put aside petty differences if it means true love. Stewart and I eventually moved to the new apartment complex on Elmwood Drive where we rent a smashing two bedroom bungalow with satellite dishwasher access and a remote control shower.

On Windows, keyboard shortcuts are divided haphazardly between Ctrl and Alt when there's no real reason to do so. The Windows key is sort of there, and has the occasional handy use (like the Aero Snap shortcuts), but is mostly vestigial.  On OS X, nearly all keyboard shortcuts are on the Command key, with Ctrl and Alt modifying Command key shortcuts. This frees up the other two keys to do incredibly useful things that are a pain in the ass on other operating systems. For example, the Ctrl key can be used system-wide with a variety of Emacs text-editing shortcuts. If I want to go to the beginning or end of a line, or back or forward a character on any Mac, my fingers never have to leave the home row, whereas on a Windows system I have to lift my right hand and move it over to that awkward home/end/arrowkey conglomerate.  Likewise, on OS X, Alt is used for accessing alternate glyphs when typing. For example, Alt-g produces ¬©, Alt-e gives the next typed character a forward accent (as in √≠, produced by Alt-e, i), etc. How do you produce those same characters on Windows?

t5_2qio8,koviko,1339266628,"**tl;dr** Depends on how well you can avoid damage. If you can avoid most if not all damage, you want low resil. If you can't, you want high resil. In arena, Arcane 4.5k+, Fire 4k+, Frost 3k+.  ##How does resilience work?  Resilience reduces the amount of damage that you take from enemy players in PvP. Back in the day, it used to reduce your chance of getting crit, but Blizzard changed it to be a pure damage reduction. Basically, **1% resilience** makes you take **1% less damage** from an enemy player. This is applied after all other things are considered (power of the attacker, armor and resistances of the victim, etc). At max level, 1% resilience is a little less than 100 resilience rating. For simplification, assume that 1% is 100 resilience rating. So, 2000 resilience reduces incoming attacks by about 20% and 4000 resilience reduces incoming attacks by about 40%.  The simplest way to show the value of this is that if you take 40% less damage, you survive 40% longer without any healing. Once you count healing into the equation, you have to consider that heals only matter if you are still alive. As long as you are above 0% health, you are eligible for healing. The longer you can stay alive, the more heals you can receive.  ##Resilience for ranged classes  Ranged classes are meant to be high-damage/low-defense classes (with the exception of Hunters being medium-defense, but having very few damage mitigation and healing techniques). The amount of resilience you need becomes a matter of how many times you will get hit. This means that **the harder it is to hit you, the less resilience you need** in order to stay above 0% health. Warriors get hit the entire time they are in combat, so they require high resilience. However, Rogues are able to avoid a lot of damage, so many opt for low resilience.  The tradeoff is damage ‚Üî resilience. If you are trading resilience for a different defensive stat, then you are wasting your time since resilience would be more beneficial. You want to trade resilience for damage, as that is the key to theoretically ""reducing"" the damage you take by killing your opponent. A dead opponent does 0 DPS.  When you are at range, you should theoretically be able to avoid damage easier than a melee class. As such, you want to embrace your high-damage by trading resilience for more damage. However, this isn't always the case. For example, Warlocks are a ranged class who's primary deflector for avoiding damage is Fear, but diminishing returns can reduce it's effectiveness to 0 after the third Fear. At this point, if they don't have a well-placed teleport available, they will find themselves taking a lot more damage than intended/  ##When you need resilience and when you do not  As a Mage, it is tricky to definitively say how much resilience you need. The idea is that, if you are going to get hit a lot, you need a lot of resilience. If not, you don't. However, this changes depending on the setting.  In random Battlegrounds, you will find it easy to hide behind other players, almost to the point that you never get attacked at all. If you can avoid all attacks altogether, then you don't need any resilience at all. You can sit in the back spamming Arcane Blast in full Heroic T13 gear and end up with better stats than the rest of the players in the battleground.  In Rated Battlegrounds, the amount of resilience depends on how likely of a target you are and how easily you can be saved. If you draw a lot of attention to yourself (overextending, playing Arcane, getting big Combustions), then you will become a prime target. If not, then you can get away with more damage. I find low resilience in RBGs only really works as Frost though, and even then, you only use low resilience for big fights and then switch back to your high resilience gear when defending a node.  In Arenas, you want higher resilience. Depending on your spec, the exact amount will differ depending on how easily you can avoid damage. **You will always be a target in Arenas**, so you have to be able to protect yourself. Arcane will have trouble avoiding damage, so you want a high amount of resilience (around 4.5k). As Fire, you will find yourself taking damage from melee occasionally, so you want a decent amount of resilience  to allow you to tank a few hits (4k ish). As Frost, your freezes can be utilized to avoid most melee damage and your Ice Barrier will protect you from most ranged damage, so you can get away with low resilience (3k ish). However, if you find yourself getting trained by Rogue/Druids catching you while they are stealthed, then you may opt for higher resilience in order to survive their openers.",‚Üî

These include sympatry with a compatible relative (weedy, wild or crop), synchrony of flowering, successful fertilization and viable offspring. The chance of these events occurring is real; however, it is generally low and varies with species and circumstances. Plants of the same species (non-transgenic or with a different HR transgene) in neighbouring fields may inherit the new HR gene, potentially generating plants with single and multiple HR. For canola, seed losses at harvest and secondary dormancy ensures the persistence over time of the HR trait(s) in the seed bank, and the potential presence of crop volunteers in subsequent crops. Although canola has many wild/weedy relatives, the risk of gene flow is quite low for most of these species, except with Brassica rapa L. Introgression of genes and transgenes in B rapa populations occurs with apparently little or no fitness costs. Consequences of HR canola gene flow for the agro-ecosystem include contamination of seed lots, potentially more complex and costly control strategy, and limitations in cropping system design. Consequences for non-agricultural habitats may be minor but appear largely undocumented.

t5_2qh2n,danceswithronin,1339295548,"&gt; No, it actually was an insult from it. Corrina is picturing the ship as saying, ""Fly me through a storm, you pricks? Take that!"" and crashes into the wall. Could I change that to make it more clear?  Yeah, I think it could use clarification, using ^ that right there. Like so: Corrina imagined the airship saying, *Fly* me *through a storm, you pricks? How about this then?*  &gt; I suppose that trope does get used a lot... should I drop it altogether?  Yeah, I think it's a bit overdone just because it's used in *so* many fantasy novels. If you establish in other parts of the book that it is common practice with this particular group of people, then I don't think it would be as distracting. But it does get used a lot. The decision to keep it or not is up to you, I just thought I'd mention it. I didn't know if all of the characters had last names like that or not, but if they don't it's probably not as much of an issue.   &gt; Do you feel like this was happening in this chapter or just on the brink of it? Artemis had an Arkadyan accent, but people from Giralda (and the surrounding kingdoms) won't have much of an accent. Do you feel like I should tone it down?  Just be mindful of it. I really enjoyed the vocabulary a lot and thought it gave a lot of cool flavor to the story. It's a good hand, just don't overplay it.   &gt; Anyway, thank you sooo much for taking the time to read this, and for having something nice to say. You always give such great advice here, and the fact that you liked it really makes me feel better. I've tried and failed so many times before that it feels amazing to finally understand what I was doing wrong. Thanks again! ‚ô•  No problem! I would totally read the rest of this book, in a heartbeat. (I'm a sucker for airships, what can I say?) I thought Nahira's character in particular was really well-drawn and intriguing.

It's kind of embarrassing for me to admit, but last year, I was in a really terrible place in life emotionally/mentally. I began drinking heavily almost every weekend, Thursday night through Sunday night, to cope. One Friday night, I drank waaay beyond my limit, and the doctor said something about I might have possibly been drugged (I'm fuzzy on the details because of how medicated I was). My friends called my boyfriend who came with his father (a doctor) and they took me to the hospital. I spent the majority of the weekend in an induced coma. I was told my BAC was .217. Looking back on it, I just feel stupid. I feel shame for having done that to myself. I've blacked out more times than I'd like to admit, and as fucking stupid as it sounds, almost dying from the alcohol poisoning wasn't enough to stop me from drinking. I've cut back recently but still have my nights that turn into regrets the next day. Every day is a battle, I suppose.  Onto the suicide attempt: after coming home from the hospital that Sunday evening, I was still so heavily medicated that I barely remember this happening. That Monday night, I attempted to hang myself, but failed somehow and texted my friend about it, who texted my boyfriend, who called my mom. My mother, stepfather, and boyfriend drove me to the emergency room, and I was admitted to the psych ward the next morning. I spent Tuesday through Friday morning there and was home in time that Friday to attend my senior prom :)  It's been over a year and I wish I could say I came out on top and am living so much happier now but honestly, it's not true. Yes, I am doing better in some instances, but like I previously said, every day is a battle.  As anonymous as this is, stranger to stranger, I'm happy you're still around.

Racism isn't just a synonym for racial superiority. The comment section of a post about MLG isn't quite the place to have a real conversation about this but let's just say that me being who I am (a warcraft/starcraft nerd from the almost-not-quite-hood) I've had a disproportionate amount of experience with the type of suburban white kid from a monochromatic neighborhood who could easily read this an truly believe ""Well, yeah, it makes sense that there aren't a lot of black SC2 players because they can't afford games, subscriptions, and computers.""  Are there a lot of black people who can't? Yes. Are there a lot of white people that can't? Yes. If I said ""There aren't a lot of white superstar basketball players because white people just aren't that good at basketball and aren't as athletic"", that argument would be just as specious.  I know right now I'm looking like the Angry Black Man ¬© and that's cool, but it's annoying that regardless of what subreddit I'm in or what the conversation may be, seeing more psuedo-progressive bullshit guised as a matter-of-fact social reality just gets tiresome. Not because in this one instant it's a big deal, but maybe somebody reads this then the conversation comes up and he repeats it, or 20 years down the line some analogous situation presents itself and he tells his kid this shit. Not for one second would him or any of the 60-odd people who upvoted him consider that maybe the majority *have no interest whatsoever* in involving themselves in the community, but no, ""if they were affluent like myself there is no possible way they'd be underrepresented in this community so there must be some kind of socioeconomic cause at work"". It's the same justifications myself, my Hispanic friends, my Indian friends, etc hear a lot in conversations about race; Whites and East Asians are just really better situated for x, y, and z.  Yes, I might have overreacted, but damn. I'm not a combative person but it's something that offended me personally that I wouldn't expect to find in a thread about the noise level at MLG.   Edit: Sorry about this rambling, stream of conscious wall of text. It's 7 am and I haven't slept, my apologies. But, yes, as someone who has played Starcraft for ~12ish years and had many long ass conversations about it with black game geeks, it's a nerd hobby, and you have to be pretty secure (or cool or lacking self-awareness or whatever the case may be) to enjoy the community around it.",¬©

Klyosov, Igor L. Rozhanskii KEYWORDS Y Chromosome; Mutations; Haplotypes; Haplogroups; TMRCA; STR; SNP; ‚ÄúOut of Africa‚Äù ABSTRACT Seven thousand five hundred fifty-six (7556) haplotypes of 46 subclades in 17 major haplogroups were considered in terms of their base (ancestral) haplotypes and timespans to their common ancestors, for the purposes of designing of time-balanced haplogroup tree. It was found that African haplogroup A (originated 132,000 ¬± 12,000 years before present) is very remote time-wise from all other haplogroups, which have a separate common ancestor, named Œ≤-haplogroup, and originated 64,000 ¬± 6000 ybp. It includes a family of Europeoid (Caucasoid) haplogroups from F through T that originated 58,000 ¬± 5000 ybp. A downstream common ancestor for haplogroup A and Œ≤-haplogroup, coined the Œ±-haplogroup emerged 160,000 ¬± 12,000 ybp. A territorial origin of haplogroups Œ±- and Œ≤-remains unknown; however, the most likely origin for each of them is a vast triangle stretched from Central Europe in the west through the Russian Plain to the east and to Levant to the south. Haplogroup B is descended from Œ≤-haplogroup (and not from haplogroup A, from which it is very distant, and separated by as much as 123,000 years of ‚Äúlat- eral‚Äù mutational evolution) likely migrated to Africa after 46,000 ybp. The finding that the Europeoid haplogroups did not descend from ‚ÄúAfrican‚Äù haplogroups A or B is supported by the fact that bearers of the Europeoid haplogroups, as well as all non-African haplogroups do not carry either SNPs M91, P97, M31, P82, M23, M114, P262, M32, M59, P289, P291, P102, M13, M171, M118 (haplogroup A and its subclades SNPs) or M60, M181, P90 (haplogroup B), as it was shown recently in ‚ÄúWalk through Y‚Äù FTDNA Project (the reference is incorporated therein) on several hundred people from various haplogroups.

t5_2qore,Sp4z3n3ko,1339414886,"Good day people wandering the forums,  As by now is well known ( I think ), if you get ""error 8x"" you have a key limited to a specific language, and you are using a client from another language.  Alot of people on the this forum, and other forums think this is because people tried to get a very cheap RU key, just because they are cheapa*ses. The fact of the matter remains that alot of other people are affected aswell. Not everyone was out to buy a cheap key, alot of people abroad just bought a physical copy to have the dvd-rom on their shelf. Alot of people were unable to buy the game as Blizzard did not supply enough dvds or keys for the EU languages, so people opted to find another key digital. As the price of a physical copy in for example the Netherlands is only ‚Ç¨ 45,95 from a Blizzard controlled retailer, they will not buy the game for ‚Ç¨ 59,99 from the Blizzard store. Pls also note that the physical copy and the digital copy in Brazil, and Mexico for example have the same price , but still people are getting error 8x. Why only because they have the game key of a physical box!!   a guy from Brazil:  [quote]WOW... I Love Blizzard I called to the Support in Brazil and I heared a nice thing:  THE GAME BOUGHT IN PHYSICAL STORES CAN ONLY USE THE NATIVE LANGUAGE. THERE'S NO WAY TO DOWNLOAD THE OTHER LANGUAGES AND USES IT!  now, Blizzard, I don't want to play as a Arcanista ou Ca√ßador de Dem√¥nios ¬¨¬¨[/quote]  a guy from mexico:  [quote]blizz.. why does the latinamerican version (and others) have limitation... we paid the same price as the digital so... is our money worthless?? do we have to play on spanish because you asume we can't speak other laguages?? if it is... that's pure racism...  another thing... you were the ones that chose to sell the ""limited"" version in south america... absolutely NO difference with the ""complete""... you said that we should check the box.. but all it says is "" Diablo III Authentication key, Standard Edition - MX"" WHERE DOES IT SAYS IT'S LIMITED!!! 3 gust pass came within the box... everyone of them says ""guest pass"" so now i ask... why did you unilaterally left us out of language selection?? the game still has the option to change the language, we can download everything... so why??[/quote]  So people set ou to search the internet for keys ( if you just google diablo 3 cd-key you will get alot of response ). As prices were ranging from ‚Ç¨ 30 - ‚Ç¨ 59, they thought to their selfs ""let's buy a cheap key as all keys should be the same"". You would have done the same thing, especialy if you didn't have a lot of money. Alot of people even bought keys for the FULL amount of money as they believed "" If i pay full i will have a good key "" as they are ( or were ) Blizzard fan boys ( like I was ).  Blizzards Only response to our cries, were see the FAQ, or you need to buy a new key.  I hope this clears up some things for people as i have been following this almost from the start.

t5_2qh61,graffiti81,1339418800,"In the literature that comes with the shoes it says something to the effect of ""If your normal run is ten miles, start doing half a mile in VFFs and then the rest in normal shoes. Increase the distance each time.""  Basically your ankles and feet need time to strengthen muscles they have never really used because you have padded shoes.   Personally, I don't run in mine, I lift in them (and they also make great water shoes), because they force support muscles to become stronger.  I have a friend who was a marathon runner back when VFFs first came out. He didn't heed the warning and ran twenty miles in them and ended up not being able to walk for over a week. He's kind of a moron.   EDIT: From their website:  &gt;- Listen to your feet! Switching to Vibram FiveFingers¬Æ from traditional shoes is a transition that may take time. For some, it is a matter of weeks, for others months, and for a few it could be a year or more. Much is dependent on your foot type, the activities you‚Äôre using FiveFingers for, and the amount of pronation you experience. The progression will ultimately be worth the wait, and your foot and body will be stronger and better off for it. The answer lies in your inherent foot and body biomechanics and the condition of your muscles. Just remember, improving the skill of those muscles then practicing and using those muscles in Vibram FiveFingers¬Æ will increase both endurance and strength. This will have profound beneficial effects on your body and wellbeing. Listen to your body.  &gt;- Stop if your arches or the top of your foot is hurting, or if anything else hurts! Remember to transition slowly to FiveFingers in order to build strength in your lower legs and feet and to minimize discomfort. An adjustment period is normal, and any discomfort should decrease after a week or two of use. When running in FiveFingers, sometimes arch and foot pain occurs from landing with your feet too far forward relative to your hips and having to point your toes too much. It can also occur from landing with too rigid a foot and not letting your heel drop gently.  &gt;- Stop and let your body heal if you experience pain. Sore, tired muscles are normal; bone, joint, or soft-tissue pain is a signal of injury.  &gt;- In the beginning, remember to carry your traditional footwear in your hands as a backup. If you need to stop in the middle of a workout, you can put on your cushioned running shoes and continue with your activity.",¬Æ

t5_2qhkh,Billism,1339444966,"Hey neighbor. There are 6 Sumter cucumber plants and 6 Marketmore 76 plants on the other side. So far, there are many more Sumters fruiting.  My soil and fertilization got off to a bad start. I started with a ""premium garden mix"" soil bought locally at [Champion Landscape](http://www.houstonlandscapemulch.com/). They accidentally put a bunch of un-decomposed wood chips in the soil mixture, which was robbing the soil of nitrogen as it decomposed, so almost nothing I planted was growing in this mix. The owner of Champion Landscape gave me a 40 lbs bag of Ag-LIFE¬Æ 2-4-2 (Great stuff! [Info here](http://rhizogen.com/pro/?page_id=125)) which helped reverse the effects of the decomposing wood and helped root growth. Now, the garden is blowing up. i did add a ring of 13-13-13 fertilizer around all the plants last month, too.  This is my first time growing summer squash. The first 3 (bought transplants from Home Depot) I had were totally destroyed by green caterpillars. I think the eggs must have been on the transplants because I haven't seen those caterpillars before or after the squash was decimated. I then planted some more by seed, and that is what you see growing. It looks like 2 will be ready to pick tomorrow. So far, nothing has bothered these squash plants.",¬Æ

I performed a store-bought soil test kit and saw my soil mix was mostly deficient in K and P and totally deficient in N.

I eventually would like to be back at the 38 waist I had at the start of high school.  I'm basically doing this for the Wal-mart jeans and not getting another job. If I had to quantify it, I'd say...200-220lbs over the next 3 years.  **Making a plan** I currently have a membership to the local rec center, where I swim 5-6 days a week for anywhere between 30mins to 2 hours a day, depending on my schedule. I also have added weight training four days a week and am looking at adding the The Couch-to-5K ¬Æ Running Plan once I lose a little more weight. As far as diet goes, I plan to keep my caloric intake between 1200-1500 per day until my workout regiment demands more calories to sustain itself. Also, I receive about $75-100 in free booze and bar food a week. I'm trading in nachos for chicken salads (with just chicken and lettuce) and drinking 8-10 whiskey/vodka/rum/gins plus high calorie mixer for 2 a night with club soda. I also cancelled my subscription to TOR and signed up for Fitocracy (user: jbrake).  **Introduction** Hey everyone, name's Jesse. I'm a trivia writer and quizmaster for Geeks Who Drink.com. I host pub quizzes and get paid to create content, blog, and drink while attempting to be funny/edgy/sober.

I'm doing this because ~~as a 440lb man, I have not had as much sex with shallow women as I would like. Emotionally, not vaginally. That's uncomfortable- and also, you were probably a man at one point. Whatever, post-ops need love too~~ I'm 26 and don't want to deal with being old and overweight.

The server you are looking at will run at roughly 460 watts idle and easily 500 at peak.  Upsides are more drives and an actual raid card.   I would try to aim at the Core 2 Duo/Quad gen of xeons if you insist on finding an older server. While these are still far behind modern processors in speed, they at least have better power management and are a fair bit more efficient.   Also never use the redundant power supply at home unless it is absolutely needed, the extra power supply will add 20-30% to your operating (electricity) costs. ",¬Æ

They are fundamentally re-thinking gender and opening up space for fuller and richer lives for those who don‚Äôt fit easily within the gender binary (and really, for everyone).   &gt;That said, we always need to be looking forward, making more space, thinking further outside the box.

t5_2qm4e,faul_sname,1339724943,"&gt;How is information = energy? You brought it up, so I'm curious now.  Ok, now we'll get into Maxwell's demon.  Return to the horrible ascii art, but now let's put a demon who only lets particles go left in the middle.       /‚Äæ‚Äæ‚Äæ‚Äæ‚Äæ\   /‚Äæ‚Äæ‚Äæ‚Äæ‚Äæ\     |  o o  -‚ôÄ-      |     |       -&lt;-  o o  |  6 states      \_____/   \_____/       /‚Äæ‚Äæ‚Äæ‚Äæ‚Äæ\   /‚Äæ‚Äæ‚Äæ‚Äæ‚Äæ\     |  o o  -‚ôÄ-      |     |  o    -&lt;-    o  | 4 states      \_____/   \_____/       /‚Äæ‚Äæ‚Äæ‚Äæ‚Äæ\   /‚Äæ‚Äæ‚Äæ‚Äæ‚Äæ\     |  o o  -‚ôÄ-      |     |  o o  -&lt;-       | 1 state      \_____/   \_____/  So the demon just moved it to a lower-entropy state by blocking particles from going right (which doesn't take energy) and allowing particles to go left (which also doesn't take energy). Then we can extract energy from this system by allowing the particles to expand back into the space on the right (more particles on the left means a pressure differential). So unless information costs energy, you could get infinite energy out of any system.   As it turns out, information/ reduced entropy does cost energy, specifically according to this equation:      E = kT ln(n)  where n is the number of states you eliminate as possibilities.",‚ôÄ

Of course the adults were there, my aunt and the man and woman that owned the pool, seeing as we were way too little to swim by ourselves.  Well, I was sitting on one of the inflatable pool chair-raft thingies feeling pretty fucking awesome that I got up there by myself when the guy comes and playfully flips me off of it.  I didn't really know how to swim at that point so I sunk like a rock and took in a lot of water on the way down.  I can only remember tiny bits and pieces of what happened next.  I sort of remember being at the bottom of the pool for a moment and then the next thing I know I'm waking up on the ground beside the pool with him looking over me.

I used to have this subreddit bookmarked by comments and usually about half the new comments were from EPS regulars or other people who aren't really interested in talking about Ron Paul's policies and are just here to stir things up. It's the same people all the time too. Many have like 20,000+ karma. It's like dealing with spam and it's almost to the point of not being worthwhile.   Obviously they have control of the comments here too because I see the same people getting upvotes as the people that are Ron Paul supporters that are here to talk and/or read about policies and strategies get downvotes. Typical day at /r/ronpaul.  I do think though that other than the distractions the subreddit itself has a lot of positive things going on. I see people that are really educated about what is going on in this country and people that care enough to be involved in some way to improve things. I know that there is a lot of disagreement going on with the Rand, Ron, Gary thing, but I hope that individuals do not get too caught up in all of this because **those are just people and our messages are greater than any single one of them.**  No matter where any of us stand as far as which politician we favor, I think all the liberty-minded individuals here have a great deal to contribute to the world and need to be heard. Even if you are disillusioned with the Ron Paul subreddit I hope you don't become disillusioned with the idea that we can make big chances because we can and I look forward to seeing where we go from here.   ‚ô•",‚ô•

He doesn't have a life to live now, but if he could, he'd live it up. So YOU have to now. Carry it on and do something better with his name than he did with it. Honour it, cherish it, love it and do him good.  It's gonna be hard. It's gonna be freakin' hard, but it's possible to get through it.

I will quote the paper's own conclusion of that section to clarify it:  I don't think I misunderstood what that section was about. It was showing that the SES-SAT relationship changes depending on whether you look at students in college or all students who took the test, and provided some speculation as to why this might be. The authors then conclude that the population you are looking at when quoting the SES-SAT correlation should be specified.

t5_2ssmu,olympic_lifter,1340217902,"In general any radical diet plan needs to be looked at with a skeptical eye, especially one that is [branded and approached like a business](http://carbbackloading.com/).  I have no idea whether this is particularly effective and/or safe, but I get a bit leery when the creator of the diet makes claims like this (from OP's first article): ""Carb timing‚Äîor mistiming‚Äîmay be the most common cause of a crappy workout and missed lifts."" I can tell you immediately that's total garbage, and that some of the most common causes of crappy workouts are lack of sleep and overtraining.  More from that article: ""Back-loading carbs runs against every dietary recommendation to guarantee a solid, strong workout. The body needs carbs to lift heavy, or so the advice goes.""  This actually isn't entirely true, as there are plenty of studies on NIH's PubMed that point to the usefulness of protein prior to a workout. Carb-loading recommendations are generally for endurance training. Not to mention that, even if Kiefer is correct, it would be even more suspect to suggest a diet that current nutritional evidence contraindicates.  I'm not saying this is a bad idea, as I haven't done the research or heard analysis from any independent experts. It might well provide tips that can help an individual improve their diet. Honestly, just eating clean and getting enough protein will be far more effective than any such diet plan.  PS: Here's what [WebMD has to say about spotting fad diets](http://women.webmd.com/fad-diets):  * Recommendations that promise a quick fix. (""The Carb Nite¬Æ Solution is an advanced diet plan designed to strip body fat safely, rapidly and permanently."") * Dire warnings of dangers from a single product or regimen. (""Unfortunately, diet pills and typical diet programs don‚Äôt work when you need to lose those last few pounds."") * Claims that sound too good to be true. (""The Carb Nite¬Æ Solution targets fat cells and is the only diet that creates the magic combination of hormone levels that can actually kill fat cells."") * Simplistic conclusions drawn from a complex study. (""A recent study in the New England Journal of Medicine revealed that even a few extra pounds can increase your risk of death. ... So even if you carry just ten extra pounds, you‚Äôre taking an unnecessary risk."") * Recommendations based on a single study or testimonials. (""This is the most amazing diet I've ever tried. Never before would I have believed I could eat donuts and cheesecake to lose the unwanted pounds. - Meredith, Iowa"") * Dramatic statements that are refuted by reputable scientific organizations. (""The Carb Nite¬Æ Solution ... can actually kill fat cells."") * Lists of 'good' and 'bad' foods. (Not sure if the ""over three hundred pages of food lists"" is good vs bad foods, since I'm not buying the book) * Recommendations made to help sell a product. ([Buy the book!](http://carbnite.com/ns-buythebook.php)) * Recommendations based on studies published without review by other researchers. (I don't know all the studies he's referring to) * Recommendations from studies that ignore differences among individuals or groups. (I don't know all the studies he's referring to) * Eliminating 1 or more of the 5 food groups. (""Cut carbs back to 30 grams or less everyday for ten days."")  All quotes taken from the creator's [website](http://carbnite.com/index.php).

You're right. I was looking at his quotes about fasted training being preferable to unfasted training, and I seem to have gotten confused.  EDIT: I didn't get confused, I was just too ambiguous. I was responding to the claim that, ""The body needs carbs to lift heavy, or so the advice goes,"" because that itself was the strawman. The general advice is to eat carbs for endurance, not weightlifting.  &gt; *""Honestly, just eating clean and getting enough protein will be far more effective than any such diet plan.""* That's a huge claim, and entirely conjecture.  It's only conjecture because I didn't cite sources; they're easy to find. Are you really implying that binging on cheesecake and cherry turnovers in the evening is more effective than eating clean just because you didn't eat carbs in the morning? Because that's a HUGE claim, and it's a hallmark of a fad diet.  &gt; Kiefer markets his diet plan like a lot of internet marketers, but all of the claims you've picked up on are fully referenced in his books.  You're right, I'm not about to spend $89 to convince you that I've followed all his references. Kiefer already made magical claims about his diets, such as ""The Carb Nite¬Æ Solution ... can actually kill fat cells,"" even though I can point you right to [well-respected research](http://www.nih.gov/researchmatters/may2008/05122008fat.htm) that says this doesn't happen. There's a refutation - I believe the burden of proof for such a radical claim lies with the claimant, so can you show me the sources that support this?  &gt; So you haven't actually tried the diet? Nor read his books, used it with clients, compared to other diets, etc.?  No kidding, I'm not going to try every new diet that comes down the pike, nor read their books, nor experiment on people, nor spend hours researching them. There are far too many, and when they present like this one they always fall far short. I have a limited amount of time in my life to compete, and I'm not going to waste it by trying every get-better-quick product.  While we're getting all *ad hominem* here, I'll also point out that you came into this as a clearly biased supporter of the diet, and your tone is more of someone discouraging a discussion than adding constructively to one.

t5_2rnve,live_free,1340266213,"You are looking at i7 processors. Which means you want HT (Hyper Threading). Here is the thing, unless you edit video, encode video, program, or the like, you will only need an i5.  I would go with a used i5 2500k that is a proven overclocker. You can get good used chips and great forum support at [this site](http://www.overclock.net/).   That will run you about 170 or so, throw in a decent mobo for 150-200 and you got more than you will ever need. Due to the money you just saved pick yourself up an awesome cooler, something like the Silver Arrow, Noctua NH-D14, or a H100.   I recommend www.newegg.com for all your purchases.  In regards to your comments.  &gt;I see the 3770k Memory Type is DDR3-1333/1600 --Does this mean 1600MHz RAM is the fastest that will work?  They will all run 1600mhz just fine.   &gt;Intel¬Æ HD Graphics 4000 --Does this even matter if I get an aftermarket card?  There are some chipsets that support using both on-board and dedicated cards, but they are not worth it and yield little results.   &gt;PCI Express Revision 3.0 -- This means the IVY Bridge CPU can take advantage of PCIe 3.0 and the others can't?  Yes it does. But it doesn't matter. No card can max out PCI Express 2.0 at x16. 3.0 doubles the bandwidth of each lane making x16 effectively x32. This does nothing for gaming, and little for anything else. By little I mean not noticeable.  &gt;Tcase: 67.4¬∞C 3770k vs 72.6¬∞C 2600/2700k -- I read about TCase and TJMax and TJunction, but I'm still lost; can someone throw me a bone here?  Temps on the SB processors is lower because they used fluxless solder. In essence you can overclock a SB processor higher than a IB processor due to the lower temps. But clock for clock an IB processor beats it.    TL;DR  You are worrying about nothing.  Get a i5 2500k or i5 3570k, a Silver Arrow, Noctua NH-D14, or H100, and call it a day.

t5_2s7tt,dusdus,1340306687,"Let's point out the premises of your argument, and show why they're false.  (1) There's no applicability to descriptivism to the outside world.  This isn't true. Every other country in the world does teach a standard language. It's necessary for teaching reading and writing. People get along just fine speaking the standard as well as their native linguistic varieties. It's an issue about contextualizing things appropriately, and not working within a framework in which there is value judgements associated with particular speaking patterns.  (2) The motivation for this way of thinking is political correctness.  No. The motivation for it is *precedence* and *scientific thinking*. We know *for a fact* that teaching within a descriptivist framework radically improves test scores in the relevant areas and actually results in an ironing out in educational inequalities. Furthermore, any objective thinking about language can't be prescriptivist, which is inherently subjective.  (3) The point of rules is to avoid muddling of meaning.  Again, not true. Linguists acknowledge that language is rule-governed. This is obviously true, and if it weren't true, we wouldn't have a job (you can't do science with something that isn't internally consistent!). But those rules that actually govern peoples' knowledge of language has nothing to do with what you learn in schools. But we also know for a fact that the majority of these rules are learned by the age of 3, and experimentation with children and babies show that language is to a large extent mastered well before then, some even claiming that sound systems are learned in utero. So, we know language is rule based and a well suited medium for expressing meaning, but *those rules* you learn in school are completely irrelevant.  (4) Descriptivism entails throwing out all the rules  No, it entails recognizing that they're arbitrary aspects of a particular variety of the language that has been elevated to the ""standard"" variety. It entails understanding that there isn't One Correct Version of English¬Æ and that people who grew up speaking different versions (for instance, people in rural areas, blacks, and hispanics) are NOT acting out of ignorance, but are just speaking a distinct variety in different settings. It might seem subtle, but the facts are on the table that, again, in educational settings, this has a huge impact.  (5) We won't be able to communicate with anyone outside a 5-mile radius if we maintain a positive attitude to non-standard forms.  Again, precedent shows this is just an absurd conclusion. Have you ever heard of people not being able to understand each other in Spain? How about India? India literally has *hundreds* of distinct, mutually unintelligible languages, but they have a standard variety (Castilian Spanish in Spain, Hindi and English in India) that aids communication across groups. Descriptivism does not entail abolishing a standard variety.  (6) English would become fractured.  It's becoming fractured as it is. Studies addressing whether or how telecommunication and the internet would slow or alter linguistic evolution came to a surprising conclusion. It was hypothesized that since telephones and the internet meant we would be talking with people outside of our local area much more frequently, dialects would begin to converge and we'd see significantly less interlinguistic variation. We found the opposite. We don't know why, but we know for a fact that English -- and other languages around the globe -- are actually diverging and evolving pretty swiftly. A standard explanation is citing what I mentioned before -- language is essentially learned in entirety before age 3, well before kids go to school let alone chat on reddit -- and increasing social stratification.",¬Æ

t5_2qzbh,diglyd,1340362533,"A few helpful suggestions....  1st rule of having a web design business is:  Ensure that your own website is perfect and free of grammatical, UI, or design errors or inconsistencies no matter how trivial as it is a reflection of the quality of your work.   here is a little example...  under your ""our services page"" where it says website with 3 pages.  it says ""gome"" instead of home.   Under why choose us section, some of your fonts are different colors for no apparent reason.   Your portfolio: Drew's Garage: (1st image in your auto rotator)     This is their website...http://www.drewsgarageonline.com/ so either link to it or make sure a client can't get there because if you don't link your past clients your potential clients will try to find them and contact them to figure out if you are worth the time and $$$$.   So after going to Drew's garage I noticed that it is made by...ready..TAT TAT TA TA: ¬©2011 Drew's Garage Website Design and Maintained by Spark Your Ideas, LLC. Programming and Phoenix SEO by Brian Webb  The website of the developer who build this site is: http://www.sparkyourideas.com/     That obviously is not you guys so its either someone on your team who worked on this site under another company at which point you have no right to claim the credit as all assets belong to said company regardless of the individual who designed it if he worked for them at the time, or I call bullshit and you just ripped off someone else's work.      Either way regardless of what the truth is...if I am a potential client looking for a site developer you just got eliminated for not being honest or having a portfolio that links to someone else's work.  (at least from my point of view after looking at the actual client sites). You guys need to ensure things match up and the trail leads back to you.   I am a business owner and when I see something like this I close your site and say ""amateurs"" or ""this is bullshit""...and leave and tell others not to go there.   I didn't bother looking for the other ones...  You only get 1 (ONE) shot to make the RIGHT first impression.    -Some additional comments:     Under the section WHY CHOOSE EXPONENTIAL WEB MARKETING? you state that many other firms take 2 to 6 months to design a site. This is clearly not true and only applies to complex sties, storefronts, or custom frameworks, and or lots of back end customization or web services integration or custom reporting. Since you do not advertise that you perform custom framework development or e-com integration or serious enterprise development i would expect you to be able to produce a basic site relatively quickly. 99% of other web businesses have the same turn around as you do and most people these days know it does not take that long to build a site. So what makes you better?     Speaking of which, what are your client websites build on? Do you use templates or custom work? Do you use wordpress or joomla or octopress or what? Do you provide windows sites or linux based sites? Is there a mobile version of the site included? if no why not? Are the sites HTML5 and ipad compatible? Do you do custom graphics? What SEO services do you provide? What if I already have a domain name and don't need a free one do I get a discount? What if I need an adult business site done? Do you guys provide those services too?      You claim the websites are ""always expendable"" how? what does this mean? As a client can I expand them myself? Do you build them to be expandable so that I can do it or that you can do it? Does that mean that because they are always expandable next time I call you for some additional work you won't charge me as much since the site is already designed to be expandable?      Since your first year of hosting is free do you provide the support also for free for the first year? What type of hosting is it? is it shared, is it a private server? is it on the cloud? What are the costs afterwards?    -You also mention how you streamlined your process and you claim that after an hour you will have enough information to proceed and won't contact me again until the site is done. This alone give me the following impression:  1. how can you know only after an hour what my business is all about in addition to going over in detail about your services and pricing and answering my questions all at the same time? (that is a very arrogant assumption on your part).   2. Why would you not work with me on this or give me some sort of phased review process?  3. You are full of shit because there is no way you can know enough about my true ""need"" in an hour.       So lets say for example my business has a shielded anechoic chamber facility and we do EMI testing services and I need a site that shows the various services we provide.      So you are saying that in the span of 1 hour you will know enough about my business to whip out the entire site? What about the content? Do I as a customer have to send you the copy within an hour? How will you know what goes on my services page? I don't have anything written down I'm a business owner.  (See where I am going with this?....its not a good thing to say that all you will need will be an hour. It does not give me a warm fuzzy.)     What about images? What if I need to have images created and put on the site? I can't use stock images. How does that work? For example as a client I might want to have professional images done of my test facilities and I don't have any equipment or staff to do this? How are you handling this since you state that after the first hour you won't communicate with me again until the site is done for me to review?   Speaking of images how many images do I get with each page? What about video?      What if I have allot of video? If the first year of hosting is ""free"" do you cover the bandwidth costsfor streaming media during that year? What if my site gets ""fireballed"" from Reddit and I get 5,000-50,000+ visitors all at once because someone links to an article I posted on the blog from the /r Science subredit. Do you cover the costs of this bandwidth increase/spike since hosting is free for the first year? Will the site stay up? Do you guarantee this? if my site goes down do you cover the downtime costs? (see where I am going with this? There are other factors to consider if you put certain info on your site or make certain claims about anything being ""free"").      Why do I only get 1 personalized link? is that like a special link just for me? What about a contact us link so people can send email? is that not included? What about a join our mailing list link? Is that special or part of the package? What about if I need someone to fill out a form or sign up for a newsletter? Is that part of the deal?   When you finish the site a week or 3 days later (depending on the package I choose) if I review the site and don't like it then what happens? Do you spend another week redesigning? I thought you would not bother me and let me focus on running my business according to your site. Do you start over or give me a refund? How is this review process going to be facilitated? How many changes do I get to make per page? How many times total?     What if you can't meet your deadline of 1 week or 1 month while building my site? What recourse do I have since you failed in your verbal contract as stated on your site? Do I get a refund? Do you offer a money back guarantee?   What about my white papers, materials, test results or other info I might want to put on the site? If I give them to you within that hour are you going to know what to do with them?  Also who is your team and where are your offices if you are Arizona local?   -As a business owner I want to know that you exist. What is your team composed of and what is their background? Add a about us page and list each team member with an image and their background or resume.      You state ""Every team member at Exponential Web Marketing is a local Arizona resident. Having done years of freelancing and work with other major firms in Arizona, we have chosen to come together to create a smaller company to provide businesses like yours with incredible results.""     What other major firms have you worked with? What ""incredible results"" are you referring to specifically? Where are the references and/or links to these major companies that you worked with on your site? What did the work consist of and where are the examples? Provide references to individuals at these companies who can vouch for these claims or don't say bullshit like this or someone will call you out on it.      you probably want to say came together as a strong team or formed a team of talented individuals instead of saying ""smaller company"". It almost sounds like you were part of something bigger it did not work out and you formed a smaller one. Why would that make me want to work with you?     If I want to schedule my 15 minute consultation what phone number can I reach you at? If I want to speak to one of these super talented and exceptional individuals so I can get some answers who do I call and what is the number?   See what I am getting at....your site does not leave me with that warm fuzzy feeling.      Its missing the most basic things that make me ""the customer"" comfortable that you are professional and that my money will be well spent.   Be careful what you say. Make sure that you can back up anything that you say. If you can't back it up don't put it on there. Don't just write some bullshit how you worked with all these clients and companies and how great you are without providing proof.   -Fix that shit and good luck. I'm just trying to help you out by giving you a no BS impression of your site after viewing it as I am a customer who was looking for someone to build me a site and I have been looking at allot of web dev sites lately.   -There is no such thing as an ""in progress site"". if you are starting a business and especially if you are in the web design business and you put up a site it better be ready to go. This isn't a community site you are building . This is a reflection of the service you provide. It should be the best it can be. If its not then you are not ready to do business. (and keep in mind that I didn't even bother to inspect any code elements of your site to see if you used a template or built the site yourself or to see what its running on to determine its ""form"" and code ""cleanliness"" and adherence to standards. Some might do this like a mechanic buddy going along with you to check out a used car).  This might sound harsh, but business IS harsh. be prepared to answer all these questions listed above or have them answered on your site in one form or another because business owners will ask you these type of questions, scrutinize what you say, and use what you say against you to not pay you. If you want people to part with their hard earned dollars you better impress them, and the best way to impress is with transparency and honesty if you are small.   * edit for grammar and lots of bad spelling, and minor contextual corrections/additions.

t5_2qh2v,halfprice06,1340377433,"Washington Post Reporter Finds Holes in China's Tiananmen Immolation Story  (Philip P. Pan    2/6/01 11:17)  KAIFENG, China (Washington Post Foreign Service) -- There is a neighborhood on the eastern side of this once-glorious city called Apple Orchard, but there are no apple trees here, only drab concrete buildings and clusters of unemployed men loitering on mud streets. It was here, in a fourth-floor apartment in Building Six, that Liu Chunling and her 12-year-old daughter, Liu Siying, lived.  The mother was a quiet woman who kept to herself, the daughter a lively fifth-grader who never failed to smile and say hello. Neighbors recalled there was something both strange and sad about Liu Chunling, that she sometimes hit her child, that she drove her elderly mother away, that she worked in a nightclub and took money to keep men company.  But no one suspected that Liu, 36, might have joined the banned spiritual movement Falun Gong. And hardly anyone noticed when she and her daughter disappeared.  And then, there they were on national television, their bodies engulfed in orange flames in Tiananmen Square. Liu Siying was shown lying on a stretcher, her face and lips charred black, whimpering, ""Mama, mama."" Her mother, the newscast reported, was already dead.  What drove the Lius and three others from this city in central Henan province, about 350 miles south of Beijing, to pour gasoline on their bodies and set themselves afire on Jan. 23, the eve of the Chinese New Year?  An intense battle is underway to answer that question, with the five individuals cast in turn as victims of an evil cult, righteous protesters against a repressive government or desperately estranged people on the margins of a fast-changing society.  The ruling Communist Party has launched an all-out campaign to use the incident to prove its claim that Falun Gong is a dangerous cult, and to turn public opinion in China and abroad against the group it outlawed 18 months ago and has tried to crush, at times with brutal tactics.  Every morning and night, the state-controlled media carry fresh attacks against Falun Gong and its U.S.-based leader, Li Hongzhi. Schools have been ordered to ""educate"" pupils about the sect. Discussion meetings have been organized in factories, offices and universities. Religious leaders as far away as Tibet have delivered scripted denunciations. In Kaifeng, the post office issued an anti-Falun Gong postmark, and 10,000 people signed a public petition against the group.  China has also used the incident to pressure Hong Kong to ban Falun Gong, testing the strength of the ""one country, two systems"" setup that gives the former British colony autonomy over its affairs. Falun Gong exists legally in Hong Kong, but the territory's security chief warned Thursday that police intend to monitor the group's activities closely.  Falun Gong leaders insist that the Lius and their companions could not have been members of their movement, which promotes a mix of Buddhism, Taoism and traditional Chinese breathing exercises. They have said Falun Gong clearly forbids both violence and suicide and have suggested the government may have staged the incident.  Other human rights activists say the five set themselves on fire to protest the government's crackdown on Falun Gong, which has resulted in thousands of arrests and as many as 105 deaths in police custody. All but 12-year-old Liu Siying had protested Beijing's actions against Falun Gong in Tiananmen Square previously, according to the Hong Kong-based Information Center for Human Rights and Democracy.  There is a tradition of politically motivated suicide in China. At the start of China's last dynasty, in the 1640s, hundreds of people killed themselves rather than live under the conquering Manchus. More than 250 years later, several students committed suicide to protest the Qing Dynasty's refusal to establish a constitutional republic. Most recently, countless Chinese took their lives to escape the abuse of Mao Zedong's Cultural Revolution.  But there is hardly any precedent for public self-immolation. In Kaifeng, a city of 700,000 that was China's imperial capital and one of the world's most populous cities at the turn of the last millennium, most residents took a dim view of what Liu and the others did.  ""They disgraced Kaifeng, and they disgraced China in front of the whole world. It was just too much!"" said Tang Shaohua, 60, who runs a grocery around the corner from Liu's home.  ""It's so sad what happened to that little girl. I used to see her playing around here,"" added neighbor Zhang Binglian, 60. ""Falun Gong is an evil cult. I thought that before, and I'm even more convinced now.""  But even in Kaifeng, there are signs that the government's propaganda campaigns have lost some of their effectiveness. Several residents expressed weariness with the barrage against Falun Gong.  ""I'm not saying I don't believe the government, but I'm not saying I believe it, either,"" said Liu Xiaoyu, 39, as she made dumplings in Kaifeng's lively night market. ""The government controls the news. We all know that now.""  Cab driver Wang Chaohui said he believed Falun Gong was a religion like any other, and said it would be unfair to blame the acts of five individuals on a group with millions of practitioners. In any case, he said, the crackdown on Falun Gong was sure to backfire.  ""China is different now, and they can't arrest everybody who believes in something like this,"" he said. ""It only makes things worse.""  Wang said the real question China must confront is why so many people believe in something like Falun Gong. ""People are dissatisfied with society,"" he said. ""That's the problem.""  Like the rest of China, Kaifeng has experienced a revival in all kinds of religions as communist ideology has lost its appeal. Over the past decade, residents have turned in large numbers to Christianity, Buddhism, Taoism -- and Falun Gong. Before the group was banned, hundreds practiced its meditation exercises in the city's parks.  Falun Gong has attracted a cross section of Chinese -- party members, senior army officers, bureaucrats, teachers and millions living on the margins of society. In Kaifeng, where several factories have closed and the economy has slumped, many are searching for something to believe in.  The state media have said little about why the five who set themselves on fire might have joined Falun Gong. Beijing denied requests to interview Liu Siying and the three other survivors, who are all hospitalized with serious burns. A Kaifeng official said only China Central Television and the official New China News Agency were permitted to speak to their relatives or their colleagues. A man who answered the door at the Liu home referred questions to the government.  But Liu Chunling's Apple Orchard neighbors described her as a woman who led a troubled life and suffered from psychological problems. State media identified 78-year-old Hao Xiuzhen as her adoptive mother. Neighbors said they quarreled often before Liu drove the woman from their home last year.  ""There was something wrong with her,"" said neighbor Liu Min, 51. ""She hit her mother, and her mother was crying and yelling. She hit her daughter, too.""  There were also questions about how Liu supported herself and about the whereabouts of her daughter's father. Neighbors said Liu was not a native of Kaifeng, and that a man in southern Guangdong province paid her rent. Others, including neighbor Wen Jian, 22, said Liu worked in a local nightclub and was paid to dine with and dance with customers.  None ever saw her practice Falun Gong.  ¬© 2001 The Washington Post (Philip P. Pan    2/6/01 11:17)",¬©

t5_2smzw,SomePostMan,1340386321,"My best (shitty) guess:  In replacement tricks like this, the special card is often pre-chosen.  1. The 7‚ô¶ was pre-chosen, just like he joked (""it's okay if I see the card... I've seen this trick before""). He palmed the 7‚ô¶ in on top of Deck #1 [2:38 ... his hands appear empty at least for a moment but the angle and cut is limiting], the one he opened and that Penn shuffled. (Note that he didn't ask Penn to pick a random card, but the one ""on the back"".)  2. He swapped decks when he took the pen out [2:49] (as Penn noticed). The ""cooler"" deck that he brought in was:   ¬∑ a shuffled deck with the joker, premiums, and 7‚ô¶ taken out, facing up;   ¬∑ with the bottom half of the deck (8‚ô¶ and up) slightly pushed out (~1/16"") to make that slot easy to access;   ¬∑ snugly in the box, with the bottom open, in the wrapper, with the bottom of the wrapper open;   ¬∑ with a bit of easy adhesive (e.g. post-it-note glue, which won't smear or dry but will stay put for a second);   ¬∑ with one custom-made extra-large card (~1/8"" wider, ~3/8"" longer) on top of it all to conceal the fact that the deck's in a box, sealed, and the bottom's hanging out.   (Note the angle of the deck toward the camera to maximize this effect.)  3. He finds the split in the deck and slides the signed 7‚ô¶ *face-down* into the deck at that spot (you can see him sliding it in carefully), then closes the bottom of the box and the wrapper behind it [3:00] while misdirecting with the Penn-pen joke and the sway of his body and laughing. Note his right thumb &amp; co. lingering near the bottom of the deck for a few seconds longer (camera angle limiting again).  4. He places the whole thing (sealed box with custom card on top) into Penn's hand, with his hand on top of the custom card, and has Penn cover it before removing the custom card.   &amp;nbsp;   (Sidenote:   ""Would it be impressive if I pulled out your card?"" This is to incorporate this seemingly-superfluous card into the act, so it doesn't seem so suspicious.   ""That would be very impressive."" Penn's just playing along and being nice. That trick alone would require only a slight palming of the card, and no deck switch.)   &amp;nbsp;   He claims the custom card he removed was the joker (and he probably made it a joker on the face side to be safe, although the camera contrast is too high to see) (of course, the cooler deck-box-wrapper never had a joker to begin with).  ‚Ä¢ Voila: Penn's holding a resealed deck containing 52 factory-ordered cards with his in the correct spot, but turned around. Shawn has him inspect the outside but not open it: there are no slits. He tears off the seal from the top. (It appears that he left the bottom of the seal on the deck, but again there's a camera cut. That might have been important or not depending on how he messed with the bottom.) The rest is automatic and he's very careful to turn the 7‚ô¶ around by the tips of his fingers so no one can suspect he simply palmed it in at the last moment.",‚ô¶

Instead, they responded with paragraph after paragraph defending the mug, saying how it's not homophobic because intent *is* magic after all, saying how **YOU'RE** the real homophobe if you think the mug's problematic, how art is SUPPOSED to be provocative and finally taking the mug out of the store (BUT NOT BECAUSE IT'S HOMOPHOBIC) but not really.  It's pretty common among SJWs that they're cool with calling out any problematic thing until something that they really, *really* like is called out.

t5_2r0gj,idioma,1340455551,"Pay the extortion, but pay close attention to your wife and her emotional state. Telling her how you feel about the LDS church is going to be worse in a lot of ways than death of a close family member. If you are sealed to her, it is going to be a massive blow to learn that you two won't be together forever since you're an apostate. She will feel betrayed by you and very confused since it sounds like you really do love her; I'm guessing that is mutual.  As for the Bishop: This is a good chance for you to learn to tell people ""no"". Don't say you'll pray about it. Don't be lukewarm in your approach either. Tell him that your wife is grieving right now and that your marriage is rightfully your top priority and that nothing could make you put the church before your own wife and family. I don‚Äôt know if your bishop is a good guy or not, mileage varies quite a bit in that department ‚Äì especially since they are unpaid and untrained non-professionals. The thing is, a good man in that position would fully accept you for having your priorities in order. Anything else means that this guy is a class-A prick and he doesn‚Äôt deserve anything from you. Fuck him.  This is where being good at saying ‚Äúno‚Äù comes in. The Bishop likely does have a few tricks in his bag; I‚Äôll go over a few of these:  - Threats of withdrawing the spirit or advising you that this is a ‚Äútest from god‚Äù or a ‚Äútest of your faith‚Äù.  These are irrelevant, you don‚Äôt believe in any of that hocus pocus, and even though he doesn‚Äôt know that, you can still use this factor to your advantage:  ‚ÄúI know you feel really good about calling me to do this, and I‚Äôm sure you are very disappointed to find out that I‚Äôm not available at this time; but I‚Äôm sure God wouldn‚Äôt give you a challenge that you couldn‚Äôt overcome. If The Lord has put me in this situation, it must be for a good reason, and may that reason is for someone with less teaching experience to receive a calling of this kind.‚Äù  You throw that spiritual-cash-and-prizes-super-challenge bullshit right back in his face.  - ‚ÄúI want you to go home and pray about this.‚Äù  Actually, as soon as you said that you wanted to see me, I had a very strong feeling that I needed to pray and when I did‚Ä¶(fill in the details here); when I was praying I kept thinking about how much I love my wife and how important she is to me. I kept trying to think about church, my sense of duty, service, responsibility, and my faith; but it kept being pushed away by my thoughts of Her. It was such a powerful experience, blah, blah, blah, I thought I‚Äôd be more conflicted but *The Spirit¬©* made it so clear to me ‚Äì My wife should be my top priority right now.  If he can‚Äôt accept that as a valid exemption then you simply say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, but this isn‚Äôt even about me, it is about Her. Nothing you could say would make me forget how much I love my wife. My mind is made up, you are going to need to find someone else for this calling.‚Äù",¬©

t5_2qh33,fAuxlRose,1340509713,"Text from this asshole my girlfriend found on the interweb:  I love girls. Unless of course, the girl lets it slip that she's under 18 years of age. In that case, I am legally obligated not to pump her full of my glorious semen. Also, I don't love fat chicks. Oh, or ugly chicks. But I absolutely love girls who are thin, pretty, and willing to lie to me about their age. I love everything about pretty girls: their curves, their hair, their smell, their warm inviting holes, even their skin. And when genetics or a highly skilled team of plastic surgeons give a girl a perfect body, I hate to see her desecrate it. Girls do all sorts of stupid shit to their bodies. And while fake tans and too many piercings piss me off just as much, this rant is dedicated to tattoos. Tattoos are a badass form of personal expression if you're some fat biker guy or some wannabe rockstar, but when you're a chick with killer tits, the last thing you should do is put a big ugly tattoo on those tits. I don't believe the female form should be tampered with at all, but there are five places in particular where a girl should NEVER get a tattoo:  1. Back of the neck There's only two tattoos that you can get on the back of your neck: a butterfly or a gay ass Japanese kanji symbol. Why the hell would you want a tattoo on the back of your neck anyway? There's only two ways that people will ever see you neck tattoo. One is if you have a dyke haircut, the other is if you have your hair up for a formal occasion. And when you're at a fancy ass wedding in a $300 bridesmaid dress, the last you want is a visible tattoo. The only thing that I want to see on the back of a girl's head is a handle. That way, I can force her to deepthroat when she's sucking me off. That, or maybe an on/off switch like Vicki on Small Wonder.  2. Ankle As far as I can tell, the only reason that a girl decides to get a tattoo on her ankle is so she can say that she has a tattoo. An ankle tattoo is usually small and pointless, much like the female ankle itself. No one is going to look at your goddamn ankle, especially if you're wearing those knee-high boots that I like so much. No one is going to fucking notice it unless you specifically point it out. And once you do, no one is going to care. Congratulations, you just wasted $50, you stupid whore.  3. One or both breasts Woman is a highly flawed being. Some of these flaws include menstruation, menopause, and extremely painful childbirth. However, God did get one thing right when he created women: breasts. Breasts are perfect. Big breasts, small breasts, fake breasts, it doesn't matter. Those round balls of fatty tissue are an exemplar of beauty. DON'T FUCK WITH THEM.  4. The lower back Don't get me wrong, lower back tattoos can be kinda hot. However, I can't respect a girl with a lower back tattoo. I'd fuck her a few times, buy her a couple of dinners, and probably even return some of her calls. But that's as far as it would go. You don't enter into a serious relationship with a girl with a lower back tattoo. You can't. After you've banged her on every surface in your apartment, you begin to realize that she's still going to have that tattoo when she's 40. If you don't end the relationship soon, someday she's going to be taking your kids to the beach in a two-piece bikini and sooner or later, your kids are going to see that tattoo and they'll start to suspect that their mommy used to be a complete whore. And they'll be right. And then you'll realize you married a total skank, one with a tattoo that doesn't look anywhere near as hot as it did twenty years ago.  And that's when you decide to lose her number and change the locks.  5. Ass cheek What the fuck is up with ass tattoos? What were you thinking, bitch? Did you think that maybe I needed something interesting to look at when I fuck you doggystyle? Sorry babe, but when we fuck doggystyle, I'm looking at the TV, not your stupid rose tattoo. SportsCenter trumps a girl's ass every goddamn time.   Girls with tattoos are 965,406 times more likely to give you an STD than ones without.  haddox@sydlexia.com  Back to how much I rule...  ¬© 2006 by Haddox",¬©

t5_2qh1a,aim2free,1340544355,"&gt; The pitchfork seller doesn't love freedom.  This is a highly ambiguous statement. Who is this ""pitchfork seller""?  Long time ago, most farmers were able to manufacture such pitchforks on their own (I can make them, as I'm en engineer and know pitchfork theory and the design is hardly a secret).  In the close future anyone with a good pitchfork specification would be able to hand such a task to their 3D printer, or to the local convenience manufacturer, or somewhat later just print them out in their own matter compiler (nanotech).  Today there are some entities that design such pitchforks according the principle [‚Äúany color that he/she wants so long as it is black‚Äù](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Model_T#Colors).  However, these pitchfork designers often want to preserve the pitchfork recipe a secret or try to monopolize the pitchfork design by e.g. patents.  But..., those who manufacture and actually sell these pitchforks, they just want to produce OEM pitchforks, to satisfy their customers, usually the entity which has monopolized a certain pitchfork design and have hired a pitchfork designer as a slave.  So... who is this pitchfork seller, you speak about?  I would say that the slave, i.e. pitchfork designer, can become much much more happy, when designing crowd sourced pitchforks.  We intend to make all these pitchfork designers, currently being employed by pitchfork monopolizers as slaves, happier and more pleased with themselves, as well as richer in many ways. [To allow any pitchfork design to be easily compiled to pitchfork matter by anyone and easily improved by anyone](http://wish-it.se/freecomputer).  PS. Thanks‚ù£ you just gave me a great idea ;-)",‚ù£

No one knew how good pippen was gonna be even in 88-90. Go check his numbers. He was decent but not amazing from 87-90 ( the years that jordan got beat by the pistons specifically). (http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/p/pippesc01.html)  But to say Lebron had no talent in Clevland is a joke. Jamison, west and Bigz were great pieces to utilize lebrons talents. They were all brought in specifically to help lebron.  When lebron begged for shooters they gave him shooters ( williams) When lebron begged for a man in the middle they got him shaq. Parker Drew Gooden Larry Hughes were other pieces for lebrons team. These were decent to above average guys. Same kinda guys Jordan had.  If you compare the Point averages for the 91 bulls vs the 2010 cavs its not much different ( jordan 31.5 Pippen 17.8 and grand 12.8 cartwright 9.6 to Lebrons 29.7 Jamisons 15.8 Williams 15.8 and shaqs 12.0)  Check out the 2009 numbers for the team PTS/G: 100.3 (13th of 30) ‚ñ™ Opp PTS/G: 91.4 (1st of 30) compared to Jordans 91 bulls PTS/G: 110.0 (7th of 27) ‚ñ™ Opp PTS/G: 101.0 (4th of 27)  To call a team that finishes 50-32 50-32 45-37 66-16 and 61-21 in the span of 5 years talentless is hogwash and you know it. They reached the finals and conference semis just to see Lebron fade in big games (2010 series vs boston ring any bells? yeah thought so).  This team was built around a superstar who couldnt perform in the postseason.  (btw i know youll bring up shaqs age (he was 37-38 his year with the cavs) but just remember that Kareem was 41 when he won his last title. He was able to prolong his career because he didnt have to be the man, the same situation  they brought in shaq to be (also kareem was the 4th leading scorer on that team, a severely diminished but nonetheless effective role, similar to shaqs role with lebrons cavs.))",‚ñ™

t5_2t9dp,SuredeathHellman,1340595571,"Fascism is an economic doctrine, I cannot agree with fascism because even if it is small it is still the merging if state/corporate power.  National Socialism is reform which takes shape depending on it's root. American ones like me, believe in the US Constitution, we don't think it's obsolete, and we don't think that turbulent times is justification to suspend our rights.   Economically, it doesn't mean anything. It shouldn't mean anything though. No more grandfathering in wealth in order to pass down the privilege to buy your way into politician approval to the top. (A liquor license in Florida, $250,000 and up, no joke, who the hell has $250,000?)  It wouldn't take much to get the economy going again. Not to sound like a smart ass, but if we stopped going on adventures in babysitting¬Æ around the world, all worry about social security and all other benefits for those dependents would vanish.   This isn't isolationism, it's following the constitution, we can still travel and trade with each other. (To counter the neo-con argument).   The recovery of America, will not happen in a matter of days, there will be a recovery period. Charity would bring us through though, in more than a few ways. Dr. Paul said during a debate, he used to work at a charity hospital for nothing, but in the end he got work experience as a result.   If we weren't in a stranglehold of gov't regulations, medical students could get right on that immediately, without having to worry about people getting free/ultra cheap healthcare suing them. Then our students could get work experience and get out of that catch 22 of never finding work because they have no work history.   My views relate to Hitler in that I have sympathy for his foreign policy. I don't want this country to speak German, and I don't want a Fuhrer/Reichstag system of government, or even the Chancellor/President/Reichstag system Hitler was going to remake after his retirement. Hypothetical retirement anyway, he lost the war and Germany was destroyed.   He planned on holding a world fair, abolishing the Fuhrer position forever, and re-splitting the powers between a Chancellor/President again which was the old German way. The Enabling act powers which were voted on every 4 years, were emergency powers in what we view as the ""crusade"" against the Comintern. (Western Judeo-Capitalism, Eastern Bolshevism)  Very detailed and profound thoughts on [Japanese National Socialism](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_7kkxMmBQg)   African Nationalism by [Louis Farrakhan](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWMKjW6Va78)   Sorry to be like this with video links, but we are so different, however it is our difference which unites us and transcends forever what anyone would call hateful racism. It matters not what color any of these men are. The more they love their heritage and culture, the more we can get along and see eye to eye.   I think the best solution to the modern American economy, can be found in Fordism, even Hitler knew this, he had a portrait of Henry Ford in his offices. Things like profit sharing.   I guess uniting the employee and the employer...goes something like this.   """"They must learn to respect each other and be respected again ‚Äì the intellectual must respect the manual labourer and vice versa. Neither can exist without the other"" - Adolf Hitler - written while in prison - 1924  We can't all be workers, some men rise above others through merit, achievement, innovation, invention, leadership, skill, talent, whatever makes them aces of their craft.   Class, is an interesting word. Here's a bit from Adolf in Munich April 12, 1922  ""THERE ARE NO SUCH THINGS AS CLASSES: THEY CANNOT BE. Class means caste and caste means race. If there are castes in India, well and good; there it is possible, for there there were formerly Aryans and dark aborigines. So it was in Egypt and in Rome. But with us in Germany where everyone who is a German at all has the same blood, has the same eyes, and speaks the same language, here there can be no class, here there can be only a single people and beyond that nothing else. Certainly we recognize, just as anyone must recognize, that there are different 'occupations' and 'professions' [St√§nde]-there is the Stand of the watchmakers, the Stand of the common laborers, the Stand of the painters or technicians, the Stand of the engineers, officials, etc. St√§nde there can be. But in the struggles which these St√§nde have amongst themselves for the equalization of their economic conditions, the conflict and the division must never be so great as to sunder the ties of race. ""  The void of materialism, is filled with the sense of nationalism. Eventually the selfish man instead of being idolized in movies like ""Wall Street"", is shamed out of existence. Instead, honorable men become role models.    However, all of this is based on the recognition of forced integration as a fraud, and respecting our culture/borders again.   Take care till next time. Hopefully I answered all your points if I didn't I'll recap. The description on the refusal to change the underlying system and go back to capitalism would be great.

So I ended up going into a lot of detail below with criticism on your site, hope you take it as helpful and not insulting, as the intention is to be helpful**  Your site is well styled although I would suggest you work on the banner alignment.  I'm not sure if you see what I see on firefox, but I would think the bottom of the nav bar with the Home icon, Wii U online, and other things should have it's bottom edge aligned with the bottom edge of the iNintendoWiiU logo.  I would think the four images that show their title when you mouse over them shouldn't rotate without input from the user (how about hover on the left/right side?).  It seems unintuitive for it to be automatic and also not have any control to do it manually if you want.  Same with the Games section, noone could possibly read your summaries before things move, at the very least stop movement when they are moused over.  Also, who ""iNintendo"".  That's really confusing, the use of ""i"" before a name of something is pretty commonly interpreted as a mac product.  382 day old ""latest tweet""?  Also you have this panel at the bottom:  &gt; Swagger Magazine  &gt; This is a widget panel. To remove this text, login to your WordPress admin panel and go to Appearance &gt;&gt; Widgets, and drag &amp; drop a widget into this widget panel.   I'd say clean up the details on the site, maybe work on a better name, and then after you've gotten a community, then go ahead and work on a facebook page, as it is it looks like a page random highschool kids put up for their band.  **Honestly good luck with this :)**.  Edit: Can you really put ""Copyright ¬© 2012 Nintendo Wii U"" at the bottom?  Edit 2: You have a big ""Join"" link at the bottom, and yet registration is disabled?  Edit 3:  I'm looking at this article: http://inintendowiiu.com/nintendo-wii-u-news/wii-u-will-not-have-used-game-ban/  I see 3 paragraphs of text, and two HUGE images telling me to share it, links to share it underneath that, and a floating bar to share it on the left site.  That is INCREDIBLY obnoxious and instantly will turn people off.  Seriously there are like 6 links to share on facebook.  Why would I send my friends here?  Edit4:  Looking at this article: http://inintendowiiu.com/nintendo-news/nintendos-stocks-drop-after-e3-presentation/  Work on your grammar some:  &gt; After last year‚Äôs E3 presentation we saw Nintendo‚Äôs stock plummet during and after event  ""after the event""  &gt; After last year‚Äôs E3 presentation we saw Nintendo‚Äôs stock plummet during and after event. This loss was due to consumer‚Äôs hesitation over the Nintendo Wii U which was revealed last year. This year, seems to be no better for Nintendo as the market followed a similar pattern.   Is the ""This loss"" in the second paragraph a lost that happened last year, or this year.  Saying ""this loss"" after the previous sentence implies it is ""last years loss"", but the phrase ""revealed last year"" implies it's this years loss.  &gt; While there was a lot of 3rd party support shown for the Wii U, a lack of 1st party games really seemed to bother investors.  How do you know that?  How do you know what bothered investors?  It could have been a hundred different things.  Edit 5:  Another article: http://inintendowiiu.com/wii-u-online/miiverse-wont-use-twitter-or-facebook/  &gt; Their reasoning is that there is no reason to add another device that connects to these networks when almost every device already does so. They would much rather create a new network that can branch out to be on other devices as well. In other words they are wanting their Miiverse network to branch off of the Wii U and 3DS and onto other online devices.   Have someone else read that paragraph out loud to you, someone who has preferably not read it.  It sounds so awkward and confusing, don't you agree?  Edit 6  Finally: http://inintendowiiu.com/wii-u-games/crysis-3-wii-u/  Lots of weird grammar stuff (again, try reading it out loud, I'm sure you'll get what I mean).  But the spacing between paragraphs is really off.  Unpolished looking.",¬©

t5_2qh1e,JohnnyNoCares,1340645729,"&gt;Effects on Driving: The drug manufacturer suggests that patients receiving treatment with Marinol¬Æ (THC) **should be specifically warned not to drive until it is established that they are able to tolerate the drug and perform such tasks safely**. Epidemiology data from road traffic arrests and fatalities indicate that after alcohol, marijuana is the most frequently detected psychoactive substance among driving populations. Marijuana has been shown to impair performance on driving simulator tasks and on open and closed driving courses for up to approximately 3 hours. Decreased car handling performance, increased reaction times, impaired time and distance estimation, inability to maintain headway, lateral travel, subjective sleepiness, motor incoordination, and impaired sustained vigilance have all been reported. **Some drivers may actually be able to improve performance for brief periods by overcompensating for self-perceived impairment.** The greater the demands placed on the driver, however, the more critical the likely impairment. Marijuana may particularly impair monotonous and prolonged driving. Decision times to evaluate situations and determine appropriate responses increase. Mixing alcohol and marijuana may dramatically produce effects greater than either drug on its own. ([NHTSA](http://www.nhtsa.gov/people/injury/research/job185drugs/cannabis.htm))  Marijuana should carry a similar warning to that of any antidepressant or heavy painkiller.  To compare it directly to alcohol is misleading at best and downright wrong at worst.  While, yes, driving  under the influence of marijuana is not the best idea, it does not necessarily make you a danger to yourself and others.  The main difference between alcohol and marijuana is the inhibitory nature of alcohol that causes reckless behavior.  Anyone who claims that marijuana does not cause at least some decrease in reaction time and awareness is wrong.  That said, it is not nearly as debilitating as compared to alcohol; more so when you account for the self correcting nature of the caution induced by anxiety.  [Anecdotal](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3xJrRQHCAg) evidence shows that driving while **mildly** intoxicated by marijuana is not very debilitating.  My own personal evidence also shows the same phenomenon.  You are aware of your own distortion and compensate by concentrating on the road, your speed, and your surroundings.  That said, if you are mildly to moderately stoned, I would not recommend driving in busy, high speed, urban areas, although they are navigable it can become overwhelming and the delayed reaction of marijuana starts to become an issue (causing missed opportunities to merge, missed turns, and lots of driving around the block to get where you intended).  If you have to take back roads to get home at midnight after a smoke sesh, take a breather, sober up, and drive safe.  Like another poster said, don't drive if you're above a [6] (more or less), which is similar to people who drive after having a beer or two.  I'd be more worried about people talking on cell phones or texting while driving. ",¬Æ

t5_2qh2p,sowatsupden,1340711250,"Taliban dismiss Time cover as 'desperate propaganda'  (AFP) ‚Äì Aug 9, 2010  WASHINGTON ‚Äî The Taliban have dismissed the use of a mutilated Afghan woman on a Time magazine cover as ""desperate propaganda"" and denied being the culprits, a US monitoring group said Monday.  The Taliban said Time was lying when it accused the group of slicing off 18-year-old Aisha's nose and ears after she fled her abusive in-laws in southern Uruzgan province last year.  ""This desperate propaganda by Time magazine has shown the whole world the lengths which the world media will go to please America, even at the cost of their journalistic integrity,"" a Taliban spokesman said.  Independent US monitoring agency SITE said the English-language statement from the Taliban spokesman was posted on Saturday on the website of the group, which calls itself the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan.  The statement accused the Americans of ""publishing these lies to divert attention of the people from their clear and disgraceful defeat.  ""This picture published by Time magazine and the barbaric story wrongly attached to Islamic Emirate is not only false, but publishing these images are against the morals and ethics of professional journalism,"" it said.  ""A lot of journalists worldwide have condemned this act of Time magazine and called it a crime against journalism.  ""As far as the story of Aisha is concerned, Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan has condemned this barbaric, inhumane and un-Islamic act and declares that this case has never been forwarded to any court or persons of Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan.""  The statement goes on to point out that under Islamic law the ""cutting of human ears and noses whether the human is alive or dead is illegal and prohibited.""  ""We call on Time and other Western media to stop trampling on their own moral principles, just to hide and divert people?s attention from America's military and political defeat by publishing such fabrications,"" it said.  ""We also call on Afghan media to stop spreading the lies of Islam-hating Western media by becoming their translators. Journalism is an important duty, thus it should not be used in spreading mischief.""  Aisha has become a symbol of a debate amongst commentators over the nature of the US mission in Afghanistan, with Time arguing Aisha's case demonstrates why the Taliban should never be allowed to return to power.  Aisha is soon to undergo surgery in the United States to rebuild her face.  Copyright ¬© 2012 AFP. All rights reserved. More ¬ª",¬©

t5_2qhkk,jmtd,1340713696,"&gt; It's not a fun thread, a lot of hurt feelings, which I didn't intend to have happen, sadface for sure.  Frankly, the majority of people complaining as far as I can see have done no work at all on a theme or a package, filing or fixing bugs or anything else of substance anyway.  &gt; Anyway, I uploaded the theme to unstable last night, should be on your local &amp; friendly mirror by now :)  Yup I installed it yesterday ‚ò∫ It coincided with gnome3's keyboard shortcuts breaking but I'm sure that is coincidence.",‚ò∫

Multi-region, code-free rewinder capable of rewinding all 6 region DVD's including RCE/REA encoded discs. NOTE: this product is intended as a novelty. All disc and MP3 media are direct access and do not truly require ""reqinding."" However, it is very fun to hear the sounds, and watch the lights of this product. We have tested the DVD Rewinder with the next generation disc media including Blu-Ray¬Æ, and HD. The DVD Rewinder also works with Sony Playstation¬Æ, XBox¬Æ, and other disc based console system media. &gt; &gt;We have very few left in stock and we do not plan to continue production after 2009.

t5_2qh2a,Gatohnegro,1340738504,"Thanks a lot for your answers.  &gt;I don't know how Dell's higher end is, but their low-end is very, very poorly made. A mac might survive a short fall in that aluminum chassis, but the DPS 15 looks to be in the same cheap plastic chassis as their other computers. If you get one, baby it (I still think there are much better options). &gt;  The XPS I consider is [the new one](http://www.dell.com/us/p/xps-15-l521x/pd.aspx?c=us&amp;l=en&amp;s=dhs&amp;~ck=mn) which look look stronger:   ‚Ä¢Machined-aluminium: Your XPS 15 is precision-cut from a single block of aluminium, for a design that‚Äôs as tough as it is striking.  ‚Ä¢Corning¬Æ Gorilla¬Æ Glass display: The premium display, engineered for high brightness, features edge-to-edge bonded Corning¬Æ Gorilla¬Æ Glass, making it extremely durable.   &gt;meh. GPU doesn't matter much for workstation type jobs, except in video editing. A 620m is very low-power and I don't know why it has 2GB of VRAM other than ""ooh, higher numbers must be faster!"" (2gb of vram is literally no different than 1gb or even 756mb here)   I guess I can use it for gaming, that would be nice after years of Mac... Also I sometimes do some FCP project at part of a side job.  &gt;sounds absolutely horrid. Get an ultrasharp [1] like this with it (excellent monitor there, and dell's monitors are much better made than their low-end PCs) &gt;  Excelent, and reasonably price.  I'll continue looking, but Dell is the only company in my country... I guess I can build it differently.  Just one more question, when I connect my HD on my wife's windows they are not recognized, what can I do? Thanks again.",¬Æ

He was a Brigadier General and a States Attorney General.  In the war with Mexico he fought a pistol duel with his commanding officer.  He manged to kill thousands of Indians by hurling them against Lincolns' army, after he won the battle he manged to lose all his gains in the counterattack. *(He was Americas chief Indian negotiator. his actions killed more Indians than any man that ever lived.)*  He's the only confederate officer to be pardoned after the Civil War.  He's the only confederate officer to have an outdoor statue of himself in Washington DC. (At the foot of ""judiciary Hill"".)  His body lies behind/under glass in a topless pyramid they call a ""Temple"" on 16th st. in Washington DC.

(Henry Kissinger will headline an event for Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney next month in Connecticut)  I could go on, but maybe you get the point.  What I'm getting at, is, this dude is not exactly a ""nobody"".  150 years ago he devised a plan for WW1 and it happened exactly as he suggested it should right down to the last detail. He also planed WW2 and it happened exactly as he had planed. He also planed WW3... Are you beginning to get the picture?  His name is Albert Pike. Google ""Albert Pike, 3 world wars"" and LOL at the Ashkenazi (Converts to ""Jew"") Jews, and why they are being allowed to act as the they have.  See:http://www.threeworldwars.com/albert-pike2.htm  TL;DR: The war must be conducted in such a way that Islam (the Moslem Arabic World) and political Zionism (the State of Israel) mutually destroy each other.

""Speak and argue with one another and make clear to me which is the best religion."" They began to dispute with one another without arriving at any results until the King said to the Christian priest ""What do you think? Of the religion of the Jews and the Muslims, which is to be preferred?"" The priest answered: ""The religion of the Israelites is better than that of the Muslims.""   &gt;The King then asked the kadi [a Muslim judge and scholar]: ""What do you say? Is the religion of the Israelites, or that of the Christians preferable?"" The kadi answered: ""The religion of the Israelites is preferable.""   &gt;Upon this the King said: ""If this is so, you both have admitted with your own mouths that the religion of the Israelites is better Wherefore, trusting in the mercies of God and the power of the Almighty, I choose the religion of Israel, that is, the religion of Abraham.  But they still even today use their Babylonian Talmud.  And so that brings me to this: Revelation 2:9. I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou art rich) and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan.

The latent trauma of circumcision can trigger later in life as unresolved and emotionally reinforced shame, depression, sexual dysfunction, insecurity, etc. and can unconsciously encourage abusive relationships or self-abuse behaviors.  Medical doctors are expected to abide by a Hippocratic Oath to provide ethical treatment and abstain from inflicting harm to their patients. The guardians and doctors agreeing to circumcisions may want to fully question whether these painful, mind-altering, and physically damaging procedures are in the best interest of the child, or if it has more to do with their own unresolved issues. If it‚Äôs due to wanting to avoid the topic of instructing a child how to properly clean his penis (which shouldn‚Äôt be any different from educating a girl about her period, reproduction, etc.), or if it‚Äôs from an assumed cultural/religious expectation that boys would be better off circumcised, then one should address the source of these beliefs before making a major decision to circumcise a child.""

Flaws that it has, off the top of my head:  - It incorrectly rejects some valid addresses, such as `foo+bar@example.com` - It incorrectly accepts some invalid email addresses, such as `_@_.xx` - Underscores are not valid in domain names. - The parentheses are not necessary and just add extra overhead (capture groups). - It's anchored at the beginning of the string, but not at the end, so it will match with any old trailing junk, such as `foo@bar.xx I am a snowman ‚òÉ` - Whoever wrote it apparently wanted the last part of the domain to have at least two letters, but instead of `([a-zA-Z])+([a-zA-Z])+` they should have written just `[a-zA-Z]{2,}`.

t5_2qh2b,P2Pdancer,1340801764,I've been playing around and like your imaging concepts. People should know this has a totally different purpose than AlienBlue (which you can also be logged into when in this app‚¨Ü). If I'm just giving constructive criticism I noticed a few bugs when on my Itouch.   I keep getting kicked out of the app when trying to view full wallpapers and am stupid or don't see a button for it but I couldn't copy the image but I just used a screen grab. Nice retina integration btw.   There's no way I could see to filter out NSFW posts. I don't care but some might.   The up and down voting is super touchy. I didn't mean to do one or the other and brushed the photo. Then I couldn't figure out if I'd successfully returned the vote to how it was. Still a great feature. Wasn't sure if I could favorite the image or just the user either but I've not had enough experience.   Those were the biggies which are actually small. The positives outweigh the bugs anyway. I will be back to sum up the awesome features I really liked. I do think it's got the best image user face I've seen on an app for reddit.   Ok...more to come but so far it's great for following people and the image galleries are superb.   Hope this helps a little. ,‚¨Ü

If you're a progressive who is feeling let down by Obama, don't feel alone.  If you're a conservative who is not enthusiastic about Romney, ditto (that term should resonate).  In either case, this decision shouldn't be too hard if you do a tiny bit of research.  Typical progressive's view:  Obama didn't come through for us on a lot of things we expected and he has continued some of Bush II's policies, but Jesus Hussein Christ, he's about 100 times better of a choice than anyone the GOP has offered, especially RMoney.  Even as a ""lesser of two evils"" vote, I'll sleep better knowing he's in office.  Plus, give the guy a break, he's faced 100% pure obstructionism from the GOP since day one (they even admitted to this being their strategy).  Typical conservative's view:  Romney may not be a true Christian and nobody in the GOP likes him, but at least he's not a black.  The blacks only want Obama because he's a black.  I swear by blue eyed, blond haired, white Jesus that Romney is a better choice because at least he is owned by people who want to keep prayer in the schools, know that abortion is more important than the economy and national security, and that the only way to save ***AMERICA!!!¬Æ*** from socialism is to elect a guy who knows how to cut taxes, and who knows that a bought and paid for electoral system is best.  ¬† ¬†    ¬† ¬†   Either way there hasn't been this clear a distinction between candidates since ever.",¬Æ

t5_2sdu8,Unrealdude,1340847563,"You picked one random game that has a lot of what-if and clashing canon plot lines for your argument? How adorable ‚ô•  The movies? Usually. Some could very well be considered canon (Bardock, History of Trunks, Fusion Reborn), while others seem like parallels to already established situations (Bojack, for example, goes a lot like the Cell finale, for example... and Tree of Might compared to the Vegeta fight.)  The games follow their own thing, as is the case with many other forms of media. Pok√©mon Adventures (manga) shares likenesses and characters with the Pok√©mon games, but they're considered separate.  The only exception I'd make to that is Dragon Ball Online, which blatantly disregards the events of Dragon Ball GT, which you disregard anyway simply, apparently, because you don't like it and was made by Toei. Even though Toriyama oversaw the production of GT, it comes down to taste, and that's not a reason to discredit a series.  So, yeah. I consider a handful of the movies canon, GT canon (even though I enjoy the extended story of DB Online more), and no video games canon.",‚ô•

t5_2sn7r,highguy420,1340896481,"I'm not sure that I do understand American's compulsions for food from a logical perspective.  It seems the best explanation is that we have been trained to believe that we do not have time to eat real food.  Therefore when we are tired or high we grab a bag of chips and eat the entire thing.    I think it has more to do with monotony of flavor.  If you grab a bag of chips when you have a reduction in blood glucose your brain will surreptitiously consume every chip in the bag.  The substance simply has too little nutrition and variability in content.  Your brain demands a large portion to make up for the lack of nutrition.   Instead I try to consume ""munchie"" meals that are varied in flavor and high in nutritional value.  One example would be a plate with a salad (topped with dried cranberries, sliced walnuts, a pear-infused vinegar and home-made strawberry syrup),  a slice of butternut squash (with melted butter, salt and pepper), and some fresh strawberries with vanilla bean infused sugar to dip them in.  By the end of that plate my brain, sober or stoned, is satisfied.  And I didn't eat an entire bag of Doritos^¬Æ.    So, I get your point, we are the fattest nation in the world.  At the same time, we are, unquestionably, one of the most self-destructive and arrogant countries in the world who will fight tooth and nail to maintain our self-destructive lifestyles even when we know that such lifestyle was perpetrated upon us by corporations manipulating our perception of reality.  We would rather play along with the corporations and their promise of the ""American Dream"" while in reality we are eating ourselves to heart disease and cancer in record numbers by consuming their overly processed and nutritionally devoid feed pellets.  So, yes, I do know the urge for some delicious munchies, and sometimes that's literally a bag of Frito-Lay^¬Æ Munchies^¬Æ snack mix, but only begrudgingly.    Eating a variety of nutrition-rich, fresh foods satiates our constant hunger.  Nutrition-rich, fresh foods are expensive to mass-produce and don't keep long, so in order to foist an international supply chain on us they must first convince us to eat primarily starchy powdered components that can easily be made into a multitude of products that are stable for long-term storage and shipping.  Look at the now-defunct ""Food Guide Pyramid"".  It was General Mills'^¬Æ propaganda that made it into our elementary school education.  Ask General Mills^¬Æ how much grain you should be eating ... I bet they say ""it should be the basis of your diet"".  Not biased at all.    We are not meant to eat from the grain trough like livestock.  We are meant to eat foods we grow and cook ourselves.  This automated production of food-like products is a new invention, and  we are not designed (neither intelligently nor through evolutionary events) to run on that fuel.  It is devoid of the nutrients we need in order to repair our body.  They feed their chicken livestock and their human livestock the same grain-based diet and both populations show constant nutrition-related illnesses.  But, as long as it is profitable... ",¬Æ

It is my approach because religion is a personal belief and in this diverse world we live in we can not say someone is wrong based on a personal belief or a curtain opinion(depending on the topic)...when I can tell them they are wrong is when they phsyically or mentally harm someone because of their religion. Say if someone liked Vinalla Ice cream ( to makr it eaiser lets say Bob is the name.) that is a personal opionion/belief like Believing in religion or not...now if Bob started calling others stupid disrespecting them etc....when they were being nice or haven't done anything to offend them...he would be wrong cause you are not stupid for liking different flavour of ice cream just like you are not wrong to have a different personal belief. Now when the person acts out in violence due religion...that man and that man alone deserves to be criticize based on his actions and how religion personally affected him. But just cause that person did that it doesn't mean they all act like it...so I guess you can critize, religion on how it cause each person to react. Plus if you actually studied it...it is hard to critize history when you haven't been taught it.   &gt; Does it apply to all ideas or just religion? Are you suggesting that you refuse to criticize any religions?  Answered above!  &gt;Are you suggesting no one should ever do this ...  Depending on how a person acts because of religion yes critize them..but if they believe in it and not hurting anyone the fine it is personal believe and I am not the person to tell you what to believe and not to believe...that is and you alone. Now if we are talking about things that are facts then yeah I cab tell you are wrong cause 1+1 doesn't equal 20! Does that helped brother!  &gt;and instead we should all respectful to all religious ideas?   Religion is a personal belief and in this diverse world we live in it is foolish to think that if someone doesn't have the same interest or personal beliefs that you do that they are wrong. The only time you can tell someone they are wrong for what they personally believe is fif they physically or mentally abuse someone because of it, cause it crosses the line.

It‚Äôs an incident one parent said started with a player‚Äôs celebration by the opposing team‚Äôs bench.  The coach‚Äôs response, allegedly, was to taunt the player every time the youth hit the ice.  Martin Tremblay has been suspended from the Vancouver Minor Hockey Association as a result, Dion DeMarco of the VMHA told the Province.   The suspension is pending a disciplinary hearing with Tremblay, who coached with the VMHA last season. It was his first year in the league, DeMarco said, but not his first year as a coach.  He inquired about coaching with the VMHA when his son was relegated to a different division of Vancouver Thunderbirds Minor Hockey Association, and all their coaching spots were filled.   DeMarco said they were in need of a coach for their 11- to 12-year-old boys, and a criminal records check as well as training from Hockey Canada was all in order. DeMarco added Tremblay‚Äôs year with VMHA was incident-free.   On Saturday, video shows Tremblay, coach of the Hornets in the UBC youth spring recreational league, tripping a 13-year-old player following a 5-4 win for his club in the handshake following the game.  ‚ÄúHe coached for us but when he was doing this, he was on his free time,‚Äù DeMarco said. ‚ÄúThis is a league run by the UBC and ultimately they‚Äôre the ones responsible for him coaching at that incident.‚Äù   One parent of the Richmond Steel, who did not want to be identified, said the incident started after the Steel player who was injured started to celebrate the opening goal.  ‚ÄúHe was celebrating and he skated by the [opposing] bench and obviously, the coach said something to him because the player then turned around and gave him the finger,‚Äù the parent said.  ‚ÄúEvery time that kid was on the ice, you could see the coach would be talking to him, trash talking him, basically,‚Äù added the parent.  ‚ÄúIt was to the point where the kid was visibly upset on the bench.‚Äù  It was the final game of an eight-game regular season with playoffs in the three-team league, which was repeatedly heated between the two clubs.  The spring league isn‚Äôt sanctioned by Hockey Canada and UBC spokesperson Lucie McNeil said the facility doesn‚Äôt manage the coaches.  ‚ÄúWe register the teams, we keep score, we hire the referee ... but the teams are independent,‚Äù McNeil said. ‚ÄúOur opinion is that by requiring the coaches to have minor hockey league experience for this kind of recreational league, up to this point we have felt it was sufficient due diligence.‚Äù  But Hockey Canada vice-president of hockey development Paul Carson said that requirement isn‚Äôt enough to absolve the league organizers of responsibility.  ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs still a lot more that goes into creating a safe and positive environment for kids,‚Äù Carson added. ‚ÄúThe private side of the game is very different.‚Äù  Carson declined to comment on the possibility of assault charges to Tremblay. DeMarco, however, was clear that the punishment needs to be firm.  ‚ÄúThere has to be a strong message,‚Äù DeMarco said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the adult, you‚Äôre the one who has to maintain your cool.  ‚ÄúI have three kids of my own, I don‚Äôt want another adult touching my kid.‚Äù  ‚Äî With files from Stephanie Ip    jgreen@theprovince.com  twitter.com/jgreengo    ¬© Copyright (c)  The Province",¬©

t5_2qpzs,I_I_I_I_I,1340924644,"With panic attacks, the very first thing to do is remember to breathe. When I have them, it feels like I cannot breathe, but sitting down and closing my eyes and actually counting the breaths can help. This takes practice. It is basically the fear/emotion center of your brain taking over, and shutting down your frontal cortex which is responsible for rational function. Recognizing exactly what is happening in your body is very helpful as well. Take some time to research what exactly panic attacks are.  Another thing I do is immediately get a glass of water. Something about the feeling of the cool liquid wakes me up a bit. Maybe if you suck on a piece of ice it might give you the ""shock"" you seemed to need (instead of stabbing yourself).  Try to keep yourself in the moment, in right now. Anxiety lives in the past and the future. Very rarely are we in a situation where anxiety is required right then. Usually you're worried about something that's happened in the past, or something that MIGHT happen in the future. Concentrate on that idea when you're not in the panic attack. Find meaning in something, anything, and bring that up to yourself when you feel like you're going to have a panic attack. I hope this makes sense.  Edit: One last thought on panic attacks, keep an active sense of where you are with anxiety on a 1-10 scale, where 10 would be an absolute full-on panic attack and 1 is emotionally numb. You want to be somewhere around a 3 in everday life, as not to be totally numb which is also unhealthy. If you find yourself at any moment rising above a 5 or a 6, proactively take time to sit down and breathe and relax until you can lower your anxiety. Practice will help! ‚ô•  Just remember, you aren't alone. You are not worthless. You add meaning to the world. ",‚ô•

One thing that you should know is that if you want to have it synched up really tight with any other synths you need to get a DIN-Synch ( five pin Roland ) to Midi converter and a MIDI interface.

Although its not for an exam-assignment it was for missing punches on my timecard for this week that needed to be approved.   From: Derpington  Sent: Friday, June 29, 2012 7:10 AM To: Bossman@derpindustries.com Subject: RE: Kronos   Well I have good news and bad news. I‚Äôll give you the good news first.  The good news is that the universe is safe from attack once again. You see, it all started when I was a boy. Around the age of 5 or 6 I went to a Cubs game at Wrigley field and my parents bought a box of Cracker Jacks. What‚Äôs interesting about this is that I‚Äôm not a Cubs fan, and I don‚Äôt like Cracker Jacks. That‚Äôs a story for another time though ‚Äì another time where life is simpler and worries are less. Anyways this box of Cracker Jacks had a pair of X-Ray glasses in them. When I put them on and looked at the scoreboard it changed the words that were on the board. They said ‚ÄúYou will be the protector of your people. Stay vigilant and hone your craft.‚Äù My craft, of course, being that of universe defending. I didn‚Äôt know it at the time, but thanks to Mr. Miagi and a bottle of Cran-Apple Ocean Spray (another story altogether) I was able to develop and master these skills in my early teens.  Fast forward to this week. Well the Aliens (ever seen ‚ÄúArrival‚Äù? Those are the ones I‚Äôm talking about.) came back. I had to make multiple inter-dimensional trips to Brazil and Buenos Aires in order to perform reconnaissance and ‚Äòhomeland defense‚Äô missions. ‚ÄòHomeland defense‚Äô in this case simply meaning ‚Äòthe entire known universe is at risk‚Äô. Fortunately all of these issues to our way of life have, yet again, been diverted. This is the good news.  The bad news is that during some of my temporal multi-dimensional travel some of my Kronos punches were impacted. After punching and then traveling back in time some of my punches appear to have been lost. I do apologize for this inconvenience, but hope that you can understand why this happened. Following is a correction of punches:  6/22 ‚Äì IN @ 6:00AM 6/26 ‚Äì Lunch OUT @ 9:45AM 6/26 ‚Äì Lunch IN @ 10:45AM 6/26 ‚Äì OUT @ 3:00PM 6/27 ‚Äì OUT @ 3:00PM  I guess what I‚Äôm trying to say is ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry that I fail at Kronos. Don‚Äôt be mad, k?‚Äù I probably messed up the 6/22 and 6/27 punches but I have NO IDEA WTF HAPPENED ON 6/26. There‚Äôs no way I could have missed 3 punches on a single day. Right? Right?

Dual core 2.8Ghz leads me to believe you might have an A6 processor installed in your system, but download CPUz to check and be sure:  http://www.cpuid.com/softwares/cpu-z.html  If you have an a6, the AMD 6670 in dual graphics mode will be a decent upgrade for your system.  If you have an A4, then worthwhile dual graphics won't be an option...but the 6670 will still perform better on it's own.  To help you filter through the copious amounts of irrelevant advice/information people are trying to give you here, remember 2 things when working within your budget/current PC:  1. You are limited by your 300w power supply 2. Even if you swap out the psu, you may be limited by the size of your tower. Measure how much space you have to mount a video card inside your chassis (and a new power supply for that matter) and cross reference that space with the dimensions of the video card before you go swapping out the power supply and installing a longer video card.  Good luck! ",¬Æ

Lets put them in RAID 6. 4x Segate 3TB in RAID 1 (2 pairs) We end up with 2 3TB drives.  We are also going to get one of the fastest SSDs on the earth. OCZ Velodrive 1.2TB PCI-E SSD  I am going to have the Velodrive as a boot drive because of ludicrous speed and run applications off SSDs then maybe dedicate  I am probably going to dedicate both of the RAID 1 HDDs to seperate VMs of may be Arch because I haven't tried out Arch.  I am going to RAID this all with a seperate RAID card. LSI 9260-8i RAID card  The justification of the money spent is that this is a dream build that is built for speed and no issues.

I know Skype isn't that much of a resource hog.  For the peripherals I would buy a flip load of screens (as much as possible). I would like to try a Daskeyboard Ultimate (I use a Razer Black Widow) and I would like to have my family member's headphones.  A C01U microphone would be nice.  I would probably get a new desk.

t5_2s4k5,aweg,1341086379,"I wholeheartedly recommend the Sager NP6165. Specs are below. I got the matte screen and I enjoy it, it makes it easier to keep the screen brightness down because overhead lights don't cast much glare on the screen. I also chose to remove all the branding, there's nothing on it at all except the serial number and my windows 7 information on the bottom. It's a very classy-looking machine, in my opinion. Would fit into an office or class environment without being ostentatious.  Performance-wise, it's been absolutely great. The only times I have issues are the times I forget to turn the dedicated video card on and I try to open up Skyrim/Diablo. Skyrim runs really beautifully on it, IMO.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but the way I understand this, they will release it some time around the (or at the same time as) GW2 launch (and that they will also give some of the ~~mouses~~ gear away in contests :D).  Either way, I can't wait to get my hands on the GW2 mouse :)",¬Æ
