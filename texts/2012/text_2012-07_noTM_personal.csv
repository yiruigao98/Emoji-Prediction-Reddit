t5_2qh2p,on_that_note,1341101933,"I dunno man,  &gt; Schizophrenia (/ˌskɪtsɵˈfrɛniə/ or /ˌskɪtsɵˈfriːniə/) is a mental disorder characterized by a breakdown of thought processes and by poor emotional responsiveness. It most commonly manifests itself as auditory hallucinations, paranoid or bizarre delusions, or disorganized speech and thinking, and it is accompanied by significant social or occupational dysfunction.  I would say that screencap reflects the following:  1. Auditory Hallucinations  2. Paranoid/ bizarre delusions ✔  3. Disorganized speech/thinking ✔  I would say 2/3 is close enough to suggest a ""touch"" of schizophrenia  ;)  **edit: I am not a doctor and have very little knowledge on neuropathology so take this with a grain of salt.**",8052,946,0,0,1,1,✔

t5_2qv8g,rageagainsthevagene,1341115471,"#I posted the link on my facebook wall before reading these comments and pulled out that EXACT quote. Here's what I had to say (read: rant) about it.  In one story, ""Sarah's height projection is 190cm (6'3""). That's the conclusion of our tests. Obviously that's a body size that a girl can't be happy with."" says Sarah's doctor who is intentionally stunting her growth via orthopedic injections.  This...is horrifying. I feel like I had really low self esteem about being tall in high school. Was I picked on for it? Sure, but who isn't picked on for something or another? But seriously, telling an adolescent girl that she needs to stop growing or forever be a freak? Does not compute. There's seriously something wrong with that. I mostly grew out of my issues with my height after venturing out into the world ... upon discovering: WHO CARES? Being tall is actually one of the things that makes me unique. Someone can't handle that? That sounds like their problem.  There's another line in the trailer from a woman (the filmmaker I think?) that goes, ""When people talk about how it's hard to be a tall woman, they're not talking about every day stuff, it's really not the end of the world. What is the end of the world is that you're single and alone.""  Wait .... ..... what??  I can't tell if this movie is just a documentary-style piece that shadows a few central ladies or if it's actually a statement that being tall sucks. If the latter, these women need to stop hiding behind the length of their shadows and step up to the challenge of feeling empowered by the things that make them unique. I wouldn't change my height given the choice. It reminds me most of my family. ♥  edit: because nazis",21818,11754,0,0,0,1,♥

t5_2qh33,EvanRWT,1341117407,"I like the general idea of the packaging, but not the execution.  The good thing is that it makes it easy for people to pick out which medication they need. Put the symptoms before the name of the medication, because people know what symptoms they're having. They don't always know what medicine treats those symptoms.  But there's a lot of bullshit they're selling too.  For example, their ""help! I have a stuffy nose"" medicine says:  *Help I have a stuffy nose contains 16 uncoated and uncolored phenylephrine tablets. Phenylephrine will take care of your nasal congestion, but it won’t really do much else. We think that’s a good thing. Many companies like to combine 2 and 3 and more different drugs to treat multiple broad conditions, instead of specific symptoms. Help® prefers to treat only the specific symptom you would like to treat. This way hopefully, you will better understand exactly what you are taking and what you are taking it for.*  This is silly. It's not intrinsically better to take single medications nor is it better to combine. You need to treat the symptoms, all of them. Usually, you won't just have a stuffy nose, your head may feel stuffy too. You may have a dull ache in the head, or feel a general malaise, not feeling well. In that case, you definitely should go for a combination of phenylephrine with ibuprofen or acetaminophen. There are a dozen such combinations at your local pharmacy. Or single versions of all of those medications. Pick what suits the symptoms.  On the same note, I see this line prominently displayed on a whole bunch of their medications:  *contains 16 uncoated and uncolored tablets*  They're making out like uncoated and uncolored tablets are better. They come right out and say it:  *Help® thinks there are good moments for candy and good moments for drugs. But it’s probably best for the candy and best for the drugs if you keep those moments separate. Help I have an aching body is 16 white ibuprofen pills that haven’t been coated in sugar, or dyed candy apple red.*  That's from their ibuprofen packaging. Again, it's bullshit. Doctors have been sugar coating pills for a century. There is no virtue to bad tasting medicine. It won't make you feel better any faster. Adding half a gram of sugar to make it more palatable, or a bit of food coloring to make it prettier is not wrong.  Sometimes, not doing these things can even hurt. For example, their ""help! I have chest congestion!"" contains 200 mg of guaifenesin. Again, uncoated and uncolored. You're supposed to take 1-2 tablets every 4 hours. The regular store equivalent would be something like Mucinex, which has 600 mg of guaifenesin, but it's slow-release coated so you only take a tablet every 12 hours. Why the hell would someone want to take a tablet every 4 hours when you could take it every 12 hours instead, just by coating appropriately?  Many drugs have enteric coatings, for example aspirin. It's a stomach irritant, and the coating simply makes it acid resistant so it dissolves in the intestine instead of the stomach, saving the stomach from needless irritation. Why not have such a coating?  It's like they're trying to sell the new-agey ""no additives! pure and natural!"" line to justify their extremely high price. But that logic is unsound.",58870,61,0,0,1,1,®

Trying to get you suspended from school, or lower marks because you have deliberate mistakes in an essay is not a positive way to Dominate someone who has put their trust in a Dominant. He should build you up in ways that have you succeed in your goals. Just because you are submissive to someone does not give them the right to get you in trouble, academically or otherwise. You were younger, and it was your first experience, but please be careful in how much you allow yourself to give up, at least till you completely trust that you are safe from harm in any way.  Secondly...you don't mention how much time you've allowed yourself and the other people to establish any common ground. Sure there are going to be first impressions that won't be good (trust your first instinct) but sometimes it takes time to establish what you may find you actually need. Like zil-horrorshow said, time may be needed by both parties. And that's not a bad thing at all.  Just like there's no perfect man/woman, there's no perfect Dominant. Preconceived notions will always lead to disappointment. Take the advice given by zil, it's really smart counsel.  There's no ""instant soup"" when it comes to ANY relationship; in a D/s relationship, there has to be deeper soul searching in order to establish whether that level of trust is possible.

Nothing is being done to fix this and the problem is getting worse  These anti psychotic medications, if you will simply please read the articles from the CBC and the WSJ instead of hiding your head in the sand, were never approved in the first place for the elderly in any drug testing by the FDA or Health Canada. In fact the FDA has always specifically recommends against use of these medications on dementia patients as have with a wink and a nod the drug companies, even though the drug manufacturers know full well the billions they make in profits from this use.    The State of New York Attorney General won a multi million dollar fine on one of the manufacturers for knowingly marketing these drugs to doctors for ""off label"" use on dementia patients, which amounted to a drop in the bucket of the profits these companies make on these drugs.  All use of these drugs in the elderly has always been ""off label"" right from the start.  example:  http://www.risperdal.com/safety.html  ""IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR RISPERDAL ®  Elderly Patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with atypical antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death compared to placebo. RISPERDAL ® (risperidone) is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis. ""  Yet this drug is one of the most widely prescribed of all drugs, even more than heart or diabetes medication, for dementia patients according to the Wall Street journal.  The fact that this drug and others like it are in massive use in nursing homes to chemically restrain the patients from wandering around bothering the nurse's beauty sleep has been known about by government, by the medical associations and the drug manufactures for decades.  My choice not to eat an animal like a lobster that looks appetizingly like a giant mosquito and makes its living on the ocean floor scavenging for dead and decaying fish droppings is my business. And slavery was abolished by the Jewish courts thousands of years ago, and in any event the slavery laws in the Torah were extremely progressive for the time, 3000 years ago,  forbidding murder, injury or mistreatment of slaves, and allowing them to be periodically freed.

El asesor especial de la Presidencia de la República brasileña para asuntos internacionales, Marco Aurelio García, aseguró que el gobierno brasileño no ejerció presión para que Venezuela fuese incluida en el bloque, como había sugerido el canciller Luis Almagro.  ""Eso no corresponde al estilo de la política externa brasileña y menos todavía al de la presidenta Dilma"", dijo García en declaraciones recogidas por el diario Folha de Sao Paulo.  La declaración fue hecha como consecuencia de las declaraciones de Luis Almagro, quien afirmó que ""no está dicha la última palabra"" sobre el ingreso de Venezuela, y que el presidente terminó aceptando la propuesta de Venezuela como una muestra de “realpolitik”. El vicepresidente Danilo Astori también se manifestó en contra del ingreso, calificándolo de ""muy negativo"".  García fue más allá, y afirmó que la decisión de incluir a Venezuela en el bloque fue propuesta por José Mujica y acatada por los demás países. Folha asegura que el político brasileño habló este lunes con Mujica y que el presidente uruguayo confirmó este posicionamiento favorable a Venezuela.  ""Fue una decisión unánime y una decisión que reflejó un consenso político"", afirmó García, quien además aseguró que Brasil no presionaría de esa manera a gobiernos ""con los que tenemos una asociación tan íntima"" como Uruguay y Argentina.  Además, el jerarca brasileño reafirmó la posición del gobierno brasileño de no imponerle sanciones económicas a Paraguay.  También Argentina. También en la noche del lunes, la cancillería argentina emitió un comunicado en el que si bien no es tan explíctico como García, deja en claro que “el ingreso de Venezuela como miembro pleno del Mercosur fue una decisión unánime de los presidentes de la Argentina, Brasil y Uruguay durante la Cumbre de Mendoza”.  “El día viernes, luego de una reunión de Dilma Rouseff, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner y José Mujica, donde escucharon las posiciones de sus cancilleres y los asesores jurídicos de los gobiernos de Brasil y la Argentina, los presidentes resolvieron el ingreso de la República Bolivariana de Venezuela en una reunión a solas. El análisis de los asesores legales presentes también fue unánime en que el ingreso de Venezuela cumple estrictamente con los tratados del Mercosur y las legislaciones nacionales de los países partes”, prosigue el texto.  “La resolución aprobando el ingreso fue consensuada entre los cancilleres de las tres países y los asesores jurídicos y aprobada por los presidentes”, agrega el texto, que también, sin  nombrarlo, descarta la hipótesis que mencionó el canciller Almagro, de que el ingreso venezolano al bloque aún no está decidido.  “La ceremonia de ingreso se llevará a cabo el 31 de  Julio próximo en la ciudad de Río de Janeiro con la presencia de los presidentes de Argentina, Uruguay, Brasil y Venezuela”, cierra el texto.",12671,6849,0,0,0,0,©

t5_2qm7x,kaminix,1341351969,"I was quite the meat lover for a big part of my life. Then in last year of high school a lot of my friends were going veg for environmental reasons and I was like ""lol, you fools."". Then they actually challenged me with real arguments, and sure I could laugh at them all I wanted for going veg but I don't turn down a debate (especially didn't in high school). And being the big debater I was I hated it when people just stick to their points because they feel strongly about something or whatever (without any valid arguments), so surely enough when I ran out of arguments I went vegetarian. It really was that ""easy"" for me, even though I loved meat before that it just wasn't defendable from an environmental point of view.  Eventually I somehow reasoned vegetarian was too expensive, I think mostly because I was too lazy to cook properly and it resulted in me eating lots of fastfood or frozen food from the store. So I rationalised that maybe I'll go veg again after graduating.  Then after about a year of non-vegetarianism I got into it on moral grounds again (not environmental, I'm not very environmentalist anymore even though I see it as a bonus) and still going strong after about 8 or 9 months. Had no difficulties sticking to it whatsoever this time (had fish like three times but lots of seafood, I kind of see shrimps and oysters as insects so they don't matter to me at all).  Oh, and before my 2nd veg coming (I tried out vegan first so veg actually isn't wrong!) I was really into sausages as I had found a place selling polish ones (my mother's polish, so I have a lot of sausage eating from my childhood). However even with that it really wasn't a hard transition. I don't mind people seeing my effort to turn veg/pesc as some grandiose feat. but rather than that I'd prefer it if they just saw how simple it is and decided to try it out themselves. ♥",14939,1997,0,0,1,1,♥

t5_2qh4r,mvlazysusan,1341497134,"I'm gonna describe someone, and you stop me when you know who he is and why it's important...  He was a Brigadier General and a States Attorney General.  In the war with Mexico he fought a pistol duel with his commanding officer.  He manged to kill thousands of Indians by hurling them against Lincolns' army, after he won the battle he manged to lose all his gains in the counterattack. (He was Americas chief Indian negotiator. his actions killed more Indians than any man that ever lived.)  He's the only confederate officer to be pardoned after the Civil War.  He's the only confederate officer to have an outdoor statue of himself in Washington DC. (At the foot of ""judiciary Hill"".)  His body lies behind/under glass in a topless pyramid they call a ""Temple"" on 16th st. in Washington DC. (Google-earth: 38°54'49.28"" N 77°02'09.20"" W)  Henry Kissinger recently republished 8 of his books. (Henry Kissinger will headline an event for Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney later this month in Connecticut)  I could go on, but maybe you get the point.  What I'm getting at, is, this dude is not exactly a ""nobody"".  150 years ago he devised a plan for WW1 and it happened exactly as he suggested it should right down to the last detail. He also planed WW2 and it happened exactly as he had planed. He also planed WW3... Are you beginning to get the picture?  His name is Albert Pike. Google ""Albert Pike, 3 world wars"" and LOL at the Ashkenazi (Converts to ""Jew"") Jews, and why they are being allowed to act as the they have.  See:http://www.threeworldwars.com/albert-pike2.htm  TL;DR: The war must be conducted in such a way that Islam (the Moslem Arabic World) and political Zionism (the State of Israel) **mutually destroy each other**.   Q: If you had not one racist bone in your body, what would a ""race"" have to do to you, for you to want to kill that ""race""?  A: What ever your answer... TKS! That is exactly what they need to do to get this ball rolling!  *PS: Any talk about a ""new religion"" is code for ""science"".*    ☹  http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/khazars1.asp (That's from Fordham University) There were a few Israelites and the king and subjects of a huge powerful kingdom was to convert to one of three religions en-mass, and were tricked into not converting to ""Israelites"" but converting to ""Jews"" (Notice how the king was corrected about the difference by the Christin):  &gt;On the third day he called all the sages together and said to them. ""Speak and argue with one another and make clear to me which is the best religion."" They began to dispute with one another without arriving at any results until the King said to the Christian priest ""What do you think? Of the religion of the Jews and the Muslims, which is to be preferred?"" The priest answered: ""The religion of the Israelites is better than that of the Muslims.""   &gt;The King then asked the kadi [a Muslim judge and scholar]: ""What do you say? Is the religion of the Israelites, or that of the Christians preferable?"" The kadi answered: ""The religion of the Israelites is preferable.""   &gt;Upon this the King said: ""If this is so, you both have admitted with your own mouths that the religion of the Israelites is better Wherefore, trusting in the mercies of God and the power of the Almighty, I choose the religion of Israel, that is, the religion of Abraham.  But they still even today use their Babylonian Talmud.  And so that brings me to this: Revelation 2:9. I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou art rich) and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan.  Now here is a nifty little blood test that can tell the difference: http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Health/genetics.html  You can't make this stuff up!    ",11802,28824,0,0,1,1,☹

t5_2smai,mcdronkz,1341523471,"This photo contains a lot of interesting aspects.  The composition is well balanced, with a lot of dynamic tension. The rock and the fisherman are connected through the curve of the fishing rod, which obviously has a lot of movement, another important concept in composition. The man is looking at the end of the fishing rod, which makes it the main point of interest. There is an implied horizontal line between the man's eyes and the rock, which introduces stability and rigidity. Also, there is a triangular shape formed the top and bottom of the man and the rock, which also contributes to the rigidity of the composition. The longer you look at it, the better it gets.  The color scheme is muted and fairly neutral, with the man and the line of his fishing rod as the only color accents. The detail in the shadows and highlights is remarkable. This is what gives the photo its painterly quality. The dynamic range of this scene is not extreme, but you will probably have to capture it using several exposures. Furthermore, the atmospheric effects in the background contribute a lot to the depth and realism of this photo.  It wouldn't be hard to achieve such a look with a few Adobe® Photoshop® adjustment layers. Lower the global saturation, add contrast using an S-curve and use 'selective color' or 'color balance' to add a bit of blue into the shadows. You may want to combine different exposures using separate layers and layer masks. There may be a lot more to it depending on the original footage, but this should definitely push you in the right direction.  One word of caution: doing this kind of post production on an flawed photograph without a strong composition or color scheme isn't going to get you anywhere.

In words what I wrote is:   Axiom 1 ""(if P then Q) if and only if (if not-Q then not-P)""  Axiom 2 ""A is possible if and only if A isn't necessarily false""  ""If A is possibly false then A is necessarily possibly false"" (S5)  ""If A isn't necessarily possibly false then A isn't possibly false"".  ""If not necessarily not necessarily A then necessarily A""  ""If possibly necessarily A then necessarily A"" which is Plantinga's S5 ____________________________________________________________________________ To explain, by S5 we can say ""If A is possibly false then A is necessarily possibly false"". By using the first axiom I can reverse the if-then statement to: ""If A isn't necessarily possibly false then A isn't possibly false"".  Now by axiom 2 (and by definition) ""A isn't possibly false"" becomes ""A is necessarily true"" (if A can't be false, it must be true). The first half can also be changed via axiom 2 to get: ""If A isn't necessarily not necessarily true then A is necessarily true"", which we can simplify to ""If not necessarily not necessarily A then necessarily A""  The first half of this is the same as ""B isn't necessarily false"" where B is the statement that A is necessarily true. This is equivalent by axiom 2 to ""B is possibly true"". Thus our compounded statement simplifies to:  ""If possibly B then necessarily A"" or by replacing B with ""necessarily A""  ""If possibly necessarily A, then necessarily A""  ",4661,438,0,0,1,1,↔

t5_2qqjc,jimmypopali,1341550865,"**Part IV**	 Bank Error In My Favor: Collect $95,000 / ORIGINAL version. © 1995 Patrick Combs  Learning My Rights   I arrived in New York still quite shook up from the telephone call with the Security Officer. The words 'fraud' and 'policemen' and 'not willing to cooperate' kept echoing in my head. I decided it was time to learn my rights.   A few quick phone calls to law schools and I had a list of Bay Area lawyers who specialized in banking and checks. I decided to call Manuel Fields first because of his specialty, check fraud.   I told Manuel my first name and asked him if I could tell him my situation to determine whether or not I needed a lawyer. ""Sure"" he said. I told him the entire story (without mentioning the amount of the junk mail check). He laughed a bit and asked, ""Exactly how much was this check for??"" I was really hesitant to tell a lawyer the astronomical amount, but I couldn't lie so I said, ""$95,093.35."" Next, for what seemed like a full minute, all I heard was a man laughing very very hard. ""I'm sorry,"" he said after he completed his laugh. ""I've just never heard of anything like this.""   Manuel went on to inform me of things that further amazed and intrigued me:    * According to Commercial Paper Law the money was now legally mine, because all checks are first assumed to be valid -- and the way a bank invalidates a check is by serving the depositor with a timely notice of dishonor. Considering that it took my bank 33 days to tell me my check had been returned, he did not think they had dishonored the check in time.   * Fraudulent checks ARE a different manner. But he said, ""Since you deposited the check 'thinking there was no chance it would cash, and without even endorsing it' -- you didn't commit fraud.""   * Getting the cashier's check was also not an act of fraud, since the bank had previously assured me the check could no longer be returned.   * There are two practices of law as seen through the eyes of a court: (1) Black Letter of Law, where the court rules strictly by the law (and I would be awarded the money) and (2) Chancery Courts, also known as Courts of Compassion, where the court disregards the law when it is deemed non-sensical. He said that, ""Easily a court could disregard the law and give the money back to the bank because really you have no claim to this money from an equitable sense of the law."" And then he added, ""And when it's an individual vs. a Bank, I'm sorry to say that courts usually side with the bank.""     We agreed to speak again the next day.   When I called him I continued to protecting my anonymity by giving my first name only. It all felt so spy-like. I spoke very little and listened carefully. It had been 24 hours since we first spoke and he had these comments to add:    * I definitely didn't commit fraud because I didn't consummate an act of fraud. I had not cashed the check. But it could be perceived that I attempted to fraud the bank. Proving I had not would require a legal deposition that detailed what I was thinking when I made the deposit and what expectations I had about what I'd do if the money showed up in my account.   * The burning question now (for legal purposes) was, 'WHERE did the money come from?' He presumed the bank in Ohio (The get-rich-quick company's home state), was the bank that was minus $95,093.35. And he stated that they would have to eat the loss if they hadn't sent the check back to my bank on time.    We ended the conversation with no plans to speak again.   The next part of my vacation was at my brother's house in Boston. It was a two week family get-together -- my mom and God son were also there. We spent very little time talking about the money, but when we did everyone thought it was an amusing incident, everyone except my Mom. It stressed her out a lot. She worried that the bank would get meaner and meaner, and that they might try to throw me in jail. One day I jokingly told her I was going to buy her a Lexus with presents in the back. She smiled for an instant and then she pinched my arm and said, ""You better not!""   My Mother helped me a considerable amount. One day I went into my brother's home office. I was upset because I had requested a photocopy of the check from my bank and instead they had sent me a photocopy of someone else's $6.71 check. I wanted to see what the sample check I had deposited looked like. It seemed like my only option was to call the Security Officer with my request. But then my Mom came in and pulled up a chair next to me. After hearing what I wanted, she said, ""Patrick you don't have to speak to a Security Officer about this. Call the President of the Bank. Haven't I taught you to deal with VIP's?! They're the ones with true power."" And then, as I tried to reach the President of First Interstate Bank by phone, my Mom just sat there giving me strength.   It took many phone calls (more than it should!) to find out the name and number of the President, and when I did call for Bill Siart, I was told that the Consumer Affairs Department was as close as you can get. I reached the manager of the department and said, ""I have a problem with my branch office and I'm looking for help. I want to resolve this amicably, without a lawyer, but I'm having a lot of trouble speaking with anyone who wants to help me handle this fairly."" Instantly the manager became helpful. I requested a photocopy of the front and the back of the check and an official letter from the bank. When I told her that Robert Gage in Security had denied me a letter, she recognized Gage as someone high up in Security, and she assured me she would call him and see if it was possible for me to get such a letter. She lived up to her promise because by the next day Robert Gage was faxing the things I requested to me in Boston.   What arrived by fax was a surprise. It was incredible to see the and back of the check. I had not remembered just how real it looked -- and it was actually the first time that I could confirm that it in fact matched all nine criteria for a negotiable instrument. Up until then I had just been working from memory.   But what really surprised me was the 'official letter' from my bank stating the check's return. What came out of the fax machine wasn't any sort of letter from my bank -- it was a memo from First Chicago Bank -- and it was a piece of the puzzle of how this whole thing could have happened.  The memo (which had the amount of my check on one line and the word 'non-negotiable' circled on another) had a name and phone number for an Account Adjuster on it. I decided to call. My brother always says, ""More information is always good.""   I reached the man on who had written the memo. I explained to him who I was and why I was calling. He explained that the memo I now possessed was the notice of dishonor that he sent to my bank about the $95,093.35 check. On the same day that he sent the memo, his bank also reclaimed $95,093.35 from my bank. So MY bank was out the money! ""Yes,"" he confirmed. ""All the other bank's involved have recovered their money.""   Suddenly it dawned on me, this memo was dated June 5th. That's the day my bank learned that the check had been dishonored. Why they waited until June 21st to notify me was a mystery, especially considering that legally they were supposed to notify me by Midnight of June 6th! No doubt about it now, my bank had made a big mistake -- AND they faxed me a memo to prove it!   At the end of the conversation this man did me another big favor, he obliged my request for the names of the other banks involved. He didn't even mind telling me who I should ask for directly and what item number I should reference.   From calling the other banks involved I learned the movement of the check and the details of the fiasco. I deposited the check on Friday, May 19th. On Monday, May 21st it was overlooked by my bank and sent onto the bank in Chicago that was acting as a clearinghouse. It was again overlooked there. The next day, on May 22rd, it was sent onto the Federal Reserve Bank in Cleveland OH and this bank rejected the check, calling it a 'non-cash' item (Whether or not it SHOULD have been rejected as a 'non-cash' item is questionable in my mind considering what I learned about the meaninglessness of the words 'non negotiable' on a check, but that's what the FED said). Take note that the FED Bank rejected the check within 48 hours of when it left my bank. The check was then routed to the get-rich-quick company's bank in Cleveland. The Cleveland bank says they sent a notice of dishonor immediately to the bank in Chicago. I cannot confirm when the Cleveland bank actually sent their notice of dishonor, but I do know that the bank in Chicago sent my bank notice of dishonor on June 5th.   I've read that bank computers are programmed to bring special attention to checks above $500. Can anyone tell me why any bank would delay attending to a dishonored $95,093.35 check with the words 'non-negotiable' on the face, when they know they have a Midnight Deadline?? If you're Commander of the NASA control room, and you notice a disastrous leak five minutes before the shuttle launches, that is something you attend to immediately. (I know, bad analogy).   Back to the story. After learning the path of the check, I made an entry into my journal:   The bank knows they made a big mistake. But instead of calling me and explaining their mistake, they called and bullied me with scare tactics, ""banking"" on my being ignorant and fearful. Apparently they feel they're powerful enough to avoid admitting to their mistakes and powerful enough to deny me even the right to fair treatment -- refusing to even send me a letter about this. I don't think they're that powerful.""",17378,4626,0,0,1,1,©

t5_2qh1i,inside_your_face,1341574958,"Cambodia, 1986 (4 years since Betrayed Horse first attempted to purchase a drink in a bar).   Deep in the heart of the Cambodian jungle resided a creature so fierce and menacing that the villagers in the surrounding settlements feared to speak its name…   The townspeople of Anlong Romiĕt had begun assigning guards to watch over the village at night, but to no avail, the kidnappings continued… The number of people who had gone missing was in the hundreds now; there was no pattern, just random disappearances and occasionally signs of a struggle...   The creature had become aware of the villages recent attempts to increase security and left a warning written in blood on the village hall for everyone to see, it translated roughly to ""Don’t oppose me, I’ll kill you bitches”.   There had been a meeting between the nearby towns law enforcement agencies and a crack team of mercenaries was being assembled, “Bring me the head of the creature who has terrorised this place for so long,” spoke the man at the podium, “and you will be rewarded beyond your wildest dreams”, he continued, “honestly, you’ll get cars and houses and… woman and… cakes… whatever you want.”   The mercenaries set out into the jungle at dawn the next morning, in search of the heinous monster… A group of 40 armed men… Their numbers would decrease rapidly; their blood would be spilled…   (To be continued).   The mercenaries had been feeling a cold chill and the rustling of trees branches as they moved through the thick jungle. Each one tried to convince himself it was ‘just the wind’ but each one had their doubts… They stopped to rest and have a headcount after 4 hours of struggling through the dense overgrown wilderness; despite being extremely experienced, their tracker was having difficulty following the trail of the daunting creature. Its tracks resembled that of the letter “u”, he had never seen anything like it… “Johnson” shouted the soldier clutching the clipboard in charge of the headcount. “We’re two short.” “You’re 5”8 private, don’t be too hard on yourself,” replied the general. “No, I mean we’re missing two men.” “Oh, why are you missing them?” “Missing from our group…” “Oh I understand fully now. That was a funny mix-up though, that would’ve gotten a lot of laughs if it wasn’t for the gloomy nature of the situation.” “Yes, it would’ve been hilarious,” continued the soldier as he handed him the clipboard. “We should write it down and send it to someone.” “Don’t be ridiculous, only an idiot would read this nonsense…”   They continued on, despite not discussing the strange disappearance of the two men, which they both conveniently forgot about after their hilarious misunderstanding. Hours later the entered a clearing and the tracker abruptly stopped. Everyone held their breath intently, he sneezed and carried on. “I thought something intense was going to happen there,” said one man, “I’m pretty glad it didn’t though. I mean, if I was watching someone else do this or reading about it then yeah it’d would’ve been interesting if something had happened, but as it’s actually happening to me in real life I’m quite eager to stay safe, I really don’t want to get inju-“ The man’s sentence was cut short. “AAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH, I’LL KILL YOU BITCHES!” As a machete flew from between the trees and cut the man’s face off, like John Travolta in “Face Off.” It fell to the floor like a thin cut pepperoni pizza. “Want fries with that?” Shouted the creature as it pulled of its aviator sunglasses in a cool 80’s police drama fashion and pulled out an AK47 and started shooting towards the group. They scattered, still dazed from how quickly it had all happened. “Draw your weapons!” shouted the general. Seven men went down before they could get pencils out. The rest quickly got to work sketching pictures of machetes and AK47s. “Shoot the thing! We’ll do artwork later.” Screamed the general, but before even a shot was fired, the creature was gone…   There were only 14 men left now, they got seriously annihilated. “What was that creature?” one of the remaining few asked the group. “It looked like a horse.” “Don’t be ridiculous…” one man replied incredulously…   (To be continued)   There was a profound silence throughout the night as the mercenaries slept, broken only by what appeared to be the sound of coconuts being hit together, and occasional sobs from the distraught men. “Letting them watch `Marley and me’ before bedtime was a bad idea.”  The general said to the guard who was keeping watch. “What a bunch of wimps.” The guard replied through stifled crying. “General,” he continued, wiping away the rain that had landed on his tear ducts, “what are the chances we’re going to make it home alive? I’d sure like to see my wife again.” “I really don’t- wait, really? Your wife is gross man, I thought the only reason you came on this trip was to get away from her.” the general replied in disbelief. “When I first met you both I thought you were the woman.” “Hey, you watch your mouth, she’s been post op for over 4 years now.” The guard snapped. “Okay, settle down, anyway, to answer your original question, when you say `will we make it home’ it’s quite uncertain. Personally, I’ll make it home fine as I keep this lucky horseshoe with me at all times.”   The creature had been watching the mercenaries for days now, stalking them, not making his presence known yet keeping in close proximity to the group; letting their fear develop, he was waiting for his opportune moment to strike… Building the tension, one might say…   The general had called for re-enforcements after the attack a few days ago which greatly reduced their numbers. The re-enforcements turned up the next day. A jeep load of men from the village, they couldn’t have been more than twenty years old. As they pulled the jeep into the camp, the mercenaries pointed and laughed at their parking skills…   “We’ve lost a lot of good men on this mission!” The general addressed the group, “such as Steve, Graham, and some others, I can’t really remember anyone else. Isn’t it strange how we all have such western names despite being Cambodian, and how we all speak perfect English?” The men nodded in agreement. “Let’s honour those men by finding this creature and avenging their deaths!” The general shouted.   They carried on deeper into the jungle, arbitrarily following the general who insisted he knew how to track the creature, little did he know, he was the one being tracked…  An air of morbid resignation hung over the Cambodian jungle, and the heads of those who occupied it, the time of their reckoning had come.   The group had been silent for a number of hours now, they had come across a dismembered body a few miles previously, and they now seemed to be wading through the carrion… Lifeless eyes stared up at them from the overgrown jungle floor and occasionally their motionless cadavers would be strung up in trees with vines, hanging like icicles from desolate window sills… (This is getting quite dark and poetic).   A feeling of unease spread throughout the group like a virus, some of them had heard what seemed to be the sound of drums, some believed it was the sound of bones cracking…   After struggling through many miles of the dense, humid rainforest they arrived at a river, it was as wide as two tennis courts, and there wasn’t a crossing in sight. “It looks like we’ll have to swim across.” said one of the young men from the reinforcement team. “Really?” said the general in a sarcastic tone. “That’s an ingenious idea. I was going to suggest flying, or building a giant catapult and firing ourselves across to the other side.” “No need to be a dick about it.” said the young man, dismayed.   The troop waded through the murky water, exhausting all their energy against the current which yearned to pull them to their deaths. The first man reached the shore, there was a loud crack and the troop froze. A branch had fallen in front of the man. A full minute of silence passed, you could have heard a pin drop, had they not been in a river. Each and every man scoured the surrounding jungle.   The man on shore turned cautiously, “must’ve just been the wind, or some-“ his sentence was cut short and he choked as a machete emerged from his chest. The men gasped, “THE RIVER WILL RUN RED WITH YOUR BLOOD. YOUR FAMILIES WON’T RECOGNISE YOUR BODIES. Basically, I’LL KILL YOU BITCHES!” The creature leapt from nowhere, its lifeless eyes the colour of DietCoke®, blood dripping from its dagger sharp teeth.   Before the mercenaries could even draw their weapons, the creature was in the water; it tore throats out with its teeth, smashed skulls with its kick and issued a cold cackle as it slaughtered the group of helpless soldiers with its bare hands (hooves). Not a shot was fired, nor a knife drawn… Betrayed horse lay on the bank of the river surveying his destruction, the river had turned red with blood and the bodies of the men were being pulled down river by the current.   There was nothing left for him here… He had exhausted his resources. He would move on from this place, continue his journey, after one last visit the village, he wanted dessert…",77980,34483,0,0,1,1,®

t5_2qore,Globbi,1341590740,"If you spend all your money on melee crit build you can definitely get it going enough to even get through act 3. I wouldn't recommend full tank build, if you don't go with another DPS char you would have problems with enrages. To get enough crit%, overall dps and enough resistance you would have to spend a lot.  Depending on build you may need different numbers of crit% and ap/crit. I use no spectral blades but only tornadoes and explosions (still experimenting with my build though) and need about 15 ap/crit total to have it efficient with total crit% near 40. It's quite a lot but not that hard to get it if you sacrifice some stats and this build doesn't need attack speed.  You don't need boots with movespeed so you can get int/vit/res pretty cheap. Tanky gloves with crit chance but no AS should not be too costly (you will have to drop crit dmg on gloves though, it makes them many times more expensive). On weapon you need socket and ap/crit but it's cheap if you sacrifice damage (I got wand under 600 dps when I first tried this build and did ok in act 3). Life on hit is nice but can be omitted until act 3.  Scoundrel gives you 3% crit ♥.  I find teleport with fracture essential. I can't stand in desacration, arcane beams or get frozen so I have move around a lot. Teleport is much faster than walking and recharges quickly from crit procs. On some mobs I also constantly use tp to just get images - archers with nightmarish that keep distance from you are difficult to be kept in place all at once so distractions help a lot.",15486,158,0,0,1,1,♥

t5_2qh33,morpheousmarty,1341600427,"I've been trying it since I wrote that comment. First, let me clarify that not all your traffic will go through their servers. They explain it here, and with a DNS there's little more they could do, unless they redirect you to fake sites.   &gt;How does it work? Tunlr does not provide a virtual private network (VPN). Tunlr is a DNS (domain name system) unblocking service. We’re using sophisticated technologies (a.k.a. the Tunlr Secret Sauce ©) to re-adress certain data envelopes, tricking the receiver into thinking the envelope originated from within the U.S. For these data envelopes, Tunlr is transparently creating a network tunnel from your location to our U.S.-based servers. Any data that’s not directly related to the video or music content providers which Tunlr supports is not only left untouched, it’s also not even routed through Tunlr. In order to use Tunlr, you will have to change the DNS address.  All in all it works, it as safe as it could probably be without costing them thousands of dollars.   My opinion is use at your own risk, but it is transparent enough that it would be hard to hide if it was malicious. ",201751,3446,0,0,1,1,©

t5_2qh4r,master_baiter,1341644998,"Desiderata  Go placidly amid the noise and haste, and remember what peace there may be in silence.  As far as possible without surrender be on good terms with all persons.  Speak your truth quietly and clearly; and listen to others, even the dull and ignorant; they too have their story.  Avoid loud and aggressive persons, they are vexations to the spirit. If you compare yourself with others, you may become vain and bitter; for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.  Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans.  Keep interested in your career, however humble; it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time.  Exercise caution in your business affairs; for the world is full of trickery.  But let this not blind you to what virtue there is; many persons strive for high ideals; and everywhere life is full of heroism.  Be yourself.  Especially, do not feign affection.  Neither be critical about love; for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment it is as perennial as the grass.  Take kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering the things of youth.  Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune. But do not distress yourself with imaginings.  Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness. Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself.  You are a child of the universe, no less than the trees and the stars; you have a right to be here.  And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should.  Therefore be at peace with God, whatever you conceive Him to be, and whatever your labors and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life keep peace with your soul.  With all its sham, drudgery and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful world. Be careful. Strive to be happy.   © Max Ehrmann 1927 ",4978,1885,0,0,1,1,©

t5_2rzgi,BobisOnlyBob,1341649198,"&gt;I don't even know which ones are antagonists or protagonists or what the plot is or anything.  Plot varies from game to game; [Defeat Means Friendship](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatMeansFriendship ""☢CAUTION!!☢ TVTropes Link""), so the antagonist of one game tends to become the ally of the next, or at least goes back to their respective supernatural domain and stays out the way. When feasts and parties happen, everyone tends to be invited, even if they've previously blacked out the skies, stolen the essence of spring, built a second sun underground to conquer the surface with, accidentally a giant robot golem, or worse. However, the main three protagonist girls barely change - [Reimu](http://touhou.wikia.com/wiki/Reimu_Hakurei), the shrine maiden in red and white; [Marisa](http://touhou.wikia.com/wiki/Marisa_Kirisame), the perfectly ordinary witch; and [Sakuya](http://touhou.wikia.com/wiki/Sakuya_Izayoi), the Maid of Time. I wish I was kidding about that last one.  Plots tend to be along the lines of ""a major incident has occurred and it's starting to piss off the humans, fairies, and *youkai* (supernatural beings) of the magical and sealed realm of [Gensokyo](http://touhou.wikia.com/wiki/Gensokyo). Reimu/Marisa/Sakuya set out to find out who is responsible for the skies being dark/winter never ending/ghosts swarming out of the earth. They magically shoot their way through a bunch of different fairies, youkai and deities until they find the one responsible, have an epic and fireworks-like battle of magical energy, and eventually the being responsible relents and restores things back to how they should be. Then everyone crashes Reimu's shrine to have tea and cake and generally piss Reimu off."" The doujins tend to deal with more everyday life and interactions between the casts of different games, their similarities, differences and conflicts.  Like I said, antagonists tend to become protagonists, so in the games where the girls have a support 'partner', they tend to be able to choose from a roster of characters from prior games, like former superboss [Yukari Yakumo](http://touhou.wikia.com/wiki/Yukari_Yakumo) can be paired off with Reimu to give her a teleport ability.  Personally I suck at the games, so I've picked this up through a mix of watching the game played on YouTube, the anime episode and shorts, and the various doujin manga (which vary wildly in their interpretations of the characters).  Oh, and did you know a Homestuck track references Touhou music? ""[Heir Conditioning](http://homestuck.bandcamp.com/track/heir-conditioning)"" is a mixture of ""[Beloved Tomboyish Daughter](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wN1BhwqX29w)"" (Cirno's theme) and ""[Solar Sect of Mystic Wisdom ~ Nuclear Fusion](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1_t1PwuegA)"" (Utsuho's theme). I think others might show up as minor mix elements, but I'm not sure.",221981,35539,0,0,0,1,☢

I had this in a bar that had a nice selection of scotches to try while waiting for dinner at another restaurant.  Lucky for me we had to wait 1.5 hours!  I had the Talisker and Caol Illa after ☺.  I had a good bar seat with friendly people around having a good time   * Price near me Bottle $41.99 US , Dram $8 * Color: It was a little dark in the bar, but amber. * Nose: Molasses with a touch of peat.  There was something else I couldn’t put my finger on.  * Taste: Smooth, excites my palate, when I held it on my tongue it would thicken nicely (nothing I have experienced with cheaper scotches), Molasses and honey, then there is the touch of peat.  Almost wished the flavors were even stronger. Excellent. * Finish: The finish lasts long and makes you pay attention (me as a novice).  Smooth with a touch of peat again.  There was a sweetness again for me, but this time it switched cinnamon.  Beginners out there, Listen to Scotchit.  Highland Park is a fantastic scotch to begin your love affair.  The taste difference between this and some bottles that cost ½ as much is substantial.  Unfortunately, as a father of 2, this can’t be my go to bottle for every weekend.  But, for special occasions, this has a spot in my life.  * Taste: 70/75 * Value: 11/15 * Uniqueness 4/5 * Would I Buy Again 5/5 * Score= 90/100 ",12894,14632,0,0,1,1,☺

When the whole wide world seems oh, so wrong... And nothing you do seems very right?  What do you do? Do you punch a bag? Do you pound some clay or some dough? Do you round up friends for a game of tag? Or see how fast you go?  It's great to be able to stop When you've planned a thing that's wrong, And be able to do something else instead And think this song:  I can stop when I want to Can stop when I wish. I can stop, stop, stop any time. And what a good feeling to feel like this And know that the feeling is really mine. Know that there's something deep inside That helps us become what we can. For a girl can be someday a woman And a boy can be someday a man.  What Do You Do with the Mad that You Feel? By Fred M. Rogers © 1968",7958,169,0,0,1,1,©

t5_2qore,AVIDeoGAMER,1341690579,"It's the Theory of Forumcrafting, not a virus. Blizzard PR agents are downvoting me into oblivion for making fun of the game! Here, I'll just post it here for all to see:  OFFICIAL! The end is nigh!

A great man once said, ""Aren't you thankful?"".  ----------------------------------  All of you guys who have problem progressing in this game is because you guys are noobs and whiners! YOU ARE NOT WORTHY! (by Steak)  ----------------------------------  This game sucks. All I want is to play solo and enjoy the solidary time but with this World of ForumWhatever this is impossible! Blizzard if you make it offline so I can create thread and reply to my own thread without anyone's else comments then I will consider purchasing this. For now, it's a no for me.

More seriously, I agree, single resistances should be higher. There could be affixes for double resists (fire + physical ♥ instead of resist all) giving a bit higher than those giving all. I would like having more interesting options. On the other hand it would make gear rolls even more random, with cold resistance pretty useless (and it's also a bad design that one resist is useless).

t5_2r9tk,Hiskitten,1341805512,"No question is insensitive or ignorant - if you don't ask it, how would you know how others deal with these issues? ☺  i'm not 24/7, He's out of town, but there are ALWAYS issues that we deal with in a committed relationship. So i can only speak from the point of view of an LDR. There are times i need to talk to Him about things that are bothering me...and while i keep my respect for Him at all times - i can't see Him in any way less than respected by me - i am free to express myself to Him.   The key is mutual respect. If you're in a 24/7 relationship in ANY dynamic, if you don't respect one another and can't communicate honestly, there's something wrong. That's relationship 101, not even lifestyle-related. But in the lifestyle where there is a power exchange, i would hope it's known that any issues can be discussed as long as there is that respect. If the submissive cannot - or is not allowed to - express those views as an equal for the time of conversation, at least there can be honest communication with expressions of one's status. For example, if i have something i want to discuss with my Master, i'll ask for permission to speak freely. It is ALWAYS granted. He is the kind of person who ALWAYS asks my thoughts, no matter what we're discussing. But in matters where it is not related, directly, to the lifestyle, He actually expects me to express them. Honestly, openly, with the same respect any couple shows one another.  i am interested to hear the responses of those in a 24/7 TPE...for the future, ya know. ;-)  Hope this isn't too muddled and you can get something from my reply...i'll be happy to clarify if not.",392,1,0,0,0,0,☺

t5_2r9vp,ballin_shogun,1341871098,"Dude, read your study again. You obviously didn't understand it the first time.   &gt;Effects on Driving: The drug manufacturer suggests that patients receiving treatment with Marinol® should be specifically warned not to drive until it is established that they are able to tolerate the drug and perform such tasks safely. Epidemiology data from road traffic arrests and fatalities indicate that after alcohol, marijuana is the most frequently detected psychoactive substance among driving populations. Marijuana has been shown to impair performance on driving simulator tasks and on open and closed driving courses for up to approximately 3 hours. Decreased car handling performance, increased reaction times, impaired time and distance estimation, inability to maintain headway, lateral travel, subjective sleepiness, motor incoordination, and impaired sustained vigilance have all been reported. Some drivers may actually be able to improve performance for brief periods by overcompensating for self-perceived impairment. The greater the demands placed on the driver, however, the more critical the likely impairment. Marijuana may particularly impair monotonous and prolonged driving. Decision times to evaluate situations and determine appropriate responses increase. Mixing alcohol and marijuana may dramatically produce effects greater than either drug on its own.",1499,6,0,0,1,1,®

You're going to need to hit the gym and modify your diet. you can go hardcore and work out 4x/week if you want, but I think you'd stand a better chance of success if you went and saw a personal trainer and nutritionalist a couple times a month for guidance.

Personally, my preference is for circumcised, although it's not a dealbreaker - I've been with one guy who was uncut and he kept clean so it was fine, although we did have recurring issues with condoms. But overall I think circumcised looks hotter and is better for oral.      I'm not sure what I would do for a hypothetical son, but I would definitely want input from my hypothetical husband. I have sympathy for the position that it's painful, but I don't think it causes long-term damage. Even in the blog post linked to by Joel, the guy didn't have a problem with being cut until he started reading anti-circumcision propaganda. I also don't know any guys in real-life who wish they weren't cut, but I do know several who wish they were, including the aforementioned bf, so ultimately it seems less cruel to do it when they won't remember.     12:42 PM, October 07, 2010  The life of a stay at home mom said...      @Joel. I agree with you completely.     6:09 PM, October 07, 2010  Joel said...      learning about the practice for what it really is is not ""anti-circumcision propaganda""      If a man wants part of his body removed.. that's his choice. What if he said, ""oh, I wish my mom knew I wanted a tattoo because it hurts too much to get it done now that i'll remember!"" or ""oh, I want my nipple pierced, but it would hurt, my mom should have known to do it for me as a baby.""      At least neither of those remove thousands of nerve endings.      Is that anti-circumcision propaganda? To let someone know that they lost thousands of nerve endings? That they lost sexually-functional genital tissue?      Women have been perfectly happy to be genitally mutilated in Africa, despite living their entire lives without their clitoris (which is arguably far more important than a foreskin)... BUT THEY DIDN'T KNOW what they were missing.      Now that many of them realize that the clitoris is the favorite body part of many women, of course they're not going to be so ambivolent about the practice any more (though many still are).      Does that mean the practice of cutting the genitals of baby girls is okay?      (also for the record, there are many forms of female genital cutting, some are far less extreme than male circumcision, and some are far worse, in terms of damage caused... all forms of female genital cutting are illegal in North America, and for good reason).      I wouldn't say you aren't ""allowed"" your preference, but I think it's about on par with a man saying he prefers baby girls to have their genitals cut because he thinks it looks hotter and is better for oral.     10:14 PM, October 07, 2010  Purple Froggie Clay Stuff said...

I'm a circumcised homosexual guy.      Like Joel said, I used to be okay with (and oblivious to the detriments of) circumcision. I have recently acquired for myself an uncircumcised boyfriend, and at the same time, a daily reminder of what I'm missing. I've since done research online and have gotten pretty irrevocably sad about the state of my junk. It might seem ridiculous to you, and it might at one point have seemed ridiculous to me, to hear men talk about how they feel ""mutilated"" or ""damaged."" The truth is, it's simply not anyone's place to, like Joel said, diminish someone else's pain because he or she can't empathize.      Enjoy your circumcised men all you want, but please leave the decision to circumcise up to the participant of the surgery.      For my own part, I think uncircumcised penises are sexy, and quite frankly, I'm presented with daily evidence of how much more sensitive and just plain FUNCTIONAL they are than my own.      I hope circumcision is made illegal very soon.     9:31 PM, November 28, 2010  Brazilianbloke said...     This comment has been removed by the author.      4:21 PM, November 29, 2010  Brazilianbloke said...      I got circumcised when I was 20. I know some people say that sex feels different and that circumcision ruined their sex lives but it hasn't ruined mine at all. Of course it is a bit different as there is no foreskin but it doesn't necessarily mean it is worse now. It is just different but equally good. Lack of sensitivity? That is not true! Am I impotent due my circumcision? Not at all! I can ejaculate without any problems. Now my penis looks a lot neater, cleaner and nicer I have mo complains and sex is great.     4:31 PM, November 29, 2010  evil p0ptart said...      Thank you Brazilian Bloke, it's nice to hear it from someone who has experienced it from both sides. I'm glad you cleared up the lack of sensitivity question. As I knew that was not necessarily true, or men would not be able to ejaculate in a minute whom are circumcised!     11:52 AM, December 07, 2010  Joel said...      @evil_p0ptart - how long it takes for a man to ejaculate is based on many factors - such as one's experience level, their current state of mind, and very importantly, the strength of their pc muscles. Their technique, thrust style, and breathing all play large roles as well, as well as the way that they masturbate and how frequently.      The foreskin is extremely sensitive tissue, and contains thousands and thousands of highly specialized nerve endings, like those in the fingertips and lips - neither your fingertips or your lips, despite feeling amazing when stimulated, make a person ejaculate faster or slower. They just feel good. It's actually deep-pressure nerve endings, primarily found in the glans, that trigger orgasm. But there is SO much more to having a rich, sensory, pleasurable sexual experience than just orgasm. Does circumcision ruin that ability? In most cases no, but it certainly takes away something substantial that many men would not willingly give up.      Another thing that is valuable to the owner of a a foreskin is it's mobility (the way the skin moves back and forth) especially during self-pleasure, this is an invaluable tool.      Hopefully that clears up a bit of the confusion.      Also.. I am curious why someone would get circumcised at age 20. Possibly something that was keeping him from enjoying his foreskin? Could that not have effected his ability to fully appreciate the sensations it provides many men? Just a question.     8:46 PM, December 07, 2010  Boobies said...

We've identified a set of policy principles to govern our policy efforts on Google Shopping in the U.S. These principles are:  1) Google Shopping should provide a positive experience to users. Showing users the right products at the right time can truly enhance a user's experience. When people trust us to deliver them to a destination that's relevant, original, and easy to navigate this creates a positive online experience to the benefit of both users and merchants.  2) Google Shopping should be safe for all users. User safety is everyone's business, and we can't do business with those who don't agree. Scams, phishing, viruses, and other malicious activities on the Internet damage the value of the Internet for everyone. Trying to get around policies or ""game the system"" is unfair to our users, and we can't allow that.  3) Google Shopping should comply with local laws and regulations. Many products and services are regulated by law, which can vary from country to country. All advertising, as well as the products and services being advertised, must clearly comply with all applicable laws and regulations. For the most part, our policies aren't designed to describe every law in every country. All advertisers bear their own responsibility for understanding the laws applicable to their business. Our policies are often more restrictive than the law, because we need to be sure we can offer services that are legal and safe for all users.  4) Google Shopping should be compatible with Google's brand decisions. Google Shopping must be compatible with company brand decisions. Our company has a strong culture and values, and we've chosen not to allow ads that promote products and services that are incompatible with these values. In addition, like all companies, Google sometimes makes decisions based on technical limitations, resource constraints, or requirements from our business partners. Our policies reflect these realities.  We've given much thought to our stance on this content, as well as the potential effect our policy decision could have on our Merchants, and we apologize for any inconvenience this may cause you.  Sincerely,  The Google Shopping Team  © 2012 Google Inc. 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043 You have received this mandatory email service announcement to update you about important changes to your Google Merchant Center account.

SDA omega-3 soybeans offer a sustainable, land-based source of SDA that readily converts to the heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acid found in fish oil. Last year, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a Generally Recognized As Safe notice affirming that the SDA omega-3 soybean oil could be used in a variety of foods. Food companies can now formulate and test the oil from SDA omega-3 soybeans in food products for future launch. Clinical studies have shown that consumption of SDA omega-3 soybean oil significantly raises blood levels of the heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acid EPA, also found in fish and fish oils.""

Oil from Vistive Gold soybeans       will have monounsaturated fat content similar to olive oil and low       saturated fat content like canola oil.

t5_2tnz9,Illuminatesfolly,1341996469,"Perhaps what follows is just a pedantic difference, but you are confusing ""Biological Reason"" with ""Adaptationist Reason"". Everything to do with human behavior and society has a biological explanation (since ""biological explanation"" means nothing other than ""it exists in the world as it is"", a pleonastic tautology in itself). Seldom in evolutionary theory does the *Richard Dawkins®* style adaptationism of the popular Reddit biologist give the full or correct explanation of evolutionary history.   Reddit is prone to giving ""Just-So"" stories of evolution. Where it is true that some part of our early history likely influenced the emergent property that they are describing, it is often the case that the complexity and pure stochastic probabilism of what is being described are ignored outright.   Much of Reddit knows fuck all about Evolutionary theory, and as a genetic engineering student, it is fucking painful, which is why I tend to stay in /r/biology (which also has it's problems) when I am interesting in an evolutionary explanation for a trait.   Evolution is driven by Natural Selection, of course, but it is also confined by ecological interaction, shifted by the drift of random chance and influenced in ways that the human brain just doesn't normally consider, to put it simply. This is why biological scientists that study ecology and evolution apply rigorous statistical treatments of available evidence, to avoid the plausible, but incorrect explanations that we tend to construct in the absence of conflicting evidence.   Always remember, a hypothesis is different than a consistency of suggestion.   **META** I understand the implications of offering ""the human brain doesn't think in particular ways"" as an explanation of why adaptationist reductionism is a bad model for evolutionary theory.

t5_2qm4e,knockingon2043,1342065804,"""Eye drops are used to treat several conditions, including glaucoma, allergies, general redness and dry eyes. Prescription eye drops, of the sort used in the treatment of glaucoma and certain severe allergies, carry explicit instructions on how many to use at a time as well as the total number of eye drops that can be safely used in one day. Similar precautions are included in the packaging of over-the-counter eye drops, such as Clear Eyes® and Visine A.C.® Nevertheless, many people ignore these instructions, using eye drops whenever they feel the slightest discomfort.  Those who have followed the advice of Ben Stein and used eye drops to “get the red out” may be surprised to learn that overuse of these drops can increase eye redness and actually bring about the conditions that they are trying to correct.  Naphazoline, one of the active ingredients in Clear Eyes®, is used in stronger quantities in prescription-only eye drops and treats redness caused by pollen, smog, and other irritants. With overuse, this ingredient can instigate a laundry list of side effects, including dizziness, headache, increased sweating, nausea, weakness, nervousness, decrease in body temperature, and slow heartbeat. The potential side effects from overusing prescription eye drops with other active ingredients are similarly unpleasant, and include vomiting, troubled breathing, and back pain.  Other Possible Side Effects: Dilation of the blood vessels within the eye gives the appearance of redness on the surface of the eye. Common causes of red eyes include extremely dry air, sun exposure, dust, foreign body and an allergic reaction. Derivatives of the medication imidazoline, antihistamines and corticosteroids are ingredients found in over-the-counter eye drops used to relieve eye redness, burning, irritation and dryness caused by exposure to environmental elements.  Rebound Eye Redness: Rebound eye redness is a side effect of overuse of eye drops intended to relieve eye redness. Imidazoline works as a vasoconstrictor, causing the narrowing of blood vessels. Over-the-counter eye drops work quickly to reduce redness, but do not eliminate the cause of the redness. Rebound redness results because the blood vessels in the eye dilate as the effects of the medication in the drops wears off. Overuse of eye drops to relieve the symptom without correcting the cause sets up a cycle of dependency and misuse. Eye drops should be used only as directed, and are not intended for long-term use. According to MayoClinic.com, when over used, eye drops containing imidazoline can cause permanent redness and damage to the blood vessels in the eye.   Eye Irritation: Some brands of eye drops contain an antihistamine in addition to imidazoline. An antihistamine blocks histamine, a chemical released by the immune system in response to an allergic reaction. Histamine dilates blood vessels. Eye drops containing both an antihistamine and any derivative of imidazoline will relieve redness by constricting blood vessels. MayoClinic.com warns that eye irritation is a side effect of this type of eye drops. Symptoms include watery eyes, headache, and a mild stinging or burning of the eyes. Eye inflammation is a risk for users who wear contact lenses.   Eye Infections: Eye drops that contain a corticosteroid work to reduce inflammation associated with an allergic response, radiation or foreign object. This type of prescription eye drop is intended for short-term use. If symptoms are not relieved in two days, the patient needs to be reevaluated by the physician. According to Drugs.com, bacterial, fungal and viral infections of the cornea are associated with prolonged use of eye drops containing steroids. Prolonged use suppresses the immune system’s normal defensive response and increases the risk of eye infections.  As it turns out, even something as seemingly benign as eye drops can be harmful if overused. The key is everything in moderation! Don’t use eyes drops more than you need to!""

It was common knowledge that the sun rotated around the earth, until it was proved that it didn't. We based that change on evidence that can be recreated and verified.  No, fact is something observed, and something able to be reobserved if the condition that lead to the observation can be re-created.  So indeed something can be ... *fact*. Objective fact. According to the second paragraph.  &gt; Now doesn't that sound absurd? Your argument that Atheists have better judgement because it's based on fact is invalid. You have a different judgement that you cannot say is right nor wrong from that of a Theist, who does in fact have the same level of judgement as an Atheist.  I can say my judgement is correct until a fact forces me to change my opinion on the matter. A religious person can do so too. But when they have invoked the ""lords will"" into the matter, I have yet to observe they do.  You seem like a nice person, so I would like to think, that I might be able to change your mind with facts.   And sleep tight!",8169,4,0,0,1,1,©

t5_2qh03,quebecsol22,1342116415,"I tried all these games:  **Might &amp; Magic® Heroes VI** - A very disappointing game. Still too expensive. Nothing like Heroes of Might and magic III. **Don't buy.** I could barely go after the first 3 missions because I was very bored. Notice how they put the ""heroes"" are the end. Totally different feel, I feel the management of armies is so different. However, it's still a decent game, just not worth the price.  **Portal 2** Absolute must! **BUY!** Do not even question it - BUY. If you ever played a video game at any point in your life, BUY.  **Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 3** Despite reddit's hate for call of duty, this a solid game, single player was very good. I feel I got my money's worth. **BUY if you like shooters**, otherwise pass. YES, it's basically MW2 again, but MW2 was a very good game. I paid $60 for it, I just did the campaign and I feel it was worth it.  **Crusader Kings II** - I'm not really in Civilisation/Europea Universalis.­ **If you are, must BUY.** Very well-rated as well, I played this one very little, and my feeling is that it's a tiny bit too expensive still. However, critics are good, and I can definitely see the interest in this gameé  **Legend Of Grimrock** - If you have any interest for RPG at all this is a MUST BUY. Hardcore dungeon crawler! Look at the screenshots, if you absolutely hate dungeons, do not get it. Very good graphics for an indie game. I feel this is the most underestimated game on the list. I don't regret the $20 I paid for this game at all. Puzzles are clever, etc.  **Total War Shogun 2** Very fine strategy games, one of the top games of 2011. **BUY.** This is one of the games I enjoyed the most. Obviously, it's samurai-era, with large scale battles. It might be compared to Mount and Blade in some ways, althought it's in my mind much more developed and clear. If you ever liked Starcraft, Age of Empires, buy this one without even thinking about it.  **Terraria** at $2.49 you can't go wrong. **BUY.** I won't even describe what it is and frankly you can buy this one eyes closed.  **Deus Ex: Human Revolution** Very solid shooter. **BUY.** Honestly, if you have any interest in shooters at all, this is the game to buy.  **Spacechem** - Kinda puzzle game, very well rated but I personally don't like it. Watch videos before you buy. Some people say it's the best game they ever played. **WATCH VIDEOS BEFORE YOU BUY**  **Mafia II** - Similar to GTA but in the 50s. **At this price, BUY.** I might even buy it again (I own it on PS3). If you liked games such as L.A. Noire, this is very similar (less the detective stuff)  **Rayman Origins** - If you have any interest for platform this is a **MUST BUY.** I am not a fan of Rayman personally, but if you ever liked any Rayman game, you can buy this game with eyes closed. With an average score of 86, it's rated almost as well as Diablo 3 (not an example, I know :P).  Verdict: An extremely solid first day with tons of great games. Your wallet is about to take a hit. But then again for the price of a new game ($59) you can easily get 400-500 hours of entertainment.  EDIT: More details added",1650,1,0,0,1,1,®

Obama has never worked for the private sector in any major way, and has spent his entire life cloistered in the backstabbing fantasy-land of academia. As the psychologist Donald Norman said, ""Academics get paid for being clever, not for being right."" Obama has a lot of clever ideas, but how many of them have been right?   - In the 1990s, Mitt Romney shut down the Boston headquarters of Bain Capital for several days after the teenaged daughter of one of his co-workers went missing. The Bain bigwigs gave up millions in profits to relocate to NYC and work full-time on finding the girl. When has Obama done anything similar?   - As governor of Mass, Mitt Romney cut over $1.5 billion from the state's deficit. The state had a budget surplus at the end of his term.   - Under Romney's policies as governor, unemployment in Mass. dropped by several percentage points.   - Romney and the Mass legislature passed a new law giving free in-state tuition to the top 25% of graduating high school students.   - Romney and the Mass legislature passed a law giving free tuition to military personnel returning from active combat duty, and he appointed the state's first-ever head of veteran affairs to the state cabinet.   - Romney signed a bill giving substantial public funds to the construction of low-cost housing.   - Romney had the balls to call out Obama's failure to address the rising unemployment of blacks in his speech to the NAAPC.    **edit**  Obama has taken more campaign money from Bain Capital personnel than Mitt Romney has: http://rt.com/usa/news/obama-wall-street-financial-319/ ",-4,1,0,0,1,1,®

t5_2snuc,cabbagery,1342145289,"It was done in a basic text editor (gedit), not any special logic software (though evidently there are several proof assistants available -- I may give some of them a try). I use Linux (Mint 11, presently), which includes a feature called the ""compose key,"" which is basically a super-intuitive version of the Windows alt-key combinations for special characters. If you want a special character, you simply type your compose key, then type the characters which, when combined, would produce the special character:  * ü = [compose key] + 'u' + ' "" ' * ç = [compose key] + 'c' + ' , ' * £ = [compose key] + 'L' + '-' * ® = [compose key] + 'o' + 'r' * → = [compose key] + '-' + '&gt;'  The standard list of compose key combinations doesn't include the biconditional or the quantifiers (nor does it include modal operators, which I also use), but I can either customize the list (which I have done in the past), or locate them in the character map and save them in a text file for easy access (which is what I currently do).  When I write out a proof, I usually use some shorthand notation in a text editor (nothing fancy) until I see that the proof is going somewhere, after which point I'll copy the list of special characters to the clipboard and shore it up formally. Sometimes I even include dependencies (usually only when the proof is complicated enough to warrant it), and I use a mixture of traditional notation and Graeme Forbes' notation (which is probably not **his**, *per se*, but I learned it from him, so he gets the credit).",24683,785,0,0,1,1,®

And her Noxious Blast animation is really ugly. we agree that her current particles could use some love, so in addition to the changes unique to exalted cassi we're planning on implementing some particle changes across all of her skins (similar to what we did with singed recently). none of her particle changes are on pbe, if i'm not mistaken--only the new model is in the pbe build at this time.  On a personal note, i've been waiting a really long time for a new cassi skin and i'm really happy with how this skin turned out. she's gorgeous! ♥  &gt;Foxfire Ahri is actually a pretty well made skin, albeit, the particle changes are subtle. I'm not sure if she has full particle changes or if the red just provides a greater contrast with blue, but it genuinely feels like all of her particles, from her auto attacks, to the red flames on W and R are smoother.  Yup! her attack particle, orb, and the trail/effect when she throws the orb are all different as you mentioned.   &gt;Wait, so does this mean all her particles on each skin is getting an overhaul like Singed and Exalted Cass won't have unique particles and animations from the other skins?  Yes, it means the particles on her other skins would be updated. exalted cassi won't have the exact same particle effects, but for the most part she'll use the new effects we intend to apply to all of her skins.  thematically, the effects are still poison, and we thought it would be weird if the exalted skin was known as 'the one with the better looking poison' (which isn't something that you would expect if you were comparing splash images). again, it's similar to the augmented singed scenario last patch.  &gt;Is it intended that Riot Singed will use the old particle effect  intended. he'll retain his unique effect/color.",2000,1047,1,0,1,1,♥

t5_2qh03,quebecsol22,1342200203,"**Spellforce Platinum Edition** I liked this game. Graphics are a tiny bit outdated. In my mind, if you want this game, get the 2 for just like $3 more. **DON'T BUY**  **Spellforce 2** A GREAT rpg with good graphics, plus one expansion for free - if you have interest for rpg you must **BUY** especially given the low price. You might not have heard of spellforce a lot; the game is great, well worth the money (also 80 on metacritic!).   **SpellForce 2: Faith in Destiny** IMO the rebate is not great enough to justify an immediate buy... Play the original game first. It should be enough. **DONT BUY**. This ""expansion"" is also fine (don't me wrong, by no means a bad game) but spellforce 2 is better.  It should be noted that like mass effect, spellforce continue the same story. You might want to get spellforce 1 just to get continuity, but my personal recommendation is to get spellforce 2 and just play it :)  **DARKSIDERS** One of the games I enjoyed the most. Very good graphics. Very fun to play. Action game, playing in a demonic invastion. **MUST BUY**  **Sanctum** I did not like this indie game. Felt empty. I had more fun with Super meat boy, trine, journey or such. Personally would not get it, but am not a fan of tower defense. At $2.50 it's a BUY but this is one of these games in your library you might never play. **DONT BUY**  **Hoard** Very fun game for a few hours. You are a dragon. Instead of always building a town and defending, you now attack! I liked the game, and it's really really cheap, but I would still recommend **DONT BUY** given all the games available.  **Super Street Fighter IV** One of the best fighting games ever. Tons of tournaments of it. Obviously you buy this one for multiplayer. Amazing deal. **BUY if you like fighting games**  **Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter® 2** This is the hardest game for me to rate. At $2.49 it's a **BUY** but realize this is a very strategic game - nothing like call of duty modern warfare 3. Its multiplayer is also quite dead, although there are still people playing it. It's a good deal for a very fine game.  **From Dust** An open world game. I really hated this game. It's very different from anything you've played: you use power to freeze rivers and have ""tribals"" pass over it, you move sand and earth, etc. Overall one of the games who disappointed me the most. **DONT BUY**  **The bindings of Isaac** Another indie game, at $1.24 don't even ask the question and **BUY** it.  **Anno 2070** I want to recommend not buying this game just because of the shitty DRM, but I do believe they changed it. Look at the amazing screenshots: this is similar to Sim City, although at the same time very different.  A gorgeous, very fun game, **BUY if you like sim city**.  **Tribes: Ascend - Steam Starter Pack** Beware! Tribes: Ascend is free to play. For $4.99, you get 50% bonus XP forever, bonus weapons, more chars, more perks and more gold. **Play the free game first, if you like it, buy it**.  **Sonic: generation** They say there hasn't been a decent sonic game since the gamegear. This one is good, not great. Very colorful, very fast, and none of the weaknesses of the previous entries in the sery. I do feel it's a tiny bit too expensive so I am going to recommend **DONT BUY** unless you're a Sonic fan.  **Max Payne 3** One of the best games I've played this year at an attractive 50% rebate. **BUY**  **Payday: the heist** This is not a bad game, but it's also one of these games that will sit in your library forever. Kinda repetitive. I played this one for a few hours, and the price is definitely attractive, but I'mma going to recommend **DONT BUY**",1650,1,0,0,1,1,®

La banda se encuentra de gira por EEUU. El músico había alquilado una moto para hacer un trayecto largo y tuvo un accidente del que se desconocen cómo fueron las causas.  El golpe en la cabeza que sufrió obligó a que sea asistido en el CTI de un hospital de Nueva Jersey, por lo que el grupo decidió suspender la presentación que iban a tener en Nueva York.  El jueves por la noche, la banda informó en sus redes sociales que “Curuchet tuvo un accidente en New York”, y que su estado era “reservado”.  Este viernes por la mañana NTVG comunicó que la situación era “delicada”. “Queremos agradecer a todos quienes se preocupan por la salud de Marcel. La situación en estos momentos es delicada. Lo que debemos hacer ahora es estar juntos y mandarle la energía más positiva posible”, informó la banda este viernes por la mañana en sus redes sociales.  No Te Va Gustar se encuentra de gira por México y EEUU, donde presenta su último disco “Público”.

t5_2qhak,mvlazysusan,1342299134,"Nice user name! Do think their is any mysticism in politics?   Would you forgive me if I post here some copy-pasta if it has to do with occult stuff?  ---   I'm gonna describe someone, and you stop me when you know who he is and why it's important...  He was a Brigadier General and a States Attorney General.  In the war with Mexico he fought a pistol duel with his commanding officer.  He manged to kill thousands of Indians by hurling them against Lincolns' army, after he won the battle he manged to lose all his gains in the counterattack. (He was Americas chief Indian negotiator. his actions killed more Indians than any man that ever lived.)  He's the only confederate officer to be pardoned after the Civil War.  He's the only confederate officer to have an outdoor statue of himself in Washington DC. (At the foot of ""judiciary Hill"".)  His body lies behind/**under glass in a topless pyramid they call a ""Temple""** on 16th st. in down town Washington DC. (Google-earth: 38°54'49.28"" N 77°02'09.20"" W) *(You couldn't make this stiff up!)*      Is that kind of spooky? 16th St. is in the center of DC and would run through the oval office if it kept going.   Henry Kissinger recently republished 8 of his books. (Henry Kissinger will headline an event for Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney later this month in Connecticut)  I could go on, but maybe you get the point.  What I'm getting at, is, this dude is not exactly a ""nobody"".  150 years ago he devised a plan for WW1 and it happened exactly as he suggested it should right down to the last detail. He also planed WW2 and it happened exactly as he had planed. He also planed WW3... Are you beginning to get the picture?  His name is Albert Pike. Google ""Albert Pike, 3 world wars"" and LOL at the Ashkenazi (Converts to ""Jew"") Jews, and why they are being allowed to act as the they have. (When he talks about ""a new religion"" that is code for ""science"".) See: [Ask.com:Lucifer-defined](http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20101012155338AAXt25a)       Please see that ""Ask"" link, it's of utmost importance!  TL;DR: The war must be conducted in such a way that Islam (the Moslem Arabic World) and political Zionism (the State of Israel) **mutually destroy each other**. *(Keep in mind, Persia (Iran) is not ""Arabic"" in language or geography., and has the largest population of NON-European (real) Jews than any other nation on earth.http://www.sephardicstudies.org/iran.html)* *Hitler suggested Persia change it's name to Iran which means ""Land of the Aryan"" and considered them full blooded Aryans. See: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP38kyQukWY*  Q: If you had not one racist bone in your body, what would a ""race"" have to do to you, for you to want to kill that ""race""?  A: What ever your answer... TKS! That is exactly what they need to do to get this ball rolling!  From: http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/khazars1.asp (That's from Fordham University)   In the year 740 AD there were a few Israelites and the king and subjects of a huge powerful kingdom was to convert to one of three religions en-mass, and were tricked into not converting to ""Israelites"" but converting to ""Jews"" (Notice how the king was corrected about the difference by the Christin):  &gt;On the third day he called all the sages together and said to them. ""Speak and argue with one another and make clear to me which is the best religion."" They began to dispute with one another without arriving at any results until the King said to the Christian priest ""What do you think? Of the religion of the Jews and the Muslims, which is to be preferred?"" The priest answered: ""The religion of the Israelites is better than that of the Muslims.""   &gt;The King then asked the kadi [a Muslim judge and scholar]: ""What do you say? Is the religion of the Israelites, or that of the Christians preferable?"" The kadi answered: ""The religion of the Israelites is preferable.""   &gt;Upon this the King said: ""If this is so, you both have admitted with your own mouths that the religion of the Israelites is better Wherefore, trusting in the mercies of God and the power of the Almighty, I choose the religion of Israel, that is, the religion of Abraham.  But they still even today use their Babylonian Talmud.  And so that brings me to this: Revelation 2:9. I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou art rich) and I know the blasphemy of them which *say they are Jews, and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan.*       Please remember Satan and Lucifer are not the same thing.  (What would Jebus do?)  Now here is a nifty little blood test that can tell the difference: http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Health/genetics.html (Notice how they specify Ashknazi European ""Jews"")  ---   Sorry for spamming you. What I'm trying to say is Israel is a tool to get rid of Christian, Jew, Muslim, and replace them with ""science"". At least that's the way I see it ATM.

Hannas's background is more as a linguist in the sense of speaking a bunch of languages rather than theoretical, so I would be curious for some academic linguists' impressions on his book. i found it informative (although it clearly had an axe to grind if I recall, for better or worse).  @guohuade i would say it is not productive to focus on the computer example. whoever said it was a bad thing to create a transparent and easy to say compound like diannao? calquing is easier for native speakers, loan words are easier for foreign learners. who is to say what is better in principle?  @CRCulver, would you concede that there are gradations in terms of how phonotactically disallowed various strings are that an alphabet could exploit? For instance, I have a lot of trouble reliably producing a word-final h but I can produce a word initial ts just fine.

That banker that turned in the gold teeth named Rudolf Puhl was a Jew. The numbers tattooed on people were processed by IBM computers managed out of New York, if the number started with a 0 you were a Gypsy if it started with a 1 you were Armenian if it started with a 6 you were a Jew.    The only resion the Japs were in  Korea is becouse **we told them to** before WW1 when *they were our allies*.  &gt;Korea was occupied and declared a Imperial Japanese protectorate in the 1905 Eulsa Treaty, and officially annexed in 1910 through the annexation treaty.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korea_under_Japanese_rule   Again, sorry for the downvote, sorrier still for the state of government education. *(both Japanese and American.)*   Have a nice day ♥",11802,28824,0,0,1,1,♥

From the way it ended it seemed like something may be possible. Please correct me if I am wrong or help give me a better understanding of things. It just needed time no need to rush into anything or get overly excited about anything. It was exciting though. BtrLatethenNvr is finally having things go his way. The following morning(This would be Friday the 13th i am referring to) i texted her in regards to her birthday and what she wanted to do. i told her that if i didn't go to the hospital again after a mountain biking session or have any other serious injuries that we would go out. I ask her if she wants to go out or stay in pretty much whatever it is her day its her choice. Later in the day she is out and about shopping and I ask if i can accompany her if i make it back in time to do some shopping myself ""Behind Every Well-Dressed Man Is a Woman of Taste"" like to follow that if and when i can. I was a couple states away. She is out but says we will go shopping for ME on HER birthday. Little ridiculous and i insist we do something else. She sends me a photo of herself. I pay her compliment with saying she looks nice and that cute girls never send me pics blah blah blah. she says her phone is dying and she will text me later. I do indeed get a text from her later and i ask her about her shopping. She tell me how she didn't get anything and indulged herself in some pinkberry. When i took her out for ice cream i think in either my original or 2nd post i had offered to take her here cause i had never been and she denied. I asked her regarding this and she said that she would have felt bad. I ask her again about her birthday and she says we are shopping. Fine we can go shopping but for her not me. Its you birthday enjoy it thats how i see it. So i try to play it off in the sense that we can go an do what i want but then go and do something. I ask her plans again and when to get her. Not when and where just WHEN. She doesn't really reply back and i jokingly threaten her that i will stop talking to her if she doesn't allow me to do anything for her. She says i won't and i say that somebody is a little confident, that i might stop talking to her and what makes her think i won't.   The midnight hour is approaching. I am back from a day long mountain biking trip, I haven't been out seriously biking for two years. I met the ground several times that day along with a tree or two. I was sore to say the least but i made a note to draw a picture for the girl using the Crayola Crayon color that she loves and surprisingly enough was my favorite growing up that says happy birthday. I send it to her and Midnight on the dot and tell her to let me know about tomorrow. I don't get a immediate reply back but i do get a ""aww. i love it. then a couple minutes later followed by ""Aww i think you fell asleep sweet dreams"" So i go to work the next day and when i get out which is a good hour and a half to an hour before the time of six she said to get her i ask her is she still wants to go out. No reply. WTF all the previous nights of talking of you telling me your boyfriend forgot about your birthday and that you parents did too and its been shitty and that you want to make something work or something and you blow me fucking off. You have told me you have the whole weekend off. I have the unfortunate circumstance to find out that you did infact have some sort of either surprise plan or intended plan for Saturday after i have asked you to give me some of your time for me to do something for you. I am looking at your facebook profile which i haven't done in some time and i find out that you were at the beach on friday no boyfriend though. two days earlier he came to work with roses and food for you. You have pictures posted and you have admitted to others along with me that you HATE ROSES. When i sent you that picture at midnight you were on the phone with either you bestfriend at the time or you boyfriend. You thank all your friends and family and your ""Wonderful boyfriend"" for your birthday. Then today you are out with your family and ""hopefully spending time with my wonderful boyfriend ♥""            ",62,3,0,0,0,1,♥

t5_2qh55,djeclipz,1342420212,"Recipe:  The king of the Q in these parts is clearly Rockin Ronnie Shewchuk. His newest book, ""Planking Secrets"" by Whitecap Books is the bible to planking. Here is one of my favourite recipes from one of his many…  1 cedar cooking plank, soaked overnight or at least for 1 hour ½ cup Jack Daniels Whiskey 1 cup real maple syrup 1 tsp crushed hot red chilies 1 Tbsp butter at room temp 1 whole boned fillet wild Pacific salmon (3 pounds, skin on) kosher salt and fresh ground black pepper 1 tsp granulated onion or onion powder 2 lemons halved parsley sprigs for garnish 1 Tbsp finely chopped flat leaf Italian parsley For the sauce, combine the whiskey and maple syrup. Ina small saucepan, bring the mixture to a low boil and reduce by half. The mixture should coat the back of a spoon. Add the chilies and butter, stir, set aside and keep warm.   Season the skinless side of the salmon with salt, pepper and onion. Let the salmon sit for 10-15 minutes at room temperature until the rub is moistened.   While the salmon is sitting, preheat the grill on medium high for 5-10 minutes or until the chamber temperature rises above 500F. Rinse the plank and place it on the cooking grate. Cover the grill and heat the plank for 4-5 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium low. Season the plank with kosher salt and place the salmon skin side down on the plank.   Cover the grill and cook for 15 - 20 minutes or until the fish has an internal temperature of 135F. Check periodically to make sure the plank doesn't catch fire. Spray the burning edges with water if it does, making sure to close the lid afterwards.   When the salmon is done, squeeze half a lemon along its length and carefully transfer to a platter. Garnish with parsley sprigs and the remaining lemon cut into slices. Bring the salmon to the table. Drizzle a spoonful of the sauce over each portion as you serve and sprinkle with the chopped parsley.

t5_2r9po,ghirkin,1342462206,"I have only ever had this problem once. I was attempting to run TexMod with an older build and got the exact same error.   I will assume you are not using TexMod, or anything else which could possibly interfere with the way Direct3D draws textures. (I would advise disabling any 'in-game overlay' type software that you have installed. And have tried running gw2.exe as admin if on Vista or higher.  First thing to always try is *reboot* I know that being told to ''turn it off and on again.'' can be tiresome but it does sometimes fix these things.  If a reboot does not sort it:  The first two steps are to make sure you have the most recent version of DirectX 9.0c installed, to do that run the [DirectX End-User Runtime Web Installer](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35) from Microsoft.  The next step is to update your integrated video card's drivers, the easiest way to do this is to run the [Intel® Driver Update Utility](http://www.intel.com/p/en_US/support/detect?iid=dc_iduu) as it will automatically find the right driver for your hardware. Please note that you are installing graphics drivers, the tool may suggest to install other Intel drivers which you can ignore for now.  If neither of the above work, and you need to get the game to patch, you can use the Non-DirectX rendered launcher. To to this create a shortcut to gw2.exe and append -useoldlauncher to the target field. The properties window should look something like [this](http://i.imgur.com/O6RKc.png). Click Ok to save the settings and run gw2.exe from the shortcut. You will notice it uses a different launcher, and upon downloading all the files the game will start. It is possible with this being a DirectX-related issue (by the looks of it) that the game will crash at this point, however should a fix become available you will have all the files required to play.

t5_2qh36,Ywen,1342468250,"I might have a couple of comments with respect to the foundness of the ""OMG WTF IT HAZ NO PROOFS U BIG n00b!!"" rant:  First, what does actually prevent ClassyPrelude from coming with a set of QuickCheck properties? It's weaker than proofs in the Coq/Agda sense (if that's what you mean), but that would be awesome for new collections developers, who would already have their work done regarding the properties testing.  And second, why don't you apply the same rant to, well... every typeclass available on Hackage? And in package 'base' (incidentally our already existing core) to start with? Because now, it appears you don't only condemn ClassyPrelude but the whole typeclass system. (And you would not do that without a complete blog post on the subject due to the ghastly specter of the baseless-assertion which as a Sword of Damocles now impends over you, would you?)  To speak frankly, I've always been quite uncomfortable, after giving a screed about the might and wonders of what Haskell has to propose wrt code generalization to the good-but-yet-to-be-enlightened-and-raptured-to-higher-heavens® common Java folk, at the thought of telling them ""well... yeah... to get the size of a List it's 'length', but for a Set or a Map it's not the same function, it's 'size'. Oh, and also we don't have a standard collection generalization [1]"".  [1] Okay we have Foldable/Traversable but it's weaker in the sense it generalizes less.

t5_2qm4e,djimbob,1342470889,"My point for bringing up Kerckhoff's was not to criticize passphrases (random high-entropy passphrases are great), but to criticize cheap attempts at security that don't intrinsically rely on many random choices.  I don't mind people knowing I use a nine word diceware passphrase for my encryption key (80 bits of entropy); that knowledge will not in any real way help you break it as there are more than 10^35 possibilities if you knew the exact dictionary I used and assume I made no modifications.  (A hundred million computers trying a billion passphrases from the right dictionary per second would take more than 30 billion years to crack it).  Good: `octopus fire jogging milk pi softly`.  Bad:  `I♥reddit` for my reddit password (I mean what brute forcer will try unicode characters) even though I♥ is fairly low entropy + name of site?  An attacker getting one of your passwords (say admin recorded passwords in plaintext) can then figure out almost all of them very quickly (and you also have to beware of the application possibly silently stripping unicode characters from your password, at which point it becomes `Ireddit`).  Or a scheme like I repeat the same word three times with `!`/`@`/`#` instead of vowels in the first/second/third word for `R!dd!tR@dd@tR#dd#t`.  Or use the word reddittidder with my hands shifted up and to the left while typing for `54rr9669rr45`.  Stupid schemes have weak security that can get figured out.",113108,1929,0,0,1,1,♥

t5_2qpzs,StupidityInSequence,1342530555,"Personally, I don't look for any sort of meaning, or relevance or belonging in this world. Why do we need a meaning to exist? That's the beautiful thing about life. As far as I'm concerned, we've just randomed into this wonderful soup of elements and atoms in what I believe to be quite a lovely part of the universe just to... be. Near everybody I know, when talking on this subject wants there to be a meaning to their lives, and thos that are religious want meaning so they can feel love and adoration from their chosen God(s). But not needing to find meaning in life takes a huge weight off. You're not spending everyday of your life  trying to make someone love you with no return.   In short, I would say to abandon a  search for meaning, never tell yourself that it was fate that something did or didn't happen and do things without regret. You have nothing to prove to anyone anymore. You're beautiful. Understand life for the glorious chaos that it is, love others and you will quickly be loved back. You can find someone to share this journey with. Heck, I think you've already found 15 or so people here to share this journey with and start you on your way. ♥",22,1,0,0,1,1,♥

t5_2r4kq,ThereIsNoJustice,1342541767,"In practical terms, you can make the conversation as short as possible, but in terms of perspective, it's important to understand that no one can make you suffer. Another person can make you hear something, see something, and generally effect your senses. But whether you decide this is unacceptable/wrong/problematic is up to you.   Then people want to know how to take that view. I just finished reading a buddhist book (Sit Down and Shut Up) by Brad Warner which has a great story, which shows the difficulty in this:  &gt;A few hundred years ago a dude named Gensa, who later went on to be one of the great Buddhist teachers, was still a young monk. One day he gets fed up with the temple where he’s studying. He figures he’d be better off getting out and seeing what the rest of the world has to offer. Maybe another temple will have whatever it is he’s been looking for. Or maybe he’ll just give up on temples altogether. As he’s heading out the gate, he stubs his toe on a big ol’ rock. He’s hopping around in terrible pain, bleeding from under his toenail, going, “Ow! Ow! Shit! Piss! Damn!” And he thinks, “I’ve heard that the body is an illusion. So where the hell did all this pain come from?” All at once he gets it.  &gt;Later on, his teacher, a guy named Seppo Gisan, asks him what’s up, and he says, “I just can’t be deceived by others.” ...That one sentence, “I can’t be deceived,” says all you need to know.  &gt;When people say stuff like “I can’t be deceived,” the emphasis is usually on “I.” ... But that’s not what Gensa means here. “I” here is absolutely universal. It refers just as much to you and me as it does to Gensa himself. He’s not bragging. He might even be a little bit sad when he says, “I can’t be deceived.”  &gt;You’re probably thinking, Why would he be sad about that? I mean, he’s enlightened, right? And enlightenment is supposed to be the happiest thing that can ever happen to a person — just like Disneyland is the Happiest Place on Earth® — right? Otherwise why strive for it? But think about it for a sec. Imagine a situation in which you suddenly realize with absolute certainty that you can never blame anyone else... You can no longer tell yourself that if only this or that happened, then you’d find perfect happiness... It must be just a little sad. But it’s sad in a different way from usual sadness. It’s a sadness that knows what sadness really is. It knows that there is no merit in taking hold of sadness, so it lets the sadness drift by. Still, it’s not as if sadness isn’t part of the equation.  &gt;The idea that we can be deceived is an illusion created by our amazing ability to think. Real deception never happens. We pretend to be deceived. We even fool ourselves into actually thinking we believe we’ve been had. But it just doesn’t happen. When Gensa stubbed his toe on that rock — in other words, when he suddenly came face-to-face with the undeniable fact that he was living in this world and not in the world he created in his mind — he understood that he could not be deceived.",3477,791,0,0,1,1,®

t5_2r2o9,escielenn,1342577418,"After reading through the books, I was really wanting to play the game of Cyvasse. I decided that creating a Lego version would allow me to have the flexibility to change the gameboard as I play-tested different sets of rules.  First, the rules and design aren't final. My main purpose was to recreate a piece of the books that I really loved and have fun doing it. I'll try to stay spoiler-free in my descriptions below.  My approach was to remain as close to how the game is described in the books. George R. R. Martin doesn't describe the rules to the game and, according to an interview, has no intention of doing so. However, he does give some specific description of the pieces and portions of gameplay. As much as possible, the board was created with those few details in mind.  The game, as I can best surmise, seems a combination of chess, Battleship, and chinese chess. I haven't made a final choice of the ruleset I'm going to use. I'm currently testing it using rules based on the efforts of these sources:  http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Cyvasse http://asoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/topic/58545-complete-cyvasse-rules/  http://skitzinc.wikispaces.com/Cyvasse  http://gameofcyvasse.com/  My current ruleset is most like the ones described here: http://skitzinc.wikispaces.com/Cyvasse.  I've also used his suggestion of board size and expanded the chessboard from and 8x8 to a 10x13 (or 10x12 with a river).  Some information/clarification on what you're seeing in the photos:  **The Wall**  ""as they arranged their tiles on either side of a carved wooden screen."" [ADWD]  I created my board with a screen in the center that can be removed. The screen sets where the river would be (based on the design of chinese chess). My wall was designed to be like the Wall in ASOIAF.  **The Pieces**  ""There were ten different pieces, each with its own attributes and powers,"" [FOC]  I've created ten different pieces.

t5_2qhm7,escielenn,1342578137,"[Potential Spoilers All]  In the books by George R. R. Martin, the characters play a chess-like game called Cyvasse. reading through the books, I was really wanting to play this game.  However, it's not a real game.  No one has made this game.  So, I decided that creating a Lego version would allow me to have the flexibility to change the gameboard as I play-tested different sets of rules.    First, the rules and design aren't final.  My main purpose was to recreate a piece of the books that I really loved and have fun doing it.  I'll try and stay spoiler-free in my descriptions below.  My approach was to stay as close to what is described in the books.  George R. R. Martin doesn't describe the rules to the game and, according to an interview, has no intention of doing so.  However, he does give some specific description of the pieces and portions of gameplay. As much as possible, the board was created with those few details in mind.  The game, as I can best surmise, seems a combination of chess, Battleship, and chinese chess.  I haven't made a final choice of the ruleset I'm going to use.  I'm currently testing it using rules based on the efforts of these sources: http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Cyvasse http://asoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/topic/58545-complete-cyvasse-rules/ http://skitzinc.wikispaces.com/Cyvasse http://gameofcyvasse.com/  My current ruleset is most like the ones described here:  http://skitzinc.wikispaces.com/Cyvasse.

t5_2qo4s,CurLyy,1342621927,"In NY the market is different then you cowboy folks.  None of the real fans go to games because the Garden is expensive as fuck.  We watch them from our couches, curse out our players, and our ownership, then tune in again the next night.  These fans that go to games, its like a social experiment.  NY is the most expensive city in the country, these are the rich folks who only go because its something to do.    Of course there are the season ticket owners who love the team but that's rare.    Anyway, my chime in on this topic is that racism is bad, but blind race pride is bad too.  Half the comments on here are also just Asian folks who never watched basketball before Jlin or Jesus lovers and don't realize the rockets already released him, and think NY is bad for letting him go.  Should be thankful we gave him a chance and D'antoni let him become what he did.  &gt;Congratulations to ~H♥ust♥n R♥cket &amp; J♥r♥my~ Sincerely hope that the new team and a new vision.

I fought Sharpedo with a Lv. 1 Bulbasaur lead and it went up to Lv. 25 after I killed Sharpedo.  ♥ Aside from a rather unfulfilling quest [](/s""to find the Seven Sages (Minus Ghetsis)""), I don't know of much. The end of Black and White was left rather unfinished and it's rustled my jimmies. With luck though Black and White 2 will remedy this problem and add a bunch more content to the game, as it is lacking quite a bit post Elite 4 Round 2. I don't count the Dream World or any of that as part of the game content because you can only access that stuff with a computer.   ♥ As for 4th Gen, I would have to say Pearl and/or Soul Silver. I'd recommend getting both, as it will give you a much broader range of selection when it comes to making a team, as a great deal of Pokemon are unobtainable in the wild otherwise. If you know anyone who can lend you or if you can manage to get a copy of Sapphire or Ruby yourself, that would be even better, as you can transfer Pokemon you can't get on the other games to your 4th Gen via Pal Park and then on to your Black/White from there.  Home this helped you out, feel free to ask if you need or want to know anything else.",213,15,0,0,0,1,♥

t5_2qqjc,daleadil,1342749240,"###Chapter 4  **A**t a certain point, Nicholas White ran out of ideas. Anger and vindictiveness took root. He began to think, They, whoever they were, shouldn’t be able to get away with this, that he deserved some compensation for the ordeal. He cast about for blame. He wondered where his colleague was, why she hadn’t been alarmed enough by his failure to return, jacketless, from smoking a cigarette to call security. Whose fault is this? he wondered. Who’s going to pay? He decided that there was no way he was going to work the following week. And then he gave up.   The time passed in a kind of degraded fever dream. On the videotape, he lies motionless for hours at a time, face down on the floor.  A voice woke him up: “Is there someone in there?”  “Yes.”  “What are you doing in there?”  White tried to explain; the voice in the intercom seemed to assume that he was an intruder. “Get me the fuck out of here!” White shrieked. Duly persuaded, the guard asked him if he wanted anything. White, who had been planning to join a few friends at a bar on Friday evening, asked for a beer.  Before long, an elevator-maintenance team arrived and, over the intercom, coached him through a set of maneuvers with the buttons. White asked what day it was, and, when they told him it was Sunday at 4 P.M., he was shocked. He had been trapped for forty-one hours. He felt a change in the breeze, which suggested that the elevator was moving. When he felt it slow again, he wrenched the door open, and there was the lobby. In his memory, he had to climb up onto the landing, but the video does not corroborate this. When he emerged from the elevator, he saw his friends, with a couple of security guards, and a maintenance man, waiting, with an empty chair. His friends turned to see him and were appalled at the sight; he looked like a ghost, one of them said later. The security guard handed him an open Heineken. He took one sip but found the beer repellent, like Hans Castorp with his Maria Mancini cigar. White told a guard, “Somebody could’ve died in there.”  “I know,” the guard said.  White had to go upstairs to get his jacket. He demanded that the guards come with him, and so they rode together on the service elevator, with the elevator operator. The presence of others with radios put him at ease. In his office he found that his co-worker, in a fit of pique over his disappearance, had written an angry screed, and taped it to his computer screen, for all their colleagues to see. He went home, and then headed to a bar. He woke up to a reel of phone messages and a horde of reporters colonizing his stoop. He barely left his apartment in the ensuing days, deputizing his friends to talk to reporters through a crack in the door.  White never went back to work at the magazine. Caught up in media attention (which he shunned but thrilled to), prodded by friends, and perhaps provoked by overly solicitous overtures from McGraw-Hill, White fell under the sway of renown and grievance, and then that of the legal establishment. He got a lawyer, and came to believe that returning to work might signal a degree of mental fitness detrimental to litigation. Instead, he spent eight weeks in Anguilla. Eventually, Business Week had to let him go. The lawsuit he filed, for twenty-five million dollars, against the building’s management and the elevator-maintenance company, took four years. They settled for an amount that White is not allowed to disclose, but he will not contest that it was a low number, hardly six figures. He never learned why the elevator stopped; there was talk of a power dip, but nothing definite. Meanwhile, White no longer had his job, which he’d held for fifteen years, and lost all contact with his former colleagues. He lost his apartment, spent all his money, and searched, mostly in vain, for paying work. He is currently unemployed.  Looking back on the experience now, with a peculiarly melancholic kind of bewilderment, he recognizes that he walked onto an elevator one night, with his life in one kind of shape, and emerged from it with his life in another. Still, he now sees that it wasn’t so much the elevator that changed him as his reaction to it. He has come to terms with the trauma of the experience but not with his decision to pursue a lawsuit instead of returning to work. If anything, it prolonged the entrapment. He won’t blame the elevator. ♦   Read more http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/04/21/080421fa_fact_paumgarten#ixzz217gYM7X6",3668,7938,0,0,1,1,♦

t5_2qh0u,MerlinsBeard,1342803119,"Honestly? Yes, it does. The Brits love to depreciate themselves but they also relish depreciating everyone around them because that's just how they are. Most redditors from the US are counter-culture (and thus, hate McDonalds/SUVs/Pop Culture/other ""American icons"") are also pretty depreciative of the US as they feel it's shameful to have any pride in one's nation. [Comments like this are perfect examples](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/wuzka/my_dads_classic_mini_cooper_parker_between_two/c5gsbqw) of the prevailing sentiment on reddit about Americans. We're all scooter/SUV riding fatasses that are toting 5 guns and sipping on a MtDew while eating a fried chicken cheeseburger. No, really, I'm posting this from my Hoveround®.  I drive an SUV. I have countless uses for it and purposely chose one with a good efficiency but powerful 6-cylinder. I don't need an 8-cylinder as my 6cyl can tow around 2 tons without problems and still gets on average 19mpg with mostly city driving. I use it to haul around a plethora of things as well as the utility of being able to collapse all 5 of my back seats so my dogs have romping room on long trips (i.e. trips over 250mi/400km).   Of course you'll always have some asshole in a huge truck that bought it just because but most people see great utility in a truck/SUV. It has more to do with the rigid sense of independence that I honestly think (not a slight) that a lot of foreigners don't understand about Americans. We will, god dammit, do whatever we need to do without an ounce of help from anyone else.  At least in the US South you're looked down on if you can't do at least basic maintenance of your vehicle/home/property. You look like an asshole (not saying it's justified... that's just the way it is) if you order a replacement toilet/sink/etc and require it to be shipped to your house instead of packing it in your car.   TL;DR Most Americans are self-reliant and this is reflected with a vehicle that grants a large amount of utility and independence.",84823,1005,0,0,1,1,®

t5_2qh2p,Tachyx,1342814920,"&gt;Why are you doing that? Neither word is capitalized nor are they registered trademarks.  I'm trying to distinguish between these two words which have distinct definitions, but people also use them to identify themselves and groups. For example, by definition I am an agnostic, but I never identify myself as Agnostic® because I am not part of that group of people who do, and I would consider that dishonest.  &gt;Not all agnostic individuals have a religion.  This is irrelevant. The reason people identify as Agnostics® is because they are afraid of offending powerful people. Atheists aren't powerful. People who refuse to choose a political party because ""both sides are bad"" are the same sort as Agnostics®. People will continue to be ""bad"" if so many of you don't want to get involved. It leaves Atheists® to carry a heavier burden and its why I don't respect Agnostics® and don't wish to be associated with them, but I am still an agnostic. How can I make these words different?  &gt;I doubt theists who might identify as agnostic in some sense are always offended.  People who get ""offended"" choose to do so, and they choose to do so because they are deeply committed to their religion. Self-identified Agnostics® are deeply committed to try desperately to NOT offend anyone, especially anyone with power. The problem is that people don't get offended by accident, it's a choice, and nothing you do can prevent it. Clearly, committed Christians and agnostics of any variety are totally separate groups.  &gt;I contend that ""unattached agnosticism"" isn't really a defensible stance, and amounts to ""I don't know what it is I believe and do not believe."" It's more of a stance of confusion, or transition.  While both of those are true, the reality is most unattached agnostics are just cowards. All religions teach that all other religions are wrong. Choosing ""none-of-the-above"" seems like the safest bet.  Unfortunately, for those who believe ""if you're not with us you're against us"", this counts as not being with us.

t5_2qh2p,thenaterator,1342816189,"&gt;The reason people identify as Agnostics® is because they are afraid of offending powerful people. Atheists aren't powerful.  You're overgeneralizing.  People identify as agnostic for a variety of reasons, including trying to soften their position.  They can also do so to be *clear* about their position, or because they don't *understand* their position, or the implications of it.  &gt; People who refuse to choose a political party because ""both sides are bad"" are the same sort as Agnostics®.  So you're strictly defining ""Agnostics®"" as people who identify as agnostic simply because they think atheists and theists are both wrong.  This is fine, but it's better to call them *confused,* because they clearly have an incomplete understanding of what it means to use the words agnostic, theist, or atheist.  It's ridiculous to equate independently (I assume American) registered voters to the sorts of people who label themselves agnostic to avoid controversy.  People label themselves Independent, again, for a variety of reasons.  Chiefly, I think it is apparent that they do so because no political party accurately represents their views.  &gt;People will continue to be ""bad"" if so many of you don't want to get involved.  Oh, so you're just compounding people who don't register or vote with major parties with people who aren't interested in participating in politics.  That's how it appears, anyway.  &gt;It leaves Atheists® to carry a heavier burden and its why I don't respect Agnostics® and don't wish to be associated with them, but I am still an agnostic. How can I make these words different?  You seem to be asserting that labeling yourself as an atheist automatically puts you in a position to combat theists, and labeling yourself strictly ""agnostic"" removes you from participating.  Neither of those things is true.  you should identify with a term which correctly describes your position, if you feel so compelled to describe yourself as such.  &gt;the reality is most unattached agnostics are just cowards. All religions teach that all other religions are wrong. Choosing ""none-of-the-above"" seems like the safest bet.  No, they aren't necessarily mostly cowards.  Some are afraid, some are confused about their own belief structure, and some simply don't understand that the word atheist and agnostic can both be used to describe their current belief structure.  It's a popular misconception that ""agnostic"" means ""I think there *could* be a god,"" and atheist means ""I hold that belief that no gods exist, and it is impossible for them to exist.""  This is a problem of misinformation, and lack on introspection, not cowardice.",25366,2420,0,0,1,1,®

t5_2qh03,TheMock,1342817010,"My friends and companions are dead. The sight of them lying in a pool of blood of our enemies and their own brings a single tear to my eye. These were my friend. We had grown together. Now I had failed them in their greatest need and I felt like I had betrayed the whole world. As I turned to leave I unconsciously dropped my sword and shield. They made a clanking sound when they hit ground. Thoughts in my head were swirling mess as remember how we used go with Carl to the forest near our birth village to take a sneak peak at girls swimming naked in forest lake. Ah, the wonders of youth. What would I pay to be able to go with Carl and feel that youthful excitement. And Donna. She was my first love. She was from neighboring village. I first met her at a festival in her village. I remember it like yesterday. There was this dancing act where girls from her village danced around  a fire. They were all beautiful, dressed in wonderful garments and they moved their bodies like possessed. I was told it was some fertility rite. I was hypnotized, not by the dancing girls but one girl in the audience looking very sad. She was probably near my age with beautiful blond hair and small nose. My heart twisted as looked that sad girl surrounded by all this joy. I knew I needed to make that girl happy so I used all the money I had saved to use at festival and bought one dragon flower.  The flower in my hand, my heart racing, I approached the girl from behind. As I presented her the flower I said: ""Even with that sorrowful face you are the most beautiful thing I have ever rest my eyes on."" The smile she gave me quaked my knees and shattered my youthful heart. I was hers for all eternity. Later that night I found out that her father had died two days before the festival in a hunting accident.  These and more memories of my companions flooded my head I found some strength to check that the wizard was truly dead. I kicked his face in with the steel toe of my boots. That man was wile criminal who had terrorized these parts of the world for many years. Now he lied dead. But in making him like he was now I had lost much. More than I had hoped. The bounty money was good but the price paid was greater. I took his ring as a proof. Hastily I build a stretcher from a table and lifted the bodies of my friends on it. My friend deserve better than be left to rot in this vile place. I would give them a burial fit for heroes. I have only vague recollections of my journey out from the wizard's lair as only things I could think were the faces of my friends and journeys we took together. As I approached the entrance I felt something hit my leg. Grunting as realized that I had taken an arrow to my knee from a lousy town who had been sent to wait us and report of our success or failure. Nervous bastard I thought as I slumped down.  So... I would like The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion® Game of the Year Edition Deluxe so I could go on adventuring without the fear of my knees being shot.",226,7,0,0,1,1,®

According to [ec.princeton.edu:](http://ec.princeton.edu/questions/bdfect.html)  &gt;In the case of progestin-only pills (like Plan B One-Step, Next Choice One Dose, Next Choice or Levonorgestrel Tablets), these pills contain the same hormones as many daily birth control pills, which a number of studies have found cause no increased risk of birth defects in children born to women who continued to take them because they didn’t realize they were pregnant. As a result, the United States Food and Drug Administration removed warnings about the possibility that oral contraceptives could harm a fetus several years ago. In addition, even if you don’t realize you are pregnant, you would take emergency contraceptive pills long before the organs would start to develop (a process called “organogenesis”), making it extremely unlikely that emergency contraception would lead to birth defects.

Download the first link on the page (titled http://fose.silverlock.org/download/fose_v1_2_beta2.7z) and open it up till you get a list of files. Drag all the files **APART FROM THE FOLDER SRC** into your fallout 3 directory (the one before your data folder). Then use Fallout mod manager to launch the game with the FOSE.   Hope that helps!   Here's the [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wbrTpqa4dI) clip that helped me!

t5_2qnzu,croock3,1342906858,"I agree with a lot with what you've said and I think as this was Bethesda's first fallout game that I would expect there to be faults (give new vegas a try it has a ton more exploring to do and the story is influenced a lot more by you and there are waaaay more side quests to do).   However, I just wanted to say that if you buy the broken steel ad on, when you wake up after the purifier accident, Elder Lions explains to you why you were knocked out, which apparently was some shock blast or something that was emitted when the purifier was turned on and therefore not the radiation which is why it wouldn't matter if you went in Fawkes as the blast also knocked out Sarah Lyons (who was outside the purifier) and I wont spoil any more incase you wanna buy it for yourself :D  Anyway, give New Vegas a shot! Bethesda are getting better with their fallout stories in my opinion and therefore Fallout 4 should be fucking orgasmic to play.  GL HF ♥",1803,1489,0,0,0,1,♥

On our way in from fishing for halibut we noticed a few humpback whales playing in the distance and we stopped part way in to watch. It was quite an experience to see something completely airborne so close to the boat. The lucky thing was I got the photo I submitted. A fellow boat also got a picture of the whale close to mid air and it was also all caught on video. Was an amazing day.

Guess one of my latest Crazy stories, which is more screwed up then crazy... Would be the last time I was suppose to meet a girl for a first date (its been almost a year since then). So it was around 8 at night and The girl and I agreed to meet in front of our workplace at 8:10 and go out to dinner, I don't drive so I walked there and waited until a bit after 10 oclock. She never showed up and my phone had died 5 minutes ago, So I started walking home - disappointed and now distracted.    In about 6 minutes I was halfway home, Just crossed the train tracks and enjoying the night air. Two males had just crossed onto my side of the sidewalk and were approaching me - I didn't pay them any mind because I never had a problem before in my city. As Soon as they were within reach they both attacked me - the one on the right grabbed and broke off my 14carat gold crucifix and dogtags that I kept on a gold necklace that my grandmother had given me before she passed away, Along with lesser items that I gathered from my travels. The one on the left had grabbed just under my neck and had my shirt clutched in hand, I broke his grasp by slamming a fist down and threw a punch at his face that missed when He backed away. He started to run past me, So I threw another punch at the guy on the right which missed when he sprinted away. I ran forward and grabbed a streetpole to swing myself around faster so I could chase after them - it worked for the most part except my boot slipped off the wet edge of the sidewalk and lost my balance. I fell straight to the ground and tried to stop my fall by throwing my left arm out straight to the ground, The fall with my weight ended up breaking my arm's bone right in front of the elbow. Even though it hurt and I couldn't move my arm well now - I still got up and continued chasing the two males that were still within visual range, I ran as fast as I could trying to catch up not knowing what I was going to do with one arm incapacitated, but it didn't matter - I could see a red car pullout of a parking lot and stop right in front of the two males, they got in without hesitation and the vehicle drove off and pass the intersection.     Sorry about the long read guys! Had to get the details in. :) Anyways, good luck everyone.",1977,308,0,0,1,1,®

Parents, curious to know their child's sex, frequently request visualization of the fetal genitalia.  During second-trimester ultrasonographic examinations it is usual to see fetuses explore their body and their environment. They handle their own feet, head, genitalia, umbilical cord, and so on.  We recently observed a female fetus at 32 weeks' gestation touching the vulva with the fingers of the right hand. The caressing movements were centered primarily on the region of the clitoris. Movements stopped after 30 to 40 seconds and started again after a few minutes. Furthermore, these slight touches were repeated and were associated with short, rapid movements of pelvis and legs. After another break, in addition to this behavior, the fetus contracted the muscles of the trunk and limbs, and then clonicotonic movements of the whole body followed. Finally, she relaxed and rested.  We observed this behavior for about 20 minutes. The mother was an active and interested witness, conversing with observers about her child's experience.  Evidence of male fetuses' excitement reflex in utero, such as erection or ″masturbation” movements,1 has been previously reported.  The current observation seems to show not only that the excitement reflex can be evoked in female fetuses at the third trimester of gestation but also that the orgasmic reflex can be elicited during intrauterine life.  This would agree with the physiologic features of female sexuality: The female sexual response is separate from reproductive functions and doesn't need a full sexual maturity to be explicit.2, 3  Copyright © 1996 Published by Mosby, Inc.",7795,4877,0,0,1,1,©

The word 'LEGO', when used as a noun, should only refer to the company that makes the product. Otherwise 'LEGO' is supposed to be used as an adjective. Thus, when referring to the pieces, neither 'lego' nor 'legos' is correct... rather one should say: 'LEGO bricks' or 'LEGO pieces' or whatever (using LEGO as an adjective -- and one should really capitalize all of the letters, and put the little 'circle-R' symbol after it (®)). This is all a matter of protecting the trademark of 'LEGO' for the company (using it otherwise degenerates the strength of the trademark).

Now if b is ⊥, d has to be ⊥ for ""b ↔ d"" to hold true. Hence it is not dangerous if you don't touch both wires. We can construct a contradiction between the two propositions ""b ↔ d"" and ""s ∧ c → d"" using the following interpretation: b false, s true, c true. According to the first proposition, d is false as discussed. According to the second proposition, d must be true by implication for the proposition to hold true.

t5_2qkib,huntingoctopus,1343016864,"pasted from http://www.susoils.com/camelina/  CAMELINA INFORMATION  Camelina sativa is a member of the mustard family, a distant relative to canola, and an exciting new player on the biofuels scene. Camelina plants are heavily branched, growing from one to three feet tall producing seed pods containing many small, oily seeds. It’s proof that good things really do come in small packages.  Camelina spreads workload and reduces risk. It is a short-seasoned, fast-growing crop that can help spread your workload. In the northern Plains, camelina is planted in early spring and harvested in late July most years.  In some geographies, farmers have seen success with fall, or dormant, seeding of camelina, which allows an even earlier start to the growing season.  Get something instead of nothing. If every drop of moisture is precious, you may want to consider camelina. It can produce seeds with less moisture so you’re assured of something to harvest. Plus, by maturing earlier than most other crop options, it’s not as dependent on rain later in the summer when Mother Nature can be more fickle. And since camelina can be harvested early, it allows ground to absorb later-season rainfall so it can enter the new year in a better position.  Some call it low input. Camelina can be low input – it can survive on little water, and it takes less fertilizer than many other crops. But it still requires management. Learn more by viewing our production protocols.  Sustainable Oils is working with crop protection companies to give growers more herbicide options.  Poast®, a post emergent grass control product, is labeled for the crop. Even with the availability of Poast farmers should apply glyphosate in the fall and perhaps even again before the camelina emerges to ensure the crop gets off to a good start. Camelina competes well against weeds once a crop is established, but it isn’t a miracle crop. Manage it right and it works.  Camelina can be seeded and harvested with conventional farm equipment.  Camelina has high oil and protein content. Camelina typically contains 35-38% oil, which is high in omega-3 fatty acid. This makes the oil fit for biofuels production and the meal a good option for livestock feed.  The emerging green fuel industry is turning camelina into a new crop rotation option and consistent income source for farmers. The seeds are easily crushed with oil being used for biodiesel or aviation biofuel that performs similar to fuels from other sources but can be more efficient.  The remaining meal is a protein-rich feed source for cattle, poultry or swine. Sustainable Oils has led an industry coalition that has secured approvals for feeding in rations for broilers, laying chickens, feedlot beef cattle and swine, and is working to secure camelina meal approvals for all animal uses.  An annual that originated in Northern Europe, camelina has many names: gold-of-pleasure, false flax, wild flax, German sesame. One of our favorites is Siberian oilseed; it’s such a hardy, cold-tolerant plant it seems to deserve that name. But whatever you call it, we think it spells a new profit opportunity for farmers in the US and Canada. Learn more about opportunities for growers.",1519,6925,0,0,1,1,®

t5_2qp5l,bearvivant,1343134860,"&gt;""Well, they can change and not be gay with Jehovah's help.""  It was my understanding that the WTS doesn't actually teach this. In the latest articles I've read that talk about homosexuality, they make the concession that it's something deeply engrained that people are born with. It was also my understanding that they would rather queers be celibate than try to force themselves into marriages. They differentiate between homosexual people and homosexual acts.  From ""How Can I Explain the Bible’s View of Homosexuality?"" (g 12/10 pp. 22-24) &gt;If someone says: “Homosexuals can’t change their orientation; they’re born that way.”  &gt;You might reply: “The Bible doesn’t comment on the biology of homosexuals, although it acknowledges that some traits are deeply ingrained. (2 Corinthians 10:4, 5) Even if some are oriented toward the same sex, the Bible tells Christians to shun homosexual acts.”  &gt;✔ Suggestion: Rather than get ensnared in a debate about the cause of homosexual desires, emphasize that the Bible prohibits homosexual conduct. To make a comparison, you could say: “You know, many claim that violent behavior can have a genetic root and that as a result, some people are predisposed to it. (Proverbs 29:22) What if that was true? As you might know, the Bible condemns fits of anger. (Psalm 37:8; Ephesians 4:31) Is that standard unfair just because some may be inclined toward violence?”",36100,27246,0,0,1,1,✔

t5_2qhos,ValZho,1343154328,"I can think of two other problems that I'm not seeing on all these (excellent) posts.  * When you look at spectrographs, speech sounds that you would label the same actually do vary from speaker to speaker and language to language. Your [ɛ], for instance, might vary in quality, formants, tone, etc. from mine or anyone else's. At what point does [æ] become [ɐ] become [ɑ]? (This is not to say that you couldn't just pick an average and go with that, though.) The point though is that speech, practically speaking, ends up being one of those continuous phenomenon that we apply discreet labels to—like color for example; if you move along the rainbow, at what point does the color stop being blue and start being green? Fuzzy boundaries.  * The much bigger issue, though, as people have alluded to, is that real honest-to-goodness tight transcriptions in IPA are huge pain in the butt. I can transcribe ""How are you?"" as [haʊ ɑɹ ju:] (common) but there is none of the requisite prosody encoded in that IPA (which can change dramatically—and, at least in English, can affect the syntactic functioning of the utterance). [˦haʊ ˦ɑːɹ ↘ju] conveys different nuance than [˨haʊ ˨əɹ ˩˥ju:] (I doubt I'm even transcribing correctly—like I said, pain in the keester for real, tight IPA.) Throw in tonal languages that have tone pitch per syllable, but can also have the relative overall pitch for phrases rising or falling... whew!",11155,4847,0,0,0,1,↘

t5_2qh1i,Asmith17,1343174619,"Pink Floyd - The Wall  And, I want to tell you why I think so, because I want you to know my own reasons for picking that specific album for that question, and I hope that after you read this, you will feel the kind of passion one can have for a very specific group of songs, and one specific concept.   Lots of albums today, based on the other comments on albums that they recommend, are made up of singles with a general theme, such as The Black Keys and their album El Camino. Sure, the music is part of the new wave of blues revival, which adds to the “character” of the band. That makes them awesome and entertaining, but one can go from one track to the next on the same album – they all stand alone. But the songs in The Wall play a different role for the listener, and in an age where an album was listened to with the same enthusiasm for going to see a movie, the music was often theatrical and what we would deem today in the most menial of ways as “artistic”.  Well, the Wall is without a doubt the most “artistic” album I have ever heard, and here's why  Disc 1: The story starts with the protagonist Pink. Pink grows up without a father, having lost him in WWII. Without a father, Pink grows up tormented by his overprotective mother, who then sends him to school where he is further oppressed by the abusive teachers and the evil headmaster. All of his memories about the abuse build bricks which are placed into his mind growing up, creating a wall which separates him from the outside world. Pink grows up to be a rockstar, gets married, but all the while the bricks continue to build – increasing his loneliness and frustration. When his wife leaves him, the wall is complete, and he is all alone in his head, surrounded on all sides by his trauma. Reality doesn’t exist anymore, and the world outside fades to black.  ––––INTERMISSION––––  Disc 2: In Pink’s new world, he rules as a rockstar dictator, in which he plays music to the masses in scenes of Nazi rallies and anthem-esque melodies. He executes fans that he deems as unworthy of hearing his art, which only adds to the torment of treating others the way he had been raised. After not being able to take the brutality anymore, he then places himself on trial for the crimes he has committed in his head. All of his past traumas come back and blame him for having feelings that contributed to his isolation. The judge in the trial orders the wall be brought down, at which point the album ends with a repeated melody from the start of the album, “Isn’t this where we came in?”  This entire story, in 26 songs, makes for one of the best examples of what art is for me; it is lens in which we see truths about life. The fact that such an important sentiment about society, made so artistically, having touched so many, and continues till this day as a prime example of what an album can be, THAT is real truth through art.   So, I recommend this album, I hope you enjoy it ☺  TL;DR : The Wall is awesome by virtue of the fact it is awesome",2126,484,0,0,1,1,☺

t5_2qioo,zeug666,1343230395,"Sorry, I can't follow along as well as I hoped at this time of the morning, but I think I get it - you want a device that has the power to run Photoshop, the ability to dock into a home setup, and have it mobile like a tablet.  Well, lets take a look at Photoshop (CS6):  &gt;Intel® Pentium® 4 or AMD Athlon® 64 processor &gt;Microsoft® Windows® XP* with Service Pack 3 or Windows 7 with Service Pack 1 &gt;1GB of RAM &gt;1GB of available hard-disk space for installation; additional free space required during installation (cannot install on removable flash storage devices) &gt;1024x768 display (1280x800 recommended) with 16-bit color and 256MB (512MB recommended) of VRAM &gt;OpenGL 2.0–capable system &gt;DVD-ROM drive  There are two ""Surface"" devices coming out: one with Windows RT and an ARM processor (this will NOT run x86 software) and another with Windows 8 Pro and an Intel Core i (I don't know hardware well enough to compare, but it should work). Windows 8 Pro should be bale to run anything XP, Vista, or 7 can run, so okay there. RAM: no clue - MS hasn't said anything yet. Storage: 64 GB or 128 GB with a microSDXC slot (so, what, another 32 GB?) you should be fine. Screen resolution - just like the RAM, they aren't talking, yet, but it should have a 10.6"" display and 10.1"" displays on a lot of tablets are running around 1280x800, so you will likely be fine). OpenGL - might be sketchy. DVD - HAHAHAHA, no.  The MS Surface is promising, but too far off to have enough information to know what it will be like (and what we know no can change). I think the bigger burden would be on Adobe to offer a version that will work with a certain level of tablet, but I wouldn't hold my breath for a quick (if any) release.  The MS Surface is expected to come out shortly after the release of Windows 8, so that would put it just before Christmas. There are still a lot of blanks for MS to fill in, such as RAM, resolution, and more importantly, cost.  ---  Another option would be a 'tablet PC' - a predecessor to tablets as we know them today, these laptop-like devices offered the benefits of a laptop with the addition of a more articulating screen, which was typically touch sensitive. [Tablet PC's @ Newegg.](http://www.newegg.com/Store/SubCategory.aspx?SubCategory=407&amp;name=Tablet-PCs&amp;Order=RATING) - as you can see from those options, they are laptops with touchscreens - they should have the power to use something like Photoshop, you can dock them with keyboards/mice and external monitors, and should be just as portable as a regular laptop. You may also notice that they cost more, but I don't think the trick screen comes cheap. Something to keep in mind when shopping around is that some new systems sold with Windows 7 may include a free upgrade to Windows 8 (after its release).  As a side note, I don't think anyone has really used Windows 8, so beyond the hype of it being shiny and new, I don't think there is much meat behind it, yet. If you really want Win8, wait a short while after it is released until the opinions/reviews of it come in.",210566,20469,0,0,1,1,®

Since I don't mind YOU getting a little educated, let me say that the word ""collective"" is used *as an adjective*, and as such already has a definition. Not all words used in legal documents have or need a ""legal"" definition.  Where it is used as a noun, the document makes it clear what definition it is using:  ""California law does not define collectives, but the dictionary  defines them as “a business, farm, etc., jointly owned and operated by the members of a group.”  (Random House Unabridged Dictionary; Random House, Inc. © 2006.)  Applying this definition, a collective should be an organization that merely facilitates the collaborative efforts of patient and caregiver members – including the allocation of costs and revenues.  As such, a collective is not a statutory entity, but as a practical matter it might have to organize as some form of business to carry out its activities.  The collective should not purchase marijuana from, or sell to, non-members; instead, it should only provide a means for facilitating or coordinating transactions between members.""  ag.ca.gov/cms_attachments/press/pdfs/n1601_medicalmarijuanaguidelines.pdf  Well, at least one of us is actually reading.

(g 12/10 pp. 22-24)  &gt;If someone asks: “Doesn’t your view of homosexuality encourage prejudice against gays?”  &gt;You might reply: “Not at all. I reject homosexual conduct, not people.”  &gt;✔ You could add: “To illustrate it, I also choose not to smoke. In fact, I find the very idea of it repugnant. But suppose you’re a smoker and you feel differently. I wouldn’t be prejudiced against you for your view, just as I’m sure you wouldn’t be prejudiced against me for my view—am I right? The same principle applies to our differing views of homosexuality.”  and  &gt;If someone says: “Homosexuals can’t change their orientation; they’re born that way.”  &gt;You might reply: “The Bible doesn’t comment on the biology of homosexuals, although it acknowledges that some traits are deeply ingrained. (2 Corinthians 10:4, 5) Even if some are oriented toward the same sex, the Bible tells Christians to shun homosexual acts.”  &gt;✔ Suggestion: Rather than get ensnared in a debate about the cause of homosexual desires, emphasize that the Bible prohibits homosexual conduct. To make a comparison, you could say: “You know, many claim that violent behavior can have a genetic root and that as a result, some people are predisposed to it. (Proverbs 29:22) What if that was true? As you might know, the Bible condemns fits of anger. (Psalm 37:8; Ephesians 4:31) Is that standard unfair just because some may be inclined toward violence?”  So basically, the JWs don't have an explanation as to *why* people are queer, but they do concede that people with same-sex inclinations/orientations exist. This is fine, since we all, according to them, have evil/bad inclinations. They draw the line at *acting* on those desires, however. As far as I know, they've stepped away from being able to cure queerness via opposite-sex marriage. **The ideal queer JW would be celibate**- knowing that their orientation is a result of sinful degeneration.  Eventually, they would be straight in the New System of Things, since that sinful condition will go away.  **As for college**, it seems like there's a difference between what the WTS teaches and what the culture is like in a particular congregation. My father was Presiding Overseer and I was able to go off to college after a lot of bitching. Some people on this subreddit never had a chance, while some never faced any pressure not to. The WTS sees college as a waste of time and dangerous since it takes time away from ""spiritual"" activities and it exposes JWs to, you know, knowledge.",36100,27246,0,0,1,1,✔

t5_2qh5b,gnomicarchitecture,1343353942,"&gt;X is a variable that I'm using as part of the definition of ""A ought to do X"", so you could replace X with ""murder"", ""not-murder"", etc. in the same way you could replace A with ""Alice"", ""Bob"", etc. There's no existential quantification over X like there is over p. Now, you were making a universal quantification over X in saying ""For any action X..."", which implies that I could replace X in ""there exists a P which is such that it is true, it cannot be made true or false by A, and A believing P will imply that A does X"" with anything I like (such as murder or not-murder) and produce a true statement.  I think we should formalize this to understand what's going on. The way I understood your def. was:  ∀a∀x {Obligated(a,x)↔[Ep (True(p) &amp; Independent(p,a) &amp; (Believes(a,p)→Does(a,x)))]}.   (All brackets are parentheses).   Where the domain of a is people, the domain of x is actions, the domain of p is propositions, Independent(x,y)=x's truth is independent of y, and the other predicates being clear. Which I read in Natural Language as:  For every a and for every x, a is obligated to x if and only if there exists a p such that p is true and p's truth is independent of a and a believing p implies that a does x.   If this is not what you mean, then a lot of what I'm saying probably doesn't apply.   &gt;t's typical to say that a combination of beliefs and preferences can imply an action (e.g., ""Evolution is a true scientific theory + I like learning about true scientific theories → I will study evollution""), but it would have to be a peculiar sort of belief that categorically implies an action all on its own, without regard to someone's preferences. (I think this is the main point of Hume's theory of motivation and the whole is/ought business.) So, ordinary beliefs about the world (""evolution happens"") can affect actions, but not in the necessary (or at least, unavoidable by change of preference or action) way which ""obligation"" demands.  This is assuredly true in a sense, that is, we don't normally talk as if beliefs by themselves entail actions, but that's probably because of the fact that you *can't have any beliefs* without any desires, similarly, you can't have any desires without beliefs, any motivations without desires, any desires without motivations, etc. In other words, *holism* is something we run into a lot, and so when we develop theories of belief, we often have a rich set of desire-belief pairs that we can match up with actions. However, there are desire-belief pairs which need to imply certain actions, in order that we have any psychological theories. Similarly, for every belief, a certain desire is required if that belief exists, and the other way around as well (you can't desire to eat snakes if you don't believe in snakes, you can't believe in snakes without desiring to go outside, etc).   Holism might be false, but I don't think that would help here, because that would just mean beliefs can be independent of desires or motivations. You would still need certain actions to be implied by beliefs, or else you are not going to be able to have any theorizing or generalizing about belief. I can't know what ""believing in the existence of the titanic"" is if there's no actions that it will imply. As a naturalist anyway.   &gt;For the &lt;{E,X}, G&gt; thing, we could define ""dependence on X"" in a purely extensional way by saying ""it must be possible to change its truth-value at least some of the time by changing the value of X"". However, I'm not sure if the incorporation of an analysis of p itself within the scope of quantification solves any problems which aren't solvable by other means.  Right, so, as you note below, you want a theory that will get you if a believes  ""a ought to do x"" then that implies that a does x. The way I suggested doing this is trying to include something about x in P. As of now, that's not happening. In other words, as of now, P can be absolutely anything, such as a belief in the existence of pineapples. We want P to be something like ""A ought to do X"". You said you didn't want something that direct at the risk of incoherence objections from non-cognitivists, so we'd have to skirt by it somehow. That's what the &lt;{E,X}, G&gt; is for. Your new suggestion seems to be:  P can be rendered false by switching X with another X.   Which helps, but I'm not sure how much. P might still be a belief in the existence of pineapples, where X is something like ""imagining eating a pineapple"". P might, likewise, be rendered false is you change X to ""attacking someone"", since pineapple belief doesn't imply you'll attack people but plausibly does imply you'll imagine eating pineapples.   &gt;Could you elaborate on that? I'm not sure what you mean by ""having a necessity operator where X is"" or ""in both places"".  I mean that if you say ""necessarily, A believes P implies A does X *and* X=something that has to do with P"" then that seems alright, but if you do this: ""necessarily, A believes P implies A does X *and* necessarily X=something that has to do with P"" seems to be asking for too much. I feel like the necessity operator is just more useful next to the new thing at the end, rather then before the conditional, because necessitating the conditional seems to be what is making it look like a law of psychology (specifically, the law that any belief implies an action), as opposed to a specific, important fact about normative beliefs.

He told me he hiked and climbed down 11 kilometers to get to a school. I asked him why he was studying and what he wanted to do? He told me that he studied because his father wanted him to, and he had passed away and he wanted to become the first teacher in the village. So I asked him, But there aren't any schools in your village. To which the little darling replied, well what am I for? &gt; &gt;There is nothing more sacred than the human devotion to knowledge, work and love. We are so bratty and ungrateful.

t5_mouw,HINKLO,1343405134,"I'll preface this with IANAD, but it would probably depend on the situation. Marrow matching is difficult in the family because you will only share about half (give or take) of your HLA markers with each of your parents. In most cases your parents will be a poor match, and each sibling has a ~25% chance of being a match.  &gt;You inherit half of your HLA markers from your mother and half from your father, so each brother and sister who has the same parents as you has a 25% chance of matching you. It is unlikely that extended family members will match you. However, your parents and/or children may also be tested to confirm your HLA typing and to make sure no possible donors are overlooked.  &gt;About 70% of patients who need a transplant do not have a suitable donor in their family. If you do not have a donor in your family, your doctor can look for an unrelated donor or cord blood unit for you. Your doctor can work with the National Marrow Donor Program® (NMDP) to search our Be The Match Registry® and other registries around the world — nearly 18.5 million potential donors and more than 590,000 cord blood units.   If there was a match, then they would probably search the registry for an unrelated donor without that predisposition first. If you were the only match at the point, they would probably weigh the risk of disposition to autoimmunity (which is a general risk for BMT to begin with) with the risk of not having a BMT done. Basically it would *probably* depend on how good of a match you are and how severe a condition your family member had.  If you are really curious about this, I would ask your doctor for more information. Do not take what I'm posting as medical advice.",15879,1475,0,0,1,1,®

t5_2sgq6,sVybDy,1343444017,"&gt;Also, Paper Mario is a rhythm RPG so that might be why you like it.  That has a lot to do with it, yeah. The ability to start battles with a well-timed first strike and the timed hits and dodges really helps keep me engaged all through the game.  &gt;Can you name any more specifics that you think give you these things you want?  Oh, sure. I was just trying to keep my post short, if you can believe that. But since you asked:  Interactivity — Downtime is the enemy here, so that means fast, twitchy arcadey games are the ones that offer this quality in spades.  Stuff like NFL Blitz (esp. 1998–2001) WWE All-Stars, WarioWare and pretty much your pick of bullet hell/shoot 'em ups fit in this category — though many of shoot 'em ups are overly repetitive, so few stand out. I'm currently playing Beat Hazard Ultra which is a lot of fun, and has a system of unlockable perks that gives me a goal to shoot for (no pun intended.)  Of course, that probably means the game will go stale once I'm finished with that part.  Lack of repetitiveness — Games that constantly introduce new concepts and ideas right up until the very end.  Mischief Makers on N64 is a good example of this; it seems like something new is always getting thrown at you.  One particularly outside-the-box level has you solving math problems to advance.  Kirby Super Star is a good example too, with nine smaller Kirby games all put together, each with their own feel.  And I suppose I ought to mention WarioWare again.  And game series that are continually innovating by adding new mechanics instead of relying on the same old, same old score points here as well.  The Super Mario series gets points here for rarely resting on its laurels, although a few of them almost seem cut &amp; pasted from other games in the series.  I'm really glad, for example, that we got Super Mario Sunshine instead of Super Mario 64 2.  Although who knows, maybe it would have been good; Super Mario Galaxy 2 had plenty of new stuff and didn't feel at all like a rehash.  Unreality — Well, I already mentioned Portal. I could also cite the Burnout racing games, as well as Crazy Taxi.  And Katamari Damacy (though the series is beginning to suffer from repetitiveness, but the original and the its sequel, We ♥ Katamari, were great.)  Also Spider-Man 2 (GameCube/Xbox/PS2.)  Any superhero game would sort of fit the bill here, but Spider-Man 2 was the one that *nailed it.* It scores high in the interactivity area due to the very direct and precise control you have over web-swinging, something every other Spider-Man title since seems to have decided was a stupid idea.  Motion Control — Kinect is truly an amazing device as far as I'm concerned.  Kinect Adventures is a ton of fun and a great starter game, and I found Hole in the Wall to be a really neat experience that couldn't be done any other way (I even bought the Deluxe Edition at four times the price of the downloadable version!) I'm also looking forward to Wreckateer, which was released this week but I haven't gotten around to buying yet (probably this weekend.)  But my favorite Kinect game is Rhythm Party. It's sort of a spiritual sequel to Dance Dance Revolution, where you use your arms and legs to hit targets that pop up around your body.  DDR itself deserves a mention, but it unfortunately fell victim to repetitiveness, and once they turned away from the jumpy J-Pop songs in favor of a more Americanized soundtrack, dropping the BPM and difficulty, it lost points in the interactivity category with me.  I haven't bought a DDR game for any modern system.  And I certainly can't forget the Wii — IMO the best motion control games for that are (in no particular order) Skyward Sword, Excitebots: Trick Racing, Elebits and Wii Sports Resort.  Randomness — Currently playing Spleunky on Xbox 360, even though I also played and beat the PC original. Fortunately the new one throws in a whole lot of new stuff.  If you don't know, what's great about Spelunky is that the levels are randomly generated every time you play, so every experience is truly unique.  Again I need to mention WarioWare (it's not my favorite game of all time but it does happen to hit a lot of my prioritized categories.)  Puzzles — Big list here. Tetris Attack for SNES is one of my all-time faves, though it could just as easily be Pokemon Puzzle League or the drab, uninspired, license-less Puzzle League for DS.  But Tetris Attack came first (in the US anyways) and none of its spiritual sequels have changed up the formula in enough ways to stand out from the original.  I also love Tetrisphere and The New Tetris on N64.  The New Tetris on N64 really changed the strategy of Tetris with the addition of multisquares and monosquares, which were formed by creating perfect 4 x 4 cubes out of 4 tetrominoes, which then yielded bonus lines once they were cleared away.  Compared to that, regular Tetris is boring now.  I also like a bunch of Popcap's stuff in the modern era, Bejeweled 3 and Peggle being recent favorites, and to be completely different, I also enjoy the Professor Layton series, as well as Telltale's Puzzle Agent.  Oh, and Infinite Interactive's Puzzle Quest series too.  And I was hyper-addicted to Dr. Mario Online RX again just a couple of months ago.  But I guess I've been cured of that bug (pun intended.)  Story — Again I'll mention the Metal Gear Solid series.  It had such a gripping narrative, that I couldn't help but need to know how all the twists and turns would work out.  They don't all have to be like that, though (which is fortunate since few games have this.)  Even woefully simple stories, like those offered in the Mario series of games, can keep me interested until the end.  But I really love it when they flesh it out, like in Super Paper Mario.  Colors — Many Nintendo games stand out here, with Mario &amp; Kirby at the top. I also should mention Tomba! for the PS1, which is lesser-known but a really fun free-roaming platformer with light action and mission-based goals with a few EXP-based character upgrades.  Tons of fun and one of my all-time favorites.  Humor — Some additional games I should mention here are Earthworm Jim 1 &amp; 2 (everything else afterwards kind of sucked), Zombies Ate My Neighbors, Portal 1 &amp; 2, and the Raving Rabbids series (although lately the series has been terribly plagued by thin premises and lousy controls, making them a real chore to play.  I think there's a new one coming out for Wii U and I'm not excited for it at all.  I'll need to hear great things about it before considering a purchase.)  Games don't necessarily need to be designed to be consistently humorous, either; as long as they have some good moments that can help make it worthwhile.  Like in Banjo-Kazooie, when approaching Gruntilda's chamber, the game starts playing ominous music, which suddenly gives way to calliope music as you teleport to Gruntilda's idea of a game show. That's an example of a hilarious swerve, not that the game utterly relied on it but it certainly made the game much more memorable.  Though humor is somewhat of a staple of the series anyhow.  &gt;Another RPG you might enjoy is Radiant Historia.  Thanks for the recommendation. I might it check it out someday, far into the future after I've cleared out my backlog of Steam games. Wish me luck!",12108,250,0,0,0,1,♥

t5_2qh5b,gnomicarchitecture,1343458690,"&gt;The symbolic logic you wrote matches what I would've said, but I still can't help but think I must be misunderstanding you or vice-versa. A and X are assumed to be specifically defined, at least within the scope of the definition; they're just placeholders to enable us to talk about the general schema of statements. We could restrict our analysis to ""Alice ought to drink water."" Inside the definition, A and X are fixed, and all we can ask is ""Is there a P such that... and Alice believes p → Alice drinks water""; we can't fiddle around with ""Alice"" or ""drinks water"" in there. Again, am I misunderstanding what you're saying? (This also relates to the paragraph of yours beginning ""Recall that X is still a variable"").  Right, so the original point I was raising here is that there isn't a P which is such that it is connected to any action X, of necessity. We can show this by looking at the definition:  ∀a∀x {Obligated(a,x)↔[Ep (True(p) &amp; Independent(p,a) &amp; (Believes(a,p)→Does(a,x)))]}.  let's use substitution here to make the right bijunct true:  True(P) &amp; Independent(P,A) &amp; (Believes(A,P)→Does(A,X))  the capitalized arguments are now names, and hence they are bound to predicates of specific objects. We see that belief in P by A is only contingently connected to A's doing X, since it's not the case in every possible world that A does X, or that A believes P. Nor is it even the case that in every world where A believes P, A does X (although we discussed the possibility of this previously, and if modified, that is suggested by the definition).   So let's say X is going to evolution school. Believing P implies that I go to evolution school, but it might also imply I go to business school, or literally anything else.   &gt;I still maintain that a combination of ""is"" beliefs won't in general cause an action; only a combination of ""is"" beliefs and desires will. (The reasoning behind this would seem to be the same as behind the is-ought gap; roughly put, take the argument on page 81 of Michael Huemer's Ethical Intuitionism and replace ""evaluative"" with ""action-implying"" and ""value system"" with ""behavior"").  I see, in that case, if you can avoid holism (e.g. let's say you could show holism was false), *then* you would be able to refute the anti-holist's objection. Although this would not constitute a demonstration that in the actual world, sole beliefs in general don't cause actions, it would only be a demonstration that in worlds in which beliefs appear alone (which is possible on anti-holism), they don't imply anything. In the real world, beliefs certainly don't appear to do this, and hence, they might imply the existence of a certain desire, which would in turn imply that you do a certain action.   Edit: I also don't see how karmo's proof works into this. Would the indexes v1 and v2 be specific behaviors? Or behavior systems? would C be an action implying proposition or simply the proposition that a descriptive premise P is action implying? I was thinking maybe you were getting at the idea that evaluative should mean behavior, so it refers to a specific action, such as ""john mows the lawn"", and value system should be ""desire system"", or (to demonstrate you point about belief-desire pairs) ""motivation system"" such that a desire system v entails a specific behavior, such as C. E.g. C is made true by certain desire systems. This way, you get the result that every argument with an action as a conclusion has got an action premise somewhere. However, you don't get the conclusion that the action premise is entailed only by a given desire system. Am I interpreting this right? The Karmo machinery may be obfuscating some of this.   &gt;The big question, though, is: how it it possible for anyone (such as Alvin Plantinga) to believe this? Isn't this a classic instance of Moore's Paradox?  That's a sort of higher order moore's paradox. That is, you're asking, I think ""how can the belief that there are certain beliefs which are true but not believable be a belief?"" One way of piecing out how is existential quantifiers. There may exist a belief I have which is mistaken, I just don't know which one it is. I might nevertheless believe that there is one rationally. I don't recall a specific paper which discusses being unspecific about mistakeness right now, but, as far as I know, I haven't heard many problems with the relevant belief. Do you have a particular reason you can't believe something like that?   &gt;I don't think a naturalist needs to say that belief must affect behavior. We can accept that a belief is a naturalistic phenomenon (e.g. a certain configuration of neurons firing), and that it might be possible to observe these neurons/whatever, without supposing that it must affect the behavior of the person.  Sure, if you can naturalize beliefs in some way that does not involve external behavior (you are still going to talk about the behavior of your brain, in any case). In any case, most naturalists seem to think that even if you got such a naturalization, it would implicitly rely on external behavior (""the neuron set A is the belief it is because it prompts the agent to behave this way and that way"").

t5_2qhwp,BobisOnlyBob,1343560333,"Gonna tackle these point-by-point. For a nearly 10-year-old list, it's held up remarkably well - not exactly a positive reflection on game development trends.  ---  &gt;I The first cut is the deepest (Skippable cutscenes)  This rule is upheld by a great many games nowadays. Start to pause and resume, back/select or a menu choice (down, confirm) to skip. Skipping a cutscene is a simple one-two motion that can only ever be done with intent.  &gt;II Knock three times (Breakable containers)  The fragility of crates can sometimes be an issue. Can we compromise at two, to prevent stacked crates as used for cover and the like to be a little less fragile? Naturally, forcing the player to repeatedly beat a box before they receive a prize or lack thereof sucks. The physics-enabled crates of modern games do make this a lot more understandable and palatable.  &gt;III Please, make it stop (When is it safe to quit?)  The greatest benefit of quick-saves - the ability to cease and resume at any specific moment - without the biggest drawback, the ability to ""cheese"" difficulty through quick-saving and quick-loading every 5 footsteps. Please, more games need this. Let us save at any time, even mid-gunfight, so we can leave and shut down and later return to the barrage of bullets as we left it, as if we'd done nothing but paused. Basically, any time you can pause, you should be able to *Save &amp; Quit*, and you should be able to *Resume Paused Save* from the titlescreen. The moment you load that ""Paused Save"", the record is deleted, so you can't repeatedly zap back to that same mid-battle point. That's what regular checkpoints and end-of-mission/act saves are for. (This will vary from game to game and genre to genre; I'm not saying every game should have save points or that no game should have quicksaves.)  &gt;IV Cruel and unusual (Long restarts)  Quick restarts are essential. Long game-over sequences, lack of regular and reasonable checkpoints, or sticking entire unskippable cutscenes in *after* the checkpoint (the reason I never got very far with *Red Steel*) are just wrong. I hear *Dark Souls* implements death and checkpointing via its bonfire system amazingly well; some games like *Too Human* fell massively afoul of this.  &gt;V It’s behind you (Camera controls)  LEFT STICK MOVE, RIGHT STICK CAMERA. CLICK THE RIGHT STICK TO RE-CENTER THE CAMERA. It's not that hard, people. On the PC, it should obviously be appropriately mapped to the mouse. Again, this has been better as of late, but it's 2012 and some games STILL suffer from dodgy camera controls. It's like a mental block the industry just can't get past.  &gt;VI The Sound of Silence (Volume and sound options)  I was really enjoying *Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep*. [Then **this** happened.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA3kyqPXPh4) If it doesn't put you into a comatose sleep, you'll rapidly lose your fucking wits... but I don't want to mute the combat and sound-effects. There's no option.  &gt;VII Choke chain training (Tutorials)  Can we just do away with button-by-button introductory tutorials? [A good tutorial is key to a game's critical success.](http://www.penny-arcade.com/patv/episode/tutorials-101) Every game involves teaching the player how to play it, even if it's the 10th installment of a generic shooter. Just make sure it's neither in the way nor entirely skippable. *Portal* and *Portal 2* are the single greatest examples of teaching the player without needing a traditional tutorial. Just listen to the damn commentary nodes!  &gt;VIII Out of your hands (Customizable controls)  [This is all that needs to be said](http://i.imgur.com/c7N3K.jpg). Don't let this happen to your game. Ever. Re-customizable controls are fundamental, not just for convenience, but for accessibility to both dexterity-impaired (sorry, lefties) players and players who have any sort of custom hardware for any reason. Laptops, disability keyboards, ergonomic keyboards - you can't compensate for all these possible designs with one control layout. Give that control to the players.  &gt;IX Previously on Edge’s sofa (Returning to the game after a long break)  Mission journals are always nice; maps with beacons and labels are even better. Giant pointing arrows are sometimes a bit too much, but rarely atrocious. Navi is going too damn far. Mission-sandbox titles - *GTA*, *Assassin's Creed*, *Prototype* and the like all do this pretty damn well.  &gt;X The final proclamation (Issue 10: The Struggle: Long Titles: Lazy punctuation)  While I partially disagree with this because of games like the *Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood*, *Revelations* and all the *Kingdom Hearts* midquels, it should be nipped in the bud before you end up with [Colon Cancer.](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonCancer ""☢CAUTION!!☢ TVTropes Link"") Capcom are the masters violating this particular rule. *Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney: Trials and Tribulations*. *Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike: Fight for the Future*. Even simple sequels end up as *Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening*. There's no need for this!  ---  EDGE's rules are good rules and should continue to be followed. Most of these - particularly the ones the industry still falls down on, like III, IV, VI and VIII - are about [game accessibility](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_accessibility).  &gt;Although Edge stands by its proclamations, it also expects that in another ten years, this list will look laughably obsolete. Hopefully, half of the things on it will have been rendered irrelevant by advances of gaming technology, and the other half will have become so deeply enshrined in game design that no one even thinks of them.  Sadly, the games industry still makes a lot of these mistakes. ""Wait, which sequel is that again?"", ""What was I doing again?"", ""Why can't I remap this??"", ""I HATE THIS SLOW TUTORIAL"", ""Oh god make it stop"", ""Killed by the camera..."", ""Ragequit because of the re-loading time after you die"", ""I can't stop right now!!"", ""Just give me the medkit already"" and ""Why can't I skip this!?"" are all still common refrains, even if more and more games are getting it right.",221981,35539,0,0,0,1,☢

Pictures Announce Third Film in The Hobbit Trilogy   &gt;BURBANK, CA, JULY 30, 2012 — Peter Jackson will make a third film in his upcoming adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien’s enduringly popular masterpiece The Hobbit, it was jointly announced today by Toby Emmerich, President and Chief Operating Officer, New Line Cinema, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, Co-Chairman and Chief Executive Officers, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios, and Jeff Robinov, President, Warner Bros. Pictures Group.   &gt;Jackson, the Academy Award®-winning filmmaker behind the blockbuster “The Lord of the Rings” Trilogy, recently wrapped principal photography on what he originally planned to be a two-film adaptation of The Hobbit, which is set in Middle-earth 60 years before The Lord of the Rings.   &gt;Jackson stated, “Upon recently viewing a cut of the first film, and a chunk of the second, Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens and I were very pleased with the way the story was coming together. We recognized that the richness of the story of The Hobbit, as well as some of the related material in the appendices of The Lord of the Rings, gave rise to a simple question: do we tell more of the tale? And the answer from our perspective as filmmakers and fans was an unreserved ‘yes.’ We know the strength of our cast and of the characters they have brought to life.  We know creatively how compelling and engaging the story can be and—lastly, and most importantly—we know how much of the tale of Bilbo Baggins, the Dwarves of Erebor, the rise of the Necromancer, and the Battle of Dol Guldur would remain untold if we did not fully realize this complex and wonderful adventure. I’m delighted that New Line, MGM and Warner Bros. are equally enthusiastic about bringing fans this expansive tale across three films.”   &gt;Emmerich stated, “We completely support Peter and his vision for bringing this grand adventure to the screen over the course of three films. Peter, Fran and Philippa’s reverence for the material and understanding of these characters ensure an exciting and expanded journey that is bound to please fans around the world.”   &gt;“With the abundance of rich material, we fully endorse the decision to further develop what Peter, Fran and Philippa have already begun. We are confident that, with the great care the filmmakers have taken to faithfully bring this journey to the screen, the film will be welcomed by the legions of fans across the globe,” said Barber and Birnbaum.   &gt;Robinov added, “Peter, Fran and Philippa have lived in this world and understand more than anyone its tremendous breadth and scope, and the relationships that bind it together.  We strongly support their vision to bring this great work fully to life.”    &gt;The first film in the trilogy, “The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey,” will be released December 14, 2012, with the second film releasing on December 13, 2013, and the third film slated for summer 2014. All three films will be released in 3D and 2D in select theatres and IMAX.   &gt;From Academy Award®-winning filmmaker Peter Jackson comes three films based on The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien. The trilogy of films are set in Middle-earth 60 years before “The Lord of the Rings,” which Jackson and his filmmaking team brought to the big screen in the blockbuster trilogy that culminated with the Oscar®-winning “The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King.”   &gt;Ian McKellen returns as Gandalf the Grey, the character he played in “The Lord of the Rings” Trilogy, with Martin Freeman in the central role of Bilbo Baggins, and Richard Armitage as Thorin Oakenshield.  Returning cast members from “The Lord of the Rings” Trilogy also include Cate Blanchett, Orlando Bloom, Ian Holm, Christopher Lee, Hugo Weaving, Elijah Wood, and Andy Serkis as “Gollum.”  The international ensemble cast also includes (in alphabetical order) John Bell, Jed Brophy, Adam Brown, John Callen, Billy Connolly, Luke Evans, Stephen Fry, Ryan Gage, Mark Hadlow, Peter Hambleton, Barry Humphries, Stephen Hunter, William Kircher, Evangeline Lilly, Sylvester McCoy, Bret McKenzie, Graham McTavish, Mike Mizrahi, James Nesbitt, Dean O’Gorman, Lee Pace, Mikael Persbrandt, Conan Stevens, Ken Stott, Jeffrey Thomas, and Aidan Turner.   &gt;The screenplay for “The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey” is by Fran Walsh &amp; Philippa Boyens &amp; Peter Jackson &amp; Guillermo del Toro.  Jackson is also producing the film, together with Carolynne Cunningham, Zane Weiner and Fran Walsh. The executive producers are Alan Horn, Toby Emmerich, Ken Kamins and Carolyn Blackwood, with Boyens and Eileen Moran serving as co-producers.   &gt;Under Jackson’s direction, all three movies are being shot in digital 3D using the latest camera and stereo technology. Additional filming, as with principal photography, is taking place at Stone Street Studios, Wellington, and on location around New Zealand.   &gt;“The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey” and its successive installments are productions of New Line Cinema and MGM, with New Line managing production.

TheMoreYouKnow!!!   Research Reveals Why Hungry People Get Cranky  Stress, hunger trigger fluctuating levels of the hormone serotonin in the brain, scans show  September 16, 2011 RSS Feed  Print  FRIDAY, Sept. 16 (HealthDay News) -- When people are hungry, they are more likely to be angry or aggressive. And now researchers have found the reason why: serotonin levels -- a hormone that helps regulate behavior -- fluctuate when people are stressed out or haven't eaten, according to a new study.  Rising and falling serotonin levels affect parts of the brain that allow people to control their anger, researchers from the University of Cambridge explained in the report published in the Sept. 15 issue of the journal Biological Psychiatry.  ""We've known for decades that serotonin plays a key role in aggression, but it's only very recently that we've had the technology to look into the brain and examine just how serotonin helps us regulate our emotional impulses. By combining a long tradition in behavioral research with new technology, we were finally able to uncover a mechanism for how serotonin might influence aggression,"" the study's co-first author, Molly Crockett, who worked on the research as a Ph.D. student at Cambridge's Behavioural and Clinical Neuroscience Institute, said in a university news release.  In conducting the study, the researchers controlled the diet of healthy volunteers to manipulate their serotonin levels. The participants' brains were then scanned using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) as they viewed faces with different expressions -- angry, sad and neutral -- to determine how various parts of their brains reacted and communicated with each other.  The study revealed that low levels of serotonin made communications between certain parts of the brain weaker than normal. The researchers concluded that when this happens it may be harder for the brain to control emotional responses to anger.  The participants also completed a personality questionnaire to assess whether or not they had a natural tendency towards aggression. Those that were predisposed to aggression had even weaker communication between certain regions of their brain when serotonin levels were low, the investigators found.  The findings could be applied to a range of psychiatric disorders in which violence is a common problem, such as intermittent explosive disorder, which is characterized by extreme and uncontrollable outbursts of violence, the authors suggested.  ""We are hopeful that our research will lead to improved diagnostics as well as better treatments for this and other conditions,"" the study's co-first author, Dr. Luca Passamonti, who worked on the research while a visiting scientist at the Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit of the Medical Research Council in Cambridge, England, said in a news release.

t5_2qh1i,Anna_Draconis,1343677582,"It was a day or two after our first date together.  My situation is kind of unique, or at least it is within the circle of people I know. I met him in Team Fortress 2 and joined his gaming community, then we flirted aimlessly over voice chat for a few months. He bought Minecraft to play it with me and we built houses together, and we went in on the Portal 2 2-pack to play co-op XD I was mildly crushing on this charming Internet stranger the whole time, but having a history of dating crappy guys and being emotionally unstable in relationships myself, there was no way I was going to make a move. Finally one day he said he was planning a trip to my city, I was all ""WTF WHY?"" and he danced around it until I got him to confess that it was to see me. I helped him pick out a hotel room to stay in, and it was only after he finalized the reservations did he tell me he had feelings for me too.  He came up for a long weekend, and the only times we were apart was when one of us had to use the bathroom really - Otherwise we were basically attached at the hip soon as he came in through the door. Before he came up though I had made him sit through a couple hours of me listing all of the problems I have - Paranoia, trust issues, etc. - and what I expected out of a relationship (Long-term only with having kids in mind) to make my intentions very clear. It was genuine but it was also to give him plenty of heads up as to what he was getting into and provide him with any red flags he needed to bail early XD But he stuck through it. I caved and gave him my home address, and we just spent the first evening cudded up in my bed watching Justice league, Babylon 5, Doctor Who etc. etc. while my reformed stray cat made sure he didn't try anything funny. It was a fantastic weekend, and absolutely soul-crushing when he finally had to go home. We both cried.  So, I spent a few days kind of biting my lip on all the welling emotions inside of me. This guy was fucking amazing. He did everything right - He has this very relaxed and casual nature about him that counters my often anxious and neurotic nature so he drew me in from the start. He told me later that he was focussed on just making me comfortable that weekend, and hell, it worked XD Anyways, at some point he asked me what was wrong and wouldn't let me say ""Nothing"" and leave it be. I tried to go to bed but he texted me further, so I texted back that we needed to talk. So he called me. I started bawling my eyes out on the phone because I was so worked up in my own emotions and I'm really not very good at communicating verbally XD So I talked him into letting me text it out, THEN he could call with his response. I texted him that I love him, that the days since he left I'd been super emotional because I missed him an incredible amount, and admitted that I might be jumping the gun on the love thing because of the distance although it felt right to say. He said he kinda figured that was the case, since I'd been dropping not-so-subtle Alt+3 ♥'s when signing off, and he reciprocated and told me he loves me too. We then started planning our second date.  Anyways, several long-distance dates and a year later, still going strong. I'm moving to his city for October 1st, by this time next year one of us will likely be in school while the other works a good job while we live in our new house :P  ♥",54987,331,0,0,0,1,♥

I would be very happy if they would remove that trait and raise the base regeneration rate by 2♦/10s (ideal), or at least raise the base regeneration rate by 1♦/10s and lower the trait to 1♦/10s. If necessary, you could cut down on other [2] initiative-related traits to keep things balanced. I would be far happier if initiative regeneration was based less on traits and skills.

t5_2r9tk,Hiskitten,1343698958,"Okay, big wide question and answer here. Transparency: i haven't read 50 Shades and there's a bunch of reasons for that. Not in any order:  - from what i have read upon picking it up and trying to give it a shot, the vocabulary makes me cringe. It is sophomoric and sorry if this makes me sound like a snob but i cannot read when i am cringing with every passage.  - the main characters do not portray the lifestyle. The female character is a virgin who is taken against her will...that is not the hallmark of BDSM. If it is not SSC: Safe, Sane, Consensual, it is abuse and it is not what we're all about.  The male character - from the reviews and the people who are in the lifestyle have told me - is the kind of Dominant who isn't embracing the role he plays. Almost like a ""I'm going to do this to you now, whether you like it or not. Is that okay with you?"" Not quite the kind of Dominant this lifestyle produces. Yes, there is discussion with the submissive about his/her limits and preferences but once that's established, there's no ""is that okay with you?""  - The author did no research of lifestyle-related norms. From what i know, she went into a sex shop. In any writing, shouldn't the author write what s/he knows, or has found out through research? i feel she did our lifestyle a disservice by portraying it the way she does.  i have heard people talk about it. i have read and listened to reviews - in depth and with spoilers - done by those who are lifestyle oriented. i trust their opinions. So i am commenting from what i've heard - because i don't want to pay for a book that circumvents the requirements i need in place for enjoyment of that book. i think the author took shortcuts and to portray a lifestyle that inaccurately, one that may awaken the desires of others to enter into this lifestyle - well, it can be unhealthy or dangerous.  Now, as for BDSM? It is a vast, diverse, wonderful, wild, soothing, exhilarating, unique-to-everyone lifestyle. Everyone has their own dynamic and while there are a great many similarities, you'll find every partnership comes with its own rules, preferences, norms, rituals, protocols, definitions.  The key, for me, in this lifestyle is my desire to give my control to my Master, and have Him make the decisions for me. Not work-related, or as relates to my kids, but everything that has to do with me personally: my way of dressing, my way of behaving, my sexuality...etc. i breathe to obey Him, and whether that means i dress a certain way every Wednesday, or do my hair the way He likes it every day, or not use a color nail polish He doesn't want, or perform for Him sexually, *that* is my desire. i don't question Him nor does He ask my ""approval"" when He wants to do something.  For some, pain is not part of it. For me, it is a craving - and for my Master, it is a big part of who He is. Same goes for sensual humiliation. i know the book has a ""red room of pain"". Here's the thing: my Master has redefined every single room in the house and reserve His right to play with - or punish - me in every one so that there isn't one particular place for it. Some partners have a specific room - and that's what i mean by the unique nature of it. But the over-dramatization of  the 50 Shades milieu just seems to be over-the-top bodice-ripper stuff, not a true portrayal of what can be a very subtle, or very intense relationship.  Hope this helps. i think i'll probably end up borrowing the book(s) from a friend...someday. When i have nothing else to read.  my favorite literature in the lifestyle? i love Story of O - my Master and i read it together (He had me read aloud) and then we'd talk about it. i love all the anthologies of short stories edited by Rachel Kramer Bussel, Alison Tyler, and Cecilia Tan, to name 3. They are short, to the point, and very hot. But they are accurate, and closer to what i experience than the 50 Shades books.  Hope this helps... ☺",392,1,0,0,0,0,☺

t5_2qqjc,aznsin12,1343704502,"MSG is still bad for you. I looked into the study and they were not looking for the right side effects: headaches, nausea, stomach pains, sensitivity to pain on skin. It is un-natural to ingest salt or MSG amounts to give that effect. Also, they are looking for ACUTE effects of MSG intake, not the chronic effects which can creep up on you later in life as the study in wiki looked into the effects on the day of ingestion.  The dependent variables that you need to look at are systolic/diastolic blood pressure, Heart rate, and blood volume. These are variables that can look into the effects of MSG ingestion and hypertension. You can also draw blood and see if there are increased reactive oxygen species which correlates to plaque build up. Unfortunately to study that I have will not be available to you unless you buy it. I'll give you the reference anyway. I have a PDF copy if you'd like. The study itself says that there is an increase in systolic blood pressure.  reference: Reducing Salt in Foods - Practical Strategies Edited by: Kilcast, David; Angus, Fiona © 2007 Woodhead Publishing Online version available at: http://www.knovel.com.proxy.queensu.ca/web/portal/browse/display?_EXT_KNOVEL_DISPLAY_bookid=1892&amp;VerticalID=0",2613,63,0,0,1,1,©

I've had very little personal experience with SillyKōnz^®, although enough to know I'm not a fan (especially when they've hardened).  I've seen tons of softball sized (and shaped) fake tits with small nipples/areolæ.  I'm not saying they're the *majority* of cases by any means... I'm just saying it's been my experience that they're not uncommon.  Nipples and areaolæ are pretty much like fingerprints and ears - all sorts, sizes, shapes, colors, etc.  I wouldn't begin to suggest that there's a uniform standard.  I'm merely saying that anecdotally bigger tits tend to have bigger nipples than one would find on a relatively flat chested individual.

t5_2s9km,jalez,1343753156,"From the free full text:  &gt; Before and after the diet period, muscle and fat amounts and percentages, were assessed by skinfold measurement which are highly related to percent body fat in fit and healthy young men [41-43]. We used software (Fitnext®, Caldogno, Vicenza, Italy) that includes 9 skinfolds (triceps, biceps, pectoral, subarmpit, subscapular, iliac crest, mid-abdominal, anterior thigh, medial calf), 6 bone circumferences (arm, forearm, waist, hip, thigh, calf), 4 bone diameters (elbow, wrist, knee, ankle), waistline and hip circumference measurement [24,44]). Anthropometric measurements were performed according to the Anthropometric Standardization Reference Manual [45]. Weight was measured to the nearest 0.1 kg using an electronic scale (Tanita BWB-800 Medical Scales, USA), and height to the nearest 1 cm using a Harpenden portable stadiometer (Holtain Ltd, UK). Skinfolds were measured to the nearest 1 mm using a Holtain caliper (Holtain Ltd, UK), and circumferences to the nearest 0.001 m using an anthropometric tape. All measurements were taken by the same operator (LC) before and during the study according to standard procedures [45,46]  So this was done with calipers, not BIA.  So it's likely that the relative changes were fairly accurate, but I have doubts as to the absolute values being 5-8% bodyfat.",9260,148,0,0,1,1,®

t5_2qhc8,Raging_cycle_path,1343767055,"67 and 68 live inside the bolt, right? I haven't played with an 870.  It's still that fairly thin bit of metal on 56 taking all the load of firing, but I guess that is a crazily low pressure.   I feel like the force on the locking mechanism should be ~ the pressure multiplied by the area of the base of the cartridge, which would reduce the differences.  .   Edit: ah hah! Looking at your 870 diagram, I can guess how it works, but trying to figure out my 590 led me to the answer.  This quote from [here](http://www.aimprotactical.com/aimpro_frequently_asked_questions_faq.htm) confused me, so I had a play and figured out what was going on.  &gt;the Mossberg® bolt lock is a completely through the barrel bolt locking system. The square cut bolt lock is captured in a square cut-out in the barrel, so at the time of firing, the strength of the steel-on steel lock-up is unsurpassed.  http://i17.photobucket.com/albums/b81/caughthog/P1010974.jpg  the top bolt is how it normally looks, the bottom bolt has the square protruding, which fits into a cut out in the barrel, and can see it popping up and locking in through my ejection port as I close the action.  So 56 is just to keep the action from unlocking, that big solid lunk on the top front of 68 is what actually takes the pressure of firing. This is a much more satisfying answer to me.",12334,462,0,0,0,1,®
