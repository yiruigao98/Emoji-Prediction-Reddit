t5_2qhkh,magick23,1354320550,"If it has been in the freezer, the moths won't breed in there anymore? Or just so they don't get in it before I put it in the feeder? Well, I'm actually thinking of not refilling the feeder anymore, it attracted so many birds that they would amass under my carport and throw the seed shells everywhere, there is bird poo everywhere, we witness bird fights all the time (even a bird murder, though the bird skeleton that resulted is kinda neat), and the birds would swoop through the carport when we went outside and nearly crash into us. When the seed runs out, there is a day or two of bird mutiny and I would get a taste of real-life ""angry birds."" I'm not sure if all that is worth it 😏 also, the birds are messy with getting the seeds out of the feeder and would drop seeds in all of my potted plants, so I'm having to pick out new growth all the time.  But anyway, thanks again for your help/info... I am still amazed by these leaf-miners, even though they are reducing my plants' leaves by about half at this point. ",164,1993,0,0,0,1,😏

t5_2qhv7,tumba_burros,1354324864,"**gente**  1. En el español general, este sustantivo femenino se emplea como nombre colectivo no contable y significa ‘personas’: «*La gente acudía a su bar*» (Obligado *Salsa* [Arg. 2002]); «*En torno a nosotros había un grupo de gente joven que reía y voceaba*» (Salisachs *Gangrena* [Esp. 1975]). Como otros nombres colectivos, admite un plural expresivo, usado casi exclusivamente en la lengua literaria: «*Fue ella quien me introdujo en las cosas, en las comidas, en las gentes de aquí*» (Benedetti *Primavera* [Ur. 1982]). La divergencia entre su referente (plural) y su número gramatical (singular) puede dar lugar a errores de concordancia (→ [concordancia](http://lema.rae.es/dpd/srv/search?id=XEVeLzVZaD6CG25cW5), [4.7](http://lema.rae.es/dpd/srv/search?id=XEVeLzVZaD6CG25cW5#47)).  2. En el español de ciertas zonas de América, especialmente en México y varios países centroamericanos, se usa también con el sentido de ‘persona o individuo’, es decir, como sustantivo contable y no colectivo: «*Luis era una gente muy caballerosa*» (*Prensa* [Nic.] 3.2.97); con este sentido, su uso en plural es obligado cuando se desea aludir a más de una persona: «*Alrededor de la tina, en la que podían caber cinco gentes, había muchas plantas*» (Mastretta *Vida* [Méx. 1990]). En España solo es normal el uso de *gente* con referente singular en la expresión *buena* (o *mala*) *gente*, que también se documenta en el español americano: «*Yo soy muy buena gente*» (Gala *Invitados* [Esp. 2002]); «*Tato, por su parte, no era mala gente*» (ÁlvzGil *Naufragios* [Cuba 2002]).  3. En el español coloquial de muchos países de América se emplea también, como adjetivo o como sustantivo, con el sentido de ‘[persona] honesta, amable y servicial’ y ‘[persona] distinguida o de buena posición’: «*Sería conveniente que llamara al doctor Pereyda* [...]; *él es muy gente y seguramente no le cobrará*» (Olivera *Enfermera* [Méx. 1991]); «*Ese es para mí menos que nada, aunque estos caballeros hablen de él como si fuera gente*» (Piglia *Respiración* [Arg. 1980]).   *Diccionario panhispánico de dudas ©2005 Real Academia Española © Todos los derechos reservados*",504,107,0,0,1,0,©

My mentally braced myself for whatever and pulled as hard as I could, but got nothing. After various attempts to pull we concluded the bowl had clogged so we cleaned it out and filled the water back up and packed it up. Again bracing myself I pulled as hard as I could as my friend held the lighter. I watched the smoke rush through the bong and up but I kept pulling watching the bowl torch almost completely before the need to cough over came me. After exhaling and coughing for about 10~ minutes I sat back down on what had become the most comfortable couch ever. For the next 2~ hours I sat there with tunnel vision watching these seasoned ents ask me questions and laugh a bit as I could barely comprehend what they were saying. The kickback ending I realized I had to drive my friend and I back to his then back to my house. Attempting to clear my head I drank a cup of water, washed my face, and gathered my friend and we set off home.

t5_2rske,gogge,1354366198,"[Centrum Specialist® Energy](http://www.centrum.com/centrum-specialist-energy) contains 40 mg magnesium (Magnesium Oxide) and 80 mg potassium (Potassium Chloride, same as mineral salts), the RDAs are way higher than that.  Mineral|Adequate Intake (mg) |:--|--: Sodium|1500 Potassium|4700 Magnesium|420 Calcium|1000  With keto you might not need the full 4700 mg of potassium, some recommendations are a bit lower at 2500 mg. You excrete more sodium the need for potassium is lower, with a high carb intake a high potassium intake is mostly to balance sodium levels (high insulin levels causes you to retain sodium).  &gt; The diuretic (dehydrating) nature of ketosis causes an excretion of three of the body’s primary electrolytes: sodium, potassium, and magnesium (31,40). These three minerals are involved in many processes in the body, one of which is the regulation of muscle contraction, including the heart.  Some studies show a net loss of calcium while others do not (31).  &gt; To counteract the excretion of minerals on a ketogenic diet, additional mineral intake is  required.  Although exact amounts most vary, suggested amounts for the three primary  electrolytes appear below (26,46):  &gt; Sodium: 3-5 grams in addition to the sodium which occurs in food   Potassium: 1 gram in addition to the 1-1.5 grams of potassium which occur in food   Magnesium: 300 mg    [""The Ketogenic Diet""](http://books.google.se/books?id=JtCZBe-2XVIC&amp;lpg=PA79&amp;ots=dNISh1zQJz&amp;hl=en&amp;pg=PA79#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false) by Lyle McDonald, page 79.  It's probably easier to get nutrients through food, or if you need potassium you can use a mineral salt. Using a mineral salt (like [Morton's Lite Salt](http://www.fatsecret.com/calories-nutrition/morton/lite-salt)) gives you 2500 mg potassium per 10 gram. A 100 grams of Spinach gives you [around 560 mg of potassium](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=spinach+100+gram), a 100 grams of Avocado gives you [about 450 mg of potassium](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=avocado+100+gram), a 100 grams of beef has [about 300 mg](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=beef%20100%20gram).  If you want to supplement potassium look for ""Potassium Citrate"" as that has good absorption rate, [and it's used in some studies as a way to prevent kidney stones](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19911683). In the US the regular potassium supplements are usually limited to ~100 mg, so most of them are practically useless.  Almonds has [289 mg of magnesium per 100 grams](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=almonds 100 grams), Spinach has 79 mg magnesium per 100 grams.  Examine.com has a list of some magnesium sources:  &gt; A few dietary supplements, usually those that are herbs or food products, may also contain Magnesium. These include:  &gt; * Basella Alba (Indian Spinach) at 114+/-1mg/100g * King Oyster (Mushroom) at 740+/-230mcg/g * Seeds of Mucuna Pruriens * Seeds of Irvingia Gabonensis (African Mango) at 429+/-0.3ppm dry weight * Royal Jelly at 217.493mg/kg  *Examine.com*, [""Magnesium, Sources""](http://examine.com/supplements/Magnesium/#summary1-0).  If you go for magnesium supplements you should look for ""Magnesium Citrate"" as it has a better absorption rate than other common forms like ""Magnesium Oxide"". Examine.com has some details under [""Forms of Magnesium Supplementation""](http://examine.com/supplements/Magnesium/#summary16).",15160,1,0,0,1,1,®

t5_2sokd,LeeHyori,1354383024,"Let's say tomorrow I went on my computer and started printing a bunch of papers with numbers on them (I am printing my own money from my computer).  Now, some people in my area really trust me and take my money seriously and have agreed to only take the papers I print as their currency.  Let's say that one of these people owns a coffee shop. In order to buy a latte at her coffee shop, they must pay in my papers. However, because people value my papers, no one is going to give it up freely. So, let's say that the coffee shop lists that a latte should sell for ♥20LHD (LeeHyoriDollars).  Now, the person who wants to buy this coffee needs to get their hands on some LHD. So, they go meet up with everyone who has LeeHyori dollars (perhaps on a small market, or at some booth that is willing to trade LHD for American dollars [USD]). They know they need ♥20LHD for the latte, so they go and they say ""Here, I'll give you $2 USD for ♥20LHD.""   The guy with the LHD says, ""Psh! No way! Give me $10 USD and we have a deal.""  The latte buyer responds ""Are you kidding? $5 USD.""  Finally, the guy with LHD says ""All right, fine. $5 USD and I'll give you ♥20LHD.""  Now, they trade. So, now, that means that the most recent market transaction involving USD to LHD set the *exchange rate* at 1:4. That is, $1 USD is worth ♥4LHD.   Other people seem to be agreeing around the same price and so most people start to trade at a 1:4 rate like this, and so (as of the moment) the exchange rate between $ and ♥ is 1 to 4.  So, if you want to put the latte in USD terms, then a latte that costs ♥20 LHD is technically worth $5 USD.  **Keep in mind:** You need to remember that money is something that is bought and sold as well. People have this notion that only ""things"" are bought with ""money."" But, no, money is a ""thing"" too; it's just a more ""liquid"" thing (easier to transact with), and so people desire it for that reason. So, exchange rates (which change constantly due to people trading, like the LHD and the USD folks) are really just a reflection of the supply and demand of a given currency.  As for purchasing power, let's say that near my house, a latte is around ♥20LHD, but in the USA, a latte generally goes for $20 USD. Let's say I have ♥20LHD in my wallet.  So, the ""purchasing power,"" say, of what I have in my wallet will get me 1 latte where I live. However, when I go to the US, when I trade my LHD for USD, I end up with $5USD only (because of the 1:4 exchange rate). So now, I can't even buy a latte in the US, because I don't have $20 USD. This is the relative purchasing power; my ""buying power"" of 20 LHD is weaker in the US than it is where I live. It's all just a comparison like that.  Let's look at the [Big Mac Index and the Starbucks Latte Index](http://www.google.ca/imgres?imgurl=http://media.economist.com/sites/default/files/cf_images/20040117/CFN272.gif&amp;imgrefurl=http://www.economist.com/node/2361072&amp;h=406&amp;w=265&amp;sz=14&amp;tbnid=CLHPlsSqcM9yQM:&amp;tbnh=83&amp;tbnw=54&amp;zoom=1&amp;usg=__P2oc_j3IlOAKhS_uJcYIin7FLPc=&amp;docid=cmOOHxE9EZP90M&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KT66UILxCqnI0QGU0YAo&amp;ved=0CDgQ9QEwAQ&amp;dur=117).  What it basically means to show is that when there is a disparity in purchasing power (like we had above), then either the LHD is ""undervalued"" or the USD is ""overvalued"" relative to getting the same item (they use Big Macs and Starbucks Lattes because they are common items found in so many countries). The reason why you say undervalued and overvalued is because there is no authoritative currency, so you have to talk about it always in relative terms.  And, for the sake of these indices, they usually normalize the price around the going price in USD as an arbitrary standard to make it easier to understand.    **Recap:** Remember, the value of a currency is whatever people value it to be. This is called subjective value (part of the subjective theory of value). http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjective_theory_of_value There is no ""inherent"" value to anything; the value of something comes from people's valuation of it. This is contrasted with the old obsolete view in economics called the Labor Theory of Value, which says that the value of something is the result of the labor that went into producing it. This, by the way, happens to be a backbone in Marxian economics, because when you understand the value of things through the LTV, then you see how when people profit, it means that they must be profiting off of the labor of laborers. Therefore, the only way to draw a profit is to exploit workers (the laborers that made the value of the item). Anyway, this is wrong.  Also, I used ♥LHD to try and get people out of the idea that there are these really authoritative currencies (well, there are, since governments usually monopolize the printing of ""legal tender"".) However, theoretically, money is whatever people choose it to be.  Lastly, I wanted to illustrate that the reason why people trade X for money is because people have agreed to accept money (say, ""dollars"")—making it very liquid. Liquidity is important. Currency could be anything. It could be toy ponies or gold. If I went to a Starbucks and they accepted toy ponies for lattes, and then everyone else in society stated to be like ""Okay, toy ponies are legit,"" then toy ponies would become a currency. Unfortunately, this isn't the case. People, instead, agree on some form of currency, so that they don't have to all barter with each other. So, money is highly liquid because everyone accepts it and it has a low transaction cost (makes transactions easier, faster, and is agreed upon by everyone, so it retains its value from exchange to the next).

COPYRIGHT INFO:  Source: http://www.copyright.gov/title17/  A quick review of the copyright laws, you may want to look into ""Derivative Works""  &gt;§103 · Subject matter of copyright:  &gt;Compilations and derivative works &gt;(a) The subject matter of copyright as specified by section 102 includes compilations and derivative works, but protection for a work employing preexisting  &gt;material in which copyright subsists does not extend to any part of the work in  &gt;which such material has been used unlawfully. &gt;(b) The copyright in a compilation or derivative work extends only to the  &gt;material contributed by the author of such work, as distinguished from the preexisting material employed in the work, and does not imply any exclusive right  &gt;in the preexisting material. The copyright in such work is independent of, and  &gt;does not affect or enlarge the scope, duration, ownership, or subsistence of, any  &gt;copyright protection in the preexisting material.  &gt;§ 106  ·  Exclusive rights in copyrighted works38 &gt;Subject to sections 107 through 122, the owner of copyright under this title has &gt;the exclusive rights to do and to authorize any of the following: &gt;(2) to prepare derivative works based upon the copyrighted work;  &gt;§ 401  ·  Notice of copyright: Visually perceptible copies2 &gt;(a) General Provisions.—Whenever a work protected under this title is &gt;published in the United States or elsewhere by authority of the copyright owner, &gt;a notice of copyright as provided by this section may be placed on publicly dis- &gt;tributed copies from which the work can be visually perceived, either directly or &gt;with the aid of a machine or device. &gt;(b) Form of Notice.—If a notice appears on the copies, it shall consist of the &gt;following three elements: &gt;(1) the symbol © (the letter C in a circle), or the word “Copyright”, or the &gt;abbreviation “Copr.”; and &gt;(2) the year of first publication of the work; in the case of compilations or &gt;derivative works incorporating previously published material, the year date of &gt;first publication of the compilation or derivative work is sufficient. The year &gt;date may be omitted where a pictorial, graphic, or sculptural work, with ac- &gt;companying text matter, if any, is reproduced in or on greeting cards, postcards, &gt;stationery, jewelry, dolls, toys, or any useful articles; and &gt;(3) the name of the owner of copyright in the work, or an abbreviation by &gt;which the name can be recognized, or a generally known alternative designa- &gt;tion of the owner.  The copyright laws aren't really clear, in my opinion, at least not in from what I read about derivative works, and the legality of distribution. But if the author of the original works never gave the author of the new works any contribution, it makes me believe that this is enough to call it an ""artistic rendition"".   There is some precedence, for example, Andy Warhol's artistic renditions of the Campbell's Tomato Soup Can.  When I was studying art in college, my instructor explained to us the legal requirements for ""artists renditions"", which was a minimum of 7 distinct differences between the original and the ""new"". If the author of the new works can clearly define the 7 differences between the original and the artistic rendition, he is then by definition of the law, in the clear. But does not mean that Apple or the owner of said copyright can't attempt to sue for damages. (Anyone can sue for any reason, doesn't mean they'll win.)  It's risky to sell a model of a copyrighted item, and unless you have the money to support yourself in a legal battle, and you have the evidence to back up your claim of Artistic Rendition; I'd suggest don't even try!  ----  USES:  What would you pay 100$ for a model of an iphone for?  I'd guess to make an advertisement. To attempt to show that an app or website running on the iphone without actually having one for a photo shoot?  Lets say you've got a business that buys and sells old phones. You don't have the money for a full live action commercial, so you get a rendered version, and you want to show people that they can sell their old iPhone to you... your animated character can hold an artistic rendition of an iphone, or other android device. And he can drive away in his 3d model of a Ferrari.  ----  In the end, if you want to get into that business of it, I'd suggest talking to a copyright lawyer. Find out what your responsibilities are as an artist for making renditions of copyrighted works. And what your legal claims are for the original renditions.  I'm not a lawyer, and this article is purely my opinion on the matter. I would recommend talking to a lawyer about this before attempting to sell any 3d models (even artistic renditions) of copyrighted materials.  ----  *Edit: After some more research, I feel there is a big problem with our patents system vs copyright system. For copyrighted material, all you need to do is clearly state that the material is copyrighted to the owner, and any income derived from the materials should be given as royalty to the owner of the copyright. (At a percentage)... where patents, like what apple has, on the design of the iphone, should not ever happen, it's an artistic design that has no function on the device. Where apple shouldn't be able to sue over the ""rectangular"" shape of a phone design patent, because that is not patent-able. The rectangular shape is only copyright-able, and should never have been patented. What is patentable on the iphone, (from a design aspect) is only the antenna design that uses the materials of the case/cover to extend the antenna capability.*  *Since the ""design"" of the iphone is a patent, this is different than copyright laws! So everything I've said above has no bearing on the issue of what is legal for artistic rendition of ""patented designs""... In fact, I can't find anything readily available on this issue. And may be a moot issue since it's patented and not copyrighted. So you may be able to use the depiction of a patented design without regard. BUT I HAVE NO IDEA!*  The only answer that anyone can really give is; **(TL;DR) Talk to a patent attorney and/or a copyright attorney, within regards to if you can legally make an income on patented/copyrighted designs.** A royalty may apply, and the artist who has the material on some website may have rights to do so with royalties paid or contracted.

Deuteronomy 22:28-29 (King James Version)  28If a man find a damsel that is a virgin, which is not betrothed, and lay hold on her, and lie with her, and they be found;   29Then the man that lay with her shall give unto the damsel's father fifty shekels of silver, and she shall be his wife; because he hath humbled her, he may not put her away all his days.

'Lego' and 'Legos' are simply colloquial words used in informal language, which are both accepted, just one isn't accepted by one group who thinks there term is better, even though it is technically as wrong as the other term.  The deeming of the ""correct"" plural version of Lego 'bricks' may date back to a printing of a 1980 Lego Catalog where the following was printed by the Lego Corporation:  &gt;Dear Parents and Children           The word LEGO(R) is a brand name and is very special to all of           us in the LEGO Group Companies. We would sincerely like your           help in keeping it special. Please always refer to our bricks           as 'LEGO Bricks or Toys' and not 'LEGOS.'

That letter never mentioned the plural version of 'Lego' to be 'Lego' and had no intention to do so. Their intention, which failed miserably, was to get people to call them 'Lego Bricks' or 'Lego Toys' as opposed to 'Legos'/'Lego.'  Personally, I would take that letter on the back of the catalog to give more credence to the colloquial plural term of 'Lego' to be 'Legos' over 'Lego' as the Lego Corporation is verifying the usage of the term 'Legos' to being used as the plural form of 'Lego' when referring to be playing with multiple 'Lego Bricks.'

You're still not going to use a $400 camera to shoot a feature film though - just because it is 4K doesn't mean it has the quality you need.  Think about a smartphone camera. Some of them are 12mp. That really means nothing. It's not equal to a 12mp DSLR because the sensor and everything else about it is different.  Also, 1080p is 1920x1080, not 800.  Most theatres that have recently upgraded to digital projection are running 2K or 4K projectors. Empire Theatres here in Canada use Barco projectors.

Securing a Latin American player is the priority.* &gt; &gt;By Kevin Baxter &gt; &gt;8:05 PM PST, December 2, 2012 &gt; &gt;The Galaxy celebrated Saturday's MLS Cup victory deep into Sunday morning. But when Coach Bruce Arena and Tim Leiweke, the team's chief executive, awoke later that day, the countless champagne toasts weren't the only things that had their heads spinning. &gt; &gt;Because after winning consecutive league titles with David Beckham and Landon Donovan, the team must now figure out a way to win without one and possibly both players. &gt; &gt;""There's little doubt in my mind that we're going to have some transition here,"" said Leiweke, president of AEG, the global sports and entertainment company that owns the Galaxy. ""We'll play it out, see what happens. But you make good decisions by being prepared."" &gt; &gt;Which is why Leiweke and Arena began talking over off-season scenarios even before the Galaxy began its victorious playoff run. They started preparing for Beckham's MLS retirement during the summer, weeks before it was announced publicly. What Donovan will do is less certain; the player, who has a year left on his contract, says he doesn't know whether he'll play next season. &gt; &gt;That leaves the team with one, maybe two, designated player spots — exemptions to the league's frugal salary cap that allow teams to sign big-name stars to MLS contracts — and Leiweke has been hard at work on filling those. Last month, the Galaxy was in talks with former FIFA world player of the year Ronaldinho, but last week the 32-year-old signed a contract extension with his Brazilian club, Atletico Mineiro. So Leiweke has turned his attention to Kaka, another former world player of the year from Brazil who currently plays for Real Madrid. &gt; &gt;Chelsea's Frank Lampard has also reached out to the Galaxy, but Leiweke said the team's new contract with Time Warner Cable and its Spanish-language channel make the signing of a Latin American player a priority. &gt; &gt;""Look, if Wayne Rooney wants to come, we'll make an exception. But the reality for us right now, our thinking, is … iconic players that have a special relationship with the Hispanic community,"" he said. &gt; &gt;The Galaxy's third designated player, striker Robbie Keane, is under contract for two more seasons with an option that could keep him here through 2015. But squeezing the rest of the roster within the league's complicated salary budget of roughly $4 million for next season will be tough. &gt; &gt;Midfielders Mike Magee and Juninho — on loan from Sao Paulo — will be out of contract at the end of the year, as will goalkeeper Josh Saunders, whose future with the team is further clouded by the Galaxy's interest in trading for Chivas USA keeper Dan Kennedy. &gt; &gt;The entire backline of Omar Gonzalez, A.J. DeLaGarza, Todd Dunivant and Sean Franklin is signed for another year, although the team expects Gonzalez, the MLS Cup most valuable player, to draw loan interest from several European clubs. Midfielder Marcelo Sarvas and forward Edson Buddle are also signed, and midfielder Christian Wilhelmsson has an option for next season that may prove too expensive for the Galaxy to pick up. Unlike other pro leagues, MLS' strict salary rules do not allow teams to pay a tax for violating the payroll cap. &gt; &gt;""My guess is we're going to have a lot of questions,"" Arena said. ""It's never smooth, although you'd like it to be. There's always another issue that comes along and makes things difficult. And I'm sure we're going to have it again this year."" &gt; &gt;The Galaxy will hold a public victory celebration Monday at 7 p.m. in the Home Depot Center's tennis stadium. The entire roster, including Beckham and Donovan, is expected to participate. &gt; &gt;kevin.baxter@latimes.com &gt; &gt;Copyright © 2012, Los Angeles Times",5630,3580,0,0,1,1,©

t5_2qpp6,Jo3M3tal,1354565207,"&gt; 1\. Redesign Thor ability/Raven seeker missile  Thor ability is bad game design wise, seeker missile is good but too hard to use.  Glad to see Blizzard addressing this  &gt; 2\. Push early game Reaper a bit more  Wasn't really needed, I felt like early game reaper would be more common in the future, it is just hard to use so therefore takes time.  Blizzard has to be careful buffing stuff like this, look how long it took for everyone to realize how op infestors were.  &gt; 3\. Hellbats better against melee units, not necessarily better vs. Ranged.  This is really one of the major problems right now with Mech in TvP, chargelots still destroy the composition.  Blueflame hellbats don't really destroy them fast enough, and your tanks end up killing your hellbats.  Hopefully Blizzard found a good way to address this considering how effective hellbats are in TvZ.  &gt; 4\. We'd really like to see more Medivac usage like we saw in Wings for a time in the past. Currently thinking on a cooldown based speed booster ability.  This seems sort of silly.  Again as player skill increases you see a trend of more medivac usage (really it is just that good players retreat their medivacs early and/or pick battles that wouldn't cost them medivacs).  Would be really interesting (and good for the game) with more abilities, and speed boost would be amazing imo.  I don't think a cd is nessisary, energy usage would be really interesting (and would allow you to burn their energy intentionally if you suspect they have high templars waiting for your drop)  &gt; 5\. Buff Bio in the late game - with the addition of new units in HotS, we feel Bio in the late game is a bit weak.   Nailed it.  &gt; 6\. Buff mech in general - we'd like to maybe test combining the vehicle and air upgrades at the armory.  Buff yes.  With the trend for an increase in map size this is needed.  Vehicle and air upgrades is sort of odd, as it gives mech a smoother transition into the late game with free viking upgrades to deal with colossus as well as the upgrades needed to transition into sky terran.  Combining upgrades actually shortens to long tech tree of terran, and I don't really see that as a positive.  Of course it helps terran, but from a game design standpoint I am against it.  &gt; 1\. Hydralisk movement speed upgrade to Lair  Expect to see a lot more hydralisks.  This basically makes them viable and deadly in every matchup.  The hard counters to hydralisks (tanks colossus storm) get much less effective with hydralisks move speed.  Roach Hydra or even just pure Hydra is going to be very popular for a very long time.  &gt; 2\. Mutalisk buff to speed and/or acceleration  I am hoping they buff speed.  A buff to acceleration means they react faster and punish bad micro less.  A buff to speed means they just have a straight up buff, and still punish bad micro.  Low acceleration mutalisks is good for gameplay because it forces you to keep your mutalisks moving.  &gt; 3\. Ultralisk changed to be good vs. all ground  We shall see what that means.  It currently is much less effective against marines and zealots than you would think, but appropriately effective against armored targets (they chew through tank lines incredibly fast).  Ultralisks will be a much more effective standard unit if this change goes through, which I see as a good thing from game design standpoint because it offers more stylistic options (like mech vs bio).  &gt; 4\. Nerf Infestor quite heavily  We all saw that coming, makes sense.  &gt; 5\. Make it easier to unburrow and reposition Swarm Hosts  Bad for the game as it punishes bad decisions less, but good for the game as it offers a higher skill ceiling on speed of micro.  I would actually like to see swarm hosts generate locusts slower (or even not at all) when unburrowed.  Right now they don't fill their role of area denial, and are actually more like super long range attacking units.  Blizzard is trying to remove their area denial functionality to give them better micro functionality.  &gt; 1\. Redesign Voidray - we're currently thinking of having the player choose when to activate the charge up ability.  Voidray was a sleep inducing unit, glad to see Blizzard considering the redesign.  &gt; 2\. Oracle - pulsar beam would now overlap too much with the new Voidray, so we'd like to change the Oracle to be more of a worker harasser.  Nooo!  I liked this one, but some interesting worker killing abilities would be ok too.  Maybe blizzard wasn't a fan of 4 oracles flying around the map sniping bases.  &gt; 3\. Buff DTs not necessarily for the DT rush case, but to have DTs more often in the late game.  DT rushes are not very powerful at high levels of play, so that is curious that they would even consider that.  DTs are really powerful in late game, but I admit they could use a buff here.  Good change, DT play had gotten stagnant.  &gt; 4\. Nerf Vortex - we don't like how all or nothing this ability is in Wings, and with new unit adds, we feel we can remove or phase out this ability.  Hooray!  ♥  &gt; 5\. Fix Tempests to not counter all late tech Zerg. We currently don't like how Zerg can't go Tier 3 units if Tempests are in play.  Yes!  Tempests countering swarm hosts and brood lords AND ultralisks was really silly.  Maybe give them a small splash so they are better against broodlords but not as good against ultralisks?  They could even just give them increased damage on air attacks and the unit would be fine (they are supposed to counter carriers and colossus as well)  &gt; 6\. Make Voidray + Phoenix + Oracle combo a viable strat overall.   Pure air armies don't have the limited movement constraints of ground armies.  Making pure air armies viable throughout the entire game is bad because it limits positional options.  I hope Blizzard realizes this before it is too late.  ####8/10 Good effort but not flawless.  Attempts at fixing bad game design choices, but also evidence at continuing the trend to a small degree in the future.",19763,804,0,0,1,1,♥

The ones I don't address i either agree with you on, or it's not that big of a deal.  &gt;3. Hellbats better against melee units, not necessarily better vs. Ranged.  They absolutely shred zealots, especially if they have literally any concave. zealots/archon/ immortal/ (air in some situations) is the counter to mech because you have to be mobile in order to counter it. You never want to fight the whole mech army straight on but sometimes you dont get a choice.   I agree with the medivacs. It's a dumb idea. People aren't using medivacs as much because everyone wants to try out new units. It is after all...the beta.  &gt;5. Buff Bio in the late game - with the addition of new units in HotS, we feel Bio in the late game is a bit weak. Nailed it.  I hope to God this was sarcasm. If it's not...then wtf. Why would you encourage someone to stay on tier 1 units late game? Don't tell me they don't have other viable options. If that's the problem, then buff them not bio. That just makes no sense.  &gt;2. Mutalisk buff to speed and/or acceleration  This doesn't need a buff...Mutas are the one of the fastest units in the game, and phoenix being the counter are faster, but only attack air. It seems dumb to buff them seeing as they are already fast as fuck and are dumb to play against as toss. The technical counter to mutas is mass expanding and that's going to be exponentially harder if they are faster.  I don't know enough about ultralisk play but all I know is with insane armor they aren't really that terrible vs zealots.. marines + stim/kiting possibly.  &gt;4. Nerf Vortex - we don't like how all or nothing this ability is in Wings, and with new unit adds, we feel we can remove or phase out this ability. Hooray! ♥  I sense a zerg player. It has been said by almost everyone including literally every caster that the only real counter to late game zerg is the mothership. So unless they bring another viable option (don't even say tempest because that's really not a viable strat/counter) There will be virtually no way to win late game.  &gt;5. Fix Tempests to not counter all late tech Zerg. We currently don't like how Zerg can't go Tier 3 units if Tempests are in play.  This was dumb altogether. Tempests are so bad in direct engagements. corruptors are really good vs them and the swarmhost/corruptor attack is pretty damn hard to stop already. Good luck beating it now.   It's really a lot of unnecessary changes. I feel like these buffs are just trying to keep the peace because they are nerfing somethings (on zerg at least, im not sure what the hells going on with terran)",13730,1324,0,0,1,1,♥
t5_2qh7f,Funkyjhero,1354593453,"I wouldn't put Splenda in my food either   How Sucralose (aka Splenda) Is Made And Why You Want To Avoid It I wanted to comment on Splenda.  Splenda, also known as sucralose, was created accidentally when some chemists were trying to produce an insecticide.  Here is the process by which they produce the formula sold in stores:  “1.  Sucrose is tritylated with trityl chloride in the presence of dimethylformamide and 4-methylmorpholine, and the tritylated sucrose is then acetylated with acetic anhydride.  2.  The resulting sucrose molecule TRISPA is chlorinated with hydrogen chlorine in the presence of tolulene.  3.  The resulting 4-PAS is heated in the presence of methyl isobutyl ketone and acetic acid.  4.  The resulting 6-PAS is chlorinated with thionyl chloride in the presence of toluene and benzyltriethylammonium chloride.  5.  The resulting TOSPA is treated with methanol in the presence of sodium methoxide to produce sucralose.”  (Note that methanol, wood alcohol aka paint remover,  is one of the questionable ingredients in aspartame.)  In addition, the bags and packets of Splenda commercially available are not pure sucralose.  They also contain bulking agents.  All artificial sweeteners use bulking agents.  Do you know what they use?  Sugar.  Dextrose, sucrose, and maltodextrin.  (Maltodextrin is corn syrup solids composed primarily from fructose and glucose in a starch form.)   All sweetener packets are at least 96 percent sugar.  Splenda is 99% sugar.  The packets are labelled calorie free as a result of manipulating a loophole in the food labeling laws.  The product can be described as sugar free if a serving contains less than 5 grams of sugar, and calorie free if a serving is less than 5 calories.  So they set the serving size on bags at .5 grams  and the packets contain a serving of 1 gram.  A one gram packet contains 4 calories.   This can be confirmed on the manufacturer’s website in the FAQ section:  “Like many no and low calorie sweeteners, each serving of SPLENDA® No Calorie Sweetener contains a very small amount of common food ingredients, e.g., dextrose and/or maltodextrin, for volume. Because the amount of these ingredients is so small, SPLENDA® No Calorie Sweetener still has an insignificant calorie value per serving and meets FDA’s standards for “no calorie” sweeteners. “  To make matters worse, when sucralose was shown to not raise blood sugars, it was the pure substance that was tested, not the mixture that is sold to the public.  Dextrose, sucrose, and/or maltodextrin are definitely going to raise a diabetic’s blood sugar.  There is also a great deal of evidence that artificial sweeteners actually cause an increase in appetite, causing people who consume them to take in more calories than they would otherwise.

t5_2reni,seanrowens,1354596633,"So, I've looked around a lot on the web and the leatherman.com site.  So far I'm leaning towards finding a a Juice CS4 or a used PST/II.  I still need to investigate multi tools from Victorinox.  I wrote up some notes, mostly for myself, but then I thought they might possibly be useful for others, so I cleaned them up a tiny bit and am including them here.  (And I really want scissors but I have this major urge to get a Skeletool CX or a OHT.)  Criteria;  * Price - not that big a deal for me, I can afford it and it's money well spent as long as I don't lose it. :-) * Light! (NOTE, Wave is 8.5 oz, for comparison, Pulse is 6, PST/II is 5) * easy to use (so, light, but not tiny, decent sized handles) * One handed opening of at least the main blade, more is better * locking tools/blades - I like blades especially to lock when opened * tool selection - After thinking about what I use on the Wave other than the blade and the pliers, I realized I  MUST have scissors.  The saw is pretty handy too. Corkscrew, awl, file, are nice to have. * I don't care about color much.  Suggestions came from this post on reddit /r/EDC and also from this really really long forum thread I found; ""Best LIGHTWEIGHT multitool???"" http://edcforums.com/threads/best-lightweight-multitool.58082/  1) Leatherman Skeletool CX - the Skeletool is the lightest fullsize, I recall seeing comments on the web or reddit that it is not as sturdy as one might like. The CX blade is made of better steel than the non CX.  One handed opening blade is really easy to use, unlike the Juice blades which are reportedly awkward but possible to open one handed..  One random thing, the carabiner lets you clip it to something momentarily to let you then one handedly open tools (i.e. if your other hand is full).  NO SCISSORS.    Note, the Skeletool and Skeletool CX look to be exactly the same, same set of tools, same size and weight, except for the steel in the blade.  All tools lock.  2) Leatherman OHT - One Hand Tool - I dig the one handed opening concept a ton http://www.leatherman.com/product/OHT 4.5 inch (closed) and 9.9 ozes YIKES heavy - maybe good for camping or whatever, rather than EDC.  $60 to $80 depending on where you get it (REI is $80) having trouble finding it on amazon Wow, lacking tools, considering it's weight, but everything it has is one handed and locking; 420HC Knife, 420HC Serrated Knife, Spring-action Needlenose Pliers, Spring-action Regular Pliers, Spring-action 154CM Replaceable Hard-wire Cutters, Spring-action 154CM Replaceable Wire Cutters, Large Screwdriver (fixed), Medium Screwdriver (fixed), Phillips Screwdriver (fixed), Small Screwdriver (fixed), Saw, Bottle Opener, Can Opener, Integrated Lanyard Attachments, #8-32 Cleaning Rod Attachment, Oxygen Tank Wrench, Strap Cutter.  NO SCISSORS.  3) Leatherman Juice line - C2, CS2, CS4, Xe6  (CS4 has more tools, slightly larger ""The CS4 adds wood saw, corkscrew and awl"") - reddit guys recommended it, meant for carrying in pocket, smaller than a fullsize multitool, from forum ""The best lightweight MT IMO is the LM Juice S2. It has a better tool selection than the Skeletool and it has scissors!""   All of them have 420HC Knife, Needlenose Pliers, Regular Pliers, Hard-wire Cutters, Wire Cutters, Extra-small Screwdriver, Medium/Large Screwdriver, Phillips Screwdriver, Small Screwdriver, Bottle Opener, Can Opener  * Juice C2 - 4.3 oz, Corkscrew w/Assist, * Juice S2 - 4.4 oz, Scissors * Juice CS4 - 5.5 oz, Corkscrew w/Assist, Saw, Awl, Scissors,  * Juice Xe6 - 6.7 oz, 420HC Serrated Knife, Corkscrew w/Assist, Awl, Saw, Diamond-coated File, Wood/Metal File.  Weightier but nice.  Compare with Pulse or PST/II.  4) Leatherman Charge?   Someone on Reddit recommended this, it's 8.2 oz, barely lighter than the Wave/   Charge TTi is the ""lightest full size leatherman tool"" according to forum. Tons of tools. Needlenose Pliers, Regular Pliers, Wire Cutters, Hard-wire Cutters, Crimper, S30V® Knife, 420HC Serrated Knife, Cutting Hook, Saw, Scissors, Wood/Metal file, Diamond-coated file, Large Bit Driver, Small Bit Driver, Medium Screwdriver, Ruler (8 inch/19 cm), Bottle Opener, Can Opener, Wire Stripper, BIT KIT: Phillips #1-2, Screwdriver 3/16"", Screwdriver 1/8"" and Torx #15, Hex 5/32"" and 9/64"", Hex 1/8"" and 7/64"", Hex 3/32"" and 5/64"", Hex 1/6"" and .050"", Square Drive #2 and #3, Phillips Eyeglass Screwdriver and Flat Tip  5) Leatherman Pulse - Buh, wait, I have one of these, it was a gift for being a best man and I loaned it to my brother some time back.  Discontinued so look for it on ebay, but apparently pretty light and small, 5.8 oz, 4 inch when closed,  more tools than the Skeletool and the tools lock. 420HC Stainless Steel Clip-point Knife, 8 in | 20 cm Ruler, Bottle Opener, Can Opener, Diamond-coated File, Extra-small Screwdriver, Hard-wire Cutters, Large Screwdriver, Medium Screwdriver, Needlenose Pliers, Phillips Screwdriver, Regular Pliers, Scissors, Wire Cutters, Wood/Metal File.  I like the form factor on the Wave better.  Partly because of how the handles on the Pulse are designed, the edges kind of bite into my hand.  6) Leatherman Kick - it is 5.2 0z, .2 oz heavier than Skeletool, apparently cheap, has bigger pliers than the medium sized juice pliers.  Looks like it's discontinued. NO SCISSORS. Like a sideclip, minus medium screwdriver and plus wire stripper  7) Leatherman PST/II or Sideclip - (both 5 oz) from forum ""You could also try and find an older PST/II or Sideclip (my all-time favorite Leatherman tool), they are both the same weight as the Skeletool, yet smaller overall with larger pliers.""  PST/II has more tools than sideclip, looks like the sideclip is larger but less stuff.  Sideclip - 420HC Stainless Steel Clip-point Knife, 8 in | 20 cm Ruler, Bottle Opener, Can Opener, Hard-wire Cutters, Large Screwdriver, Medium Screwdriver, Needlenose Pliers, Phillips Screwdriver, Regular Pliers, Small Screwdriver, Wire Cutters. NO SCISSORS. PST/II - same as sideclip plus the blade is partially serrated, and add Scissors, Wood/Metal File, Diamond-coated File  8) Victorinix Swisstool - slimmer versions - suggested by reddit, good quality, lighter than Wave at least.  Went to the website, I'll have to check it out more later, they have a bunch of 5 oz tools, a bunch of 11 oz tools, and a handful that have no weight listed.  HONORABLE MENTION   Leatherman zrex - is not what I want, but it's a $26 strap cutter/window breaker, looks a lot sturdier than the resqme, should get one for the car  Leatherman krunch - too heavy, but neat, looks like locking vise grip style.  Might be awesome for woodworking.  $116 at country knives  Leatherman Piranha - 1.9 oz - super small and neat, this is one of those flat piece of metal things, $35 at country knives, Open Wrench (English), pretty slick.   1/4"" Hex Bit Driver with Phillips/flat bits, Bottle Opener, Scraper, Box Wrench (Metric)   ",1689,7,0,0,1,1,®

Female horses are made pregnant, and their their urine is harvested. Then mares have the foal, and usually the baby horse is slaughtered and the process starts all over again. Changes are you know someone on this drug... There are plenty of ways to distill the same hormone from non-abusive methods, but it isn't being adopted.

t5_2smsq,Anomander,1354659551,"Because they're literally *overdue*.  They aren't statistics, they are geological events and patterns that are continuously changing the odds we're playing under.    A high-risk fault is like a deck of cards that's going to fuck your shit up when you pull the Q♠.  Every day you live there, you pick a card.    In a traditional statistical arrangement you're going to have 1:52 odds every time you pull a card.    But geology doesn't always work like that.  An area with high earthquake risk (Vancouver Canada, for instance) has an active fault line where two tectonic plates are moving against each other.  Except, they're not always actually moving *at* the fault.  So you have one giant chunk of planet wanting to go one way and another wanting to go the other way, both stuck at the middle and not letting the other past.  Static friction, essentially.  But the plates haven't actually stopped.  They're still exerting several trillion tons of pressure in the direction they want to go, and only the friction at the fault is holding up motion.    Back to the deck of cards: because the plates are continually exerting more and more force at the fault, we *know* that eventually the build-up of force will be sufficient to overcome the friction between the plates, and we'll get an earthquake when they shift against each other.    However, we also know that the pressure doesn't *need* to reach that level before the quake: sometimes the fault slips earlier.    At any given day, there is one set of odds that a quake happens.  But we also know that playing the game over the course of geological time is akin to slowly removing cards that are not our Q♠ from the deck: the odds that there will eventually be an earthquake at any fault approach 1.  It is statistically improbable that there will *not* be a quake on a given fault - if we're watching that fault for billions of years.    The concept of ""overdue"" comes not from Gambler's Fallacy or statistics, but pattern recognition.  Taking the Vancouver example, we have geological and archeological records indicating that our fault builds up tension at a rate that results in an earthquake every 600 years (number made up, can't remember the real one).  Now, last time, it was 400, but before that it was 700, but as we increase data points we see an approximate average of 600 years.    And it's been 650 since the last one.  We know there is a fixed pattern present, and while that pattern does not email us a time &amp; date appointment, it's certainly suggesting that the fault is probably close to enough stored energy to slip.

t5_2rfxx,BabrahamDinkin,1354736834,"&gt; That analogy has numerous flaws. For one, he is not employed by riot. He makes a living off of their platform, but they do not own him.   ~~As a player with Dignitas he is part of Riot's team salary system, thus making Riot technically his employer when it comes to Riot sponsored tournaments.~~ EDIT: It seems clear now that Riot's ban on his participation in Riot sponsored events comes from the fact they did not want such a negative player to sign any contracts with Riot. Use of their platform is also supposed to reflect their values as a company in the competitive scene. They have stated multiple times that those on the pro-scene have a responsibility for leading the community by example.  They do not own him, but they own the game, platform, and sponsor the tournaments, so they are well within their rights to ban him from using or participating in any of the above.  &gt; Secondly it is in no way clear that riot warned IWD that his actions would have consequences beyond that of the normal tribunal.  From Riot's ToS:  ""This system of allowing the Community to review user behavior in the Game is called The Tribunal®. Should The Tribunal determine that you have acted in contravention of any one of the Riot Games policies, **Riot Games may, in its sole and absolute discretion, ban your use of the Game and suspend, terminate and/or delete your Account.**""  Needless to say, being banned from competitive play would most likely fall under the category of banning use of the game. While it is not explicitly clear that they have the right ban people from competitions they themselves sponsor, it is common sense to know that Riot has the power to make that determination.  While it has not been made clear to us that he was warned his participation in competitions would be potentially be at risk, it has not been made clear that he was not a warned about this possibility either. With 8 bans/warnings and actually having your negative behaviour increase by 30% past this point, I personally applaud Riot's decision. I just see it as part of the 0.7% of the most toxic players in North America being banned from tournament play as well as regular public play.   A quote from Lyte as well: ""This was a collaboration between eSports and Player Behavior. eSports had multiple meetings and discussions with relevant parties on both sides before they made a decision on the verdict and the timing.""  Hopefully other pro players will note that even if you are a pro, if you give Riot a bad name, then you can be banned from Riot sponsored tournaments.",8411,52,0,0,1,1,®

t5_2smsq,Anomander,1354759248,"&gt;wouldn't you need a reeeaaally long window of observation,  We do have a few thousand years...    The geological record means we don't need to have been around and watching the whole time, in order to get data from ages ago.    &gt;What I'm meaning is, that predictions based on observed events in the past could collide with predictions made by probability, right?   No... Because where do you think we're getting those probability numbers from?  The probability of earthquake is exactly that: the odds that there will be an earthquake over [time period] based on all the best information we have.  For instance, if there's a lot of little tremors, that's normally a risk sign for a larger earthquake, so the probability increases to reflect the change.  Now, the probability hasn't necessarily changed, but we have more information to calculate it.    Back to cards: I hand you a pack of cards, and ask you what the odds of pulling that Q♠ are.  ""Easy, that's 1:52.  Obviously.""  But if I give you new information, like ""I left the Jokers in"" or ""I took out all the even numbered cards"" or ""There's two Q♠ in there"" you're obliged to change how you calculate the odds.    The odds haven't necessarily changed, you just have better information to calculate them with.    &gt;In that case, which prediction is more reliable?  None.  It's never a *prediction*.  Predictions are absolute statements, and probability is anything but an absolute.  Let's get back to the Gamblers' Fallacy: it statistics were a *prediction* then the Gamblers Fallacy wouldn't be a fallacy at all, because it's been predicted that you *will* hit jackpot every 101 plays on a game with 1:100 odds.  Instead, probability is telling you what odds are that any specific outcome comes to pass.  You having 1:100 odds means you have 1:100 of winning every time you play, but in no way guarantees or predicts one win per 101 plays.    &gt;couldn't the incidents we're basing our predictions on just be anomalies, e.g. you throw a dice ten times and you get (unlikely but could still happen) 5 times a 6,   Sure, I guess.  But we have a lot more information than just a few dice rolls, and statstics has a few things to adequitely deal with this, among them the concept of a ""statistically sound sample size"" which is the number of data points required to run statstical analysis on the results in order to predict what's known as variance and confidence intervals.    Variance being how widely varied the data points contributing to an average are.  Confidence is a mathematically generated score attempting to predict how likely the results you're getting are going to resemble reality.  I'm not pro stats enough to explain the math itself, but it involves breaking down the sample and then analyzing the chunks against one another to try and solve for the effects of outliers on the actual results.    And ... it's possible we have nothing but outliers in our data set, but much like how deciding to avoid the 99999999999:1 game also indicates you should never leave your house again to be consistent, we're better off taking what we have and using as best we can while being open to revising it as we collect more data than charging in blind and uncaring because our data set *might* be composed of nothing but outliers.

Down, sit, heal, etc...makes it easier to learn. 5. Consistency! Everyone in the house uses the same commands and follows the rules. 6. Set boundaries and limitations.

I'm not sure of your age, nor does it matter, it just reminded me of my students wanting everything handed over on a platter.  It seems ""research"" has become synonymous with, ""post on a forum and let someone else figure it out.""    Perhaps starting off with, ""Hey guys, so I was just given this TT, but after a week of searches, all I can find is info on 301's, etc.  Anyone have any experience with this table?  Any resources I may not know about?"" That's what I mean.  Show you've made an effort, then others will be more likely and willing to help.    It's like asking a friend to come over and help fix your car, then sitting in the shade drinking a beer while he does all the work.   I know, sometimes you just want an quick answer, but trust me, you'll learn a hell of a lot more if you search for those answers yourself rather than just asking for handouts.  I have a house full of old gear (including an odd model Garrard) who's details have eluded me, but I just keep searching.  You have to weed through the crap to find the gems, but they're there.

The Type A is quieter and has less flutter due to its heavy platter. Its arm is better, being counterbalanced.  The motor has better hum shielding.   If you are going to stack records (and throughout this reply, I am making this assumption, otherwise why buy a record changer?) the pusher platform is gentler and easier on the records than the center push/drop spindle on the RC121. **The A70 and 70 Mk II (same machine, came in two different model numbers)** is an improvement over the Type A. The tonearm's vertical pivots are closer to record level so there is less flutter generated by up/down movements over record warps.  The arm itself is lower in mass though not ""low"" in present terms; more like ""less high.""  The mechanical bits in the automatic trip mechanism are made of low-mass aluminum and low-friction Delrin® instead of steel and thus the trip mechanism works properly to a substantially lower tracking weight, below 1 gram instead of two grams on the Type A. I use a Garrard A70 with a Stanton 500 in the bedroom system, and play my 78s on it with a change of stylus. Disadvantage to the Type A/A70/70 Mk II: the pusher platform won't move inwards enough to stack seven inch records because the heavy cast platter is ten inches in diameter and would block it.  For 7 inch 45rpm records the LRS 3 large-hole center spindle is needed and is often found as a used item.  But without a platform extender, which is so rare that I have only ever seen ONE, these models cannot play stacked seven inch 78s or 33s, with their small spindles, at all.  The RC88 and 88 Mk II could do it, since they only had a seven-inch steel platter, but you give up the better tonearm and heavy platter. [Source](http://www.lencoheaven.net/forum/index.php?PHPSESSID=d65iv37j6tifi2lc0d1njujud4&amp;topic=3650.msg57204#msg57204)   Interesting... Let's read on!  &gt;The 70 Mk II was the last Garrard to have the famous Garrard-patented pusher platform record changing mechanism. **It is nearly identical to the Type A70 (only the center nameplate, the model number emblem, and a white arrow on the headshell distinguish it from the A70) and is directly descended from the Type A**, which Garrard touted, with great commercial success, as ""the first Automatic Turntable."" By now, all these units are old; the 70 Mk II dates from 1966, the Type A70 from 1964, and the Type A from 1960. Typically, all of these models are prone to a stuck automatic mechanism, caused by the main operating gear/cam freezing to its shaft due to the old grease drying out and hardening. I've found from long experience that it's not all that difficult to fix the problem, by undoing the hex nut that holds the shaft in place on the unit's chassis, heating the gear/cam gently with a small propane torch to soften the hardened grease, and pushing the shaft out the bottom. All the rest of the mechanism stays in place! This allows the dried grease to be cleaned out with solvent. New synthetic grease was used to relubricate the parts before reassembly. There are dozens of other places where old grease needs to be cleaned out, but by comparison they're much easier to do with some of that same solvent and a pile of cotton swabs. Some attention with a needle oiler got some new oil to the motor bearings; I'd see whether the motor would need overhaul later. The center bearing always needs to be checked out on a turntable this old. There was evidence that it had been serviced in the past: out of the original five 3/32"" steel balls in the bearing race, only three were present! It is easy to lose these when servicing the bearing on these models, and apparently somebody had done just that. Fortunately there is a nearby hobby store, selling supplies for building radio-controlled model cars, and they stock those steel balls. It took a half hour to go there, chat with the owner a while, and come home with a little plastic bag containing a dozen 3/32"" steel balls. The idler wheel was in good shape (nobody had let the turntable sit in the ON position while it was unplugged, so no flat spots) and just took a bit of cleaning and a swipe with a rubber drive conditioner. With the platters (the inner steel drive platter and the outer, heavy cast alloy platter) set into place, the moment of truth had come. Powered up and running for probably the first time in decades, the 70 Mk II went through its paces flawlessly. When cold, the speed was about 0.2% fast; when warmed up, it was about 1.2% fast (Garrard's standard was 1% fast to allow for slowdown as a stack of records is played, so this is close enough) so the motor is OK. Tomorrow, I'll listen to some records, with a Stanton 500E. I already use a Garrard Type A70 in my bedroom system (Fisher 800B AM-FM-MPX receiver, Snell K2 loudspeakers), so the 70 Mk II is familiar to me. But it's always a thrill to rescue something like this from decades-old nonoperation, making it as good as it was when it departed the factory in Swindon, Wiltshire, England. Maybe a smidgen better; the modern grease I put in there won't dry out like that old stuff. It is unlikely that the main gear/cam will freeze up again, even after another forty-five years. [Source](http://www.lencoheaven.net/forum/index.php?topic=7289.0)  [This guy would also be a good person to ask](http://www.vinylengine.com/turntable_forum/viewtopic.php?p=293487&amp;sid=fa0b1bdd6652de2dd5e62495cc998801#p293487): &gt;The TYPE A70 was the upgraded Type A and was a much superior unit. Unfortunately Vinyl Engine does not have a service manual for the Type A or Type A70 (or the identical, two-years newer 70 Mk II) in the library. In fact they don't have the owner's manual for the Type A70/70 Mk II. Maybe I should scan mine and send it to them!    [Here's a guy that's rebuilding an A MKII](http://www.vintage-radio.net/forum/showthread.php?t=64247), you can try PM'ing him and pick his brain.  [Here's an interesting tidbit:] (http://www.lencoheaven.net/forum/index.php?topic=3650.msg59842#msg59842) &gt;The idler's rubber may be aged and have hard spots.  Not even turning it and truing the surface will fix that.  Garrard quit making that particular idler wheel in the late 1960s when the **A70 (later, the identical ""70 Mk II"" model)** was discontinued, though supplies of new ones were available for many years.  So I guess that means that the A70 manuals should be able to help you with your MKII.  There's the [service manual for the A70](http://www.vinylengine.com/library/garrard/model-70.shtml), which should at least give you some insight into the proper setup and functionality.  [There's also the Garrard Guide to Automatic Turntables.](http://www.vinylengine.com/library/garrard/garrard-guide.shtml)  [Yet another VE post about your table.](http://www.vinylengine.com/turntable_forum/viewtopic.php?p=118860#p118860)  Well, your 30 minutes are up.    **EDIT: Nice looking table by the way. I've always loved the Garrard's suspension system.  I always wished my SL-95B had the wooden plinth, alas, it's plastic.  It runs a bit fast, but I'm only missing the 7"" automatic feeder.

Where I draw the line is when people directly go after the artists themselves or try and bring their anti-ness to fans. Sure I don't like Fashion King but I'm not going to write Yoo Ah In and tell him he should go die because of it.

t5_2qkli,nozafc,1354974095,"Scotland should be independent  By Alex Salmond, Saturday, December 8, 12:59 AM  The writer is the first minister of Scotland.  When the United Nations was formed at the end of World War II, its membership comprised barely 50 independent countries. Today that number has grown to almost 200 — a sure sign that the right to democratic self-determination has been among the foremost prevailing factors in the world as we have moved into the 21st century.  And the voice of the United States has often been instrumental in that process.  As first minister of Scotland, I lead a country that once was independent and aspires to that status again. In autumn 2014, we will offer the people of Scotland the opportunity to vote to reclaim that independence.  As part of the debate in the run-up to that referendum, it is important that the facts are laid out as clearly as possible, and that is why The Post’s Oct. 31editorial [“If Europe crumbles; An independent Scotland would be bad for the West”] was so disappointing.  To begin with, the assertion that an independent Scotland would “withdraw from NATO” is quite wrong. The Scottish National Party voted this year for an independent Scotland to continue in NATO membership. Independence will certainly mean an end to the stationing of nuclear weapons in Scotland, that is true, but this will merely put Scotland in the same non-nuclear category as 25 of the alliance’s current 28 members.  The claim that an independent Scotland would be “unable to contribute meaningfully to global security” also is untrue. Would the same be said of European nations such as Norway, smaller than Scotland, or Denmark, almost identical in size? As it happens, these two countries combined flew more air sorties in the internationally sanctioned action in Libya than did the United Kingdom.  Further, the assertion that London might veto independent Scottish membership of the European Union and its use of the pound as a currency is not borne out by the facts. The recent Edinburgh Agreement, signed by myself and U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron, commits both our governments to respect the referendum and to implement the outcome, whatever the result.  And it is likely that any London government would be keen to see an independent Scotland continue to use the pound, given the large sums that Scottish sources — not least North Sea oil and gas, the vast majority of which lies in our territorial waters — make to that currency’s balance of payments.  Scotland and the United States share close ties stretching back centuries. Many U.S. presidents trace their ancestry to Scotland, while the Declaration of Arbroath, the 14th-century document asserting Scotland’s status as an independent nation, has been held by a U.S. Senate resolution as a direct influence on the U.S. Declaration of Independence.  The long-standing ties between our two countries will only be strengthened once Scotland regains its place as an equal member of the global family of nations. After all, the Republic of Ireland gained its independence in the 20th century and enjoys the warmest of relationships with the United States. Does anyone in the United States seriously consider that this relationship would be improved by seeing Dublin return to rule from London?  Former president Bill Clinton recently recognized that it is increasingly important for national identities to be accommodated along with the need to make common cause to tackle global problems. Independence in an interdependent world means that the 21st century can see just such a global partnership evolve hand in hand with the political self-determination of which the United States has so often been such a vociferous champion.  Indeed, in considering the true interests of the United States, perhaps The Post would do well to reflect that democracy and self-determination must by their nature represent the real interest of America, because they are the core principles on which the country was founded.  There is something else worth reflecting on in the Scottish civic debate. In a process of self-government that has taken the best part of the last century, not one person has ever died arguing for or against Scottish independence.  The national movement in Scotland is peaceful, democratic and civic in its nature — something perhaps, in this troubled world, to be encouraged as in the true interests of both the United States and of Scotland.

t5_2s7tt,yetkwai,1354979341,"Uh, what are these atheist symbols you speak of? I mean you don't believe in anything, so why would you have symbols?  Religion just sort of gets absorbed into our culture. There's a lot of symbols we use that are derived from now dead pagan religions that we still use. Really, the Christmas tree is one of those. It got absorbed into our culture and then later it got absorbed by Christians from our culture.   Is the heart symbol a religious symbol? Should it be prohibited from all government property? It originated from pagan religions. Not many people believe in those religions any more though. Is saying I ♥ you, a religious statement?  Of course not. No one gives a fuck about that anymore. If someone displays ""I ♥ NY"" in a New York government office, no one thinks of it as displaying a religious symbol in a government office. Even though technically it is. But since no one believes in the religions that held that symbol to have a religious meaning no one cares.  So why do atheists care about symbols of religions they don't believe in being displayed? Nobody cares about a ♥ being displayed because they don't believe in that religion. Why would you care about the symbol of a religion you don't believe in being displayed? Why does it offend?  This sort of behaviour indicates that some atheists aren't simply non-believers, they are actually anti-religion, and more specifically, anti-christian. They care about it only because christians care about it. They don't protest something like I ♥ NY for using a religious symbol because christians don't care about it. They are essentially trolling christians. And then wonder why christians don't like them.",52921,16,0,0,0,1,♥

t5_2qj8f,plurk,1354980754,"&gt;The EnergyMizer® uses a state of the art technology to actively monitor and improve the power usage in your home or business. Our technology reduces active power and Kilowatt demands [...]  So it can make a 800 Watt appliance tun on, say, 600 Watt? I'm no expert, but that seems unlikely if not impossible. &gt;[...] while providing voltage stabilization by storing excess energy.  So it has battery and a (flexible; i.e., able to transform varying voltages to one stable voltage?) transformer. Now I know there's such a thing as voltage spikes, but as far as I know these are not common enough to cause an extra 20% in energy usage. Unless your spiteful neighbour has an EMP gun or lightning strikes within the vicinity of your house for a few hours a day. &gt;For the residential units, simply plug them in, turn them on, and you will begin saving electricity immediately.  No mention on whether the device is placed between your appliances and the outlet, or whether it's simply connected to your electrical circuit. If the former is the case, you'd need a whole bunch of these devices. If the latter is the case, I find it hard to believe it would do anything at all.  Again, I'm no expert.

t5_2qh1u,BioGenx2b,1355034575,"Context is absolutely important here:  ##tl;dr **We royally pissed South Korea the fuck off.**  __________________________ ###♦ Outskirts of Seoul, Morning of June 13th, 2002 ♦  Two schoolgirls walking along a narrow roadside are run over by an American military vehicle during a training exercise. The Status of Forces Agreement defines it as a ""military operation"" and thus puts the case's jurisdiction with American military courts. Two service members involved in the accident are later acquitted of negligent homicide, citing no criminal intent. Families of the deceased are paid civil damages by the American government.  Shortly thereafter, thousands of protestors rally in the streets, demanding that they be re-tried in a Korean court. Months of protests and Washington's subsequent refusal, Korean sentiment declines heavily into anger over American policies giving sole jurisdiction of U.S. military-related crimes on South Korean soil to the United States.  PSY, along with the rest of his country, are in almost unanimous protest against the U.S. Businesses are banning Westerners, U.S. flags placed on the ground in college campuses so that students can walk over them during their commutes. _______________________________________________________  ###♦ Excerpt from Korea Times, December 5, 2002 ♦  `""Following the acquittals of two U.S. soldiers from negligent homicides charges late last month, a growing number of local celebrities have offered their heart-felt sympathy with the victims in public, while expressing their strong resentment over what they see as an unfair ruling by the American military court.`  `These public figures have composed protest songs against America to pitch in their voice, join public rallies, or have gone as far as calling for revision of the Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA), which governs the status of 37,000 American troops stationed here, through official statements.`  `Even though these pop stars have managed to put in their own two cents' worth, pop vocalist PSY, who has upheld the cause since August through many concerts, is among the most outspoken of them all.""`  South Korean protests eventually succeed, as the American military eventually amends SOFA, allowing Korean courts to take U.S. servicemen in custody prior to trial. _______________________________________________________  ###♦ Iraq, May 22, 2004 ♦  The Islamist group Jama'at al-Tawhid wal-Jihad kidnaps Korean Christian missionary Kim Sun-il, ransoming his life in the demand that South Korea cancel plans to send 3,000 more troops to support the U.S. and withdraw their ~900 medics and engineers currently occupying the region. Seoul refuses negotiations and Kim is subsequently beheaded. The video of the act is accompanied by the following statement:  `""Korean citizens, you were warned, your hands were the ones who killed him. Enough lies, enough cheatings. Your soldiers are here not for the sake of Iraqis, but for cursed America.""`  This sparks massive protests throughout the country with thousands rallying against Muslim extremists and Seoul's plans to send troops to Iraq. This public outrage is the perfect environment in which a number of anti-U.S. military protestors seize the momentum to put forth their cause.  PSY, along with several other popular performers, take part in a live performance of K-metal band N.EX.T's song ""Dear American"".  _______________________________________________  *Source*   [Exclusive: PSY`s Anti-America Protesting Past?](http://busanhaps.com/article/exclusive-psys-once-passionate-protesting-past)",114846,34009,0,0,1,1,♦

t5_2qh61,johnbentley,1355065487,"You are getting wrong advice.   Edti: I'm not a Doctor ....  Do not apply any creams (excepting hydrogels such as Burnaid).  The standard treatment is the same for any other burn: 20 minutes of running cold tap (or shower) water. This is effective if applied up to 3 hours after the burn and it will effect considerable reduction in healing times. This treatment is always more effective than hydrogels.  Just be sure not to give yourself hypothermia.   If the burn is really bad then loosely wrapping the burn, after cold water treatment, in cling wrap prevents infection and offers some pain relief (keeping the air off the wound).  Sources: Australian Red Cross First Aid Manual 2010; [Cuttle L &amp; Kimble RM, First aid treatment of burn injuries, 2010](http://www.awma.com.au/journal/1801_01.pdf).  Edit. Cuttle L &amp; Kimble on Aloe Vera (and hydrogels) specifically:  &gt; Aloe vera as either the leaf pulp directly from the plant (Figure 2) or a gel treatment containing the pulp is another commonly applied alternative dressing used by the public for burns. Previously, the published data on trials of Aloe vera treatment suggest that it would possibly be of more benefit for superficial burns, rather than deep burns. That opinion is supported by our research, as we found that that the application of Aloe vera for 20 minutes provided no beneficial healing for deep porcine burns. As most people continually apply Aloe vera pulp for several hours post-burn, it is possible that a longer application may have provided some healing benefit, however the main effect of alternative treatments such as Aloe vera and Burnaid® appears to be their ability to reduce or eliminate pain, rather than improve wound healing.",31555,265,0,0,1,1,®

They are trying to say that the plural should be 'Lego' because the company said not to use 'Legos.' ""See!! It's right there in print."" But the thing that they ignore is that the company told people to refer to them as 'Lego bricks or toys.' The mention of the plural being 'Lego' does not exist from that letter except in crude interpretations of it. The one thing that letter does prove is that the term 'Legos' has been used as the plural for Lego bricks for years decades now as the company recognized it. But what that letter did say was to refer to them as 'Lego bricks and toy', so the real correct plural of the term is 'Lego bricks.'  But like I said, I'd recognize both versions as they are both really not correct in a formal sense of the term, but both seemingly acceptable in informal circles.   edit: Actually I was wrong, the correct plural is actually 'LEGO bricks and toys.'

There's so much intricacy to his clothes, weird elements that somehow go together, also this element of playfulness and whimsy (lol, [Gundam hats](http://www.style.com/slideshows/2011/fashionshows/S2011CTR/GIVENCHY/RUNWAY/01fullscreen.jpg) anyone?) that really does it for me. The gothic/romantic look was something that I was always into, and Tisci makes it look contemporary. I also love reading about his inspirations, somehow it's always art that I already love (Butoh dancing, German expressionism), and then going back to the clothes and identifying all the elements. His haute couture stuff is gorgeous, I would live in that if I could, that being said, somehow I feel it doesn't translate so well to RTW, or rather it's been hit or miss for me. It's hard to explain, but I feel like toning it down loses a bit of the vision.

t5_2qnwb,computerpsych,1355176591,"There is plenty of information on Google about this. I recently found out that Ritalin was not affected by Vitamin C, just Adderall.   **Drugs.com says**  &gt;Avoid drinking fruit juices or taking vitamin C at the same time you take amphetamine and dextroamphetamine. These can make your body absorb less of the medicine. Read more at http://www.drugs.com/mtm/adderall.html#2KVvP2QBuSxkTVss.99   ***  From wikipedia-  &gt; Urinary and stomach pH levels can have a strong effect on DL-amphetamine excretion and absorption.[28] An acidic stomach and GI pH will decrease the absorption of Adderall,[12] and acidic urine levels will decrease the reabsorption of the drug through the renal system.[29] Co-administration of acidic substances (e.g., citric acid) causes decreased renal reabsorption of DL-amphetamine; whereas, alkaline agents (e.g., antacids) may cause a marked increase in renal tubular reabsorption. The increased reabsorption can increase the retention of amphetamines, with potential to result in dangerously high serum levels.[29]  *** **This is from the FDA website (posted in a blog)**  &gt;Drug Interactions:  &gt; **Acidifying agents** -Gastrointestinal acidifying agents (guanethidine, reserpine, glutamic acid HCl, ascorbic acid, etc.) lower absorption of amphetamines.  &gt;**Urinary acidifying agents**-These agents (ammonium chloride, sodium acid phosphate, etc.) increase the concentration of the ionized species of the  amphetamine molecule, thereby increasing urinary excretion. Both groups of agents lower blood levels and efficacy of amphetamines.  &gt;**Alkalinizing agents** -Gastrointestinal alkalinizing agents (sodium bicarbonate, etc.) increase absorption of amphetamines. Co-administration of ADDERALL XR® and gastrointestinal alkalinizing agents, such as antacids, should be avoided. Urinary alkalinizing agents (acetazolamide, some thiazides) increase the concentration of the non-ionized species of the amphetamine molecule, thereby decreasing urinary excretion. Both groups of agents increase blood levels and therefore potentiate the actions of amphetamines  Here is a list of foods containing vitamin C listed on the blog (linked below)  Oranges – juice or fruit Grapefruit – juice or fruit Strawberries Papaya Kiwi fruit Mango Cantaloupe Lemons/lemonade Limes/limeade  Potatoes (this is not a misprint) Brussels sprouts Broccoli Kale Cauliflower (who knew?) Parsley Mustard greens Bell peppers  Source: http://www.addiva.net/2009/06/21/adderall-vitamin-c-interaction/  ***   * Coffee might not affect the absorbtion but it will stack and give people an extra jittery feeling.   * The juice is not the problem. It is the Vitamin C in the juice.   * **You should also avoid drinking pop within 1-2 hours before/after taking Adderall because it can have citric or phosphoric acid.**  * **People taking a multivitamin should take it later in the day instead of morning because these usually have &gt;100% daily vitamin C.**  ***  *I really wish people did more research before posting questions on /r/ADHD and include more information in the OP when asking a question. I am all for helping people, but it seems like people are taking advantage of the helpful members and expecting us to do all the research. This was all new information that I searched for just now.*",10410,212,0,0,1,0,®

t5_2tf60,BolshevikMuppet,1355188245,"&gt;You first said someone would have to stop all piracy to run an experiment which I presume you understand is impossible  If your argument is that piracy has a net positive effect on digital sales, the proper experiment would be to compare purchases with and without piracy.  A need to stop piracy for some period of time for some number of people would be necessary.  Though, then you'd have the problem of not having a blind study.  So, it'd be difficult to quantify it either way.  &gt;proceed to explain to my about why any evidence I give you will fall into one of three categories you have prejudged as not good enough  Prejudice isn't *quite* the right word.  It is meant for someone who has come to a conclusion before being presented evidence.  Given that all of your evidence falls into one of three categories any statistician would say ""yep, that's not good evidence"" to, it's not prejudice to communicate that to you.  &gt;Your premise is founded on equally shaky ground  I have made no claims, only responded to yours.  If your position was ""it has no harm nor any benefit"" I would not be able to quibble (I'd point out that there's a staggering amount of piracy of things like the humble indie bundle, but admit that there's no way to prove they *would have* bought it if they had to).  And if your position was ""we can't know the effect"" I would kiss you on the mouth.  You made the claim it was a benefit, a claim that requires some basis.  &gt;Paraphrasing? Really? After your demand for empirical evidence?   Yes, paraphrasing.  If you doubt that Mr. McCartney actually said it, I'd be happy to find sources for you, but I decided to spend more time writing substantively and less time googling the exact phrasing.  You seem to mistake ""lack of exactness about a quotation"" for ""OMG it's not empirical.""  Here's a tip: anecdotes are not data.  I was giving an example which you (wrongly) quibbled with.  &gt;despite that they made little money they continued to make music  Again, Paul McCartney would quibble:  ""we'd be idiots to say that it isn't a constant inspiration to be making alot of money. It always is, to anyone. I mean, why do big business tycoons stay big business tycoons? It's not because they're inspired at the greatness of big business; they're in it because they're making alot of money at it. We'd be idiots if we pretended we were in it solely for kicks. In the beginning we were, but at the same time we were hoping to make a bit of cash. It's a switch around now, though, from what it used to be. We used to be doing it mainly for kicks and not making alot of money, and now we're making alot of money without too many kicks... except that we happen to like the money we're making.""  (Beatles Ultimate Experience: Playboy Interview With The Beatles. Interviewed by Jean Shepherd in Edinburgh. Copyright © 1965 Playboy Press).  &gt;As an artist and someone that knows hundreds of artists that, while trying to make money never really do but keep making music nevertheless, I can assure you it isn't their bottom line which drives them  And how many of your acquaintances have a big problem with their art being pirated?  If your argument is ""OMG disseminate art"" apparently it doesn't apply to what's being pirated, because most of what's being pirated is created by business.  &gt;A businessman really is about money, whereas, the artist really is about their art.  Your fetishization of the artist as one who works solely for the love of art is defied by almost any artist you can name.  Michelangelo, Leonardo Da Vinci, and Donatello were not starving artists.  They were artists working for their patrons, the Medici.  Are there artists working solely for the joy of creation?  Absolutely.  Is most of the art being pirated made by such people?  No.  &gt;The speculation is that Shakespeare was written by someone who who funded themselves by writing popular plays. Shakespeare wasn't popular commercially, it was art and culture, and became popular much later.  Speculation by whom?  Because that goes against all of the history I've ever read, and I've read quite a bit about Elizabethan England.  &gt;All these things begin with someones single artistic vision  Really?  You believe that one morning Joss Whedon said ""I have a damned good idea for an Avengers movie?""  No.  He was hired to write a script and direct a movie.  And the actors were hired, and the production staff was hired.  That's usually how it goes.  Some really big names can get their pet projects funded, but that's for the James Camerons of the world.  Go survey some filmwriters to see how many get to just write until someone realizes their idea is ""the next big thing"" and how many get paid by studios who have an idea and need a script.  Transformers: Dark of the Moon was not a single artistic vision from an aspiring artiste.  They hired someone to write a script for a movie they were already making.  Pirates of the Caribbean was not an artistic vision, it was Disney deciding to make a movie based on the ride.  The Dark Knight was kind of an artistic vision, but it was the *studio* saying ""hey, would you like to direct this"" which goes against your whole ""it starts with the artist and then goes to the company"" shtick.  &gt;it got shut down because the music industry couldn't compete and could no longer control what people listened to and what they liked thereby  That's not quite what happened.  Even the ""OMG it was awesome for indie artists"" recounting of it on [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MP3.com) explains it quite differently than ""it was destroyed by the evil record labels.""  If you have some source for that, I'd be happy to see it.  &gt;I will, along with many other artists, produce as much free competing content as possible to damage the industry as much as possible  Except that's not piracy.  If your method of destroying the RIAA or MPAA was to make competing content and become more popular, that's fine.  But right now I'm not seeing ""OMG independent artists are bringing them down and taking their profits.""  I'm just seeing piracy.  &gt;since I cannot earn anything I will give it for free in the hope I destroy as much of the industry as possible  So, because your music isn't something people want, you want to make it that no one gets paid for their music?

t5_2qm4e,Criticalist,1355205104,"A number of thoughts come to mind about your assertion. I think you can claim a superficial level of plausibility, in as much that, nothing you say is actually wrong. However, I think the difficulty lies in the fact the system is so complex, that it is possible to find supporting observations for almost any hypothesis.    It’s probably useful to break down what you are suggesting into more manageable bits and look at whether there is supporting evidence.   1. We make too much cortisol when we are older.  Its certainly seems that we make more cortisol as we age, (although saying its “too much” is perhaps a bit loaded) and several studies have shown this (Purnell et al, JCEM 2004 for example).  2. These higher levels of cortisol contribute to mortality. Harder to say. There is a recognised association between higher cortisol levels and cardiovascular mortality, but that doesn’t mean that it is causative – it might be that sicker people have higher cortisol levels because they are sick, not the other way around. There are some plausible mechanisms by which cortisol might lead to heart disease and stroke though, probably related to fat deposition and metabolic syndrome.   3. Removing an adrenal gland will reduce the cortisol levels and thus improve lifespan.  I think this is where you are making the big leap. First, what effect does removing an adrenal gland have on plasma cortisol concentrations? I don’t know of any literature on this, but I don’t believe having only one adrenal has any clinical significance, or any effect on adrenal testing for example. I would strongly suspect that if you removed one gland the other would compensate and bring your cortisol levels up to what they were before, thus making your intervention worthless. However, if it does have an effect, how would you predict it? – what cortisol level would you be aiming for and how would you know if adrenalectomy would achieve it?  Its worth looking at outcomes for people with glucocorticoid deficiency, as by your hypothesis, people with these deficiencies should perhaps live longer. Secondary adrenal insufficiency does not include mineralocorticoid insufficiency, but the data suggests theses people have a higher mortality rate (Tomlinson et al, Lancet 2001). Health related quality of life is also impaired in these people and many of them are on disability pensions. Adjusting the dose does not seem to make much difference (Riedel et al ,Exp Clin Endo 1993) which suggests things are probably a lot more complex than we realise.  I would suspect that one area of complexity would be differential tissue cortisol acitivity. You touched on BHSD activity in your post, and certainly differential regulation of this enzyme system will have profound effects on glucocorticoid activity in different tissues that wont be reflected by plasma levels.   I think overall, one thing we have learned in medicine is that what seem to be simple interventions can have unforeseen outcomes. Cutting out an entire gland is perhaps a bit of big step to take based on speculation, even if it is informed ☺  ",7822,2405,0,0,1,1,☺

t5_2r54y,aim2free,1355221296,"Think about it!  &gt; Is it mandatory for people to be a part of your system where everyone helps each other out?  Today it is mandatory to be part of a system, controlled by others, without ability to help each other out. Take such weird examples as:  1. if you happen to run som kind of weird proprietary licenced software or similar, you neighbor is in need, but you are due to some weird reasons, not formally legal, due to decisions by others, not allowed to help your neighbor.     2. you have a book, movie, drawing, which is out of print, which could help your neighbor, but you are, due to decisions by others, not formally allowed to copy your stuff, which could help your neighbor.     3. You find that you could help your neighbor by combining two different ideas and build a simple device that could help your neigbor, but, due to some nasty patent system, someone may have a patent on both of the smaller ideas you are combining, thus you are not, due to decisions by others, not formally allowed to build such a thing, helping your neighbor.     4. You find some problems with a device you have purchased, implying that it doesn't work as it was expected to do, but, nowadays this important information about the device as drawings, APIs, protocols, etc may be secret, not documented, and it may in some countries, due to an insanely evil invention 1998, DMCA, not even be formally allowed to reverse engineer it, to make it work.     5. You pay tax, don't you? but how your tax is used, is not controlled by you, in formal theory it should, but it doesn't. Like here in Sweden there are 7 billion SEK per year, that are withdrawn from forcibly withdrawn tax, to pay for unnecessary software licences, the only way you can avoid this robbery is to not pay tax.     6. You want to buy a new machine, but as you don't trust evil closed software, you do not want to buy a machine with evil closed proprietary software, as you can never know that the software does what it claims to do. Despite this it is in many countries a forced tax, a social allowance, that forces you to pay a tax to e.g. Microsoft, which in reality is a forced social allowance fee, to enable them to continue exist, to become even stronger in enforcing their taxes.     7. You may grow your own food, but your seed may have been contaminated by some evil entity's seed, which is patented, thus makes you a target, for trials, which may ruin you, and enforce you to sell your farm, due to the legal costs. Monsanto is such an evil entity that tries to control your food, to make you dependent upon them, in a similar way as Microsoft is trying with their infertile software. You are trapped.  &gt; Can he still have his own property, trade freely and not have to pay any taxes?  Remember how it worked once, like for the native Americans. Land-property could not be owned, you could put your living area wherever you wanted. In a similar way it worked for the Europeans that invaded the country, they settled somewhere, and they were free, to trade whatever they wanted, to pay whatever taxes they wanted, to share whatever they wanted. But not for long, then came the land-property owners and destroyed the system, in a similar way as some claim that ideas and creations can be ""owned"" today, thus destroying the system.  When you are free, you can pay whatever taxes you want. If you are smart you realize that if you dont give your other what they need, then others may not give what you need when you need it. This is the simple case for common infrastructure. Everyone that needs it, pay in some sense. The only problem is when someone is allowed to own, this common infra structure, then can steal from you ad infinitum.  &gt; Is human separation a human right and is it a part of liberty?  from my own I consider the separation of human from nature, separation of humans from the possibility to help others, separation of humans by destroying their possibilities to interact in a sane way, robbery of humans upon their huymanity.  The only true right is liberty of your mind, to make up your own mind. To think on your own, take your own decisions, and do not allow other people to control your mind, and, to take the logical consequences of your decisions.  Therefore, do not believe me, if what I'm saying doesn't make logical sense❣  However, as it is hard for everyone to take their own decisions in a complicated world, certain types of infra structure needs to be free, to not impose restrictions upon what you can decide upon in foolishness way  at one time, but which will make you a victim of your own stupidity later.  To that type of infra structure I would denote:  1. freedom of communication and transport.     2. freedom of health care.     3. freedom of education.       Regarding 1, that is fixable with technology, I'm working on.     Regarding 2, that is fixable with technology, others are working on.     Regarding 3, that is already free, apart from in some countries, but the freedom is not as good as it should be.  Check my draft proposal for education [article 26](http://wish-it.se/up/#a26).

This Levi's® jacket is part of our program that minimizes water in the finishing process.**  resin coating... that means it's going to trap the color in. so with that being said, this will most likely NOT wear down as a normal pair of raw denim but i'm sure it'll still look awesome over time and wear. also, if it's had a resin coat then that means it's been through some type of water or wet treatment. resin is applied wet, then baked in a giant oven, then washed/rinsed off. so definitely not raw in this case.",8197,520,0,0,1,1,®

Several creams are available with specific ingredients aimed to combat itch. These include Eurax cream®, E45 anti-itch cream®, Balneum Plus Cream®  and Xepin Cream®.  In addition, antihistamine tablets may be tried. Some antihistamines can cause drowsiness and one needs to avoid driving etc. after they have been taken. However, it tends to be the antihistamines that cause mild sedation such as Atarax® which are the best at helping with itching, especially at night. During the day, a non-sedating antihistamine such as Clarytin® could be tried. People often need to find which antihistamine suits them by trying several different ones. One further treatment which can be used is ultraviolet light therapy. This is only available in hospital dermatology units. Self-treatment with home ultraviolet lamps is not advisable as the overall dose would not be monitored and one could cause lasting damage to the skin. An eight-week course of therapy can sometimes help with itching, although benefits may only be temporary.""  Best wishes to your mom, hope she'll find some relief soon!",92,115,0,0,0,1,®

Fortunately, the old release I'd received from LEGO® Australia right at the very beginning saved me.

He held the gaze of Kaylee’s one remaining eye for a few seconds before slowly, ever so slowly, pushing the poker up towards her nipple. The horror and pain in her face was beautiful. He loved that she knew what was going to happen, and that all of her struggling against them was worthless. Kaylee’s nipple hissed as the hot poker pressed against it, but her broken-toothed scream drowned the noise.

t5_2tvrv,Zombie_Army,1355426100,"**Steam name**: ❄mellow❄  **Awesomenaut name**: Penny &amp; Robro  **Description**: Born on to the famous intergalactic explorers, James and Marsha Sunslayer (not to be confused with the Connecticut Sunslayers), Penny spent most of her life traveling the universe with her parents.  While a life of exploration is high in excitement and adventure, her childhood was mostly lonely.  What friends she did make on her travels, she would quickly abandon when her parents decided to move on to the next system.    Her parents realized the loneliness gripping their daughter (and the constant danger they put her in) and decided to do something about it.  Using materials they had collected from their travels, James built Robro, the perfect robot friend and protector.  Penny and Robro became fast friends.  Robro was always there for Penny to confide in and Penny was constantly tinkering with Robro, making him better and better.  Unfortunately though, while on one of their many adventures, Penny lost contact with her parents.  She tried to track them down, but to no avail.  Moneyless and stranded on an unfamiliar planet, Penny began entering Robro into the local ROBO-FIGHTS.  Thanks to Penny's modifications, Robro became the top robo-fighter on the planet.  The years passed and with no one left to challenge and still no news about her parent's status, Penny was contacted about a new opportunity.  One that could provide a true challenge for Robro and put her in contact with creatures from around the universe.  With the promise of a challenge for Robro and the possibility that one of these new aliens might have information about her missing parents , Penny and Robro left their planet and became the newest members of the Awesomenauts.      **Abilities**:  Bear Hug:  Thanks to the modifications Penny has made over the years, what began as the perfect hug has turned into something more.  Penny can command Robro to Bear Hug.  Robro then dashes forward to squeeze the life out of a target, snaring them in place and doing damage over time.  Hide and Seek:  Turning one of Penny's favorite childhood games into a weapon, Penny commands Robro to go hide, turning him invisible for the duration.  While Robro is invisible, Penny gains truesight (she can see invisible stuff) while Robro becomes temporarily invulnerable, but unable to attack.  At any point, Penny can command Robro to appear, temporarily stunning any enemies near him.  I imagine these characters to behave sort of like the Ice Climbers in SSB.  Unless given a direct command, Robro follows Penny and mirrors her actions. Sorry it's so long, I just got kind of carried away.",11703,908,0,0,1,1,❄

PLANET EARTH – June 28, 2025 – In 2017, an epic battle took place between humans and dangerous insect alien invaders determined to destroy our way of life. Humanity persevered during the war and destroyed the alien Mothership, recovering most of the prosperity it once had. In preparation for another insect onslaught, the mighty Earth Defense Force (EDF) devoted years of research to combat this menace by upgrading their soldier classes, artillery capabilities, vehicles and much more. However, news poured in today, that what humanity feared the most became true. The giant creatures seen in Arizona seven years ago have returned.  The EDF is calling all the citizens of Earth to join together in the fight to battle against the massive upcoming attack in 2013 for the Xbox 360® video game and entertainment system from Microsoft and PlayStation®3 computer entertainment system.

In their minds, The Relationship® somehow existed independently of her and her boyfriend. I have some theories about the origin of this odd viewpoint. But whatever its origin, it seems to cause a lot of trouble for these women. They devote a lot of time to thinking about, discussing, and analyzing abstract ideal of The Relationship® that they sort of forget that their boyfriend is a flesh-and-blood person with feelings. If these women stopped thinking about The Relationship® so much, and just devoted more energy to being nice to their boyfriends, they'd all be much happier. Guys are usually very, very easy to please. But these women have a tendency to complicate things...  edit: formatting typo",9510,8515,0,0,1,1,®

t5_2tz1e,_Trilobite_,1355458167,"Yes. I was 6. Our family took a trip to San Francisco and on the way there we stopped in at some fancy hotel near the ocean cliffs. (This isn't going where you think it's going). There was this park behind the hotel that went all the way to edge of the cliffs. There was a swingset and my brother and I were swinging on it while our parents talked and took pictures of the ocean. I jumped off the swings, and as my brother was at the way back end of his swing I grabbed him and shoved him. He rocketed forward at twice the speed he was already going and flew off at the end. He was in the air for maybe 3 full seconds before landing on his back and getting the wind knocked out of him.   In the moment, I felt badly, but never realized that if he had landed differently he could have actually died.  In terms of *almost* getting killed, my retarded ass friend was playing around with my pellet gun in my garage one day and pointed it at my head. He pulled the trigger jokingly, thinking it wasn't loaded and was on safety. Let's just make this qiuck.  **Gun:**  ☑ Loaded  ☑ Off of safety  ☑ Pointed at my head  Luckily he missed. I almost died of absolute fucking terror.He was so terrified of what happened that he literally just put down the gun and started saying ""Holy fucking shit"" over and over. For maybe 20 seconds after it happened we were both just standing there completely in shock of what the hell (could've) just happened.",87015,53312,0,0,0,1,☑

When I use my fingers for application I almost always use my ring finger. Lighter touch since its not used as much as our pointer.   4) Don't blend too much. You'll know. It'll look like a muddy mess of your darkest colour.   5) if its issues with blending out with your outer 'v' use less dark colour. It's easier to manage.   I hope those few tips help!

Despite the fact that it's basically a scientific anomaly, 3 out of my mom's 5 friends from college that she is still close with 20 years later ended up having infertility issues. One went the IVF route, but two chose adoption and it has been the most amazing blessing for both families. We don't know the background behind one of the girl's life before she became a part of my mom's friend's family, but the other family rescued their daughter from a woman who was a daily meth user and alcoholic. Hell, she even named the kid Alize (you know, after that cheap fruity stuff) because she thought it sounded dignified... Fortunately they changed her name to Allison so they can keep calling her ""Ally"" but the most important thing is that just as much as they rescued Ally, she rescued them. After years of sadness and stress from not being able to achieve their family goals, they were finally able to become parents as they always dreamed of and their home is filled with joy now, for everyone.   You can rest assured knowing that just as much as this was an important step toward your long term happiness, it was for his adoptive family as well. I commend and respect you so much for making such a hugely important decision at such a young age, and I hope that someday *when you're ready* (if you want to, of course!) that you will have your own shot at motherhood.

You might want to drink some broth, and add some mineral salt, to help with the fatigue and headaches (it's usually related to dehydration when starting keto).  I posted this in [another thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/142zze/centrum_specialist_energy_yay_trying_to_increase/c79kk68):  ---  [Centrum Specialist® Energy](http://www.centrum.com/centrum-specialist-energy) contains 40 mg magnesium (Magnesium Oxide) and 80 mg potassium (Potassium Chloride, same as mineral salts), the RDAs are way higher than that.  Mineral|Adequate Intake (mg) |:--|--: Sodium|1500 Potassium|4700 Magnesium|420 Calcium|1000  With keto you might not need the full 4700 mg of potassium, some recommendations are a bit lower at 2500 mg. You excrete more sodium the need for potassium is lower, with a high carb intake a high potassium intake is mostly to balance sodium levels (high insulin levels causes you to retain sodium).  &gt; The diuretic (dehydrating) nature of ketosis causes an excretion of three of the body’s primary electrolytes: sodium, potassium, and magnesium (31,40). These three minerals are involved in many processes in the body, one of which is the regulation of muscle contraction, including the heart.  Some studies show a net loss of calcium while others do not (31).  &gt; To counteract the excretion of minerals on a ketogenic diet, additional mineral intake is  required.  Although exact amounts most vary, suggested amounts for the three primary  electrolytes appear below (26,46):  &gt; Sodium: 3-5 grams in addition to the sodium which occurs in food   Potassium: 1 gram in addition to the 1-1.5 grams of potassium which occur in food   Magnesium: 300 mg    [""The Ketogenic Diet""](http://books.google.se/books?id=JtCZBe-2XVIC&amp;lpg=PA79&amp;ots=dNISh1zQJz&amp;hl=en&amp;pg=PA79#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false) by Lyle McDonald, page 79.  It's probably easier to get nutrients through food, or if you need potassium you can use a mineral salt. Using a mineral salt (like [Morton's Lite Salt](http://www.fatsecret.com/calories-nutrition/morton/lite-salt)) gives you 2500 mg potassium per 10 gram. A 100 grams of Spinach gives you [around 560 mg of potassium](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=spinach+100+gram), a 100 grams of Avocado gives you [about 450 mg of potassium](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=avocado+100+gram), a 100 grams of beef has [about 300 mg](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=beef%20100%20gram).  If you want to supplement potassium look for ""Potassium Citrate"" as that has good absorption rate, [and it's used in some studies as a way to prevent kidney stones](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19911683). In the US the regular potassium supplements are usually limited to ~100 mg, so most of them are practically useless.  Almonds has [289 mg of magnesium per 100 grams](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=almonds 100 grams), Spinach has 79 mg magnesium per 100 grams.

t5_2qh33,emice,1355553053,"I've never seen a pair of Beats or Skullcandy that were worth their selling price. Most people are trying to upgrade the earbuds that came with their portable device, while spending &lt;$50 and remaining unobtrusive for daily use. They get trapped by looking for a name that is marketed as premium.  There are manufacturers that make best in class products at higher price points, like Sennheiser, but at lower price points I start looking elsewhere. This coming from someone who has owned an externally amped pair of HD-580's since the late 90's. I wanted something small like the ear buds that came with my phone, but with better quality sound. I've tried the $20-$40 Sennheiser CX-200 and was unimpressed, and I hear the CX-495 is not much better.  After research and shopping I recently got a pair of ""made in China"" Soundmagic E30 for $38 shipped. I also considered the Meelectronics CW31 for $24. Neither of these headphones are for bass heads but both companies sell other models that trade accuracy for a bit more bass. The CW31 has a warmer sound vs. the E30's greater accuracy and detail, and both are canal phones/in ear monitors, so outside noise/possible danger is blocked. The fact that canal phones completely seal the opening allows them to produce better and louder bass than ear buds. Either of these or their bass heavier cousins (do some research for model #'s) beat the Beats® equivalents costing 2x as much.  If it is top fidelity in a tiny package your after, look into canal phones that use a balanced armature design like the Soundmagic PL50 for &lt;$60. These will sacrifice deep bass, but for mid-range frequencies and up, they are cleaner than the above mentioned phones. Once you get into &gt; $80 range, options really open up for in ear headphones. The Shure SE215 is a good value for $100, and it is doubtful $150 Beats in ear headphones come close to those.",737,1,0,0,1,1,®

t5_2tkk1,blackmarketdolphins,1355579083,"I've been running more Gold matches testing this build. I did several without equipment and a few with equipment, and the results are satisfying. Equipping Adrenaline Mod and Warp Rounds (Phasic will work too, but not as well) is the key to putting him over the top.  Speccing out of S.Net shakes off the chains hold this guy back IMO. You pretty much can bumrush a spawn and with your awesome Vorcha dodge shoot everything in the face (that headshot damage...oh my). Once BL gets bumping and that 15% weapon damage bonus kicks in, you'll be pretty hard to kill and equally deadly. I'm ashamed that I'm liking this build at the moment. It's like playing an Infiltrator but I don't care that you can see me. I feel like yelling ""n0$©oP3iN y@ br@h"" to every Centurion and Collector Captain I see. It's such a silly build, but with a Harrier X, all things are possible.  Nuking spawns points is the most dangerous part since there's a gap in the BL and and when there's nothing (several Combat Engineers and Phantoms took advantage of that), so you can't be too reckless. It's actually turning out pretty well.   ",118341,6002,0,0,1,1,©

Like DDT, we take some time to recognize the dangers of these ""miracle"" advances.  There are many ways to raise crops without it without [damaging your soil](http://www.motherjones.com/tom-philpott/2011/08/monsantos-roundup-herbicide-soil-damage). &gt;The heavy use of Monsanto's Roundup herbicide appears to be causing harmful changes in soil and potentially hindering yields of the genetically modified crops that farmers are cultivating  [It isn't as safe as we were told](http://www.ofa.org.au/papers/glyphosatereview.htm): &gt;Glyphosate is widely used in the mistaken belief that it is harmless, safe and readily breaks down leaving no residues.  [It has been implicated in endocrine disruption too](http://permaculturenews.org/2012/11/01/why-glyphosate-should-be-banned-a-review-of-its-hazards-to-health-and-the-environment/).  &gt;Endocrine disruption may well underlie many of the reproductive, teratogenic, and carcinogenic effects of glyphosate. The synthesis of sex hormones is disrupted by glyphosate and Roundup® in both males and females. Mouse and rat testicular Leydig cells (testosterone producing cells) have reduced testosterone levels as well as increased levels of aromatase, an enzyme complex that converts testosterone into oestrogen [28, 29]. Human placental cells, on the other hand, showed decreased aromatase expression [32]. All these imbalances were observed with concentrations well below agricultural dilutions, and effects were more pronounced with commercial formulations containing adjuvants.",7866,703,0,0,0,0,®

The Elf on the Shelf®: A Christmas Tradition is the very special tool that **helps Santa know who to put on the Naughty** and Nice **list**. This interactive holiday hide-and-seek tradition is perfect for children and families of all ages.  &gt; &gt;The tradition begins when Santa sends his scout elves out to Elf Adoption Centers. Waiting for their families to bring them home, these patient elves hibernate until their family reads The Elf on the Shelf, gives their elf a very special name, and registers their adoption online. Once named, each scout elf will receive its Christmas magic and become a part of the family’s Christmas each and every year.   &gt; &gt;**Excellent listeners and even better observers, these scout elves are the eyes and ears of Santa Claus.** Although they cannot be touched, or else they may lose their magic, **the elf will always listen and relay messages back to Santa.** Taking in all the day-to-day activities around the house, no good deed goes unnoticed; these scout elves take their job seriously.  That is the official description on the website...   less cute..  more... umm... **creepy as fuck.**",36016,4900,0,0,1,1,®

t5_2qh1i,dominusUmbrae,1355612680,"Extensions for browsers These are not covered above so i'm going to give you a long list of the ones i have. COULD OP INCLUDE THESE IN HIS POST? OR COULD THIS POST BE SHARED SOME? i don't want this to be for nothing really. most of these are for chrome, possibly more. and BTW, if your computer is running 4 or less gb of RAM, you could experience slower but better browsing, and a lot of lag sometimes. recommend that if you do close all windows regularly, to stop background processes while chrome is closed - these eat up 1-2 gb RAM.  * Turn off the lights - useful for dimming page elements that aren't flash/video. * Adblock (in addition to adblock plus by the google team, this one allows you to block ads that may appear anyway, by making you select the page element - it'll see it, give you a slider to make the element look good by determining how much it needs to alter the page, and then reloads the page- however, can sometimes block important/useful things when this is implemented- if so, remove the page block and try to ignore the ad (it'll say how many things match the page element you're wanting to block)) * TabJump - allows you to see recently closed tabs and related tabs and frequently used tabs. * Hover zoom - why doesn't everyone have this already? if you're using it, make sure to check out the various options such as browser history and nsfw content. * Wolfram Alpha - type what you want solved into the extension, and it'll pull up a solution in a new tab. Make sure you're using adblock because the ads are annoying. * XMarks bookmarks- only useful if you're constantly switching between browser types and computers. relatively useless otherwise. * TabSplit- splits off all tabs to the right of the current one, not including the current one, into a new window to make things more manageable. * TooManyTabs for chrome - lets you send web pages into a little column much like the way bookmarks work, but this is for people who don't want to fool with bookmarks or who don't want to bookmark the page if they're just going to visit it a few more times instead of constantly. Has less organization than the bookmarks/folders system in chrome. * AppJump app launcher- if the newtab apps page just isn't your thing. * MuteTab- opens a window that takes a few seconds longer than i'd like it to, but it identifies which tabs are playing music and if told to, will attempt to stop/pause the music on a selected tab. NatGeo, i'm talking to you. * Screen Capture - lets you capture a certain part of the screen or the whole page or other things, without having to use printscreen and opening paint and cropping it perfectly and possibly losing image quality. * Google Dictionary - double click a word to search google for definitions. may not work with words that have more than one definition or street definitions/slang. can also (if shown in extensions bar) be clicked and typed into to define something- useful for when the unknown word is part of a link you don't want to click yet. * Look of Disapproval - pastes faces into your chat box, like the following : ಠ_ಠ, ಠ_ರೃ, ಥ_ಥ, ఠ_ఠ, ﴾͡๏̯͡๏﴿, ๏_๏, ಠ▃ಠ, (•‿•), Ծ_Ծ, ¬_¬, ¯(°_o)/¯, (✌ﾟ∀ﾟ)☞, ╚(•⌂•)╝, t(-_-t), t(ツ)_/¯, ◔_◔, ლ(ಠ_ಠლ), (/ﾟДﾟ)/ ; note, at least 3 of these faces came out wrong here. recommend you get the extension and see what they were if they did indeed come out wrong. * Facebook notifications - so you don't need to keep facebook open to get/see notifications. * XBox Live Dashboard beta- if you have and xbox 360 account and receive important messages through xbox live, like your friends asking you to come over or the billing team telling you you've got 1 month left- this also lets you see who's online. * Web of Trust - puts a circle next to any links it can. the greener, the safer; the redder, the worse. trustworthiness, reliability, child safety, and privacy are the determining factors. surprisingly *most* porn sites are still green. :D * Speed tracer by google - not sure what it does or how it's useful but it's got graphs and stuff. some other people may know what these mean and how to use/interpret them; not bad to have even if you don't use it because it doesn't use RAM unless you run it. * Click&amp;Clean - useful for a lot of stuff. sometimes i worry about it though, if it's something that collects info. *note* do NOT get the Hide My Ass extension, it's bad. * FVD free video downloader - downloads basically everything except youtube. * Youtube downloader - this is an Opera web browser extension. all the others have been chrome extensions; if you plan to use this, i recommend you get adblock and ghostery for opera as well. * Better History - chrome. it sorts history and is really good overall. compresses by type and time. lets you search for certain things and delete all of one type or many if you want, or all... * bing wallpaper for google homepage - honestly it's just for shits and giggles. i don't even use the google homepage, just the omnibar in a new tab. Other people seem to use the actual homepage sometimes so it's nice to have. * Cookies - lets you see the browser cookies, what type, etc. may let you delete all of them if you so choose. * Facebook Me-Gusta button - just for shits and giggles. like = me gusta, unlike = ""Don't Want!"", and comment = herpderp. * Hide FB questions - hides facebook questions. pretty damn good at it too, havent seen any in months. (aside from survey  questions) * IE tab for chrome - opens the page in an internet explorer tab. useful for only a few things - 1 : Bitmap image support (.bmp), and 2 : watching videos that require minimum age, like 18+ on youtube, when the chrome version of youtube fucking LOCKS SAFETY MODE ON FOR MONTHS. THANKS CHROME SUPPORT TEAM. I'M ONLY 40 SOMETHING ON MY ACCOUNT. (16 irl, but the videos i'm talking about are from sxephil, sourcefed, and sometimes links from here- so news and reality.) * Magic Actions For Youtube - basically like RES, but YES. lol. * Quicknote - make browser notes quickly and store them. * Reddit companion - 99% of time works to show the link name at the top of the page if you linked from reddit. allows direct sharing to reddit with a couple clicks. * Reddithider - hides stuff after you've rated it. conflicts with default reddit options and if both are running it won't hide anything at all. i'm just too lazy to uninstall this one. * Smooth Scrollerator - scroll smoothly. * Youtube ratings preview - shows ratings preview with the green/red bar in the thumbnail of the video.",11538,687,0,0,1,1,✌

t5_2qh1n,CrackItJack,1355647114,"My personal ""extra"" effort is to flatten cans - tin and AL - and plastic bottles before dropping them in the ♻ bin. When hauling empty cans and containers, you are essentially transporting air.  The transport cost often is the single most expensive item in the recycling process. It can mean the difference between a profitable and a lossy cycle. Since gas prices are going up all the time and recycling collection is paid by municipal taxation, you want the truck to be as heavy as possible on each trip; the content is weighted at the depot and there is a price per ton of material.  BTW this is the main reason why styrofoam (polystyrene) is not recycled in most places - the weight/volume ratio makes it a losing equation ^[source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polystyrene#Recycling).",24023,4895,0,0,1,1,♻

t5_2rxrw,LeifEriksonisawesome,1355699369,"I commented on the behaviors you mentioned as attraction.  &gt; ♂LeifEriksonisawesome  I once got exited because this girl started to exhibit some signs of attraction towards me. However, I was tentative, and noticed that this is how she interacts with the guys she is comfortable with. She, mor likely than not, had entirely plutonic feelings toward me. At least she is more comfortable with me, though. That's a plus. Anyway, point is. It is too damn risky, girls can ask me out more often as far as I am concerned.  Then regarding questions about my love life, things get even more complicated. A girl can be trying to make conversation, i.e. she isn;t saying this to you specifically, or she is trying to gauge interest for a friend( which is great, if the friend could actually be direct.) Or she just may treat you as a plutonic friend, which would be a case of her not wanting you to ask her out. I inquire about my friends love life because it is something which , if they have one, is a good topic of discussion among friends. ' It's a complicated issue.  **Edit: The aforementioned signs of attraction were**  Now beginning to be comfortable with sitting next to me. Greeting me  Touching my arms in conversation. Once or twice shoulder  More comfortable with asking me for help, for a topic in which there are several other guys nearby with the same reputation for aptitude in that area.

t5_2qh13,ThereIsAThingForThat,1355702316,"I don't know if the umbrella unions also include what we call ""Yellow"" unions though. We have ""Red"" unions, those are the ones arranging strikes etc. Yellow unions have lower payments for the members, but they don't have the right to strike etc, so their bargaining power is pretty limited, which is why most of the Yellow unions have lower everything as minimum, which is a pretty big topic in Denmark since the people not paying the Red unions (by going to the Yellow ones) get the benefits of the Red unions anyways.  Actually, the Chevrolet Spark (the car I drive) has an ECOTEC® 1.2L DOHC 4-Cylinder MFI Engine in the US, so you do have 1.2 engines.  But yeah, the insurance is fucking crazy. Because I'm a male under the age of 25, I need to pay the highest insurance payment in Denmark (despite having had a drivers license for 2 years now (minimum age to get a drivers license in Denmark is 18) without having been in any accidents, ever), with Females paying less (which will soon be illegal, thank god). But I could drive my current car (which is in my moms name, costing her ~$70/month), pay ~$300/month for the payment, and get a car that goes an average of 20km per liter (~47mpg if I calculate correctly). If I should have a chance of managing insurance payments, I could get a '97 VW Polo 1,4, costing me ~$3000/year in insurance. Of course, it would cost way more in maintenance, gas (rated at 35mpg instead of the 58 mine is rated at), and that's with liability only, and a copayment of ~$1000. So I have no trouble basically ""cheating"" the insurance company by having it in my parents name.",317140,1828,0,0,1,1,®

I won't go into each one, but I'll gladly find the statistics for gun ownership and homicide rates for whichever one you want to use as a reference and then I will give you additional statistics about other European countries which will show you that an armed populous does not equate to more crime.   Japan: &gt;Of the many reasons suggested by researchers for the high Japanese suicide rate, one of the most startling is weapons control. Japanese scholars Mamon Iga and Kichinosuke Tatai argue that one reason Japan has a suicide problem is that people have little sympathy for (p.39)suicide victims. Iga and Tatai suggest that the lack of sympathy (and hence the lack of social will to deal with a high suicide rate) is based the Japanese' feelings of insecurity and consequent lack of empathy. They trace the lack of empathy to a 'dread of power'. That dread is caused in part by the awareness that a person cannot count on others for help against violence or against authority. In addition, say Iga and Tatai, the dread of power stems from the people being forbidden to possess swords or firearms for self-defense.[122] Stated another way, firearms prohibition is part of a culture that subordinates the individual to society. When the individual finds himself not fitting into social expectations, self-destruction may often seem appropriate, since in a conflict between the individual and society, society is, by definition, always right. It is interesting to note that the overall violent death rates (counting both murders and suicides) in many of the developed countries are approximately the same. America has a high murder rate, but a relatively low suicide rate. Japan and Switzerland have very low murder rates, but suicide rates twice the American level. Seymour Martin Lipset notes the high suicide rates in Japan and western European countries and speculates that 'psychopaths there turn it on themselves'.[123]  &gt;[Copyright © 1993 Asia Pacific Law Review, City Polytechnic of Hong Kong; David B.

t5_2qs6r,nationaltelesystems,1355775598,"UNIVERGE®	SV8000 Series Fulfilling the promise of UNIVERGE®360 It’s all about change And preparing for it Our working environment is rapidly changing, with organizations of all types continually looking for new ways of generating revenue, controlling costs and optimizing productivity. What’s more, the rate of change is accelerating, thanks to the development of new technologies.These advanced technologies provide innovative ways of handling new and increasing commercial and economic demands. Communication and information technology strategies must now be converged across all media types – not just data, but also voice and video. Communication technologies (voice, email, instant messaging, SMS, IP telephony, voicemail, video-conferencing) and their underlying networks such as the Internet, broadband, Wi-Fi and 3G, are the keys that drive many of these new strategies. These are supported by a vast range of desktop, mobile and handheld devices. Although technology is an enabler for organizational improvement, the real challenge facing businesses is to embrace and harness the potential benefits of the technology available. The technology must give practical, easy to use support, and not add extra complexity. It must be available to and used by everyone, not just isolated islands within the business. And it must empower individuals and teams, enabling them to achieve their business objectives. At NEC, we understand these challenges and offer advanced solutions to help businesses meet and surpass their operational and business objectives. We call this holistic approach UNIVERGE360, and it’s designed to efficiently, and cost- effectively prepare organizations for the opportunities available today, and for those of tomorrow. By uniting all business communication devices, (including mobile handsets, PDAs, soft phones and other IP devices) UNIVERGE360 accelerates decision-making and dramatically improves customer responsiveness. And, by bringing together business data through a service-oriented architecture, information is instantly accessed and transformed into real knowledge.The result? You’re truly in the driver’s seat. With UNIVERGE360 you’re in the driver’s seat.  Small, medium and large businesses SV8000 Series Unified Communications Mobility (IP) DECT Voice over WLAN Fixed Mobile Convergence Management &amp; Control Moves-Adds-Changes Expense control Call Accounting Reachability Contact Center Voicemail + IVR Calendar integration Attendant/Operator Microsoft integration Collaboration Presence Messaging The UNIVERGE SV8000 Series from NEC creates new ways of generating revenue and increasing customer responsiveness, while simultaneously improving efficiency and reducing costs. Designed to deliver next-generation, open standards-based solutions, it is your bridge to the future and protects your existing telephone infrastructure investment while providing a migration path to pure IP. With the SV8000 series, all types of communication methods are suppor ted, whether TDM, IP, video, wired or wireless. Connectivity Multiple sites VoIP SIP Migration  Your business benefits Reduce operating costs Converged network The SV8000 Series provides converged communications – data, multimedia and voice over one network, which means just one set of wiring costs. One network also consolidates traffic onto existing circuits, which allows you to leverage bandwidth and software applications. It provides a single, common management system for networked systems, and can reduce long distance/ internal toll charges. Server-based architecture The SV8000 Series includes modular core and optional hardware and software components – all of which are server- based, so it fits seamlessly into your IT environment.The heart of the system is the IP communication server, which is based on a true Client-Server design that does not require the purchase of traditional hardware to support analogue stations or trunk circuits. Central management The SV8000 Series peripheral devices enable you to manage equipment in branch offices from one central location or from any web-enabled workstation.This eliminates the need for local network management staff and therefore reduces the total cost of network ownership. Distributed office A distributed office location environment reduces the operating expenses incurred in managing disparate equipment by consolidating them into one system. Staff can work remotely (on the road or at home) with access to all corporate voice and data resources; all of which means that you can increase your labor pool without the cost of adding office space. Improve business continuity High availability The SV8000 Series offers unparalleled reliability and continues NEC’s reputation for quality. The SV8000 Series is ideal for mission-critical situations such as defense, government and 24hr services. Advanced fault diagnosis, uninterruptible power supply, remote telephony survivability, clustered survivability, and many other fail-over capabilities all ensure the best availability and operational continuity in the industry. Voice quality High voice quality is achieved by optimizing specific functions in hardware and software.The high performance of the line- echo cancellation eliminates echo signals. Quality of Service parameters prioritize voice traffic and, depending on the individual communication channel, the appropriate voice volume level is automatically and centrally managed by the ser ver. Security The SV8000 Series provides secure communications, including voice encryption, a variety of authentication methods, detailed audit logging, data integrity services and bandwidth management services. Increase productivity Fully featured The SV8000 Series gives users access to advanced telephony features that enhance their productivity, in addition to supporting many additional multimedia applications. Value-added applications A rich suite of advanced applications improves efficiency and business processes using voice, email, instant messaging, SMS, IP telephony, voicemail and video-conferencing. Mobility Mobility enables flexible working practices and allows users to work smarter. Collaboration tools will make your employees more productive and more responsive to customers’ inquiries. Wherever users are located, they will be more accessible using IP phones,WLAN and web-based applications. Manage growth Scalable architecture The SV8000 Series incorporates a very scalable, open architecture with almost unlimited networking capabilities: ideal for businesses needing just 25 to 50 lines as well as for those larger corporations that need thousands of lines. In fact, a group of independent SV8000 servers can be networked to handle up to 200,000 extensions.This unique expansion capability is essential in large businesses where geographic, technical and commercial change is continuous and with new offices and departments constantly emerging, growing and integrating. Migration and networking The SV8000 Series can network with your existing NEC and third party systems, so IP technology can be introduced gradually to protect existing investments. Open interfaces The system is also future proof. It uses a state-of-the art open interface so new services and applications can be easily integrated - no matter how fast technology advances. The growing trend Five years ago less than 10% of new telephone lines were IP or IP- enabled. Since then that proportion has grown to 90%. Energy savings Power consumption is less than any conventional enterprise communication platform or PBX system thanks to the SV8000 Series’ state-of-the-art design.  Unified Communications Powerful applications that improve business processes NEC understands that today’s businesses are looking for new ways to manage change more efficiently and retain customers through high quality service.The suite of powerful applications supported by SV8000 Series includes: Expense control suite This fully web-based, modular suite of applications provides call accounting for all your voice calls includingVoIP. You can set budgets for individuals, departments, projects, receive a warning when these are almost exceeded, and automatically restrict service class when a budget is exceeded. Operator communications A PC-based operator console enables your receptionist to provide service that is vastly superior to using an ordinary console. For example, he or she can see and answer priority callers first, see who is on hold, and create multiple queues to differentiate callers.What’s more, for optimum efficiency, he or she can see the extension status before callers are transferred. • Microsoft’s® Office Communications Server (OCS) • Management applications • Personal communications environments • Contact center tools • Voicemail and Unified Messaging • Cost control tools • Advanced operator consoles • IP multimedia softphone • Virtual PC architecture and VoIP Microsoft’s Office Communications Server (OCS) This application seamlessly integrates Microsoft Office with your telephone system. It provides presence awareness within the desktop, which eliminates delays in locating people, who can then communicate in real-time via Instant Messaging, Audio and Web Collaboration as well as video-conferencing. Remote users can also take advantage without requiringVirtual Private Networking. And to keep things safe and secure, all transactions are encr ypted so you can use IM ser vices from MSN, AOL, or Yahoo! In addition to OCS, you can also have full integration with Microsoft Exchange, which provides Unified Messaging and Outlook Voice Access to e-mail inboxes via any phone – the Auto Attendant ensures automatic call routing. Management applications A suite of user-friendly tools for easy communications system management, including configuration, cost reporting, budget control, and security.

t5_2qhfj,eratner15,1355779343,"You could use the game Monopoly to illustrate the economy and its cycles.   From Bridgewater -  In a capitalist economy, cycles of expansions in credit and contractions in credit drive economic cycles and they occur for perfectly logical reasons.  Each sequence is not pre-destined to repeat in exactly the same way nor to take 6 exactly the same amount of time, though the patterns are similar, for logical reasons.  For example,  if you  understand the game of Monopoly®, you can pretty well understand credit and economic cycles.  Early in the game of Monopoly®, people have a lot of cash and few hotels, and it pays to convert cash into hotels.  Those who have more hotels make more money. Seeing this, people tend to convert as much cash as possible into property in order to profit from making other players give them cash.    So as the game progresses, more hotels  are acquired, which creates more need for cash (to pay the bills of landing on someone else’s property with  lots of hotels on it) at the same time as many folks have run down their cash to buy hotels. When they are  caught needing cash, they are forced to sell their hotels at discounted prices.  So early in the game, “property  is king” and later in the game, “cash is king.”  Those who are best at playing the game understand how to hold  the right mix of property and cash, as this right mix changes.   http://www.bwater.com/Uploads/FileManager/research/how-the-economic-machine-works/How-the-Economic-Machine%20Works--A-Template-for-Understanding-What-is-Happening-Now-Ray-Dalio-Bridgewater.pdf",268,14,0,0,0,1,®

t5_2rnve,Azurphax,1355792113,"Quoted from [wisegeek](http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-l3-cache.htm)  ""When a request is made of the system the CPU requires instructions for executing that request. The CPU works many times faster than system RAM, so to cut down on delays, L1 cache has bits of data at the ready that it anticipates will be needed. L1 cache is very small, which allows it to be very fast. If the instructions aren’t present in L1 cache, the CPU checks L2, a slightly larger pool of cache, with a little longer latency. With each cache miss it looks to the next level of cache. L3 cache can be far larger than L1 and L2, and even though it’s also slower, it’s still a lot faster than fetching from RAM.    Assuming the needed instructions are found in L3 cache (a cache hit), bits of data might be evicted from L1 cache to hold the new instructions in case they’re needed again. L3 cache can then remove that line of instructions since it now resides in another cache (referred to as exclusive cache), or it might hang on to a copy (referred to as inclusive cache), depending on the design of the CPU.    For example, in November 2008 AMD® released their quad-core Shanghai chip. Each core has its own L1 and L2 caches, but the cores share a common L3 cache. L3 keeps copies of requested items in case a different core makes a subsequent request.    The architecture for multi-level cache continues to evolve. L1 cache used to be external to the CPU, built into the motherboard, but now both L1 and L2 caches are commonly incorporated into the CPU die. L3 cache has typically been built into the motherboard, but some CPU models are already incorporating L3 cache. The advantage of having on-board cache is that it’s faster, more efficient and less expensive than placing separate cache on the motherboard.    Fetching instructions from cache is faster than calling upon system RAM, and a good cache design greatly improves system performance. Cache design and strategy will be different on various motherboards and CPUs, but **all else being equal, more cache is better**.""    APUs are great, you don't *need* L3 cache necessarily. Just a specialized type, and all else equal more is better, right? Seriously though, like the buildapc bibles say, check dem benches. ..But if you want to get techy...

To add to the “Work” Sportage’s unique demeanor, front and rear wheels display concave rims (more pronounced in the rear), with the rear wheels fitted with new 10.5-inch-wide tires to complete the specialized look.  &gt;Busy professionals will feel at home inside the “Work” Sportage with luxuriously appointed tan leather seats with a diamond stitching design reminiscent of an argyle pattern. High-quality custom carpeting can be found throughout, while door inserts are wrapped with the same diamond-stitched leather and fitted with mesh speaker ports to conceal the upgraded Memphis Audio system speakers for a seamless appearance.  &gt;All business-minded occupants benefit from the latest technology to keep abreast of the latest news updates, including a Motorola Droid X molded into the center console. New iPads are fitted into fiberglass inserts molded into the driver and passenger seatbacks to enable rear passengers to stay on top of pressing work matters, with passengers given the ability to either remove the iPads with a simple button release or keep docked to remain charged. A Bluetooth®5 wireless technology keyboard also is mounted into the back of the center console for easy communications.  &gt;To fully meet all needs of today’s professional male, a full closet and dressing station is fitted nicely within the “Work” Sportage’s spacious cargo area, offering storage for up to two suits, five dress shirts and five belts for any work situation.

Hickey, a criminal psychology professor at California State University at Fresno, said there have been plenty of minority serial killers. In his 1995 book, ""Serial Murderers and Their Victims,"" Hickey wrote that 22 percent of such killers were black. An additional 17 percent were women.  ""It's a stereotype that . . . most serial killers are white,"" Hickey said. ""You ask most experts and they can't name a black serial killer. We have Asians and we have Hispanics that were serial killers. We need to get away from all the myths.""  With a database of 399 serial killers from 1800 to 1995, Hickey found:  (1) 20% of the killers were black. (2) 17% were women.  Serial Murderers and Their Victims Eric Hickey Wadsworth Publishing 1996  With a database of 800 serial killers from the 20th century, Newton found 16% of cases were African-American  Century of Slaughter 1992 Michael Newton  With a database of 558 offenders operating in the United States since 1900, Fox and Levin found:  (1) 86% of the killers are male. (2) 82% are white. (3) 15% are black. (4) 4% are Hispanic.  Extreme Killing: Understanding Serial and Mass Murder James Alan Fox and Jack Levin Crime and Justice, Vol. 23, 1998 (1998), pp. 407-455 Sage Publications 2005  In a sample of 413 serial killers operating in the United States from 1945 to mid-2004, it was found that 90 were African American. Relative to the African American proportion of the population across that time period, African Americans were overrepresented in the ranks of serial killers by a factor of about 2.

A smiley face is not used to mark a minefield.   100. Claymore mines are not filled with yummy candy, and it is wrong to tell new soldiers that they are.   101. I am not allowed to mount a bayonet on a crew-served weapon.   102. Rodents are not entitled to burial with full military honors, even if they are “casualties of war”.   103. My commander is not old enough to have fought in the civil war, and I should stop implying that he did.   104. Vodka, green food coloring, and a “Cool Mint” Listerine® bottle is not a good combination.   105. I am not allowed to bum cigarettes off of anyone under twelve.   106. I may not trade my rifle for any of the following: Cigarettes, booze, sexual favors, Kalishnikovs, Soviet Armored vehicles, small children, or bootleg CD’s.   107. Must not mock command decisions in front of the press.   108. Should not taunt members of the press, even if they are really fat, exceptionally stupid, and working for UPI.   109. I am not authorized to change national policy in Eastern Europe.   110. Never, ever, attempt to correct a Green Beret officer about anything.   111. I am not qualified to operate any US, German, Polish, or Russian Armored vehicles.   112. When saluting a “leg” officer, an appropriate greeting is not “Airborne leads the wa- oh…sorry sir”.   113. There is absolutely no need to emulate the people from “Full Monty” every time I hear the song “Hot Stuff”.   114. I cannot trade my CO to the Russians.   115. I should not speculate on the penis size of anyone who outranks me.   116. Crucifying mice – bad idea.   117. Must not use government equipment to bootleg pornography.   118. Burn pits for classified material are not revel fires – therefore it is wrong to dance naked around them.   119. I cannot arrest children for being rude.   120. An EO briefing is probably not the best place to unveil my newest off color joke.   121. I should not use government resources to “waterproof” dirty magazines.   122. Radioactive material should not be stored in the barracks.   123. I should not teach other soldiers to say offensive and crude things in Albanian, under the guise of teaching them how to say potentially useful phrases.   124. Two drink limit does not mean first and last.   125. Two drink limit does not mean two kinds of drinks.   126. Two drink limit does not mean the drinks can be as large as I like.   127. “No Drinking Of Alcoholic Beverages” does not imply that a Jack Daniel’s ® IV is acceptable.   128. “Shpadoinkle” is not a real word.   129. The Microsoft ® “Dancing Paperclip” is not authorized to countermand any orders.   130. “I’m drunk” is a bad answer to any question posed by my commander.   131. No dancing in the turret. This especially applies in conjunction with rule #113.   132. The loudspeaker system is not a forum to voice my ideas.   133. The loudspeaker system is not to be used to replace the radio.   134. The loudspeaker system is not to be used to broadcast the soundtrack to a porno movie.   135. An order to put polish on my boots means the whole boot.   136. Shouting “Let’s do the village! Let’s do the whole fucking village!” while out on a mission is bad.   137. Should not show up at the front gate wearing part of a Russian uniform, messily drunk.   138. Even if my commander did it.   139. Must not teach interpreters how to make “MRE” bombs.   140. I am not authorized to sell mineral rights.   141. Not allowed to use a broadsword to disprove “The Pen is Mightier than the sword”.   142. “Calvin-Ball” is not authorized PT.   143. I do not need to keep a “range card” by my window.   144. “K-Pot, LBE, and a thin coat of Break-free” is not an authorized uniform.   145. I should not drink three quarts of blue food coloring before a urine test.   146. Nor should I drink three quarts of red food coloring, and scream during the same.   147. I should not threaten suicide with pop rocks and Coke ®.   148. Putting red “Mike and Ike’s” ® into a prescription medicine bottle, and then eating them all in a formation is not funny.   149.

t5_2sdjj,squidgirl,1355977704,"Mmmm... nope. I am an introvert. Always have been. I don't like confrontation. I've found ways around my introversion via my counter-phobic side (used to be very phobic as a teenager and in college). Used to have serious issues with self-esteem and confidence in myself. It's taken me a long time to get to the point that I can debate anyone confidently about anything, and not feel like I'm worthless. These are tendencies that I need to actively work on every day... so I don't become overwhelmed by my anxiety.  For me, less is more. I prefer the traditional Riso/Hudson/Palmer enneagram. I even like what Maitri has to say on the ""spiritual dimension of the enneagram"" because her perspective adds value/depth (despite the spiritual language it is pretty accesible from a more intuitive/feeling direction).   The more I think about it, the more Tritype seems to be reminiscent of MBTI! Enneagram is not just about identifying personality structures... it is about learning your strengths and weaknesses.  We have established here via this discussion that Tritype® is a significantly different system than traditional enneagram (Riso/Hudson/Palmer).   If we continue to allow the discussion of Tritype® in this subreddit... every question from new users will devolve into a debate between the traditional enneagram side and the ""Tritype®"" side. This will limit productive discussions, dilute the purpose of this subreddit and create division between users. This could become very off-putting for new members of this subreddit.  Please don't take this personally, I just want to hear your honest thoughts on this.. Perhaps we could consider a new subreddit just for Tritype discussion...?

t5_2qh1s,gizram84,1356021639,"&gt; Ok then. They store bullets cartridges by holding on to the groove in the brass casing  But you're still missing the point that magazines don't use the groove in the casing at all, clips do however.  I can't believe you're still arguing this.  You're wrong dude.  There are two terms, clips and magazine.  Each term defines a separate device that has separate functions.  Clips and magazines are not interchangeable in any way.  They are separate products for separate functions.  I don't know why we're still arguing over this.  Thanks for the pictures, I'm well aware of what a clips and a mag look like.  I've used both before, many times.  You said that if you cut the size of a magazine off, it would ""look"" like a clip.  I said you're wrong.  &gt;&gt; Colt’s Match Target® line of rifles is a direct descendant of the original Colt M16 supplied to the U.S. Armed Forces  &gt; They call it an assault rifle because it is a converted assault rifle  Of course it is.  You're completely ignoring my my point entirely.  Yes, it looks the same.  Yes, it fires the same round.  Yes, it's the descendant of the M16.  All of that is true, and I don't dispute that.  However, **you are ignoring the *key* difference!**  The real difference is the ability to burst fire.  This is exactly what the media and government tries to confuse.  A machine gun will continue to fire projectiles while the trigger is depressed until it runs out of ammo.  A standard semi-auto rifle will not!  Calling a semi-auto rifle an ""assault rifle"" is purposely trying to confuse the difference between the two and incite fear.  When tragedies like the Newtown shooting happen with regular semi-auto rifles, the media and government throws pictures around and claims they are ""assault rifles"".  People get confused and think that means machine guns.  I would bet you that if you did a survey in America right now, most would think that a machine gun was used to kill those kids.  This is their goal.  They want to confuse the difference between assault rifles and standard rifles to incite fear and gain more support to erode our rights.",77174,7866,0,0,1,1,®

So i made a label that stated ""Retard"" with a handicapped symbol on either side of the word.

I slapped the sticker on the inside of the box over the ""Nugget"" part so on the inside it said ""10 piece Chicken Mc♿Retard♿"" About an hour later, a lady came in, and she was crying.

t5_2fwo,bachmeier,1356059710,"&gt; If that happens you'll be able to just fork it  That doesn't help. It would take a few years to be in a position to fork F# and maybe even mono.  &gt; Look we both know why you came to the conclusion you did.  I stated facts in my post. Any rational person would have drawn the same conclusion. The website doesn't work on Linux. From what I've read, not everything (due to F# being designed for .Net) works on Linux. AFAICT, the Linux implementation isn't the same as the Windows implementation.  I've been studying Standard ML using *ML for the Working Programmer*. It's an excellent book and I've really come to like ML for functional programming. I don't see SML being a practical choice for real world projects. OCaml is, to put it nicely, a bit of a mess to learn. That leaves F#. Mono even has P/Invoke for calling C libraries.   What I see when I look at F# is a language designed by Microsoft for use on Windows. Now there's a push to turn it into an open source, community-led project. The problem is that ""Windows lock-in"" and ""the Microsoft way"" are deeply embedded into the F# community. At the bottom of the screen on tryfsharp.org, you see  ""©2012 Microsoft Corporation."" There's a message stating that it won't work on Linux. A month ago, there was a post here titled, ""Community for F# Online Meetup - ""The F# Foundation""."" I clicked on the link, and it was an MSDN blog, with the message, ""To save time before the meeting, check your system to make sure it is ready to use Microsoft Office Live Meeting"" All the resources out there start with an assumption that you're developing on Windows.  This is very different from disliking Microsoft for their past actions. F# is meant for Windows developers, but yeah, they won't try to stop you if you want to use F# on Linux. The state of F# on Linux is the equivalent of std::vector not being available on a Windows implementation of C++.",3977,1359,0,0,1,1,©

t5_2sumr,simplesteve00,1356074073,"Looks like knife crimes have been increasing at an alarming rate since your gun ban. Not increasing as a number - increasing as a percent of total homicides. There's a big difference. Total homicides have decreased (and population increased) so the rate per 100,000 population has gone down. What's actually happened as gun crimes in total number has decreased and knife murders stayed steady/decreased less quickly - which means as a percent they seem to have jumped - but that's just because gun laws have meant less gun murders.  *I honestly don’t know how fast your population is growing.  First world countries (with the US bing the notable exception tend to grow slowly.  So going from 300 murders a year to 280 murders a year, over a 10 year period doesn't look all that impressive unless your population doubled.*  You guys should really make people fill out a form and prove that they need a knife. You have to be 18 to buy knives and carrying them around without reason is a criminal offence. e.g. chef on the way to a job carrying knives = ok. Person carrying a hunting knife to a cinema = illegal. Out camping? = ok to carry a pocket knife.  *You are making my point for me if anyone is even reading this far into the posts anymore.  This is were we’d be heading with new gun legislation.*    *The idea strikes me that this all may some elaborately constructed argument to disenfranchise anti-gun people from their own movement.*  You did actually have a school shooting. Which was this? Our last mass-shooting was the Port Arthur massacre which was (and still is) one of the largest body counts in the world. That was in 1996 or 97 I think. We haven't had one since. Not to say it won't happen - but the access to semi-autos is far more restricted (sure, there are off the books ones still - but they're dwindling).  *I have access to functioning grenade launchers if I fill out the right forms.  2002 some university student killed 2 of his class mates with a competition pistol.  Hardly a massacre, but it got media attention so the laws for your entire nation were changed.  And you gov’t went to extraordinary measures remove all offending guns from the population.*    Taking my sister's kids to the shooting range is a right of passage. Hey, my dad taught me to shoot. I wouldn't say it's a rite of passage for most people though. You'd generally find that most people haven't even seen a gun outside the ones police carry.  *I’m talking about Americans, as much as the rest of the world thinks they understand us, we do have a culture that is our own that you can’t learn about from just watching our movies.  Some random island somewhere has a right of passage of picking your first coconut or something.  Guns, sex and cars are ours for males.  And you (collectively) do play our video games and match our violent media… so pretty much all you’ve been brainwashed to believe is that guns are killing machines.  This is interestingly something I’ve dealt with on a few occasions; usually when taking a novice shooting.  I hear how they expect the gun to work or what they expect it’s functionality to be… these mirror what they see in video games.*  The line we are arguing over drawing in the United States is a far cry from what you poor bastards did. You've drawn a line? What with? Invisible ink? :)  *A reinstatement of the 90s Assault Gun Ban has been floating around in the House for years.  That's the line we are fighting over.  Numerous national polls, regular ink ☺*  The anti-gun people will probably be very happy with a Clinton Assault Weapon type ban. It's still rubbish - semi-autos are the problem. Shooting guns is still fun without needing to bang off rapid fire. I realise there's a dopamine kick that comes from rapid fire guns - but shit, it's really not a big deal.  *How do you know?  When you you need a follow up shot for hunting?  How likely is the first round going to be when facing an attacker?  It you only needed one, then your cops would probably be carrying around single shot weapons.  I’m betting they don’t.  It’s not anymore of a rush to an experienced shooter than driving a car.  People who get an increased pulse and breathing rate are not accurate.*  Us gun-nuts think the laws are already too strict; we don't want to give anything 'cause nothing scares us more than turning into... well, Australia. Is that because you think guns are illegal here? Because they're not. Shit, you can also get semi-autos if you really don't mind the paperwork and regularly attending a gun club..  Strangely enough though we have access to guns and a fraction of the death count. You have to secure your guns - but really, that's just basics of gun safety and it should be enforced by law.  *When you have to justify why you have a gun to the authorities, it’s a privilege, not a right.  Seeing as even rimfires require justification in your country, I would say you do not have the right to a firearm.*  Americans move here and think it's an issue, then they see that it's actually no big deal and you don't have the ""what if they've got a gun"" thing sitting in the back of your mind.  *I bet a 90lb woman walking through an alley at night doesn’t feel all that secure.  Her attacker didn’t have his right to be three times her size made illegal.*    *An assault rifle is overkill for someone shooting up kindergarteners.  He could have accomplished the same outcome with a crossbow.  Or a school bus.  I get that people in the cities of Australia decided that people living in rural areas didn’t need to have access to guns.  If you can make your own risk of getting murdered go down by 5%, then hell, why not trample the lifestyle of someone you don’t even know.  We are a Republic; part of that means that majority doesn’t rule… the rights of the few cannot be destroyed by the 51%ers.  Every political battle in the US right now centers around this very concept.  At the end of the day, any new laws will end up in front of the supreme court who doesn’t consider popular opinion.  Only our founding principals (as interpreted from either their own liberal or conservative bias).  Chicago tried to ban guns, the Supreme court said, no.*  *The rest of the western world has decided to legislate themselves to safety.  That’s how the bad guys take over.  That’s not made up or a fantasy.  Basically what your country has done is traded 5% of additional personal safety for 20% higher likelihood of tyranny.  Maybe your likelihood of tyranny is extremely low, because Aussies are so much smarter and better than North Koreans.  Fine by me, that’s your choice to believe that way.  I don’t.*   *I'm glad to hear that for once Americans are being tolerant while living in a backwards culture :)*",282,209,0,0,1,1,☺

Title: Amygdala activity contributes to the dissociative effect of cannabis on pain perception. Authors: Michael C.

When a structure becomes active and does not change when looking at the brain in fMRI (with only 12 subjects) which this article is suggesting of other pain related areas, such as those in the PAG and spinothalamic tract, it does not mean that the information conveyed is the same. That is, normal structures involved in the processing of pain can stay active, but these structures now process and transmit different information when THC (or whatever cannabinoid receptor agonist they used) is on board.   I'd like to see the full-text and not a sensationalized media paper, partly because the article linked from the title mentions the anterior-mid cingulate, but the title of the peer-reviewed paper mentions the amygdala.

t5_2qht0,petemillersteakho,1356131784,"**Your analysis is full of lies and speculation.**    Lawyer here. I spent a few years doing criminal defense. Let's go through this! Officer said I am searching your car. I said, ""No, I do not consent to any searches."" The smell of marijuana is probable cause for one to be searched; either your body, your car, or your house. He said he smelled weed so he proceeded to search my car. You should have insisted on a warrant. Always insist on a warrant. Do not give in, ever. Make them get a warrant.   **1. This is your first mistake.  If the police ask to search your private property you can say yes, no, or not answer.  In my case I said no.  However since they had probable cause, the smell of trees, it didn’t matter if I consented.  Make them get a warrant?  I was pulled over and I said, “I do not consent to any searches.”  There was nothing more I could do.  Since they already had probable cause, they didn’t need a warrant.  They just searched my car anyway.  You are completely wrong about asking for a warrant. The cops don't care if you ask for a warrant, they will search you anyway.**  After the officer found the marijuanas, I told him to look at my signed and current doctor's recommendation. He found the note, read it, and then arrested me. He didn't verify if it was real. He didn't call his supervisor. He said concentrated cannabis is a felony regardless. None of that matters. They usually have the lab test it anyway. By the way, what you see on TV and in the movies is usually pure bullshit.  **2. They didn’t lab test anything in my case.  You are completely wrong when you say, “they usually have the lab test it.”  It didn’t happen in my case.  You provide no proof, only speculation.**     The next month was pretty intense. In order to save money I decided to represent myself. I am not an attorney. I spoke to 8 different lawyers. I sat down with 4 different lawyers. I tried to get the ACLU to represent me. (They did not). I was told by the public defenders what I should do. You get a free public defender. EVERYONE gets a FREE public defender. What were you thinking? That you have the knowledge and skills to represent yourself? Nope. I don't care how smart you are, if you don't have experience in the legal field, you're a complete and utter fucking idiot. If you were on an airplane, could you pilot it because you ""are smart enough to figure things out""? Nope. You'll kill yourself. Even after law school, it takes 2-3 years to figure out how everything works.  **3. Public defenders are not free.  Mark Carillo, a public defender that works at Burbank courthouse told me so.  He was the one who helped me gather my defense.  You are completely wrong about public defenders being free.  Please provide proof of your claim.  If you don’t believe me please call Burbank courthouse,  and ask for the public defender's office.  They are not free.  You will find that you do not know what you’re talking about and you have lied here.  In fact, a google search will explain that CA public defenders are not free and a post-court hearing in front of a judge will decide how much you pay.  I was able to get free advice from the public defender and not pay their fee.  Care to provide proof that public defenders are free in CA?  You cannot because you lied.**   Don't give us any BS about how public defenders aren't any good. Most are excellent lawyers who work long hours for little pay. Plus they know everyone in the DA's office, which is where the deals are made. Further, PD's don't just plea people out. If you want a trial, you get a trial. If the PD refuses to go to trial, go to the court and request a new PD. Plus the court will kick the PD's ass for refusing to go to trial. The PD works for you and has to fully represent you. Also, the ACLU rarely gets involved in criminal cases. I'm sure they told you to get a PD, right? And you didn't. and the prosecutor dropped all 4 charges. It was a plea deal so in order to get the charges dropped I had to agree to forfeit all seized evidence. No, they did not drop the charges. They dropped the jail time, etc. in exchange for a felony plea bargain! You plead out to a felony. You are a complete and utter dumbfuck.   **4. They dropped all 4 charges.  I did not plead guilty.  Prosecutor said I must agree to forfeit the marijuana in order to have all charges dropped.  I got all 4 charges dropped on my own.  NO COURT FEES, NO JAIL TIME, NO GUILTY PLEA.  ALL 4 CHARGES DROPPED.  DOES IT SOUND LIKE I’M DUMB?**   Seriously. That sounds harsh, because it is. Pleading out to a felony without being represented is like trying to remove your gallbladder by yourself.   **5.  Your gallbladder analogy is absurd.  Self gallbladder surgery can lead to death.  Not really an appropriate analogy when all I had to do was walk into the courthouse with a notarized doctor’s letter and all 4 charges were dropped.**     This is monumental, epic stupidity. I feel sorry for you. But this is what happens when you think you can handle it yourself. I was left with a ridiculous $1000 bill from the bail bondsman, a $300 impound fee for my car, and a felony arrest record which will follow me for the rest of my life. And I feel I've done nothing wrong. You were completely wrong to think you could DIY this. You had a FREE LAWYER who probably would have disposed of this with a few motions. At worst, you could have explained all this to a jury,   **6.  A suspect does not go before a jury unless he pleads not guilty and goes to trial.  Since I never pleaded guilty or went to trial, I never spoke to a jury.  This is the part that makes me think you are not a lawyer.  My case never moved past the arraignment.  It was dropped.  They had no case on me.**     though the DA would have probably dropped it. You are guilty of being stupid. You are also guilty of letting the DA's office manipulate you so they can pimp their conviction rate.    **7. Again, I was not convicted only charged.**   You know they keep track of that, right? They love to get their stats up. So they told you that it would all go away and there will be no jail, etc. if you just sign here. And you did. That was the worst possible thing you could have done. I made a complaint to the Burbank watch commander because I believed it was an illegal stop, illegal search, and illegal arrest. The watch commander cleared the officer of any wrongdoing. The Burbank watch commander even told me, ""I encourage our officers to make these kinds of arrests."" I was speechless. He mentioned that he wouldn't want any kids trying concentrated cannabis. Again, you did the completely wrong thing.   **8.  I believed the officer pulled me over for doing nothing wrong.  It was very important for me to make a complaint with the watch commander.  I did not, “do the completely wrong thing. “**   Filing complaints does not change your conviction or get it thrown out.  **9. True but it can get a bad cop off the street ☺**   Again, you should have used a PD who could have gone over the facts and used them to defend you. Again, it was really stupid to think you could handle it yourself. the only thing I have learned from this whole mess is to *NEVER SPEAK TO THE POLICE. No. The lesson you desperately need to learn is that you shouldn't try to do things you have no experience doing. I recently went to the optometrist. You know why? Because I don't have the skills or training to do it myself. I trust him, as a professional. If your car's engine throws a rod, take it to a mechanic. If you don't feel well, go to a doctor. If you have a legal problem, go to a lawyer. If you don't use a professional when you need one, then you get what you deserve. Though you don't tell us, I'd wager that all eight attorneys, the ACLU and the court encouraged you to use a PD. Right? You were probably told to get a PD a dozen times and you did not.   **10. 2 of the 8 lawyers I spoke to were public defenders who worked at Burbank courthouse.  The public defenders told me what to do to gather my defense.  Nobody needed to ""go through the facts"" as you say because the case never went past arraignment**   Your ego caused you to turn down free legal work and got you a felony conviction   **11.  Again, I was not convicted only charged.**    and you don't seem to have the least bit of awareness of that. Think that over. You might have gotten the whole thing thrown out but for you thinking that you could handle something you had zero training or experience in. Sorry, no sympathy here. You fucked yourself over, even after being repeatedly warned not to.  **12.  Warned?  Do you have any proof of this?**   Finally, I realize that a harsh tone attracts downvotes. I'm hard on the OP because he really did fuck up. If you find yourself in a bad legal situation, get a pro. Otherwise, you'll suffer for it.   **13.  I am smart, hardworking, great at public speaking, and very familiar with criminal courtroom procedure.  Please explain how defending myself hurt me.  I saved myself money, got all 4 charges dropped, learned a lot, and feel proud for defending myself.  Please explain what a public defender would have done for me that I didn't do myself.  I worked with the public defenders by my side taking their advice.  I didn't fuck anything up** ",36,4,0,0,1,1,☺

t5_2sfmf,RabidRaccoon,1356132680,"I think the problem in the US is not enough guns. If some of the teachers and students had been armed at the school one of them would have shot that asshole shooter in the back.   http://news.investors.com/ibd-editorials-on-the-right/122012-637844-mass-killers-deterred-by-gun-owners.htm  &gt; Luckily, some years ago, two famed economists, William Landes at the University of Chicago and John Lott at Yale, conducted a massive study of multiple victim public shootings in America from 1977 to 1995 to see how various legal changes affected their frequency and death toll. &gt; &gt; Landes and Lott examined many of the very policies being proposed right now in response to the Connecticut massacre: waiting periods and background checks for guns, the death penalty and increased penalties for committing a crime with a gun. &gt; &gt; None of these policies had any effect on the frequency of, or carnage from, multiple-victim shootings. (I note that they did not look at reforming our lax mental health laws, presumably because the ACLU is working to keep dangerous nuts on the street in all 50 states.) &gt; &gt; Only one public policy has ever been shown to reduce the death rate from such crimes: concealed-carry laws. &gt; &gt; Their study controlled for age, sex, race, unemployment, retirement, poverty rates, state population, murder arrest rates, violent crime rates, and on and on. The effect of concealed-carry laws in deterring mass public shootings was even greater than the impact of such laws on the murder rate generally. &gt; &gt; Someone planning to commit a single murder in a concealed-carry state only has to weigh the odds of one person being armed. But a criminal planning to commit murder in a public place has to worry that anyone in the entire area might have a gun. &gt; &gt; You will notice that most multiple-victim shootings occur in ""gun free zones"" — even within states that have concealed-carry laws: public schools, churches, Sikh temples, post offices, the movie theater in Colorado where James Holmes committed mass murder, and the Portland, Ore., mall where a nut started gunning down shoppers a few weeks ago. Guns were banned in all these places. Mass killers may be crazy, but they're not stupid. &gt; &gt; If the deterrent effect of concealed-carry laws seems surprising to you, that's because the media hide stories of armed citizens stopping mass shooters. At the Portland shooting, for example, no explanation was given for the amazing fact that the assailant managed to kill only two people in the mall during the busy Christmas season.  Here's the abstract of the paper  http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=161637  &gt; Abstract:       &gt; &gt; Few events obtain the same instant worldwide news coverage as multiple victim public shootings. These crimes allow us to study the alternative methods used to kill a large number of people (e.g., shootings versus bombings), marginal deterrence and the severity of the crime, substitutability of penalties, private versus public methods of deterrence and incapacitation, and whether attacks produce copycats. Yet, economists have not studied this phenomenon. Our results are surprising and dramatic. While arrest or conviction rates and the death penalty reduce normal murder rates, our results find that the only policy factor to influence multiple victim public shootings is the passage of concealed handgun laws. We explain why public shootings are more sensitive than other violent crimes to concealed handguns, why the laws reduce both the number of shootings as well as their severity, and why other penalties like executions have differential deterrent effects depending upon the type of murder.   We don't need no government to protect us. We need concealed carry laws and lightweight firearms people can carry at all times. They could even be disposable like cigarette lighters and around the weight of a cellphone. The details would be left to the private sector. The government's job would be to allow concealed carry as part of Federal Law. Indeed the US Constitution could be amended to clarify that 2nd Amendment means a right to concealed carry as the Founding Fathers could quite possibly have intended, had they been aware of the inciteful paper by Landes and Lott.   The purpose of firearms legislation is to create fear in the mind of potential criminals. Fear of being shot in the back by a pissed off primary school teacher with a Louis Vuitton Microgun 4000 by Heckler and Koch® in her fucking handbag.",96653,10647,0,0,1,1,®

I like that this item is full sized but it might have to be re-gifted because the smell is just so sweet)  [Pura Botanica all natural hand creme](http://puraproducts.com/bath-body/lend-a-hand-creme-smoother#.UNT0x2_ecuM) - $14.00 (this item I liked and is also full sized, I can see me using this up quickly)  [Lucy B tinted lip balm in Ruby Red](http://www.lucybcosmetics.com/shop.php?code=TB5002p) - $18.00 (Thank goodness the tint is subtle, as I do not do bright red lips, it is an ok formula, not the smoothest, but I will definitely use it)  [La Fresh ECO-BEAUTY® Healthy Hand Sanitizer, 12 Packets](http://lafreshgroup.com/eco-beauty/eco-beauty-packet-singles/healthy-hand-sanitizer-packets.html) - $4.99 (well technically I will be using these... but not exactly exciting).

t5_2s7cl,follicleartist,1356135566,"Reading this and your last post almost had me in tears, mostly mad tears, because I was once married to a shitty guy who did something similar (fortunately no children involved on either side, though). He was cheating on me with his boss at work and basically forced me to move back home across the country. Of course as soon as I left he made promises to move back to TX to make our marriage work, but that never happened. Long story longer haha, sorry...anywho!  All I can really say is do you think you could ever trust him again, like you once did?  You seem to have a strong minded head on your shoulders to make the best choices for yourself and bebe!

t5_2sfmf,RabidRaccoon,1356136477,"&gt; This directly addresses the idea that what we need is more armed people everywhere - schools, churches, Little League games, and so on. A police officer with a standard side arm was no match for an untrained teen with a rifle. People with concealed carry permits may be able to arm themselves against other people with concealed weapons. They will not be able to stop a Sandy Hook or Columbine or Aurora style gunman with a rifle and body armor (none at Columbine, yes at the others).  I dunno. If all the primary school teachers blazed away with Louis Vuitton Microgun 4000s by Heckler and Koch® one of them is bound to get lucky with a head or leg shot. Also the 4000 would have H&amp;K ballistics and hyper velocity lightweight projectiles that would go through body armour, unlike other Personal Protection Appliances.   Another option would be a explosively formed penetrator weapon.   E.g. look at this  http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=AKdFCsycYm8#t=2m55s  Look at the range the jet from the EFP can fire through air. It looks like you can make a scaled down version which fired a jet or superfluid copper that would penetrate body armour from a distance of ten feet or so.  If the shooters started wearing body armour, Louis Vuitton would license this explosively formed penetrator technology for the Microgun 5000 by Textron.",96653,10647,0,0,1,1,®

Edit: the dose of ivermectin is not strong enough to kill heartworm, considering if you give a dog a 51-100 lb tab and the dog is 10 lbs, it won't hurt the dog. We have seen many cases like this at the hospital I work at. The dosage range of ivermectin in Heartgard has a very large buffer zone.   Please keep in mind that I am NOT suggesting giving a small dog a tablet dosed for a large dog. Just explaining my position.

t5_2rxrw,DarkSideOTheMoon,1356234279,"&gt;Putting that aside, how would you feel dating a man who feels nothing?    It depends on the man. The only man I have ever encountered, let alone heard of, who feels nothing ~ is you.  So, I will address this to you personally, because I do believe and feel that there is ***something*_inside**.  I would be happy to date you because I find you fascinating. So, I would go out on a date or several, to get to know this new type of creature I have met and learn more, gulp to satisfy my curiosity. Try to understand... *connect* Maybe we would become ""friends""... maybe remain loosely in touch... *shrugs* It would depend on what you and I gleaned as we got to know each other and inter-related; engaged in mutually satisfying time together, etc.   I notice you use the word ""feel"" various times. I have the impression that it is like explaining colour to a person who only sees black and white; or dimensions to one who only sees two planes. How can I truly communicate feeling to you, something you are totally unfamiliar with, using only words?? I wish I could clasp your forearm gently, look deep into your eyes as I speak... so you hear me, see me, my body language, feel my warmth, my breath, the vibration of my voice and being... .  Oh, how I would try... it brings tears to my eyes as I write this... just *feeling* how I would try to *connect* with you, find that other frequency, some chink in the chain-mail... It is so important to me to (be able to) receive feedback from the other person. Over time, I would adapt, but initially at least I would require a lot of input / data from you explaining things... um... would you *feel* bored or irritated by a bombardment of questions?? I could tone it down, but if I got no other feedback from you... well, I can barely believe this is possible.   So... these are words... (*what do they mean to you?*)   I would feel... disconcerted. I would feel, I would *feel* ...desperately perhaps try to feel *you* / from you. Then I would adapt...  I would look at you as a real live ""Data"" who is physically human but has no desire to feel so (whereas curiously the Star Trek android did).  I cannot accurately imagine how things might progress further unless I met you / a man like you face to face.   What I can say is that I am happy being single and choose to live alone. I am open to a relationship but I choose not to co-habit, though I am happy to spend some time at each other's homes. Among other things, an ability (for my partner) to be able *feel* at a number of levels (and the more acutely / finely the better) is very important to me. Consequently, I would not pursue a romantic relationship with you.    However, in the hypothetical scenario that I had to live with someone, I would choose you or a person like you over their opposite, even if the latter were in a far milder form. Meaning; people who are drama addicts, negative, energy absorbing, etc. are very damaging to me. Even smaller traits and nuances can be toxic to me over time, let alone deeper ones. Dealing with other people's emotional fields and energy is something that can be draining, time consuming and ~ quite frankly, if you are totally ""neutral"" and can possibly be geared into at least verbalising things positively... then that is preferable to someone with (great) feeling but (emotive) dissonance.    &gt;If not dating, how would you feel in general?   I would consider friendship... I would really have to get to know you, but I don't consider your lack of emotion a ""handicap"" to being a friend; it depends on other factors.   Some questions for you, as and when you'd like to reply:   * Do you have a sense of loyalty and if so, on what is it based?  * Does anything ""bother"" you?  * Do you have preferred chores around the home?  * Have any of your pupils ever incited a trace of emotion or feeling within you?  * Do you seemingly have more ""patience"" with children, i.e. you do not get to *feel* impatient / annoyed?  * How do animals respond to you / you to them?  * Do you have good / bad days?  * Tell me something about your dreams...   Have you got any questions for me?  I can continue on how I feel about you in general but I would prefer some feedback from you, on how I am communicating with you&gt; I need to try and tune in...

t5_2qzzs,hashimoto222,1356278942,"10 years ago I had the same diagnosis, at the same time I was initially diagnosed with Hashimoto's, i was also diagnosed with Vitiligo (Micheal Jackson type skin whitening), and Jaundice (Gilbert Syndrome-unknown liver dysfunction). I also suffered from frequent migraines.   The Dr's were concerned that I had some larger global autoimmune disorder, and my Endocrinologist, and nutritionist, recommended I adopt a gluten free, high immune support type diet. I initially used Metagenics UltraInflamX®, and Ultra Clear Plus with some vitamin supplements (fish oils, migraine stuff, etc...), and followed Metagenics diet recommendations for the first 6-9 months. My life was slowly transformed. For 2 years my Dr's kept telling my they thought my thyroid would fail within six months, and I would need Synthetic Thyroid, but it never failed. It eventually fully recovered, and for 7 years my bloodwork has shown no more degraded thyroid function, and my migraine headaches greatly decreased from 5-10/month to less then 1/month. My liver function also greatly improved, I no longer have yellow eyes and skin (I radicially altered my migraine regime-much less drugs), and the skin whitening never extended beyond my armpits and groin. I also went from 230, pounds back down to 170 pounds once off Gluten, and my migraine medications.   I would recommend investigating and pursuing a completely gluten free lifestyle. Autoimmune disorders (not just Celiacs) can be caused by wheat gluten. Since that time I am entirely gluten free and mostly eat paleo, and no longer use the supplements, but they were a great way to start the path to being completely gluten free, and ultimately low-carb/paleo. Eventually I was diagnosed with diabetes as well, and since then I have been gluten free and low carb/paleo, the diabetes was greatly helped by a low carb/paleo diet, I spent 9 months on various diabetes medications, but since going low carb my diabetes is completely under control using diet only. Sadly a traumatic brain injury has undone the positive effects on my migraines and I now suffer chronic migraines.   Being gluten Free, and paleo  go hand in hand, and have made and kept me much healthier and free of further complications from my 3 autoimmune disorders Hashimoto's, Vitiligo, and Diabete's. My liver function has also been greatly improved and currently shows no ill effects from my Gilbert syndrome.  ",9,1,0,0,1,1,®

It's complete BS, because my tactical approach doesn't change, but unless the stars align, you can get screwed over so hard, that it isn't even funny, actually it isn't even *fun to play..*    I'm currently in the late game, most of my veteran troops have died and only my badass sniper with like 170 kills saves the day. The majority of replacements simply die to random BS _or_ because they don't have enough perks&amp;aim to survive just 1-2 turns of sectopods or a group of elite mutons.    I think that's my biggest complaint about the game, because in the old games it didn't matter if half your squad dies, you simply replace them and through tactics and decent gear, even rookies will do okay. Not so Enemy Unknown, if high ranked squad members die, the difficulty skyrockets, advanced gear doesn't matter because the noobs can't hit shit, made worse by the RNG *and* the fact that those heavy enemies have a built in to-hit-penalty (because ♥♥♥♥ you).    As a example one of my last missions..a water map with nothing but shitty cover against *two* sectopods (which ALWAYS spawned right next to each other), at least 6 red elite mutons, a couple green mutons and a ethereal (of which the majority wouldn't leave their small UFO). How are you even supposed to have a *chance* without max lvl soldiers or getting lucky with spawns, so you can reliably snipe them.    It's one thing thing to make aliens overpowered in the early game, it's BS if they remain OP even with the best gear and easily kill of 2-3 members in one turn, what's even worse is..you're **supposed** to flank them, but if you accidentally add another group while trying to do that..its game over..so you can stick to shitty cover and *hope* that your guys don't get screwed by the RNG or *hope* that your sniper has a shot..    Worst part is, in order to start the final mission I have to grind at least one PSI-soldier, but how am I supposed to do that when my guys still die like flies and it's simply to risky to try funky PSI-stuff in all these missions that only spawn heavy elite enemies anymore..    It's just a joke and I think I should just uninstall this unbalanced piece of crap and go back to *real* tactical turn based games, that are fair and revolve around strategy..Enemy Unknown is fun for like 30 minutes, until you reach another of those impossible missions..a game shouldn't be THAT unbalanced, it shouldn't be harder or even MORE random, than terror from the deep (which I actually liked a lot), but they managed to achieve both and these massive design flaws simply ruin any fun, that you could have with the game..    I appreciate that they tried to bring the genre and xcom back, but I can't get over the fact that they haven't even released ONE patch to fix some of the bugs and severe balance issues..",15500,345,0,0,1,1,♥

Guys who act in all of the feminist-approved ways they claim to want men to act to be attracted to those men, but don't make their pussies wet because they're not physically attracted to them. So they try to rationalize it instead of just being honest because that would expose the ""male gaze/objectification"" rhetoric they use as a bludgeon as completely bogus since women also tend to choose men based on what they look like rather than their glowing personality or whatever bullshit you might commonly hear. This is all obvious to anyone who is at least a bit observant.

t5_2qi4s,bipolar_sky_fairy,1356370275,"The author has some good points.    1) Make it a ""used universe"" again, per Lucas's own original take on Star Wars. Dents, dings, scratches, scuffs, dirt, blast points, little personal touches. Make it look FUNCTIONAL, not shiny and pretty. People live in this universe.. there isn't someone following behind with a spray bottle of Windex and Speeder Shine®.    2) Yes, you need to have some comic relief in the film.. in the original Star Wars, that's what 3PO and R2 were for, and they did it through their interactions and their observations of the humans they travelled with. They didn't engage in slapstick, or lame puns... they did it by reacting to the situations they found themselves in in their own unique way.  Do not create poop/fart/burp joke characters, or cartoon rabbits or whatever else.  Humor doesn't need to be childish, just funny and accessible to a number of ages.    3) Epic battles mean NOTHING without emotional resonance. Unless we care about the characters, placing them in danger will have zero effect.  Build them up, write them well, and make the stakes high. Make them lose every so often so they (and by extension us) know they CAN. That makes the ultimate victory (or loss) payoff feel real.    4) Don't make a movie for children. Just don't. Make a movie that appeals to adults.. but that *children can also enjoy*. Don't talk down to them. Talk UP to them. Let them experience adults in adult situations running adult risks that will force them to think about what's going on just a little bit to understand it. Creating great adult characters means the kids will want to BE them. No kid wanted to be Anakin when he was 8 years old on Tatooine in The Phantom Menace, nor did they want to be Jar Jar. Nobody. They wanted to be Luke Skywalker, or Han, or Princess Leia or Obi Wan, or any of the adults (even if poorly written).  Do that, and you'll have reclaimed the legacy of Star Wars.

t5_2s7tt,horrorfetish,1356477121,"As someone who deals with depression and anxiety on a daily basis, and has been on and off medication for quite a few years, you have all my love and support. People get really angry at people when they hear about an attempted suicide, (and I do as well, when they endanger or involve others in their attempt, ie death by police) but most people haven't been there. Most people don't understand that you aren't in the right state of mind and when you make that decision it's not because you're a coward or an asshole, it's because you don't feel any self worth, or that your life is never going to get better.  Logically we know it is, and when we stop to think we know there are lots of people that love us but we don't always feel that way in depression.   One of my good online friends spent a long time after his coming out as transgendered being depressed. He was one of the most generous and kind and loving people I had ever known, and yet all he ever thought of himself was that he was a burden on people, and that he had no right to be alive. He attempted suicide many times, wanting to relieve his sister and his mother of the the supposed burden. He was so grateful for his loving friends and family, but at the same time felt he was nigh-on abusing them because of simply existing. He wasn't selfish, and he wasn't a coward. He truly did not believe he had any worth.  Several months ago (going on a year now...) he disappeared. I think about him every day - his online personas, his website, his galleries are all gone. All I have left are a few drawings he did for me, and one he mailed to me, which I keep close to my heart. I was only ever angry at him once, and I felt like throwing that drawing out to spite him for being gone, for maybe even killing himself. But then I remembered he didn't do it to hurt us, he did it because he was hurting, that he was afraid, and he believed he wasn't worth shit.  But he was worth so much to so many people. The only people who know what happened to him are his sister and mother and father. I hope, every day that he went and sought help, and happened to leave the internet as a form of therapy, and not...well, went through with it. Eirik, if you're out there, we all still love you, and we hope you're well, and we will never forget our wonderful, talented friend.  Oops, and now I'm crying... and that turned into a lot of catharsis. So uh, thankyou op, for allowing me to get that off my chest. If you ever need the same of someone else, especially someone who's been there, I don't know you, and I'm a stranger, but I'm willing to listen. Sometimes that's all you need... not someone who'll tell you you shouldn't do it or that you're worth so much- just someone who you can get it all out to. That's what helped me.  ♥",24235,3182,0,0,1,1,♥

t5_2r9tk,Hiskitten,1356488683,"Hi there! i'm submissive, and can help out.  First and foremost: *there is nothing wrong with you*. If you can process that statement above everything else, you'll be fine. ☺  For me, it's more than just the physical (i'm talking about pain - degradation isn't my thing personally - more in a bit). To me, it's *submitting* to it. i came to enjoy physical pain because associated with it is the idea that i am subjected to whatever He wants me to take. After the first experience of being spanked, i began to crave the pain; it represented, for me, the ways in which i could demonstrate my total surrender to Him. And then, as i began to crave more of it (both in frequency and degree), i began to experience the release of endorphins that had me in another state of mind. At the beginning, i was self-conscious, processing too much in a cerebral way (""how should i be reacting? Should i cry? Why am i not crying?"") and it took away from the experience. But then, as He went deeper into the physical pain with me, i let go. i began to absorb the physical sensations and move *with* them, not trying to intellectualize or analyze too much. And tears came when i was relaxed enough to cry (that may not make sense now but it will as you venture further).  As for degradation...i don't like that, personally, but i do enjoy sensual humiliation. That, in essence, is the stripping away of my defenses so i am laid bare to Him in every metaphysical way. Some of the things i've experienced were statements, such as after a spanking, an intense one, He'd drawl, ""I think she LIKES have her ass reddened over My knee,"" or ""What would your friends say if they knew you were just whimpering and moaning as I spanked your bare ass?"" He'd play with my self-awareness and that would deepen my self-awareness as a submissive.  He would have me sit with my skirt raised and my behind bare when we'd go out (in the car, in a restaurant) but always discreetly (He wasn't into publicly embarrassing me). Then He'd draw my attention to it, and make me blush furiously.   Why did i enjoy that? Because once again, it made me feel so utterly subjected to anything and everything i had signed on to experience at His hand.   Giving up control is a really hard thing to do if you're not used to it; but if handled sensitively, built up (the way it was with me) and then enhanced and increased, it turns into an extremely sensual and extremely exhilarating experience.  There is an intimacy in submitting one's body and mind to Another for His/Her pleasure. And when there is trust, that intimacy is enabled. Without trust, that won't happen.  So maybe all of this is to say that for me, personally, it is the fact that my trust was put into the hands of Another and whatever He did to my body, with my mind, made me that much more *His*.  There are those who are just into pain, not submission. You might want to ask about that, it might be what you're looking for.  But as a submissive in my heart, it boils down to trust, intimacy, and the excitement of never knowing what He would do next, with my body or my mind.   One experience to relate: we were at a tourist attraction, filled with families. He went to the water fountain to drink. One of the things He'd instilled in me was the fact that i had to ask His permission to drink. So when He bent over the fountain, i got sassy and said, ""Yes, You may drink."" He didn't even touch the water. He got That Look in His eyes and stood up again. He went to a bench and sat down on it, motioning for me to follow. He took the position He'd always take when He was going to put me over His knee. my heart stopped but i followed Him. He took my wrist...and sat me on His lap instead. He looked me right in the eyes and said, ""Sassing Me? I'll deal with you later.""   That moment...not knowing if He was really going to smack my ass, that had me frozen and excited all at the same time. Because i could trust Him and i knew that whatever He did, He wouldn't publicly embarass me. But...did i *really* know? That experience increased my vulnerability and i loved it. To this day, even though we aren't together anymore, i still love it. Because i felt more submissive than ever before.  i hope this long-winded reply helps you...i'm around if you need more clarification.   You're not alone. This community came through for me when my Master dumped me in the summertime. And though i felt alone, i had people to turn to and it helped my initial shock to at least talk about it. ☺",392,1,0,0,0,0,☺

t5_2qjvn,RedditAntelope,1356500467,"Buckle up..... it's time or another Antelope Breakdown ®. :P It seems to me that this is only complicated because of your expectations. You want things to be rational with his family, but you don't control his parents: their behavior and most importantly, their *thoughts*, are out of your hands. But let's take a rational look at this.... here are some observations that you may do well to remind yourself of as you try to move forward.....  &gt; My SO and I are both 28 and we have been dating over 2.5 years. Living together for one year.  Sounds good so far......  &gt; I have not been around them where they did not criticize him, me, or our decisions. They have said some incredibly mean and hurtful things.   Obviously, based on how you describe the lives you guys lead, endless criticism sounds out of line. But I'll continue.  __________This doesn't appear to have anything to do with YOU, it seems to be between your BF and his parents____________  &gt;-When they disapproved of one of his last gfs.....he .....started acting the same way he is acting with me... implying that he does this when he ""has something to hide.""  &gt;My SO has already told me that.... While they have supported him plenty, they have also pulled this shit too many times.   &gt; ....when he tries to communicate things with them, they just pretend they can't hear, and somehow turn it around on him.   Really, THIS is what stood out for me from the rest of your post. Your BF and his parents have some baggage, to put it mildly. It's great that you two have a good relationship, but their relationship is not so good and evidently hasn't been for awhile.  THEY have a problem (your BF and his parents) with their relationship and his parents' response to it, seems to be to blame you for it (and him).   &gt; I have tried speaking on my own behalf......They do not accept ANYTHING I say. Talking to them has proven fruitless.  ***Technically, it's not about you.*** Accepting their garbage as coming from a rational place, is a MISTAKE. What they've said is not really about you. That's why speaking rationally to them won't help. They don't see YOU. They see a person they've fabricated in their minds..... a construct that only exists so that they think there is something they can do to improve their relationship with their son...... *something other than examining their own behavior*.  Know that you can't deal with people rationally when they're coming at you like this. Even if you have a rational argument, they're so bent on living in denial about the consequences of their behavior towards their son, that they're going to ignore anything you can bring up which might prove them wrong. They are skilled at performing the mental gymnastics necessary to keep certain illusions together in their own minds.  I almost broke down all the little things they said that are utter garbage, but honestly, you've already done a great job of doing that. You just need to REMIND YOURSELF of what you're written here. I'd recommend that you do so CONSTANTLY because the mind-job his parents is putting on you is wreaking massive havoc on you. You shouldn't let it. But I guess there is a reason you're letting it get to you......  ___________Conclusion, TL;DR, etc._______________  &gt; So thats it. I can either choose to keep trying with these people.... or I can tell him that I'm OK with him cutting them off completely (something he is more than happy to do). But I feel like those are both losing situations.   &gt; Is breaking up a terribly selfish thing to do when my actual relationship with my SO is good? I love him and care for him very much.   &gt; .....I cannot ask him to stop speaking to his family, but at the same time, I cannot deal with them anymore.   &gt; I'm so tired reddit. I don't know how to be supportive and sane anymore and I'm extremely wary of telling my SO that it is time to cut them off. I'm afraid that is a drastic step, one which cannot easily be undone. And because he also has a little sister, its not just cutting off from his parents, but his sister too, and that is harder.  I think a new way of looking at this would serve you better than the way you're looking at it now.  You can't deal rationally with these people. They have issues with their children and you don't exist to them except as some Excuse for why they don't have a good relationship with their son.   It doesn't sound so much as if it's even your choice whether or not he speaks to his family? It sounds like you're the one who's holding on trying to salvage something good out of this? Am I reading that right? I'd recommend that he seeks out therapy, personally. (If he could drag his parents there too, all the better, but they probably wouldn't go.) But overall, it's HIS choice. Not yours. So I don't quite get why you're putting yourself through so much pain over whether or not you tell him you're okay with his decision. He sounds like he's kind of made it? Just support him.   If they won't work things out in a constructive way and won't go to therapy....... then cutting them off remains the only healthy thing to do. Of course it's not black and white. I'm sure they've done good things but at this point, he's grown up and the negative things are holding his life back. (And your relationship.)  Breaking up with him.....doesn't make sense. Unless you have another reason for doing so that you haven't outlined.   **TL;DR: You can't talk rationally to his parents. Don't bother. They're not even treating you as a real person. They're seeing you as an excuse for why they don't have a good relationship with their son, instead of taking a hard look at their own responsibilities/actions/etc. I'd recommend cutting off contact with them, but really, it's mainly his choice..... you can support him, though. (Assuming that they won't/can't all go to therapy or otherwise try to mend fences constructively.)**",3790,50,0,0,0,1,®

t5_mouw,highguy420,1356537823,"It is also what makes [your urine test at five times the safe drinking water levels for glyphosate \(Round-Up®\)](http://www.ithaka-journal.net/herbizide-im-urin?lang=en) from eating those same chemicals.  I've never heard unsafe levels of compost ending up in our foods.  I'm not against chemicals, but let's test them thoroughly to ensure they are not dangerous to humans.  It's taken us more than 40 years to determine that glyphosate herbicides can cause reproductive harm and users should employ respiratory filtration when applying it (among other risks vehemently attacked by the producers of the chemical).  The problem is that our risk assessment is based on lethal toxicity, which is far too simple a metric by which to determine if a substance is safe for contact or consumption by a human.    We have discovered so many chemical compounds so quickly that we haven't had enough time to find out that lead is a terrible substance to build our water pipes out of.  It is a human condition to assume something is safe until your entire village dies of cancer because that pretty dust you found is actually radioactive.  I could go on, there are countless examples of the phenomenon.  We have not overcome that aspect of our human mentality, and should implement practices intended to protect us from our own overly trusting nature.  I use chemicals every day.  Some of them are man-made, but most are natural.  For example I have an aquaponic garden in which I allow bacteria to convert ammonia-based fish waste into nitrites, and then nitrates that the plants can consume.  I use hydroxylic acid under pressure to treat aphids and hydrogen peroxide to treat mold.  When my plants need it I add other compounds to the nutrient solution including chelated iron or boron.    Chemicals are great, but let's use them as necessary, and as we determine they are safe.  For example many broad-leafed plants can be killed by the application of chelated iron to the soil in higher than normal concentrations, therefore I find it absurd to continue to use a strong chemical like glyphosate which requires significant rehabilitation of the soil to restore normal biological function necessary to sustain healthy life of plants (studies have shown increased propensity towards diseases in subsequent plantings after application of glyphosate herbicides) when a safe chemical compound such as chelated iron can be used in its place.    Chemicals are like the cheat-codes of nature.  Sure, they cut right to the chase and brute-force whatever you want, but the resulting side-effects are often much worse than the problem we were solving.  Allowing worms and bacteria to generate compost may not be as simple as synthesizing or isolating a chemical compound and then spraying it in great quantities on your plants to get them to grow, but there are nearly no health-related side-effects associated with using composted biological matter as a fertilizer.  Phosphate-based fertilizers often contain lead 210 and pulonium 210, both are known carcenogens and have been shown to migrate into plant tissue.    The problem these caustic and harmful chemicals solve is how international corporations can make money the fastest.  They will convince you to throw your uneaten food and carbon-based waste into the trash can and instead pay for them to extract fertilizer from petroleum sources to grow new food.  There is no way that sort of excess is sustainable.  The ""modern"" way of life is quite ""modern"" but it is not sane, nor rational.  There is no way we can continue to throw away perfectly good resources and continue to mine new resources to replace them.    From the compost heap to materials such as metals and plastics, everything we are throwing into the landfill necessitates more mining, more refining, more manufacturing and more wealth transferred from consumers to the corporations that have grown to unbelievable sizes, larger that most countries, in their wealth and their scope of influence.  We must stop thinking about nature from a ""we are humans, we pummel nature into compliance with our wishes"" and actually apply some logic and rationality to the entire situation.  It is not a ""chemicals versus nature"" line as they would want us to take sides along, but rather a dispute regarding the rational use and application of chemicals, when other methods have failed.  Not simply for your bottom line, but in a sustainable manner that does not promote excess waste production to sustain.  It's not even an ethical or moral question, it is simply that we cannot afford, as a planet, to continue the wasteful mismanagement of resources and misapplication of caustic and toxic substances.

t5_2s7tt,mkglass,1356542613,"While I might agree with you in reference to a fairly strict adherence to English language construction, I must ultimately disagree.  LEGO is a brand, and is most definitely not a noun.  It's more correct to call it an adjective.  They are LEGO bricks, or parts.  Specific collections of bricks are called LEGO sets.  But this is the English language, which is fluid and changing all of the time.  We mold it to our usage as we see fit, and if enough people use the changes, it becomes part of our lexicon.  If you don't believe me, text your friends about the usage of ""text"" as a verb, and how awesome your Nikes are.  LEGO put a notice on their website a while back (which I believe is no longer there -- I leave it to the reader to verify) stating:  &gt; Please always refer to our products as “LEGO bricks or toys” and not “LEGOS.” By doing so, you will be helping to protect and preserve a brand of which we are very proud, and that stands for quality the world over  Many of you may look at this as the deciding factor in this argument.  If you are writing a book on LEGO, or an article in a magazine, I would agree with you.  However, this is a company trying to protect its brand.  They have no jurisdiction over the use of the English language in everyday conversation.  ""Legos"" is used widely enough to be accepted by most people.  And because the entire purpose of language is to use words to convey a thought, as long as you picture LEGO^® Bricks in your head when I say ""Legos,"" mission accomplished.  Besides... are you going to tell THAT kid the proper usage of the term LEGO?

t5_2cneq,ShellOilNigeria,1356546122,"&gt; In civilian training, the NRA continues to be the leader in firearms education. Over 55,000 Certified Instructors now train about 750,000 gun owners a year. Courses are available in basic rifle, pistol, shotgun, muzzleloading firearms, personal protection, and even ammunition reloading. Additionally, nearly 2,800 Certified Coaches are specially trained to work with young competitive shooters. Since the establishment of the lifesaving Eddie Eagle® Gun Safety Program in 1988, more than 21 million pre-kindergarten to sixth grade children have learned that if they see a firearm in an unsupervised situation, they should ""STOP. DON'T TOUCH. LEAVE THE AREA. TELL AN ADULT."" Over the past seven years, Refuse To Be A Victim® seminars have helped more than 15,000 men and women develop their own personal safety plan using common sense strategies.  &gt;In 1990, NRA made a dramatic move to ensure that the financial support for firearms-related activities would be available now and for future generations. Establishing the NRA Foundation, a 501 (c) (3) tax-exempt organization, provided a means to raise millions of dollars to fund gun safety and educational projects of benefit to the general public. Contributions to the Foundation are tax-deductible and benefit a variety of American constituencies, including youths, women, hunters, competitive shooters, gun collectors, law enforcement agents and persons with physical disabilities.  &gt;While widely recognized today as a major political force and as America's foremost defender of Second Amendment rights, the NRA has, since its inception, been the premier firearms education organization in the world. But our successes would not be possible without the tireless efforts and countless hours of service our nearly four million members have given to champion Second Amendment rights and support NRA programs. As former Clinton spokesman George Stephanopoulos said, ""Let me make one small vote for the NRA. They're good citizens. They call their Congressmen. They write. They vote. They contribute. And they get what they want over time.""  http://www.nra.org/aboutus.aspx",341347,193727,0,0,1,1,®

t5_2soy6,aazav,1356575153,"Fine.  Here's your incidental evidence.  I lived through this.  I lived in a house where things moved without us asking them to.  I, my father, my friend and a repairman in the house all  - saw things move in front of them - felt someone touching them when there was no one in the room - saw a gray floating shape in front of them for several seconds that quickly disappeared.  I lived there for a year.    The recounting of my life in a haunted house on Wing Lake Rd. in Birmingham/Bloomfield Michigan.  © Alex Zavatone 1999  The address is on Wing Lake Rd in Birmingham/Bloomfield Township, Mich.  First or second house on the right when entering Wing Lake Rd from the south.  With a gravel driveway, the house was painted yellow when I lived there in 1982.  At that time, I was a sophomore in HS, about 14 or 15, didn't drink, do drugs and was a normal 15 year old kid.  The first night my family lived in the house, all the lights went out in the house except in the garage below the small attic and the attic.  The door to the small attic would slowly open with a creak and then within a minute, slam shut.  Often, when in the house and after standing still, I would get a feeling like someone cold was walking up behind me and putting their hand right over my shoulder.  Quickly turning around would make the feeling go away then it would settle in again.  Like someone was right behind you and you turn around and they are not there.  When eating dinner, the sound of someone bouncing a ball would be heard over our heads.  Like when you drop a ping pong ball and it quickly speeds up its bouncing but this would go over several minutes.  Twice when entering the garage, a large rusty 3 inch nail fell out of a nailless, stucco ceiling, leveled out and zipped in front of me, hitting the garage divider, bouncing off a box and hit the floor with a ping.  Then it disappeared.  This happened to me twice and to my father once, but he was able to pick up the nail. The amazing thing was that the nail took exactly the same path both times it happened to me.  There was no hole in the ceiling left by the nail either.  A pattern was developing that only these things would happen to men, not women.  I never figured out why until after I had moved out of the house.  We had a yard man who lived in Wayne or Pontiac, Mich and was recently unemployed from one of the car companies.  Curious, I asked him if he noticed anything funny happening to him in the house.  He denied any odd happenings until he was painting the room to the small attic and the radio station changed on him while he was listening to it.  After this experience, he informed my mother that when we had any house work he'd call us, and not to call him.  After a while he calmed down but was pretty shook up.  Twice while sleeping, odd things happened in my room.  The first was reminiscent of the old Pepto Bismol commercials where the man in the commercial would bulge and wobble due to his discomfort.  One night, I woke up in the middle of the night and saw my closet doors doing this.  Realizing that there was nothing I could do to change it, I closed my eyes and went back to sleep.  That to me, is a very strange reaction and after we left the house, we wondered if we were insane to live there for a year.  The second incident was a simple ""there is someone walking in my room"".  I could hear footsteps and boards creaking as if someone was entering my room.  There were no depressions in the carpet and only 3 audible steps were taken into my room.  Again, I just went back to sleep.  While playing on the lake ice with my friend Quigley and his dog, we decided to play at my house.  I warned him that it was haunted but we'd make the best of it.  When we approached the house, it took some effort to get the dog into the front yard but a taunting with a tennis ball eventually got the critter onto the grass.  Finally able to grab the dog, we took him off the grass and onto the front porch where he fought against us strongly.  From there, Kevin took the dog by the collar and I opened the front door.  His dog froze, looked up the staircase inside, whimpered, backed off the foundation taking us with him and almost dragged us off the lawn.  We couldn't hold on and the dog just stayed in the street, never coming close to the house or the lawn.  Baffled and not seeing any spectres, Kevin and I entered the house and got cookies.  After the cookie break, we went upstairs and as adolescents started wrestling and beating each other up.  While wrestling about the room, we fell on my solid pine bed and the bed snapped in half.  Now, I had that bed for 12 years and it had taken a beating but it could have just broken.  Kind of embarrassed, we both went downstairs and Kevin left with his dog.  I had another friend named Justin who had a beer can collection like I did.  I kept mine in the small attic and therefore did not go there much.  Knowing that if I invited Justin over, the ghost would pay more attention to someone new, I told him about the haunted house and we went over to check out my beer can collection.  Justin reacted rather well for the first ten minutes except that I didn't have ten minutes of beer cans to see.  He often got a surprised look on his face and tried to brush something off his shoulder.  Three times I asked him if he wanted to leave until he strongly told me that he would tell me when he wanted to go.  He just walked back and forth between the same racks looking at the same cans.  3  minutes later, he asked to leave.  Going down the stairs, I asked him if he felt the ghost touching his back.  Abruptly, he turned to me and without answering my question, told me never, EVER to take him back to that room again.  Years later, I described to him exactly what happened to him (that feeling from paragraph 3) and he was amazed that I was exactly right. ""Like you're walking down a deserted road with no one for thousands of miles and you know there is someone right behind you.""  Nonchalantly, I told him that I lived there for a year and was well accustomed to the feelings of that house.  When we moved to the house, we had a cat.  The cat would normally be a ""house cat"" and stay around the house with a few late night jaunts.  The critter's behavior changed and it rarely spent time around the house and finally left.  Don't really know why but animals did not seem to like this house.  The problems of living in that house were not shared with our neighbors.  Surprisingly, a neighbor from 3 houses up the block would ask me how I was doing and how things were going whenever he would see me.  Only later, I would realize that he was asking me ""are you doing ok in that haunted house?""  Once, my father and I entered the room next to the room that went to the small attic and felt a presence.  We decided to lighten up the atmosphere and started paying attention to the ghost and actively speaking about being nice to the ghost and maybe ""take a ghost to lunch.""  1/2 hour after we started, without a word, we stopped.  An ominous hostile nature hinting ""stop NOW"" was the general feeling that came about the room.  During that time, the feeling on my back could be shrugged or whisked away with a brush of my hand.  1/2 hour later, we both got up and left.  I asked my father who was a former secret agent and not a wimp, ""let's never do that again.""  He quickly agreed.  Coincidentally, at the time that we lived in the house was when Poltergeist was released to theatres.  I definitely went to see that movie.  After a while, it was obvious to the family that I was having trouble living in the house.  Once I asked my dad if anything happened to him that he hadn't told me about.  He recounted a story of a few weeks earlier where he was sitting on the porcelain throne and the wastepaper basket flew across the room without his permission.  My definition of an area influenced by a poltergeist is if inanimate objects fly around the room without you asking them to.  Up until that point, no one had seen our poltergeist and we were set on staying in that house because it was ours.  It's just what you do.  Late one night, I laid down to sleep for about 10 seconds and then suddenly opened my eyes.  What I saw could not exist in a three dimensional world.  In a period less than two seconds long, a gray object entered my room and flew up into the ceiling above it.  I actually get chills just recounting this story.  The object seemed to be a gray blob with enough ""tv screen fuzz"" so that is blended in with the background but was still visible.  When it entered the room, it came in 4 to 6 feet and went straight up into the ceiling but entered at two separate points. It did not stretch, it did not visibly separate, it just entered the ceiling at two separate locations at the same time without deforming itself.  Slightly stunned, I realized that ""I'd seen it"" and that this was not a window reflection of car lights.  Realizing that there was nothing I could do about it, I went to sleep and told my parents about it the next day.  However the final incident was the killer.  I had left Justin, my beer can collecting friend's, house across town where I had stayed while my parents were on vaca in Hilton Head.  At the time I left, the weather was lovely and sunny.  But in the driving 5 miles to our house, the weather turned sour and when we got to my house, large 40 foot trees were moving like they were getting whipped around, the sky was gray and it just didn't make sense that the weather could change that much in 5 miles.  I have never seen anything else like it since.  Continued…",173184,13949,0,0,1,1,©

Given the circumstances and your current presence here in this location it seems logical that you are indeed the one to be held responsible for this cadaver. Further speculation would suggest that given your ability to generate additional revenue for you and your partners through homicide I have no alternative but to believe that aforementioned positive financial stimulus trough the form of your fourth ability must have taken place here. All things considered, I am definitely curious as to how you personally spend this additional financial gain, given that I have not observed any disbursal from you in the recent past.  Templar Assassin, my dear, you have hit the nail on the head completely. Indeed, it is true, my skills in combat have proven proficient enough for me to slay this sea creature with relative ease. As previously described, I have generated additional wealth using my special skillset of abilities, unique to a headhunter of my stature and cunning. The question of how I choose to invest this sum of funds you have so accurately mentioned previously is, in essence, quite elementary in nature. I would be happy to disclose with you the details of said venture. You see, the very funds I obtain in my dastardly line of work I re-invest in other remunerative markets. The nature of these markets may shock and surprise you, however, as the products they produce are, quite frankly, scandalous and somewhat ironic given my particular skillset. As it happens, the market I choose to invest in is the very producers of charms and trinkets aimed to thwart my own behavior! As outrageous as it may seem, the very tools used in order to circumvent my illusion of camouflage are indeed funded by my own hand!

Its essentially a giant directory, every OS has to be installed in one, even if the partition takes up the entire Harddrive. Windows sees partitions as separate harddrives and every partition is formatted differently to accomidate the OS installed on it. (Windows is NTFS, Linux is ext3 or 4, OSX is HFS+). Because each os uses different drive formats they need to format the partition before they can be stored on it.  When you go through the installer there is an option to install over the entire drive, this will install OVER windows. Take note however this will erase any data on the Windows partition. If you're 100% sure that's the outcome you want you can continue from there and Ubuntu will do everything for you, including setting up swap space. Swap space is where Linux caches files to disk, it's similiar to the page file in Windows if you're familiar with that. It is also required if you want to use hibernation.  2) I can't ensure your wireless will still be working without knowing what model # it is. After searching for your laptop I found three possible wireless card options, excluding 3g wireless cards so you'll have to confirm that with us. It's either an Intel® PRO/Wireless 3945A/G (802.11a/g), Dell Wireless 1490 (802.11a/g), or a Dell Wireless 1390 (802.11g).  4) As for office applications Ubuntu comes with Libre Office which is comparable, there are other alternatives I personally prefer OpenOffice, which libre office is based off of. You can run MS office under Wine, a compatibility stack for Windows applications however I dont think it's worth the effort to get it running.",19537,3596,0,0,1,1,®

Generating revenue by essentially imposing a tax on illness is not good policy. If the goal is to ensure better use of health services, finding and eliminating inefficiencies across the continuum of care holds much more promise.      Tags: Healthcare financing Public/private mix   Tough economic times stir up anxiety over the affordability of public services—especially healthcare. As governments struggle to balance budgets, and healthcare spending continues to grow faster than the economy, conditions are ripe for old—and often discredited—policy ideas to make a comeback. User fees are no exception. At first blush, user fees appear to be an obvious solution. After all, any policy that promises to generate revenue[1] and reduce costs by deterring unnecessary use is hard to ignore.[1,2]  But as research has shown over the years, the silver bullet of user fees really is the stuff of fantasy.[3]  The evidence indicates that implementing a medical toll booth to reduce healthcare traffic along a particular route can obstruct access to needed care, especially for those that are poor.[4]  Viewing patients as responsible for the high costs of healthcare ignores the evidence against user fees and the opportunities for greater efficiency that can be found along the continuum of care.[5]  A medical toll booth simply won’t do the trick.  The Tangle of Necessary and Unnecessary Care  The RAND Health Insurance Experiment, the largest and most rigorous study of user fees to date, found that the more patients had to pay for care, the less they used it.[6,7]  Less care led to lower costs, but it didn’t mean greater efficiency, because sometimes people received fewer services when they actually needed more. Patients did reduce their use of less-effective care, but there was a decrease in the use of effective care as well.[7]  The RAND findings also showed that the proportion of inappropriate hospital stays and admissions was the same with or without user fees.[8]  The RAND findings have stood the test of time. In one study, user fees lowered the appropriate use of effective prevention services and medications to help manage chronic diseases.[4]  User fees have also been shown to reduce inappropriate as well as appropriate antibiotic use to a similar extent.[9]  Savings At Any Cost   In Canada, user fees were introduced in Saskatchewan in the sixties and seventies. Subsequent research found that they reduced the annual use of physician services by almost 6%. Notably, low-income families reduced their use of physician services by about 18%.[10]  Saskatchewan's overall healthcare costs, however, did not go down. Indeed, over the period user fees were levied, physician fees increased and high income earners on average increased their use of physician services.[11]   User fees may also cause some people to forego necessary treatment. In Quebec, for instance, when the elderly and people on welfare had to pay user fees for prescription drugs, they took less medicine and their conditions worsened. **As a result, they ended up with more visits to emergency departments and an increase in serious adverse events.[12]**   **A study of seniors insured through U.S. Medicare found that raising user fees for physician visits and prescriptions increased Medicare costs.[13]  As in Quebec, many patients stopped taking their medications and ended up in the hospital.** These findings are supported by a 2007 systematic review of prescription drug cost-sharing.[14] Researchers found that although it is not certain that user fees lead to negative outcomes for all patients, their effect on the chronically ill was clear: increased emergency department use and hospitalizations.[14]  Who Pays the Price   The Canada Health Act effectively bans user fees for two main health services: hospitals and physicians.[15]  There are good reasons for this. User fees shift costs to those that use the system the most: sick people. This amounts to a tax on poverty and age, since the poor and the elderly are less healthy than other groups.[15,16,17,18]   The poor are especially sensitive to these fees, which have led to policies that exempt them from user charges. A 2010 report examining the possibility of a health deductible in Quebec suggested that such an exemption would thwart much of the revenue-generating potential of user fees.[19]  Because healthcare utilization tends to be concentrated among low-income Canadians, low-income exemptions would significantly reduce the proportion of patients paying user fees.[19]   The poor are negatively affected by user fees in other ways, too. A study looking at the effects of prescription drug user fees found that low-income patients were more likely to stop taking medications to treat chronic disease.[20]  These results are not surprising, as in the RAND study adverse health effects due to a decline in care were concentrated among low-income families.[21,7]  User fees are a blunt instrument for targeting waste. They are aimed exclusively at patients, but patients have very little control over which medical services they use.[11,22]  Patients choose whether or not to visit a doctor, but ongoing care and big-ticket items are ordered by physicians, the “gatekeepers” of the healthcare system.[23,11,22]  What’s more, physician fees account for only 14% of healthcare expenditures.[24]  Patients are not solely responsible for the high costs of healthcare,[3] so it doesn’t make sense to put cost containment on their shoulders. Conclusion  While user fees are effectively banned for hospitals and family physicians in Canada, we continue to have them for many other aspects of healthcare.[25]    If our goal is to ensure better use of health services, the evidence shows that user fees have not been capable of achieving it. Finding and eliminating inefficiencies across the continuum of care holds much more promise. The shift toward integrated and coordinated care delivery systems is encouraging, especially where they have been designed to meet the needs of specific populations.[26]  That said, efforts to integrate healthcare services continue to be frustrated by user fees (routinely required for visits to physiotherapists, psychologists and for home care support, etc.) that can create access barriers to the most appropriate services.

Transcripts are generated using a combination of speech recognition software and human transcribers, and may contain errors. Please check the corresponding audio before quoting in print.  © 2012 Chicago Public Media &amp; Ira Glass Prologue.  Ira Glass Noah, Abraham, King Solomon-- they all sacrificed animals, right? That's just the way they did it in the Old Testament. That's how you worshipped God. And the Old Testament is pretty unambiguous that this is God's very favorite way for people to worship. Exodus says that we're supposed to continue doing this ""for generations to come.""  Deuteronomy warns us against worshipping in other ways, quote, ""detestable ways that God hates. See that you do all I command you. Do not add to it or take away from it.""  So as a kid going to Hebrew school in suburban Baltimore, I never understood why we weren't doing this for God, how we got off the hook from animal sacrifice, the thing that he specifically said was the very best way to show our feelings for him. And it wasn't until this week that I finally learned the reason that we were off the hook. And the reason turns out to be astonishingly simple. Here's a scholar from Boston University named Jonathan Klawans, who is deeply over-qualified to answer this question.  Jonathan Klawans The book of Deuteronomy actually also makes very clear that the only legitimate place for sacrifice is in the place where the Lord God will choose.  Ira Glass And the place that God chose was the temple in Jerusalem. When that was destroyed back in the year 70, it became basically illegal for Jews to sacrifice animals anywhere. Anyway, Jonathan Klawans says that there is a real bias against sacrifice today that began with people centuries ago.  Jonathan Klawans None of these people were vegetarians. These weren't animal rights motivations. This was a notion that somehow prayer is better than sacrifice because it's more meaningful. It's more spiritual. In a way, I view sacrificers as a historical underdog.  Ira Glass In our conversation, by the way, he was careful to point out that he is not an advocate for animal sacrifice. Hold those emails. But he wrote a book that covers this material called Purity, Sacrifice, and the Temple. And he thinks that modern people have not bothered to think through what it would feel like to bring an animal to temple to kill it, to burn parts of it-- or all of it-- as a gift that you were personally giving to the creator of everything.  Jonathan Klawans It's stuff. One is giving something. One of the points that's often emphasized, even in the biblical tradition-- and also in later rabbinic tradition-- about sacrifice is that a proper sacrifice is something that one owns. You can't go steal an animal and sacrifice it to God. And we also have to remember even if we think of animals as property, ancients-- one has to imagine the domesticated life of people, shepherds, living with their animals, who know their animals. A proper sacrifice has to be unblemished.  To have an unblemished goat, one has to really care for that goat, from the time that the goat is born, to ensure that that goat will not become blemished in some way.  Ira Glass So you have a relationship with that goat. When you inspect it for blemishes-- which is Bible speak for any kind of nick, or bruise, or anything-- the goat looks you in the eye. And when you give this animal that you personally know to God, God isn't some abstract being. He is someone, someone who takes delight when you bring something to him, who you have this very literal interaction with. The Bible talks about the smell of the smoke reaching and summoning God.  Jonathan Klawans So yes, there's something really powerful there. There's a ancient writer who writes in the Roman defense of sacrifices. And he says, worship without sacrifice is just words.  I love that phrase, because it totally turns us on our head. We moderns assume that prayer is better than sacrifice. We're so programmed to this. We think that words are better than deeds. Or we think that thoughts are better than actions. But talk is cheap.  Ira Glass Of course, what the animal gets out of this transaction-- the Bible doesn't say a lot about that. But understanding sacrifices, weighing the sacrifice that an animal makes for us, that raises some very basic questions.  Man 1 What is sacrifice?",1565,194,0,0,0,1,©

t5_2qhw1,s810,1356814957,"The other poster cowardly deleted his post, so I'll bite. I hope I am not the only one to respond to your screed here though because there really is no right or wrong answers to your questions, only opinions. I speak from my experience.  &gt;I keep hearing that you guys are some sort of vigilant moral crusaders  Well you should tell whoever you're hearing that from that it's not true, because it isn't now and never was. Anonymous is simply a critical mass of individuals aligned along the same goal, like a flock of birds. There is no ""you guys"", the ""guys"" involved are constantly coming and going. Some are involved in only one action, some are involved as much as they can be in every action.  &gt;If you have no absolute justification for ANY moral values at all, you can not say you are doing something right.  Anons will say they are doing ""right"" just as much as they will say they're doing it for the lulz. Right and wrong is highly subjective and can change in an instant.   &gt;What is morality? Why should I be moral? Why should anybody be moral? Why should you enforce this morality?  /r/philosophy is that way ↗  &gt;If you have no absolute justification for this, then the people you fight against are just as moral, correct, plausible as you are.  Of course they are just as moral, correct, whatever. So what. It wasn't ever about ""morals"". It seems as though you are viewing Anon solely through the lens of Reddit, which is awfully distorting.    &gt;You are essentially enforcing your arbitrary beliefs onto other people.  That's what humans do.   u mad?  &gt;If you say that you should do unto others as you would like done unto you, then why? There is no justification for this rule.  /r/Christianity is that way ↗  &gt;If you say ""we hold no beliefs,"" and then at a later time say ""rape is wrong"" you are either lying or stupid. Besides saying ""we hold no beliefs""..... is a belief itself.  It is analogous to President Obama saying chocolate ice cream is the best flavor, and then some guy in Iowa thinking that means he banned all other forms of ice cream. You can find Anons that hold any and all beliefs that exist; there are very few that are nihilist enough to hold none at all. When you hear an Anon say ""We hold no beliefs"", I think they're referring to the hivemind as a whole, as when they say ""Rape is wrong"" they're talking about their own personal beliefs, which are different than those of the whole.  &gt;Or I get this a lot from liberals ""you have no right to enforce your beliefs on others"".... except for that belief, which you will enforce on others.  lol, You sound like you came from 4chan /pol/. You should really stop hanging out with so many liberal Anons then if they bother you so much. Find some stormfags or lolbertarian Anons, there are plenty around.   &gt;You then say ""we aren't political"" yet you want internet freedom... which is very political.   How so? I don't think it's political at all.  I think Anon as a whole is against the politicization of the internet just as much as they're against corporate or government regulation of it.   &gt;Why should you have internet freedom? Why should you have rights? If you can't absolutely answer these, then you are being just as arbitrary as the people you fight against, and you are enforcing your beliefs onto them.  The internet should be a protected public utility like landline telephone  or electrical service, not a cash cow for megacorporations or a spying tool for nosy government agencies. Of course Anon is arbitrary, that's kind of the point of Anon: it's an arbitrary gathering of like-minded individuals, or just one individual working toward a shared goal. You are ""(en)forcing your beliefs"" on others just by posting this. See how it works?  You are Anonymous.  &gt;Another thing, people always say anon is doing good things, but, when they do something bad (and I am assuming morality for this statement), like finding naked pictures of a girl and sending them to her friends on Facebook to shame her, or hacking a tea-party website (which had no beef with anonymous) they brush it off and say ""well anon isn't an organized group of people so you really can't say it was there fault."" And when they do something good ""I love anon, they do so much good things!!""  It sounds to me like you're butthurt over the reaction Anon gets that cannot be controlled by Anonymous itself. Anon does things for the lulz more often than they do things for the greater good. This has always been the case. I don't know what specific instances you're talking about, but I know that they attacked the Oregon Tea Party a few years ago over the use of their catch phrases, not that they need a reason beyond 'lulz' to attack anyone, especially a political group.   Foolish people who post naked pics to facebook (where they are easily gotten) shouldn't be surprised when others come looking for naked pics, anonymous or not.   &gt;So what, anon can only do good things? When they do something bad it's not anon, but when they do something good it's always anon?  cue the theme song to [*The Facts of Life*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGS56qJ0xIw)   &gt;What is bad, and what is good? How do you know you are doing bad or good if you haven't defined what is bad or good?  Why does it have to be defined at all? Why can't it be as simple as a [hedonistic declaration](http://i2.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/000/142/feelsgood.jpg) ? If you need there to be a moral at all costs then there are well established groups like Amnesty International or The Masons, just to name two random ones.   Perhaps some propagandist Anon upset you at some point? The people who say ""Anon only do good things"" are either wrong out of ignorance or just trolling you. Everything you hear Anon say should be taken with the proverbial grain of salt.  &gt;Why do not forgive? What does that mean?   Well for one thing the saying is never supposed to be without its tandem ""We do not forget"". Forgiving and forgetting is what young people are frequently taught who get mad, and Anon is simply saying they reject that notion. It's not even true 100% of the time. Due to the constant coming-and-going aspect, many Anons don't have any inkling of what Anon was doing years ago, nor do they care. Often the left hand of Anonymous doesn't know what the right hand is doing, and often the right hand is busy fapping while the left hand is scolding others for wanting to fap.   &gt;You will punish people based on your arbitrary set of moral values, and you wont make exceptions?  I don't know where you got this from, but you couldn't be more wrong. Of course there are exceptions, but that doesn't mean Anon has to go around telling everyone what those exceptions are. Other Anons may congratulate someone or something that other Anons are busy condemning and/or attacking. (see left hand/right hand analogy from the previous)  All in all I think you've got the wrong idea about Anonymous. Maybe you should get on IRC and stop paying attention to the moralfag Anons around here. I think you'd see that it's much more of a democratic system where there is no real consensus on actions, just the tyranny of the majority, or individuals acting under the Anon brand name.  It''s fine to be mad at Anonymous (especially those claiming to be Anon on reddit), but don't think for a moment that all of Anonymous is represented by the people you're mad at.  After all, by posting this you are just as Anonymous (or pseudonymous) as the rest of us, which proves that not all Anons are as like minded as you seem to think.  ***tl;dr:*** Anonymous is as Anonymous does. Don't try to analyze it too much because there doesn't have to be a ""good"" reason.",32644,59920,0,0,0,1,↗

t5_2t160,christ0ph,1356821229,"My concern about it is that it preserves an insurance system that is really destructive to our ability to afford insurance, and is wasteful. As a canadian, you should be familiar with the many studies that have been done on user fees. Basically, its been found that to have user fees (insurance premiums and co-pays) actually makes healthcare more expensive in the long run.. The fact is, that people who get care earlier end up costing a lot less in the long run. the US system wastes more than a third of every dollar that goes into it, part of the reason is the complexity of having more than 1500 different payers.  This web page ""busts the myth"" that having user fees (charging people money to access healthcare services) saves money..

t5_2qh1i,KillaPeas,1356839272,"Imperial historical logs; as compiled by Commissar T.G.

The furry abominations, committing the hideous blasphemy of wearing sacred power armor as if in service to the God-Emperor, had been leveling city after city for days. And now... they had advanced upon the capitol city, the last bastion of humanity. However, little did anyone realize that the incursion had been noticed by one of the greatest Chapters of all Space Marines -- whose mighty Battle Barge was even now entering orbit around the planet -- the Angry Marines.  ""GODDAMMIT, WHY AREN'T WE ON THE GROUND YET?"" screamed an armored visage. What remained of his face, had been twisted recognizably by sheer rage. ""Sir, we can't enter the atmosphere that quickly, we'd burn u-"" The voice of the Servitor was cut short as he was crushed beneath the sheer weight of the Marine's armor as he jumped into the pilot terminal. Thus, the Battle Barge, the Litany of Litany's Litany, began its screaming descent towards the besieged planet.  All the while, a cacophony of sickly sounds continued to permeate from the murky planet below.  ""Yiff...yiff...yiff...yiff...""  It was maddening; sufficiently so that any lesser man would have taken his own life. But it had no affect on the stalwart Marines of rage save to infuriate them like never before.  At the same time (and unknown to their brethren on the first Battle Barge, or vice versa), a second Battle Barge of the Chapter, the Maximum FUCK, hovered at the ready directly over the capital city. Upon it, poised the payload of Adeptus Astartes Angry Marines, prepared to make planetfall. Captain Temperus of the 3rd Company watched and waited, his eyes fixed firmly on the screens showing a wave of mutants overrunning the planetary defense force positions. He felt his blood boil as he looked upon the livery adorning their armor, their mockery of everything they stood for. Their faces were an abomination. The heretical glee, visible on their faces even from space, angered the Brother Captain even moar. The comms-servant gave a silent nod, and although it seemed as though he hadn't seen it, Temperus was well aware. It was time-- but he hadn't the patience for any conventional strike, this time. ""CUNT SNIFFING FAGGOT MOTHERFUCKERS!"" He bellowed with rage. With the full force of his forehead, Captain Temperus struck the large red button on the console in front of him, destroying it in the process. Great shields on the side of the Battle Barge turned into place over the front of the craft, forming a giant battering ram shaped like a middle finger. The Maximum FUCK began its nose-first descent into the atmosphere.  The fighting around the capitol city grew more and more fierce. The furred mutants were sending their numbers to die beneath the walls of the city; each one attempting to use their bladed weapon to try and chip away at the hardened rockrete. At first the defenders jeered at their foolhardiness. But as more corpses piled around the walls, the more precarious became the city's chances. ""Keep up that heavy bolter fire!"" the Commissar screamed over the din of the gun placements. ""Bring up the flamers! Show these abominations the cleansing power of The Emperor!"" Just then a Servitor scuttled up to the Commissar's side. ""Milord, crafts from offworld are making planetfall. It appears to be the Adeptus Astartes."" ""Ah, at last. Now we shall TRULY turn the tide against this filth!"" beamed the Commissar. In revelry and decadence, the furries fought and continued to advance. The city would soon fall, there was none alive on Tertius Gamma who could stop them now.  Suddenly, all heads turned skywards, eyes scanning above to find the source of a terrible noise. The two Angry Marines Battle Barges collided sides-first against one another as they plummeted towards a single target. The mutants realized that target was them. The Commissar turned his eyes skywards as the enemy fell silent and a great shadow fell across the lands. ""What the fuck..."" the Commissar uttered under his breath, in disbelief.  ""FUCK YOU, I WAS HERE FIRST!!!"" screamed the commander aboard the Litany of Litany's Litany, as he piloted his barge directly into the heart of the mutant hordes below. ""NO FUCK YOU, I DEPLOYED THE FINGER!!!"" Captain Temperus cursed back.  Traitors fled, mutants hid, deviants cried out for their dark gods to save them. As one, then two Battle Barges slammed into the enemy lines. With a terrifying roar, the planet itself was torn asunder! Tertius Gamma was no more.  +++++  Thought for the Day: Suffer not the Furry to live.  +++++ ",20720,3432,0,0,1,1,♦

t5_2to41,UnstoppableBeast,1356840231,"Hey man, I understand your pain.  Let me tell you a tale of the *Great Shitscapade*.  'Twas nary a few years ago that I slumbered upon a midsummer's eve, a tepid breeze tickled my toes as I slept with only the lightest of coverings. It was a hot summer, that one, one that could leave sweat on the hardiest man's brow...but enough on the scenery, now we shall get on with the real **meat** of the story.   After having had a wonderful dream of emptying my bladder into a porcelain bowl fit for kings, I had awoke to find that my dream had come true (you've heard of the man from Peru, yes?), so with my piss soaked sheets I embarked on my walk of shame half-naked and hurried so my parents were none the wiser.   Circa 5:00 AM I return to my bed, changed and hastily washed, ready to complete my 8 hours of sleep. Again I drifted off into blissful nothingness, but -on my awakening- a dark and powerful storm brewed on the horizon. The shit-stream left my body with the explosive force of Vesuvius; the mighty Hephaestus himself might have used the heat and pressure to form the mightiest weapon known to all the gods of Olympus. Before I even had a chance to grab something, my Xbox pajama pants became heavy with a diabolical concoction of Satan's own devising.   It was not your typical ""splattering"", but rather a flow of foul magma that had been flowing through my intestinal tract for all too long and finally **seeped** its way out of crater that it would soon leave in my ass. I shit you not...if let harden overnight, a 1/1000th scale of the Hawaiian islands wouldn't be too hard to imagine.  So, what was a young man to do? Surely I waited for this assault on my  pride to be over with before I attempted clean up? No, in shock and horror I waddle-crawled to the bathroom passing three rooms over a carpeted area all while this volcanic anus slug slowly sputtered from my deepest recesses with a solid chunk ""plunking"" out every now and then.  The carpet was doused in OxiClean® and a year later we moved out of that house.   Edit- Credit to TheOnlyTheist for catching my embarrassing spelling mistake, if I were to write a story about the most embarrassing moment in my life, it would be this one right one.",11884,38,0,0,1,1,®

Basically the weight limits are much better than other seats (among other things). It's the Diono Radian XT:  The RadianRXT is a highly versatile car seat that could be the only seat you’ll ever need. **It comfortably seats rear-facing children from 5-45 lbs, forward-facing children from 20-80 lbs in 5-point harness, then converts to a booster for children up to 120 lbs.** It’s built for strength and safety with a steel alloy frame, reinforced sidewalls, adjustable head support and our patented SafeStop® energy absorbing harness. EPS foam surrounds the child's head and body to provide complete side impact protection. Our unique SuperLATCH system makes installation easy. The RadianRXT is NCAP crash tested, the industry benchmark for verifying child seat performance in severe accident conditions, and the **only car seat rated for LATCH use with a child up to 80 lbs.** The RadianRXT sits low on a vehicle seat for easy child boarding, features memory foam padding and infant support pillows. Expandable sides and a longer seat bottom provide extra room and comfort for your growing child. One cup holder is included, with the option to add up to 4 cup holders. In addition to all this versatility, it folds flat for travel and storage, has a 10 year life and offers amazing safety, comfort and convenience your child won’t outgrow.  http://www.us.diono.com/en/car-seats/radian-rxt  It's not cheap but the igh weight limits sold me and the safety is top notch. It is also very slim (all the other seats I looked at looked overbulky).",3998,553,0,0,0,1,®

Isn't it sort of like saying ""cat-dog"" or ""Plant-animal""? If some ones grand-daddy was Japheth and they didn't like someone whose grand-daddy was Shem, wouldn't they fit the description of being an ""anti-Semite?     PS: A few years ago some one went around and put soap in gas the IDF had and it was an effective non-violent way of showing their displeasure. I think the individual or group was never cough.

Think of it this way; you get home from a long, hard day at work, and find a stranger in your house. I'm pretty sure your reaction would be to get the stranger to leave. The stranger kills you and dumps you on the side of the road. No one would know what happened.           It'd be different if people used most of the bear, instead of just taking the skins, and wasting the animal. I'm not calling hunters bad people.

t5_2qh61,mollyfied,1356924192,"Okay. **** This isn't what you expected, but that doesn't matter now. What _does_ matter is the taste of the bulbous head of her cock sliding down your throat: mild, with a slight tang, and the milky aftertaste of her cream. It's huge -- almost too big to even swallow. But a few persistent thrusts results in a massive tightening in your throat. You had no idea she was hiding this _monster_ of a member under that smooth dress. What you expected was a tight, firm little slit -- but that doesn't matter now.  What matters is feeling the rich fullness slide over your tongue, against your teeth, down your throat. What matters are the butterflies in your stomach that you could almost swear were conspiring against you, forcing you to be unable to hold still as that warm space between her legs repeatedly chokes your vision. You're surrounded by her delicate scent. It's a miasma of pent-up frustration and smooth longing. It screams her, and your mind starts to go a little fuzzy as your losing your breath, before it happens.  She gasps, jerks, stiffens -- she's coming, and you can barely believe that this is happening to you. Her rich taste is overwhelming not just your taste buds, but those little unexplainable senses at the core of your being... those same senses that told you to ask her out in the first place. You wish you could contain it all, but it's overflowing now, rushing up against your wishes and exploding out of your mouth, just as she exploded into you.  You cough and gag. There's just _so_ much. It feels like a waste to be so inadequate as to not swallow all of the delicious spunk she's saved up, just for you. You briefly contemplate leaning down to lick the excess from her feet, her calves, the floor even... but she draws her fingers under your chin, lifting it, and kisses you.  She's grinning. You taste like her. You're marked. Excellent. Through the smile, she maintains her grip on her lips, sucking the remains of herself from your mouth. It's such an unexpected motion, so sensual and full of feeling, that you almost want to cry.  But there's no time for that, of course -- ain't nobody got time for that. Before the hypoxia haze clears fully, she's pushed you to the ground again, straddling your waist, leaving a slick trail of cum all over your stomach. She's saying something, but all you can focus on is the feel of her warm, heavy breasts on your own, and something hot and smooth impatiently maneuvering between them...  It's her cock. It's long enough to fit through your cleavage, and her own, as she bends over to force it into your midst. But it's not really forcing, is it? Not when you're both so sweaty and aroused that the motions are wet and easy. It's more that the loss of control is... humiliating. It's forces you to acknowledge her superiority. You can't help but feel helpless as she starts to slowly grind through your paired breasts, her breath catching on every thrust, her abs rippling smoothly with the effort under a sheen of juices. She looks so freaking amazing in her power. You can't help but start to writhe in anticipation of her next load.  You never expected this. But then again, you didn't want to. The surprise is part of the thrill. The sex? That's the rest.  Because it _is_ thrilling, isn't? That she's shooting her jizz all over your face yet again, and you can't even squirm away if you wanted to -- and you don't. Not anymore. In fact, you're delighted that she still has more to give (where does it come from?) and she's willing. She's sharing her gift with _you_, all because she thinks you're worthy. And that's a concept that hasn't crossed your mind before -- which is great, because her cum is certainly crossing your face. It's delicious.  Before you can even raise your hands to gather the inevitable excess and eagerly push it your mouth, she turns you over (being manhandled by this woman is exquisite) and leans her head next to yours. She's still hard, and you can feel that hardness between your cheeks, but she's finally laying still. Could it be that she's spent? Is this the end? Is the maelstrom of passionate bliss mercifully going to end?  Oh, _hell_ no. She's simply letting you rest a bit before her next act. Just a bit. Because if you knew what would happen next, you'd seize up, and be in a world of pain. After all, you've never had anal, have you? She whispers into your ear, smoothly, sweetly, ""I'm going to rape you.""  For just a moment, you seize up anyway, because of the word ""rape,"" and all the connotations it bears. But the silkiness of her words relax you, and you're ready to do anything for this vixen with a vice. Anything. Even lose your anal virginity.  It's over in a moment. She thrusts into you, and phosphenes of pain dance across your vision. It hurts. I mean, it really, _really_ hurts. She's so huge! If you knew she planned to fuck your ass from the beginning, you would have glanced at the door, if not bolt to it.  But aren't you glad you didn't? Because despite what you've read on Reddit, asked on Yahoo! Answers, Googled in Incognito, viewed on Bing Video, you've always been intrigued by the idea of anal sex. You've never let your boyfriends go through with it, and your girlfriend has never had a thing for strap-ons (even double-sided ones), but deep down, you've wondered how it would feel to have a rich, thick dick slam your bum from behind as if you're nothing more than a common whore, eager to do the raunchiest of acts for a dead president or two. It's so sick, so perverse -- you poop from there, of course! But, no, wait, _because_ of that, it's something you've secretly wished to try. It's a secret you've kept hidden from your closest lovers... even from yourself.  And against your conscious will, that secret is being pulled to the top of your psyche with every ramming thrust of her hips. It's like a piston drawing water to the surface of the well, siphoning your resistance away until your left with nothing but pleasure and the _exquisite_ sense of fullness. It's breathtaking.   You're blushing. She notices. You think you hear something like, ""I'm thinking your cute,"" but she says it again, and they're probably the best words you've heard in your life: ""I'm... I'm going to cum!"" You can almost feel the ""♥"" in the statement, the hedonism in her actions. Fuck. She's so incredibly sexy, even when reaming your ass, quivering against it, squeezing your breasts, pressing her own against you, biting your ear, then tearing away, unable to even breathe as the torrent of ejaculate pulses through your bowels.  It's too much. The most you can do is scratch the ground, as if clawing for dear life. It's too much to take in. The entire situation, the madness of it all, the intoxication born from such vigor. You feel like you're going to sob.  Too late, you realize that choking knot in your chest isn't tears welling up. It's her jizz. It's found its way from your ass to your stomach... and beyond. You want to hold it in, to savor this undeniable proof of your bond. But, well, you just can't. You're inadequate. And with resignation, your cheeks bulge and your lips pout, but they can't hold the tide of cum at bay. It crashes through the gates of your mouth, exploding in a puddle in front of your face.  All of her tasty cum. Ruined.  You can feel her quaking above you; she's probably touching all over her skin, reveling in the afterglow. Lucky little lady. And you still haven't got your own release, have you? You've gotten so close, so many times, but she always shot first.  That's not going to happen again if you can help it. As she whimpers to herself, you rotate, quick, and give her a full five across her face. She's stunned, and falls back. She isn't knocked completely out, but you can tell she won't be moving for a while. She's not used to losing control like this.  You take your scarf and pull off a bit of improvisation you didn't know you ever had in you. And as you gaze at her delicate little wrists, splayed out on the ground, you know what you have to. You have to bind her. She's a minx. She'll probably wriggle out of the silk knot, but it will be enough for the moment.  She's starting to move when you finish tying her up. She's glaring at you, but the left corner of her mouth is pulling up into a grin; she isn't surprised often, and is wondering what you're trying to pull. She'll find out, won't she? Of course.

t5_2qhfg,madmandendk,1356973433,"almost all source games have Directx 7 support and runs on something like a geforce 2 series card so im pretty confident it can run on almost everything. Of course with low settings. Sure its not going to be running at 60fps but it can be made playable on lowest settings with some minor tweaks.  Torchlights system requirements states it needs a GMA 950 so you would be fine there.   Terraria requires almost nothing to run. ""128mb Video Memory, capable of Shader Model 1.1""  Audiosurf: 32 MB NVIDIA GeForce® 2. This is at least twice as fast.  Beat hazard might not run.  World of goo states that it needs ""Any 3D graphics accelerator less than 5 years old"" which was in 2008 when it released. That should be fine as well then.  The binding of issac should run but might lag. Same for super meat boy.  I ran source games including TF2 on a GMA 950 back in the day so it should not be a problem as long as you have nothing against tweaking the game a little.  ",862,253,0,0,0,1,®
