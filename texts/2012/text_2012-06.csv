There's no obligation even to share your thoughts on it with others if you don't want to. Relax and enjoy.  I do think you bring up an interesting thought though. As individuals we can chose how to interrupt and enjoy religious holidays if we decide to do so and it is interesting to read what personal meaning that this holiday has for everyone.   Personally, since I do appreciate the moral teachings of Jesus, I will reflect on those as I spend time with family. I will try to avoid getting too caught up in gifts and shopping, as I recall my dad stating times before as we watched store parking lots fill with last minute shoppers that sadly Christmas has become a financial burden for many families. We never really did go over the top with the whole presents thing, though I will say that I am lucky to have received many thoughtful gifts.   ‚ô• ",‚ô•

Also she has grandeur plans and see herself as one of the brightest minds of the world (she was also diagnosed with schizophrenia on her teens, but I'm not sure how accurate was that diagnosis, because the doctors were too hasty and apparently quite abusive. also, I don't want to label her, I'm not a doctor)  But she is oblivious about all of that. She doesn't recognize she has an issue and was never on meds (except a brief period when she was interned as a teen). In fact for some time I thought everyone like this didn't recognized their problems as such.  You seem to have a high degree of awareness on how your mind operates. Is this typical for someone bipolar? What's the ""secret"" on being self-aware of those issues?  And how did you became aware of it? Was there a time when you just didn't believe you had problems?  Also. Hmmm. To be honest, I am a bit like my mom (and you) in that I have some mania and I have some focus on grandiose plans. But I try to have a foot on reality, in the sense that my mom has delusions and believe in strange things while mine are more like fictional things that happen in my head (and I know they are fictional).

t5_2qzru,natalietoday,1338525581,"Thanks so much for all your kind words! For a while I wasn't so aware of all the inner workings. In fact, it was actually when I learned about my mother's own diagnosis of bipolar disorder (years and years ago, still untreated, I doubt she even remembers or realizes there's a problem) that the lightbulb went off and I asked my father to take me somewhere I could talk to someone.  Before that point, I don't believe I saw much of a problem -- nor did anybody else, I don't think. I was thought of as ""gifted"" when I was younger; I grasped subjects in school rather easily and got bored VERY quickly with the regular material. As I got a little older, that boredom appeared to turn into laziness and inattentiveness (precursor signs of ADHD), which I notice gets amplified when I'm in a manic state.  When various stressful events happened in my family, (looking back on it now) they seemed to trigger my more intense mood swings. That's when I saw the connection to my mother's mood swings, and asked for help.  As for being aware of how my mind operates... to be honest, I feel like that's really just a pleasant side-effect of slowly coming down from the peak of a manic phase. :) Normally I'm nearly oblivious to how my mind really works, and I'm intensely jealous of my boyfriend who has a very keen sense of his inner self. ‚ô•",‚ô•

t5_2snuc,Dudesan,1338527281,"&gt;This is why Christians do not worry about Shatnez, or wearing veils, or other things from 2000 years ago. We only follow OT laws as far as moral commandments go, not arbitrary taboos.  I've heard many christians claim that there's a distinction between ""moral, civil, and ceremonial laws"", but not one has ever been able to give me a straight answer about how they tell the difference between the three. It's clearly about what they find personally distasteful or silly, but admitting that that was the case would rather undermine their positions, so I hardly expect them to admit it.  Apart from a few commands which were explicitly intended for a specific people at a specific time, there is absolutely nothing to indicate that most of these laws weren't supposed to be binding for everyone for all time.  Remember, many Christians find it more comfortable to believe in a god who doesn't condone, command or commit murder, slavery, rape, child abuse, animal abuse, arson, torture, ritual mutilation, fratricide, patricide, matricide, infanticide, genocide, and so on than to believe in one who does. Unfortunately, since the Bible (Old Testamant and New) is pretty clear about Yahweh's position on these things, holding a belief in Loving Hippie Jesus‚Ñ¢ requires ignoring huge portions of it. Or just never reading it in the first place, which seems to be the most popular option.  Well, let's say what Jesus has to say about that:  &gt;‚ÄúDo not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished.  (Matthew 5:17-18, NIV)  Some Christians claim that his death and resurrection ""fulfill"" this. That is bullshit for one simple reason: last time I checked, Heaven and Earth haven't passed away.  Jesus also made his views on people ""picking and choosing"" quite clear:  &gt;[Jesus] answered them, ‚ÄúAnd why do you break God‚Äôs commandment because of your tradition? For God said:    *Honor your father and your mother;* and, *The one who speaks evil of father or mother must be put to death.*  &gt; But you say, ‚ÄòWhoever tells his father or mother, ‚ÄúWhatever benefit you might have received from me is a gift committed to the temple‚Äù‚Äî  he does not have to honor his father.‚Äô In this way, you have revoked God‚Äôs word because of your tradition. Hypocrites! Isaiah prophesied correctly about you when he said:    &gt;These people honor Me with their lips, but their heart is far from Me.  They worship Me in vain, teaching as doctrines the commands of men.‚Äù  (Matthew 15:3-9, NIV)   Looks like Jesus has quite a bit to say about people who ignore commandments, in fact. But maybe it's just Matthew?  &gt;It is easier for heaven and earth to disappear than for the least stroke of a pen to drop out of the Law.  (Luke 16:17, NIV)  Okay, so Jesus is a bust. Let's see what the Epistles have to say about the Mosaic Code:  &gt; If you really keep the royal law found in Scripture, ‚ÄúLove your neighbor as yourself,‚Äù you are doing right.  But if you show favoritism, you sin and are convicted by the law as lawbreakers. For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it.   (James 2:8-10, NIV)  &gt;All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness,  (2 Timothy 3:16)  &gt;Do we, then, nullify the law by this faith? Not at all! Rather, we uphold the law.  (Romans 3:31)  &gt;Know this first of all, that *there is no prophecy of scripture that is a matter of personal interpretation*, for no prophecy ever came through human will; but rather human beings moved by the holy Spirit spoke under the influence of God.""  (2 Peter 20-21 NAB)  Well, shit.   This problem disappears quite quickly if you assert that most of the Bible is hogwash, and you only care about the good parts. If you prefer to cling to it as an inspired document, vague mutterings about ""context"" or about Jesus abolishing the old Law won't get you anywhere. ",‚Ñ¢

t5_2qyt6,ModerateDbag,1338531265,"With all due respect, my response was super relevant. Those comments are shallow and facetious. A flippant sentence about remembering the days of personal freedom? That's unbelievably shallow. A joke about selling bootleg Big Gulps? Facetious by definition. Clearly they have a perspective of the ""defense of liberty"" but there's still no depth or insight. Lack of depth=shallow. Whether you're a libertarian, religious fundamentalist, socialist, fascist, or whatever, if you make a flippant comment that reaffirms your worldview while necessarily shutting out any discussion to avoid having to educate yourself or debate any of the details of an issue, then you are part of the problem.   Man, I need to go to bed, but you totally got me riled up.   First of all, smoking in public (or in private in a libertarian paradise, because everywhere is in private in a libertarian paradise) affects other people. If I don't consent to smelling your cigarette smoke, why should I be the one who has to leave? It's you who has the disgusting habit! (Note, I don't actually feel that way, but the logic behind banning smoking from bars can't be applied to banning drinking. In fact, a very strong argument could be made that smoking around other people violates the NAP (unless of course you individually ask everyone in the bar if it's ok if you light up) at the same time, telling someone that they can't smoke because you don't like it could maybe carry the same weight) This is at its core a he-said/she-said problem. The argument cannot be settled by considering liberty alone, you inevitably have to involve other factors It might even get as silly as ""well smoking causes pollution, so therefore it's slightly more harmful to others than not-smoking."" Because there's no other way to resolve it. This is a super interesting dilemma to me, by the way.  But whatever, kinda digressing. Point is, smoking affects other people in the immediate vicinity, the negative effects of drinking on others are the result of the Personal Choices‚Ñ¢ of the drinker.   Show me some clinical studies proving that having liberties restricted makes people ok with having more liberties restricted. 1984 doesn't count. Hell, find an objective way to show me that banning large sugared drinks has a deleterious effect on my quality of life. There are governments all over the world that ban shit, and in many of these countries people are the happiest, most socially mobile, wealthiest, have the highest quality of life, least unnatural deaths per capita, highest life expectancies they've ever had in history! Does that mean banning is good? Hell fuckin' naw. It means different things are effective in different contexts.  But yeah, framing rhetoric around how much policy impinges on freedom and how quickly it should be dismissed out of hand is way less effective than actually investigating the positive and negative effects and having a dialogue about them. Evolution is a lot easier to accomplish than revolution. It's dumb to just not participate because you can't get everything you want (not YOU personally, anyone).  I also do not endorse the view that obesity will wreck the economy. I have no idea whether it would or not, in fact. I think economics as a ""science"" is in its infancy such that even if you showed me data that was suggestive one way or another, I would never stop being skeptical. Seriously, we don't know shit about economics. This is also why I am skeptical of a completely ""free market"" if such a thing can even exist. It's used as a panacea for people who don't want to acknowledge market failure or externalities or the timescale required for free market solutions to complex social issues to occur. Bloomberg is not good, I agree. A smoking ban was recently introduced in my home state. Pretty much all of my smoker friends quit as a result. So I am hella biased.   To make it clear that I do not disagree with you about everything ever, I do think liberty is in danger, in a sense. I think we have one of the least efficient democracies in the world. First past-the-post/electoral college/the fact that a person in Iowa's vote counts approx. 3 times more than a person's in Texas/the fact that a president could potentially win with 22% of the popular vote/entrenched 2-party system, etc. Shit's fucked, hard.

The report [TankeNyckeln](http://www.scribd.com/doc/94021562/TankeNyckeln) (like Mind Key or Mind Lever) (I don't usually use Scribd, this was an exception) It's a bitmapped scanned version which a friend kindly provided recently as I had lost my own original in my last move 2007.

t5_2qh6c,aim2free,1338563041,"Thanks ‚ù£  I really hope this accuracy will last, I can make a brief summary of page 61/67:  _We are ""writing"" anno 2037. It has passed one century since Konrad Zuse constructed the first electromechanical digital calculator whose fundamentally simple principle made the computer, the most wonderful invention by mankind, possible. Probably the society would have existed still even without computers, but no-one is longer sure about this._ _During the previous century the humanity was suffering from a lot of problems that today only exists in the historic data bases._ _Here are mentioned such irregularities as starvation, drug abuse, apartheid, environmental pollution and destruction, bureaucracy, educational problems, unemployment and the ubiquitous threat that a leader from one of that era's ""countries"" would choose to solve a conflict with non peaceful means. Word like ""VIOLENCE"" and ""WAR"" were common at this time._  _Today most elderly people have usually repressed that these problems have ever existed. There are many people of the young generation that during their primary education refuse to believe that we have ever behaved like that. However, it often happens that some of the younger persuade someone with associations left from this time to narrate about that era's horror and foolishness._  _The technical and psychosocial development has only during the last 50 years changed the society by enhancing the good properties of mankind to such great an extent that as late as 1970-1990 it was hardly possible for anyone to imagine what will come. During this epoch there were even people that had lost their beliefs in both humanity and mankind._  The 9th generation of programming languages on page 65 can also be somewhat interesting.   *9th:* _The delicate improvements in the communication between man and TOS (Terrestrial Operating System) has implied that you can now work at an abstraction level which approaches the border of human fantasy. A problem or a solution that earlier has been almost impossible to reason about abstractly, can now be formulated thrugh small hints by ""thinking"" as close to the problem as you can. The final formalization of the problem is obtained by automatic or ""manual"" correlation between all possible and many impossible formalizations until sufficient significance has been reached._   It was actually this last part which later inspired me to start my PhD program, and after many years as a researcher and research consultant I realized how to implement this (2004), and the implementation of this is what I'm working on now.

Obviously it will be a challenge to secure the funding in line with our timeline, but ... a lot of people believe in the media spectacle business case.   It's simple: You get what you pay for and people do what they're paid to do.   If you get media spectacle money, then media hype is what you'll get, and it's almost certainly *all* you'll get. To do real exploration, you need to get science funding. That's hard, but not impossible, even for extremely large projects: After all, ITER and the LHC were both funded. If you get science funding, from parties interested in scientific exploration and who pay for exploration, then you'll end up exploring. But as you say yourself, you'll try chasing the media spectacle dollar instead. This means your chances of doing bona fide exploration are pretty much zip, zilch, zero.

Here's my [album](http://imgur.com/a/VpIIa). I'm a low-tech person, so CO2 isn't something I'm going to do. I've had lots of success without touching the stuff (and with crappy lighting, too). If algae becomes a problem, I cut back on light. I also recommend Flourish Excel to nearly eliminate algae and get amazing, lush growth out of plants. It's a remarkably effective product.  The long, shallow tank means that my plants get more even lighting, so I'm actually going for a carpet of dwarf grass, which I've never tried before. The filter is incredibly quiet, and the acrylic is lightweight and easy to manage. Another BIG plus for me is how inexpensive it is. I know it's not much of a status symbol, but it makes me very happy.  I like having a filter on a tank if for no other reason than to mechanically suck the gunk into a central place. I'm fairly certain that my heavily planted tanks could run without filtration, but I don't really want to try it. I don't have any scientific evidence, but I would say that the volume of water in the filter is negligible -- the bacteria will definitely be good. The whole thing, in my opinion, makes for a healthier, better-balanced tank.   On another note, I highly recommend the online option for shrimp and plants. I had always been leery, but for this tank, I bought online and it has gone swimmingly, so to speak.

He almost certainly *will* claim this, so it's important to be prepared.  Remember, many Christians find it more comfortable to believe in a god who doesn't condone, command or commit murder, slavery, rape, child abuse, animal abuse, arson, torture, ritual mutilation, fratricide, patricide, matricide, infanticide, genocide, and so on than to believe in one who does. Unfortunately, since the Bible (Old Testamant and New) is pretty clear about Yahweh's position on these things, holding a belief in Loving Hippie Jesus‚Ñ¢ requires ignoring huge portions of it. Or just never reading it in the first place, which seems to be the most popular option.  Well, let's say what Jesus has to say about that:  &gt;‚ÄúDo not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished.  (Matthew 5:17-18, NIV)  Some Christians claim that his death and resurrection ""fulfill"" this. That is bullshit for one simple reason: last time I checked, Heaven and Earth haven't passed away.  Jesus also made his views on people ""picking and choosing"" quite clear:  &gt;[Jesus] answered them, ‚ÄúAnd why do you break God‚Äôs commandment because of your tradition? For God said:    *Honor your father and your mother;* and, *The one who speaks evil of father or mother must be put to death.*  &gt; But you say, ‚ÄòWhoever tells his father or mother, ‚ÄúWhatever benefit you might have received from me is a gift committed to the temple‚Äù‚Äî  he does not have to honor his father.‚Äô In this way, you have revoked God‚Äôs word because of your tradition. Hypocrites! Isaiah prophesied correctly about you when he said:    &gt;These people honor Me with their lips, but their heart is far from Me.  They worship Me in vain, teaching as doctrines the commands of men.‚Äù  (Matthew 15:3-9, NIV)   Looks like Jesus has quite a bit to say about people who ignore commandments, in fact. But maybe it's just Matthew?  &gt;It is easier for heaven and earth to disappear than for the least stroke of a pen to drop out of the Law.  (Luke 16:17, NIV)  Okay, so Jesus is a bust. Let's see what the Epistles have to say about the Mosaic Code:  &gt; If you really keep the royal law found in Scripture, ‚ÄúLove your neighbor as yourself,‚Äù you are doing right.  But if you show favoritism, you sin and are convicted by the law as lawbreakers. For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it.   (James 2:8-10, NIV)  &gt;All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness,  (2 Timothy 3:16)  &gt;Do we, then, nullify the law by this faith? Not at all! Rather, we uphold the law.  (Romans 3:31)  &gt;Know this first of all, that *there is no prophecy of scripture that is a matter of personal interpretation*, for no prophecy ever came through human will; but rather human beings moved by the holy Spirit spoke under the influence of God.""  (2 Peter 20-21 NAB)  Well, shit.   This problem disappears quite quickly if you assert that most of the Bible is hogwash, and you only care about the good parts. If you prefer to cling to it as an inspired document, vague mutterings about ""context"" or about Jesus abolishing the old Law won't get you anywhere.  Jehovah's Witnesses are also known for claiming that such-and-such a passage wasn't *really* talking about slavery or wasn't *really* talking about child-rape. It's important to know the context, so that when they scream ""out of context!"", you can prove them wrong.  &gt;Matt 16:28: ""Verily I say unto you, There be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom.""  Jehovah's Witnesses actually have an answer to this one- I'm pretty sure they claim Jesus made someone immortal, so that the statement would technically be true. Mormons believe something similar, except that they have three immortal guys. Of course, JWs also believe that Jesus' second coming already happened in 1916 or so (because that's when they predicted it would happen), he was just invisible at the time (because, obviously, nothing actually happened).",‚Ñ¢

t5_2qh2p,Dudesan,1338585418,"Remember, many Christians find it more comfortable to believe in a god who doesn't condone, command or commit murder, slavery, rape, child abuse, animal abuse, arson, torture, ritual mutilation, fratricide, patricide, matricide, infanticide, genocide, and so on than to believe in one who does. Unfortunately, since the Bible (Old Testamant and New) is pretty clear about Yahweh's position on these things, holding a belief in Loving Hippie Jesus‚Ñ¢ requires ignoring huge portions of it. Or just never reading it in the first place, which seems to be the most popular option.  Well, let's say what Jesus has to say about that:  &gt;‚ÄúDo not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished.  (Matthew 5:17-18, NIV)  Some Christians claim that his death and resurrection ""fulfill"" this. That is bullshit for one simple reason: last time I checked, Heaven and Earth haven't passed away.  Jesus also made his views on people ""picking and choosing"" quite clear:  &gt;[Jesus] answered them, ‚ÄúAnd why do you break God‚Äôs commandment because of your tradition? For God said:    *Honor your father and your mother;* and, *The one who speaks evil of father or mother must be put to death.*  &gt; But you say, ‚ÄòWhoever tells his father or mother, ‚ÄúWhatever benefit you might have received from me is a gift committed to the temple‚Äù‚Äî  he does not have to honor his father.‚Äô In this way, you have revoked God‚Äôs word because of your tradition. Hypocrites! Isaiah prophesied correctly about you when he said:    &gt;These people honor Me with their lips, but their heart is far from Me.  They worship Me in vain, teaching as doctrines the commands of men.‚Äù  (Matthew 15:3-9, NIV)   Looks like Jesus has quite a bit to say about people who ignore commandments, in fact. But maybe it's just Matthew?  &gt;It is easier for heaven and earth to disappear than for the least stroke of a pen to drop out of the Law.  (Luke 16:17, NIV)  Okay, so Jesus is a bust. Let's see what the Epistles have to say about the Mosaic Code:  &gt; If you really keep the royal law found in Scripture, ‚ÄúLove your neighbor as yourself,‚Äù you are doing right.  But if you show favoritism, you sin and are convicted by the law as lawbreakers. For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it.   (James 2:8-10, NIV)  &gt;All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness,  (2 Timothy 3:16)  &gt;Do we, then, nullify the law by this faith? Not at all! Rather, we uphold the law.  (Romans 3:31)  &gt;Know this first of all, that *there is no prophecy of scripture that is a matter of personal interpretation*, for no prophecy ever came through human will; but rather human beings moved by the holy Spirit spoke under the influence of God.""

t5_2qh2p,terari,1338605429,"Oh. Hmm. I am myself okay if the mods remove this post. I feel great with it (either on /r/atheism, on /r/LGBT, or any other subreddit where it is accepted by its community), but I respect their policy decisions.  I am also okay with it being posted or reposted on subreddits that would downvote it to oblivion - it is the way communities signal that it is not well received there.  And I am not allowing anything, it's the community of /r/atheism that is allowing its presence. I understand how you see it as inadequate. If /r/atheism weren't a default subreddit, probably this kind of situation would be less common.  I see this problem - where /r/atheism subscribers vote ""wrongly"" at submissions - analogous to the ""dumb voter"" problem on elections, where *intelligent voters* would vote the *good candidate* while the *bad candidate* will manipulate the dumb voters to vote for him (or, the dumb voters would vote for a joke candidate, would waste their vote, etc)  This suggests that the a dumb voter's vote is somehow worse or inferior than a intelligent voter's vote. From this, one might conclude that one should inform the dumb voters better, or failing that, prevent them to vote. This might lead to an aggressively anti-democratic view on elections: namely, that everyone is free to vote, except people who vote like a dumb voter.  Our present situation is a model for that if we equate ""people who did bother to go into the comments"" as ""intelligent voters"" and other people as ""dumb voters"".  We have a mechanism to work around the dumb voters problem: diligent moderation. And we both agreed with its adequacy to tackle the problem, as long as the mods are up to it. So we are in agreement in almost everything, except that you consider the topic of /r/atheism being.. atheism (which is justified!) and that I consider its topic as being more fluid, determined by the present wishes of the community.

t5_2scaw,Aspel,1338607885,"It is interesting to note that over on the other discussion, most of the people who've actually played the game are pointing out that this article is completely overreactive.   Atlus is an incredibly progressive company, and pretty much everything the person writing this article says is incredibly infuriating, not just from the angle of someone saying bad things about a series I like--haven't played half those games, though of note, in *Persona 3 Portable* you can play as a female character, which I jumped at--but because it comes off as another American judging the morals and attitudes of a foreign country without first understanding them. We're talking about a country here that thinks women should be lesbians until they're 16, and who's relationship to LGBT issues is coloured by ancient culture and modern Western ideals clashing.  Naota Shirogane, for instance, is a character type known as *bokku-ko*. Literally, a girl who uses the masculine first person pronoun *boku* to refer to herself. That does *not* mean that she's transgender, although gender *issues* are strongly at play in her story. In a way, from what I've garnered about Naota, she's much like my opposite. She has no problems being female, but she prefers to be mistaken for male. After all, she's doing a man's work. People think she's a man. They'll look down on her less if they see her as him.  Likewise, *Catherine* is another game that has had nothing but praise from the transgender community, leading me to think that the author is talking out of her proverbial ass. In fact, a close friend, trans herself, has loved *Catherine* specifically for the trans character, and if I wasn't poor as dirt and generally not in the mood for a great story broken up by a puzzle platformer--seriously, that is like the biggest gameplay story segregation ever--I'd play it for the trans character myself. As has been pointed out elsewhere, not only is her treatment handled well, the main character already knows from the start, and she gets a happy ending.   Moving on, I love how an example of transphobia is a heterosexual male character seeing a transman in a skirt and saying ""she looks cute"". This article even opens on a shaky at best premise. The only thing here that could even remotely be considered transphobia is the bit with Junpei at the beach scoping for babes, but not wanting to have sex with a transgender woman does not transphobia make. Although I do wonder how that scene plays out with a female main character in *P3P*, since there's only one babe for me, and that's ~‚ô•Junpei‚ô•~.  So, the tl;dr: overreactionary, jumping to conclusions, complete lack of understanding of Japanese culture, and poor writing.  **PS**: And if you're going to downvote me, could you at least *please* attempt to have a discussion, since I've done nothing but raise valid points. You have no idea how irritating it is to be robbed of conversation simply because people don't *like* you.",‚ô•

In all of the individual Diablo III-related compromise cases we've investigated, none have occurred after a physical Battle.net Authenticator or Battle.net Mobile Authenticator app was attached to the player's account, and we have yet to find any situation where a Diablo III player's account was accessed outside of ""traditional"" compromise methods (i.e. someone logging using an account's login email and password).  &gt;To that end, we've also seen discussions regarding the possibility of account compromises occurring in ways that didn‚Äôt involve these ""traditional"" methods -- for example, by ""session spoofing"" a player‚Äôs identity after he or she joins a public game. Regarding this specific example, we've looked into the issue and found no evidence to indicate compromises are occurring in this fashion, and we've determined the methods being suggested to do so are technically impossible. However, you have our assurance that we‚Äôll continue to investigate reports such as these and keep you informed of important updates.  As you can see they're making some fairly bold statements. To their knowledge no accounts have been hacked in a way that doesn't involve the username and password being acquired. No accounts with the mobile or dongle authenticators have been compromised. And finally that there is no evidence of session spoofing and that it is technically impossible for someone to hijack another person's account in this manner.  It's the third statement that is the most telling one. The first two could possibly be retracted later (""upon further investigation"", ""new information has come to light"", etc etc) as they are statements in good faith (""as far as we know"", ""to the best of our knowledge""). But that third statement, if later shown to be false, can probably only be attributed to premeditated deception or gross incompetence, either of which could be used as grounds for legal action if hacks that resulted in the financial information of Blizzard's customers being stolen were to occur.  Sure none of this is set in stone and I may be completely wrong. However, my experience has been that you don't get statements like that from PR professionals unless they can be backed up.",¬Æ

t5_2qi2h,Draegur,1338647488,"Friend, the most important qualifier for being a furry is wanting to be one.  The second most important qualifier for being a furry is ... well it'll take a few sentences to explain: you know how sometimes someone would claim to be a trekkie because they've seen like ONE star trek movie and liked ONE of the characters, and furthermore don't know a phaser from a disruptor from a thumb up their ass, and it's almost *insulting* to a real trekkie? Used to be that the only thing keeping me from feeling like I'm a furry was the fact that I didn't feel like I was, odd as it sounds, 'worthy' of it. Even though being a member of a particular subculture isn't even a very 'prestigious' thing, it's still possible to insult customs--just an example. But if you feel like you dig it, if you love that warm tingly sensation of camaraderie that lights up your day when you find out someone near you is a furry, then you're totally a furry :3 and welcome to it.  important notes:  1. Don't judge people. Like ever. Becoming a member of a subculture means that keeping any reservations about others' taste would make you KIND OF a hypocrite. 2. Don't get upset about being judged. People who can't fess up to their own weird inclinations are made naturally uncomfortable by seeing others who don't suppress themselves the same way.  3. Furries: We Know Drama‚Ñ¢ And you would be best served to not contribute to the drama unless you know exactly what you're getting into. To clarify, by 'drama', I mean a tendency for people to get VERY RAPIDLY insulted and butthurt and indignant about pretty much anything they damn well please because, to be frank, it's **fun**. It is! It's FUN to care about something enough that differing opinions send you on an emotional roller coaster. Be prepared to laugh and cry more deeply, more intensely than ever before, and also be prepared to see people doing that. Just remember: a. Furries can hold grudges. b. Conspiracies abound! Even though there AREN'T any, those acting like there are, and making decisions *as though* there are, can and will have an influence on your experience. Again, it's drama. And it's fun. It's like LARPing gone just an ear's flick too far. Remember my friend, much anguish comes of too-stiff tails.   Hope that helps \^_\^",‚Ñ¢

t5_2qm4e,ech0nd4rkn3ss,1338658604,"#2 Neurogenesis  What Is It?  You know all that controversy out there about stem cell research? Well, the whole thing with stem cells is that they can basically be used to re-generate dead cells. Particularly of interest to zombologists like ourselves is neurogenesis ·¥•, the method by which they can re-grow dead brain tissue.  You can see where this is going...  How This Can Result In Zombies?  Science can pretty much save you from anything but brain death; they can swap out organs but when the brain turns to mush, you're gone. Right?  Well, not for long. They're already able to re-grow the brains of comatose head trauma patients ·¥•·¥•·¥• until they wake up and walk around again.   Couple that with the new ability to keep a dead body in a state of suspended animation‚Ä¢ so that it can be brought back to life later, and soon we'll be able to bring back the dead, as long as we get to them quickly enough.  That sounds great, right? Well, this lab‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ dedicated to ""reanimation research"" (yes, that's what they call it) explains how the process of ""reanimating"" a person creates a problem. It causes the brain to die off from the outside in. The outside being the cortex, the nice part of you that makes humans human. That just leaves the part that controls basic motor function and primitive instincts behind.   You don't need the cortex to survive; all you need is the stem and you'll still be able to mindlessly walk and eat and enjoy Grey's Anatomy. This is how chickens can keep walking around after they've been beheaded (including one case where the chicken lived for 18 months without a head‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢).  So, you take a brain dead patient, use these techniques to re-grow the brain stem, and you now have a mindless body shambling around, no thoughts and no personality, nothing but a cloud of base instincts and impulses.   That, ladies and gentlemen, is what we like to call a real, live, undead fucking zombie. So there.   Chances This Could Cause The Zombie Outbreak?  Think about it. Under every legal system in the world, all rights and responsibilities are terminated at death. All it takes is someone with resources and a need for a mindless workforce of totally obedient slave labor.  How long until somebody tries this? We're betting somebody in the world, maybe North Korea, will have a working zombie by Christmas.   And my favorite #1 Nanobots  What Are They?  Nanobots are a technology that science apparently engineered to make you terrified of the future. We're talking about microscopic, self-replicating robots that can invisbily build--or destroy--anything. Vast sums of money are being poured into nanotechnology. Sure, at some level scientists know nanobots will destroy mankind. They just can't resist seeing how it happens.   How Can It Result In Zombies?  Scientists have already created a nano-cyborg‚ñ™, by fusing a tiny silicone chip to a virus. The first thing they found out is these cyborgs can still operate for up to a month after the death of the host. Notice how nano scientists went right for zombification, even at this early stage. They know where the horror is.  According to studies‚ñ™‚ñ™, within a decade they'll have nanobots that can crawl inside your brain and set up neural connections to replace damaged ones. That's right; the nanobots will be able to rewire your thoughts. What could possibly go wrong?   Chances This Could Cause The Zombie Outbreak? Do the math, people.  Some day there will be nanobots in your brain. Those nanobots will be programmed to keep functioning after you die. They can form their own neural pathways, meaning they can use your brain to keep operating your limbs after you've deceased and, presumably, right up until you rot to pieces in mid-stride.   The nanobots will be programmed to self-replicate, and the death of the host will mean the end of the nanobots. To preserve themselves, they'd need to transfer to a new host. Therefore, the last act of the nanobot zombie would be to bite a hole in a healthy victim, letting the nanobots steam in and set up camp in the new host. Once in, they can shut down the part of the brain that resists (the cortex) and leave the brain stem intact. They will have added a new member to the unholy army of the undead.",‚ñ™

t5_2s5w4,terari,1338724624,"&gt; PS, ""transgender"" is an adjective and not a noun.  Thank you for this correction, I'm not a native speaker. Apparently it is listed at some dictionaries as both noun and adjective (such as [here](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/transgender) and [here](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/transgender)). Transsexual seems to be in a similar situation (such as [here](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/transsexual))  Hmmm. But it turns out the issue is not so simple.  Wikitionary says:  &gt; Noun  &gt; transgender (usually uncountable; plural transgenders)  &gt; 1. (*now rare*) Transgenderism.  &gt; 2. (*sometimes considered offensive*) A transgender person.   and  &gt; It may be inappropriate to refer to or describe a transsexual person as ""a transsexual""; compare ""a black"", ""a gay"". ""A transsexual man"" (for a man who is biologically female, or was biologically female prior to sex reassignment) or ""a transsexual woman"" (for the reverse) is frequently more appropriate.  With the same notes for transgender.  Its inappropriateness is also reported by articles such as [this one](http://www.deeplyproblematic.com/2010/05/transgender-is-adjective-not-noun-or.html).  &gt; Transgender is not a noun. It is an adjective, and reducing people to just one of their qualities is necessarily reductive and denies their gender and their humanity.  and  &gt; Using transgender as a noun is occasionally an ignorant, symptomatic mistake made by a careless writer. But more often, it's an indicator of more issues: transgender or cross-dressing male to describe trans women, a she where a he is needed. It is indicative of a pattern of dehumanization, of degendering. How can a writer too lazy to check the AP style manual or question their own use of nouns and pronouns be trusted to write about trans issues?  This is a perspective I've never thought about, thanks. ‚ô•",‚ô•

I come to you now asking for this donation to the √¢‚Ç¨≈ìLaRue County, Kentucky Marching Band of Hawks√¢‚Ç¨ due to the fact that we lack adequate fundingto buy our first new uniforms in 16 years. Our largest source of capital is the collection of band dues from each student, and although we have the lowest dues in much of the state, even these dues are sometimes too steep for our students. We run on miniscule funding from the school board, the collection of band dues, and fundraiser after fundraiser, yet we sometimes don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have enough money to operate our program during regular season. Even after boasting the title state Champions, the school board has only agreed to pay for 70% of our new uniforms, leaving us with a financial obligation of $12,000. I am asking for help to provide a deserving, dedicated, driven, and disciplined group of students with the new uniforms they deserve. These students practice more than 40 hours a week in scorching heat, they don't just have a passion for band they devote their lives to the band, and from June to November they eat, sleep, and breathe their passion, that passion is marching band.

Now my friend didn't really come from the best of families so the involvement of his parents in his life was slim to none which made what I did all the more easy. The morning while my friend was in the hospital I was back in school and was asked by peers and teachers where he was since his parents hadn't contacted the school. I then proceeded to tell them that we were outside of the movie theatre late that evening before, when a group of thugs showed up and began to harass us  I explained how matters escalated from bad to worse and that by the end of it my friend had been shot and I narrowly escaped while calling for help. I also mentiond that he was presumed dead at the scene before I was taken away.  I called my friend who was in a morphine drip from post op and explained the terrible but hilarious thing I did and he was in stitches with laughter... After he had recovered I'm sure the teachers had figured out he was ok and what really happened, but I had spurred a monster of a rumor of his death amongst the students in our school. Upon his arrival back to school students were mistified with disbelief of the previously deceaseds return.

The bar version has a commercial filler that attaches to a stand alone CO2 tank or splices into the a soda gun.  We are developing a prototype to carbonated bigger amounts, which is being used in a couple of bars.  Here are other advantages of the Perlini: --You can use it to carbonate liquids, both alcoholic and non alcoholic, juices, soups, relishes etc... It was modeled after a Boston shaker with a wide mouth for scooping up ice, and you can pour with it from the top which has a narrow throat and an inbuilt strainer or from the middle, to scoop out a more solid concoction. --Easy cleaning, 100% food safe, and practically indestructible, we have even rolled a car over it.  This was a very important factor for us, as we wanted it to be environmentally sound (we didn't build it to breakdown and be replaced in a few months) and it's Bisphenol A (BPA) free. --Because of the wide mouth you can use it to marinate chicken and other solids. --Even though we have a home use system that uses cartridges, this in a commercial setting becomes very expensive.  Our system with cartridges is really for home use, but with the commercial pressurizer that attaches to a CO2 tank or soda gun, the CO2 is just pennies. --Very fast return on investment.   --You can use other gasses if you choose, such as Argon and Nitrous oxide NO2 if you choose to. --It overlaps with our other system The Perlage System‚Ñ¢ for champagne preservation, as it uses the same filling hardware.

t5_2qh6c,Jbdevery,1338854303,"Thank you!  I will address the many scriptures you quoted to answer your questions. But a Big factor that confuse many people is the different terms used in the Bible which people assume are the same. Such as the term Hades, or Hell, and the term Gehenna.   **Let us start with the lake of fire mentioned in Revelation.** This lake of Fire is mentioned throughout chapters 19-20 of Revelation. Who are hurled into this lake of fire?  The ""wild beast"" and the ""false prophet"" were hurled into the ""fiery lake that burns with sulpher."" The beast is referring to kingdoms or governments of the world, and the false prophet is not simply referring to one person but to a group. Since these are symbolic, it would not be surprising that it is not literal fire either. (Revelation 19:20) But also...  Death, [which will be no more (Rev 21:4)] and Hell, or Hades or the Grave of Mankind, were also thrown in the ""lake of Fire."" Death is not a tangible object, neither is the grave of mankind, so they could hardly be burned. (Revelation 20:14)   Also the Devil was hurled into the lake of fire. (Revelation 20:10)  &gt; In regards to Revelation 20:10, where it says 'tormented forever and ever, day and night' one reference work states: ""The Greek word used here for ‚Äútorment,‚Äù ba¬∑sa¬∑ni‚Ä≤zo, means primarily ‚Äúto test (metals) by the touchstone.‚Äù ‚ÄúTo question by applying torture‚Äù is a second meaning. (The New Thayer‚Äôs Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament) In the context, the use of this Greek word indicates that what happens to Satan will serve, for all eternity, as a touchstone on the issue of the rightness and righteousness...""  The Devil is a wicked angel. And even if he were cast into a Fiery pit, he could not be hurt by the fire, for he is a spirit being and is not physical. (Acts 7:30; Judg. 13:20; Ps. 104:4; Dan. 7:9, 10)  Back in Revelation 20:10, it finishes by saying, ""And death and Ha‚Ä≤des were hurled into the lake of fire. **This means the second death, the lake of fire.**""  The second death, like death, leaves one unconscious (Eccl 9:5). But the context suggest a more definite destruction, and everlasting destruction, with no hope of a resurrection.  The references in Revelation are clearing symbolic, especially when the lake of fire is defined in Rev 20:10.   **In the Gospels**  Matthew 25:41 is part of an illustration. Certainly the sheep and the Goats that Jesus spoke of were not literal. It would make sense that this fiery destruction would compare to that spoken of in Revelation.  But Matthew 25:41 is not the only place that a place of fire is mentioned by Jesus.   This is a section where the proper translation of the Term Gehenna, from the term Hades is important.  Many times Jesus associates fire with Gehenna, some Bible translators call Gehenna Hell.     &gt;Here is an example from an online Parallel Bible. (Matt 5:22) King James 2000 Bible (¬©2003)""... but whosoever shall say, You fool, shall be in danger of **hell fire**."" Young's Literal Translation ""... and whoever may say, Rebel! shall be in danger of the **gehenna of the fire.**""  What is Gehenna?  Gehenna is the Greek form of the Heb word, ""Geh Hin¬∑nom,"" or literally, ‚ÄúValley of Hinnom‚Äù.  God prophetically decreed that the Valley of Hinnom would serve as a place for mass disposal of dead bodies rather than for the torture of live victims. (Jer 7:32, 33; 19:2, 6, 7, 10, 11)   Jeremiah 31:40 spoke of ‚Äúthe low plain of the carcasses and of the fatty ashes,"" which is accepted as designating the Valley of Hinnom.  &gt;One Jewish commentator David Kimhi (1160-1235?), gave the following historical information: ‚ÄúAnd it is a place in the land adjoining Jerusalem, and it is a loathsome place, and they throw there unclean things and carcasses. Also there was a continual fire there to burn the unclean things and the bones of the carcasses. Hence, the judgment of the wicked ones is called parabolically Gehinnom.‚Äù  Luke 12:4,5 shows a difference between death, and being cast in Gehenna. Mat 10:28, similarly shows how you can be killed, and still be resurrected (destroy the body and not the soul, or not your life or chance to be resurrected [For god is the God of the living (Matt 22:32; Romans 4:16, 17) but not the body and soul in Gehenna).  Jesus also alluded to Isaiah 66:24 in describing Gehenna. He said it is a place ‚Äúwhere their maggot does not die and the fire is not put out.‚Äù (Mr 9:47, 48)  The symbolic picture here is not one of torture but, rather, of complete destruction. In Isaiah the text deals not with persons who were alive, but with ‚Äúthe carcasses of the men that were transgressing‚Äù against God.    *[There is also one parable about a Rich man and a man named Lazarus (Luke 16:22-24) which many will use to try to prove hellfire. But by examining the context and the entire account shows that it could not have been literal.*   *1. It would contradict Eccl 9:5 that the dead are conscious of nothing.*   *2. There is no statements that show the rich man was wicked, or that the poor one was righteous, if it was literal would this mean that the rich are all wicked and the poor all righteous?*  *3. They mention a drop of water cooling off the rich man in Hades, but if this were a literal fire, would a drop of water cool of the man in Hades, or would it even survive the heat?*   *4. Also, if the fire is literal, does that mean all righteous ones will be in the bosom of Abraham after death? (This parable showed how the Jewish religious leaders, pictured by the rich man, were self-righteous. Lazarus pictured the remnant of Jewish people of faith despised by the clergy and who were spiritually hungry. The death of the two men pictured a change in the two classes. Jesus tormented the clergy by exposing their greed and their false teachings and their hypocrisy. The clergy murdered Jesus. So the clergy came out of a luxurious condition into one of torment. But the remnant of faith had a change for the better. They received spiritual food, an opportunity to come into favorable relationship with the Greater Abraham, God)*    It is also good to note the accounts found in Jeremiah where God expressed repugnance for such practice of burning people, saying that it was ‚Äúa thing that I had not commanded and that had not come up into my heart‚Äù (Jer 7:31; 32:35)  Since something so similar to hellfire never came up into his heart, how could he of created a hellfire hundreds of years earlier?   In a nutshell, (which is hard to do.. haha..) the lake of fire is a symbol. Why?  1. When used in Revelation, symbols (wild beast), intangible ideas (death), and spirit creatures (Satan) are hurled into it. Fire can not affect any of these things, therefore it would not make sense for it to be literal fire.  2. Revelation defines the Lake of fire as the second death.  3. When Jesus refers to fiery torment he is either including it in parable or grouping it with symbols (sheep and goats - fiery destruction; Abraham's Bosom - Burning Hades)   4. Or Jesus is making reference to Gehenna, or the Valley of Hinnom, which did use fire to burn carcasses and waste. There even could of been a continual fire there as some references say. (He also was referencing Isaiah at one point, which clearly was speaking of ones already dead.)  5. If there was a lake of fire that tormented the wicked it would contradict the fact that the dead are unconscious (Eccl 9:5) and the fact that death as a punishment is used in contrast to everlasting life as a gift. (Ezek 18:4; Romans 6:23 - ""For the wages sin pays is death, but the gift God gives is everlasting life by Christ Jesus our Lord"")   Again, sorry for the length. If you have any further questions, ask away!            ",¬©

t5_2qh61,terari,1338926130,"Oh. I'm familiar with this point of view. For a long time I called ""GNU/Linux"" the operating systems that had Linux as kernel and ran a GNU userland. I would even argue nomenclature with strangers like you did now :)  But let me defend my vocabulary usage here:  &gt; I convinced maybe 10 or 20 people at university to install Linux.  In this sentence, ""Linux"" does not refer to the kernel Linux literally. (I know you know this. I'm just asserting it). This word, instead, is a [metonymy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metonymy). A metonymy is a figure of speech used when you call refer to something using the name of something else related to it. For example, when you call an operating system by its kernel or when you attribute an announcement of federal government to ""white house"". To illustrate, see this following Slashdot headline:  [White House Announces Initiative To Fight Botnets](http://slashdot.org/story/12/05/30/2242222/white-house-announces-initiative-to-fight-botnets)  In this usage, ""White House"" does not refer to the building itself, but it is a metonymy for the current administration of US federal government. The White House is actually a tiny part of the real estate controlled by the Obama administration; it is, however, a symbol of presidential authority.  The use of metonymies is justified linguistically (even though it may be [confusing](http://www.bellaonline.com/articles/art14294.asp)). There are two issues, now: if Linux is a legitimate metonymy for a whole OS containing it, and if it this specific usage is justified ethically: that is, if it is right or wrong to use the word ""Linux"" to refer to a operating system that contains Linux.  The concept of ethics of language might seem odd for some people (and specially for people unfamiliar with the [GNU/Linux naming controversy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU%2fLinux_naming_controversy)), but it is actually quite reasonable. For example, I recently discovered that the term ""tranny"", used to refer to trans women, is considered very offensive by such women (I am not a native English speaker). Because of this, I wouldn't normally use such term.  I don't, however, understand the term ""Linux"" as particularly offensive or damaging. You are right it that fails to give credit to some people that worked in important parts of the OS, but I don't see why my vocabulary choice should be directed at giving credit to them. They obviously deserve to get recognition; my suggestion is that they acquire it through other means.  I understand how my position may be considered subjective. If you feel pressured to give credit to the GNU project through your word choices, be welcome!  Now, the appropriateness of Linux as a metonymy is much more objective. It is a well understood term that convey the desired meaning to a large number of people. Even you, that didn't like this usage, understood what I meant. The goal of language is to convey meaning. Being well understood is reason enough to justify a linguistic construct. That explains why I decided to use ""Linux"" in that sentence.  Now, GNU/Linux is also a metonymy. That's because operating systems based on both GNU and Linux don't use solely those two components, and there are many operating systems based on both GNU and Linux. Its usage is also fine, but with a caveat: it does not refer exactly to the same set of operating systems. Android, for example, has Linux as an internal component but does not ship with GNU components.  This subject is actually pretty extensive and I didn't refute your arguments directly. If I had energy (and this text weren't so big already), I would dispute your notion that operating systems like Arch Linux or Gentoo are ""basically"" the GNU system.  Have a nice day. ‚ô•",‚ô•

Walk a Mile in Her Shoes¬Æ asks men to literally walk one mile in women's high-heeled shoes. It's not easy walking in these shoes, but it's fun and it gets the community to talk about something that's really difficult to talk about: gender relations and sexual violence.  &gt;Then You Talk the Talk  &gt;It's critical to open communication about sexualized violence. While hidden away, sexualized violence is immune to cure. Unfortunately, it's difficult to get people talking. People unfamiliar with sexualized violence don't even want to know it exists. It's ugly. People that have experienced sexualized violence themselves want to forget about it. How do you get people talking now, so they can prevent it from happening? And if it's already happened, how do you help them get help to recover?  &gt;A Walk a Mile in Her Shoes¬Æ Event is abundant with opportunities to get people talking. For preventive education, it helps men better understand and appreciate women‚Äôs experiences, thus changing perspectives, helping improve gender relationships and decreasing the potential for violence. For healing, it informs the community that services are available for recovery. It demonstrates that men are willing and able to be courageous partners with women in making the world a safer place. The Walk Event Experience provides a description of how these opportunities might present themselves at a Walk a Mile in Her Shoes¬Æ Event.    This whole initiative uses an event (try to experience how women walk) to promote awareness about sexualized violence and improve gender understanding and collaboration. There is no exclusivity in the discourse (only men/women can be victim/rapists).

No, sir!  Whee, and apparently you are also one of those types that gets all offended and puffed up, and then demands ""Apologize to me right now"" as a debate tactic.  To that I say ""No, I don't think so, junior.""  You are a piece of work, Greggor88. Time for me to knock down your rantings some more:  &gt; You're not even trying to be honest anymore. You're straight up lying to try to make yourself look good. In fact, everything you said in that first paragraph is a statement of fact, with the exception of the ""presumably"" clause that you tacked on.  First off, that makes *no sense whatsoever*.  It essentially says ""You are a liar and everything you said is true! Well, except that thing you said that may not be.""  -- Whaaaat?  So what is it you are accusing me of, exactly?  I mean, *other than* the unjustified ""liar"" part, of which I await your explanation.  &gt; point to where you used the words ""sounded like"" or ""assume"".   How could I, since I never said *exactly* those words, nor did I claim to have said them.  You've got some serious reading comprehension issues, or else willful blindness.  What I said -- which you even quoted above -- was:  &gt;&gt; I even used words **like** ""sounded like"" and ""assume"".   Feel free to check the dictionary on this, but ""like"" (in that context) means... ""similar to"".    If you still don't comprehend my sentence, it was meant to convey ""I know that in my multiple prior comments above I wasn't speaking in absolutes or calling thing facts when there were no known absolutes or facts"".  I am personally fairly consistent about using adjectives to indicate imprecision when precision is not available.  One example of my use of adjectives to indicate known imprecision was even quoted by you!  &gt;&gt;  **presumably** starting his slow return  ""Presumably"" because we can't know for sure, but presumably it sure sounded that way to me in the recording.  Is this what you think is The Big Lie‚Ñ¢ that you think you've caught me in?  Or is there more?  Oh, wait, there was... this is rich, I get to knock down some more of your reading comprehension failure:  &gt;&gt; Actually, the way I heard it, he said ""I'm NOT going to run"" and other such ""bravado"".  &gt; That's simply not the case. Zimmerman himself stated that the suspect was running in his phone call to the police.  You were, immediately preceding, talking about *Martin's phone call to his girlfriend*, and ergo so was I.  It is recorded testimony and evidence (from her) that when she told him to run, he said something along the lines of ""no, i will not run!"".  At no point did I say Martin *DIDN'T* run; I said that he said to his girlfriend that he wasn't going to, and that was relevant to point out because it is a show of bravado. And all that being said was to support the point that Martin wasn't just ""a scared little kid"" as others would make him out to be (scared kids run and hide and DON'T come back).  He seemingly wanted to look tough, wanted to make the guy that scared him sorry for doing so, and in the end he did attack his former pursuer.    &gt; Here's what I have to say about that: at what point was Zimmerman's back turned? At what point was he walking away? We have absolutely zero witness accounts that claim that Zimmerman was walking away from Martin, with his back turned.  The point immediately preceding the sucker punch, I'd imagine.  Oh, and there *IS* a witness to it, but you refuse to accept his testimony.    Actually, come to think of it, the coroner's report is pretty good testimony, too, regarding the notion that Zimmerman was caught by surprise (given the nature of his injuries, and the dual black eyes supporting his testimony as it was given)  &gt; you're claiming that this change of aggressor as a key point in your argument, and we don't even know that it happened!  Am I?  Or are you making shit up again.  If I'm claiming that it happened, and that's a key part of my argument, then you must be claiming that it didn't happen as a key point in your argument.  And yet, as you say, ""we don't know"".  Of course if one considers the legal definition of physical assault it's difficult to make Zimmerman out as the instigator when the doctor's report shows lots of head injuries to Zimmerman, and the **ONLY** injuries on Martin, as reported by the coroner, were his bloody knuckles.  So point of fact, it doesn't matter worth a tinkers damn if Martin was ""scared"" by Zimmerman at some point.  What matters, in answering who the ""aggressor"" was, who started the *physical* confrontation, is where the wounds were -- who did the punching, and who was receiving them.  Since Martin had no bruises or lacerations himself, it would appear he was never punched.  And I doubt he beat the shit out of Zimmerman after he was shot, since it was reported that he would have been killed instantly, given placement.  To reiterate an important point: scaring someone is NOT physical violence, and is never responsible for any physical violence (no matter how much the Martin Apologist camp wants it to be that way)  &gt; But the prosecution obviously thinks it has a case, otherwise it would not have charged him with second degree murder.   Hahaha, that's not how it works.  The prosecution charged him because there was an angry, violent mob threatening to turn the city (and possibly the nation) inside out if he wan't arrested and charged with something.  That prosecutor was simply trying to stop a scene, and/or bowing to mob pressure, and/or trying to look the hero.  &gt;  I say you stop bitching about how unfair it is that the justice system is doing its job  Oh, really?  And where in my text (feel free to check your screen captures if you don't trust reddit) was I bitching that the justice system wash doing it job?  I'll wait.  In fact, the only bitching I've don't is about people (like you) who keep giving twisted and cherry-picked facts to make Martin look like a saint, and Zimmerman look like a criminal.  All I want, and the only thing I'm ""bitching"" about (if it even is bitching) is how people (again, like you) seem to be rushing to judgment and NOT letting the justice system run its course.  I want it to run its course, because I believe the verdict (assuming an unbiased judge and jury) will HAVE to be for a non-conviction, because there simply is no evidence that Zimmerman did any of the things that the Martin Apologists keep in their starry-eyed dreams.  &gt; I never advocated locking anyone up  True, and least not directly and literally.  But every single argument you've made here has been in support of ""how Zimmerman is the bad guy"" and ""why Zimmerman should be found guilty"".    You can say all you want that you are advocating for a fair trial, but I just can't buy it, given your many statements here.  &gt; Let's count the amount of times I quite specifically said that I do not know whether or not Zimmerman was guilty of anything.  Yes, yes, on the technicality you keep saying ""I don't know"", but that doesn't mean you don't *HOPE* he is guilty, and your demeanor here screams of it. ",‚Ñ¢

t5_2qhx4,KillerCalves,1338958548,"Like everyone else said... Yes it is doable.  This past Sunday, I ran my 10th half marathon. It is a life style change and you must take it seriously. From investing in a pair of good running shoes, to going to bed early for long runs...it' can be done.. There is nothing wrong with running X amount of time and then walking for a minute. I suggest looking at this as a life style change and not just a way to lose weight. There will be days that running is the last thing you want to do or days where it is easier than others. I use Hal Higdon's training schedule for the first few but I went out of my way and actually joined a running group. It was out of my comfort zone as I was not an avid runner and was slowest. But it really motivated me and I learned a lot about pace, nutrition through out training and during race day, dos/don't about running, speed work, technique and many other things. I also got a simple heart rate monitor to know what heart range should be while running.  That way, I didn't burn out during longer runs.   You can totally do it and will feel so proud of yourself afterwards. If it was an easy task, everyone would be out there running. üòä",üòä

Unit testing mainly refers to testing one piece of functionality [in a system] at a time, and in isolation from other pieces; the pieces are referred to as units.  One thing it will then foster is writing loosely coupled code (because it's functionality has to be independent of other code in order to be tested as an isolated unit), which is generally regarded as A Good Thing‚Ñ¢.  Test Driven Development is based around writing code to pass tests. In order for the code to pass tests, the tests for the code have to be written first, or at least right-after.  Code coverage is then regarded as how much of your code base is covered by tests; i.e somewhat simplistically, what percentage of your functions have a test written for them to ensure they perform as intended.  The more code coverage you then have, and the more thorough the tests and numerous the test cases, the less likely that the code base will perform out-of-spec (do the wrong thing) in practice, and the more likely that bugs introduced by changes to the code will be picked up immediately.",‚Ñ¢

Diffuse grumbling caused by lingering bitterness is clearly a nonissue relative to that. The worst real world effect of that sort of bitterness is a lower than likely chance of being invited back to a dinner party.  1) Nor have I advocated that. In fact, you were the one suggesting we should ""disavow"" the misanthropes amongst us. I'd rather take a cold hard look at who they are and why they're around. Usually they have a lot of valid reasons, just taking the response to an extreme. I suggested self-policing of problem children rather than GLOBAL policing in a vain attempt to prevent the problem from arising. I don't see a whole lot of theists self-policing in that way... if anything, attempts at theist self-policing just end up creating more and more splinter groups, like some sort of ecclesiastic sorcerer's apprentice.  2) Some atheists aren't smart and will fall back on rote and dogma. Should atheism be exclusive only to those ""smart enough"" to defend it with formal logic? Shall education and problem solving intelligence be *our* shibboleth? I'd much rather have a wide tent that arms people with basic tools to shoot down 99% of the standard theist nonsense than make atheism some sort of exclusive club that only accepts those who can come up with their own flawless refutations. Yes, non-self-reflective people will be non-self-reflective and there's going to be be people who take up atheism without really thinking about why. I'm completely sanguine with that, so long as those people are *not* giving time and material support to theist causes that are dedicated to denying the rights of others and rolling back the progress we've made over the last 5 centuries.  In an ideal world, people would take up atheism because they're self-reflective rational thinkers who have concluded that there is insufficient evidence for any of the offered gods, and so reject the wacky myths of their parents. In the real world, I'd much rather give people free rein to explore what it means to be an atheist, *even if that means they adopt some reflexive antiatheism as part of the deconversion process*, because in the long run less harm is being done by that than disowning anyone who strays from the One True Path of Atheism‚Ñ¢.

t5_2qxih,jacobisconfused,1338992170,"Class changes and balance in Game Update 1.3 Hello everyone. My name is Austin Peckenpaugh, and I‚Äôm a Senior Designer on Star Wars‚Ñ¢: The Old Republic‚Ñ¢. My job here is to create, maintain, and balance class gameplay in The Old Republic. As such, I‚Äôm here to shed some light on the upcoming changes to classes in Game Update 1.3 to give you all a sense of what‚Äôs to come and why it‚Äôs coming.  Like with any major patch, Game Update 1.3 will bring with it an array of class updates. Before I go into detail on any specific changes, I wanted to use this opportunity to share our philosophy as to why classes need to change at all.    Class Changes I think it‚Äôs important to first communicate that not all class changes are meant to address balance. In fact, I try and treat usability, quality of life, and balance all as equal parts of good class design. To that end, when class changes come to a server near you, it doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean that your class was ‚Äútoo good‚Äù or ‚Äútoo bad‚Äù prior to the patch. In fact, it‚Äôs just as likely that these changes are meant to address kinks or even pains in your day-to-day play, ability functionality, and rotations.  However, many changes are made with the express purpose of changing balance. This is an ongoing process, but that doesn‚Äôt mean that we‚Äôre locked in a never-ending tug-of-war between the classes. In actuality, many components of classes are balanced against ‚Äúhard targets.‚Äù  For example, some components of class balance have a ‚Äúgive and take‚Äù quality that is directly related to what other classes can do. If we lowered the cooldown of a Guardian‚Äôs Force Leap, the kiting and anti-kiting dynamic with ranged classes will have shifted. If, however, we increase the damage Vigilance and Focus Guardians deal, that moves them closer to or further away from our targets ‚Äì the same targets shared by all DPS specs.  These targets are rigid in that all specs must hit them, but these same targets are also flexible that once a spec is within range of them, there‚Äôs some flexibility as to where that spec ultimately ends up. Is being 2% above target acceptable given how immobile you are? Is being 2% below target acceptable considering your off-healing and control capabilities? This is where our balance gets subjective and why, in spite of any mathematical accuracy, we‚Äôre constantly reevaluating class balance. It‚Äôs through this iterative process that we test our assumptions, using our own experiences and those of our players to identify the issues and, more importantly, identify non-invasive fixes.  Changes for Tank Characters  Each major patch is an opportunity to reassess the current status of key combat systems to make sure they‚Äôre still working how we expect them to. In Game Update 1.3, one of the major goals was to better normalize single-target and AOE tank threat.  Threat generation for all tanking stances has been increased to 100% (up from 50%). This is a big one. We‚Äôve received a lot of feedback from tanks regarding how easy or difficult it is to hold threat on various encounters. Between taunts and de-taunts and the fact that most encounters give tanks more uptime than DPS, single-target threat should be easy for a tank to maintain. While this change will make it even easier, ultimately single-target tanking gameplay won‚Äôt be affected much by this change. AOE threat generation, on the other hand, should improve significantly.  In addition to the blanket threat increase, we‚Äôve made several targeted changes to AOE threat generation across the tanking roles with the intention of both normalizing AOE threat building and giving each tank one or more go-to abilities for on-demand AOE threat.  Cyclone Slash/Sweeping Slash now apply an accuracy debuff with the Dust Storm/Quake skills. Guardian Slash/Crushing Blow have been slightly redesigned to deal AOE damage when striking a target with 5 sunder stacks (and now spread those stacks). This AOE damage is ‚Äúsmart‚Äù and will not hit enemies affected by control that breaks on damage. Single Saber Mastery now offers effects based on your current Form. In Soresu Form, Cyclone Slash/Sweeping Slash and Force Sweep/Smash deal increased threat. Force Breach (Combat Technique)/Discharge (Dark Charge) now generate increased threat. The AOE damage dealt by Slow Time/Wither is now ‚Äúsmart‚Äù and will not hit enemies affected by control that breaks on damage. Supercharged Ion Cell/Gas now cause High Impact Bolt/Rail Shot to trigger your Ion Cell/Cylinder on the target and on up to 4 additional nearby targets. This AOE damage generates a high amount of threat and is ‚Äúsmart,‚Äù meaning it will not hit enemies affected by control that breaks on damage.  We are also striving to make all tanks hit the same survivability targets for Game Update 1.3. Testing shows that the self-healing generated by Shadow/Assassin tanks is too powerful after the armor adjustment they receive via Combat Technique/Dark Charge. This armor adjustment should have brought Shadow/Assassin tanks to lower passive survivability levels than the heavy armor tanks, with the self-healing they provide making up for the difference. However, this armor adjustment was making them passively just as good as the heavy armor tanks, with the self-healing taking them a bit beyond our survivability targets. Rather than hit armor or self-healing too hard, we‚Äôve opted to adjust both by a much smaller amount.  The healing generated by Combat Technique/Dark Charge has been reduced by approximately 50%. The healing generated by Harnessed Shadows/Harnessed Darkness has been reduced to 8% in total (down from 12% in total). The armor provided by Combat Technique/Dark Charge has been reduced to +115% (down from 150%).    Changes for DPS Characters  We‚Äôre always trying to make sure that the ‚Äúcapstone ability‚Äù at the end of each skill tree is attractive and appropriate for the investment required to unlock it. In Game Update 1.3, the Sharpshooter/Marksmanship trees have changed for the Gunslinger/Sniper to provide a more attractive and better-performing capstone ability.  Rapid Fire is no longer the capstone ability for Sharpshooter/Marksmanship. Rapid Fire is now a 3-pt passive skill that reduces the cooldown of Aimed Shot/Ambush and Speed Shot/Series of Shots. Blaster Volley/Sniper Volley is the new capstone ability for Sharpshooter/Marksmanship. This is now an active ability that finishes the cooldown on Speed Shot/Series of Shots and greatly increases alacrity and energy regeneration for about 10 seconds. With this change, Gunslingers and Snipers will benefit from better on-demand damage and energy management, something we believe complements their existing arsenal without drastically altering their gameplay.   Additionally in Game Update 1.3, we‚Äôve made changes to improve the gameplay and quality of life of Commando/Mercenary damage-dealing specs. We‚Äôve spent a lot of time playtesting and investigating the concerns of the community, and while Commando/Mercenary damage is largely on target, prior to Game Update 1.3, resource management made performance streaky and a little too unreliable.  We‚Äôve made the following changes to the Commando/Mercenary for Game Update 1.3 to improve resource management and simplify stack upkeep for Gunnery/Arsenal specs:  Cell Charger/Terminal Velocity has been redesigned to passively restore 1 energy cell/vent 8 heat every 6 seconds. Gravity Surge/Light ‚ÄòEm Up now additionally grants an extra stack of Charged Barrel/Tracer Lock and Charged Barrier/Power Barrier, if applicable, with each Grav Round/Tracer Missile fired. Target Lock/Advanced Targeting has been redesigned. Now gives Full Auto/Unload and High Impact Bolt/Rail Shot 10% armor penetration per point. Now Gravity Surge/Light ‚ÄòEm Up simultaneously increases the number of stacks built by each buff tied to Grav Round/Tracer Missile. This small change gets Commandos/Mercenaries into their core gameplay faster and more seamlessly. Additionally, we‚Äôve improved the resource management game and have given Commandos/Mercenaries some armor penetration for better parity with Vanguard/Powertech Assault Specialist/Pyrotech skill trees.  Future Game Updates   As previously stated, classes in Star Wars: The Old Republic will continue to undergo constant evaluation. Many future changes will be similar in scope and purpose to what I‚Äôve described in this blog ‚Äì to address usability issues, improve quality of life, and make the most non-invasive changes we can to correct emerging balance issues.  As far as any specifics go, nothing for future Game Updates is locked down well enough yet to comment on. However, I hope the information I could share with you today has helped shed some light on our processes and our motivations. Thanks for reading and playing.  Austin Peckenpaugh Senior Designer",‚Ñ¢
t5_2qh03,VulturE,1338992233,"&gt;  Mario and Donkey Kong, and to a lesser extent Zelda are exactly that. Kid games. Nothing less and nothing more.   They are platformers that offer a degree of difficulty that progressively got harder as the game went on. Most of these Family Friendly‚Ñ¢ games we have nowadays are not interesting enough to even consider, let alone there is no difficulty level.  Example: Elevator Action could be described as a platformer, but since it had very monotone music, no boss level, no difference in levels, and it had sorta clunky controls, it can be played for a little while before switching to a different game. It felt like a high-school experiment. Many of these Family Friendly‚Ñ¢ games coming out and announced at E3 feel like fluff developed by interns with zero replayability, and are only sold to attempt to sell more consoles.  At the end of the day, you may be right about some of your points, but there is no denying that these games are utter mediocre crap that rejects the main group of gamers in hopes of bringing new money into the fold.",‚Ñ¢

t5_2u45t,Elliptical_Tangent,1338994423,"&gt;I do think that maybe we could **add** to your character's pre-existing first aspect, the idea that he is compelled to obey his wizard master.  I have every intention of RPing Lock as his master's creature.  It's his raison d'etre, literally.  We could say that it's only the wizard's will that keeps Lock alive (although that might mean the wizard has to be alive and I like not knowing, so you decide on this without me, please).  ""My Master's Burdens"" feels to me like it has room in it to hold the occult knickknacks as well as a compel to service, right?  Do you think we need to rename it?  I think it has room in it for other stuff that comes up too - like a letter saying the wizard owes so-and-so Power service, so Lock goes off to try to pay the ""debt.""  &gt;Oh, also, you wanna name the wizard? I love naming characters, if we wanna brainstorm ethnicity or countries of origin to draw names from.  Lock _cannot_ know anything identifying about the wizard.  Lock can't know the wizard's name, the wizard's height, weight, gender, sexual orientation, shoe size, favorite food, nothing.  He was created to lack that ability. (Edit: He has recognition without understanding of things related to ""Da Boss"" - if Lock reads the wiz's name, Lock knows it's referring to the wizard, but still cannot say what the name is.)  So, please go ahead and name the wizard :)  Just don't tell me, because I can't know it ;)  Kidding.  Go ahead and decide who the wizard is.  Let it be a surprise to me.  Since the wizard's been gone so long, it's going to be a Big Thing‚Ñ¢ for Lock if the wizard reappears, obviously, and I'd like to use the wonder of discovery in my RP.  As a suggestion, you might just leave the wizard in a nebulous state until the time comes you need someone to move the story forward - that way the wizard is whoever you need the wizard to be with no retconning needed.  &gt;So...was my shifting thing appropriate? the rolling mechanic? I figured it would give you something to have to work for. I thought that limiting his times he can shapeshift a day. What do you think?  I see the rolling mechanic as completely appropriate / fair from what we were trying to do before (wedge in Powers), but it doesn't fit with my idea of Lock very well. We can easily say that if he wants to take the shape of something that's living - like a mannequin, statue of a dog, or a dead tree - it's like if another Shapeshifter tried to be a table.  ""Several actions, or even minutes, depending on _how_"" close to the imitated thing Lock's trying to get.  That fits perfectly.  Like I'd said, Lock doesn't ""get"" people and doesn't really have the capacity to want to (or after several hundred years, he'd've figured it out).  Also, I don't see the Skill Shuffle of True Shapeshifting being appropriate, really.  Is a dresser more or less Alert than a mannequin?   The only things I can see making sense are some of the physical ones (Might, Endurance, Stealth) but I'd imagined using Modular Abilities for those anyhow.  So only inanimate objects and no Skill Shuffle for a savings of (+1).  Is that enough, you think?  I _do_ think he needs to ""sleep"" just like everyone else with Good Endurance would have to, though.  If he gets hurt, it's going to take time and rest for him to ""heal.""  Essentially, there's nothing differentiating Lock form a human with Lock's powers except Lock isn't human.  I also am 100% behind him reverting to a stone archway with a heavy metal-bound wooden door in it if his refresh drops to zero.  Totally appropriate, and I trust you to only do this for plot purposes.  Does that seem fair to you?  Are you going to be ok with this guy running around your Gainesville?  ALSO:  What should I do about the Armor under Stress?  I didn't see rules for it.",‚Ñ¢

t5_2u45t,Elliptical_Tangent,1339001608,"&gt;I'm trying to wrap my head around how to let Lock do all that without being too powerful. Like I said, the shifting form limit per day, and then rest to replenish the number of shifts, was my initial plan. Is that still alright?  Well, let's talk about it.  What exactly are you concerned about with Lock that wouldn't concern you with a human(-oid) True Shapeshifting character that was morphing into cobras and porpoises?  &gt;Let's NOT have Lock's existence depend on the Wizard's life. Let's just say that the Wizard put in a measure of will into Locke's creation, but essentially created a life. Lock is an independently ""living"" magical creature. Who knows if the wizard's alive.  OK.  &gt;Would Locke know his master if they were face to face? Since he doesn't know anything about the wizard?  Yes, Lock can recognize things about his master but can't understand anything so related.  A page could be written referring to the wizard by name multiple times.  Lock will know this story involves the wizard, but will not be able to say the wizard's name, or any details revealed about the wizard, even though it's right there on the page in front of Lock.  If the wizard appears in Lock's perception, Lock will immediately recognize the wizard without being able to say if they're male or female, tall or short, black or white, etc.  Think of it like when Prince was known by that glyph.  Lock sees the wizard as a glyph that isn't translatable into language.  By design.  &gt;Would Locke know his master if they were face to face? Since he doesn't know anything about the wizard? Social and mental skills cannot be raised via shapechanging according to the book. The skill shuffle only applied to physical skills (like might or athletics)...but since Lock's new forms don't have much by way of physical abilities anyway (i.e. chairs and dressers) let's just let him had modular abilities that he can summon.  Yup, agreed.  Lock's True Shapeshifting is 99.9% cosmetics, it's the Modular Abilities that allows him to do stuff.  &gt;Just remember, make sure that Lock's going to be able to travel with the group as you make shifting decisions (damn, the word shift's gonna throw me off, the term ""shift"" applies in game to the number you are above and below difficulty rolls, too :p How about we call them ""mimics""?). I don't know if anyone's going to have a good time with the character if he's stuck in the shop all the time.  Not a problem, except that he's going to mess up people's cars.  If they're going somewhere, Lock can just stroll along as an endtable or whatever, freezing when someone not in the know comes into view.  He could also be a kid's wagon that people can assume is being pulled by one of the other PCs.  Or a wheelchair one of the PCs sits in. Or a bicycle.  Or a hipster steampunk Segway‚Ñ¢.  Or the relatively tame mannequin in a trenchcoat and fedora.  The possibilities are endless.",‚Ñ¢

t5_2qhn5,PUNKporVIDA,1339049183,"Free Press Summer Fest: A Clusterfuck. Sponsored by Jeep¬Æ    I've excitedly attended Free Press Summer Fests numbers one, three and four. However, so many things went wrong this year that I will not return no matter how good the booking is.   You Shall Not Pass:  The amount of space that FPSF let Jeep Purchase for their ""Off Road/Suspension Test Track"" was much too large. On Saturday it made getting from Stage 1 to Stage 2 a twenty minute ordeal. I understand that part of Houston culture is the acceptance of unreasonable amounts of traffic, and the general malaise that accompanies it. However, at a festival twenty minutes is not an admissible amount of time to move one city block. This is especially true when artists are playing back to back and patrons must optimize their schedules accordingly.  ""Work""? Hardly.  I did not have a single positive experience with anyone that worked at the festival. Competency clearly was not a factor in choosing those who represented FPSF. In addition, security was a joke. Both days my bag was not searched. On day one I could have very easily entered the festival without a ticket. I'm not sure if the employee was new to the idea of a bar code scanner, but the lines may as well have been self serve. I had to very nearly help the person scan my ticket.  Houston: The Gutter of Texas.  The complete and utter disregard for cleanliness and proper trash disposal at the fest was appalling. I saw several people slip and fall because trash was piled up so high in the walkways. To my knowledge some fests giveaway festival t-shirts to volunteers who collect trash. You should consider adopting this practice. Consider creative options like this to reduce the amount of garbage that cover the festival grounds. At the very least hire a greater staff of people who are dedicated to garbage collection.  The Infamous Golf Cart:  I've already talked about what a nightmare the Jeep Ad created to the flow of traffic. The golf carts that were added to the mix turned the annoying bottleneck into an impasse. There was one golf cart driver in particular who was exceedingly bold. This gentleman drove his golf cart THROUGH THE CROWD at stage 5 several times while various artists were performing. Not only was this incredibly disrespectful to the artists; it was also unacceptably inconsiderate to the ticket purchasing attendees.  Afrojack &gt; Flaming Lips? Srsly?  Rookie Mistake.   In summation, While I did enjoy many of the musical acts that I witnessed at FPSF 4. The amount and magnitude of annoyances were enough to destroy my desire to attend this festival again. Ever.",¬Æ

I also wanted to try and game the moody dwarf system by making all of the dorfs dabbling armorers or weaponsmiths with the wood and copper nuggets I brought along.   I chose an untamed wilds coastline with a terrifying ocean. Built a mini fort (wooden wall around the stairs down to food storage) and started the training.

It's pretty unconvincing.  &gt; **While genetically identical**, ergo they‚Äôre still the same lizards, the new lizards on the island were larger, but with shorter rear legs, a lower run speed, and a lessened response to potential predators. All of this because of a diet shift to plant focus, and significant gains in foliage protection. **These lizards reproduced like wild fire, and over a 30 year period developed huge adaptations that, because they allowed the lizard to survive better, were passed on to new lizards, and became normal traits**.  You contradicted yourself.

Before I begin, like with any sect of Christianity, there are strict places and there are liberal places. I am in The Netherlands, so my answers might be leaning more to the liberal side.  Socializing with non-believers is discouraged but not forbidden. This goes for professional and private association. The idea is that people on the inside are *obviously* much better association since they believe the same thing.  Disagreeing with doctrines is something I think a lot of Witnesses do, but they'll never talk about it and will deny it in the strongest possible terms. You can't actually disagree in the open, because the overarching organization claims that they have a direct link to God. Doubting their words would mean doubting God.  Witnesses can't get involved in wars, politics and patriotism. Once I saw an article that basically said: ""You *may* vote, but True Christians¬Æ would not due this because x, y and z.""  Running for leadership within the JWs is encouraged as long as ""running"" means doing your stinking best to adhere to the rules. First you'll get so-called ""privileges"", which means you get to distribute magazines or take care of the sound in their churches (known to them as Kingdom Halls). Reaching a higher position in an outside organization is allowed but not encouraged because it takes away time from worship and going door-to-door.  Arms for self-protection are not allowed either because guns kill and killing is bad. Any True Christian¬Æ would therefore avoid guns at all costs, including any professions that require you to carry arms.  Gambling, smoking, tattoos, piercings and getting drunk is forbidden. In fact, people who are on the outside are often depicted in their pictures as people who do that all the time. Anything with blood transfusions is forbidden as well, even if it kills you, though over the past few decades those rules have become more lenient. Yoga is considered to be opening your mind to demons. Pretty much all this eastern stuff is considered religious and therefore demonic.  Reading publications from other religions is not forbidden but only if it is done so you can prepare yourself to refute it. Reading apostate literature is forbidden. The organization is very tight on information control, you see. Supporting other churches is a no-no too because those are different religions and therefore part of Satan's world.  Marriage is considered holy and only done in the city hall with a speech before or after by a member in their local Kingdom Hall. The only valid reasons to divorce is death and cheating on your spouse. You can be homosexual, just don't you dare act on it.  Christian/Patriotic holidays may not be observed, except their own single holiday that remembers the death of Jesus Christ.   I'm at rule 100, but I am tired of going through it now, so I hope you got the picture.",¬Æ

The more creative they are, the more I have to work with in terms of story threads and juicy, juicy plot-meat, and I absolutely love turning all of those things into a cohesive - but always evolving - story. A good GM, I think, has the potential to be surprised by the turns *his own story* takes.  I also love how damn open-ended it is. I responded to you, OP, down below on this very subject, but suffice it to say when I'm on the player's side of the dice, I love being able to do literally anything I want, and when I'm on the GM's side, I love being able to create an adventure and a gaming world for my friends in any genre and setting I want, whether something licensed like *Star Wars* or *A Song of Ice and Fire*, or something completely of my own sadistic devising.  Once you get out of your shell and comfortable with playing a character with people, it's really just an incredibly enjoyable thing to share with friends. Even a ""bad"" session is usually one of the highlights of my week - you're sitting down with friends and pizza and beers and just telling an awesome story, collaboratively.  For getting into it: Grab a few friends who are willing, find a game that sounds like it's up your alley (there's nothing at all wrong with D&amp;D, but don't limit yourself if another setting sounds more appealing), and figure it out together. If your friends need convincing, tell them you'll pay for the pizza. Once everybody gets the ruleset down and starts getting into it, they'll be hooked and you can let them bring the snacks. Of course, if you're the driving force who's dragging everyone to the table at first, you'll probably default into the GM position, so just be prepared for that.

t5_2tkk8,bongface,1339121487,"It's good you're wanting to wean off the subs.  It seems like some people who are on a long-term course have a very hard time getting off, or end up with nasty after-effects.  I feel like suboxone really should be used as ""short"" term therapy with tapering and then discontinuation as the immediate goal, and not as long term maintenance like methadone.  I want to avoid giving ""medical advice"" since I can't back it up with anything that isn't anecdotal, but with buprenorphine I'd say weekly reductions are reasonable.  The feelings of ""normalization"" that some people get from bupe can be difficult to let go of, so it's be good to give your mind and body time to acclimate while tapering your dose.  Since you're using a relatively low dose (compared to what is often prescribed to heavy users), it shouldn't take you too long to get off.  I'd start by figuring out your lowest ""functional"" dose and sticking with it for, say, a week.  Do not let yourself take anything higher than that stated dose.  No excuses or exceptions.  This should help you get in the mindset that you'll need from here on out without assaulting your body quite yet.  I'd then move to 75% of that dose for a week, and 50% the week after.  Then halve that dose each week until you're taking an absurdly small amount of material.  For the smoothest transition I'd go until you're taking just a speck each day.  When you reach a week where it seems unreasonable to halve your dose, stop taking it.  How easy this is might depend on if you have the strips or tablets though.  I've never encountered the tablets, but I'd think that crushing them and dividing the powder shouldn't be TOO hard.  It may be easier to manage your dose my making a solution however.  For example you could dissolve 1mg for every 5ml of water, and divide your doses accordingly.  If you do this, be sure to not use too much liquid as you want to be able to easily hold it under your tongue.  I'd keep it there for at least 15min before swallowing, occasionally moving it around to make sure everything absorbs.  Accurate measurement is key to maintaining the correct dose too.  A small needless syringe with volumetric markings would be good, though an adjustable-volume pipette would be better.  There are many sources of information on what to do with yourself after you're done, and I'll leave that advice to better authorities.  I only just read ThrowAwayBroadway's response on here, and there's a lot of good info there.  I will add a couple suggestions though.  I'm all about herbal and nutritional supplementation, they really can do a lot of good.  A quality magnesium supplement helps relax muscles, regulate a stressed nervous system, and can relieve constipation (Magnesium Citrate is sold for this very purpose).  I believe Magnesium Chelate is the best, especially for reaching muscle, brain, and nerve tissue.  Gycinate, Gluconate, and Citrate should be good too.  Don't bother with the Oxide.  A balanced calcium/magnesium/phosphorus supplement is not a bad idea either, but most have a larger proportion of calcium than you probably want.  Epsom salts (Magnesium Sulfate) are great for both a nice relaxing bath.  Taking too much magnesium can cause or worsen diarrhea though.  If that happens I'd add a calcium supplement.  For sleep and relaxation try valerian or kava kava.  Chamomile, hops, passion flower, sublingual GABA, and L-theanine are good too.  Melatonin can also work wonders for inducing sleep and correcting your sleep cycle, plus it's neuroprotective.  I definitely recommend it.  Extended, regular use becomes ineffective though so it's better just to use it to get your cycle back on track.  If you need an alternative to prescription benzodiazapines, maybe try phenibut.  Some people find that kratom is an effective opiate replacement (it seems to have mu-Opioid receptor activity), but tread carefully as you can get addicted to that instead.  A multivitamin is probably good, though personally I feel like many formulas are not great.  Vitamin C and a B-complex are probably the most useful.  With any of those supplements it's important to use a high quality product.  Most store brands are complete shit.  For example I've found HerbPharm's glycerine based valerian extract to be quite effective, but I took 16 store bought capsules of root powder and felt nothing.

t5_2qh1o,amikez,1339133309,"Ok, I wasn't going to respond, but I feel the previous sentiment requires some clarification.  To be clear, the original 'put it outside' was part joke, part serious, and part troll (I'm not proud).  Obviously, this is an incredibly young puppy and I'm assuming mom and/or siblings are not around, and I would NOT seriously advocate putting this young of a puppy outside by itself.  If my original comment was taken as completely serious, then I apologize for not using the '/s' tag.  First and foremost, I have **loved** all the dogs I have owned and trained over the years.  From the pit bulls to ridgebacks, border collies, labs, german shorthairs, and the mutts.  Have loved them all.  Favorite has to be pit bulls, they are fantastic and loving family dogs and they get a bad rep.  It irks me to no end that some towns actually ban the breed (other rant for another time).  But sleeping on the ground with your puppy is generally NOT the answer.  I'm glad to hear that OP's puppy has taken to their crate training without issue after the first couple nights, that is FANTASTIC, but an atypical route.  Encouraging your dog to cry for attention (even itty bitty puppies) is usually a recipe for disaster.  In this instance it is not, so I leave it.  Second, dogs - despite all the love we all heap on them - are NOT family/friends.  They can't make you a cup of coffee, they can't send an email for you, and they can't offer you advice on relationships, work, or life in general.  You know who can do all/any of those things?  ACTUAL family and friends.  Granted, it might not be good advice or good coffee or a proper missive, but this is more about ability than quality.  Dogs are NOT your kids and should never receive the same kind of love that your kids do.  The first two years might seem the same, but there needs to be a mental separation made; dogs (pets) =/= family (humans).  Do they deserve protection from abuse and some basic rights, like not be killed for simply being unowned? Of course.  Do they need to sleep on your bed or share your ice cream cone? No.  That all said, my serious advice for a puppy of this age that wouldn't stop crying would be to crate it or put it in a pen of its own with food, water, training pad, and thick blanket or personal dog bed.  **tl:dr** Don't actually put your 6 week old puppy outside by itself, I was joking, sorry I wasn't clear.

Social work students come from all walks of life, she said, and have the ability to combine their skills and transfer them into nontraditional jobs.  &gt;‚ÄúThe idea of a social worker in nontraditional placement is intriguing for many people,‚Äù Bravo said. ‚ÄúManagement, consulting, financial and life coaching, business-social enterprise, education, human resources, law, marketing and fundraising are some of the nontraditional fields (where) social workers can find employment.‚Äù  &gt;Dual degrees  &gt;Dual degree programs offered at schools of social work are another way to open new career paths for MSW graduates.  &gt;‚ÄúOne of the dual degrees we offer at our school of social work is in urban planning, for example, in addition to our other programs,‚Äù said Mike Spencer, associate dean and professor of social work at the University of Michigan. ‚ÄúThe (dual degrees) can double job prospects for an MSW graduate.‚Äù  &gt;‚ÄúThere are various reasons students seek a joint degree with their MSW education,‚Äù said Melissa Bottiglio, associate director of admissions and recruitment at the School of Social Policy &amp; Practice at the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn). ‚ÄúSocial work is already an interdisciplinary field with scholars having differing career goals or desires to create change in particular sectors of society.‚Äù  &gt;Bottiglio said bioethics is one dual degree social work program UPenn offers, which can extend opportunities in the health care sector for graduates.  &gt;‚ÄúThe MSW/MBE (Master of Social Work/Master of Bioethics) aims to prepare students to be leaders in bioethics-related, research-based program and policy venues in the social services, life sciences and medicine,‚Äù Bottiglio said. ‚ÄúThe MBE program is designed to provide its graduates with the interdisciplinary training they will need in order to address the moral challenges in health care today and tomorrow.‚Äù  &gt;Perfecta Lancenski, a student enrolled in the MSW/Master of Public Administration program at UPenn, says obtaining a dual degree in social work sets her up to tackle a wide array of social issues she may come across in any position she gets.  &gt;‚ÄúHaving both degrees allows me to have a more holistic understanding of social problems as well as practical skills in how to address them,‚Äù Lancenski said. ‚ÄúAnd given how complex and seemingly intractable social problems can be, I‚Äôm glad I feel more prepared.‚Äù  From June 2012 NASW News. ¬© 2012 National Association of Social Workers.",¬©

Later today, the following updates will be made to the Terms of Use available on our website, and when the real-money auction house goes live, all players will be asked to re-read and accept these changes the next time they play Diablo III.  Battle.net Balance and Authenticator Update With the introduction of the real-money auction house, account security will become more important than ever. To help ensure that players have a positive experience when using the real-money auction house, we‚Äôve made some adjustments to how players can use and access their Battle.net Balance.   Starting today, in order to use Battle.net Balance, players will be required to have a Battle.net Authenticator or Battle.net Mobile Authenticator attached to their Battle.net account. For clarity, this means you‚Äôll need to have an Authenticator to add to your balance via Battle.net Account Management or to send the proceeds of your real-money auction house sales to your Battle.net Balance.  Please note that players who previously added Battle.net Balance to their account prior to this change will be able to use it to make eligible purchases on Battle.net and in the auction house without attaching an Authenticator. However, an Authenticator will be required to add to your balance in the future, as explained above.  While we understand that this may be an inconvenience for some players, we want to ensure that players feel confident when using Battle.net Balance to make auction house transactions.   You can learn more about the Battle.net Authenticator, Battle.net Mobile Authenticator, and other account security information by clicking here.",¬Æ

t5_2qh1i,meatwad75892,1339175833,"1. Yes, we do.  Beer pong is to drinking as baseball is to sports.  It's a great past-time, some American kids start playing in high school and it continues through college, so the game itself is quite nostalgic for some. It's always extremely fun to play, but rarely fun to watch.  While it is counter-intuitive to make someone else drink, but it's usually fun to make other people get drunk, especially when it's their own drinks. If you're a ""good player"", as I *think* I am, I usually have a side drink to make up for what I don't drink in the game. About 1 beer per game if they go by quickly.   2. Yep, true stereotype I guess.  It's also less incriminating if you're out at a bonfire or something and a county sheriff rolls up. It's easier to toss a red cup than try to explain 10 empty Budweiser cans around you.  And if you bring any other brand of cups other than Solo, odds are you will be hated and picked on for it. Solo has the perfect height, width, weight, balance, and durability that store-brands and other brands just can't rival.   3. If someone is worried about wasted beer or money, they probably shouldn't be buying kegs in the first place. No one likes a Beer Nazi. My deal is, let everyone try and have a good time!  If you supply alcohol, don't bitch and gripe when people use it.  If I throw a party, it's usually BYOB(bring your own beer). But maybe twice a year, I have a big blowout where I save up and supply everything. Everyone is my guest, no one goes thirsty and no one is told ""no"" in their own personal alcolympics.   4. I live in Mississippi. Bars in city limits shut down at 1am, and bars outside city limits close at 3am.  [Waffle House](http://www.wafflehouse.com/) is a 50/50 chance afterwards, it depends on whether or not someone in your group is too trashed or missing or bleeding to death.   5. Pretty much any ""light"" beer is insanely popular for binge drinking.  People will gripe over Bud Light, Miller Lite, Coors Light, etc. Some people will drink one religiously, and never touch the other. It's quite funny to watch because they're all shit at the end of the day.  For casual drinking, many people do thankfully go for better beers and microbrews.

""Super weeds"" is term used by individuals who didn't understand there were resistant weeds prior and are looking for a scapegoat. Good to know you fall into that crowd. Again, how does that prove any responsibility on Monsanto's part?  3. There are other herbicides out there, invented by other companies. Different is not more. Appropriate herbicide use does not ""poison"" the land. Poisoned ground won't grow crops so that would be problematic for farmers. Your entire assertion here is completely false.  4. You've not refuted anything I've said, only ignored it. That's not how intelligent debate works.  You may have noticed how they recently released RoundReady2 and RoundUp 2. Monsanto knew it would happen and had a product sitting on the shelves to sell when it did. Almost like they're really good at this, isn't it? Shocking how people that do something are better at it than those that sit around making stuff up.  Did you even read your second link? It specifically mentions a weed with triple resistance, none of which are Monsanto caused.  http://www.extension.purdue.edu/extmedia/gwc/gwc-1.pdf ""Waterhemp infests millions of Midwest corn and soybean acres, and most waterhemp populations are already resistant to ALS-inhibitingherbicides (Raptor¬Æ, Pursuit¬Æ, and others). There are also waterhemp populations resistant to PPO herbicides (Flexstar¬Æ, Cobra¬Æ, and others) and triazine herbicides (Sencor¬Æ, atrazine, and others). One Illinois farm has a waterhemp population with three-way resistance (ALS, PPO, and triazine). All the resistance and it's not glyphosate resistant. ....But, but, but Monsanto is the boogeyman  So yet again, you've contradicted yourself. It's now moved beyond uneducated, to simply sad. You have no idea what you are talking about but have convinced yourself you know where to place blame.  The only silence is happening between your ears where most people have intelligent thoughts.   Thanks for not reading your links, saves me from having to link to stuff that proves you wrong. Since you don't seem to get this, I'm not arguing that there are no weeds resistant to glyphosate/RoundUp, I'm saying weed resistance happened before Monsanto and to act like they deserve the blame is idiotic.",¬Æ

What set‚Äôs the Denon DJ SC2900 apart from the conventional ‚Äúclub CDJ‚Äù is its leap forward in display technologies with the introduction of the ‚ÄòEclipse‚Äô platter with glowing LED markers that surround the circumference; enabling a very clear and elegant method of accurately displaying ‚ÄòCue Point‚Äô and ‚ÄòPlayback‚Äô markers. Combined with the ENGINE for iPad¬Æ App means that a networked iPad becomes the biggest and most versatile media navigation screen in the industry, giving every DJ a powerful way to manage tracks and playlists, ready to perform, all through the iPad touchscreen.  The button layout reflects that of the popular SC3900 with a bank of Loops and Cues top left of the platter for throwing down samples and top right are the navigation controls ensuring the fastest access to the DJing essentials. Similarly reflecting the same newly redesigned ‚ÄòHard‚Äô Cue and Play buttons with the only significant layout change to be the ‚ÄòSLIP‚Äô button which replaces the SC3900s ‚ÄòDUMP‚Äô button: for reverse, loop, and scratch whilst continuing playback at the same rhythm and point that would have been reached prior to pushing ‚Äòslip‚Äô ‚Äì an essential editing feature in the studio and the booth for dropping out inappropriate lyrics without disturbing the flow of music.   Denon DJs heritage in Professional DJ Equipment married with new developments in software leaves the SC2900 as a true consideration in the Professional, Studio and Club DJ market. From the more traditional CD DJs, through portable USB media and connectivity to the latest in software or even network sharing makes the Denon DJ SC2900 the choice, whatever the style of DJ and whatever the occasion.    It‚Äôs time for change.   Full info here: http://www.dm-pro.eu/en/denondj/product ... ia-player/",¬Æ

And obviously tell exactly this conversation you had with her mother, don't hide anything. And tell her how much you care about her well-being, okay? Everything is going to be okay.   You may present a relationship as a possibility for her to have an easier time (or just because you like her), but be careful to not hurt her feelings in this process. If you aren't into her, don't let her develop romantic feelings for you.  How old is she? If she is going to confront her parents on this (and she has every right to do so), it may be wiser for her to wait until she is independent financially. In this case she will need as much support she can get, and you can make a difference on her life.

Oh! I found this fantastic deli downtown, that just got put in on the corner of Garden and West. You know, where the old alligator repair shop used to be? Yeah, that place went out of business. Surprisingly, it wasn't because of a lack of customers. I hear the owner, Mr. Phlegm, was involved in some sort of international conspiracy that had something to do with all those Russian exchange students that were arrested last month. So he got taken off to jail or something and they tore down the alligator repair shop, which kind of irks me because my alligator was still in there. It was giving me problems, so I gave it to Mr. Phlegm, and he told me it was nothing serious, like a couple of loose belts and maybe a rusted sparkplug or two. Well, he had to order the parts and stuff so he told me it wouldn't be ready until Tuesday, and then all of a sudden guys from the CIA are asking him to go with them to Washington. At least, I think they were with the CIA. My friends tell me that everybody in the CIA wears a black ski mask. One of the guys had pantyhose on his head, so I guess he was probably with the FBI. I'm pretty sure everybody in the FBI carries a flamethrower, and I know for a fact that they always set fire to people when they arrest them. I guess it was pretty important that they knew who I was, because they asked for my wallet to make sure I had proper identification.

That's when I met the wonderful person who changed my life... a beautiful nurse that would be my ray of sunshine in my darkest days. I'll never forget that nurse's name: Stewart.

t5_2qh16,thoomfish,1339263116,"Here's one example:  OS X is vastly smarter about the distribution of keyboard shortcuts than Windows (and by extension Linux, since most Linux desktop environments copy their hotkeys directly from Windows), and will always be because Windows dug itself into such a deep hole so early in its life. On Windows, keyboard shortcuts are divided haphazardly between Ctrl and Alt when there's no real reason to do so. The Windows key is sort of there, and has the occasional handy use (like the Aero Snap shortcuts), but is mostly vestigial.  On OS X, nearly all keyboard shortcuts are on the Command key, with Ctrl and Alt modifying Command key shortcuts. This frees up the other two keys to do incredibly useful things that are a pain in the ass on other operating systems. For example, the Ctrl key can be used system-wide with a variety of Emacs text-editing shortcuts. If I want to go to the beginning or end of a line, or back or forward a character on any Mac, my fingers never have to leave the home row, whereas on a Windows system I have to lift my right hand and move it over to that awkward home/end/arrowkey conglomerate.  Likewise, on OS X, Alt is used for accessing alternate glyphs when typing. For example, Alt-g produces ¬©, Alt-e gives the next typed character a forward accent (as in √≠, produced by Alt-e, i), etc. How do you produce those same characters on Windows? Memorize a giant table of four digit codes and pray your computer has an easily accessible number pad. ",¬©

t5_2qio8,koviko,1339266628,"**tl;dr** Depends on how well you can avoid damage. If you can avoid most if not all damage, you want low resil. If you can't, you want high resil. In arena, Arcane 4.5k+, Fire 4k+, Frost 3k+.  ##How does resilience work?  Resilience reduces the amount of damage that you take from enemy players in PvP. Back in the day, it used to reduce your chance of getting crit, but Blizzard changed it to be a pure damage reduction. Basically, **1% resilience** makes you take **1% less damage** from an enemy player. This is applied after all other things are considered (power of the attacker, armor and resistances of the victim, etc). At max level, 1% resilience is a little less than 100 resilience rating. For simplification, assume that 1% is 100 resilience rating. So, 2000 resilience reduces incoming attacks by about 20% and 4000 resilience reduces incoming attacks by about 40%.  The simplest way to show the value of this is that if you take 40% less damage, you survive 40% longer without any healing. Once you count healing into the equation, you have to consider that heals only matter if you are still alive. As long as you are above 0% health, you are eligible for healing. The longer you can stay alive, the more heals you can receive.  ##Resilience for ranged classes  Ranged classes are meant to be high-damage/low-defense classes (with the exception of Hunters being medium-defense, but having very few damage mitigation and healing techniques). The amount of resilience you need becomes a matter of how many times you will get hit. This means that **the harder it is to hit you, the less resilience you need** in order to stay above 0% health. Warriors get hit the entire time they are in combat, so they require high resilience. However, Rogues are able to avoid a lot of damage, so many opt for low resilience.  The tradeoff is damage ‚Üî resilience. If you are trading resilience for a different defensive stat, then you are wasting your time since resilience would be more beneficial. You want to trade resilience for damage, as that is the key to theoretically ""reducing"" the damage you take by killing your opponent. A dead opponent does 0 DPS.  When you are at range, you should theoretically be able to avoid damage easier than a melee class. As such, you want to embrace your high-damage by trading resilience for more damage. However, this isn't always the case. For example, Warlocks are a ranged class who's primary deflector for avoiding damage is Fear, but diminishing returns can reduce it's effectiveness to 0 after the third Fear. At this point, if they don't have a well-placed teleport available, they will find themselves taking a lot more damage than intended/  ##When you need resilience and when you do not  As a Mage, it is tricky to definitively say how much resilience you need. The idea is that, if you are going to get hit a lot, you need a lot of resilience. If not, you don't. However, this changes depending on the setting.  In random Battlegrounds, you will find it easy to hide behind other players, almost to the point that you never get attacked at all. If you can avoid all attacks altogether, then you don't need any resilience at all. You can sit in the back spamming Arcane Blast in full Heroic T13 gear and end up with better stats than the rest of the players in the battleground.  In Rated Battlegrounds, the amount of resilience depends on how likely of a target you are and how easily you can be saved. If you draw a lot of attention to yourself (overextending, playing Arcane, getting big Combustions), then you will become a prime target. If not, then you can get away with more damage. I find low resilience in RBGs only really works as Frost though, and even then, you only use low resilience for big fights and then switch back to your high resilience gear when defending a node.  In Arenas, you want higher resilience. Depending on your spec, the exact amount will differ depending on how easily you can avoid damage. **You will always be a target in Arenas**, so you have to be able to protect yourself. Arcane will have trouble avoiding damage, so you want a high amount of resilience (around 4.5k). As Fire, you will find yourself taking damage from melee occasionally, so you want a decent amount of resilience  to allow you to tank a few hits (4k ish). As Frost, your freezes can be utilized to avoid most melee damage and your Ice Barrier will protect you from most ranged damage, so you can get away with low resilience (3k ish). However, if you find yourself getting trained by Rogue/Druids catching you while they are stealthed, then you may opt for higher resilience in order to survive their openers.",‚Üî

These include sympatry with a compatible relative (weedy, wild or crop), synchrony of flowering, successful fertilization and viable offspring. The chance of these events occurring is real; however, it is generally low and varies with species and circumstances. Plants of the same species (non-transgenic or with a different HR transgene) in neighbouring fields may inherit the new HR gene, potentially generating plants with single and multiple HR. For canola, seed losses at harvest and secondary dormancy ensures the persistence over time of the HR trait(s) in the seed bank, and the potential presence of crop volunteers in subsequent crops. Although canola has many wild/weedy relatives, the risk of gene flow is quite low for most of these species, except with Brassica rapa L. Introgression of genes and transgenes in B rapa populations occurs with apparently little or no fitness costs. Consequences of HR canola gene flow for the agro-ecosystem include contamination of seed lots, potentially more complex and costly control strategy, and limitations in cropping system design. Consequences for non-agricultural habitats may be minor but appear largely undocumented.

t5_2qh1i,23zombies,1339320359,"I was 18 when I attempted, too. It's actually related to the experience I came here to explain. It's kind of embarrassing for me to admit, but last year, I was in a really terrible place in life emotionally/mentally. I began drinking heavily almost every weekend, Thursday night through Sunday night, to cope. One Friday night, I drank waaay beyond my limit, and the doctor said something about I might have possibly been drugged (I'm fuzzy on the details because of how medicated I was). My friends called my boyfriend who came with his father (a doctor) and they took me to the hospital. I spent the majority of the weekend in an induced coma. I was told my BAC was .217. Looking back on it, I just feel stupid. I feel shame for having done that to myself. I've blacked out more times than I'd like to admit, and as fucking stupid as it sounds, almost dying from the alcohol poisoning wasn't enough to stop me from drinking. I've cut back recently but still have my nights that turn into regrets the next day. Every day is a battle, I suppose.  Onto the suicide attempt: after coming home from the hospital that Sunday evening, I was still so heavily medicated that I barely remember this happening. That Monday night, I attempted to hang myself, but failed somehow and texted my friend about it, who texted my boyfriend, who called my mom. My mother, stepfather, and boyfriend drove me to the emergency room, and I was admitted to the psych ward the next morning. I spent Tuesday through Friday morning there and was home in time that Friday to attend my senior prom :)  It's been over a year and I wish I could say I came out on top and am living so much happier now but honestly, it's not true. Yes, I am doing better in some instances, but like I previously said, every day is a battle.  As anonymous as this is, stranger to stranger, I'm happy you're still around.

t5_2qixm,irregardless,1339326096,"&gt; why did the Enterprise series do so badly?  Because not enough people watched it.   Bottom line, TV is all about money. If the show had big enough ratings, UPN would have hung onto it. If Enterprise had been able to capture the popular imagination (and thus viewership) the same way The Next Generation had, UPN would have been all over it.   At its peak of 11 million viewers, TNG was a mainstream hit show. Enterprise by contrast, was down to 2-3 million by season 4.  Part of the reason was UPN itself. UPN didn't serve as many homes as the bigger networks, so if you didn't get UPN in your market, you didn't watch Star Trek (or you hoped an independent station carried the show). Also, Voyager was the flagship program on the network, but it didn't receive any halo benefits from other programming. UPN was a bunch of crap (and Star Trek), and the franchise suffered because of it.  The producers deserve a lot of blame as well. By the time Enterprise was on the air, Star Trek had ceased to be exciting (enjoyable, yes, but it was no longer doing Great Things‚Ñ¢). The franchise was almost rote. Voyager, Insurrection and Nemesis all failed to satisfy the hardcore fan. And the hardcore fans were  losing their enthusiasm. And it's the fan's enthusiasm that often persuades the casual viewer to tune in.  The 11 million viewers that watched TNG weren't hardcore fans; they were the fans plus the viewers they brought with them. Star Trek needs both the fans and the casual viewers to survive. It's the only way to get ratings that are good enough to justify the franchise's production costs.  But the fans themselves aren't blameless. In fact, I think the fans are sometimes the franchise's worst enemy. They are notoriously *impossible* to please. Since the first season of TNG, there have been vocal segments of the fanbase bitching about something or other in the franchise.  TNG at the beginning was not well received by many fans of the original series. Kirk vs Picard arguments flared up constantly. Deep Space Nine's reputation has largely been rehabilitated, but at the time of its airing, it was vocally criticized by many fans. And don't bring up Voyager. There are fans who hated it from the day it began and who still hate it today (try defending it here at r/startrek and see what happens).   When the hard-core fans are constantly complaining about the franchise, it's hard to convince the casual viewer to tune in.  So over time, the franchise started to lose the hardcore fans. They might have been tuning in themselves, but they weren't telling their friends to. They may have actually discouraged it by spreading the idea that Star Trek wasn't worth watching anymore. Without the casual audience, ratings suffer. By Enterprise's midpoint, all that were left were the diehards.  Of course, arguably, ""better storytelling"" would have kept the excitement level higher among fans. But the problem here is Star Trek's own Kobayashi Maru. With all of its baggage, history, canon and expectations, the hurdle is already high for anything with Star Trek's name on it. One fan's ""better storytelling"" is another fan's boring tripe. And it is the complainers who are heard the loudest. It becomes the no-win scenario for the producers.",‚Ñ¢
t5_2qpp6,gizzomizzo,1339329821,"That blacks are disadvantaged economically is a social truth I'm well aware of and well versed in (4 or 5 credit hours away from a degree, albeit a useless one).  Racism isn't just a synonym for racial superiority. The comment section of a post about MLG isn't quite the place to have a real conversation about this but let's just say that me being who I am (a warcraft/starcraft nerd from the almost-not-quite-hood) I've had a disproportionate amount of experience with the type of suburban white kid from a monochromatic neighborhood who could easily read this an truly believe ""Well, yeah, it makes sense that there aren't a lot of black SC2 players because they can't afford games, subscriptions, and computers.""  Are there a lot of black people who can't? Yes. Are there a lot of white people that can't? Yes. If I said ""There aren't a lot of white superstar basketball players because white people just aren't that good at basketball and aren't as athletic"", that argument would be just as specious.  I know right now I'm looking like the Angry Black Man ¬© and that's cool, but it's annoying that regardless of what subreddit I'm in or what the conversation may be, seeing more psuedo-progressive bullshit guised as a matter-of-fact social reality just gets tiresome. Not because in this one instant it's a big deal, but maybe somebody reads this then the conversation comes up and he repeats it, or 20 years down the line some analogous situation presents itself and he tells his kid this shit. Not for one second would him or any of the 60-odd people who upvoted him consider that maybe the majority *have no interest whatsoever* in involving themselves in the community, but no, ""if they were affluent like myself there is no possible way they'd be underrepresented in this community so there must be some kind of socioeconomic cause at work"". It's the same justifications myself, my Hispanic friends, my Indian friends, etc hear a lot in conversations about race; Whites and East Asians are just really better situated for x, y, and z.  Yes, I might have overreacted, but damn. I'm not a combative person but it's something that offended me personally that I wouldn't expect to find in a thread about the noise level at MLG.   Edit: Sorry about this rambling, stream of conscious wall of text. It's 7 am and I haven't slept, my apologies. But, yes, as someone who has played Starcraft for ~12ish years and had many long ass conversations about it with black game geeks, it's a nerd hobby, and you have to be pretty secure (or cool or lacking self-awareness or whatever the case may be) to enjoy the community around it.",¬©

For casual users, Damn Near Anything‚Ñ¢ will be fast enough and there won't be much benefit in fast timing or extraordinary transfer speed.   You can think of the timing as the reaction speed and the Mhz as the transfer speed. If the software you're using is doing a lot of 'ping pong' quick and small transfers then you may benefit from tight timing. Not many operations are hindered by the actual transfer speed (memory bound), but on the surface I'd assume games to be in that area. In that case you may benefit more from a higher transfer speed than quicker timing.   Standard user applications tend to do smaller repeated access operations, so faster timing may benefit you more, as long as the actual transfer speed isn't unusually slow.

t5_2qhyq,captbaritone,1339345336,"I have a good (bad) one, but you will have to endure my Wall of Text‚Ñ¢  I'm a singer and I was in my morning church gig when I started to feel light-headed. I had to drop out in a few of hymns and sit down to catch my breath for fear that I was going to faint. I sneak out of the choir loft early to go use the bathroom, because I REALLY have to go and I have a matinee a 45 minute drive away that I have to get to. I absolutely punish the toilet, and thank God (if she will forgive me for slacking on the hymns) that everyone else is in the service still. Worst smell ever. Or so I thought.  I drive to my next gig. A production of Amahl and the Night Visitors in wich I was playing Melchior. The whole thing is a traveling production and we were in a church this afternoon. I'm milling around the church in my costume waiting for the show to start and I have really bad gas so I decide to step outside and let off a little pressure. Bad idea. Tiny fart becomes tiny shart. I sharted my pants in a my costume 5 minutes before we start. I book it for the bathroom. Unfortunately this is a church. There is no back-stage bathroom. Just the bathroom in the front of the church where the audience is assembling. Well, I gotta do what I gotta do. I tear in there and start cleaning myself up. I decide I better take a proper dump while I'm in there, and it's pure liquid. And the smell! Oh the smell! Well, at least I felt a little better in my stomach as I walked out.  Finally the audience was seated and the opera began. I was wating with the other two kings, seasoned pros, in the church lobby and they are making jokes about the poor soul who fumigated the bathroom and I laugh along with them at THAT POOR GUY. I don't have the guts to tell them it was me.  The opening scene continues and our grand entrance approaches and it finally beings to set in. I'm going to puke. Not now. But soon. Definatly before the opera is over. But music waits for no man. The opera had begun and... here comes our entrance music. I will never forget that moment. When I realized that I was waking onto a stage KNOWING I would not make it to the end of the opera.   We process on singing a trio. Every few measures I drop out to catch my breath. My stomach is in knots, my face is white, it hurts. All I can do is just FOCUS on not throwing up. We finanly make it to the stage and our characters are waiting to be let into the house. Very quickly it hits me. Now is the time. My body is shouting at me. YOU HAVE TO PUKE! I turn to the bass a whisper, in character ""I have to go."" He whispers back. ""Yes yes it's quite late out here"" in character. I lean in again ""No, I REALLY have to go."" He caught my meaning, paused and then ""Okay. Go."". I was abandoning the show. It was put together on very few rehearsals (only ONE for the bass) and the remaining singers would have to figure out the rest of the show on the fly without one of the key characters. And it didn't matter. I had to leave. I start walking back out the churh. Down the asile the way I had come. I have no idea what the audience thougth I was doing, but I didn't leave them in much suspense. I headed straight for the lobby bathroom, trying hard not to drop my king character. Once there I rushed the stall, and puked. And puked. And puked.   I had ruined the show. I let my stomach settle, stood up and washed out my mouth. And then I heard the music, my aria had not yet started. Only one thing to do, so I got to my feet took a deep breath, and processed out one more time. I rejoined the other kings with my best ""this is all part of the staging"" acting I could. Almost as soon as I arrived my aria began and I opened my mouth to sing. Surprsingly stomach acid doesn't do too much harm to the voice and sang fine!  I'm running out of time to write here (off to my church gig!) but the second act of this story involves me driving to our evening performance on some of California's windiest roads, puking again outside the next venue and having an almost exact repeat of the the earlier show. Left the stage to puke in the middle of the opera, headed for the toilet and puked my guts out. I then drove home (stoping to puke one more time) and crawled into bed and was sick for two days.  THE END.  TL;DR: Sang two operas in one day. Sharted my pants before my first entrance and puked during each.  Edit: Removed my pompous opening line.",‚Ñ¢

Initially experimenting by reverse-engineering Maglev trains during a brief stay in the Chinese mainland province of Tibet, he eventually travelled to Santa Fe, New Mexico in 2007, in order to find artists and creative folk who shared his same artistic vision of creating levitating portraitures.  After securing a grant from Google's short-lived and short-sighted X-Prize Earth sponsorship Elisuzuku was able to tour Moon Dog¬Æ ultrasonic levitation facilities throughout central Louisiana and there found inspiration for his current project's trajectory through use of a asynchronous jazz signatures and cacophonous use of the scientific trumpet-mute.

I would have liked to see him as an irascible anti-bender, but not a radical one, who teaches Chi-Blocking as a self-defense art. Something we can relate to, whose past has not overcome his sense of humanity (guns don't kill people, people kill people etc) so he teaches chi-blocking to everyone who comes to the class. He could even be lightly involved in an equalist movement, pushed forward by someone in actual power, like Hiroshi Sato. As a result, Asami has more of a conflict/Mako has more reason to be suspicious of their contrived ""surprise"" meeting.   She doesn't have to be evil, even better plotwise if she isn't, but she gets an even better schism, and Amon and Hiroshi Sato are great foils in terms of someone who can't let go of the past, and someone who has let go of his past, as opposed to right now.  Amon could even be part of the korra gang for brief periods, probably albeit with distaste or 'only to protect other people' or whatever. Maybe he even teaches Korra some chi-blocking when she or Mako come to his self-defense class.  With Hiroshi and Amon's forces growing, Hiroshi reveals he knows how to prevent bending for good, etc. However, the problem is not truly the benders in the city or the equalists at this point, it's the gangs. Hiroshi persuades Amon to help take down the gangs after the gangs make a coordinated attack on Amon's self-defense class because it is helping to protect the people they're extorting. Amon helps out, sees the act of taking away their bending, and looks uncomfortable with it.  Hiroshi proclaims it as a success, but Republic city shuts down Amon's defense classes after they find the connection between him and the Equalists. Amon is forced to go to Hiroshi for help, and he is slowly turned to Hiroshi's cause through a combination of his own stewing dislike of benders, and watching/hearing Tarrlok condemn equalists and calling him out as the chief equalist. (They would at this point not know about Hiroshi.)  A nice bit would be if he confronted Tarrlok, took him down, and Tarrlok bloodbended him into submission. Then somehow he manages to escape, but nobody believes the terrorist, which further spirals him deeper into becoming an equalist. Meanwhile, Hiroshi is watching his daughter playing with her bender friend, and is starting to regret what he is doing when confronted by actual humanity rather than rage.  Tarrlok continues with his engineering of overblown mccarthyism and restricting nonbenders, creating a larger and larger gap. Korra and gang attempt to stop him, but get arrested, Korra finding out he's a bloodbender and taken away.  In the finale, Hiroshi starts up his grand scheme along with Amon, and they take down Tarrlok. Hiroshi is alone with Tarrlok and gets bloodbended despite an attempt to break out of it. Korra's gang are trying to put together this holy fuck what is happening situation and put it back together again, but it's increasingly difficult. They stumble upon this situation after finding out that yes Tarrlok is a bloodbender, and Tarrlok bloodbends them too.   Hiroshi sees Asami, and through the power of Love‚Ñ¢ manages to break the bloodbending on him and with Jet-like determination, charges at Tarrlok before falling. (Alternatively, Hiroshi takes away Tarrlok's bending before dying and managing to say that he still loves Asami.) Amon finally arrives, only Korra (barely) conscious, and confronts Tarrlok (without his bending) and picks up the mask of Amon and puts it on.  Add in a lot of fight scenes, obviously. This way the first season could both end on a positive note with the completion of characters but also with the negative subtext of this new ""Amon"".",‚Ñ¢

Klyosov, Igor L. Rozhanskii KEYWORDS Y Chromosome; Mutations; Haplotypes; Haplogroups; TMRCA; STR; SNP; ‚ÄúOut of Africa‚Äù ABSTRACT Seven thousand five hundred fifty-six (7556) haplotypes of 46 subclades in 17 major haplogroups were considered in terms of their base (ancestral) haplotypes and timespans to their common ancestors, for the purposes of designing of time-balanced haplogroup tree. It was found that African haplogroup A (originated 132,000 ¬± 12,000 years before present) is very remote time-wise from all other haplogroups, which have a separate common ancestor, named Œ≤-haplogroup, and originated 64,000 ¬± 6000 ybp. It includes a family of Europeoid (Caucasoid) haplogroups from F through T that originated 58,000 ¬± 5000 ybp. A downstream common ancestor for haplogroup A and Œ≤-haplogroup, coined the Œ±-haplogroup emerged 160,000 ¬± 12,000 ybp. A territorial origin of haplogroups Œ±- and Œ≤-remains unknown; however, the most likely origin for each of them is a vast triangle stretched from Central Europe in the west through the Russian Plain to the east and to Levant to the south. Haplogroup B is descended from Œ≤-haplogroup (and not from haplogroup A, from which it is very distant, and separated by as much as 123,000 years of ‚Äúlat- eral‚Äù mutational evolution) likely migrated to Africa after 46,000 ybp. The finding that the Europeoid haplogroups did not descend from ‚ÄúAfrican‚Äù haplogroups A or B is supported by the fact that bearers of the Europeoid haplogroups, as well as all non-African haplogroups do not carry either SNPs M91, P97, M31, P82, M23, M114, P262, M32, M59, P289, P291, P102, M13, M171, M118 (haplogroup A and its subclades SNPs) or M60, M181, P90 (haplogroup B), as it was shown recently in ‚ÄúWalk through Y‚Äù FTDNA Project (the reference is incorporated therein) on several hundred people from various haplogroups.

Alot of people on the this forum, and other forums think this is because people tried to get a very cheap RU key, just because they are cheapa*ses. The fact of the matter remains that alot of other people are affected aswell. Not everyone was out to buy a cheap key, alot of people abroad just bought a physical copy to have the dvd-rom on their shelf. Alot of people were unable to buy the game as Blizzard did not supply enough dvds or keys for the EU languages, so people opted to find another key digital. As the price of a physical copy in for example the Netherlands is only ‚Ç¨ 45,95 from a Blizzard controlled retailer, they will not buy the game for ‚Ç¨ 59,99 from the Blizzard store. Pls also note that the physical copy and the digital copy in Brazil, and Mexico for example have the same price , but still people are getting error 8x. Why only because they have the game key of a physical box!!   a guy from Brazil:  [quote]WOW...

As prices were ranging from ‚Ç¨ 30 - ‚Ç¨ 59, they thought to their selfs ""let's buy a cheap key as all keys should be the same"". You would have done the same thing, especialy if you didn't have a lot of money. Alot of people even bought keys for the FULL amount of money as they believed "" If i pay full i will have a good key "" as they are ( or were ) Blizzard fan boys ( like I was ).

Increase the distance each time.""  Basically your ankles and feet need time to strengthen muscles they have never really used because you have padded shoes.   Personally, I don't run in mine, I lift in them (and they also make great water shoes), because they force support muscles to become stronger.  I have a friend who was a marathon runner back when VFFs first came out. He didn't heed the warning and ran twenty miles in them and ended up not being able to walk for over a week. He's kind of a moron.   EDIT: From their website:  &gt;- Listen to your feet! Switching to Vibram FiveFingers¬Æ from traditional shoes is a transition that may take time. For some, it is a matter of weeks, for others months, and for a few it could be a year or more. Much is dependent on your foot type, the activities you‚Äôre using FiveFingers for, and the amount of pronation you experience. The progression will ultimately be worth the wait, and your foot and body will be stronger and better off for it. The answer lies in your inherent foot and body biomechanics and the condition of your muscles. Just remember, improving the skill of those muscles then practicing and using those muscles in Vibram FiveFingers¬Æ will increase both endurance and strength. This will have profound beneficial effects on your body and wellbeing. Listen to your body.  &gt;- Stop if your arches or the top of your foot is hurting, or if anything else hurts! Remember to transition slowly to FiveFingers in order to build strength in your lower legs and feet and to minimize discomfort. An adjustment period is normal, and any discomfort should decrease after a week or two of use. When running in FiveFingers, sometimes arch and foot pain occurs from landing with your feet too far forward relative to your hips and having to point your toes too much. It can also occur from landing with too rigid a foot and not letting your heel drop gently.  &gt;- Stop and let your body heal if you experience pain. Sore, tired muscles are normal; bone, joint, or soft-tissue pain is a signal of injury.  &gt;- In the beginning, remember to carry your traditional footwear in your hands as a backup. If you need to stop in the middle of a workout, you can put on your cushioned running shoes and continue with your activity.",¬Æ

Do you really expect me to believe that promoting a third party candidate here is going to divert even **one** vote away from Mitt Romney? Really? That's rich.  There is a finite number of votes in a general election. In districts where the vote is virtually an even split, then diverting just a few votes from one side or the other is just as effective as getting those votes yourself. This is math we're talking about here.  I'm trying not to be too patronizing here, but if you are sincerely struggling with this concept then allow me to illustrate it for you:  [The Problems with First Past the Post Voting Explained](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7tWHJfhiyo)  I can't find anything more accessible than this, so please forgive the Sesame Street quality.  &gt; Anyhow: Can I ask you why Mitt Romney would be so catastrophically worse than Obama to warrant fighting the election purely on the basis of preventing him from taking office?  Here's a pretty obvious one:  [Romney is a an anti-choice candidate.](http://www.mittromney.com/issues/values)  If you are able to get pregnant, then Mitt Romney's policy will be harmful to you. I don't know how much attention you pay to congress, but the GOP has really raised the roof on passing anti-abortion bills since the mid-term election in 2010. This is a red meat issue where a Republican President could result in very real consequences for women. Even if a ban on abortion isn't made possible by his administration or Supreme Court appointments, you can damn-well bet that defunding Planned Parenthood would have negative effects on the health of women - especially those who are in poverty.  Romney and most Republicans are not shy about their desire to get rid of the FTC, FDA, EPA and any other agency that tries to keep anyone honest. I don't remember Romney applauding the current administration for picking Elizabeth Warren to head a Consumer Protection agency clamp down on the massive amount of fraud in the financial sector. It wasn't Obama that wrote an Op-ed for the NY Times saying ""Let Detroit Go Bankrupt!"".  I'm not going to waste any more time picking apart the distinctions between Republicans and Democrats because if you really don't see any distinction between those two parties then I'm just going to have to assume that you either are not paying much attention or are using some very fuzzy reasoning. Obama didn't come into office with a roaring economy, sound fiscal projections and peace overseas, but that doesn't mean he can ignore the situation. Where was Gary Johnson in 2004? Why didn't he challenge George W. Bush in the Republican Primary? I guess back then he wasn't done growing his liberty‚Ñ¢ glands.  &gt; For that matter, can you name me a single issue on which Barack Obama is further to the left than Mitt Romney, and isn't taking the same position as Gary Johnson?  Is same-sex marriage legal in New Mexico? Obama is the first US President to openly support marriage equality, to allow gays to serve openly in the military, extended federal employee benefits to include same-sex couples, and has [appointed more openly gay officials than any previous US President](http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2010/oct/26/obama-has-appointed-most-us-gay-officials/).  Talk is cheap, what has Gary **accomplished** for the LGBT community?  Don't like how Obama kept Gitmo open?  [Gary Johnson: Keep Guantanamo Open](http://onespot.wsj.com/politics/2011/04/29/d7aa8/gary-johnson-keep-guantanamo-open)  Oh, and about that ""Fair Tax"" nonsense. Imagine the fit Republicans would throw if President Obama suggested a tax plan where the federal government sent everybody a monthly check for $196 and required all individual persons and families to register with the federal government annually and disclose their residence, the number of family members, and their ages. These ""Prebates"" would be cut off immediately for those who fail to do so. Every qualifying family member would have to have a Social Security number. ""Prebates"" would go directly to those over age 18 and to the designated head of family in the case of children under 18.  [That's the Fair Tax.](http://taxprof.typepad.com/taxprof_blog/files/bartlett_fair_tax.pdf)  How's that for ""small government""?

The polls are closing and votes are coming in neck and neck between Romney and Obama. Gary Johnson has only collected roughly 2% of the vote tonight and cannot possibly win in this election. Your district is the last one to report in and early polls indicate that it is ""too close to call"" between Romney and Obama. Your vote can tip the scales either way and Johnson can't win.

t5_2qh2p,Dudesan,1339430677,"I've heard many christians claim that there's a distinction between ""moral, civil, and ceremonial laws"", but not one has ever been able to give me a straight answer about how they tell the difference between the three. It's clearly about what they find personally distasteful or silly, but admitting that that was the case would rather undermine their positions, so don't expect them to admit it. Apart from a few commands which were explicitly intended for a specific people at a specific time, there is absolutely nothing to indicate that most of these laws weren't supposed to be binding for everyone for all time. Indeed, in many places (See Leviticus 23:21, for example), it's explicitly stated that they *are*.  Remember, many Christians find it more comfortable to believe in a god who doesn't condone, command or commit murder, slavery, rape, child abuse, animal abuse, arson, torture, ritual mutilation, fratricide, patricide, matricide, infanticide, genocide, and so on than to believe in one who does. Unfortunately, since the Bible (Old Testamant and New) is pretty clear about Yahweh's position on these things, holding a belief in Loving Hippie Jesus‚Ñ¢ requires ignoring huge portions of it. Or just never reading it in the first place, which seems to be the most popular option.  Well, let's say what Jesus has to say about that:  &gt;‚ÄúDo not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished.  (Matthew 5:17-18, NIV)  Some Christians claim that his death and resurrection ""fulfill"" this. That is bullshit for one simple reason: last time I checked, Heaven and Earth haven't passed away.  Jesus also made his views on people ""picking and choosing"" quite clear:  &gt;[Jesus] answered them, ‚ÄúAnd why do you break God‚Äôs commandment because of your tradition? For God said:    *Honor your father and your mother;* and, *The one who speaks evil of father or mother must be put to death.*  &gt; But you say, ‚ÄòWhoever tells his father or mother, ‚ÄúWhatever benefit you might have received from me is a gift committed to the temple‚Äù‚Äî  he does not have to honor his father.‚Äô In this way, you have revoked God‚Äôs word because of your tradition. Hypocrites! Isaiah prophesied correctly about you when he said:    &gt;These people honor Me with their lips, but their heart is far from Me.  They worship Me in vain, teaching as doctrines the commands of men.‚Äù  (Matthew 15:3-9, NIV)   Looks like Jesus has quite a bit to say about people who ignore commandments, in fact. But maybe it's just Matthew?  &gt;It is easier for heaven and earth to disappear than for the least stroke of a pen to drop out of the Law.  (Luke 16:17, NIV)  Okay, so Jesus is a bust. Let's see what the Epistles have to say about the Mosaic Code:  &gt; If you really keep the royal law found in Scripture, ‚ÄúLove your neighbor as yourself,‚Äù you are doing right.  But if you show favoritism, you sin and are convicted by the law as lawbreakers. For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it.   (James 2:8-10, NIV)  &gt;All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness,  (2 Timothy 3:16)  &gt;Do we, then, nullify the law by this faith? Not at all! Rather, we uphold the law.  (Romans 3:31)  &gt;Know this first of all, that *there is no prophecy of scripture that is a matter of personal interpretation*, for no prophecy ever came through human will; but rather human beings moved by the holy Spirit spoke under the influence of God.""  (2 Peter 20-21 NAB)  Well, shit.   This problem disappears quite quickly if you assert that most of the Bible is hogwash, and you only care about the good parts. If you prefer to cling to it as an inspired document, vague mutterings about ""context"" or about Jesus abolishing the old Law won't get you anywhere.",‚Ñ¢

The first 3 (bought transplants from Home Depot) I had were totally destroyed by green caterpillars.

Without looking up the effective doses of each of those ingredient, my knee jerk reaction is that you won't be getting enough of any of those to make a significant difference at a combined total of 1,500 mg per  serving.    *** Fuck it, I'm intrigued... According to examine.com:  * 750mg is the effective dose for Acetyl-L-carnitine * 3000mg for D-Aspartic acid (I assume it and L-Aspartic acid are just stereoisomers) * 50-200mg for Coenzyme Q10 * 300-600mg for Alpha-GPC * No entry for Phosphatidylcholine  Any way you slice it the minimum dosages of all the combined will be well over 1500mg.  And since it's a propriatary blend you can't know what amount of each is in there.  Most likely the cheaper the ingredient the more of it there is.

The default box model makes you use math though.  left border width + left padding + content width + right padding + right border = total width  &gt;It's already free and easy to use multiple files for organization.

This isn't a given.  &gt;I don't know what cache busting is  `foo.png?&lt;timestamp&gt;`, `foo.&lt;timestamp&gt;.png`, or `foo.&lt;hash&gt;.png`.  In the response headers you tell the UA that the resource won't change for a year. Now, if it actually does change, the timestamp or hash changes, too, which means that the URL is now also different. This works around the cache and the resource is requested anew.  Usually, it's kinda difficult to do this inside CSS files.  (By the way, Drupal also uses cache busting for the merged CSS and JS files.)  &gt;Comments are already free.

t5_2qh6c,joshland,1339531176,"This is a losing-proposition debate with no good end.  You can't win this debate because it's essentially meaningless.  It doesn't prove anything, either way.  If there is a visible source of observable genetic material collecting over time, that would only prove that the certain Evangelical interpretations of the Bible are incorrect.  Basically, the past four-hundred years has a long trail of straw-men setup by clergymen who should have known better.  There is no value.  Evolution is discreetly possible and based upon the current state of the Art, extremely likely as the mechanism of all developed life on Earth.  The people who began this were not trying to answer the question of ""Is there a God?"".  They were answering the question ""How does life change, how did we come about, why are there all these extinct shells in the ground?"".  For a short ""maybe this happened"" version, imagine God, making the Universe, and for whatever reason, as the slow (a meaningless word to Eternity) progress of separation and collections of gasses and supernova result in the creation of matter and point coalesce into Galaxies ,etc, etc, our planet and Solar System come about.  The beginnings of life on Earth.  Planets and Stars are still being made.  Galaxies are still being made.  It stands to reason that life is progressing in a straight line.    There was now this isolated little planet, and Things Happened‚Ñ¢, and when things were at their point, a Garden was made and a Man was made.  He (man) was androgynous, and he was placed in the Garden.  Having named (which is to suggest assigned purpose) to all of creation, he found no peer.  God, in his infinite wisdom, decides that man needs someone with which he can interact with in similar fashion to how he should interact with God.  Ergo, He make a genetic split and the ""He"", which was He/She, are now two - He and She.  Then Adam names Eve, and the world of Humans begins.  After that, shit get's messy.   Suddenly, everything is still the same, but we're not afraid of research anymore, and we don't need to bludgeon perfectly happy scientists with a thrice-interpreted book of which we are utterly convinced OUR READING MUST be the ONLY ONE TRUE reading.    Finally, as to being a Christian with ""no visions"" or ""liver shivers"", I submit that you're completely outside the scope of everyone whose faith you claim to emulate.  From Adam and Eve to the students of the students of the students of the Apostles, they all claimed contact with a Someone - complete with visions, liver shivers, promises of impossible things, fires from heaven, limbs regrown, diseases cured and souls healed. They identified ""HIM"" as the source of their convictions, they found that their sense of guilt agreed with Him, even when their excuses kept coming, but that Contact changed their life.  They claim that this Someone Loves the world, conveyed the power to Heal and to remove the weight of a malignant infection which systematically destroyed the souls of men - Sin.  Furthermore, they even claimed visions which showed them an abominable Spirit whose purpose was the destruction of man, and who had received this power to destroy man from the first ones which he deceived.  None of this can be neatly fit into the pages of a book.  The Book might make a record of men's live and their claims.  But they're about a real as a globe in a school is compared to the Earth.  Full of purpose and reason though the globe may be, it is only useful as a map and learning tool.  I find it highly unlikely that they, the Fathers and Mothers of this Faith, would count arguing over the literal interpretation of the first seconds of life and the Universe as seminal in their experience.  The entire first bit in Genesis is poetic and prophetic in nature.  I don't think that means allegory, but it means that these extremely concrete and demanding interpretations of it are so secondary as to be pointless.  Jesus hardly is recorded as preaching on the origins of life.  Paul certainly never took up origins in any significant way.  In short, Religions vs. Evolution is as much of a False Dichotomy as the entire Free Will vs Predestination debate.  **Note**: Sorry for grammar and typos.  Gotta go.",‚Ñ¢

But it's good because when the polar ice melts, we at Shell can go up there to get more oil, which can do a whole lot of things. Thanks to oil:  Mommy and Daddy can drive to the store to buy you new toys. Companies like Mattel‚Ñ¢ can build new toys. Engineers can drive to work to design new, better toys that are even more fun to play with. When you're done with your toys, trucks can take them away to dispose of.

It's clearly about what they find personally distasteful or silly, but admitting that that was the case would rather undermine their positions, so don't expect them to admit it. Apart from a few commands which were explicitly intended for a specific people at a specific time, there is absolutely nothing to indicate that most of these laws weren't supposed to be binding for everyone for all time. Indeed, in many places (See Leviticus 23:21, for example), it's explicitly stated that they *are*.  Remember, many Christians find it more comfortable to believe in a god who doesn't condone, command or commit murder, slavery, rape, child abuse, animal abuse, arson, torture, ritual mutilation, fratricide, patricide, matricide, infanticide, genocide, and so on than to believe in one who does. Unfortunately, since the Bible (Old Testamant and New) is pretty clear about Yahweh's position on these things, holding a belief in Loving Hippie Jesus‚Ñ¢ requires ignoring huge portions of it. Or just never reading it in the first place, which seems to be the most popular option.  Well, let's say what Jesus has to say about that:  &gt;‚ÄúDo not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished.  (Matthew 5:17-18, NIV)  Some Christians claim that his death and resurrection ""fulfill"" this. That is bullshit for one simple reason: last time I checked, Heaven and Earth haven't passed away.  Jesus also made his views on people ""picking and choosing"" quite clear:  &gt;[Jesus] answered them, ‚ÄúAnd why do you break God‚Äôs commandment because of your tradition? For God said:    *Honor your father and your mother;* and, *The one who speaks evil of father or mother must be put to death.*  &gt; But you say, ‚ÄòWhoever tells his father or mother, ‚ÄúWhatever benefit you might have received from me is a gift committed to the temple‚Äù‚Äî  he does not have to honor his father.‚Äô In this way, you have revoked God‚Äôs word because of your tradition. Hypocrites! Isaiah prophesied correctly about you when he said:    &gt;These people honor Me with their lips, but their heart is far from Me.  They worship Me in vain, teaching as doctrines the commands of men.‚Äù  (Matthew 15:3-9, NIV)   Looks like Jesus has quite a bit to say about people who ignore commandments, in fact. But maybe it's just Matthew?  &gt;It is easier for heaven and earth to disappear than for the least stroke of a pen to drop out of the Law.  (Luke 16:17, NIV)  Okay, so Jesus is a bust. Let's see what the Epistles have to say about the Mosaic Code:  &gt; If you really keep the royal law found in Scripture, ‚ÄúLove your neighbor as yourself,‚Äù you are doing right.  But if you show favoritism, you sin and are convicted by the law as lawbreakers. For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it.   (James 2:8-10, NIV)  &gt;All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness,  (2 Timothy 3:16)  &gt;Do we, then, nullify the law by this faith? Not at all! Rather, we uphold the law.  (Romans 3:31)  &gt;Know this first of all, that *there is no prophecy of scripture that is a matter of personal interpretation*, for no prophecy ever came through human will; but rather human beings moved by the holy Spirit spoke under the influence of God.""  (2 Peter 20-21 NAB)  Well, shit.   This problem disappears quite quickly if you assert that most of the Bible is hogwash, and you only care about the good parts.

(James 2:8-10, NIV)  &gt;All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness,  (2 Timothy 3:16)  &gt;Do we, then, nullify the law by this faith? Not at all! Rather, we uphold the law.  (Romans 3:31)  &gt;Know this first of all, that *there is no prophecy of scripture that is a matter of personal interpretation*, for no prophecy ever came through human will; but rather human beings moved by the holy Spirit spoke under the influence of God.""  (2 Peter 20-21 NAB)  Well, shit.   This problem disappears quite quickly if you assert that most of the Bible is hogwash, and you only care about the good parts. If you prefer to cling to it as an inspired document, vague mutterings about ""context"" or about Jesus abolishing the old Law won't get you anywhere. ",‚Ñ¢

You're merely buying into the whole 'UFC Hype Machine‚Ñ¢', and it has deluded you into believing that there isn't legitimate talent outside of the UFC.  Eddie Alvarez, Gilbert Melendez, Shinya Aoki, Josh Thomson, Michael Chandler, etc... would do just fine in the UFC, and it wouldn't surprise me in the least if one of them ended up with the title.  I used to be a big fan of Bisping, I always thought he was the best guy in the UK, and I was really excited to see him on TUF. He was my pick to win the entire season. However, he has done very little to warrant a title shot and he has been gifted decisions and easy match ups. He has lost to every top fighter he has ever faced in the UFC.  You don't understand why people hate Bisping? That shocks me. Intentional fouls? Gift decisions and claiming they were justified? Spitting at people? Throwing water in DaMarques Johnson face on TUF? Claiming he doesn't care if people dislike him, yet he constantly cries about people disliking him?  He's a good fighter, but an absolutely shitty human being. I hope, for his sake, that it's all just an act to keep his name relevant.

If I had to quantify it, I'd say...200-220lbs over the next 3 years.  **Making a plan** I currently have a membership to the local rec center, where I swim 5-6 days a week for anywhere between 30mins to 2 hours a day, depending on my schedule. I also have added weight training four days a week and am looking at adding the The Couch-to-5K ¬Æ Running Plan once I lose a little more weight. As far as diet goes, I plan to keep my caloric intake between 1200-1500 per day until my workout regiment demands more calories to sustain itself. Also, I receive about $75-100 in free booze and bar food a week. I'm trading in nachos for chicken salads (with just chicken and lettuce) and drinking 8-10 whiskey/vodka/rum/gins plus high calorie mixer for 2 a night with club soda.

t5_2fwo,Roujo,1339611168,"&gt;In my case, you'd have access to both the username and the salt so neither one is really safer than the other.  Let's take two fictional situations about attacking websites.  On one side, we have Alice. Having heard about how password salts are a Good Thing‚Ñ¢, Alice decides to randomly generate a salt, use it to hash her user's passwords and then store all the username, hash and salt in her system's database. On the other side, we have Bob, who decides to use the user's email as a salt instead since it's their username anyway, but has an otherwise identical system - they're lovers, and they go so far as to share their code with each other.  Enter Craig and Dave, hackers twins with evil intent. As a personal challenge (and because Alice decided to go out with Bob rather than Dave), they decide to hack Alice and Bob's systems. Seeing revenge at hand, they get to it.  Craig probes their websites, finds some unpatched vulnerabilities - maybe even a zero-day or two - and being the competent hacker that he is, he gets the databases fairly easily. ""Hmm, they hashed their passwords. Not a problem."" Hoping for the best, he runs the hashes against his Super-Duty Rainbow Table 2000. No dice. ""Damn those meddling programmers, they used a salt!"" Alice's salt is pretty easy to find - the ""pwd_salt"" field is a nice hint -, but Bob's is a bit more complicated. Security by obscurity being what it is, though, Craig ends up (correctly) guessing that the username might have been used instead, checks the code of the website, confirms his hunch and a-crakin' he goes.  Meanwhile, Alice and Bob notice something strange on their access logs. They never would have thought so many people in Thailand would be interested in their local community sites. It's odd, really. Wait...  Shit.  Alarms are sounded, and users are prompted to change their passwords. Alice and Bob proudly state that the password they stored were salted, and the social media is all over how responsible they were. After all, thanks to their quick action, only a few accounts were compromised - Craig probably wished he had bought that √úberGTX HD 6.23e23 to crack those passwords faster, but oh well, he still got enough info to cause some trouble around town.  Back to Dave. Now, although they are technically identical twins, Dave has always been the craftier one. With a little social engineering, he got word from Eve, Bob's still-ruffled ex-girlfriend, that the latter decided to forego generating a salt, and has used email instead. To Craig, this information might have saved him the time he spent wondering what the salt might be. To Dave, though, it's priceless. He boots up his trusty comp, filters through the town's official website and message boards - Government 2.0 - and gathers a nice list of all the town's officials' email adresses. ""I have you now."" He picks a couple of those Important Persons and takes the time to generate a custom rainbow table for common passwords - salted with their known email adresses. Sure, it takes time and space, but patience is a virtue he has and besides, he can look for attack vectors while those hashes are cooking.  *ding*  Having those hot-off-the-GPU tables in hand plus a couple of still unpatched flaws that Craig didn't use or overlooked, Dave gets to it, copies the poor databases to his comp and then...  Unlike his brother Craig, who had to compute the hashes after he had broken in, Dave's method allows him to crack Bob's passwords by simply *comparing them with his rainbow table*, as if no salt had been used at all. This allows him to get a lot more done a lot faster, and by the time Bob's sysadmins realize that they've been hacked again, a lot more passwords have been cracked and more damage has been done.

Meanwhile, Alice's password to the same time to crack, the damage to her system was a lot smaller than to Bob's, and their relationship is now a bit more complicated than before.  **TL;DR**  To sum it up, using the username as a hash allows the hacker to generate hashes beforehand, lessening the work he needs to do once he has his hands on the database and so lessening the window in which the sysadmins can react before damage is done. This implies that the hacker knows that fact beforehand, but that can be found using social engineering or other means.",‚Ñ¢

In 2009, GameTruck had a break out year growing by more than 800% and expanding into most of the top markets across the United States.  So, for starters, GameTruck DIDN'T EVEN EXIST until 2006 and didn't really expand until 2009.  So, most likely, OP is about 3 years into business.  90 trucks and similar franchises just means some franchise creators see a great scam and are doing great with it.  It's a perfect sell to someone with no real job skills that wants a cool and easy-seeming job, it's the exact way they scammed the owner of the Play N Trade I worked for: he was a 25 year old that played lots of video games and had some rich doctor parents to co-sign the loan and give him some start up funds.  Little did he know, video games are an oversaturated industry and between eBay and digital download services, there's no room for anything but GameStop.  The difference here is that this guy is competing with people's own living room.  Why leave my house to pay hundreds of dollars to play games in a trailer when I could invite people over to my house and play on the exact same setup?  Moreover, why not just put on a headset and everyone play in their own environment?  You could argue social interaction, but if you want to be social, should you be renting a fucking game trailer?    For your second part, once again you jump to FOOD, which is not related to this at all.  Food is a necessity.  Premium coffee may not be a complete necessity, but between convenience and the performance boost, one could argue that coffee is fairly necessary to a professional person.  Bottled water was a hit because people were scammed into thinking that tap water was dangerous, plain and simple.  Also, to further prove my point, premium coffee is losing favor to things like Keurig coffee machines and other instant single cup brewers and bottled water is losing out to Britta filters and people just drinking normal tap water.  See, they were FADs, and FADs don't last.  The only people that win in a FAD is the people selling the business before the fad goes away and then the people left owning the fad business are financially screwed.

t5_2sokd,tharealmegaman,1339704117,"Yeah I'm positive mistakes would happen.  I also think that every institution would have their price, but would the person taking the loan want to pay it?  Would the secondary market want to absorb the mistakes of these banks?  Let's imagine a free market and then imagine that Kenerdedy &amp; Co‚Ñ¢ is a responsible bank, during good times and bad, and only sells mortgage products to well qualified people putting down over 20% on their loans.  Let's say it's offering 3.625% on 30 year fixed loans since the buyers are so well qualified.    Let's now imagine that shareholders in Kenerdedy &amp; Co‚Ñ¢ want to ramp up profit margins and offer loans to less qualified buyers that only have 'decent' credit and 10% to put down.  They do the math and agree that 5% of these loans will default, but charging 4.25% interest will cover that risk.  Now Kenerdedy &amp; Co's‚Ñ¢ senior partners are out buying Maseratis and coke and agree that the easy way to fuel this new cash addiction is to take on higher risk clients.  Now they're willing to loan to any schmuck that walks into Kenerdedy &amp; Co's‚Ñ¢ glass and marble doors at their chic midtown branch.  However they're still rational and agree that they would need to charge 7.5% to these people since 30% will default.  However, these deadbeats were lured by ads for 3.625% mortgage rates and don't want to pay 7.5% because it's a difference of $244/mo per every $100k they're borrowing.  They just can't afford it.  Kenerdedy &amp; Co‚Ñ¢ doesn't sell as many of these products as they think but won't be anymore flexible with the rate because their tolerance for risk is still lower.  Let's say that I walk in and get suckered by Kenerdedy &amp; Co's‚Ñ¢ top sales agent and sign up to buy a $500k condo with 5% down and cough up the 7.5% rate.  They give me the loan even though I can't be trusted to give someone correct change for a $20 bill.  Kenerdedy &amp; Co decides they don't want a loan as risky as mine on their books so they try to sell it to BofA because it's widely known that those dumbasses will buy anything.  However this loan is rated so low that even the chimps at BofA raise an eyebrow and can't justify the risk on this juicy 7.5% loan because they still want to stay in business.  However I happen to be a junior level executive at MegaMan &amp; Co‚Ñ¢ in charge of buying mortgage backed securities.  I want to improve my numbers so I take on Kenerdedy &amp; Co's 7.5% loan that turns out to be mine and give them a small fee for it.  I get fired for taking on so much risk, default on my loan like 92384 other loans I bought for MegaMan &amp; Co‚Ñ¢ and I'm on the corner trying to clean Kenerdedy &amp; Co executive's windshields for change alongside all other former employees since they just went bankrupt.  Kenerdedy &amp; Co feels smug about their wise business practices and goes off to buy more Maseratis.  Or maybe I have too much faith in billion dollar businesses.  /coffee",‚Ñ¢

t5_2qh7f,professorpan,1339705838,"I've graduated to a lot more complicated, time-consuming, but rewarding recipes, but here are some college-appropriate recipes from my bachelor frog days. Time and money are approximated for single-servings.  -----  ### 5 Minute Chunky Pasta  Ingredients: $3  1. 250g dry spaghetti  2. Water  3. A can of Chunky Soup  Prep: (8 minutes)  1. Boil water  2.

Mix the two in a water bottle  2. Shake it like a Polaroid‚Ñ¢ picture.   Quick boost of carb and fat. Calcium is good for you.

It's clearly about what they find personally distasteful or silly, but admitting that that was the case would rather undermine their positions, so don't expect them to admit it. Apart from a few commands which were explicitly intended for a specific people at a specific time, there is absolutely nothing to indicate that most of these laws weren't supposed to be binding for everyone for all time. Indeed, in many places (See Leviticus 23:21, for example), it's explicitly stated that they *are*.  Remember, many Christians find it more comfortable to believe in a god who doesn't condone, command or commit murder, slavery, rape, child abuse, animal abuse, arson, torture, ritual mutilation, fratricide, patricide, matricide, infanticide, genocide, and so on than to believe in one who does. Unfortunately, since the Bible (Old Testamant and New) is pretty clear about Yahweh's position on these things, holding a belief in Loving Hippie Jesus‚Ñ¢ requires ignoring huge portions of it. Or just never reading it in the first place, which seems to be the most popular option.  Well, let's say what Jesus has to say about that:  &gt;‚ÄúDo not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.

Jesus also made his views on people ""picking and choosing"" quite clear:  &gt;[Jesus] answered them, ‚ÄúAnd why do you break God‚Äôs commandment because of your tradition? For God said:    *Honor your father and your mother;* and, *The one who speaks evil of father or mother must be put to death.*  &gt; But you say, ‚ÄòWhoever tells his father or mother, ‚ÄúWhatever benefit you might have received from me is a gift committed to the temple‚Äù‚Äî  he does not have to honor his father.‚Äô In this way, you have revoked God‚Äôs word because of your tradition. Hypocrites! Isaiah prophesied correctly about you when he said:    &gt;These people honor Me with their lips, but their heart is far from Me.  They worship Me in vain, teaching as doctrines the commands of men.‚Äù  (Matthew 15:3-9, NIV)   Looks like Jesus has quite a bit to say about people who ignore commandments, in fact. But maybe it's just Matthew?  &gt;It is easier for heaven and earth to disappear than for the least stroke of a pen to drop out of the Law.  (Luke 16:17, NIV)  Okay, so Jesus is a bust. Let's see what the Epistles have to say about the Mosaic Code:  &gt; If you really keep the royal law found in Scripture, ‚ÄúLove your neighbor as yourself,‚Äù you are doing right.  But if you show favoritism, you sin and are convicted by the law as lawbreakers. For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it.   (James 2:8-10, NIV)  &gt;All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness,  (2 Timothy 3:16)  &gt;Do we, then, nullify the law by this faith?

No biggie, right? At least I was prepared.  Over the course of the afternoon, I had to add some plasters to other toes where the skin was starting to get raw.  Late afternoon, my feet had swollen from the heat and my walking had gotten significantly slower and more painful. I took them off and walked barefoot, where I thought I could get away with it.  End of the evening, I had trouble walking. I was limping, resting most of my weight on my boyfriend.

t5_2qm4e,faul_sname,1339724943,"&gt;How is information = energy? You brought it up, so I'm curious now.  Ok, now we'll get into Maxwell's demon.  Return to the horrible ascii art, but now let's put a demon who only lets particles go left in the middle.       /‚Äæ‚Äæ‚Äæ‚Äæ‚Äæ\   /‚Äæ‚Äæ‚Äæ‚Äæ‚Äæ\     |  o o  -‚ôÄ-      |     |       -&lt;-  o o  |  6 states      \_____/   \_____/       /‚Äæ‚Äæ‚Äæ‚Äæ‚Äæ\   /‚Äæ‚Äæ‚Äæ‚Äæ‚Äæ\     |  o o  -‚ôÄ-      |     |  o    -&lt;-    o  | 4 states      \_____/   \_____/       /‚Äæ‚Äæ‚Äæ‚Äæ‚Äæ\   /‚Äæ‚Äæ‚Äæ‚Äæ‚Äæ\     |  o o  -‚ôÄ-      |     |  o o  -&lt;-       | 1 state      \_____/   \_____/  So the demon just moved it to a lower-entropy state by blocking particles from going right (which doesn't take energy) and allowing particles to go left (which also doesn't take energy). Then we can extract energy from this system by allowing the particles to expand back into the space on the right (more particles on the left means a pressure differential). So unless information costs energy, you could get infinite energy out of any system.   As it turns out, information/ reduced entropy does cost energy, specifically according to this equation:      E = kT ln(n)  where n is the number of states you eliminate as possibilities.",‚ôÄ

Well, I was sitting on one of the inflatable pool chair-raft thingies feeling pretty fucking awesome that I got up there by myself when the guy comes and playfully flips me off of it.  I didn't really know how to swim at that point so I sunk like a rock and took in a lot of water on the way down.  I can only remember tiny bits and pieces of what happened next.

I used to have this subreddit bookmarked by comments and usually about half the new comments were from EPS regulars or other people who aren't really interested in talking about Ron Paul's policies and are just here to stir things up. It's the same people all the time too. Many have like 20,000+ karma. It's like dealing with spam and it's almost to the point of not being worthwhile.   Obviously they have control of the comments here too because I see the same people getting upvotes as the people that are Ron Paul supporters that are here to talk and/or read about policies and strategies get downvotes. Typical day at /r/ronpaul.  I do think though that other than the distractions the subreddit itself has a lot of positive things going on. I see people that are really educated about what is going on in this country and people that care enough to be involved in some way to improve things. I know that there is a lot of disagreement going on with the Rand, Ron, Gary thing, but I hope that individuals do not get too caught up in all of this because **those are just people and our messages are greater than any single one of them.**  No matter where any of us stand as far as which politician we favor, I think all the liberty-minded individuals here have a great deal to contribute to the world and need to be heard.

t5_2sokd,tharealmegaman,1339773951,"Simply put, it's an investment scheme that pays investors with other investors' money.  Here's how a traditional fund works:  Investors open accounts and deposit money into The Starky Fund‚Ñ¢.  TSF‚Ñ¢ has a defined goal and method of giving its investors return on investment.  Lets say TSF‚Ñ¢ buys broad market stocks and offers their investors modest but low risk returns on average of 3% per year.  (This means a deposit of $10,000 would grow to $10,300 in a year.)  The fund is earning money from the appreciation and dividends of the stocks it owns.  Since stocks are 'liquid,' meaning that they can be bought and sold for cash easily, you can always exit the fund with cash.    In contrast, here's how a variation of a Ponzi scheme works:  Investors open an account and deposit money with The Ponzi Fund‚Ñ¢.  TPF‚Ñ¢ either doesn't define how it makes money or it gives you a really good story about it.  TPF‚Ñ¢ promises outrageous returns like 20% per year.  (A deposit of $10,000 would grow to $12,000 in a year.)  However they're only creating this illusion that they're making successful investments.    For example, me and three friends invest $10,000 each, lured by the sexy 20% return.  You invest $10,000 afterwards.  Your $10,000 is split up to pay us each our $2000 each plus maybe $2000 for the fund manager.  The manager is relying on the next sucker to invest $10,000 so he can pay you out your 20%.  There's no real investment or liquidity taking place; the fund is just paying people with other people's money.  This only works as long as you are able to attract new investors.  This will be easy at first since I'll be at the bar bragging to all my friends about how the investment fund I just signed up with got me a 20% return.  However in order to pay out the 20 new people who signed up, they'll need 30 new people.  This number grows exponentially until the fund can't attract enough new investors to pay people the return they promised.  Then it collapses.  That leaves people who didn't exit early enough penniless.  Since the fund is broke, they can't even sue for their (uninsured) money back.  Edit: A word.",‚Ñ¢

The group's ethos or ideology may also stress common ancestry, religion, or race.*   Note that in this context 'stressing something' doesn't mean that it has to be so, it just means that it's what people find important about it.

Laminine‚Ñ¢ is the complete synergy of:  ‚Ä¢ 22 amino acids ‚Ä¢ Trace minerals ‚Ä¢ Vitamins ‚Ä¢ Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF)  Laminine contains a patented bio-rich extract from fertilized eggs that acts as a powerful ""adaptogen"". To this base ingredient additional amino acids from plant and marine sources are added to create a complete amino acid profile. The proprietary formula contains 22 amino acids, trace minerals and vitamins. It is also the only known food source of Fibroblast Growth Factor-2 (abundant before birth) which is thought to mobilize and instruct the body's stem cells to do their repair work. It is believed that these instructions allow the body to determine when a structure needs to be repaired or if needed destroyed. What is Fibroblast Growth Factor-2? (and Why is it Important?)  Fibroblast Growth Factor-2 is a substance that is abundant in the developing embryo. It is believed to act like an architect directing the growth and development of the new life. Under the direction of FGF-2, the blue print of life is followed precisely making sure that all of the parts are perfectly made and placed. It also nourishes the stem cells that carry on this vital work. Without FGF-2, the body's structure can be compromised. And, unfortunately, this substance is missing from the adult human body. In medicine, synthesized Fibroblast Growth Factor-2 is used routinely. However, Laminine is the ONLY known source of this precious substance in a natural food source.  What are the benefits of Laminine? Improve Neuron Function in the Brain ‚Ä¢ Increase Amino Acids and Peptides in the Cells Assign Proper Stem Cells for Repair  11 Double Blind Clinical Studies have documented the positive results that Laminine can have on overall health  Regular use of Laminine may help to: ‚Ä¢Elevate Mood (increases seratonin levels) ‚Ä¢Decrease Stress (lowers cortisol levels) ‚Ä¢Enhance Memory ‚Ä¢Enhance Brain Function and activity ‚Ä¢Increase Focus and Alertness ‚Ä¢Stimulate natural DHEA to reduce Physical Stress ‚Ä¢Increase Physical, Mental &amp; Emotional strength ‚Ä¢Improve Stamina and Energy ‚Ä¢Better Sleep ‚Ä¢Quicker Recovery after work out ‚Ä¢increase Muscle Tone ‚Ä¢Down-regulate Pain receptors in the body ‚Ä¢Increase Libido ‚Ä¢Reduce Signs of Aging ‚Ä¢Develop a Better Overall Sense of Well-being  How do I take Laminine?

If you know of anyone who has Myathenia Gravis, this product will replace the glutamine and glycine that is deficient in this disease process as it will create the communication at the synapes. AND, of course so many neuro problems, etc. It is unreal. This is a product that I wish I had had for a hundred years.  Children and adults with ADHD, ADD, etc. strokes, Dr. Shelva  SUGGESTED PROTOCOL  2 capsules in the morning and 2 capsules in the mid to late afternoon for two weeks. 1 capsule in the morning and 1 capsule in the afternoon for two weeks. If you feel that you are at optimum health and are ready for maintenance, take 1 capsule daily in the morning. If you are not ready for maintenance, you body will tell you whether you should stay on 4 a day or 2 a day. You can muscle test or have someone muscle test you (applied kinesiology).  *Most important is that you drink a lot of water all day because you will probably detox. (8 to 10 glasses or more)* *Please follow package directions.*  And that's it, folks! I just had a man call whose wife had her first Laminine yesterday and ... no reactions!

t5_2qp5l,tinybluedot,1339816310,"A warm welcome to you, Mr. Throwaway. I get the feeling we'll be seeing more of you. I enjoy your reasoning. so far it's been spot-on.  I too was a M.S. of long standing. It wasn't WTBS organisational policies per se that caused me to eventually leave (after 30 years, I'm 51), rather it was an examination of both the stories in the Bible (creation, flood, Babel, etc.), and the JW's interpretation thereof. First, I reasoned that if The Truth‚Ñ¢ was actually true, it should be able to stand up to any scrutiny- so there could be nothing wrong with me examining the veracity of their claims by reading material with opposing views, in spite of what the WTBS said. This was a big step, I clearly remember my heart pounding when looking at, say, [this page](http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/faq-noahs-ark.html) about the flood. The same with beginning reading ['Why Evolution Is True'](http://jerrycoyne.uchicago.edu/index.html), by Jerry Coyne (1). IMHO, everyone questioning their JW beliefs should start right at the basics of whether there is any reason at all to consider the bible as a document from god, and the Genesis claims are as good a place to start as any. If they're dead wrong, you needn't go any further; if the bible writers don't know where we came from, how can they tell us where we're going? Secondly, examine WT teachings in the light of proper science by learning what the scientists are actually saying themselves, rather than the WT's cherry-picked and heavily biased quotations. I had considered that by reading the JW publications, I had read widely. Reading the society's quotes *in context* was shocking, to say the least. I was horrified to find that they were either ignorant, or deliberately and maliciously misquoting their sources. Either way, it just wasn't acceptable. You think you know science? Read science and be amazed (2).  There are some here who would advise you to leave the JWs and continue on as a christian. In my view, this is merely exchanging one superstition for another- both are ultimately limiting to your personal growth. Worthy of consideration is the thought that perhaps the problems with JW policy and doctrine are not just because the leadership is comprised of imperfect men‚Ñ¢, but are because the foundation document is fundamentally flawed. If that is the case, then any group or individual using it as a life-guide is going to run into problems somewhere along the line- including you.  Leaving the JWs- or any high-control group- is a terrifying experience for many; it certainly was for me. Suddenly, there is a plethora of moral issues demanding your attention. When is war justified? Is abortion ever justified? The questions go on, and YOU get to decide what you think about every one of them. Terrifying, but ultimately exhilarating. Finally, you get to exercise your native intelligence, rather than being scolded for daring to do so. Welcome to freedom, brother- great to have you. Enjoy the ride.   tl;dr: Don't exchange crap for other crap that doesn't smell quite as bad. It's still crap.  1. Another great one is 'The Greatest Show On Earth, by Richard Dawkins, which I approached with some trepidation. To my surprise, his writing was very good; I had been put off by his interviews, he can come over as intolerant. Turns out he's understandably intolerant of ignorance, he sees it as the greatest danger to human survival, &amp; he's probably right.  2. With believing JW family in the home, I had to be circumspect about my reading. I found the best way to do this was to obtain electronic copies of them and read them on my 'phone in the porcelain reading room :) Good times!",‚Ñ¢

t5_2qh2p,Dudesan,1339868254,"Remember, many Christians find it more comfortable to believe in a god who doesn't condone, command or commit murder, slavery, rape, child abuse, animal abuse, arson, torture, ritual mutilation, fratricide, patricide, matricide, infanticide, genocide, and so on than to believe in one who does. Unfortunately, since the Bible (Old Testamant and New) is pretty clear about Yahweh's position on these things, holding a belief in Loving Hippie Jesus‚Ñ¢ requires ignoring huge portions of it. Or just never reading it in the first place, which seems to be the most popular option.  Well, let's say what Jesus has to say about that:  &gt;‚ÄúDo not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished.  (Matthew 5:17-18, NIV)  Some Christians claim that his death and resurrection ""fulfill"" this. That is bullshit for one simple reason: last time I checked, Heaven and Earth haven't passed away.  Jesus also made his views on people ""picking and choosing"" quite clear:  &gt;[Jesus] answered them, ‚ÄúAnd why do you break God‚Äôs commandment because of your tradition? For God said:    *Honor your father and your mother;* and, *The one who speaks evil of father or mother must be put to death.*  &gt; But you say, ‚ÄòWhoever tells his father or mother, ‚ÄúWhatever benefit you might have received from me is a gift committed to the temple‚Äù‚Äî  he does not have to honor his father.‚Äô In this way, you have revoked God‚Äôs word because of your tradition. Hypocrites! Isaiah prophesied correctly about you when he said:    &gt;These people honor Me with their lips, but their heart is far from Me.  They worship Me in vain, teaching as doctrines the commands of men.‚Äù  (Matthew 15:3-9, NIV)   Looks like Jesus has quite a bit to say about people who ignore commandments, in fact. But maybe it's just Matthew?  &gt;It is easier for heaven and earth to disappear than for the least stroke of a pen to drop out of the Law.  (Luke 16:17, NIV)  Okay, so Jesus is a bust. Let's see what the Epistles have to say about the Mosaic Code:  &gt; If you really keep the royal law found in Scripture, ‚ÄúLove your neighbor as yourself,‚Äù you are doing right.  But if you show favoritism, you sin and are convicted by the law as lawbreakers. For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it.   (James 2:8-10, NIV)  &gt;All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness,  (2 Timothy 3:16)  &gt;Do we, then, nullify the law by this faith? Not at all! Rather, we uphold the law.  (Romans 3:31)  &gt;Know this first of all, that *there is no prophecy of scripture that is a matter of personal interpretation*, for no prophecy ever came through human will; but rather human beings moved by the holy Spirit spoke under the influence of God.""  (2 Peter 1:20-21 NAB)  Well, shit.   This problem disappears quite quickly if you assert that most of the Bible is hogwash, and you only care about the good parts. If you prefer to cling to it as an inspired document, vague mutterings about ""context"" or about Jesus abolishing the old Law won't get you anywhere.",‚Ñ¢

t5_2ua25,turkeypants,1339875200,"Since the various guides are a lot to read, here is a sort of general tldr. (warning, I only played this on the PS1 so there could be some differences).  The more cities you have, the more production you can have. If you want to build an army, for example, you need to build fighting units. A city can only build one thing at a time. If you have 1 city, that will take a while. If you have 10 cities, you can get there in no time. And since cities need to be building different things, such as improvements, wonders, engineers/settlers, and other useful noncombat units, having more cities allows some of them to build military units while others work on other important stuff. So I (used to, back when I played) always expand as quickly as possible. This also stakes out your territory to keep other neighboring civilizations from getting that land. You'll want it later and you won't want to have to fight for it. You do have to strike a balance though. You want a city to get a little momentum and get established before you build and send out a settler, because that lowers your population by 1 and you have to build it back up.  What I always used to to was establish my first city and send out the one initial unit exploring around the area to see what other good city spots there would be. A good city spot usually although not always has access to water. Rivers are awesome though if you can build on one. A good spot has lots of plains and grasslands for growing food that will sustain your future large population, and it has some hills and mountains for producing resources you'll need. Maybe some trees to slow down advancing enemy units (higher movement cost). Ocean access is great so you can build ships later and because you can fish and later have platforms out there generating resources. But it also puts you at risk of attacks from ships in the future. It's still usually worth it. Also if a spot has some special items such as pheasants or silk or gold or whatever, you'll reap extra food or resources. This can be a huge advantage early on. Also if you can locate a city at a choke point in the land, it can help you keep other civilizations out of your area (as long as you're not at war). That'll make life easier for your protected cities so they can be about the business of building useful stuff instead of defending against attacks.  Ideally your cities would be close enough that the borders of their surrounding squares just touched the borders of the next one and so on. That would be the most efficient use of space and help with moving units between them quickly when, say, an enemy attacks. But the land does not usually cooperate in that way. If you start a city in an area with unfavorable land, like too much mountain or desert or jungle, you'll have to spend way too much time converting that land to usable land types and it'll keep the city stunted. If you just want it to be kind of an outpost city in a key area, that's fine. Not every city has to be a flourishing city. It can just be effectively a walled base for troops from other cities, a rallying point, a blocker city, a spy nest, etc. But in general you want a city to be able to support itself well and be well balanced.  If cities' squares overlap, then only one of those cities can use a given square and it's useless to the other. So you don't want to overlap in general, but sometimes a spot is too good to pass up and you do it despite a little overlap. You'll survive. Sometimes you'll find a city on accident when you go into a goodie hut. So now you've got a city in a not very good area. You can either make do, convert the land, disband the city, or do what I sometimes do and turn it into a Settler Engine‚Ñ¢ (my term). This is a city whose only job is to pump out Settler units so your other cities don't have to spend their time and resources doing that. This way they get to grow and produce quickly without spending time building settlers, while the Engine spits out settler after settler to go found new cities. If a city builds too many settlers for the level of food and resources it has, it won't be able to support them all and will automatically disband one. That's a waste. So you just keep your eye on those resource levels and meanwhile make your newly minted Settler units go found new cities as quickly as possible so that they are no longer a resource drain on the Engine city. Long story short, it's OK to have a city that's not ideally placed or is even on the grounds of another city so long as it has another job, such as being an outpost or blocker or if its only job is to pump out Settlers/Engineers. It can also build military units as long as you eventually reassign them to be supported from another city. You can disband the city later or just stunt its growth.   You want to strike a balance between expanding as quickly as possible and building up a little substance in your cities with the things and units they need. You want to strike a balance between placing your cities as close together as possible and making sure you're out there in the hinterlands blocking other civs from getting good land or controlling choke points. If your second city is really far away from your first, it is basically on its own in the early parts of the game, because you won't be able to get units from the first city there quickly enough to help it if attacked. Often this is not a problem because everybody is weak in the early stages, but just be aware of the value of proximity. If you hustle, you can really go out and stake out a good territory and then scramble to build cities between those outposts and the capital so you eventually have a good network of cities in close proximity.  Goodie Huts are out there to be had and they often have good stuff in them, whether money or civ advances or a skilled mercenary unit or even a city already founded. They can also have barbarians, which sucks, or nothing, which sucks, but in general it's a good idea to send your first few units out early and try to harvest any of them around you as they get the lay of the land. Try to have a few guys fanning out in different directions from the capital to see what's out there. Build a cheap warrior unit to fortify in your early cities, just enough to keep any wandering units from other civs from just walking right in and taking it (Nobody's strong enough early on to attack a city for the most part, but a little later you'll want to add more defensive units in your cities). But send your other guys out initially. They'll meet units from other civs and figure out who else exists in the world and where, but don't sign any agreements with them early on. If they're so eager to offer, it means they're small and weak and want allies. You may have to crush them later and it'll be easier if you don't have to break a treaty to do it since that will damage your reputation. Everybody will eventually fuck you anyway so don't sign anything unless you have to. Sometimes it's good for improving their assessment of you, which can make them more amenable to trading civ advances with you, but sometimes it's not necessary.  Improving each square of land in a city is good. If it's grassland or plains or river, irrigate it so you grow more food. If it's hills or mountain, mine it so you get more resources. If it's a low-value square like desert or tundra or jungle, transform it into something more useful (but do this only after you've improved the better squares because that's faster). Put roads on any squares you're using to increase the amount of trade. Put railroads (later in the game) on anything producing resources so it will produce more. You want to maximize food, trade, and resource shields to support your stomach, wallet, and production needs, and improving the land is the way to do that.  In terms of civ advances, which I guess is what you mean by skills, this will take experience. Each allows you to do a new thing or paves a path to something else you want. Some things such as Philosophy are good to get to first because the first civ to get them gets a goodie of some kind. Others allow you to build a wonder that will give you an advantage over your opponents. Others allow a new kind of military unit to be built. You may find after a while that you want to make sure you get gunpowder first, so you make your choices based on that path through the flowchart. Or maybe you want to guarantee that you get Leonardo's Workshop, so you focus on the advances that will lead you to that.  As you explore the map, stake out territory, improve city squares, research advances, build things in your cities, and establish relationships, you'll be playing the complex balancing game of keeping your people happy, fed, and productive. Be sure not to neglect trade arrows - that's easy to do when you're first starting and teaching yourself the game. You want as much as possible. Fiddle with your tax, luxury, and science rates too so you're keeping people happy while getting as much revenue as possible while making scientific advances as quickly as possible. Also be sure you understand the ongoing per-turn costs of each kind of unit under the different kinds of government. Units require support, and if a city doesn't have enough food/resources to support them, it will disband them. You can't just make as many units as you want. And if you have too many units costing you resources, you can retard your ability to build as quickly as you otherwise would.  Don't ever start this game. Don't do it. I'm warning you.",‚Ñ¢

Association between regional differences in muscle activation in one session of resistance exercise and in muscle hypertrophy after resistance training. European Journal of Applied Physiology, Online First‚Ñ¢, 20 August 2011""**  Abstract The purpose of this study was to examine if the regional difference in muscle hypertrophy after chronic resistance training is associated with muscle activation after one session of resistance exercise. Twelve men performed one session of resistance exercise of elbow extensors. Before and immediately after the exercise, transverse relaxation time (T2)-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images of upper arm were recorded to evaluate the muscle activation along its length. In the MR images, T2 for the pixels within the triceps brachii muscle was quantified. The number of pixels with T2 greater than the threshold (mean + 1SD of T2 before the exercise) was expressed as the ratio to the number of pixels occupied by the muscle (%activated area). Another 12 subjects completed 12 weeks of training intervention (3 days per week), which consisted of the same program variables as used in the experiment for the T2 measurement. The cross-sectional areas of the triceps brachii before and after the training intervention were measured from MR images of upper arm. The %activated area of the triceps brachii induced by one session of the exercise was found to be significantly lower in the distal region than the middle and proximal regions. Similarly, the relative increase in muscle cross-sectional area after the 12 weeks of training intervention was significantly less in the distal region than the middle and proximal regions. The results suggest that the regional difference in muscle hypertrophy after chronic resistance training is attributable to the regional difference in muscle activation during the exercise.    **Antonio, Jose (2000). Nonuniform Response of Skeletal Muscle to Heavy Resistance Training: Can Bodybuilders Induce Regional Muscle Hypertrophy? The Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research: Vol. 14, No. 1, pp. 102‚Äì113.**   Abstract  Skeletal muscle is a heterogeneous tissue that exhibits numerous inter-and intramuscular differences (i.e., architecture, fiber composition, and muscle function). An individual muscle cannot be simplistically described as a compilation of muscle fibers that span from origin to insertion. In fact, there are unique differences within a single muscle and within single muscle fibers with respect to fiber size and protein composition. Electromyographic data indicate that there is selective recruitment of different regions of a muscle that can be altered, depending on the type of exercise performed. Longitudinal resistance-training studies also demonstrate that individual muscles as well as groups of synergist muscles adapt in a regional-specific manner. The author speculates that no single exercise can maximize the hypertrophic response of all regions of a particular muscle. Thus, for maximal hypertrophy of an entire muscle, athletes (particularly bodybuilders) are justified in incorporating various exercises that purportedly stimulate growth in a regional-specific manner.

Why do you expect them to devote all of their resources to everything? In case you can't figure it out by yourself, it's impossible to have everyone work on everything. Different people work on different things, when everyone is working on something different projects get postponed.   To counter your ridiculous argument, Microsoft hasn't release halo for the PS3 because it's a major franchise that helped get the xbox a major advantage over the playstation. Because of the halo exclusivity on release (even before the 360) a lot of people bought the console for this game. In the long run, it helped push their console, which they are now turning into a media center. It's quite convenient that tens of millions of households have your console are are possibly paying a monthly subscription for it. The monetary gains of releasing halo on different consoles is so little compared to selling millions and millions of consoles after getting the initial sales which spread popularity. You do not understand how small and insignificant profits are on game sales. If microsoft released the best selling game in the world (think even more sales than any call of duty) the profit would be... A few billion? Activision has made a billion on each release. The profits are a fraction of what they're now getting due to the popularity of the console. They're also one-time profits. Once the hype for the game is over, the money-tap stops, while some (read: a lot) xbox users continue to pay a monthly subscription.  You need to accept that microsoft is run by people that are smarter than you. They know how to make business decisions, you don't. Stop acting like you know better than the smartest business analysts in the world. ",‚Ñ¢

t5_2r9po,Aethersong,1339935806,"Here is a quote from the Guild Wars 2 FAQ  &gt; Guild Wars 2 will have the kind of extensive character advancement appropriate to a persistent-world RPG. Our goal is to avoid forcing players into the grind-based gameplay that too often accompanies a high level cap.  &gt; Also, to allow players the freedom to play together even if their friends are at a much higher (or lower) level, we are planning to implement a strong sidekick system, similar to that used in City of Heroes‚Ñ¢.  &gt; We're applying this same philosophy to competitive play. Players will be able to engage in organized, balanced PvP (similar to GvG in the original Guild Wars) without first leveling up characters, finding equipment, and unlocking skills. While inside the organized PvP area, all characters will be the same power level and will have access to the same equipment.  Basically, how Guild Wars 2 will work is that even if you are level one, you can go do organized PvP with no disadvantage because you will get bumped up to max level and given max gear. Furthermore, even if you do reach level 80 in the PvE part of the game, max stat gear will be easy to find. In this regard, Guild Wars 2 is similar to the first game in the series.   Even if one becomes level 80 and gets max stat weapons and armor, this does not mean one runs out of things to do. One can still participate in dungeons and events in order to obtain rare skins. Furthermore, do to the down-leveling system, one can return to even starter areas as a level 80 and still experience a challenge and play with low level friends.   Thus, while most MMORPGs limit you to only to end-game content once you reach max level, Guild Wars 2 enables to the ability to go back and enjoy all parts of the game.",‚Ñ¢

The coconut is hard and has a certain amount of energy based on its mass...but it isn't *that* hard.  I'd imagine that it would probably shatter on impact at 125 m/s.

Unfortunately(?), unless you've got some kind of Super Coconut‚Ñ¢, I don't know if it would survive just traveling through the air at the speed necessary to punch through a human. And if you were performing this in a vacuum to avoid destroying the coconut during its travel and also giving the coconut a constant acceleration such that it wouldn't disintegrate on launch, the speed would probably cause it to explode on impact and it would less penetrate the body than blast it apart (not necessarily bisecting the body, just leaving a massive crater that happens to go all the way through).  ---  I think the main issue here is whether OP wants the coconut to punch clean through and leave a coconut-sized hole in the torso (and possibly be able to retrieve the surviving coconut) or just the impact analysis of a coconut with sufficient energy to leave a ""hole"" of sorts in a human body.

There was also a sniper team and another squad or two that would stay back and provide suppressing fire while we run from the entire enemy force.  The leader of my squad was having connection issues and didn't alt-tab safely (causing him to fire his weapon on tabbing in). This caused a few tense moments when we thought we were spotted. But we managed to make our way to the enemy's camp without being detected.  When we got there we were supposed to look out for incoming enemy patrols, but the other squad couldn't see their target very well, so they asked us to take a look, there was some exchange of information between my squad and the other and then we were just waiting on them to start their attack.  And then my squad leader had connection troubles, so I asked the other squad to delay their attack until his connection got sorted out, he unsafely alt-tabbed, causing him to fire his weapon, unlike the other times the enemy really took notice of this, within a few seconds he was shot to death and I was hit, with their cover blown the other squad continued with their task and I made my way back to the rest of my squad.  Upon meeting up with the remaining other two guys in my squad, I started healing myself while we discussed what to do next, since our planned escape route was swarming with the enemy, we decided to follow along the coast since the enemy's attention was likely driven inward to where the other squad was going.  Shortly after setting off I got shot again and passed out, one of my squadmates commented that I died and I told him that I wasn't dead yet, they decided to leave me behind.  Luckily I wasn't out for long and I managed to make my way to cover to patch myself up, the rest of my squad wasn't far ahead, they saw me and waited for me to catch up. We moved along the coastline, we didn't stop, we saw heaps of tracer fire inland, which made me appreciate the coastline decision.  We managed to get in contact with the littlebird that was responsible for our squad's departure to come and pick us up at the coast (instead of inland, where we were supposed to go) thanks to the sniper team (there was a hill between us the littlebird, which the sniper team was on).  After awhile of continuing to move along the coast, we spotted our littlebird and dropped smoke grenades to get its attention, it came down and picked us up and flew off. My most memorable moment was looking at the land behind us and seeing all the fire, smoke and tracer fire behind us, knowing that I was right next to the event that started it all.  *""BATTLEFIELD‚Ñ¢ MOMENTS""* CAN SUCK IT!",‚Ñ¢

t5_2qm4e,SkepticalRaptor,1340039996,"Most of the answers provided to you are based upon unreliable sources without backing. I'll stick with peer-reviewed studies that should help you.  Before we start, please realize that this is not a theory, but a hypothesis. In the list of scientific principles, the top is a scientific theory, next a scientific law, followed by a scientific hypothesis. At this point in time, there is some evidence and conjecture for ER (endurance running) as an adaptive feature that drove evolution, but little consensus or scientific evidence. For it to be a theory would require consensus based upon so much evidence that it can be predictive.  Furthermore, evolution is driven by natural selection or genetic drift only (though there are some hypotheses about other mechanisms). Before we accept your statement, you need to back up and figure out why an adaption for endurance running would be naturally selected by environmental factors. ER requires physiological changes, which would be selected for in evolution, if your hypothesis were correct.  But I could propose other reasons to select for bipedalism, hairlessness, and intelligence. Bipedalism may have resulted in the move from jungle to savannah, specifically as the climate changed. Hairlessness as a result of warmer temperatures. I could ""hypothesize"" a lot. And don't fall for the meme that there is One Truth‚Ñ¢ for human evolution. You are completely right, there were probably thousands of advantageous adaptations that allowed any of us to survive as a species. Just because ER may have lead to larger brain capacity, it doesn't mean that further advantages selected for even larger capacity.  Finally, many people cannot (or will not?) do ER because most phenotypes in humans have a range from one extreme to another. It's one of those cool things in evolution that genetic variation is a necessary requirement to allow organisms to fill new niches or respond to environmental changes.  Here are some peer-reviewed REAL research for you to read:  1.  [Calcaneus length determines running economy: implications for endurance running performance in modern humans and Neandertals.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21269660)  2. [Locomotor anatomy and biomechanics of the Dmanisi hominins.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20447679) 3. [Walking, running and the evolution of short toes in humans.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19218523) 4. [Limb length and locomotor biomechanics in the genus Homo: an experimental study.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17568443) 5. [Acquisition of bipedalism: the Miocene hominoid record and modern analogues for bipedal protohominids.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15198702) 6. [Endurance running and the evolution of Homo.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15549097)  Now that may seem to be a lot of good research supporting it, but the problem there is some evidence that disputes it. In fact, the last study started a long line of back and forth letter writing in the Journal Nature.  As for the aquatic ape ""hypothesis"", that never became a part of human evolution research. It is a pseudoscience, that pretends to be a science, but there was no evidence. The ER evolution hypothesis is much stronger.  But, please don't conflate theory and hypothesis in science. A theory is the top of science. A hypothesis is at the beginning (and should not be disparaged, you need a hypothesis to ""evolve"" into a theory).  I hope this helps, and apologize for it being TLDR.  And get back to jogging. (I prefer cycling.)",‚Ñ¢

She does seems to fit the category of the use of the device in the commercial setting. Since NovoTTF 100A is now approved by the FDA, she may meet the criteria. Information follows.""              NovoTTF-100ATM¬†System is a portable, non-invasive medical device designed for continuous use throughout the day by the patient. The device has been shown in in vitro and in vivo studies to slow and reverse tumor growth by inhibiting mitosis, the process by which cells divide and replicate. The NovoTTF-100A device, which weighs about six pounds (three kilograms), creates a low intensity, alternating electric field within the tumor that exerts physical forces on electrically charged cellular components, preventing the normal mitotic process and causing cancer cell death prior to division. In patients with recurrent glioblastoma brain tumors, the device has shown clinical efficacy comparable to that of active chemotherapies with better quality of life without many of the side effects of chemotherapy. The most commonly reported side effect from NovoTTF treatment was a mild-to-moderate rash beneath the electrodes. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the NovoTTF-100A System for use as a treatment for adult patients (22 years of age or older) with histologically-confirmed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), following histologically ‚Äì or radiologically-confirmed recurrence in the supra-tentorial region of the brain after receiving chemotherapy. The device is intended to be used as monotherapy, and is intended as an alternative to standard medical therapy for GBM after surgical and radiation options have been exhausted. Patients should only use the NovoTTF-100A System under the supervision of a physician¬†properly trained in use of the device. The NovoTTF‚Ñ¢ device, approved by the Food and Drug Administration in April 2011, is available for prescription use in the U.S. initially throughseveral noted brain cancer research centers whose staff have completed training in the use of this unique device.

Place the stoneware into the heating base, add your ingredients to the stoneware, and cover with the lid.  2. Plug in your Smart-Pot¬Æ slow cooker. The POWER light flashes indicating that the unit is plugged in, but not turned on.  3. Press the COOK TIME button to select a programmed time and temperature. Cook time options include 4 or 6 hours on HIGH, or 8 or 10 hours on LOW.   The corresponding light illuminates, the slow cooker heats, and the internal timer starts counting down the time.  NOTE: WARM is ONLY for keeping already cooked food at the perfect serving temperature until you are ready to eat. DO NOT cook on the WARM setting.  4. When the cooking time has completed, the Smart-Pot¬Æ slow cooker automatically shifts to the WARM setting and the WARM light illuminates.  NOTE: We do not recommend using the WARM setting for more than 4 hours.  5. To turn the Smart-Pot¬Æ slow cooker off, press the OFF button and unplug the unit from the outlet.  USAGE NOTES:  ‚Ä¢ If there is a power outage, when the power is restored the display and lights blink. All slow cooker settings have been cleared and must be reset. However, the food may be unsafe to eat. If you are unaware of how long the power was out, we suggest you discard the food.  ‚Ä¢ For recipes that require a range of times, select the time closest to the setting on your Smart-Pot¬Æ slow cooker. For instance, to cook a recipe calling for a cooking time of 7 to 9 hours on LOW, set your Smart-Pot¬Æ slow cooker to 8 hours.  ‚Ä¢ To avoid over- or under-cooking, always fill the stoneware ¬Ω to ¬æ full to conform to recommended cook times (with the exception of certain cakes and custards, and as guided otherwise in our slow cooker recipes).  ‚Ä¢ Do not overfill stoneware. To prevent spillover, do not fill stoneware higher than ¬æ full.  http://www.crock-pot.com/CustomerService.aspx?id=man    ",¬Æ

Well, its right there in the abstract.  &gt;We examine relationships among SAT¬Æ, SES, and freshman grades in 41 colleges and universities and show that (a) SES is related to SAT scores (r = 0.42 among the population of SAT takers),  Although I will admit, I haven't bothered to read the whole thing and examine their methodology. Honestly, I don't care about their conclusions enough to do so.  &gt;You may have misunderstood what that section of the paper was about. I will quote the paper's own conclusion of that section to clarify it:  I don't think I misunderstood what that section was about. It was showing that the SES-SAT relationship changes depending on whether you look at students in college or all students who took the test, and provided some speculation as to why this might be. The authors then conclude that the population you are looking at when quoting the SES-SAT correlation should be specified.  Thats why I said  &gt;they give a correlation coefficient between SES and SAT scores of r = 0.42 **in the entire test-taking population.**",¬Æ

So no, it's not *that* big a deal, especially compared to all the shit you lose by drinking Apple's Kool-Aid, such as USB slots, SD card slots, all manner of customizability, etc.  &gt; Who wants to deal with a startup folder and registry entries on a tablet?  You don't have to deal with any of that in Windows 8. Of course it's all there under the hood, just as there's an entire Unix machine under the hood on your iPad.  However, in the case of the iPad, all that shit is locked away from you and Apple aggressively combats all attempts to open it up. As a poweruser, my tablet is an overpriced toy -- a dumbed down appliance for running Apps‚Ñ¢ -- if I can't unlock it. I won't have that issue with a Windows tablet.  You should be hoping the Windows tablet is successful, too, if for no other reason than it may force Apple to climb out of their own ass *just* a little bit and relax some of their restrictions: no Flash, entire classes of apps banned (anything sexual, emulators, anything that competes with them, etc.), no apps allowed low level access to anything, no direct access to the file system, the requirement to use iTunes (\*vomit\*), etc.  I had very high hopes for tablets in music production, especially the iPad which has a very good MIDI implementation compared to Android, but Apple's got the device so locked down it's effectively useless. I mostly use it for games, browsing the web while shitting, watching Netflix in bed, which is all well and good, but it's not even scratching the *surface* of what's possible in this space. Hopefully a more connected, more open platform will shakes things up.  &gt; Who wants a full os without the ability to do so?  You should get all those things.

I respected Republicans and enjoyed debates.  I know this is weird but I keep an open mind and like it when both sides bring something tangible to the table, talk about it openly, make their best case and then try to come to an agreement.  One side will always end up slightly ahead of the other therefore there is technically a winner and a loser, but when compromise is reached, usually neither party is perfectly happy however both parties respect the agreement and everyone gets along.    Right now though.. the GOP has gone off the fucking deep end, Democrats seemed to have moved way more right than I'd ever have imagined but mostly do nothing in response (which bugs me slightly more than them moving a bit to compromise) and any third party voices are basically drowned out altogether.

I doubt her intent is to say that a firebrand is necessarily a faggot, so it is probably best to assume the second interpretation, i.e. Redremnant's logic is accurate, but his conclusion relies on a false premise.",‚Üî

Then, I run the PWR lines through a SPDT switch with the USB A on the middle terminal so it is switched between the two USB B terminals.  So you're switching only the power, but not the data pins? Sounds iffy. Meaning that it might work if and only if...  If on the other hand someone plugs in some powered hubs or USB devices downstream from your switch, much confusion might result, because the device that you think you switched away from might actually be on.  Also, I'm not sure what some USB devices might do when everything but the 5V pin is connected. If a device started drawing power from a data pin, that would probably be a Very Bad Thing‚Ñ¢.

More from that article: ""Back-loading carbs runs against every dietary recommendation to guarantee a solid, strong workout. The body needs carbs to lift heavy, or so the advice goes.""  This actually isn't entirely true, as there are plenty of studies on NIH's PubMed that point to the usefulness of protein prior to a workout. Carb-loading recommendations are generally for endurance training. Not to mention that, even if Kiefer is correct, it would be even more suspect to suggest a diet that current nutritional evidence contraindicates.  I'm not saying this is a bad idea, as I haven't done the research or heard analysis from any independent experts. It might well provide tips that can help an individual improve their diet. Honestly, just eating clean and getting enough protein will be far more effective than any such diet plan.  PS: Here's what [WebMD has to say about spotting fad diets](http://women.webmd.com/fad-diets):  * Recommendations that promise a quick fix. (""The Carb Nite¬Æ Solution is an advanced diet plan designed to strip body fat safely, rapidly and permanently."") * Dire warnings of dangers from a single product or regimen. (""Unfortunately, diet pills and typical diet programs don‚Äôt work when you need to lose those last few pounds."") * Claims that sound too good to be true. (""The Carb Nite¬Æ Solution targets fat cells and is the only diet that creates the magic combination of hormone levels that can actually kill fat cells."") * Simplistic conclusions drawn from a complex study. (""A recent study in the New England Journal of Medicine revealed that even a few extra pounds can increase your risk of death. ... So even if you carry just ten extra pounds, you‚Äôre taking an unnecessary risk."") * Recommendations based on a single study or testimonials. (""This is the most amazing diet I've ever tried. Never before would I have believed I could eat donuts and cheesecake to lose the unwanted pounds. - Meredith, Iowa"") * Dramatic statements that are refuted by reputable scientific organizations. (""The Carb Nite¬Æ Solution ... can actually kill fat cells."") * Lists of 'good' and 'bad' foods. (Not sure if the ""over three hundred pages of food lists"" is good vs bad foods, since I'm not buying the book) * Recommendations made to help sell a product. ([Buy the book!](http://carbnite.com/ns-buythebook.php)) * Recommendations based on studies published without review by other researchers. (I don't know all the studies he's referring to) * Recommendations from studies that ignore differences among individuals or groups. (I don't know all the studies he's referring to) * Eliminating 1 or more of the 5 food groups. (""Cut carbs back to 30 grams or less everyday for ten days."")  All quotes taken from the creator's [website](http://carbnite.com/index.php).

As others have mentioned here, Chaplains perform a number of roles that make no sense to be accomplished by a counselor. Running a breakfast club or organising a charity fun run are not things that requires a trained professional, do they?   &gt;And why wouldn't we simply advocate that the social workers or counselors refer issues to the local parish, where there are always multiple people with qualifications in theology if faith the issue?   That's not always the case, especially in regional areas. Priests etc can travel thousands of km a weekend servicing a large area and don't actually stay in a single town for longer than it takes to hold a service.  It may also be the case that the child has questions arising from something said in his/her local parish, and wants to seek a second opinion. They can't get that if they're going to be referred back to the original source.  &gt;Surely the priority should be on making counselors more readily available, given that these services aren't always accessible outside of the school.

t5_2s580,Sparrowsluck,1340238912,"While thinking about how to respond to this I realized the actual scope of the issue here, so this will probably be long.   First, I feel like LoL is like TF2 in some ways. Not a whole lot of people take either one very seriously, but a large group of people find both games to be fun. Despite how fun either game is, when being compared to a game people feel takes more skill they laugh about how easy either one is. So this adds a bit of humor directed at the game.  Then you have Riot...where to even begin here? People that work at Riot have said some things that will forever go down in LoL history. From the lead designer saying how little he cares about originality to a balance guy talking about anti-fun mechanics. There are so many words that instantly trigger laughs in the LoL community with, ""Soon‚Ñ¢"" and, ""anti-fun,"" being the biggest examples of this. More than their words you have their actions. Taking over 2 years working on 2 stealth champion reworks, and countless other little failures really work against any progress they've made, or will ever make. Those are mere mistakes though, what of their more questionable actions? During dreamhack they replaced the spectator mode window with an ad for dreamhack. So no one could use spectator mode at all (unless you wanted to watch people on your friends list). Then they came in to patch on a day when patches never occur, this was during dreamhack. Coincidentally they had to take the game down during dreamhack due to some errors in the patch, more than half a day later they rolled the patch back entirely. All of this adds lots of humor directed at Riot.   So you have people laughing at the game, and at the company. Why would anyone stay after all that? Well I'm not sure if this has a real name but I've taken to calling it, ""WoW syndrome"". Because you need to grind for stats and champions people pour their time, and often money, into getting their account to a point where they can actually compete. After all that time, energy, and money being spent working on something very few would choose to throw it all away and ""start over"" with a new game. So despite all else the perceived ""value"" of people's accounts keep them chained to the game until they realize there is no reason for them to continue playing. Sadly many people never realize this and turn into those people that violently defend something. This is because they need to believe the game they spent so much time on is worthwhile.  There is a reason so many games, free or not, use an unlock system. ",‚Ñ¢

Here is the thing, unless you edit video, encode video, program, or the like, you will only need an i5.  I would go with a used i5 2500k that is a proven overclocker. You can get good used chips and great forum support at [this site](http://www.overclock.net/).   That will run you about 170 or so, throw in a decent mobo for 150-200 and you got more than you will ever need. Due to the money you just saved pick yourself up an awesome cooler, something like the Silver Arrow, Noctua NH-D14, or a H100.   I recommend www.newegg.com for all your purchases.  In regards to your comments.  &gt;I see the 3770k Memory Type is DDR3-1333/1600 --Does this mean 1600MHz RAM is the fastest that will work?  They will all run 1600mhz just fine.   &gt;Intel¬Æ HD Graphics 4000 --Does this even matter if I get an aftermarket card?  There are some chipsets that support using both on-board and dedicated cards, but they are not worth it and yield little results.   &gt;PCI Express Revision 3.0 -- This means the IVY Bridge CPU can take advantage of PCIe 3.0 and the others can't?  Yes it does. But it doesn't matter. No card can max out PCI Express 2.0 at x16. 3.0 doubles the bandwidth of each lane making x16 effectively x32. This does nothing for gaming, and little for anything else. By little I mean not noticeable.  &gt;Tcase: 67.4¬∞C 3770k vs 72.6¬∞C 2600/2700k -- I read about TCase and TJMax and TJunction, but I'm still lost; can someone throw me a bone here?  Temps on the SB processors is lower because they used fluxless solder. In essence you can overclock a SB processor higher than a IB processor due to the lower temps. But clock for clock an IB processor beats it.    TL;DR  You are worrying about nothing.  Get a i5 2500k or i5 3570k, a Silver Arrow, Noctua NH-D14, or H100, and call it a day.

t5_2qore,cynoclast,1340290705,"DRM isn't bad, it's a flawed concept based on a delusional one.  The idea that you can own, or even control pure information is ludicrous. And any concept or business idea based on that is therefore wishful thinking backed up by current, *changing*, societal norms. Not to be confused with how the universe operates independently of our wishes.  People like to share, it's in our blood from our hunter-gatherer days. And when it literally costs us nothing to share a copy of some information we see clearly and rightly that it is Good‚Ñ¢ to do so. The only people who disagree are those deluded into thinking ownership of information is not only possible, but a good thing. However, we *also* feel guilty getting someone's hard work for nothing. As Louis. C.K. *proved* (IMHO), the people wrong here are the lazy wretches clinging to copyright instead of being paid for work done. Why should they get to do some work once, and get paid for it in perpetuity?  They certainly desire this, and it's obvious why. But what other professions get to do that? Are there *any*? It seems selfish, greedy, and lazy, all at once.  This is all despite the fact that I am a software engineer and my own work can easily be copied etc. But that doesn't matter to me because I can always get paid to do it more. That is, I get paid to do custom work, because I'm good at it and can repeatedly delivery more new work on demand, in a competitive field. And I have to negotiate my rate with each employer.  And people want to charge a non-negotiable price for each cheap or free copy of a work they completed *once*? Forgive me if I have just as much sympathy for them as I do the mouse angerly asking the world who moved *his* cheese. The internet has killed copyright. Get over it, it's done and you can't undo it. Controlling information is going to be an arms race at best, and those who want to stay in the past are forced to rely on lawyers to prop up their obsolete and dying business models instead of evolving like everyone else. I must say, it gives me joy to watch their easy, lazy money streams drying up. It looks like justice from where I sit.  I am not worried, though. The internet is going to prove me right eventually.

t5_2snuc,TreDubZedd,1340291095,"For my part, it has less to do with religion or Christianity, and more to do with societal well-being.  Traditionally, a strong family unit (father and mother, committed to one another, working together to raise children) has been the backbone of society.  In such circumstances, the likelihood of children growing up to be well-adjusted members of society was higher than those children born out-of-wedlock, etc.  For that reason, the state began to provide benefits for families--because it made the state's job easier.  Marriage became a (primarily) state institution.  You may say that children raised by same-sex parents can be as well-adjusted as those raised by a traditional couple.  I would suggest that the data isn't in, yet.  This particular experiment has only just begun.  I would suspect, however--based on historical evidence--that children raised in a traditional family are (on average) more beneficial to society than those raised in any other circumstance.  Until it's proven that same-sex couples are as effective in raising children as traditional couples, I would suggest that experimenting with the basic societal construct of the family is a Bad Idea‚Ñ¢.  You might argue that marriage--as we know it today--doesn't promote the same level of well-adjustedness in children.  I would agree: divorce has become so prevalent as to render the ""commitment"" concept completely irrelevant.  The problem, then, isn't with marriage, but with divorce.  The prevalence of divorce is another one of those experiments on the basic societal construct of the family that has proven to be a Bad Idea‚Ñ¢.  **TL;DR:** Under the traditional family, society prospers.  Experimenting with that family construct hasn't proven to be anywhere near as productive to society.",‚Ñ¢

t5_2smhl,bildo84,1340306614,"INCOMING WALL-O-TEXT!  Over a year ago, in the Yorick patch to League of Legends, Evelynn, the melee AP assassin, received a crippling nerf to her stealth attack. Instead of a hard stun, it was turned into a slow. Since then, she's been at the bottom of the barrel, frequently ribbed about being ‚Äúuseless‚Äù, or calling her ‚Äúa mobile ward.‚Äù Morello, lead champion designer, has even said the hard nerf was intentional, because it was causing people to stop playing League in frustration after getting killed by her repeatedly.  But you know what's funny? I've gotten my ass handed to me by extremely efficient Evelynn players. And I'm not talking about a level 5 account, here, this is like ranked games not even a few weeks ago. The fact is, unless you basically play safe enough early game to stay out of her slow range, she can get you. This kind of strategy does not work when you are all about your early game. And more often than not, a gank from her, combined with the laner and summoner spells will burn you down. The lower the level, the more likely she is to get you.  That's not even considering a lot of other factors ‚Äì her slow is pretty nasty, and if you have someone like Udyr top, or Ryze mid, the combined effort keeps you from returning to your tower. Most shopping is done at level one, and the true counters to Evelynn ‚Äì Oracle's Elixir and vision wards ‚Äì are way too costly. And even then, they're not guaranteed.  Wait, no, don't. Stop. Do not email me ‚Äì I know Eve sucks. She really does. I am not disputing that. This article is not to describe her and Twitch's viability, but instead why pure invisibility, in its current incarnation, is extremely wrong for League of Legends, and is overpowered no matter what it comes with.   Being invisible offers you three things that are absolutely invaluable.  1 ‚Äì Unable to see actions of stealther  How many times have you walked into a brush and, in that millisecond where you vanish, turned around and walked right by them? Juking in this incarnation is a sliver of the power of invisibility. Twitch going invisible and, the second he's gone, turning around and walking right through you, is this.  2 ‚Äì Unable to target them  Tell me how many times you have fired off a skillshot desperately hoping Talon is still where he just used his ult at. In these instances, skillshots are your only hope.  3 ‚Äì Your vision is unreliable  You are in mid lane, as Ryze. Kassadin is coming at you, overextending, even though you can easily root him and unload before he gets close enough to hurt you. Wait. Where's Twitch? He was just at bottom. So you back off. And Twitch shows up at top. The threat of a gank actually standing right on top of you, while you are unaware, can be either mindgames or a very real thing waiting to happen. Very few other champions can do that. The only one I can think of is Shaco.  Really the entire issue is just about having a character appear literally out of nowhere and jump onto you. It's the same reason everyone hates the crap out of Shaco. A quick ‚Äúwhoop‚Äù over a wall, and you've got a few seconds of invisibility to jump on Ezreal, and he is none the wiser. If you have crowd control in the lane, like Nunu or Lux support, or even just Ashe, that's a dead champion. Shaco, however, doesn't have true stealth. But we'll talk about him in a few days.  Just imagine how frustrating and slippery he is, but more of them ‚Äì lots more. If Riot continued making champions like this, you could have a constant rotation of characters going invisible. Imagine finding Nautilus or Udyr exposed in the jungle, and when you jump on him for a quick kill, four of his teammates pop out of nowhere and liquefy you.  Obvious question is, what about Teemo? Or Akali? Look again at the points I made ‚Äì both of their versions of stealth remove one of those points. Teemo cannot take actions while he is standing still, invisible, and Akali's Shroud lets you know exactly where she should be. He can take no actions, and she can be tracked. True invisibility is ridiculous, and they don't have that.  This is why the stealth rework ‚Äì still coming Soon‚Ñ¢, but thankfully closer than you realize ‚Äì is so critical. It doesn't matter how squishy you make the champion, being invisible is incredibly advantageous, and no matter what you do, at low level, that's huge.  ",‚Ñ¢
t5_2s7tt,dusdus,1340306687,"Let's point out the premises of your argument, and show why they're false.  (1) There's no applicability to descriptivism to the outside world.  This isn't true. Every other country in the world does teach a standard language. It's necessary for teaching reading and writing. People get along just fine speaking the standard as well as their native linguistic varieties. It's an issue about contextualizing things appropriately, and not working within a framework in which there is value judgements associated with particular speaking patterns.  (2) The motivation for this way of thinking is political correctness.  No. The motivation for it is *precedence* and *scientific thinking*. We know *for a fact* that teaching within a descriptivist framework radically improves test scores in the relevant areas and actually results in an ironing out in educational inequalities. Furthermore, any objective thinking about language can't be prescriptivist, which is inherently subjective.  (3) The point of rules is to avoid muddling of meaning.  Again, not true. Linguists acknowledge that language is rule-governed. This is obviously true, and if it weren't true, we wouldn't have a job (you can't do science with something that isn't internally consistent!). But those rules that actually govern peoples' knowledge of language has nothing to do with what you learn in schools. But we also know for a fact that the majority of these rules are learned by the age of 3, and experimentation with children and babies show that language is to a large extent mastered well before then, some even claiming that sound systems are learned in utero. So, we know language is rule based and a well suited medium for expressing meaning, but *those rules* you learn in school are completely irrelevant.  (4) Descriptivism entails throwing out all the rules  No, it entails recognizing that they're arbitrary aspects of a particular variety of the language that has been elevated to the ""standard"" variety. It entails understanding that there isn't One Correct Version of English¬Æ and that people who grew up speaking different versions (for instance, people in rural areas, blacks, and hispanics) are NOT acting out of ignorance, but are just speaking a distinct variety in different settings. It might seem subtle, but the facts are on the table that, again, in educational settings, this has a huge impact.  (5) We won't be able to communicate with anyone outside a 5-mile radius if we maintain a positive attitude to non-standard forms.  Again, precedent shows this is just an absurd conclusion. Have you ever heard of people not being able to understand each other in Spain? How about India? India literally has *hundreds* of distinct, mutually unintelligible languages, but they have a standard variety (Castilian Spanish in Spain, Hindi and English in India) that aids communication across groups. Descriptivism does not entail abolishing a standard variety.  (6) English would become fractured.  It's becoming fractured as it is. Studies addressing whether or how telecommunication and the internet would slow or alter linguistic evolution came to a surprising conclusion. It was hypothesized that since telephones and the internet meant we would be talking with people outside of our local area much more frequently, dialects would begin to converge and we'd see significantly less interlinguistic variation. We found the opposite. We don't know why, but we know for a fact that English -- and other languages around the globe -- are actually diverging and evolving pretty swiftly. A standard explanation is citing what I mentioned before -- language is essentially learned in entirety before age 3, well before kids go to school let alone chat on reddit -- and increasing social stratification.",¬Æ

t5_2qxih,MazInger-Z,1340311279,"**Crew Skills and Items in Game Update 1.3**  The next game update for Star Wars‚Ñ¢: The Old Republic‚Ñ¢ includes a handful of key changes to crew skills and item tech that we want to share with you.  **Adaptive Gear Weight**  Adaptive gear is a new kind of armor weight. When you equip Adaptive armor, your character will use it to maximum effect, gaining the benefits of the highest armor weight you can equip. Adaptive armor also works for companions, utilizing their best armor weight. This allows every class in the game to use the social gear sets without being penalized, and without having multiple sets of gear just to set a different weight. With the introduction of the Adaptive armor system in Game Update 1.3, we‚Äôre rolling out these social gear sets with the Adaptive weight:      Balmorran Resistance     Civilian Pilot     CorSec Uniform     Death‚Äôs Claw Armor     Elegent Dress     Formal Suit     Hailstorm Brotherhood     Hutt Cartel     Imperial Dancer     Imperial Pilot     Imperial Trooper     Karagga‚Äôs Unyielding Helm (single item)     Pilot‚Äôs Suit     Prisoner‚Äôs     Republic Officer     Republic Pilot     Sand People     Slave Girl     Ulgo Noble     Voss Mystic  All existing items will be updated, so if you have already acquired them they will show the adaptive weight in 1.3.  **Augment Tables**  Prior to Game Update 1.3, it was only possible to create an Augmented item through a critical crafting success. Augmented items have an additional mod slot, conveniently called an augment. Some of the most valuable items in the game right now are orange shells that have been crafted with an augment slot unlocked, because they have exceptional stat potential with their full complement of mod slots. While these items are cool, they are indicative of a systemic inequity between different types of items. That‚Äôs where Augment Tables come in.  Although we call them Augment Tables, it‚Äôs actually just an update to all the Item Modification Stations you can already find spread throughout the world. These stations provide a new way of adding an augment slot to an item. Since lots of questions come up whenever Augment Tables are mentioned, I‚Äôll try to explain the system by providing those questions and their answers:  **What‚Äôs the goal of the system?**  The goal of the system is to reduce the disparity between gear, making modifiable gear throughout the game statistically viable while providing another means of stat customization and growth for endgame players.  **What can you augment?**  You can augment any equippable item of at least Premium quality. This is pretty much everything in the game except some low level junk loot.  **How do augment slots work?**  Augment slots are tiered, ranging from MK-1 to MK-6. Augments have a required minimum Augment Slot MK-# based on their level. Any Augment Slot MK-# can be applied to any item.  **How can you unlock an augment slot?**  1. Critical craft an item. It will receive an augment slot matching the level of the item. 2. Add an augment slot to an item at a Modification Station.  You can also upgrade an augment slot to a higher MK-# at a Modification Station.  What do I need to add an augment slot? How much does it cost? Credits: A flat credit cost to add or upgrade an augment. Credit costs are still being tuned, but it will be less than 50k for the highest augment slot.  Augment Kit: An item produced by Armormechs, Synthweavers and Armstechs. Augment Kits require 10 Augment Slot Components of the appropriate MK-#. Components are acquired by Reverse Engineering any item that can be crit-crafted to add an augment slot. The component result is not random: you will get one component per crit-craftable item RE‚Äôd, regardless of quality or item type. The component is an addition to the current RE results, so it will not replace any of the materials you currently get from RE.  **What are the tiers?**  Based on item levels (which can be higher than required levels): Slot                                            Level Min        Level Max Augmentation Slot MK-1                 1                     16 Augmentation Slot MK-2                 17                   24 Augmentation Slot MK-3                 25                   32 Augmentation Slot MK-4                 33                   40 Augmentation Slot MK-5                 41                   48 Augmentation Slot MK-6                 49+  Any tier of augment slot can be applied to any item. The MK-# just restricts which augments can be inserted into the item. We will periodically add more levels of augments and augment slots.  **What happens to my existing items?**  If the augment slot is empty, it will get an Augment Slot MK-# based on the level of the item. This will be the same slot it will receive if you crit craft the item after 1.3.  If the augment slot is populated, it will get an Augment Slot MK-# based on the higher of either the level of the item or the level of the inserted augment.  **What about my social gear?**  Since Augment Slots can be added to all equipment slots and all gear at Premium quality or greater, this means social gear can be augmented.  **How do augment tables fit in with the long term goals for itemization and crew skills?**  Augment Tables are a great example of some of our goals for modifications, crew skills and itemization in general.  *Customization:* We want to give players more control of their stats and appearance. We want players to be able to choose what gear they want, and avoid or eliminate cases where players are forced into specific choices due to arbitrary system rules.",‚Ñ¢

t5_2qh1u,giants4635,1340335548,"There is always something unsettling about pioneering your way through the unknown without feasible means to an end.  But for the The Lightfighters, with great risk, dedication and persistence, comes great reward. In this case, reward isn‚Äôt fame, but longevity and artistic freedom. Formed in Monterey, Ca. in 2007, this band is all too familiar with  facing the hardships and competition in a digital age of music. The over-saturated tripe that blares over the mainstream radio, television, and multimedia can be discouraging but has motivated this band to taking an alternative route. The Lightfighters choose to have no labels, publicists, or producers and instead have found their own path to self-attained musical prowess.   ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt want to become the here today and gone tomorrow type of band,‚Äù says vocalist and keyboardist Jonathan Griffin. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôd rather continue to make music consistently and make a difference for our fans than become incredibly famous.‚Äù  This five- piece band has already found success online while licensing their music in film,  Rockband‚Ñ¢Ô°ø video games, internationally in China, and here in the U.S. domestically.  Even more than that, however, is a group that is more willing to give than to receive.  Their music is featured in a film to raise awareness about Huntington's disease in hopes of finding a cure. Their songs have also been used on ""Music for the Troops Radio"" to help soldiers overseas and have made it onto compilation albums such as Give To The Gulf, an album whose proceeds help victims of Hurricane's Katrina and Rita. The Lightfighters continue to play live shows at various charitable events.    ""To me, success is inspiring people through our music,‚Äù says Griffin. ‚ÄúBecause we aren‚Äôt tied down to a label, we are able to market our music wherever we choose.‚Äù After going through several line-up changes over the years and finding the right group of people, the sound, which mixes a plethora of genres, has never been better.  Lead vocalist Savannah Keen can belt out raspy growls with the likes of Janis Joplin, then deliver sultry ballads with a uniqueness and conviction that makes every song her own.  Bassist Chris Castillo has implemented southern California-style grooves intertwined with aggressive, yet melodic lines while holding down the rhythm section.  Drummer Eric Crago anchors the band with his flourishes all around the kit and virtuous interplay with lead instruments, blending jazz and rock drumming styles.  Rounding out the group is lead guitarist Mario Cardoso, whose guitar-god influences in Hendrix, Santana, and Stevie Ray Vaughn give vivid sensibility to each song without taking away from his own raw authenticity.    Wikipedia describes The Lightfighters as an ""alternative rock and do-it-yourself indie band."" While loose as those terms may be, it gives the impression they are not waiting for anyone to come and save them.  ""We are in control of our own destiny, that is the new model for musicians in this day and age,"" says Griffin. ""Fans and the artists are more in control now than anything, there is another music revolution on the horizon, we are close to turning a corner, and hopefully we will be a part of it when that day comes.""",‚Ñ¢

t5_2qzbh,diglyd,1340362533,"A few helpful suggestions....  1st rule of having a web design business is:  Ensure that your own website is perfect and free of grammatical, UI, or design errors or inconsistencies no matter how trivial as it is a reflection of the quality of your work.   here is a little example...  under your ""our services page"" where it says website with 3 pages.  it says ""gome"" instead of home.   Under why choose us section, some of your fonts are different colors for no apparent reason.   Your portfolio: Drew's Garage: (1st image in your auto rotator)     This is their website...http://www.drewsgarageonline.com/ so either link to it or make sure a client can't get there because if you don't link your past clients your potential clients will try to find them and contact them to figure out if you are worth the time and $$$$.   So after going to Drew's garage I noticed that it is made by...ready..TAT TAT TA TA: ¬©2011 Drew's Garage Website Design and Maintained by Spark Your Ideas, LLC. Programming and Phoenix SEO by Brian Webb  The website of the developer who build this site is: http://www.sparkyourideas.com/     That obviously is not you guys so its either someone on your team who worked on this site under another company at which point you have no right to claim the credit as all assets belong to said company regardless of the individual who designed it if he worked for them at the time, or I call bullshit and you just ripped off someone else's work.      Either way regardless of what the truth is...if I am a potential client looking for a site developer you just got eliminated for not being honest or having a portfolio that links to someone else's work.  (at least from my point of view after looking at the actual client sites). You guys need to ensure things match up and the trail leads back to you.   I am a business owner and when I see something like this I close your site and say ""amateurs"" or ""this is bullshit""...and leave and tell others not to go there.   I didn't bother looking for the other ones...  You only get 1 (ONE) shot to make the RIGHT first impression.    -Some additional comments:     Under the section WHY CHOOSE EXPONENTIAL WEB MARKETING? you state that many other firms take 2 to 6 months to design a site. This is clearly not true and only applies to complex sties, storefronts, or custom frameworks, and or lots of back end customization or web services integration or custom reporting. Since you do not advertise that you perform custom framework development or e-com integration or serious enterprise development i would expect you to be able to produce a basic site relatively quickly. 99% of other web businesses have the same turn around as you do and most people these days know it does not take that long to build a site. So what makes you better?     Speaking of which, what are your client websites build on? Do you use templates or custom work? Do you use wordpress or joomla or octopress or what? Do you provide windows sites or linux based sites? Is there a mobile version of the site included? if no why not? Are the sites HTML5 and ipad compatible? Do you do custom graphics? What SEO services do you provide? What if I already have a domain name and don't need a free one do I get a discount? What if I need an adult business site done? Do you guys provide those services too?      You claim the websites are ""always expendable"" how? what does this mean? As a client can I expand them myself? Do you build them to be expandable so that I can do it or that you can do it? Does that mean that because they are always expandable next time I call you for some additional work you won't charge me as much since the site is already designed to be expandable?      Since your first year of hosting is free do you provide the support also for free for the first year? What type of hosting is it? is it shared, is it a private server? is it on the cloud? What are the costs afterwards?    -You also mention how you streamlined your process and you claim that after an hour you will have enough information to proceed and won't contact me again until the site is done. This alone give me the following impression:  1. how can you know only after an hour what my business is all about in addition to going over in detail about your services and pricing and answering my questions all at the same time? (that is a very arrogant assumption on your part).   2. Why would you not work with me on this or give me some sort of phased review process?  3. You are full of shit because there is no way you can know enough about my true ""need"" in an hour.       So lets say for example my business has a shielded anechoic chamber facility and we do EMI testing services and I need a site that shows the various services we provide.      So you are saying that in the span of 1 hour you will know enough about my business to whip out the entire site? What about the content? Do I as a customer have to send you the copy within an hour? How will you know what goes on my services page? I don't have anything written down I'm a business owner.  (See where I am going with this?....its not a good thing to say that all you will need will be an hour. It does not give me a warm fuzzy.)     What about images? What if I need to have images created and put on the site? I can't use stock images. How does that work? For example as a client I might want to have professional images done of my test facilities and I don't have any equipment or staff to do this? How are you handling this since you state that after the first hour you won't communicate with me again until the site is done for me to review?   Speaking of images how many images do I get with each page? What about video?      What if I have allot of video? If the first year of hosting is ""free"" do you cover the bandwidth costsfor streaming media during that year? What if my site gets ""fireballed"" from Reddit and I get 5,000-50,000+ visitors all at once because someone links to an article I posted on the blog from the /r Science subredit. Do you cover the costs of this bandwidth increase/spike since hosting is free for the first year? Will the site stay up? Do you guarantee this? if my site goes down do you cover the downtime costs? (see where I am going with this? There are other factors to consider if you put certain info on your site or make certain claims about anything being ""free"").      Why do I only get 1 personalized link? is that like a special link just for me? What about a contact us link so people can send email? is that not included? What about a join our mailing list link? Is that special or part of the package? What about if I need someone to fill out a form or sign up for a newsletter? Is that part of the deal?   When you finish the site a week or 3 days later (depending on the package I choose) if I review the site and don't like it then what happens? Do you spend another week redesigning? I thought you would not bother me and let me focus on running my business according to your site. Do you start over or give me a refund? How is this review process going to be facilitated? How many changes do I get to make per page? How many times total?     What if you can't meet your deadline of 1 week or 1 month while building my site? What recourse do I have since you failed in your verbal contract as stated on your site? Do I get a refund? Do you offer a money back guarantee?   What about my white papers, materials, test results or other info I might want to put on the site? If I give them to you within that hour are you going to know what to do with them?  Also who is your team and where are your offices if you are Arizona local?   -As a business owner I want to know that you exist. What is your team composed of and what is their background? Add a about us page and list each team member with an image and their background or resume.      You state ""Every team member at Exponential Web Marketing is a local Arizona resident. Having done years of freelancing and work with other major firms in Arizona, we have chosen to come together to create a smaller company to provide businesses like yours with incredible results.""     What other major firms have you worked with? What ""incredible results"" are you referring to specifically? Where are the references and/or links to these major companies that you worked with on your site? What did the work consist of and where are the examples? Provide references to individuals at these companies who can vouch for these claims or don't say bullshit like this or someone will call you out on it.      you probably want to say came together as a strong team or formed a team of talented individuals instead of saying ""smaller company"". It almost sounds like you were part of something bigger it did not work out and you formed a smaller one. Why would that make me want to work with you?     If I want to schedule my 15 minute consultation what phone number can I reach you at? If I want to speak to one of these super talented and exceptional individuals so I can get some answers who do I call and what is the number?   See what I am getting at....your site does not leave me with that warm fuzzy feeling.      Its missing the most basic things that make me ""the customer"" comfortable that you are professional and that my money will be well spent.   Be careful what you say. Make sure that you can back up anything that you say. If you can't back it up don't put it on there. Don't just write some bullshit how you worked with all these clients and companies and how great you are without providing proof.   -Fix that shit and good luck. I'm just trying to help you out by giving you a no BS impression of your site after viewing it as I am a customer who was looking for someone to build me a site and I have been looking at allot of web dev sites lately.   -There is no such thing as an ""in progress site"". if you are starting a business and especially if you are in the web design business and you put up a site it better be ready to go. This isn't a community site you are building . This is a reflection of the service you provide. It should be the best it can be. If its not then you are not ready to do business. (and keep in mind that I didn't even bother to inspect any code elements of your site to see if you used a template or built the site yourself or to see what its running on to determine its ""form"" and code ""cleanliness"" and adherence to standards. Some might do this like a mechanic buddy going along with you to check out a used car).

t5_2qh2v,halfprice06,1340377433,"Washington Post Reporter Finds Holes in China's Tiananmen Immolation Story  (Philip P. Pan    2/6/01 11:17)  KAIFENG, China (Washington Post Foreign Service) -- There is a neighborhood on the eastern side of this once-glorious city called Apple Orchard, but there are no apple trees here, only drab concrete buildings and clusters of unemployed men loitering on mud streets. It was here, in a fourth-floor apartment in Building Six, that Liu Chunling and her 12-year-old daughter, Liu Siying, lived.  The mother was a quiet woman who kept to herself, the daughter a lively fifth-grader who never failed to smile and say hello. Neighbors recalled there was something both strange and sad about Liu Chunling, that she sometimes hit her child, that she drove her elderly mother away, that she worked in a nightclub and took money to keep men company.  But no one suspected that Liu, 36, might have joined the banned spiritual movement Falun Gong. And hardly anyone noticed when she and her daughter disappeared.  And then, there they were on national television, their bodies engulfed in orange flames in Tiananmen Square. Liu Siying was shown lying on a stretcher, her face and lips charred black, whimpering, ""Mama, mama."" Her mother, the newscast reported, was already dead.  What drove the Lius and three others from this city in central Henan province, about 350 miles south of Beijing, to pour gasoline on their bodies and set themselves afire on Jan. 23, the eve of the Chinese New Year?  An intense battle is underway to answer that question, with the five individuals cast in turn as victims of an evil cult, righteous protesters against a repressive government or desperately estranged people on the margins of a fast-changing society.  The ruling Communist Party has launched an all-out campaign to use the incident to prove its claim that Falun Gong is a dangerous cult, and to turn public opinion in China and abroad against the group it outlawed 18 months ago and has tried to crush, at times with brutal tactics.  Every morning and night, the state-controlled media carry fresh attacks against Falun Gong and its U.S.-based leader, Li Hongzhi. Schools have been ordered to ""educate"" pupils about the sect. Discussion meetings have been organized in factories, offices and universities. Religious leaders as far away as Tibet have delivered scripted denunciations. In Kaifeng, the post office issued an anti-Falun Gong postmark, and 10,000 people signed a public petition against the group.  China has also used the incident to pressure Hong Kong to ban Falun Gong, testing the strength of the ""one country, two systems"" setup that gives the former British colony autonomy over its affairs. Falun Gong exists legally in Hong Kong, but the territory's security chief warned Thursday that police intend to monitor the group's activities closely.  Falun Gong leaders insist that the Lius and their companions could not have been members of their movement, which promotes a mix of Buddhism, Taoism and traditional Chinese breathing exercises. They have said Falun Gong clearly forbids both violence and suicide and have suggested the government may have staged the incident.  Other human rights activists say the five set themselves on fire to protest the government's crackdown on Falun Gong, which has resulted in thousands of arrests and as many as 105 deaths in police custody. All but 12-year-old Liu Siying had protested Beijing's actions against Falun Gong in Tiananmen Square previously, according to the Hong Kong-based Information Center for Human Rights and Democracy.  There is a tradition of politically motivated suicide in China. At the start of China's last dynasty, in the 1640s, hundreds of people killed themselves rather than live under the conquering Manchus. More than 250 years later, several students committed suicide to protest the Qing Dynasty's refusal to establish a constitutional republic. Most recently, countless Chinese took their lives to escape the abuse of Mao Zedong's Cultural Revolution.  But there is hardly any precedent for public self-immolation. In Kaifeng, a city of 700,000 that was China's imperial capital and one of the world's most populous cities at the turn of the last millennium, most residents took a dim view of what Liu and the others did.  ""They disgraced Kaifeng, and they disgraced China in front of the whole world. It was just too much!"" said Tang Shaohua, 60, who runs a grocery around the corner from Liu's home.  ""It's so sad what happened to that little girl. I used to see her playing around here,"" added neighbor Zhang Binglian, 60. ""Falun Gong is an evil cult. I thought that before, and I'm even more convinced now.""  But even in Kaifeng, there are signs that the government's propaganda campaigns have lost some of their effectiveness. Several residents expressed weariness with the barrage against Falun Gong.  ""I'm not saying I don't believe the government, but I'm not saying I believe it, either,"" said Liu Xiaoyu, 39, as she made dumplings in Kaifeng's lively night market. ""The government controls the news. We all know that now.""  Cab driver Wang Chaohui said he believed Falun Gong was a religion like any other, and said it would be unfair to blame the acts of five individuals on a group with millions of practitioners. In any case, he said, the crackdown on Falun Gong was sure to backfire.  ""China is different now, and they can't arrest everybody who believes in something like this,"" he said. ""It only makes things worse.""  Wang said the real question China must confront is why so many people believe in something like Falun Gong. ""People are dissatisfied with society,"" he said. ""That's the problem.""  Like the rest of China, Kaifeng has experienced a revival in all kinds of religions as communist ideology has lost its appeal. Over the past decade, residents have turned in large numbers to Christianity, Buddhism, Taoism -- and Falun Gong. Before the group was banned, hundreds practiced its meditation exercises in the city's parks.  Falun Gong has attracted a cross section of Chinese -- party members, senior army officers, bureaucrats, teachers and millions living on the margins of society. In Kaifeng, where several factories have closed and the economy has slumped, many are searching for something to believe in.  The state media have said little about why the five who set themselves on fire might have joined Falun Gong. Beijing denied requests to interview Liu Siying and the three other survivors, who are all hospitalized with serious burns. A Kaifeng official said only China Central Television and the official New China News Agency were permitted to speak to their relatives or their colleagues. A man who answered the door at the Liu home referred questions to the government.  But Liu Chunling's Apple Orchard neighbors described her as a woman who led a troubled life and suffered from psychological problems. State media identified 78-year-old Hao Xiuzhen as her adoptive mother. Neighbors said they quarreled often before Liu drove the woman from their home last year.  ""There was something wrong with her,"" said neighbor Liu Min, 51. ""She hit her mother, and her mother was crying and yelling. She hit her daughter, too.""  There were also questions about how Liu supported herself and about the whereabouts of her daughter's father. Neighbors said Liu was not a native of Kaifeng, and that a man in southern Guangdong province paid her rent. Others, including neighbor Wen Jian, 22, said Liu worked in a local nightclub and was paid to dine with and dance with customers.  None ever saw her practice Falun Gong.  ¬© 2001 The Washington Post (Philip P. Pan    2/6/01 11:17)",¬©

t5_2smzw,SomePostMan,1340386321,"My best (shitty) guess:  In replacement tricks like this, the special card is often pre-chosen.  1. The 7‚ô¶ was pre-chosen, just like he joked (""it's okay if I see the card... I've seen this trick before""). He palmed the 7‚ô¶ in on top of Deck #1 [2:38 ... his hands appear empty at least for a moment but the angle and cut is limiting], the one he opened and that Penn shuffled. (Note that he didn't ask Penn to pick a random card, but the one ""on the back"".)  2. He swapped decks when he took the pen out [2:49] (as Penn noticed). The ""cooler"" deck that he brought in was:   ¬∑ a shuffled deck with the joker, premiums, and 7‚ô¶ taken out, facing up;   ¬∑ with the bottom half of the deck (8‚ô¶ and up) slightly pushed out (~1/16"") to make that slot easy to access;   ¬∑ snugly in the box, with the bottom open, in the wrapper, with the bottom of the wrapper open;   ¬∑ with a bit of easy adhesive (e.g. post-it-note glue, which won't smear or dry but will stay put for a second);   ¬∑ with one custom-made extra-large card (~1/8"" wider, ~3/8"" longer) on top of it all to conceal the fact that the deck's in a box, sealed, and the bottom's hanging out.   (Note the angle of the deck toward the camera to maximize this effect.)  3. He finds the split in the deck and slides the signed 7‚ô¶ *face-down* into the deck at that spot (you can see him sliding it in carefully), then closes the bottom of the box and the wrapper behind it [3:00] while misdirecting with the Penn-pen joke and the sway of his body and laughing. Note his right thumb &amp; co. lingering near the bottom of the deck for a few seconds longer (camera angle limiting again).  4. He places the whole thing (sealed box with custom card on top) into Penn's hand, with his hand on top of the custom card, and has Penn cover it before removing the custom card.   &amp;nbsp;   (Sidenote:   ""Would it be impressive if I pulled out your card?"" This is to incorporate this seemingly-superfluous card into the act, so it doesn't seem so suspicious.   ""That would be very impressive."" Penn's just playing along and being nice. That trick alone would require only a slight palming of the card, and no deck switch.)   &amp;nbsp;   He claims the custom card he removed was the joker (and he probably made it a joker on the face side to be safe, although the camera contrast is too high to see) (of course, the cooler deck-box-wrapper never had a joker to begin with).  ‚Ä¢ Voila: Penn's holding a resealed deck containing 52 factory-ordered cards with his in the correct spot, but turned around. Shawn has him inspect the outside but not open it: there are no slits. He tears off the seal from the top. (It appears that he left the bottom of the seal on the deck, but again there's a camera cut. That might have been important or not depending on how he messed with the bottom.) The rest is automatic and he's very careful to turn the 7‚ô¶ around by the tips of his fingers so no one can suspect he simply palmed it in at the last moment.",‚ô¶

(The ""boogeyman"" labeling here being an observation of the exposure of blatant bias in modern measurements making past measurements highly suspect.)  2. Feminists begin looking for proof of The Patriarchy‚Ñ¢. (IE, not scientifically trying to disprove their ideas and thus running forward under the assumption it was true.)  3. Feminists begin using convenient numbers/statistics without caring how about inherent collection/measurement biases. (Rape arrests, domestic abuse arrests, etc.)  4. Feminists begin insisting we exist in a Rape Culture (that men are telling each other it's okay to rape women) and that men rape more than women (far more male rapist arrests/measured).  5. Feminists also insist that men are more violent and commit more domestic abuse to socially keep women down (far more male abuser arrests/measured).  6. Feminists continuing to push these paint a picture of inherent male danger. (Which further leads to biases in divorce and family courts.)  7. As the inevitable backlash against the clearly sexist application of these unfounded assumption and statistics begins to manifest, individuals and organizations begin to hide their blatant sexism (""the clearly-more-dangerous men aren't allowed to take pictures of kids"") are hid behind a thin veil of ""equality"" (""~~the clearly-more-dangerous men~~ parents aren't allowed to take pictures of kids"")  Note that feminism isn't necessarily responsible for the seeds that started a lot of this craziness (and I don't believe it is) but, by all appearances, is responsible for cultivating and growing it. Then, people/organizations beginning to feel the inevitable cognitive dissonance between feminism and the reality of what they're doing take the easy (socially safer) way out and cover it up (with blanket bans) instead of questioning the underlying contradiction.

t5_2qxih,Pryach,1340402330,"**Legacy Perks in Game Update 1.3**  Hi, I‚Äôm Senior Game Designer William Wallace. In Game Update 1.2, we introduced Legacy Unlocks, a system in which characters across your Legacy could unlock special rewards for reaching different milestones. Since Game Update 1.2 went live, your Smuggler may have learned a new skill from their Sith Inquisitor father, or you might have unlocked new species options for your classes. No matter your personal choices, you have now started to build your very own Star Wars‚Ñ¢ legacy.  With Game Update 1.3, we are continuing to expand the Legacy system by introducing the new Character Perks system. Character Perks allow you to customize each character in your Legacy, allowing you to modify how you level them with modifiers to increase the experience you gain from Flashpoints or Space Missions. Character Perks will also grant your Legacy character new conveniences that are useful both during leveling and once you‚Äôve reached level 50.  Character Perks differ from Legacy Unlocks in a couple of different ways. The most obvious difference is that while Legacy Unlocks apply to all characters in your Legacy, Character Perks only apply to a single character, allowing you to customize that particular character. Also, while most Global Unlocks can be earned through normal play or can alternately be purchased for credits, Character Perks can only be purchased using in-game credits. As Character Perks apply only to a single character, their credit costs are significantly lower than most Global Unlocks. Some Character Perks are also restricted by Legacy level and character level in addition to having a credit cost.  Let‚Äôs take a look at the types of Perks we‚Äôre adding for Game Update 1.3!  **Advancement Perks**  Everyone has their favorite activities in The Old Republic, so we thought it‚Äôd be cool to allow you to level new characters with an emphasis on those activities. As such, we‚Äôre adding a set of Advancement Perks in Game Update 1.3 that allow you to gain bonus experience from doing your favorite activities in game. Play the way you want to play and you‚Äôll get rewarded for it!  There are five categories of modification perks in 1.3:  * Class Mission modifiers, which increase the amount of experience you gain from completing your character‚Äôs story missions. * Warzone modifiers, which increase the amount of experience gained from completing PvP warzones. * Space Mission modifiers, which increase the amount of experience gained from completing space missions. * Exploration modifiers, which increase the amount of experience from finding new areas in the game world. * Flashpoint modifiers, which increase the amount of experience you receive from defeating enemies in Flashpoints.  Our goal with experience modifier perks is to make it easier for you to level up new members of your Legacy by focusing on the parts of the game you enjoy most. Just want to focus on the story? Buy up all of the Class Mission modifiers, and you‚Äôll receive a significant bonus to the experience you receive from doing them. Figure you‚Äôll be traveling a lot while you do that? Pick up the Exploration modifiers, so that every time you uncover a new part of the map you get a little extra experience.  **Travel Perks**  The Travel Perks introduced with Game Update 1.3 will help new and old characters alike get around the galaxy a little easier.   For new characters that are leveling up, we‚Äôre introducing Improved Speeder Piloting perks that allow characters to operate speeders at earlier levels than before. The first tier speeder license allows level 10 characters to get Speeder Piloting I. The second tier grants Speeder Piloting II at level 30. The third grants Speeder Piloting III at level 40, giving your character access to level 50 speeders ten levels early.  Your more seasoned characters will also be offered new Priority Transport abilities. These abilities work like our existing Emergency Fleet Pass, whisking you off to your destination immediately. One new ability takes you directly to your Fleet Vanguard Vessels (the Gav Daragon or Ziost Shadow), and shares a cooldown with your normal fleet pass. Three others take you to your character‚Äôs Capital World (Coruscant or Dromund Kaas), the Outlaw‚Äôs Den on Tatooine, or the Black Hole on Corellia.  **Companion Perks**  Companion Perks modify the way that you interact with your companions, as well as making them more useful to you at both low and high levels.   You can purchase perks that modify the rate that you gain affection with your companions, both from giving them gifts and from the choices you make during conversations. These perks will make it considerably easier to reach your Companion‚Äôs Global Unlocks, or to allow you to get on your companion‚Äôs good side if you have spent a lot of time mistreating them. There is also a set of perks that increases the chance that your companions will achieve a critical success when using crafting skills, and you can even modify the length of time that they are gone selling your trash items, so that they‚Äôre only gone a quick few seconds instead of waiting around a full minute for them to return.  **Convenience Perks**  Tired of being caught out in battle with damaged gear? Didn‚Äôt bring the medpacs you thought you had? Try the Field Repair Droid perk. At the lowest level of the perk, this Convenience Perk summons a Droid that will repair your damaged gear. At the second rank of the perk, the Droid carries a full range of adrenals and medpacs. At the third and final rank, the Droid also acts as a full-service Crew Skills material vendor, carrying all of the Thermoplast Flux, Fibrous Nylite Solutions and Brocart Filaments that you need. The Field Repair Droid also acts as a vendor at all levels, so you and your allies can unload unwanted gear while on the go.  What if you‚Äôre handling important auctions on the Galactic Trade Network and need to access your mail? Another Convenience Perk will let you summon a mail Droid assistant with the Field Mail Droid perk. The Droid assistant acts as a mailbox wherever you need one.   Finally, we also offer a perk which allows you to reset your skill trees from anywhere in the game. The Field Respecialization perk adds a new button to your skill tree window that enables this feature. Re-specializing in the field costs the same as it would if you did it in a city, and continues to increase in cost the same that it does normally. It functions identically to the current system, except that you can access it from anywhere once you have this perk.  The Legacy system will continue to improve and expand beyond Game Update 1.3. Our team is constantly looking at new ways of enhancing the experience for all of your Legacy characters, as well as providing new conveniences and fun little perks for everyone in your family tree. As always, we want to hear your feedback so jump on the Public Test Server and let us know what you think!  William Wallace Senior Game Designer",‚Ñ¢

t5_2qh2p,Dudesan,1340412513,"Remember, many Christians find it more comfortable to believe in a god who doesn't condone, command or commit murder, slavery, rape, child abuse, animal abuse, arson, torture, ritual mutilation, fratricide, patricide, matricide, infanticide, genocide, and so on than to believe in one who does. Unfortunately, since the Bible (Old Testamant and New) is pretty clear about Yahweh's position on these things, holding a belief in Loving Hippie Jesus‚Ñ¢ requires ignoring huge portions of it. Or just never reading it in the first place, which seems to be the most popular option.  Well, let's say what Jesus has to say about that:  &gt;‚ÄúDo not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished.  (Matthew 5:17-18, NIV)  Some Christians claim that his death and resurrection ""fulfill"" this. That is bullshit for one simple reason: last time I checked, Heaven and Earth haven't passed away.  Jesus also made his views on people ""picking and choosing"" quite clear:  &gt;[Jesus] answered them, ‚ÄúAnd why do you break God‚Äôs commandment because of your tradition? For God said:    *Honor your father and your mother;* and, *The one who speaks evil of father or mother must be put to death.*  &gt; But you say, ‚ÄòWhoever tells his father or mother, ‚ÄúWhatever benefit you might have received from me is a gift committed to the temple‚Äù‚Äî  he does not have to honor his father.‚Äô In this way, you have revoked God‚Äôs word because of your tradition. Hypocrites! Isaiah prophesied correctly about you when he said:    &gt;These people honor Me with their lips, but their heart is far from Me.  They worship Me in vain, teaching as doctrines the commands of men.‚Äù  (Matthew 15:3-9, NIV)   Looks like Jesus has quite a bit to say about people who ignore commandments, in fact. But maybe it's just Matthew?  &gt;It is easier for heaven and earth to disappear than for the least stroke of a pen to drop out of the Law.  (Luke 16:17, NIV)  Okay, so Jesus is a bust. Let's see what the Epistles have to say about the Mosaic Code:  &gt; If you really keep the royal law found in Scripture, ‚ÄúLove your neighbor as yourself,‚Äù you are doing right.  But if you show favoritism, you sin and are convicted by the law as lawbreakers. For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it.   (James 2:8-10, NIV)  &gt;All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness,  (2 Timothy 3:16)  &gt;Do we, then, nullify the law by this faith? Not at all! Rather, we uphold the law.  (Romans 3:31)  &gt;Know this first of all, that *there is no prophecy of scripture that is a matter of personal interpretation*, for no prophecy ever came through human will; but rather human beings moved by the holy Spirit spoke under the influence of God.""  (2 Peter 1:20-21 NAB)  Well, shit.   This problem disappears quite quickly if you assert that most of the Bible is hogwash, and you only care about the good parts. If you prefer to cling to it as an inspired document, vague mutterings about ""context"" or about Jesus abolishing the old Law won't get you anywhere. ",‚Ñ¢

So, I head out to the local DQ which is old and small with no drive thru, so I have to go inside.  I walk in as they are about to close.  Two young young girls, that just got off their shift, were sitting at one of the two booths.  One of them says they are closing but will get the guy in the back to make me something.

t5_2r0gj,idioma,1340455551,"Pay the extortion, but pay close attention to your wife and her emotional state. Telling her how you feel about the LDS church is going to be worse in a lot of ways than death of a close family member. If you are sealed to her, it is going to be a massive blow to learn that you two won't be together forever since you're an apostate. She will feel betrayed by you and very confused since it sounds like you really do love her; I'm guessing that is mutual.  As for the Bishop: This is a good chance for you to learn to tell people ""no"". Don't say you'll pray about it. Don't be lukewarm in your approach either. Tell him that your wife is grieving right now and that your marriage is rightfully your top priority and that nothing could make you put the church before your own wife and family. I don‚Äôt know if your bishop is a good guy or not, mileage varies quite a bit in that department ‚Äì especially since they are unpaid and untrained non-professionals. The thing is, a good man in that position would fully accept you for having your priorities in order. Anything else means that this guy is a class-A prick and he doesn‚Äôt deserve anything from you. Fuck him.  This is where being good at saying ‚Äúno‚Äù comes in. The Bishop likely does have a few tricks in his bag; I‚Äôll go over a few of these:  - Threats of withdrawing the spirit or advising you that this is a ‚Äútest from god‚Äù or a ‚Äútest of your faith‚Äù.  These are irrelevant, you don‚Äôt believe in any of that hocus pocus, and even though he doesn‚Äôt know that, you can still use this factor to your advantage:  ‚ÄúI know you feel really good about calling me to do this, and I‚Äôm sure you are very disappointed to find out that I‚Äôm not available at this time; but I‚Äôm sure God wouldn‚Äôt give you a challenge that you couldn‚Äôt overcome. If The Lord has put me in this situation, it must be for a good reason, and may that reason is for someone with less teaching experience to receive a calling of this kind.‚Äù  You throw that spiritual-cash-and-prizes-super-challenge bullshit right back in his face.  - ‚ÄúI want you to go home and pray about this.‚Äù  Actually, as soon as you said that you wanted to see me, I had a very strong feeling that I needed to pray and when I did‚Ä¶(fill in the details here); when I was praying I kept thinking about how much I love my wife and how important she is to me.

It was such a powerful experience, blah, blah, blah, I thought I‚Äôd be more conflicted but *The Spirit¬©* made it so clear to me ‚Äì My wife should be my top priority right now.  If he can‚Äôt accept that as a valid exemption then you simply say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, but this isn‚Äôt even about me, it is about Her. Nothing you could say would make me forget how much I love my wife.

t5_2qh68,thedarkerside,1340470827,"The argument is still valid because the system you grow up in will most certainly have an impact on how you perceive the world. It's one thing to sit in your warm, comfy chair, look at the system and say ""Oh look at all these things that are broken, if only...."" without ever having to actually build something from scratch.  &gt; The way most modern democracies currently work involves a large government providing many services.  Certainly, but it's not like we arrived at the present system by waking up one morning and suddenly living this way. It's been a long trek to get there. Mistakes were (obviously) made and we shouldn't just accept the status quo, but this entire idea of a small state goes against the way we humans have organized ourselves for the last few thousand years. Our societies have grown and with that the associated cost, though we are STILL living better, have more stuff and are safer than ever before in human history.  So for all the ""tax waste"" we do seem to get our fair share in return, it's just that many of the benefits aren't as tangible as a big screen TV.  &gt; They're asking: could we derive equal or more benefit (either in terms of quality of service or the intangible individual freedom) for less cost.  Here's the thing though: I do have a strong Libertarian streak too, but exactly because of that the last thing I want is an EFFICIENT Government. I rather have them waste a few billion a year on stupid things than being hyper efficient in everything they do. Every time in history we had an efficient Government things usually didn't work out so well for the common man.  But let's also be honest here, the current crop of Libertarians, much like the current crop of Conservatives, aren't really about that. They have a completely different agenda and would prefer the Government to stay out of their lives completely, at least that's their marketing strategy. (Think Grover Norquist and wanting to shrink the Government until he can drown it in the bathtub).  &gt; If you start with the premise ""Look, you benefited from services provided by the government in the past, therefore you can't change the amount of services the government provides"", you're shutting down the conversation before it has a chance to start.  No that wasn't actually what I was trying to do. My question, has been to others and I guess to you: What Government services do you want to give up and have the private sector pay for.  To get back to the whole idea about healthcare and inelasticity: One of the reason why the US system is so overly expensive is because there re so many actors that all need to be kept in sync / checked on. That drives cost right through the roof and then some. So there is already one area where I personally think the private sector can be a supplier, but not the ""owner"" of the process if that makes sense.  &gt; Many people who advance the case of smaller government aren't equating smaller government with fewer services, btw. Humans are social creatures; many libertarians / fiscal conservatives would expect to see a world where people form co-operatives to provide the services the government used to, but in a voluntary manner.  And what exactly would the advantage of that be? Do you think a small cooperative would have been able to run and finance the Apollo program for example?  What I fail to understand with many (at least loudmouth) small Government types is what exactly it is they hope to get. Sure, they yell about taxes and intrusive Government, but by and large that doesn't really seem to be a big problem. We do have transgression but we also deal with it.  Most of their arguments are advanced on an emotional level (The Government is stealing from you by taking taxes) etc. and not any rational arguments.  I am sure there are a few good examples where a smaller Government would make sense or where the Government reduces it's influence, but that's not the current ""Small Government‚Ñ¢"" brand message.   I would rather prefer people would take a more active role in the Democracies they live in, that is, do more than just select some schmuck every few years and feeling good about having done their ""duty"" while bitching the rest of the time.",‚Ñ¢

t5_2qh33,fAuxlRose,1340509713,"Text from this asshole my girlfriend found on the interweb:  I love girls. Unless of course, the girl lets it slip that she's under 18 years of age. In that case, I am legally obligated not to pump her full of my glorious semen. Also, I don't love fat chicks. Oh, or ugly chicks. But I absolutely love girls who are thin, pretty, and willing to lie to me about their age. I love everything about pretty girls: their curves, their hair, their smell, their warm inviting holes, even their skin. And when genetics or a highly skilled team of plastic surgeons give a girl a perfect body, I hate to see her desecrate it. Girls do all sorts of stupid shit to their bodies. And while fake tans and too many piercings piss me off just as much, this rant is dedicated to tattoos. Tattoos are a badass form of personal expression if you're some fat biker guy or some wannabe rockstar, but when you're a chick with killer tits, the last thing you should do is put a big ugly tattoo on those tits. I don't believe the female form should be tampered with at all, but there are five places in particular where a girl should NEVER get a tattoo:  1. Back of the neck There's only two tattoos that you can get on the back of your neck: a butterfly or a gay ass Japanese kanji symbol. Why the hell would you want a tattoo on the back of your neck anyway? There's only two ways that people will ever see you neck tattoo. One is if you have a dyke haircut, the other is if you have your hair up for a formal occasion. And when you're at a fancy ass wedding in a $300 bridesmaid dress, the last you want is a visible tattoo. The only thing that I want to see on the back of a girl's head is a handle. That way, I can force her to deepthroat when she's sucking me off. That, or maybe an on/off switch like Vicki on Small Wonder.  2. Ankle As far as I can tell, the only reason that a girl decides to get a tattoo on her ankle is so she can say that she has a tattoo. An ankle tattoo is usually small and pointless, much like the female ankle itself. No one is going to look at your goddamn ankle, especially if you're wearing those knee-high boots that I like so much. No one is going to fucking notice it unless you specifically point it out. And once you do, no one is going to care. Congratulations, you just wasted $50, you stupid whore.  3. One or both breasts Woman is a highly flawed being. Some of these flaws include menstruation, menopause, and extremely painful childbirth. However, God did get one thing right when he created women: breasts. Breasts are perfect. Big breasts, small breasts, fake breasts, it doesn't matter. Those round balls of fatty tissue are an exemplar of beauty. DON'T FUCK WITH THEM.  4. The lower back Don't get me wrong, lower back tattoos can be kinda hot. However, I can't respect a girl with a lower back tattoo. I'd fuck her a few times, buy her a couple of dinners, and probably even return some of her calls. But that's as far as it would go. You don't enter into a serious relationship with a girl with a lower back tattoo. You can't. After you've banged her on every surface in your apartment, you begin to realize that she's still going to have that tattoo when she's 40. If you don't end the relationship soon, someday she's going to be taking your kids to the beach in a two-piece bikini and sooner or later, your kids are going to see that tattoo and they'll start to suspect that their mommy used to be a complete whore. And they'll be right. And then you'll realize you married a total skank, one with a tattoo that doesn't look anywhere near as hot as it did twenty years ago.  And that's when you decide to lose her number and change the locks.  5. Ass cheek What the fuck is up with ass tattoos? What were you thinking, bitch? Did you think that maybe I needed something interesting to look at when I fuck you doggystyle? Sorry babe, but when we fuck doggystyle, I'm looking at the TV, not your stupid rose tattoo. SportsCenter trumps a girl's ass every goddamn time.   Girls with tattoos are 965,406 times more likely to give you an STD than ones without.  haddox@sydlexia.com  Back to how much I rule...  ¬© 2006 by Haddox",¬©

t5_2qh1e,The_Adventurist,1340522259,"To be fair, that's the worst of our comedy TV that you mentioned. In America, we only get the best British TV, so we think it's all superior, but when you actually watch normal British sitcoms, a lot of them are just as shitty; full of catch phrases and ""carry on"" puns and obvious gay jokes. It's exactly the same as Two and a Half Men, but with slightly worse production values.  However, British ""reality TV"" does seem to be much better than anything in America. If you compare the American and British versions of The Apprentice, you get a nice contrast of the big differences between the two.  The Apprentice UK is centered around a philanthropic millionaire who has a genuine passion for teaching people the fundamentals of trade and inspiring people to start their own small businesses. The production is well crafted, likely shot on film, with well-planned establishing shots and sweeps. Each task is based around a certain, basic aspect of running a business; face to face selling, managing inventory while reinvesting in stock, marketing, development of new products, etc. Those who are legitimately terrible in the competitions are thrown out early to make it a more serious competition by the finale, where it really does become a test of skills and values.  The Apprentice in America is shot on video, fairly disposable establishing shots where not much thought is put into composition and value, surely much of it is also recycled from past seasons. Each task has nothing to to with a real business and is more centered around an international corporation hijacking the show as one long commercial (i.e. the candidates have to open a mobile print studio with Kodak's brand new amazing True-Life-Color-Fun-Family-Times‚Ñ¢ digital printer!). Those who cause the most drama and are the obvious ""villains"" are kept until the finale, so it becomes a heavy handed morality tale where the ""good"" candidate must have a show down with the awful candidate and, surprise, the good candidate always wins. Trump has little interest in demonstrating anything about business fundamentals, which isn't surprising since he's not very good at business and has never had to work from the ground up.  Then you've got Top Gear vs Mythbusters, both are reality-esque and both rely on staged events and exchanges for comedic value. The difference is that Top Gear makes their exchanges feel pretty real and have the same look as a high end Hollywood film and Mythbusters is all about getting the point across, even if it is sloppy and ugly to look at. They don't put much thought into their witty banter and even less thought into how they film the stunts (aside from highspeed footage, that is) they're attempting, banking on the stunt itself to be entertaining enough.",‚Ñ¢

t5_2qh1a,aim2free,1340544355,"&gt; The pitchfork seller doesn't love freedom.  This is a highly ambiguous statement. Who is this ""pitchfork seller""?  Long time ago, most farmers were able to manufacture such pitchforks on their own (I can make them, as I'm en engineer and know pitchfork theory and the design is hardly a secret).  In the close future anyone with a good pitchfork specification would be able to hand such a task to their 3D printer, or to the local convenience manufacturer, or somewhat later just print them out in their own matter compiler (nanotech).  Today there are some entities that design such pitchforks according the principle [‚Äúany color that he/she wants so long as it is black‚Äù](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Model_T#Colors).  However, these pitchfork designers often want to preserve the pitchfork recipe a secret or try to monopolize the pitchfork design by e.g. patents.  But..., those who manufacture and actually sell these pitchforks, they just want to produce OEM pitchforks, to satisfy their customers, usually the entity which has monopolized a certain pitchfork design and have hired a pitchfork designer as a slave.  So... who is this pitchfork seller, you speak about?  I would say that the slave, i.e. pitchfork designer, can become much much more happy, when designing crowd sourced pitchforks.  We intend to make all these pitchfork designers, currently being employed by pitchfork monopolizers as slaves, happier and more pleased with themselves, as well as richer in many ways.

Causes are sufficient conditions, but not necessary conditions. Likewise, they don't always actualize their consequents. For instance, my hitting a ball with a baseball bat can be a cause of it's flying into the air, but if I hit it again, it might easily be that I make a poor shot and the ball weakly nudges off the bat onto the ground.

No one knew how good pippen was gonna be even in 88-90. Go check his numbers. He was decent but not amazing from 87-90 ( the years that jordan got beat by the pistons specifically). (http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/p/pippesc01.html)  But to say Lebron had no talent in Clevland is a joke. Jamison, west and Bigz were great pieces to utilize lebrons talents. They were all brought in specifically to help lebron.  When lebron begged for shooters they gave him shooters ( williams) When lebron begged for a man in the middle they got him shaq. Parker Drew Gooden Larry Hughes were other pieces for lebrons team. These were decent to above average guys. Same kinda guys Jordan had.  If you compare the Point averages for the 91 bulls vs the 2010 cavs its not much different ( jordan 31.5 Pippen 17.8 and grand 12.8 cartwright 9.6 to Lebrons 29.7 Jamisons 15.8 Williams 15.8 and shaqs 12.0)  Check out the 2009 numbers for the team PTS/G: 100.3 (13th of 30) ‚ñ™ Opp PTS/G: 91.4 (1st of 30) compared to Jordans 91 bulls PTS/G: 110.0 (7th of 27) ‚ñ™ Opp PTS/G: 101.0 (4th of 27)  To call a team that finishes 50-32 50-32 45-37 66-16 and 61-21 in the span of 5 years talentless is hogwash and you know it. They reached the finals and conference semis just to see Lebron fade in big games (2010 series vs boston ring any bells? yeah thought so).  This team was built around a superstar who couldnt perform in the postseason.  (btw i know youll bring up shaqs age (he was 37-38 his year with the cavs) but just remember that Kareem was 41 when he won his last title. He was able to prolong his career because he didnt have to be the man, the same situation  they brought in shaq to be (also kareem was the 4th leading scorer on that team, a severely diminished but nonetheless effective role, similar to shaqs role with lebrons cavs.))",‚ñ™

t5_2t9dp,SuredeathHellman,1340595571,"Fascism is an economic doctrine, I cannot agree with fascism because even if it is small it is still the merging if state/corporate power.  National Socialism is reform which takes shape depending on it's root. American ones like me, believe in the US Constitution, we don't think it's obsolete, and we don't think that turbulent times is justification to suspend our rights.   Economically, it doesn't mean anything. It shouldn't mean anything though. No more grandfathering in wealth in order to pass down the privilege to buy your way into politician approval to the top. (A liquor license in Florida, $250,000 and up, no joke, who the hell has $250,000?)  It wouldn't take much to get the economy going again. Not to sound like a smart ass, but if we stopped going on adventures in babysitting¬Æ around the world, all worry about social security and all other benefits for those dependents would vanish.   This isn't isolationism, it's following the constitution, we can still travel and trade with each other. (To counter the neo-con argument).   The recovery of America, will not happen in a matter of days, there will be a recovery period. Charity would bring us through though, in more than a few ways. Dr. Paul said during a debate, he used to work at a charity hospital for nothing, but in the end he got work experience as a result.   If we weren't in a stranglehold of gov't regulations, medical students could get right on that immediately, without having to worry about people getting free/ultra cheap healthcare suing them. Then our students could get work experience and get out of that catch 22 of never finding work because they have no work history.   My views relate to Hitler in that I have sympathy for his foreign policy. I don't want this country to speak German, and I don't want a Fuhrer/Reichstag system of government, or even the Chancellor/President/Reichstag system Hitler was going to remake after his retirement. Hypothetical retirement anyway, he lost the war and Germany was destroyed.   He planned on holding a world fair, abolishing the Fuhrer position forever, and re-splitting the powers between a Chancellor/President again which was the old German way. The Enabling act powers which were voted on every 4 years, were emergency powers in what we view as the ""crusade"" against the Comintern. (Western Judeo-Capitalism, Eastern Bolshevism)  Very detailed and profound thoughts on [Japanese National Socialism](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_7kkxMmBQg)   African Nationalism by [Louis Farrakhan](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWMKjW6Va78)   Sorry to be like this with video links, but we are so different, however it is our difference which unites us and transcends forever what anyone would call hateful racism. It matters not what color any of these men are. The more they love their heritage and culture, the more we can get along and see eye to eye.   I think the best solution to the modern American economy, can be found in Fordism, even Hitler knew this, he had a portrait of Henry Ford in his offices. Things like profit sharing.   I guess uniting the employee and the employer...goes something like this.   """"They must learn to respect each other and be respected again ‚Äì the intellectual must respect the manual labourer and vice versa. Neither can exist without the other"" - Adolf Hitler - written while in prison - 1924  We can't all be workers, some men rise above others through merit, achievement, innovation, invention, leadership, skill, talent, whatever makes them aces of their craft.   Class, is an interesting word. Here's a bit from Adolf in Munich April 12, 1922  ""THERE ARE NO SUCH THINGS AS CLASSES: THEY CANNOT BE. Class means caste and caste means race. If there are castes in India, well and good; there it is possible, for there there were formerly Aryans and dark aborigines. So it was in Egypt and in Rome. But with us in Germany where everyone who is a German at all has the same blood, has the same eyes, and speaks the same language, here there can be no class, here there can be only a single people and beyond that nothing else. Certainly we recognize, just as anyone must recognize, that there are different 'occupations' and 'professions' [St√§nde]-there is the Stand of the watchmakers, the Stand of the common laborers, the Stand of the painters or technicians, the Stand of the engineers, officials, etc. St√§nde there can be. But in the struggles which these St√§nde have amongst themselves for the equalization of their economic conditions, the conflict and the division must never be so great as to sunder the ties of race. ""  The void of materialism, is filled with the sense of nationalism. Eventually the selfish man instead of being idolized in movies like ""Wall Street"", is shamed out of existence. Instead, honorable men become role models.    However, all of this is based on the recognition of forced integration as a fraud, and respecting our culture/borders again.   Take care till next time. Hopefully I answered all your points if I didn't I'll recap. The description on the refusal to change the underlying system and go back to capitalism would be great. From what I've understood, Mao, Che, Castro, all trained in comintern and were agents from the get-go.  ",¬Æ

So I ended up going into a lot of detail below with criticism on your site, hope you take it as helpful and not insulting, as the intention is to be helpful**  Your site is well styled although I would suggest you work on the banner alignment.  I'm not sure if you see what I see on firefox, but I would think the bottom of the nav bar with the Home icon, Wii U online, and other things should have it's bottom edge aligned with the bottom edge of the iNintendoWiiU logo.  I would think the four images that show their title when you mouse over them shouldn't rotate without input from the user (how about hover on the left/right side?).  It seems unintuitive for it to be automatic and also not have any control to do it manually if you want.  Same with the Games section, noone could possibly read your summaries before things move, at the very least stop movement when they are moused over.  Also, who ""iNintendo"".  That's really confusing, the use of ""i"" before a name of something is pretty commonly interpreted as a mac product.  382 day old ""latest tweet""?

To remove this text, login to your WordPress admin panel and go to Appearance &gt;&gt; Widgets, and drag &amp; drop a widget into this widget panel.   I'd say clean up the details on the site, maybe work on a better name, and then after you've gotten a community, then go ahead and work on a facebook page, as it is it looks like a page random highschool kids put up for their band.  **Honestly good luck with this :)**.  Edit: Can you really put ""Copyright ¬© 2012 Nintendo Wii U"" at the bottom?  Edit 2: You have a big ""Join"" link at the bottom, and yet registration is disabled?  Edit 3:  I'm looking at this article: http://inintendowiiu.com/nintendo-wii-u-news/wii-u-will-not-have-used-game-ban/  I see 3 paragraphs of text, and two HUGE images telling me to share it, links to share it underneath that, and a floating bar to share it on the left site.  That is INCREDIBLY obnoxious and instantly will turn people off.  Seriously there are like 6 links to share on facebook.  Why would I send my friends here?  Edit4:  Looking at this article: http://inintendowiiu.com/nintendo-news/nintendos-stocks-drop-after-e3-presentation/  Work on your grammar some:  &gt; After last year‚Äôs E3 presentation we saw Nintendo‚Äôs stock plummet during and after event  ""after the event""  &gt; After last year‚Äôs E3 presentation we saw Nintendo‚Äôs stock plummet during and after event. This loss was due to consumer‚Äôs hesitation over the Nintendo Wii U which was revealed last year. This year, seems to be no better for Nintendo as the market followed a similar pattern.   Is the ""This loss"" in the second paragraph a lost that happened last year, or this year.  Saying ""this loss"" after the previous sentence implies it is ""last years loss"", but the phrase ""revealed last year"" implies it's this years loss.  &gt; While there was a lot of 3rd party support shown for the Wii U, a lack of 1st party games really seemed to bother investors.  How do you know that?  How do you know what bothered investors?  It could have been a hundred different things.  Edit 5:  Another article: http://inintendowiiu.com/wii-u-online/miiverse-wont-use-twitter-or-facebook/  &gt; Their reasoning is that there is no reason to add another device that connects to these networks when almost every device already does so. They would much rather create a new network that can branch out to be on other devices as well. In other words they are wanting their Miiverse network to branch off of the Wii U and 3DS and onto other online devices.   Have someone else read that paragraph out loud to you, someone who has preferably not read it.  It sounds so awkward and confusing, don't you agree?  Edit 6  Finally: http://inintendowiiu.com/wii-u-games/crysis-3-wii-u/  Lots of weird grammar stuff (again, try reading it out loud, I'm sure you'll get what I mean).

The guy who joins already started match is in bad position, based how long the match last until he joined. Getting new guy may be aswell disadvantage for the team with afk player in some situations. Next thing would be, the matter of closing the gap between gold/exp he would have and what he basically get. Afk player is better than feeding one, theres is possibility that new player would get more gold/exp than he would earn if he had played from biegining just because hes bad. Solution for that might be just putting new player in a bad position (from where ""average"" player would just do bad for most of the match). The idea of giving new player gold/exp from the ""normal constant"" income (who afk player would however earned) is not good, esspecialy if u are lacking role which is farm dependant.

I'd rather call them ""Mohammedan's"" because muslim means ""someone who submisses under god"" and that's not right imo, they just believe what Mohammed said, the same as Christians believe what Jesus Christ said) is the following: Aisha's age is wrong, womens age was counted when their period started so she really was 20-something. Which is bullshit, if you consider that Moe's first wife, Khadija is told to have been in her early 40's when they were married and they had children together. So if womens age was counted after they got their period, Khadija must have been 50-ish when she married Mohammed. No fuckin way they could have had children when she was that old at that time, Aisha was 9 and Moe was a sick bastard. Then comes the usually ""you can't truly understand"" etc., you know that. At that time in this region Mohammed just might have been the usual warlord and he sure was a man of his time and usually I don't jugde people who are dead for a thousand years on today's moral standards.  But the thing is, that Moe is considered as the perfect human by muslims this very day and this just frightens the shit out of me. You could just as well call Attila the Hun the ""perfect human"".  Btw. You really see Moe was sexually obsessive. It's even written in the Quran that Mohammed is allowed to have more women than any other human being in this world. Funny, isn't it? One should think the almighty Allah, Creator of everything‚Ñ¢ should have something better to say in his final message to all humanity than ""Mohammed can fuck all the bitches he wants to"".

I've seen a surprising amount of these guys in my life (maybe because I'm in the nerd-sphere, I think it happens around more timid guys) and I've seen them frequently self destruct after rejection.  Or, it could be that you're seeing motive where there is none, and they self-destruct because they don't know how take it and think once rejected, the friendship is over. Someone wanting to be friends and someone being extra nice because they are hoping for a relationship (and that *is* what most of these men want, not just a lay or 'an ulterior motive') is not 'not mutually exclusive' part I was talking about earlier.   Sorry, from what I've seen, this ""Nice Guys ‚Ñ¢"" shit usually amounts to post-hoc rationalization when a relationship goes sour, and is nothing more than a buzz word that armchair feminists can circlejerk over.

t5_2qh1e,JohnnyNoCares,1340645729,"&gt;Effects on Driving: The drug manufacturer suggests that patients receiving treatment with Marinol¬Æ (THC) **should be specifically warned not to drive until it is established that they are able to tolerate the drug and perform such tasks safely**. Epidemiology data from road traffic arrests and fatalities indicate that after alcohol, marijuana is the most frequently detected psychoactive substance among driving populations. Marijuana has been shown to impair performance on driving simulator tasks and on open and closed driving courses for up to approximately 3 hours. Decreased car handling performance, increased reaction times, impaired time and distance estimation, inability to maintain headway, lateral travel, subjective sleepiness, motor incoordination, and impaired sustained vigilance have all been reported. **Some drivers may actually be able to improve performance for brief periods by overcompensating for self-perceived impairment.** The greater the demands placed on the driver, however, the more critical the likely impairment. Marijuana may particularly impair monotonous and prolonged driving. Decision times to evaluate situations and determine appropriate responses increase. Mixing alcohol and marijuana may dramatically produce effects greater than either drug on its own. ([NHTSA](http://www.nhtsa.gov/people/injury/research/job185drugs/cannabis.htm))  Marijuana should carry a similar warning to that of any antidepressant or heavy painkiller.  To compare it directly to alcohol is misleading at best and downright wrong at worst.  While, yes, driving  under the influence of marijuana is not the best idea, it does not necessarily make you a danger to yourself and others.  The main difference between alcohol and marijuana is the inhibitory nature of alcohol that causes reckless behavior.  Anyone who claims that marijuana does not cause at least some decrease in reaction time and awareness is wrong.  That said, it is not nearly as debilitating as compared to alcohol; more so when you account for the self correcting nature of the caution induced by anxiety.  [Anecdotal](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3xJrRQHCAg) evidence shows that driving while **mildly** intoxicated by marijuana is not very debilitating.  My own personal evidence also shows the same phenomenon.  You are aware of your own distortion and compensate by concentrating on the road, your speed, and your surroundings.  That said, if you are mildly to moderately stoned, I would not recommend driving in busy, high speed, urban areas, although they are navigable it can become overwhelming and the delayed reaction of marijuana starts to become an issue (causing missed opportunities to merge, missed turns, and lots of driving around the block to get where you intended).  If you have to take back roads to get home at midnight after a smoke sesh, take a breather, sober up, and drive safe.  Like another poster said, don't drive if you're above a [6] (more or less), which is similar to people who drive after having a beer or two.  I'd be more worried about people talking on cell phones or texting while driving. ",¬Æ

t5_2qh0z,SomePostMan,1340655498,"Well-said. To put it in a different perspective:  Only a few‚Ñ¢ centuries ago, the vast majority of humanity's working hours were spent making food. Advances in agriculture were among the most important in history because only they could free up our time to do other things. (As I recall from an infographic in some book... in America, two centuries ago, it took about 2-3 farmers to feed the average family: husband, wife, and some help from the kids. As of something like 1990, those two farmers could feed about 34 people.)  We could have spent that extra time as liesure, living the same standard of living with more time off, but humanity ultimately kept working (for several reasons), to live a higher standard of living. In other words, if we all cooperated and were willing to accept the standard of living from centuries ago, thanks to modern technology, we could work very, very little on average and still be alive. (Six saturdays per week!)  Some anthropologists have taken this a step further and looked back at aboriginal tribes who don't use agriculture: they still get their food as hunter+gatherers, but no farming. One might expect this would be awfully hard, but that didn't bear out: on average, one tribe spends about 3 hours per day per person working to survive, and the rest of the time goes into liesure, games, culture, crafts, construction, etc.   With this insight, some recent philosophers have proposed the idea that agriculture was 'a step back' for humanity, and our labor, relationships, and overall quality of life have suffered since then.  Not that I agree with that, per se, or envy that lifestyle, but it just goes to show again that the 40-hours-per-week thing is a modern socio-economic construct, not anywhere near a requirement for basic living.",‚Ñ¢

t5_2tq8a,greenduch,1340676112,"This makes me sad that I missed chicago dykemarch, sounds like I would have enjoyed it.  a few things i thought would make for an interesting conversation-  &gt;The gay community, meanwhile, would simply be people who are gay, or maybe lesbian, or possibly bi, or very occasionally trans. There‚Äôs an overlap between the two, but they are not identical. Those definitions, and their differences, also begin to make sense of the gaywashing of Stonewall and of the gay rights movement, in particular the ‚Äúwe‚Äôre just like you‚Äù message of the gay marriage movement.  &gt;Assuming those definitions hold (and I‚Äôd love to hear dissenting views), what does that mean for Pride?  ...  &gt;But queer rights activism, as I‚Äôm experiencing it and hear others talk about it, isn‚Äôt quite that. We‚Äôre aiming at redefining normal, rather than coopting a vision of normality which includes the white picket fence, married couple, kids playing in the yard. We want the right to legally marry our loved ones, just like ‚Äúnormal‚Äù people are able to do, but it may be a marriage of more than two people. We want to safely express our gender, just like ‚Äúnormal‚Äù people are able to do, but that gender expression may be wildly outside the binary, or shift and change on a day-to-day basis. We want our identity to be respected, just like the respect ‚Äúnormal‚Äù people can safely expect, but that identity may not fit within any commonly understood boxes.  &gt;It‚Äôs one of the many paradoxes of queer identity: We‚Äôre just like you, but we‚Äôre not just like you.  As someone who, online at least, finds myself increasingly frustrated in the ""gay"" community, I wonder how to deal with this sort of thing. Because my beliefs and politics really don't match with the mainstream gay rhetoric, yet I try to move in (and moderate) very mainstream spaces.  I know yall are probably tired about hearing about Pride at this point, but I thought this article made some interesting points that maybe we could discuss. What do we do about the giant divide between the mainstream Gay Rights‚Ñ¢ movement and the more anti-assimilationist style? Cause, I gotta say, pushing back against some of the Gay Rights‚Ñ¢ style stuff can get kind of tiring.  What is the future of Pride? What should it be? Should we just say ""fuck it"" and participate in events that are more queer instead, leaving Pride to the cis straights and the corporations?  I find myself in this weird place of defending pride against some of the more normatively minded folks who think ""omg why can't all those gays just act *normal* instead of flaunting around!"" while at the same time being rather critical of it. Its... weird.",‚Ñ¢

I live in an area with an extremely low population of Muslims (if any?). What we know about Islam is either from the education system or through the media, and the emphasis on tolerance from both is what causes this sort of misunderstanding.   After 9/11, our schools began teaching a lot more about Islam in our religion classes. It was largely untrue (basically just promoting acceptance instead of giving facts), and kept pushing the ideas of ""Religion of Peace"" or the hippie image similar to Buddhism. Barbaric practices are associated with just being part of a different culture (*""when in Rome, do as the Romans do""*) or as being misunderstandings:  * Women in the Arab world are covered out of respect; it protects them against sand and heat, so they enjoy it and choose to do it.   * Sharia law is just a moral system  * Jihad is just a figurative term and has nothing to do with violence. It's just symbolic, etc.  * Islam is a very feminist religion that treats women even better than men. (never understood this one, but it's used a lot)  * Islam had nothing to do with 9/11 or any suicide bombings; they were just crazy people who happened to be Muslim fundamentalists.  We were never taught anything about the Quran, Islamic history, or anything that could potentially be used against Islam. I'm not saying that we were brainwashed, or that we were under some sort of Agenda; I think that the people organizing this stuff genuinely believed what was being taught. Multiculturalism should be celebrated and all that.   So, more and more over the last few years, if you criticism Islam or anything related to it, you're branded as...  * a bigot * a racist  * brainwashed  * Islamophobic (bullshit term in itself) * intolerant * ignorant/uninformed * and so on..  The heavy misunderstandings from friends of mine are evident in this as well; they heavily buy into the idea that women are only covered/limited due to the immense respect that the FeministReligionOfPeace‚Ñ¢ has for its women. I've had lots of small debates about Islam, but it only ends with the other person getting angry at my perceived narrow-minded racism toward the Muslims. The same sort of people who will label all Catholic priests as paedophiles will get all up in arms if you discriminate against the humble Islamic culture.  Then, of course, you have the people who have met Muslims; this means they can discredit anything negative said about Islam. ""My Muslim friend is gay!"" or ""My Muslim friend said that was just propaganda!"", and so fourth.    I'm assuming this is pretty much the situation with a lot of the people trying to act as a bridge toward r/Islam. They're likely ignorant, Liberally-minded young people without a clue about anything other than their secular upbringing who feel the need to act like white-knights towards the misunderstood Islamic faith.

The Taliban said Time was lying when it accused the group of slicing off 18-year-old Aisha's nose and ears after she fled her abusive in-laws in southern Uruzgan province last year.  ""This desperate propaganda by Time magazine has shown the whole world the lengths which the world media will go to please America, even at the cost of their journalistic integrity,"" a Taliban spokesman said.  Independent US monitoring agency SITE said the English-language statement from the Taliban spokesman was posted on Saturday on the website of the group, which calls itself the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan.  The statement accused the Americans of ""publishing these lies to divert attention of the people from their clear and disgraceful defeat.  ""This picture published by Time magazine and the barbaric story wrongly attached to Islamic Emirate is not only false, but publishing these images are against the morals and ethics of professional journalism,"" it said.  ""A lot of journalists worldwide have condemned this act of Time magazine and called it a crime against journalism.  ""As far as the story of Aisha is concerned, Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan has condemned this barbaric, inhumane and un-Islamic act and declares that this case has never been forwarded to any court or persons of Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan.""  The statement goes on to point out that under Islamic law the ""cutting of human ears and noses whether the human is alive or dead is illegal and prohibited.""  ""We call on Time and other Western media to stop trampling on their own moral principles, just to hide and divert people?s attention from America's military and political defeat by publishing such fabrications,"" it said.  ""We also call on Afghan media to stop spreading the lies of Islam-hating Western media by becoming their translators. Journalism is an important duty, thus it should not be used in spreading mischief.""  Aisha has become a symbol of a debate amongst commentators over the nature of the US mission in Afghanistan, with Time arguing Aisha's case demonstrates why the Taliban should never be allowed to return to power.  Aisha is soon to undergo surgery in the United States to rebuild her face.  Copyright ¬© 2012 AFP. All rights reserved. More ¬ª",¬©

t5_2t5r5,mennonitedilemma,1340733284,"    PART 1  An interesting name of an early Christian to first cite, since Tertullian is the least favourite in our College (It is mostly protestant).  This is because his writings actually are not Sola Scriptura.  He is known for claiming that those outside the visible Church shouldn't be allowed to even utilize the Scriptures for themselves, unless the Church is Apostolic.  Additionally,  my professors do not like him because he allegedly became a Montanist.  That's okay for some though, since a lot hold to the idea that there have always been a remnant true Christians and you try and consider these heretical groups to be those true Christians (off topic).  Anyway, here is the link to his actual writings that is normally quoted:   * http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf03.v.iii.i.html  I would definitely encourage you to read all of his writings.  Historians are a great resource, but sometimes they have biases which get in the way of seeing a broader picture of the person. Additionally, we even do not read all of what those historians say, and can misuse what they say.  I had to go through this book again since the last time I read it was about a year and a half ago, so sorry for the late reply. Unfortunately, I cannot read the original manuscripts (Latin) to do any kind of exegetical analysis of his writings, so I will rely on some close reading of the English translation.  And yes, you have brought the academic out of me (Maybe this is what you were hoping for) and I will begin a thorough list of evidences that he does not believe that only the Scriptures are infallible.  This is going to get long, but maybe it will be worth it and I can come back to this the next time I have to write something about him lol.   I will begin here because we see that Tertullian is beginning to deal with the topic of appealing to the Scriptures.  &gt;‚Äú**Now** this heresy of yours **does not receive certain Scriptures**; and whichever of them it does receive, it perverts by means of additions and diminutions, for the accomplishment of it own purpose; and such as it does receive, **it receives not in their entirety**,‚Äù (Tertullian, The Prescription Against Heretics, XVII; emphasis mine)  Here we see Tertullian claiming that the heretics do not accept the scriptures in their fullness.  However, look at the contrast word ‚Äúbut‚Äù immediately following this sentence,    &gt;‚Äúbut even when it does receive any up to a certain point as entire, it nevertheless perverts even these by the contrivance of diverse interpretations.‚Äù (Tertullian, The Prescription Against Heretics, XVII; emphasis mine)  This is a great saying, that heretics pervert what scriptures they have in common with the Apostolic Church by their many interpretations of the Scriptures.   This obviously is not a saying against the infallibility of the scriptures, but what we have here is the beginning of true Christians‚Ñ¢ becoming frustrated that even when using the scriptures the heretics do not conform to the catholic understanding. Instead, the heretics conjure up their own alternative interpretations.  Thus, Tertullian concludes that  &gt; ‚ÄúThough **most skilled in the Scriptures,** you will make no progress when everything which you maintain is denied on the other side‚Ä¶ . As for yourself, indeed, you will lose nothing but your breath, and gain nothing but **vexation** from their blasphemy‚Äù (Tertullian, The Prescription Against Heretics, XVII)   This is my main crux with debating all the different protestant traditions.  I waste so much of my time refuting them but as Tertullian noticed, I have nothing but vexation after completing these discussions.  * Link to this chapter: http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf03.v.iii.xvii.html      PART 1",‚Ñ¢

We have tested the DVD Rewinder with the next generation disc media including Blu-Ray¬Æ, and HD. The DVD Rewinder also works with Sony Playstation¬Æ, XBox¬Æ, and other disc based console system media. &gt; &gt;We have very few left in stock and we do not plan to continue production after 2009.   Were those actually real? DVD rewind fees?",¬Æ

t5_2t5r5,WertFig,1340748636,"&gt;He is known for claiming that those outside the visible Church shouldn't be allowed to even utilize the Scriptures for themselves, unless the Church is Apostolic.  I think many proponents of sola Scriptura would agree with that. Well, not that they're not *allowed*, per se, but they simply make mincemeat of what was intended by the authors. It's interesting to hear about his possibly becoming a Montanist, given his strong stance against Gnosticism. Granted, Montanism doesn't seem to be *explicitly* Gnostic, but they're alike in some ways.  &gt;This is a great saying, that heretics pervert what scriptures they have in common with the Apostolic Church by their many interpretations of the Scriptures.  We see this plain as day within the debate subs and the Skeptics Annotated Bible. Anti-theists, atheists and non-Christians enjoy contorting the Scriptures to say things that they weren't intended to say.  &gt;...but what we have here is the beginning of true Christians‚Ñ¢ becoming frustrated that even when using the scriptures the heretics do not conform to the catholic understanding. Instead, the heretics conjure up their own alternative interpretations.  Do you trademark ""Christians"" in sarcasm or no?  Did Tertullian believe heretics were saved? That is, were they indwelt by the Holy Spirit? Or were they no better at exegesis than any post-modernist who wishes to read meaning into the text? This matters, of course, because you can imagine eventually bringing a Christian brother around to the truth; a man who is unsaved perhaps never will.  &gt;This is my main crux with debating all the different protestant traditions. I waste so much of my time refuting them but as Tertullian noticed, I have nothing but vexation after completing these discussions.  All you've cited is Tertullian saying that Christians will become vexed at heretics for their blasphemy. I agree; I'm vexed at the ridiculousness of what some people manage to pull out of Scripture on the debate subs here on reddit. However, you cannot, from these citations, say that Protestantism is *blasphemy.*  Furthermore such a charge assumes that every Christian should have the maximal human knowledge of God at all times. If they don't, if they struggle or stumble at any part of learning, then they're sinking into *blasphemy* in which their teaches can only hope to find vexation. That's certainly not true. We increase in knowledge of God by degrees, some knowing more of this and some more of that, and we teach each other patiently.",‚Ñ¢

""Speak and argue with one another and make clear to me which is the best religion."" They began to dispute with one another without arriving at any results until the King said to the Christian priest ""What do you think? Of the religion of the Jews and the Muslims, which is to be preferred?"" The priest answered: ""The religion of the Israelites is better than that of the Muslims.""   &gt;The King then asked the kadi [a Muslim judge and scholar]: ""What do you say? Is the religion of the Israelites, or that of the Christians preferable?"" The kadi answered: ""The religion of the Israelites is preferable.""   &gt;Upon this the King said: ""If this is so, you both have admitted with your own mouths that the religion of the Israelites is better Wherefore, trusting in the mercies of God and the power of the Almighty, I choose the religion of Israel, that is, the religion of Abraham.

If you're a progressive who is feeling let down by Obama, don't feel alone.  If you're a conservative who is not enthusiastic about Romney, ditto (that term should resonate).  In either case, this decision shouldn't be too hard if you do a tiny bit of research.  Typical progressive's view:  Obama didn't come through for us on a lot of things we expected and he has continued some of Bush II's policies, but Jesus Hussein Christ, he's about 100 times better of a choice than anyone the GOP has offered, especially RMoney.  Even as a ""lesser of two evils"" vote, I'll sleep better knowing he's in office.  Plus, give the guy a break, he's faced 100% pure obstructionism from the GOP since day one (they even admitted to this being their strategy).  Typical conservative's view:  Romney may not be a true Christian and nobody in the GOP likes him, but at least he's not a black.  The blacks only want Obama because he's a black.  I swear by blue eyed, blond haired, white Jesus that Romney is a better choice because at least he is owned by people who want to keep prayer in the schools, know that abortion is more important than the economy and national security, and that the only way to save ***AMERICA!!!¬Æ*** from socialism is to elect a guy who knows how to cut taxes, and who knows that a bought and paid for electoral system is best.  ¬† ¬†    ¬† ¬†   Either way there hasn't been this clear a distinction between candidates since ever.",¬Æ

t5_2sdu8,Unrealdude,1340847563,"You picked one random game that has a lot of what-if and clashing canon plot lines for your argument? How adorable ‚ô•  The movies? Usually. Some could very well be considered canon (Bardock, History of Trunks, Fusion Reborn), while others seem like parallels to already established situations (Bojack, for example, goes a lot like the Cell finale, for example... and Tree of Might compared to the Vegeta fight.)  The games follow their own thing, as is the case with many other forms of media. Pok√©mon Adventures (manga) shares likenesses and characters with the Pok√©mon games, but they're considered separate.  The only exception I'd make to that is Dragon Ball Online, which blatantly disregards the events of Dragon Ball GT, which you disregard anyway simply, apparently, because you don't like it and was made by Toei. Even though Toriyama oversaw the production of GT, it comes down to taste, and that's not a reason to discredit a series.  So, yeah.

""We knew you'd fail-------backup was hired------eliminate them before you---------------------------or you'll be next------try harder-----------last chance-------------------------Trapped_In_Reddit will have your head."" Then there was a list of 3 names that i couldn't make out, but they all had the ¬© symbol next to their name.  Bots. Scary thought.  The note jumped around a bit, but it was clear some bots had been hired to clean up Cairo's mess. And i recognized the name. Trapped_In_Reddit was an infamous fighter pilot for the Italians in the war, i had treated a few of his victims. Rumors said he was a gargantuan man, a mountain of meat, intimidating to say the least.  Satisfied i had found all there was to find, i began searching the goon i had shot trying to recover the envelope. Apart from a pack of cigs and a picture of an ugly dame, he had nothing of interest until i found his iron. The Pistol was heavily engraved with an inscription on the cylinder.  ""A thanking gift to a helpful Nipote. This life can be difficult, but family is forever."" It read.  Nipote, italian for Nephew.  I got chills. I pulled down his shirt collar to be sure.  I was greeted by a tattoo of a black rose  I had killed the nephew of Salvador_Benezi, godfather of the Cerchio Nero, an Italian Karma Ring.  Cairo was shady, but i don't think even he knew what he was into. ",¬©

I've always enjoyed hockey by the mantra of, ""You don't choose the team, the team chooses you."" And even more importantly, a fan of **any** team should be a fan of the **sport**, first and foremost.  I was born and raised in Edmonton, as an Oilers fan. As soon as I moved to Vancouver, I was immediately asked by the locals, ""So that means you're going to be a Canucks fan now, right?"" I would reply with the above mantra and, invariably, the response that I would get was, ""Oh, you'll come around soon enough. The Oilers are awful.""  If that's what being a fan is, I need to find a new word to call myself. When you stick it through the lows, it makes the highs that much sweeter.  **However**, let's say 5 years from now the Oilers are STILL awful. Tambellini is STILL the GM, and we're STILL ignoring major organizational needs. That would be over a decade spent floating somewhere between mediocrity and complete incompetence. I would consider that a fair enough reason to jump ship (even though I personally wouldn't), and even then, I wouldn't even think about calling myself a fan of another team unless I had a reason better than, ""Oh, they're a good team.""  **TL;DR:** It's cool if your team isn't going to get any better any time soon (within like 10 years plus), and you should be able to justify your reasons for liking your new team, whether it be play style, franchise history, rivalry w/ a hated team, etc. Just not, ""They're good.""",‚Ñ¢

t5_2sn7r,highguy420,1340896481,"I'm not sure that I do understand American's compulsions for food from a logical perspective.  It seems the best explanation is that we have been trained to believe that we do not have time to eat real food.  Therefore when we are tired or high we grab a bag of chips and eat the entire thing.    I think it has more to do with monotony of flavor.  If you grab a bag of chips when you have a reduction in blood glucose your brain will surreptitiously consume every chip in the bag.  The substance simply has too little nutrition and variability in content.  Your brain demands a large portion to make up for the lack of nutrition.   Instead I try to consume ""munchie"" meals that are varied in flavor and high in nutritional value.  One example would be a plate with a salad (topped with dried cranberries, sliced walnuts, a pear-infused vinegar and home-made strawberry syrup),  a slice of butternut squash (with melted butter, salt and pepper), and some fresh strawberries with vanilla bean infused sugar to dip them in.  By the end of that plate my brain, sober or stoned, is satisfied.  And I didn't eat an entire bag of Doritos^¬Æ.    So, I get your point, we are the fattest nation in the world.  At the same time, we are, unquestionably, one of the most self-destructive and arrogant countries in the world who will fight tooth and nail to maintain our self-destructive lifestyles even when we know that such lifestyle was perpetrated upon us by corporations manipulating our perception of reality.  We would rather play along with the corporations and their promise of the ""American Dream"" while in reality we are eating ourselves to heart disease and cancer in record numbers by consuming their overly processed and nutritionally devoid feed pellets.  So, yes, I do know the urge for some delicious munchies, and sometimes that's literally a bag of Frito-Lay^¬Æ Munchies^¬Æ snack mix, but only begrudgingly.    Eating a variety of nutrition-rich, fresh foods satiates our constant hunger.  Nutrition-rich, fresh foods are expensive to mass-produce and don't keep long, so in order to foist an international supply chain on us they must first convince us to eat primarily starchy powdered components that can easily be made into a multitude of products that are stable for long-term storage and shipping.  Look at the now-defunct ""Food Guide Pyramid"".  It was General Mills'^¬Æ propaganda that made it into our elementary school education.  Ask General Mills^¬Æ how much grain you should be eating ... I bet they say ""it should be the basis of your diet"".  Not biased at all.    We are not meant to eat from the grain trough like livestock.  We are meant to eat foods we grow and cook ourselves.  This automated production of food-like products is a new invention, and  we are not designed (neither intelligently nor through evolutionary events) to run on that fuel.  It is devoid of the nutrients we need in order to repair our body.  They feed their chicken livestock and their human livestock the same grain-based diet and both populations show constant nutrition-related illnesses.  But, as long as it is profitable... ",¬Æ

The question is: how do you get word out about a F2P game without much marketing budget?  So far, clearly, the players aren't taking the bait and going to gaming forums and peppering them with posts about the game, so Uber would need to get a bit more crafty.  Traditional TV/radio advertising will not hit their demographic cleanly enough and is prohibitively expensive.  This is one thing I'd do:  I'd make costumes to parody the Next Big Thing‚Ñ¢ when it comes out.  When D3 came out, I would have had costume sets ready to parody it.  Gunner as a barbarian warrior, Gunslinger as an Amazon, Leo as a mage, that kind of thing.  Instead of weapon reskins, actually make different weapon models.  Make taunts that're jokes about looting corpses.  Make CoD parody costumes with the headset mics on backwards and helmets blinding vision.  Make football player costumes for when Madden comes out.  Most big releases are no surprise and release dates are known months in advance--plenty of time to create, build, and implement this stuff.  Make Halo-like costumes for when Halo comes out.  I think most importantly, content needs to be humorous to the point that people will want to take screencaps and post them to generic gaming forums.  People see them, think, ""OMG that's funny, what game is that from,"" investigate, and then start playing.  But Uber just isn't that creative, nor do they have their priorities in order.  When I started playing this game in invitational beta, I was so excited for a MNC with rules closer to DotA but since then I've lost a lot of faith in Uber's ability to make decisions and prioritize releases well.  The game should still be in ""open beta"" instead of ""released by accident.""  People would be so much more forgiving if they were still calling it what it is: incomplete.",‚Ñ¢

t5_2qhbp,SoleilSocrates,1340909251,"Nope I though you were... &gt;This is your approach?   It is my approach because religion is a personal belief and in this diverse world we live in we can not say someone is wrong based on a personal belief or a curtain opinion(depending on the topic)...when I can tell them they are wrong is when they phsyically or mentally harm someone because of their religion. Say if someone liked Vinalla Ice cream ( to makr it eaiser lets say Bob is the name.) that is a personal opionion/belief like Believing in religion or not...now if Bob started calling others stupid disrespecting them etc....when they were being nice or haven't done anything to offend them...he would be wrong cause you are not stupid for liking different flavour of ice cream just like you are not wrong to have a different personal belief. Now when the person acts out in violence due religion...that man and that man alone deserves to be criticize based on his actions and how religion personally affected him. But just cause that person did that it doesn't mean they all act like it...so I guess you can critize, religion on how it cause each person to react. Plus if you actually studied it...it is hard to critize history when you haven't been taught it.   &gt; Does it apply to all ideas or just religion? Are you suggesting that you refuse to criticize any religions?  Answered above!  &gt;Are you suggesting no one should ever do this ...  Depending on how a person acts because of religion yes critize them..but if they believe in it and not hurting anyone the fine it is personal believe and I am not the person to tell you what to believe and not to believe...that is and you alone. Now if we are talking about things that are facts then yeah I cab tell you are wrong cause 1+1 doesn't equal 20! Does that helped brother!  &gt;and instead we should all respectful to all religious ideas?   Religion is a personal belief and in this diverse world we live in it is foolish to think that if someone doesn't have the same interest or personal beliefs that you do that they are wrong. The only time you can tell someone they are wrong for what they personally believe is fif they physically or mentally abuse someone because of it, cause it crosses the line. Does that make sense?  &gt;I'm trying to understand if you _really_ mean what you say...  I know you are sweetheart... I am fine with questions as long as they are ask nicely! I am an Atheist as well...but I don't know how long that will last these people will grow on you!!:)Salaam!:)‚ô•  Edit: In reality I can make up my own decision about religion and what I personally think about it...but how I treat. You I think of that religion depends on how the person present himself / herself to me and others. If we all personally believed in the same thing...only our DNA would make us different...sucking the fun of learning about one and another! And seeing.g and learning about different cultures!!:)  ",‚ô•

It‚Äôs an incident one parent said started with a player‚Äôs celebration by the opposing team‚Äôs bench.  The coach‚Äôs response, allegedly, was to taunt the player every time the youth hit the ice.  Martin Tremblay has been suspended from the Vancouver Minor Hockey Association as a result, Dion DeMarco of the VMHA told the Province.   The suspension is pending a disciplinary hearing with Tremblay, who coached with the VMHA last season. It was his first year in the league, DeMarco said, but not his first year as a coach.  He inquired about coaching with the VMHA when his son was relegated to a different division of Vancouver Thunderbirds Minor Hockey Association, and all their coaching spots were filled.   DeMarco said they were in need of a coach for their 11- to 12-year-old boys, and a criminal records check as well as training from Hockey Canada was all in order. DeMarco added Tremblay‚Äôs year with VMHA was incident-free.   On Saturday, video shows Tremblay, coach of the Hornets in the UBC youth spring recreational league, tripping a 13-year-old player following a 5-4 win for his club in the handshake following the game.  ‚ÄúHe coached for us but when he was doing this, he was on his free time,‚Äù DeMarco said. ‚ÄúThis is a league run by the UBC and ultimately they‚Äôre the ones responsible for him coaching at that incident.‚Äù   One parent of the Richmond Steel, who did not want to be identified, said the incident started after the Steel player who was injured started to celebrate the opening goal.  ‚ÄúHe was celebrating and he skated by the [opposing] bench and obviously, the coach said something to him because the player then turned around and gave him the finger,‚Äù the parent said.  ‚ÄúEvery time that kid was on the ice, you could see the coach would be talking to him, trash talking him, basically,‚Äù added the parent.  ‚ÄúIt was to the point where the kid was visibly upset on the bench.‚Äù  It was the final game of an eight-game regular season with playoffs in the three-team league, which was repeatedly heated between the two clubs.  The spring league isn‚Äôt sanctioned by Hockey Canada and UBC spokesperson Lucie McNeil said the facility doesn‚Äôt manage the coaches.  ‚ÄúWe register the teams, we keep score, we hire the referee ... but the teams are independent,‚Äù McNeil said. ‚ÄúOur opinion is that by requiring the coaches to have minor hockey league experience for this kind of recreational league, up to this point we have felt it was sufficient due diligence.‚Äù  But Hockey Canada vice-president of hockey development Paul Carson said that requirement isn‚Äôt enough to absolve the league organizers of responsibility.  ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs still a lot more that goes into creating a safe and positive environment for kids,‚Äù Carson added. ‚ÄúThe private side of the game is very different.‚Äù  Carson declined to comment on the possibility of assault charges to Tremblay. DeMarco, however, was clear that the punishment needs to be firm.  ‚ÄúThere has to be a strong message,‚Äù DeMarco said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the adult, you‚Äôre the one who has to maintain your cool.  ‚ÄúI have three kids of my own, I don‚Äôt want another adult touching my kid.‚Äù  ‚Äî With files from Stephanie Ip    jgreen@theprovince.com  twitter.com/jgreengo    ¬© Copyright (c)  The Province",¬©

t5_2r2jt,UtilitarianByNature,1340919492,"&gt;Actually, the main reason men get into more accidents is because of poorer judgment.  &gt;Women also pay more for disability insurance than men do.    Care to Cite?  You're obfuscating my argument. I stated it's disingenuous to cite, ""Being a Woman as a pre-existing condition"". When our insurance systems are based on RISK MANAGEMENT. Surprise surprise, genders are different and have different risks. Hence, different insurance rates.  IMO, Either everyone pays the same, or everyone pays based on their own INDIVIDUAL RISK, sex being one of those risks.  The problem is many ""feminists""‚Ñ¢ &lt;-- like Pelosi, go out there and make incredulously uninformed statements about being only negatively discriminated against while ignoring the areas where for YEARS they have been on the benefiting side of other insurances.  Our current capitalist structures incentivise Making money and as I stated below women cost more to insure because they are a larger burden on the healthcare system. Simple as that.  If you want to change the system GREAT I would agree the current one is shit, but don't stand there shouting that just you the ""poor middle class woman"" is being discriminated against and everyone else is getting a fair share.  **Edit:** I'm not complaining just for the sake of being mouthy, you have to understand your using one ideology to say, I am discriminated against because I pay more money. But then when I equally apply that logic elsewhere you want a different outcome.  I'm not even opposed to women paying less for auto-insurance I think its a good idea because statistically they cost less. It's just people rarely look at these arguments as a whole. People jump up and down for their ""victory"" at not being oppressed by health care and completely ignore the effects it might have to society as a whole not bothering to follow the ideology or idea all the way through to its logical conclusions.

t5_2qpzs,I_I_I_I_I,1340924644,"With panic attacks, the very first thing to do is remember to breathe. When I have them, it feels like I cannot breathe, but sitting down and closing my eyes and actually counting the breaths can help. This takes practice. It is basically the fear/emotion center of your brain taking over, and shutting down your frontal cortex which is responsible for rational function. Recognizing exactly what is happening in your body is very helpful as well. Take some time to research what exactly panic attacks are.  Another thing I do is immediately get a glass of water. Something about the feeling of the cool liquid wakes me up a bit. Maybe if you suck on a piece of ice it might give you the ""shock"" you seemed to need (instead of stabbing yourself).  Try to keep yourself in the moment, in right now. Anxiety lives in the past and the future. Very rarely are we in a situation where anxiety is required right then. Usually you're worried about something that's happened in the past, or something that MIGHT happen in the future. Concentrate on that idea when you're not in the panic attack. Find meaning in something, anything, and bring that up to yourself when you feel like you're going to have a panic attack. I hope this makes sense.  Edit: One last thought on panic attacks, keep an active sense of where you are with anxiety on a 1-10 scale, where 10 would be an absolute full-on panic attack and 1 is emotionally numb. You want to be somewhere around a 3 in everday life, as not to be totally numb which is also unhealthy. If you find yourself at any moment rising above a 5 or a 6, proactively take time to sit down and breathe and relax until you can lower your anxiety. Practice will help! ‚ô•  Just remember, you aren't alone. You are not worthless. You add meaning to the world. ",‚ô•

t5_2qh03,Butterlegs,1340931075,"So, let's figure this out.  e = (1+1/n)^n  As n approaches infinity, e = approx. 2.71828  Therefore, the steam summer sale would NORMALLY be in -8.8072272 days; so, 8-9 days ago. However, because we are using ValveTime^TM , we are forced to omit the number three and use valven as both its placeholder and inverse in calculation. So, I pose to you:  one, two, valven, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. We shall use alpha (Œ±) to symbolize valven. Unfortunately, even though valven is in the third slot, it cannot represent the number ""3"". That number must be entirely omitted, rather than valven simply replacing it. This is why valven must be the inverse   Next, we take the modified -Œ±.24e ValveTime‚Ñ¢ days, and compound e Œ± times, because valven&gt;‚àû, but &lt;4-(‚àû-1). Then, we get e = 2.37037037... or 7.68 for the original formula.  **BUT**, notice that the value for e had 3's in it. We cannot simply replace the three with Œ±, for Œ± is the opposite of three. Therefore, we must take the inverse of the threes:  2 + (-1/3 + 7)/10 --&gt;  31/15   (I divided by 10 rather than 100 because 3 does not count as a decimal place in ValveTime^TM )  Now, I see a problem: **3**1/15  Inverse time, of course!  Œ±, as I'm sure you've noticed, is the inverse of three, but we will skip substitution.  31 = 3x10 + 1 = (in ValveTime^TM ) -(1/3)x10 + 1 = -7/3 = (-7)x(-3) = 21    So, in ValveTime^TM , 31 = 21.  Then, the ValveTime^TM equivalent of 3.24 (I won't bore you with the calculations) is approx. 0.09. 21x0.09 = 1.89 89/100 = approx 21/24  So, to conclude, The Steam Summer Sale will begin in exactly -3.24e ValveTime‚Ñ¢ days, or **one day and twenty-one hours**.

If you have no particular goals and want to spend a bunch of money to attend a group exercise class, then go for it. But like I said to begin with, it is ""one size fits all"" by nature.  For anyone who has an actual goal, even if it's just ""look better naked,"" as it very often is, they can achieve that on their own more efficiently, for a lot less money, and in many cases with a lot less risk of injury.

Although its not for an exam-assignment it was for missing punches on my timecard for this week that needed to be approved.   From: Derpington  Sent: Friday, June 29, 2012 7:10 AM To: Bossman@derpindustries.com Subject: RE: Kronos   Well I have good news and bad news. I‚Äôll give you the good news first.  The good news is that the universe is safe from attack once again. You see, it all started when I was a boy. Around the age of 5 or 6 I went to a Cubs game at Wrigley field and my parents bought a box of Cracker Jacks. What‚Äôs interesting about this is that I‚Äôm not a Cubs fan, and I don‚Äôt like Cracker Jacks. That‚Äôs a story for another time though ‚Äì another time where life is simpler and worries are less. Anyways this box of Cracker Jacks had a pair of X-Ray glasses in them. When I put them on and looked at the scoreboard it changed the words that were on the board. They said ‚ÄúYou will be the protector of your people. Stay vigilant and hone your craft.‚Äù My craft, of course, being that of universe defending. I didn‚Äôt know it at the time, but thanks to Mr. Miagi and a bottle of Cran-Apple Ocean Spray (another story altogether) I was able to develop and master these skills in my early teens.  Fast forward to this week. Well the Aliens (ever seen ‚ÄúArrival‚Äù? Those are the ones I‚Äôm talking about.) came back. I had to make multiple inter-dimensional trips to Brazil and Buenos Aires in order to perform reconnaissance and ‚Äòhomeland defense‚Äô missions. ‚ÄòHomeland defense‚Äô in this case simply meaning ‚Äòthe entire known universe is at risk‚Äô. Fortunately all of these issues to our way of life have, yet again, been diverted. This is the good news.  The bad news is that during some of my temporal multi-dimensional travel some of my Kronos punches were impacted. After punching and then traveling back in time some of my punches appear to have been lost. I do apologize for this inconvenience, but hope that you can understand why this happened. Following is a correction of punches:  6/22 ‚Äì IN @ 6:00AM 6/26 ‚Äì Lunch OUT @ 9:45AM 6/26 ‚Äì Lunch IN @ 10:45AM 6/26 ‚Äì OUT @ 3:00PM 6/27 ‚Äì OUT @ 3:00PM  I guess what I‚Äôm trying to say is ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry that I fail at Kronos. Don‚Äôt be mad, k?‚Äù I probably messed up the 6/22 and 6/27 punches but I have NO IDEA WTF HAPPENED ON 6/26. There‚Äôs no way I could have missed 3 punches on a single day. Right? Right?

On the other hand, I won't pretend that perturbation doesn't exist, and that a lot of it is unjustified.  But on the other hand, here's an example that might explain why MRA can bother people. Take, for instance, a discussion on female genital mutilation. This conversation can not go long at all before it turns into a conversation about how male genital mutilation is also prevalent, and equally awful. And that's fine as a viewpoint, and it's a discussion that can be had. But it also means that the discussion on female genital mutilation in its own right almost never happens, because it is constantly derailled by a need to compare and contrast it to the men's rights issue, which is a different conversation than people intended on having.

t5_2tcpq,greenduch,1341038712,"&gt;I'm sorry, but I disagree with this whole ""&lt;reverse -ism&gt; doesn't real"" thing. It expresses something that is fundamentally right (which is that, in a x-normative society, x-phobia doesn't happen) on a way meant to be cryptic, controversial and annoying.   Okay, thats fair. I also didn't say it that way though.   &gt;But the ""x-phobia"" word itself has a valid definition and a place, even if it is constantly misused: we don't deny words of their definition just because people aren't smart enough to use them right (if we did, ""centrifugal"" wouldn't be in the dictionary anymore)  Hm, but the issue I take here is that this is a word that was invented specifically by anti-gay bigots, out of thin air (and is almost only ever used in that context). By using it ourselves I worry that we give them validity.  &gt;Heterophobia is the hatred of straight people. Conceptually, it is a valid word, just like ""unicorn"" or ""dwarves"" or ""spaghetti"" or words that describe something that exists (or not) in the real world.  Eh, I get what you're saying there, but the issue is that its automatically placed opposite ""homophobia"", as if they are both valid concepts on equal footing.   &gt;It describes a behavior that doesn't take place on our heteronormative society. This doesn't mean that it can't happen: for example, a queer person can, on an individual level, feel and express hatred against heterosexuals.  Fair enough, but again i take issue with using in any sort of serious manner a word like ""heterophobia"" because it implies (intentionally, I'm sure, on the part of its creators) that there is some institutionalized bigotry towards straight people (yaknow, that Gay Media‚Ñ¢ and all). Yes I understand that the english language is fluid and we can make up our own words if we want to- but I do still take issue with the use of this one and ones similar to it.  Also, as I've said before, outside of the context of anti-gay bigots, its never really occurred to anyone to use the word ""heterophobia"". If a gay person is afraid of straight people, *we just say they're afraid of straight people*. Because, despite what some basic dictionary definition might say, terms like ""homophobia"" carry with them the context of institutionalized bigotry or at least a certain power dynamic, that, as you've mentioned, doesn't exist in our heteronormative society for concepts like ""heterophobia"".  hm, my RES live preview isnt working for some reason, so I'm having trouble reviewing this comment. Hopefully it doesnt come out too jumbled.",‚Ñ¢

Lets put them in RAID 6. 4x Segate 3TB in RAID 1 (2 pairs) We end up with 2 3TB drives.  We are also going to get one of the fastest SSDs on the earth. OCZ Velodrive 1.2TB PCI-E SSD  I am going to have the Velodrive as a boot drive because of ludicrous speed and run applications off SSDs then maybe dedicate  I am probably going to dedicate both of the RAID 1 HDDs to seperate VMs of may be Arch because I haven't tried out Arch.

I know Skype isn't that much of a resource hog.  For the peripherals I would buy a flip load of screens (as much as possible). I would like to try a Daskeyboard Ultimate (I use a Razer Black Widow) and I would like to have my family member's headphones.  A C01U microphone would be nice.  I would probably get a new desk.

t5_2qh2p,JasonMacker,1341085492,"**Who speaks for the West?**: Muslims around the world do not see the West as monolithic. They criticize or celebrate countries based on their politics, not based on their culture or religion.  **Dream jobs**: When asked to describe their dreams for the future, Muslims don't mention fighting in a jihad, but rather getting a better job.  **Radical rejection**: Muslims and Americans are equally likely to reject attacks on civilians as morally unjustified.  **Religious moderates**: Those who condone acts of terrorism are a minority and are no more likely to be religious than the rest of the population.  **Admiration of the West**: What Muslims around the world say they most admire about the West is its technology and its democracy ‚Äî the same two top responses given by Americans when asked the same question.  **Critique of the West**: What Muslims around the world say they least admire about the West is its perceived moral decay and breakdown of traditional values ‚Äî the same responses given by Americans when posed the same question.  **Gender justice**: Muslim women want equal rights and religion in their societies.  **R.E.S.P.E.C.T.**: Muslims around the world say that the one thing the West can do to improve relations with their societies is to moderate their views toward Muslims and respect Islam.  **Clerics and constitutions**: The majority of those surveyed want religious leaders to have no direct role in crafting a constitution, yet favor religious law as a source of legislation.  http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=87860378  Methodology: *Gallup conducted tens of thousands of hour-long, face-to-face interviews with residents of more than 35 nations that are predominantly Muslim or have substantial Muslim populations. The sample represents residents young and old, educated and illiterate, female and male, and from urban and rural settings. With the random sampling method that Gallup used, results are statistically valid within a plus or minus 3-point margin of error. In totality, we surveyed a sample representing more than 90% of the world's 1.3 billion Muslims, making this the largest, most comprehensive study of contemporary Muslims ever done.*  **Excerpted from Who Speaks for Islam?: What a Billion Muslims Think by John Esposito and Dalia Mogahed, ¬©2008 Gallup Press.

I got the matte screen and I enjoy it, it makes it easier to keep the screen brightness down because overhead lights don't cast much glare on the screen. I also chose to remove all the branding, there's nothing on it at all except the serial number and my windows 7 information on the bottom. It's a very classy-looking machine, in my opinion. Would fit into an office or class environment without being ostentatious.  Performance-wise, it's been absolutely great. The only times I have issues are the times I forget to turn the dedicated video card on and I try to open up Skyrim/Diablo. Skyrim runs really beautifully on it, IMO.
