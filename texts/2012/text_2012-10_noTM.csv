t5_2qhfg,bowei006,1349055741,1M version is no match for two desktop versions in Crossfire (✌ﾟ∀ﾟ)☞ Haha  But I honestly don't know what the guy below is saying when he says that Crysis and Saints Row won't run fine or there just isn't enough. Where is the benchmark proof? The 6770M from benchmarks can run all those games on medium or above general settings with an 720P or above resolution from the looks of it.   And then the 660Ti and 670? Those are $300-$400 cards not including the PSU that may need to be upgraded.  Crysis 1 will run pretty well. Crysis 2 and 3......you may want to play on low with native resolution.  ,✌

Take the peanut butter sandwich, a seemingly innocent example a teacher used in a lesson last school year.  “What about Somali or Hispanic students, who might not eat sandwiches?” says Gutierrez, principal at Harvey Scott K-8 School, a diverse school of 500 students in Northeast Portland’s Cully neighborhood.  “Another way would be to say: ‘Americans eat peanut butter and jelly, do you have anything like that?’ Let them tell you. Maybe they eat torta. Or pita.”  Guitierrez, along with all of Portland Public Schools’ principals, will start the new school year off this week by drilling in on the language of “Courageous Conversations,” the district-wide equity training being implemented in every building in phases during the past few years.  Through intensive staff trainings, frequent staff meetings, classroom observations and other initiatives, the premise is that if educators can understand their own “white privilege,” then they can change their teaching practices to boost minority students’ performance.  Last Wednesday, the first day of the school year for staff, for example, the first item of business for teachers at Scott School was to have a Courageous Conversation — to examine a news article and discuss the “white privilege” it conveys.  Most of the staff are on board, but there is some opposition to a drum class being offered to middle school boys of color at Scott School.  Fifty percent of the students at Scott are Hispanic; another 15 percent are black and 9 percent are Asian. Eighty-five percent are eligible for free or reduced-price meals.  Chuck Barber, who also offers boys’ drum corps at Vernon and Faubion schools in Northeast Portland, approached Gutierrez last year to start up a lunch-time drum class for black and Latino boys once a week. This year, it’ll expand to two classes a week, to accommodate new boys as well as those with experience.  At least one parent has a problem with the the class, saying it amounts to “blatant discrimination and equity of women, Asians, whites and Native Americans.”  “This ‘club’ was approved by the administration, and any girls who complained were brushed off and it was not addressed,” the parent wrote anonymously.  Gutierrez denies that any students were turned away from the drum corps, and vehemently rejects any suggestion that it is discrimination to offer a club catering to minority boys.  “When white people do it, it is not a problem, but if it’s for kids of color, then it’s a problem?” says Gutierrez, 40, an El Paso, Texas, native whose parents were Mexican immigrants. “Break it down for me. That’s your white privilege, and your whiteness.”   Like many if not all of PPS’ leaders, Gutierrez has gone through California-based consultant Glenn Singleton’s “Coaching for Educational Equity,” a weeklong seminar on race and how it affects life; she’s also become an “affiliate,” certified to teach the equity curriculum; and she serves on the district’s administrative committee to address systematic racism, a group that meets every other week.  “Our focus school and our Superintendent’s mandate that we improve education for students of color, particularly Black and Brown boys, will provide us with many opportunities to use the protocols of Courageous Conversations in data teams, team meetings, staff meetings, and conversations amongst one another,” Guitierrez’ letter to staff reads.  Equity training aside, Scott School must teach the same number of students with fewer teachers and resources. Down five full-time positions this year, including two reading specialists, Gutierrez is trying desperately do more with less.  “My first year as principal, I looked at the data and found that the eighth-graders that year, a third of them were going to Madison (High School) at about a third-grade level,” she told the Tribune. “I said, ‘This is completely unacceptable.’ “  That led to her adopting what she calls the school’s “Big Hairy Audacious Goal”: that every student will make two years’ growth in one year’s time in reading, writing and math.  Last year, teachers set out to tackle that goal, meeting in teams to look at data and coming up with creative ways to target their instruction.  “We want to teach them to be critical thinkers,” Gutierrez says.  The results, by the end of the year, were promising, she says. The biggest achievement was among the kindergarteners: All but three of the 63 students met their benchmarks at the end of the year.  Among the other grades, there was “tremendous growth in pockets,” she says. “Now we need to make it happen school wide.”  Despite that year of work, Oregon’s Department of Education just last month identified Scott as a “focus school,” one that performs among the state’s lowest 15 percent.  Five other PPS schools are state-designated focus schools as well: Jefferson High; CÃ©sar ChÃ¡vez K-8; and Rigler, Whitman and Woodmere elementary schools.  The designation comes with $5,000 per school and a state-appointed coach who’ll work with each school team on an improvement plan.  Another six PPS schools, which ranked among the state’s lowest 5 percent, are newly designated as “priority” schools: Madison and Roosevelt High; Ockley Green K-8; and King, Rosa Parks and Woodlawn elementary schools.  “I’m excited by the fact that we’re designated a focus school by the state,” Gutierrez says. “It’s an added layer of accountability.”  She’s so motivated to see growth that she’s adopted a new school vision: to be an “academic beacon” for Northeast Portland, where students achieve at high academic levels in two languages.  “This isn’t for the weak,” she says. “We have less resources. We can’t impact that. I want to walk away from Scott when my tenure is done and be able to say that school is achieving just as well as Alameda or Sabin, or any other school in the city. Why not?” ",©

t5_2v6m6,cherylwheeler,1349152331,"We are faced with innumerable stressors, from pressures we put on ourselves (internal) to the expectations of others (external). When we find an activity that helps us to escape these pressures we may act like “a kid in a candy store” and go overboard. Our pressures seem to disappear! And we increase the time in that magical activity that frees us from life’s pressures and provides escape.   Anything can become addictive; food, gambling, exercise, sex, spending, internet, video/computer games (for example; World of Warcraft®, Call of Duty®, and Everquest®). Whatever form of escapism, if the activity regulates mood and relieves emotional pressures and needs to be re-enacted time and time again – then the behavior has become addictive. Addiction and its behaviors become a routine way of coping, as in the cycle of addiction. Once a behavior has become addictive the pattern or cycle is predictable.   Understanding the Cycle of Addiction  1)	Stressor - such as unrealistic expectations from others or ourselves, fear of rejection/failure, life pressures, etc. Anything that triggers us to feeling vulnerable and weakening our reserve. 2)	Acting out - internet activity of any kind that segregates us from the outside world (family, work, school, responsibilities) and has escalated to more and more time away from others and our responsibilities. 3)	Guilt &amp; Remorse – this always occurs, promising ourselves or others that we will never “do it” again. Momentarily recognizing the damage. The questions of why begin to take over. 4)	Shame &amp; Depression – along with recognition, a deep sense of shame and depression.  5)	Recommitment – promise to limit time on internet, spend more time with family, recommitment to ourselves and others.   6)	Performance – we may be able to keep the commitment and promises, but only until the cycle starts up at the next stressor, which activates the entire cycle, ultimately repeating addictive cycle over and over.  Learning how the addiction cycle works, and how to replace the self-medicating addictive behavior with healthy coping skills are among the treatment protocol.

Internet Addiction Test  The Internet Addiction Test is the first validated and reliable measure of addictive use of the Internet. Developed by Dr. Kimberly Young, the IAT is a 20-item questionnaire that measures mild, moderate, and severe levels of Internet Addiction. To assess your level of addiction, answer the following questions using this scale (add your score as you go):  1 = Rarely. 2 = Occasionally. 3 = Frequently. 4 = Often. 5 = Always.  1.	How often do you find that you stay on-line longer than you intended? 2.	How often do you neglect household chores to spend more time on-line? 3.	How often do you prefer the excitement of the Internet to intimacy with your partner? 4.	How often do you form new relationships with fellow on-line users? 5.	How often do others in your life complain to you about the amount of time you spend on-line? 6.	How often do your grades or school work suffers because of the amount of time you spend on-line? 7.	How often do you check your e-mail before something else that you need to do? 8.	How often does your job performance or productivity suffer because of the Internet? 9.	How often do you become defensive or secretive when anyone asks you what you do on-line? 10.	How often do you find yourself anticipating when you will go on-line again? 11.	How often do you fear that life without the Internet would be boring, empty, and joyless? 12.	How often do you snap, yell, or act annoyed if someone bothers you while you are on-line? 13.	How often do you lose sleep due to late-night log-ins? 14.	How often do you feel preoccupied with the Internet when off-line, or fantasize about being on-line? 15.	How often do you feel preoccupied with the Internet when off-line, or fantasize about being on-line? 16.	How often do you find yourself saying ""just a few more minutes"" when on-line? 17.	How often do you try to cut down the amount of time you spend on-line and fail? 18.	How often do you try to hide how long you've been on-line? 19.	How often do you choose to spend more time on-line over going out with others? 20.	How often do you feel depressed, moody, or nervous when you are off-line, which goes away once you are back on-line?  20 - 49 points: You are an average on-line user. You may surf the Web a bit too long at times, but you have control over your usage.  50 -79 points: You are experiencing occasional or frequent problems because of the Internet. You should consider their full impact on your life.  80 - 100 points: Your Internet usage is causing significant problems in your life. You should evaluate the impact of the Internet on your life and address the problems directly caused by your Internet usage.

t5_2qqjc,redditopus,1349209833,"The counterpoint, by two psychologists: http://escholar.salve.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1016&amp;context=jift  In particular:  &gt;Mathematical and scientific abilities have been assessed with a range of measures, including standardized tests, cognitive tasks, and performance in school. The central measure of advanced mathematical skills in the United States is the mathematical scale of the SAT (SAT-M). Halpern, Wai, and Saw (2005) note that males outperform females on the SAT-M by about 40 points and the difference in scores has remained stable over the last 25 years. This supposedly intractable gap provides key evidence for claims of inherent sex differences in abilities. But is the gap universal? International assessments have provided valuable data on whether the sex difference observed in the United States is present in other countries. The Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) assesses literacy, mathematics, and problem-solving in 15-year-olds every three years (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, OECD, 2004). In its 2003 assessment of 250,000 students from 41 countries, males scored higher than females in mathematical tests in 27 countries out of 40. In one country, Iceland, girls outperformed boys; indeed, girls in Iceland even outperformed boys in the U.S. Furthermore, the results for problem-solving tests indicated very few sex differences and, when present, they favored girls.  &gt;Therefore, it appears that a male advantage in mathematics and problem-solving is not universal and varies greatly across countries. Based on these findings, the report concludes that “The wide variation in gender gaps among countries suggests that the current differences are not the inevitable outcomes of differences between young males and females and that effective policies and practices can overcome what were long taken to be the inevitable outcomes of differences between males and females in interests, learning styles and, even, in underlying capacities [italics added]” (OECD, 2004, p. 97). Furthermore, in contrast to standardized measures, females tend to have better grades than males in all subjects, including advanced mathematical courses (Kimball, 1989). Indeed, research has shown that the SAT-M scores underpredict the performance of females relative to males in college mathematical courses, both introductory and advanced (Chipman, 2005). For example, Wainer &amp; Steinberg (1992) found that females who received the same grades as males in the same university math courses had received scores nearly 50 points lower on the SAT exam.  &gt;Thus, the data demonstrate that a male advantage in mathematics is not a solid finding, with different measures yielding different outcomes. Therefore, it is not clear that sex differences in standardized test scores indicate differences in aptitude. Indeed, the creators of the SAT exam themselves are mystified about exactly what the SAT measures. When it first debuted in 1901, SAT stood for Scholastic Achievement Test. In 1941, it was renamed by the College Board as the Scholastic Aptitude Test. In 1990, when “faced with the fact that a test that can be very successfully prepared for is not a true test of ability” (PrepMe© 2001-2005, History of SAT), the SAT was renamed the Scholastic Assessment Test. Finally, in 1994, since ‘assessment test’ is redundant, the test became simply the SAT. The College Board explained “Please note that SAT is not an initialism. It does not stand for anything” (PrepMe© 2001-2005, History of SAT). Given that it is not clear, even to the developers themselves, what the ‘A’ stands for, what can be said about what the test measures? Furthermore, because sex differences on standardized math tests first emerge in late adolescence (see Spelke, 2005, for a recent review), these differences can reflect the influence of a variety of experiential factors, such as academic curricula, stereotype threat, and socialization...  Regarding the fact that this study was done on infants:  &gt;As we have discussed, sex differences in math and science abilities can be due to biological and/or experiential factors: nature and nurture are always confounded. By studying very young children, experiential factors can be reduced or eliminated. Because studies indicate that even during infancy, male and female infants receive differential treatment (reviewed by Golombok &amp; Hines, 2002), the only way to identify biological sex differences is by eliminating experience entirely and focusing on newborns. There is only one study that examines sex differences in relevant behaviors in newborns (Connellan, Baron-Cohen, Wheelright, Batki, &amp; Ahluwalia, 2000), and this study has become the cornerstone of the argument for innate predispositions. According to Steven Pinker, a leading scholar on cognition and language, “Simon Baron-Cohen has given us some of the most sophisticated research on the nature and origin of sex differences in cognition” (Pinker, 2005). We therefore focus on this study, carefully examining its theoretical rationale, methodology, and conclusions in detail.   &gt;Theoretical Rationale  &gt;The theoretical rationale stems from Simon Baron-Cohen’s work on autism (Baron-Cohen, Knickmeyer, &amp; Belmonte, 2005), a condition characterized by social impairment and heightened interest in the physical world. Baron-Cohen views autism, more common in males than in females, as a manifestation of an “extreme male brain”. He further posits that, in general, male cognition reflects an emphasis on analysis and mechanical understanding – what Baron-Cohen terms ‘systemizing.’ Systemizing abilities, in turn, would provide the basis for scientific reasoning. In contrast, female cognition reflects an emphasis on social understanding -- what Baron-Cohen terms ‘empathizing.’ According to Baron-Cohen (2003; Baron-Cohen et al., 2005), these sex differences in ‘systemizing’ and ‘empathizing’ capacities stem from prenatal ‘hardwiring’ in the brain and are present at birth. Strong support for this theory would be provided by demonstrating that sex differences in these capacities do indeed begin at birth. Unfortunately, although newborns provide an opportunity to examine biological predispositions prior to experience, they are in fact very difficult to study. They drift among various states of consciousness in an unpredictable manner, going from an alert state to crying to sleeping within a very short time. Their attention spans are extremely variable (Fogel, 2001). To address some of these difficulties, standard methodologies are typically used. However, despite an existing body of research on newborn perceptual preferences, Connellan and Baron-Cohen’s newborn study does not use this methodology, or address the findings from this body of research. We next address these concerns in an in-depth critique of Connellan et al.’s (2000) study.  &gt;Methodology  &gt;Connellan et al. assume that sex differences in infants’ interest in ‘social’ versus ‘mechanical’ stimuli are precursors to future sex differences in empathizing and systemizing abilities. They therefore compared one-day-old girls’ and boys’ interest in ‘social’ versus ‘mechanical’ stimuli. The social stimulus was the real, live, face of the first author of the study, Jennifer Connellan. The mechanical stimulus was a mobile – a face-sized ball composed of various facial features that were haphazardly arranged. The stimuli were presented sequentially to infants who were tested at their mothers’ bedsides or in the neonatal nursery, lying on their backs in their cribs or held in their parents’ laps. Differences in time spent looking at the face or the mobile were considered indices of preferences.  &gt;This study is fraught with methodological problems:  &gt;1) Validity: The investigators assumed that one-day-old newborns’ preferences for faces or mobiles reflect social versus mechanical intelligence. However, it is not clear that looking at a face or a mobile does, in fact, reflect later social or mechanical abilities. Furthermore, even in newborns, it is unclear that a face represents a ‘social’ stimulus. *Recent studies suggest that newborn preferences for face patterns compared to other patterns represent a perceptual bias for top-heavy patterns, rather than preferences for faces per se (Macchi-Cassia, Turati, &amp; Simion, 2004).* Indeed, other studies indicate that newborns actually prefer looking at these kinds of patterns to looking at real faces (Simion, Macchi-Cassia, Turati, &amp; Valenza, 2001). It is not until 3 months of age that infants prefer real faces to face-like (top heavy) patterns (Turati, Valenza, Leo, &amp; Simion, 2005).  &gt;2) Confounds/lack of control: The face and mobile differed on several crucial variables. The face in fact consists of several properties. It consists of movement and expressions, and is attached to a live person who exudes warmth and odors. As all of these vary together, it is impossible to know which of these dimensions underlie any preferences for the ‘face.’ Again, it is not clear the preferences for the face can be attributed to its ‘social’ dimension. Furthermore, infants were tested in different settings. Slight changes in the settings could lead to differences in the perception of the two stimuli, making them appear more or less top heavy under different conditions. Preferences for one stimulus or the other could simply reflect these different perspectives.   &gt;3) Experimenter expectancies: A striking design flaw is that the face stimulus was that of the researcher herself. Experimenter and subject expectancies are well-documented, and require stringent controls. In this case, the researcher could unconsciously move her face or tilt her head in ways that increase its salience, which is particular problematic given that in many cases she was aware of the newborn’s sex (Edge, 2005, Simon Baron-Cohen).   &gt;4) Operational definition of the dependent variable: Curiously, the dependent variable itself was incorrectly defined. The authors report that “looking time was calculated as a proportion of total looking time” (p. 115). However, examination of the results indicates that looking time to each stimulus was actually compared to the presentation time for each. In order to interpret findings, the definition of the dependent variable must be clear and precise.   &gt;5) Statistics. Finally, we noticed a serious mistake in the number of degrees of freedom used in the statistical analysis that compared girls’ looking time to the face and mobile. It is very possible that the correct number would not have yielded significant results. Precision in statistical analyses is a fundamental component of scientific investigation. We wonder why this obvious error was overlooked in the peer review process for journal publication. These are all serious methodological problems. There are numerous investigations that adopt a standard research paradigm for investigating perceptual preferences: all infants are tested in the same, controlled setting, stimuli are presented simultaneously to control for the fragility in newborn attention span and fluidity of newborn states, and specific procedures are used to prevent parents and researchers from influencing infants’ behavior. In studies of sex differences, experimenters are blind to the sex of the infants. Finally, the dependent variable is measured more precisely – in terms of actual looking time (the difference in the amount of time that infants looked at one stimulus compared to another) rather than relative looking time. It is unclear why the only study of sex differences in perceptual preferences in newborns ignored these standard procedures.   &gt;Findings and Conclusion The only significant findings were that boys looked at the mobile more than girls did, and girls looked at the face more than they looked at the mobile. Much was made of these findings in the paper’s conclusion: the authors state that they “demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt [italics added] that these [sex] differences are in part biological in origin.” (p. 114). This is a strong claim, with serious implications. The methodological problems already provide reasonable doubt. We next show that the findings themselves are equivocal in regard to this claim. The authors conclude that “We have demonstrated that at 1 day old, human neonates demonstrate sexual dimorphism in both social and mechanical perception. Male infants show a stronger interest in mechanical objects, while female infants show a stronger interest in the face” (Connellan et al., 2000, p. 116). However, this conclusion incorporates comparisons that were not significant: Boys did not look at the mobile more than the face; they only looked at the mobile more than girls did, and girls did not look at the face more than boys did; they only looked at the face more than the mobile. The title of the paper, “Sex Differences in Human Neonatal Social Perception,” is in fact misleading, as the findings indicated no sex difference in looking time to the face. Nevertheless, these findings are misinterpreted and misstated in many different papers as evidence for newborn sex differences in social and mechanical preferences.  Baron-Cohen is not without his flaws.",©

t5_2qh5b,gnomicarchitecture,1349213008,"So, I think you misread the first argument, it has the form modus ponens, namely:  1. A→P 2. A 3. Therefore, P.   The argument was, copy pasting:  1. It is clearly false that we ought to be totally dependent on the government. 2. If 1, then socialism is false. 3. Ergo socialism is false.  Since 2 is a conditional where the antecedent is the first premise, and ""socialism is false"" is the consequent, the conclusion logically follows (because the first premise is a premise).   Your argument, however, is a good example of why denying the antecedent is a fallacy. (Just because A is false, and A→B, this doesn't imply B is false).   Although your reconstruction of argument 2 is nice as its own argument, formally speaking, I think it doesn't capture the inductive gist of the argument. What I was going for was (where i is an arbitrarily small real constant and R is the positive reals):  1. ∀x∈R (x is too small→x+i is too small) &amp; i∈R 2. ∀x∈R∀k∈R ((P(x)&amp;(P(x)→P(x+k)))→∀x∃y x&lt;y &amp; P(y) 3. ∀x (x is too small↔P(x)) (Px: x has a property).  3. ∀x∈R ((x+i)∈R) (&amp;E 1 and closure of addition)  4. Ergo ∀x∈R ∃y x&lt;y &amp; y is too small (from 1, 2, 3 and 4.)  The conclusion entails that for any income anyone makes, there is a bigger income which is too small to be acceptable (e.g. requires government handouts).   2 is technically not induction, it's a weaker sort of entailment (just gets you the same property for some number larger than n, doesn't get you the property for every n). I could have done this with n+1 and the natural numbers, but then this would have been implausible (one dollar doesn't seem small enough a jump for us to be justified in saying that *anything* that makes it true that n dollars is not enough makes it true that n+1 dollars isn't enough. I could reasonably say ""they should get 100 dollars, not 101 dollars"". I could however, not reasonably say ""they should get 100 dollars, not 100 dollars plus an arbitrarily small fraction"". So I am actually not sure how to run this argument with induction mathematically (e.g. it seems like it's not as simple as induction, but 2 is clearly true anyway).   Edit: Regarding your edit, we need only make i sufficiently small to show that any reason for giving x a handout is a reason for giving x+i a handout. Also, note that in my formal argument I switch x and i (i is the constant and x is the variable, sorry about that. I just figured it would be better to use x as a variable as that is standard).

t5_2tl1h,Blacker_Jesus,1349219923,"##Wanna kill yourself? Imagine this. You come home from school one day. You’ve had yet another horrible day. You’re just ready to give up. So you go to your room, close the door, and take out that suicide note you’ve written and rewritten over and over and over You take out those razor blades, and cut for the very last time. You grab that bottle of pills and take them all. Laying down, holding the letter to your chest, you close your eyes for the very last time. A few hours later, your little brother knocks on your door to come tell you dinners ready. You don’t answer, so he walks in. All he sees is you laying on your bed, so he thinks you’re asleep. He tells your mom this. Your mom goes to your room to wake you up. She notices something is odd. She grabs the paper in your hand and reads it. Sobbing, she tries to wake you up. She’s screaming your name. Your brother, so confused, runs to go tell Dad that “Mommy is crying and sissy won’t wake up.” Your dad runs to your room. He looks at your mom, crying, holding the letter to her chest, sitting next to your lifeless body. It hits him, what’s going on, and he screams. He screams and throws something at the wall. And then, falling to his knees, he starts to cry. Your mom crawls over to him, and they sit there, holding each other, crying. The next day at school, there’s an announcement. The principal tells everyone about your suicide. It takes a few seconds for it to sink in, and once it does, everyone goes silent. Everyone blames themselves. Your teachers think they were too hard on you. Those mean popular girls, they think of all the things they’ve said to you. That boy that used to tease you and call you names, he can’t help but hate himself for never telling you how beautiful you really are. Your ex boyfriend, the one that you told everything to, that broke up with you.. He can’t handle it. He breaks down and starts crying, and runs out of the school. Your friends? They’re sobbing too, wondering how they could never see that anything was wrong, wishing they could have helped you before it was too late. And your best friend? She’s in shock. She can’t believe it. She knew what you were going through, but she never thought it would get that bad… Bad enough for you to end it. She can’t cry, she can’t feel anything. She stands up, walks out of the classroom, and just sinks to the floor. Shaking, screaming, but no tears coming out. It’s a few days later, at your funeral. The whole town came. Everyone knew you, that girl with the bright smile and bubbly personality. The one that was always there for them, the shoulder to cry on. Lots of people talk about all the good memories they had with you, there were a lot. Everyone’s crying, your little brother still doesn’t know you killed yourself, he’s too young. Your parents just said you died. It hurts him, a lot. You were his big sister, you were supposed to always be there for him. Your best friend, she stays strong through the entire service, but as soon as they start lowering your casket into the ground, she just loses it. She cries and cries and doesn’t stop for days. It’s two years later. The whole school talks to a counselor/therapist at least once a week. Your teachers all quit their job. Those mean girls have eating disorders now. That boy that used to tease you cuts himself. Your ex boyfriend doesn’t know how to love anymore and just sleeps around with girls. Your friends all go into depression. Your best friend? She tried to kill herself. She didn’t succeed like you did, but she tried…your brother? He finally found out the truth about your death. He self harms, he cries at night, he does exactly what you did for years leading up to your suicide. Your parents? Their marriage fell apart. Your dad became a workaholic to distract himself from your death. Your mom got diagnosed with depression and just lays in bed all day. People care. You may not think so, but they do. Your choices don’t just effect you. They effect everyone. Don’t end your life, you have so much to live for. Things can’t get better if you give up.

Now you’re venturing into getting that over other people, you’re in big danger of going down a bad road you can’t come back from  **“They can't withhold sex to make you do what they want.”**  You need it that badly?  **“They can't be rude to you or else you will simply get another girl.”**  Sometimes people get snappy. That might indicate she’s having a rough time or something’s upsetting her. Instead of being focused on yourself, you should care more about what’s going on with her  (Obviously if someone is mean 24/7 for no reason and they’re abusive you shouldn’t be with them, but occasional rudeness is normal and human)  **“This has the odd benefit of making you more desirable to them.”**  Or your delusions of grandeur are making you think that.  **“Putting a girl on a pedestal is bad for everyone.”**  In an ideal world, everyone would put everyone on a pedestal. Including themselves. How can you expect to have a life-long, special relationship with someone if you don’t treat them specially?  **“I have become a much better individual through learning to get laid.”**  It sounds like you’re turning into an empty pleasurebot.  **“NOT TRUE.”**  It is by your own admission! You yourself said it becomes less significant. Look at yourself now: how differently do you feel about those women before and after you have sex with them?.    **“there are no statistics to back this up”**  The more sexual partners someone’s had in the past, the more they’re likely to have in the future and the less likely they are to develop a lasting long-term relationship.  **“a bond is something that is either strong or week depending upon how much work you and your partner put into it.”**  To do good work, you need good tools. You’re damaging your tools.  **“why should i trust you?”**  Because every single piece of data is on my side  **“has this been your personal experience or the experience of someone you know?”**  It’s a simple statistical fact that the more partners you have, the less likely you are to ever have a lasting relationship with a single person.  **“can you think of any times when this might not be true?”**  Not that I’ve seen actual research on  **“seducing isn't manipulating. i am not making anyone do what they don't want to do.”**  I said you were on the way to becoming a manipulative narcissist, it doesn’t sound like you’re quite there yet. But that’s where this road goes. You're already treating humans like means to achieve power for its own sake  **“as far as being narcissistic, yes that is probably true haha”**  This is good! Its very good you can recognize and admit that problem, just like we all have about fapping. That’s the only way we could fix our lives; we had to recognize we were, deep down, weak hedonists and fight that. You’ve done the first part of that, why not begin the second?  **“I've formed good relationships with guys who want the same thing.”**  That’s like people who cut themselves bonding over it! If they help each other to quit its good, but it sounds like you guys are just encouraging each other to make the slices deeper and deeper  **“So far, no bad has come from it. “**  You’ve hurt the ability for sex to form bonds between you and someone else.  **“you have just summed up what seduction is. it's supposed to feel natural like you are just clicking.”**  Then why do you need 49 other women and a bunch of celebrities?  **“people having been sleeping with multiple partners throughout history.”**  And its never had good results! It was only necessary in ancient times because you needed children to be able to survive. But let’s look at your examples:  **“abraham, isaac, jacob, david, solomon”**  Abraham sleeping with another woman had awful results. It screwed Hagar (the woman he slept with) and the child they had, Ishmael, over. It also screwed over Isaac because Ishmael molested him. That, of course, would cause a lot of grief for Abraham and his wife Sarah.  Isaac stayed faithful to Rebecca, there’s no record of him having sex with anybody else.   Jacob got tricked into having two wives, if you recall. He was in love with and was marrying Rachel. But, on their wedding night, Leah’s father tricked him into having sex with her. Not long after, he married Rachel. And it was an absolute disaster. Leah was miserable. Genesis 29:31 talks about how God “saw that Leah was not loved”, and in the next verse she talks about how “the LORD has seen my misery”. The next chapter is filled with the two sisters fighting, Genesis 30:1 begins with Rachel being “jealous of her sister”, and the first half is all about their feuding with each other.  David’s desire for another woman wound up with him having her husband killed, and the child he had with her dieing.  Solomon’s wives, according to 1 Kings 11, “led him astray” by “turning his heart towards other gods”. To the point that 1 Kings 11:7 says “On a hill east of Jerusalem, Solomon built a high place for Chemosh the detestable god of Moab, and for Molek the detestable god of the Ammonites.”. Molek’s followers worshipped him by sacrificing children! And he built altars to evil gods like that all around Israel.   So, in all your examples, having multiple partners was an absolute disaster. It brought nothing but misery and death.  **“…they were not punished or condemned for this…”**  Only because polygamy was sometimes necessary. In their world, you needed children to survive. Like Rachel said to Jacob in Genesis 30:1, “’Give me children, or I’ll die!’”. It was far from the ideal though.   But you, obviously, don’t need to sleep with 50 women and some celebrities to survive. So the damage is just that: pure damage with no gain  Also, you didn’t quite directly respond to my comment that “people are counting on you, validation is not worth destruction”. The number of people counting on us is so immense we don’t have single words in English to describe it. Your “ripples” are going to have an enormous effect on them all; and forever once everything gets resurrected. Is some “validation” really worth forsaking all that? You said you like having a positive impact on people, after all. You can do that without damaging anyone. Believe it or not, its been the experience of a lot of people here (including myself!) that not fapping greatly improves your social skills!  So, how about it? You don't need to have sex with 50 women. In fact, you need to not do it. So why not do the smart thing? Please♥?  ",♥

You could open a wildly successful nightclub, but you (the mod) is not responsible for it beign great, that's the people who come to your club. However the clubbers don't get an opportunity to say ""I don't like how this club is run, lets replace the owner!"" Instead they should not attened that club, and if they care enough they should start their own club. If their club is better, then people will go to it. (© *violentacrez*)  This has happened loads of times. I mod in /r/Trees, which was started because people hated /r/Marijuana. Now /r/Trees is the largest weed-focused subreddit.  Other examples enclude /r/weightroom formed from /r/fitness, /r/squaredcircle from /r/wrestling, and so forth.  Not many people make successful subreddits because growing a subreddit is genuinely hard. The mods need to put in a lot of effort to making their subreddit a good place to be and attract subscribers. Eventually, if you get big enough, you might become default. /r/Music became default about a year ago, for 5 years it wasn't default and me and the other mods put a lot of effort into trying to make it good.  I have a guide to creating a subreddit [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/raerth/comments/f2xrr/raerths_moderation_guide/) which will help you if you want to try.  Having democratically elected mods would be terrible for another reason. Imagine if you could go to a subreddit and evict the mods. /r/Atheism vastly outnumbers /r/Christianity. How would you prevent an invasion from taking over the subreddit? With groups like SRS and others on the net, there is vast potential for people to invade and evict mods if you this were allowed. Any niche subculture would be at risk.  Reddit is a place for people to create subreddits based on whatever they want. You can create your own subreddit with whatever rules you like. No one should be allowed to take that away from you if they don't agree, instead they should leave themselves and set up their own section.

t5_2qh5b,gnomicarchitecture,1349291700,"So I used classical first order logic (L_2) plus some arithmetical operators from peano arithmetic, these are fairly standard I think:  x&lt;y means x is less than y (in CFOL+PA) or if you like LessThan(x,y) for a cleaner syntax.   x=y is defined in CFOL (equals).   P(x) just means x has a property F (to be more rigorous, a mathematical property F).   x+y is just the sum of the numbers x and y, and is undefined when x and y are not real numbers (they are in this case since the domain is reals and i is a real constant).   So the argument was:  1. ∀x∈R (x is too small→x+i is too small) &amp; i∈R 2. ∀x∈R∀k∈R ((P(x)&amp;(P(x)→P(x+k)))→∀x∃y x&lt;y &amp; P(y) 3. ∀x (x is too small↔P(x)) (Px: x has a property). 4. ∀x∈R ((x+i)∈R) (&amp;E 1 and closure of addition) 5. Ergo ∀x∈R ∃y x&lt;y &amp; y is too small (from 1, 2, 3 and 4.)  Translated into literal english this would read :  1. {For all x that are an element of the positive real numbers (R), [if x is too small (as in too small an income for a person to not get government help), then x+i is too small]} *and* [i is a particular real number] 2. For all x and for all k which are in R, if x has a specific property F and x having a specific property F implies that x+k has that specific property F, then for every real number x there exists a number bigger than x (y) which has the specific property F.  3. For every x, if x is too small, then x has a specific property F (being too small is a particular property).  4. For every real number x, x+i  is also a real number. (this is from &amp; elimination on premise 1 since 1 states that i is a particular real number, and it's also from the closure of addition, which entails that a real number plus a real number is a new real number. This is not a stated premise since it's true in the language we are using [CFOL + PA]) 5. So for every real number x, there exists a y which is bigger than x and y is too small.   The conclusion again entails that no matter how large a person's income is (any real number x), there is a bigger income (y) which is still too small for the person to not get government aid.   ",↔

t5_2r9po,Acromir,1349293635,"###Traits  ##Shadow Arts (15) * 2♦ when you stealth * +1s Stealth duration  ##Acrobatics * Might (15s) on dodge * Swiftness (2s) on dodge * Vigor (10s) on heal * Healing when you spend initiative * 20 endurance returned after dodging * +10% damage when endurance isn't full  ##Trickery * Fury, Might, and Swiftness (10s) on Steal * Vigor (15s) and two boons stolen on Steal * +3 max initiative. * +1% damage per initiative  ###Weapons  ##Sword/Dagger  This is the weapon I use almost all the time. The spam attack does the exact same damage as the dagger spam attack, but it has a cripple/weakness and it's a frontal AOE. Infiltrator's Strike is the world's best stun break. It breaks stuns, moves you out of danger, and removes a condition as a bonus. It's spammable, which is unique to us. Always have a Shadow Return available. Stuns never last more than half a second on me. Flanking Strike is meh, and only gets very rare use to remove a boon.  Dancing Dagger is a great cripple, and actually does decent AoE damage. Cloak and Dagger is central to this build. I use CnD -&gt; Tactical Strike for a daze frequently. I average a 2s daze every 5-6s. This is a great deal of support for the group, and extremely powerful in PvP. CnD actually does great damage, and Tactical Strike deals slightly more than a #1 attack. Additionally, this works well with the trait that heals when you spend initiative. It heals you as if you use 5♦ (which means 300-500 health), but only costs 3♦ with the initiative return.  ##Shortbow  90% of the time I use this weapon is in a large-scale DE (or just shadowstepping to cover ground). It has great AoE and it's ranged, so it's perfect for dancing around the outside of a large fight. This is also good for the rare occasion that I have to kite something.  ###Skills  ##Hide in Shadows  I pick this as my heal almost all the time. Withdraw heals for more, but I hate having to give up my positioning. The 4s stealth is great, and the 2♦ is a bonus. I also love the condition removal, and the regen is made more powerful by my focus on boon duration.  ##Caltrops  Amazing. AoE bleeding and cripple. It's great for control, kiting, or damage. Useful in all situations.  ##Shadowy refuge  It's a great defensive and support tool. Can be used for an easy revive, or to heal your allies. It's also a great aggro control, which is something that only Thieves and Mesmers can do. All kinds of other uses, like ambushing in WvW or harvesting a node surrounded by enemies.  ##Scorpion Wire  I usually use Scorpion Wire here. It's nice to have a fast interrupt, and the pull/knockdown is a great control. I'll often immediately follow up with Cloak and Dagger, which is a near-guaranteed hit.  However, I'll replace this skill as the situation warrants. Smoke Screen, Blinding Powder, Shadowstep, Skale Venom, and Haste all find their way into this slot at one time or another.  ##Elite  Up do you. I normally go with thieve's guild, but Dagger Storm or a racial works fine too. I'm a fan of Reaper Of Grenth.  ###Gear  ##Stats  This is a power-heavy build, although I get a decent amount of crit chance/damage. I use some vit/toughness, but a big part of my defense comes from dodging, stealth, and CC so it's not that important. Condition damage is a low priority, as my main weapon set doesn't have any damaging conditions. I pick up a little bit for Caltrops and Shortbow, though.  ##Runes I go with two Runes of the Water and two Runes of the Monk. Those each give +15% boon duration, which is a huge bonus both to me solo and to my group support ability. Right now, I'm using two Runes of the Hoelbrak for my last two, which gives +20% might duration for even more might stacking.  ##Sigils I go with a Sigil of Fire, which has a chance to trigger an AoE flame blast on crit. The flame blast triggers a minimum of once a fight, and often several times. It does surprisingly high damage and is very useful. My dagger has a Sigil of Force for an easy +5% damage.  ##Food  I go with Chocolate Omnomberry Cream. +40% magic find, and +20% boon duration. For a boon-heavy build, that's all-around epic, and the MF is just a nice bonus. I'll occasionally use a heal-on-crit food if I'm having trouble staying up.  ###Play Style  ##Damage  This build does decent sustained damage, especially AoE. I get good passive damage bonuses from initiative and my endurance not being full. Additionally, I can keep up to 10 stacks of might up on myself from dodging. I get 58% fury uptime from Steal, which is great and meshes with my Sigil of Fire. My spike damage does not exist, and I'll never compare to the damage of a glass-cannon build, especially against a single target. However, I have decent sustained single-target, and strong AoE damage. My damage is more than enough for a build with so much defense, control, and support.  ##Defenses  I never get hit. If the enemy can uncross their eyes long enough to take a swing at me, I'm either in stealth or I dodge every attack. I almost instantly break every stun on me, so good luck trying to control me. This build excels against the CC/Burst noobs in PvP. Charge -&gt; Frenzy -&gt; Hundred Blades warriors get destroyed by this build. As soon as they knock me down, I break it and Shadow Return away. Then I stealth, dodge-roll towards them, and stun them for the rest of their Frenzy. Those one-trick-ponies melt if you can counter their one trick.  Defense is very active, and very fun. You go down fast if you take a lot of hits, but you can heal yourself up very well and you have all kinds of methods to keep from getting hit. You can dodge every 3s with perma-Vigor and the endurance return, and get constant healing every time you spend initiative.  ##Support  The backbone of my support is the boons I grant from Steal. In PvP (no food) that's 16s of fury and swiftness, 18s of might, 24s of vigor, and two stolen boons to everyone near me. In PvE, I get another 20% duration from foods (total of +80% boon duration!). I also get tons of control, and active aggro control or revives with stealth is awesome.  ##Mobility  The mobility this build offers is great. You can get 100% uptime with swiftness. Combine that with Infiltrator's Arrow, and I can cover ground faster than any other class/spec. Combine *that* with stealth, and I rarely die because of all my escape tools. PROTIP: If you're just covering ground, use steal on a white-name enemy. It'll give you vigor (which requires you to successfully steal, unlike the fury/might/swiftness), but won't put you in combat.  ...  That went longer than I expected, but oh well. I'm gonna bookmark this post so I can use it as copy pasta later. Too bad that GW2Skills is down; that would have saved me some time :P",♦

But if the rotor surfaces are within spec (smooth and flat, with no scores, pits, cracks, etc., uniform, and above the minimum thickness), then resurfacing or replacing is just a waste of money. Here's what the [Motorist Assurance Program (MAP) Standards of Service](http://www.monroebrakes.com/support/map-standards-of-service) says:  &gt;Friction material replacement does not require rotor reconditioning unless other justifications exist. Monroe® recomends rotor reconditioning if they exceed factory specifications in 1) lateral run-out, 2) thickness variations, 3) have a groove in excess of .060 inch.  **Edit**: Just to add to the above, resurfacing rotors unnecessarily also reduces their remaining service life, since it decreases the thickness of the rotor.   And here are [guidelines from General Motors](http://www.motor.com/magazine/pdfs/062004_04.pdf) on the topic:  &gt;Brake rotors should only be turned when one of the following rotor surface conditions exist: severe scoring with depth in excess of 1.5mm or 0.060 inch, pulsation from excessive lateral runout of more than 0.080mm or 0.003 inch, thickness variation in excess of 0.025mm or 0.001 inch or excessive corrosion on rotor braking surfaces.",®

t5_2rske,ICOrthogonal,1349368846,"My understanding is that you should get the NMR test in addition to the standard lipid profile.  That will tell you if you are Pattern B and whether or not you need to worry.    Listen to lipidologist Thomas Dayspring talk about this: http://livinlavidalowcarb.com/blog/the-llvlc-show-episode-585-lipidologist-dr-thomas-dayspring-explains-the-truth-about-cholesterol   Peter Attia also [recommends](http://eatingacademy.com/nutrition/what-is-cholesterol) not wasting time with a VAP. Go right for the NMR:   &gt; NMR is the gold standard and more valuable than VAP. The reason is that only NMR can “count” the number of LDL particles which is actually what matters (rather than just the amount of cholesterol they hold). Cost is a function of insurance, typically.  Description of NMR from privateMDlabs.com (a service which appears to allow you to get a test ordered and completed without going through your doctor or insurance): &gt; The NMR LipoProfile® test uses NMR spectroscopy to measure the actual number of atherogenic LDL particles that build up in the arteries causing heart disease. By knowing how many of these particles are circulating in the blood, a physician can get a more accurate picture of a patient's heart health and, therefore make better patient care decisions. &gt;  &gt; Without the technology available through the NMR LipoProfile® test, Physicians merely estimate the number of particles by measuring the cholesterol they contain—known as LDL cholesterol (or LDL-C). Patients with a high number of LDL particles (LDL-P) are at increased risk for heart disease, even if they have ""normal"" LDL cholesterol levels.",®

t5_2tbbg,fairbianca,1349369848,"ita with the comments here about poking around a bit on here and also for sure about OCM - I also use oil to remove makeup and it is extremely effective as well as being good for your skin.  I use a different oil, but you can experiment around and find what works best for you.  I am personally suspicious about your scrub - honestly a mechanical exfoliant like that every day is probably quite a bit for your skin to handle (especially if you are using something with crushed seeds or *shudders* walnut hulls).  I would recommend a muslin cloth or a high quality face brush (Shiseido Cleansing Massage Brush is nice, and I ♥ my Clarisonic with the delicate head) with a moisturizing, soap-free cleanser such as Cetaphil Cleansing Lotion (my personal favorite is pricey but worth it - Carita Lagoon Water Gelee).  I would follow this with a lotion or emulsion (by lotion I mean a moisturizing water).  Again my personal favorite is pricey (Carita Lagoon Water Lotion) but you could also try rosewater mixed with a lightweight moisturizer (such as Cetaphil Moisturizing Lotion) so that it won't be too much on your skin.  I would also strongly recommend a sunscreen, but the kind that are the most effective (as well as cosmetically elegant) are going to be a bit more pricey.  You could try Shiseido SPF60+ Lotion (goes around $40 for a bottle but it lasts a long time), or if you want something even lighter weight (feels like you're seriously not wearing anything at all) go on ebay and find Biore UV Watery Essence SPF50.  It ends up being around the same as the Shiseido.  I'd say this would be a good minimum to have, and will hopefully keep your skin feeling calmer.  Hth, and good luck :)",♥

It essentially compares Stalin's Russia to fascism. This is not unknown territory to Orwell (see *Animal Farm*).   A while ago one of the mods basically called me out for saying that art should only matter as art in of itself. They argued against me saying art as intended by the artist is not nearly as significant as the context in which it is surrounded by and perceived.

AFTER you are sure he has planted a 3rd (about 10:00minutes in), you drop your 4th, and you need to have some creep spread along the probable attack route.  The reason you drop spines is because once he has collosus, your zerglings are far less effective.  You can't drop minerals in a lot of roaches because almost all protoss mass immortal/sentry nowadays.  This leaves you with a ton of minerals, which you dump into drones/spines/queens.  I usually overdo the spines, which i reccomend you do in diamond to low masters.  Overdo is probably around 10+ by 14:30 and 20+ by 16:00.  about 13 at the main attack path (usually outside your 4th) and the other 7 by the less optimal attack path.  You need about 8 infestors to be support the spine wall.  Then you get a spire/hive, and get a GG of broodlords.  You're 2nd problem is before spine wall.  If he's doing a sentry/immortal all-in, you can scout this by seeing 4gas around 7minutes AND no 3rd at 9:30-10:00.

I bought a TV on my Amex but I had an $150 Best Buy gift card so I called Amex about the free coverage and they sent me to someone expert on it. I also asked my Visa Signature card company.  Amex: We'll cover any amount that was directly charged to your Amex. If the TV breaks in the coverage (after manufacturer's warranty is done and it's their turn) and I put $150 on the gift card, $650 on the Amex, they will repair the TV, replace with equivalent or better, or pay up to $650 for me to buy an equivalent or better TV (amount charged on card).  If I buy a gift card and charge the entire amount to it, no coverage.  Visa Signature: The entire amount of the purchase has to be charged directly to the Visa Signature card. If any other payment method is used (either buying a gift card or you put a penny or more on a split transaction where the entire amount did not go on the Visa), too bad, so sad regarding the coverage.",®

It's awful, and my heart goes out to you for having to maintain such an itinerary on a daily basis without an automobile.  You and your wife must love each other very much. The strength of relationships is determined by how they withstand pressure and heat, similar to how a shield is forged with a hammer and white-hot coals.   Your marriage must be stronger than wrought iron. You are both wonderful to each other to be enduring such draining circumstances, but remaining in the game. Perseverance under adverse circumstances is a hallmark of a person of integrity.   You are making strides towards regaining your former reality, and even possibly surpassing it! Schooling and the prestige a degree gives a person will work in your favor, as you certainly know. And hanging in there with that crappy work schedule is such a thing to be admired. I know that feeling *intimately*; right now, actually, I should be asleep for my shift in logistics at 4 AM. Such a schedule is intolerable, and you have my deepest sympathies with that particularly unfortunate similarity.  Hell.

Really get into this—you have nothing to lose. Make sure you write it out by hand.  ♦ When you’ve gotten absolutely everything off your mind and onto paper, put the letter aside.  ♦ Take a fresh sheet and write their response just the way you wish they would respond. You might have them taking responsibility for their actions, acknowledging and apologizing for everything they’ve ever done that hurt you. You don’t need to find any justification for their actions, just an acknowledgment and an apology. It’s your imagination, so you get to decide exactly what you’d like to hear.

t5_2rske,PanTardovski,1349473083,"&gt; where are the fat-rich foods? they don't mention them, are they implying that protein-rich foods are also fat-rich foods?.  You're working from the (potentially) false premise that fat-rich foods would exhibit some unique behavior. Just by reading the abstract you can see they did separate analysis by macro (""Protein, fibre, and water contents of the test foods correlated positively with SI scores (r = 0.37, P &lt; 0.05, n = 38; r = 0.46, P &lt; 0.01; and r = 0.64, P &lt; 0.001; respectively) whereas fat content was negatively associated (r = -0.43, P &lt; 0.01).""), and if you're concerned you can take the values for individual foods and construct your own arbitrary groups from the data in Tables 2 and 4.  The point of the study is not that ""carbohydrates are the most and the less satiating food"" but rather that a number of factors affect satiety, not simply one or two macronutrients. Again, if you'd paid attention you'd notice that the authors conclude ""Protein, fibre, and water ... correlated positively with SI scores,"" i.e. not carbohydrate content but rather sheer bulk would account for the potato's high score.  &gt; Oh, and to worsen things, that study is sponsored by Kellogg's.  Yes, I've fallen for Kellogg's brilliant plan to trick me into buying potatoes. Those bastards. Kellogg's® potatoes and steak and fish. Indeed.",®

t5_2qh9k,JimMarch,1349483699,"No...see, the Dred Scott decision reviews a bunch of horrible racist laws from the colonial period and early US - including laws supported by various ""founding fathers"".  Seriously.  The worst they reference if I recall right is one from Massachusetts in the early US period that said that if a white and black married, the marriage was to be declared invalid *and any children were to be legally declared bastards*.    That and other racist laws were described in horrible detail.  So yeah, the ruling can be fairly characterized as:  ""Racist laws have always been a part of the US therefore racist laws are OK today.""  :(  The sad part is, the decision was legally correct but a moral travesty.  So because of Dred Scott, here's a law Alabama passed in 1865 (right after the Civil War ended:  ----------  1.  That it shall not be lawful for any freedman, mulatto, or free person of color in this State, to own fire-arms, or carry about his person a pistol or other deadly weapon.  2.  That after the 20th day of January, 1866, any person thus offending may be arrested upon the warrant of any acting justice of the peace, and upon conviction fined any sum not exceeding $100 or imprisoned in the county jail, or put to labor on the public works of any county, incorporated town, city, or village, for any term not exceeding three months.  3.  That if any gun, pistol or other deadly weapon be found in the possession of any freedman, mulatto or free person of color, the same may by any justice of the peace, sheriff, or constable be taken from such freedman, mulatto, or free person of color; and if such person is proved to be the owner thereof, the same shall, upon an order of any justice of the peace, be sold, and the proceeds thereof paid over to such freedman, mulatto, or person of color owning the same. [Ed. note: the off-duty fashion choices of “justices of the peace, sheriffs, or constables” at that time tended toward an ensemble of basic white bedsheets with eyeholes...especially at night.]  4.  That it shall not be lawful for any person to sell, give, or lend fire-arms or ammunition of any description whatever, to any freedman, free negro or mulatto; and any person so violating the provisions of this act shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction thereof, shall be fined in the sum of not less than fifty nor more than one hundred dollars, at the discretion of the jury trying the case.  - from “The Second Amendment: Towards An African-Americanist Reconsideration”, footnote 178 — two more state-level examples precede that one.  http://www.guncite.com/journals/cd-recon.html - *[© 1991 Georgetown Law Journal]*",©

t5_2upx6,starrynightgirl,1349633221,"Yes there are a bunch of different methods for curling your lashes. In makeup school I learned to pinch once at the base, walk it out halfway and pinch again, then again a quarter way out. Believe me I’ve tried them all… have even tried spoons and heated curlers. And I’m sure you have your own techniques too (do share!). But today I am simply sharing this one because it is a game changer. Hear my voice in your head, sister: if you only pinch with the curler upright, you’re only doing it halfway! You have to then also pinch with the curler inverted. Trust me on this. It’s one of the biggest secrets I can share.  You’ll need:  A lash curler obviously! This one from MAC is my personal favorite (M·A·C 'Carine Roitfeld' Full Lash Curler) as it gives the strongest pinch or try my favorite more budget-friendly choice (Target Sonia Kashuk® Dramatically Defining Eye Lash Curler ).  Steps:  1. Insert your lashes into the opened curler and line it up right at your lashline, but not too close that you pinch the skin.  2. Pinch at the lashline; mostly to grab hold, not to make a crimp.  3. With that holding, rotate your wrist so that your thumb stays mostly in the same place and acts as the pivot point while your pinkie finger goes from being around your chin area all the way up towards your forehead.  4. Now that the curler is inverted, give your lashes a proper upside-down pinch for about 5 seconds. Really squeeze it as tightly as you can (without pulling of course).  5. Rotate your hand back to the starting position and carefully open the curler then slide it away from your lashes.  6. The most important step: tweet us before and after pictures! Or tag them #thebeautydepartment on Instagram!  7. Then you add a coat of mascara and bat your lashes at all the cuties out there. ",®

t5_2qpp6,SadCritters,1349651170,"I do believe most Zerg players feel as though Terrans deserve ""The World's Smallest Violin"" when it comes to this subject.  You THINK Zerg had a voice when things were bad for them....But they didn't. They complained and offered TONS of suggestions/changes to fix things....None were heard for a very, very long time.  Think back to how long it took even the smallest thing( Reaper insanity, for instance ) to get changed.  It took until allllll the way up until the Bunker ""Nerf"" ( Where salvage now costs Terrans a small amount of money. ) to try to stem the flow of Bunker-Rushes, wall-ins, and all-ins.   You DO get to voice your opinion as a Terran---We all hear it. It's on here every day from some Terran, just like it used to be from some random Zerg. Just like back then, ""The Whiners"" were downvoted.   It's not as one-sided as you're trying to make it out to be---It just feels worse because you're finally on the receiving end of it.   ( In the words of the infinite Terrans back then: ""Practice harder. [Insert player here ( Taeja )] is still winning, so why aren't you?"" )   'As far as fixing WOL is concerned---They are focused on HOTS with good reason: It's their new product and the majority of people will be persuing it.  Most people, including the professional scene, will be moving over to HOTS when it is released. The easiest thing for them to currently do is try to balance HOTS then apply their changes to ""old units"" to WOL. There's literally no reason to balance WOL, then try to work out balancing HOTS, then just have to change WOL again because the new units ""mess things up"".  What suggestion would you make to fixing TvP using Seige Tanks? I do not think people think very far ahead when it comes to balance on here. We just cry out that we want something changed and don't really offer a valid solution. What would you want done to them? Range changed? You can't really do that, because now you're messing with the TvT and ZvT metagame to extreme extents with no new units to even TRY to open up space to fix the issues.   These new units are proving to fix a lot of problems that the races are complaining about. Zergs now have an option that doesn't involve HAVING to go Broodlords just to try and crack and opponent's base open. ( Something the other two races have had. ) Protoss is getting the world's best ""Swiss Army Knife"" of a unit in the Mothership Core. It's not only defensive now, but absurdly offensive. It saves your army in a pinch, making base-trades near impossible. Terrans finally have another AOE unit in the Widow Mine----Of which I am SURE you can see every player on the planet complaining about, because of how balls-insane it is currently ( Which I expect some kind of change to. ). The Battle-Hellion also fills the role that seemed necessary to make Mech in TvP viable. Chargelots were a large problem for Terrans going mech and the Battle Hellion fixes this.   I'm sorry, but you're just feeling ""butt hurt"" like Zergs were in seasons 1 through 3. I have faith you'll figure out what you need to do to improve or that Blizzard will ""fix"" everything for you---As they always have for everyone. Struggle for a few seasons like Protoss and Zerg had to at the start of the game. 8) It'll be good for you. ♥  TL;DR: I still love you as a human, but you're feeling this way because it's finally affecting you. I am sure that in the first few seasons you were ""Terran it up"" so to speak. 8)",♥

t5_2r6f3,btcprox,1349702655,"Combinations Rule = the order of choosing from a set of elements doesn't matter, Permutations Rule = the order DOES matter. {a,b,c}, {b,a,c}, {c,a,b}, {c,b,a}, {b,c,a} and {a,c,b} are all different permutations, but are the same combination of the letters a, b and c.  Partitions Rule: If an event can be further declassified into 2 or more *disjoint* sub-events, the probability of this event happening = the sum of the individual probabilities of the sub-events. For instance, the event ""Bob is in school right now"" can be declassified into a few sub-events: Bob is in the canteen right now, Bob is in the library right now, Bob is in the lecture theatre right now, etc. Note that these sub-events are disjoint because he can't be in 2 places within the school at the same time. So P(Bob is in school right now) = P(Bob is in the canteen right now) + P(Bob is in the library right now) + P(Bob is in the lecture theatre right now) and so on.  Multiplicative Rule: If an event can be split into 2 or more *successive* sub-events, the probability of the event occurring = the product of the probabilities of the sub-events. E.g. when flipping a coin, P(flipping 2 heads in a row) = P(flipping heads the first time) \* P(flipping heads the second time). Note that this coin-flipping example involves *mutually exclusive* sub-events, i.e. whether you get heads the first time will not alter the probability of getting a second heads.   In the case of sub-events that are NOT mutually exclusive, extra care must be taken in calculating the probabilities. For instance, taking a standard poker card deck, P(drawing A♠ followed by Q♠) = P(drawing A♠ from the 52 cards) \* P(drawing Q♠ *from the remaining 51 cards*). Note that drawing the A♠ leaves 51 cards in the deck, which affects the probability of drawing the Q♠ next!",♠

t5_2cneq,Minifig81,1349732322,"The fourth president of the United States, James Madison, was much like the other Virginia presidents--Washington and Jefferson--who went before him. Like them, he loved his home state only a little less than his country. Like them, he was a rich man who gave his whole life to public service. He was an able student of politics and government who brought real knowledge and skill to his job. In public office Madison was a calm, reasoning statesman who governed by force of logic. In a time when emotions ran high, he made common sense prevail. He was not always successful in dealing with foreign nations, but history has shown that he had right and justice on his side. He entered the presidency at a time when war clouds hung over the young nation. He saw his country through the disastrous War of 1812, and his final months in office produced the ""era of good feeling"" that lasted for many years. He did well as secretary of state and as president, but his greatest record was made earlier. For his outstanding work on the nation's charter, Madison is known as the Father of the Constitution.    ""It may not be easy, in every possible case, to trace the line of separation between the rights of religion and the Civil authority with such distinctness as to avoid collisions and doubts on unessential points.  The tendency to unsurpastion on one side or the other, or to a corrupting coalition or alliance between them, will be best guarded agst. by an entire abstinence of the Gov't from interfence in any way whatsoever, beyond the necessity of preserving public order, and protecting each sect agst. trespasses on its legal rights by others.""                James Madison, ""James Madison on Religious Liberty"", edited by Robert S. Alley, ISBN 0-8975-298-X. pp. 237-238 .   ""What influence, in fact, have ecclesiastical establishments had on society?  In some instances they have been seen to erect a spiritual tyranny on the ruins of the civil authority; on many instances they have been seen upholding the thrones of political tyranny; in no instance have they been the guardians of the liberties of the people.  Rulers who wish to subvert the public liberty may have found an established clergy convenient auxiliaries.  A just government, instituted to secure and perpetuate it, needs them not.""         - ""A Memorial and Remonstrance"", 1785     ""Experience witnesseth that ecclesiastical establishments, instead of maintaining the purity and efficacy of religion, have had a contrary operation.  During almost fifteen centuries has the legal establishment of Christianity been on trial.  What has been its fruits?  More or less, in all places, pride and indolence in the clergy; ignorance and servility in the laity; in both, superstition, bigotry and persecution.""    - Ibid, 1785    ""Religious bondage shackles and debilitates the mind and unfits it for every noble enterprise.""       -letter to Wm. Bradford, April 1, 1774    ""Ecclesiastical establishments tend to great ignorance and corruption, all of which facilitate the execution of mischievous projects.""

t5_2qh1i,IronMew,1349783909,"I worded my reply poorly; I didn't mean that YOU don't have any brain, I meant that I doubt the mental capacity of anyone who suddenly goes ""OMG we're being lied to!!!11!"" as if it's something that only started happening in the last five years. I did not put you in that category.  The political system is broken to such a degree that anyone who gets into a position of relevant power should on no accounts be allowed to do the job. And anyone who has the potential to threaten the system is not allowed to achieve power, and therefore remains weak and unable to change anything.  The only way to change this would be to fake conformist positions until you're in power, then reveal your true intentions and renege all the promises you've made to the greedy bastards who enabled your rise. I imagine this would make you loved by the common people, but the EvilCorp® of the moment would probably soon be looking at the ""hitmen"" category on LinkedIn.  As for the military thing: I understand all your wants, and since you do seem to have a brain I'd be surprised if they were any different, but wanting things doesn't magically make them happen. As you say, it makes very little difference who you vote for nowadays; either is just as likely to send you protecting your country's ~~oil interests~~ freedom and democracy in deity-forsaken places whose leaders would prefer all the modern civilized world to just up and die.  If the political system made it possible to **actually** bring sanity to those places (who, let's face it, are in dire need of it), then I'd applaud you for a courageous choice; but as this is not the case, and since wherever you go you're very likely to just incite further hatred and tyranny from unhinged extremist groups and possibly from the very people you're hoping to protect, I don't really know how you hope being in the military is going to restore hope in humanity.  Or to put it in other words: I don't doubt that your intentions are good, but you're serving people who will make sure you're part of the problem rather than the solution.  Notice that I don't expect this to suddenly change your opinions and life choices, I'm just clarifying my point so you don't think I'm just pointing a finger at you and shouting ""HA-HA!"" like Nelson.

t5_2qhx4,gligoran,1349801971,"In tiny writing: The American Heritage® Dictionary of the English Language... Apparently only American English knows this as a pound sign.  This is the story behind it (source Wikipedia): &gt;Historically, the pound name derives from a series of abbreviations for pound, the unit of weight. At first ""lb."" was used; however, printers later designed a font containing a special symbol of an ""lb"" with a line through the verticals so that the lowercase letter ""l"" would not be mistaken for the numeral ""1"". Unicode character U+2114 ℔ l b bar symbol (HTML: &amp;#8468;) is a cursive development of this symbol. Ultimately, the symbol was reduced for clarity as an overlay of two horizontal strokes ""="" across two forward-slash-like strokes ""//"".[1] Keith Gordon Irwin, in The Romance of Writing, p. 125, says ""The Italian libbra (from the old Latin word libra, 'balance') represented a weight almost exactly equal to the avoirdupois pound of England. The Italian abbreviation of lb with a line drawn across the letters [℔] was used for both weights. The business clerks' hurried way of writing the abbreviation appears to have been responsible for the # sign used for pound.""",®

t5_2qmeb,MrPattywagon,1349805221,"PETA doesn't think Pokemon is evil.  &gt;PokÃ©mon deserves praise for promoting good care and affection for other living beings–even imaginary ones. However, real animals in the real world shouldn’t be confined to small spaces against their will–whether it’s a Poke Ball or a cage for egg-laying hens. The world of PokÃ©mon is clearly fictional, and we trust that most kids can see this distinction. However, parents may want to ensure that their children understand that while cartoon animals living in imaginary Poke Balls is all in good fun, real animals should always be treated with compassion and respect and should never be condemned to life in a cage. -PETA’s official response when asked their stance on PokÃ©mon.  This might seem confusing, but it's because people are misunderstanding the medium of the message for the message itself.  PETA wants to send a message to people who play their parody that the amount of emotion and protectiveness they have for Pokemon in a fictional game might be appropriate for animals in the real world. They obviously grossly misrepresented how the Pokemon world actually works - but the intent isn't to lambast or criticize Pokemon as evil. The idea is to deliver a message about animal cruelty and animal suffering/well-being *in our world* in a way that people can easily access and understand, though fiction. And by ""people"" I mean kids.  It also creates media hype because I'm sure PETA could predict that this parody would create a lot of anger.  In any case, don't confuse the medium of the message for the message itself and you'll understand what PETA is trying to do.",©

t5_2qhlm,upton-ogood,1349889946,"&gt;[W]hen [tests] become a thing evaluated without respect to if they are consistent with anything else they become silly.  I'd just like, if I could, to underscore and amplify this particular point. I've posted [this article](http://epaa.asu.edu/ojs/article/view/1096/982) elsewhere on this thread, and it's definitely worth a read. I honestly wish more people would read the critical research that's being done on this sort of nonsense and shout the findings from the rooftops. Here are some excerpts regarding the findings of the authors' study [emphasis added]:  **Reliability**  According its developers, SAS® EVAAS® is meant to “assess and predict student performance with precision and reliability” and it is “the most robust and reliable” value-added system available, more than the “other simplistic models found in the market today” (SAS, 2011). In terms of the data presented here, however, it is clear that inconsistencies were a consistent problem. Across the four cases, issues with reliability were evident. Such issues with reliability are also well documented in the literature (Au, 2010; Baeder, 2010; Baker et al, 2010; CCSSO, 2010; Haertel, 2011; Koedel &amp; Betts, 2007; Papay, 2010, Shaw &amp; Bovaird, 2011; Schochet &amp; Chiang, 2010).   Yet these four teachers were removed from their teaching positions “at least in part” due to SAS® EVAAS® data that in three of the four cases researchers evidenced as unreliable (see Tables 1-4). **The probability that three of the four teachers added or detracted value from year-to-year was roughly the same as the flip of a coin. This is pragmatically, methodologically, conceptually, and morally concerning.** In addition, as researchers suggest that at least three years of value-added data are needed to make such judgments (Brophy, 1973; Cody et al., 2010; Harris, 2011), and even then with a 25% risk of misclassification (Au, 2010; CCSSO, 2010; Otterman, 2010; Schochet &amp; Chiang, 2010; Shaw &amp; Bovaird, 2011), this is also troublesome. Not one of the four teachers had three years of consistent data (that were detectibly different from other similar teachers) to warrant nonrenewal. Other HISD teachers whom researchers interviewed (Collins, in progress) noted concerns about this as well, again comparing the receipt of merit monies based on SAS® EVAAS® data to “winning the lottery.” One eighth grade advanced English teacher noted:   &gt;I do what I do every year. I teach the way I teach every year. [My] first year got me pats on the back. [My] second year got me kicked in the backside. And for year three my scores were off the charts. I got a huge bonus, and now I am in the top quartile of all the English teachers. **What did I do differently? I have no clue.**  A 7th grade history teacher classified her past three years as “bonus, bonus, disaster.” A social studies teacher added:   &gt;We had an 8th grade teacher, a very good teacher, the “real science guy,” [who was a] very good teacher…[but] every year he showed low [SAS®] EVAAS® growth. My principal flipped him with the 6th grade science teacher who was getting the highest [SAS®] EVAAS® scores on campus. Huge [SAS®] EVAAS® scores. [And] now the 6th grade teacher [is showing] no growth [as an 8th grade teacher], but the 8th grade teacher who was sent down [to the 6th grade] is getting the biggest bonuses on campus.   SAS® EVAAS® developers claim they have evidence that teachers who move from one environment to another, even if radically different, continue to do as well and are classified the same in SAS® EVAAS® terms over time (LeClaire, 2011). Evidence presented herein should yield caution regarding this assertion.  **Bias**  Teachers credited such “chaos” to the different students they taught and the different classroom contexts in which they taught year-to-year. For example, **while Teacher C’s SAS® EVAAS® data illustrated that Teacher C consistently detracted value from her students’ learning, and did so across subject areas, this was likely because Teacher C taught some of the highest-need students, possibly across the district.**  In addition, HISD teachers note that those teaching inordinate numbers of special education students in mainstreamed classrooms are least likely to add value (Collins, in progress). Teachers teaching the same students over consecutive years (e.g., looping) report receiving bonuses for the first year and nothing the next as they are “maxing out” on growth, and actually “competing with themselves.” **Teachers agree that it is best for them “to get average kids, yes, because the regular kids, you can grow those kids!”**  Teachers teaching gifted students report finding it very difficult to add value and get merit pay as a result (Collins, in progress; see also Wright, Horn, &amp; Sanders, 1997). They report being able to “only get them up so much!” One teacher working with gifted students noted:   &gt;Every year I have the highest test scores, [and] I have fellow teachers that [sic] come up to me when they get their bonuses…One recently came up to me [and] literally cried, ‘I’m so sorry.’… I’m like, ‘Don’t be sorry…It’s not your fault.’ Here I am…with the highest test scores and I’m getting $0 in bonuses. It makes no sense year-to-year how this works…. How do I, how do I, you know, I don’t know what to do. **I don’t know how to get higher than a 100%.**  Another 5th grade teacher working with gifted students explained:  &gt;I have students [in a 5th grade gifted reading class] who score at the 6th, 7th, &amp; 8th grade levels in reading. **But I’m like please babies, score at the 9th grade level, cause if you don’t score at the 9th or 10th grade or higher in 5th grade with me, I’m going to show negative growth.** Even though you, you’re gifted, and you’re talented, and you’re high! I can only push you so much higher when you are already so high. I’m scared.  Teachers teaching in grades in which ELLs were transitioned into mainstreamed English only classrooms also report being the least likely to add value. One 4th grade teacher noted:  &gt;I went to a transition classroom, and now there’s a red flag next to my name. I guess now I’m an ineffective teacher? I keep getting letters from the district, saying ‘You’ve been recognized as an outstanding teacher’…this, this, and that. But now because I teach English Language Learners who ‘transition in,’ my scores drop? And I get a flag next to my name for not teaching them well?  A 5th grade teacher added:  &gt;I’m scared to teach in the 4th grade. **I’m scared I might lose my job if I teach in a[n] [ELL] transition grade level, because I’m scared my scores are going to drop, and I’m going to get fired because there’s probably going to be no growth.**  Another 4th/5th grade teacher explained, **“When they say nobody wants to do 4th grade – nobody wants to do 4th grade! Nobody”** (Collins, in progress). This was evidenced in the data collected for Teacher D as well who, like Teacher A, switched back and forth across subject areas until her last year during which she purportedly detracted value across subject areas. This was the year her supervisor assigned her to teach an ELL transition year, during which an inordinate number of ELLs entered her classroom.  **Until SAS® EVAAS® developers can evidence that teachers teaching inordinate numbers of ELLs particularly in transition years, and teachers teaching special education or gifted students are not disparately impacted by the non-random placement of these students into their classrooms (Monk, 1987; Rothstein, 2009), terminating teachers on these grounds is remiss and morally indefensible.** Just recently, both SAS® EVAAS® and HISD’s Chief Human Resources Officer acknowledged via email that ceiling effects adversely impacted some teachers working with gifted students in their capacities to demonstrate value-added (A. Best, personal communication, January 21, 2012).  On the contrary, SAS® EVAAS® developers continue to claim that student background factors do not impact students’ ability to grow year-to-year in the SAS® EVAAS® model, mainly because the system uses students’ previous years of data as “blocking factors” to prevent such variables from biasing or distorting growth (Sanders &amp; Horn, 1994, 1998; Sanders et al., 2009; Wright, White, Sanders, &amp; Rivers, 2010). As evidenced here, these claims might not be entirely true. Appropriately, this is also one of SAS® EVAAS® developer’s most highly contested claims (AmreinBeardsley, 2008; Ballou, Sanders, &amp; Wright, 2004; Braun, 2005; Cody et al., 2010; Kuppermintz, 2003; McCaffrey et al., 2003; McCaffrey, Lockwood, Koretz, Louis, &amp; Hamilton, 2004b; Sanders &amp; Wright, 2008; Sanders et al., 2009; Tekwe, Carter, Ma, Algina, Lucas, Roth et al., 2004).",®

t5_2qhlm,upton-ogood,1349890070,"**Teacher Attribution**  The aforementioned lack of reliability could also be due to other context-related issues that further complicate the calculation of a teacher’s value-added. Teacher B, for example, whose SAS® EVAAS® scores were negative for two years and positive for the most recent year for which she had data, taught for the same years alongside a math enrichment teacher who taught almost half of her students at the same time and an equal amount of time per week. Teacher A was not a teacher of record for approximately 50% of her students one of the years for which she was held accountable using the SAS® EVAAS® because she was moved from teaching the third to the fourth grade midyear. Another HISD teacher taught alongside a reading specialist four days per week, and then posted the most growth and received the largest bonus she ever had (Collins, in progress). It is uncertain whether the reading specialist received a bonus for her apparent contributions as well.   **Nonetheless, these instances raise concerns about the percentage of value teachers under this system add to, or detract from their students’ learning and achievement and whether they can be held responsible for 100% of their students’ scores. These issues might also play into why such inconsistencies are evident. Determining what percent of value-added scores can be attributed to teachers is very difficult, if even possible** (Campbell &amp; Stanley, 1963; Corcoran, 2010; Ishii, &amp; Rivkin, 2009; Kane &amp; Staiger, 2008; Kennedy, 2010; Linn, 2008; Nelson, 2011; Papay, 2010; Rothstein, 2009).  SAS® EVAAS® developers claim, though, that through a linking verification process (during which teachers mark for what percent of each student’s instruction (s)he should be held accountable) they can partition out different teachers’ value-added effects (Derringer, 2010; Sanders &amp; Horn, 1994). However, **there is no empirical evidence suggesting that numerically splitting or dividing teacher effects accurately accounts for a teacher’s contribution.** In addition, not only is such a practice counterintuitive, but breaking up effort across teachers using percentages and proportions is nonsensical given the interaction effects that occur among and between students and teachers (Monk, 1987). Teachers are situated in complex and collaborative learning environments. **It is highly unlikely their value-added effects can be fractionalized using simple or even complex mathematics and statistics.**  **Criterion-Related Evidence of Validity**  One way to generate criterion-related evidence of validity is to assess whether teachers who demonstrate added value are also the teachers deemed effective through other, independent measures of teacher quality concurrently or at the same time (see also McCaffrey, Lockwood, Koretz, Louis, &amp; Hamilton, 2004a). In this instance, researchers examined whether the four nonrenewed teachers also seemed to be ineffectual given their PDAS scores, specifically to determine if these teachers’ supervisors also observed that these teachers were inadequate.   Analyzing the four teachers’ SAS® EVAAS® scores over time alongside their PDAS scores, researchers found statistical signals indicating that both of these measures were not measuring the teaching effectiveness construct accurately and consistently across teachers. The better Teacher A did on the SAS® EVAAS® the worse she did in the eyes of her supervisor(s) (r = -0.51, r = -0.83, r = -0.11). Yet for Teacher B, the better she did on the SAS® EVAAS® the better she did on the PDAS (r = 0.91). This yields the type of correlation coefficient we would expect to see if in fact both indicators pointed in the same direction, yielding valid results. Researchers were not able to analyze Teacher C’s math SAS® EVAAS® scores alongside her PDAS scores, but her social studies SAS® EVAAS® and PDAS scores were mildly related (r = 0.26). For Teacher D there were weak to strong results (r = 0.29, r = 0.92). The conclusion here is that there is nothing substantive to evidence that a valid teacher evaluation system, based on SAS® EVAAS® and PDAS scores, is in place and in use. This assertion is however limited by the small sample size herein.  Additionally, analyzing all four teachers’ SAS® EVAAS® scores over time alongside their bonuses, **researchers found that both of these measures failed to assess the teaching effectiveness construct accurately and consistently across teachers as well.** The worse Teacher A did on the SAS® EVAAS® the more money she received (r = -0.42), and the better Teacher B did the more money she received (r = 0.93). Teacher C’s monetary bonuses and SAS® EVAAS® scores were mildly related (r = 0.29), and Teacher D’s monetary bonuses and SAS® EVAAS® scores were more strongly related (r = 0.79). Again, the small sample size certainly limits generalizability here, although evidence of this occurring elsewhere exists (Collins, in progress; Harris, 2011).   In addition, three of four teachers were honored with teaching awards (e.g., teacher of the year or month awards) during the same years for which they posted SAS® EVAAS® data that at least in part led to their contracts not being renewed. Teacher C ironically received a Teacher of the Year award, awarded to her by her peers, at the same time she detracted the most value from her students’ learning according to her SAS® EVAAS® data. This raises additional concerns about whether these indicators are capturing the teaching effectiveness construct effectively, or validly. See notes above about sample size limitations.",®
t5_2qhlm,upton-ogood,1349890098,"**External Pressures**  It is also important to note that **these teachers felt that they were targeted for termination because of the performance of the schools in which they taught**, which were labeled “in-need-of-improvement” under NCLB. According to the four teachers, **administrators were under intense district and state pressure, and administrators set out or were forced to “restructure the school” and “start firing teachers.”** Teachers A, B, C, and D all felt that they were part of “a larger plan.” Because they believed their supervisors perceived them to have low, or possibly lower value-added scores than their peers, the teachers felt that they had been put “on a list.” It was at this time when they became most vulnerable, and when their PDAS observational scores plummeted.   Teacher A, for example, “exceeded expectations” on her yearly PDAS reports until 2010-2011 when a new principal arrived and ranked her “proficient” or “below expectations” across domains. Teacher B’s PDAS scores dropped as well, but her supervisor wrote on her PDAS form that she could not have earned higher scores because the state classified the school’s scores as “unacceptable.” Three different administrators evaluated Teacher C and she consistently “exceeded expectations,” but in 2010-2011 when she was evaluated by a short-term administrator, she too wasrated as “proficient” or “below expectations” across the board. Similarly, Teacher D’s supervisor’s actions became perceptibly more aggressive.   **Other teachers noted that their supervisors were beginning to skew their observational scores given external pressures to do so** (Collins, in progress). One social studies teacher stated:  &gt;Here’s the problem: No principal wants to be called in by the superintendent or another superior and [asked], ‘How come your teachers show negative growth but you have high evaluations on them? Are you doing your job? I don’t understand. Your teacher shows no growth but you have [marked them] as exceeding expectations all up and down the chart?’ **Now it’s not just this [sic] data over here that’s gonna harm us, it’s the principals [who are] adjusting our data over there to match the [SAS®] EVAAS®. So it looks like they’re being consistent.**  A middle school teacher agreed: “Well my evaluations were fine, but of course now they have to make the evaluation match the SAS® EVAAS®. We now have to go through that.” An 8th grade teacher added:   &gt;They’re not about to go to bat [for us, although] a few of them will. But **most of them are going to go in there, and they’re going to create a teacher evaluation that reflects the [SAS® EVAAS®] data because they don’t want to have to explain, again and again, why they’re giving high classroom observation assessments when the data shows [sic] that the teacher is low performing.**  A 4th grade teacher noted, “Our principal pressures us. You bet she pressures. **If you don’t make [SAS® EVAAS®], then it goes against you in your PDAS. In a roundabout way she finds a way to put that against you.”** An 8th grade advanced English teacher added:  &gt;My boss had to go to the district superintendent and explain why we needed to be kept, when ultimately the data showed that we weren’t good teachers… [But] you’ve got other good teachers who are being thrown under the bus because of this system.  From these teachers’ perspectives, it seems that many district administrators are more trusting of SAS® EVAAS® and are skewing PDAS data to match. **This makes sense in theory, as the SAS® EVAAS® is the objective system that the district has purchased, and traditional observational scores are increasingly being dismissed as subjective** (Harris, 2011). In Tennessee and New York there is evidence of local policies pushing such practices (Baker, 2012; Garland, 2012; Ravitch, 2012), **although again such practices contradict the field standards encouraging the use of multiple measures for decision-making** (AERA, APA, &amp; NCME, 2000).  **Diagnostics and Formative Uses**  Overall, Teachers A, B, C, and D were only familiar with SAS® EVAAS®. They understood that they were being compared to other similar teachers within the district, and they understood their scores were available each year via the district’s online portal system, but that was about the extent of their knowledge. **Nobody had explained their SAS® EVAAS® data to them, and none of the four teachers understood what their SAS® EVAAS® numbers meant, how they were calculated, how their SAS® EVAAS® scores could be “used against [them],” or conversely how they could use their SAS® EVAAS® scores to help them improve their instruction**. Teacher D took steps to figure out her SAS® EVAAS® scores on her own, but her SAS® EVAAS® scores still “just did not hit home” (see also Eckert &amp; Dabrowski, 2010).   The four terminated teachers **did not receive professional development from HISD or SAS® EVAAS® as a result of their value-added scores** either. However, given the scores illustrated in Tables 1-4, whether each teacher needed professional development to improve their value-added scores is disputable. Because they were terminated at least in part due to their SAS® EVAAS® scores, and because they were reportedly not given professional development to improve their scores, this too is troublesome. Similarly, **none of the teachers noted that they used SAS® EVAAS® data to inform their instruction, in many ways because they did not understand it.**  In short, no data suggest that for these four teachers in HISD that the SAS® EVAAS® system “provides valuable diagnostic information about [instructional] practices,” helps educators become more proactive and make more “sound instructional choices,” and helps teachers use their “resources more strategically to ensure that every student has the chance to succeed” (SAS, 2011). In addition, 60% of a sample of HISD teachers indicate that they are not using SAS® EVAAS® data to inform their instruction either. This is not to say, however, that this is not occurring elsewhere, perhaps in the district for the other 40% (taking into account sampling error) or in other states, districts, and schools using the SAS® EVAAS® system (see, for example, marketing testimonials available on the SAS website, SAS, 2012).",®
t5_2t187,ManyLabels,1349892656,"Thanks for the warm welcome. Allow me to get into some of the points you made.     &gt;You've already received many comments here that say the labels are totally optional. So I hope you will feel no pressure to use them. And by raising the issue you've started a terrific discussion.    I'm glad you appreciate the discussion, that's kind of what I was hoping to achieve. I don't necessarily feel pressured, especially after having read through the other comments. ♥   &gt;I'm wondering whether you are feeling the anger many of us feel about the way labels are used in the world.    I think that's exactly what my issue is right now. My girlfriend and I haven't been together for very long (a couple of months) and although I didn't need the trans 101 (I've moderated a forum section specifically for trans youth), I did become more serious in researching the issues that come with being or dating a trans person. Throughout my research I came across lots of terminology that I had to look up or ask her about, which confronted me with the fact that those terms were often meant to categorize people into sub-sections of human kind. Suddenly I'm not just me, but I'm a cisgender woman with a MtF girlfriend, so that makes me pansexual instead of bisexual. Shock!   My general thoughts after posting the thread and reading through the comments:   One could argue that some labels are simply relevant at all times, but that would imply that some labels are more relevant than others and therefor deserve to be displayed every time I post. That in turn raises the question in my mind of ""which ones are more relevant than the rest of them?"" For arguments sake, lets investigate some of the labels that could be applied to me.  * I'm a mother. * I'm a cisgender person. * I'm a woman. * I'm pansexual. * I'm the owner of a red cat. * I'm Dutch. * I'm the partner of a transgender person. * I'm an administrative worker. * I'm a daughter. * I'm kinky. * I'm a sister. * I'm a gamer. * I'm poly. * I'm a left wing voter. * I'm in a long distance relationship. * etc. etc.  So which of these are relevant enough for me to display on every post? Being a mother is just as valuable to me as being someone's partner. Being a woman is just as valuable to me as being Dutch. All of these potential labels may be relevant to the issues me and my partner deal with. For example: do we tell my son about her 'status' (as she calls it) or not? Or: are violent crimes against trans people more common in the US than in the Netherlands? I feel that I could easily address the particular labels that apply to that specific issue if and when I bring it into the discussion.    **TL;DR**   I'm glad it's not a requirement, so I'll stick with my labelless existence for now.

t5_2tr4p,pookzta,1349908488,"write your congressmen and women using the template below:  Dear Congressional Representative,  I am writing to ask that you please support medical use and decriminalization of marijuana because science has now verified its therapeutic properties beyond any reasonable doubt, and this important information must be learned by every congressional representative, policy maker, and law enforcement officer so that our government and health care systems can be updated and improved accordingly. Pharmaceutical corporations even manufacture marijuana-based drugs such as Sativex and Marinol, but these synthetic chemicals do not have the efficacy that organic marijuana has for many patients. Additionally, marijuana does not have to be smoked to experience its therapeutic benefits, for it can also be eaten or juiced as well. Please consider the following scientific information:  ...[DEA] Judge Young found that ""marijuana, in its natural form, is one of the safest therapeutically active substances known to man.... At present it is estimated that marijuana's LD-50 [median lethal dose] is around 1:20,000 or 1:40,000. In layman's terms... a smoker would theoretically have to consume 20,000 to 40,000 times as much marijuana as is contained in one marijuana cigarette... nearly 1500 pounds of marijuana within about fifteen minutes to induce a lethal response."" (New England Journal of Medicine: Legal Issues in Medicine, August 7, 1997 -- Volume 337, Number 6)  ""Toxicity is virtually nonexistent in natural marijuana. The toxicity levels of cannabis compounds are estimated at 40,000, meaning that a subject would have to ingest 40,000 times the regular dose to induce death. “In layman’s terms,” according to The New England Journal of Medicine, ""a smoker would theoretically have to consume nearly 1,500 pounds of marijuana within about fifteen minutes to induce a lethal response."" [1] While that amount of consumption is certainly an impossible feat, in comparison, legal prescription medications cause thousands of deaths per year. [2] Common household drugs are much more lethal than marijuana. For instance, a lethal dose of caffeine is equal to about 100 cups of coffee. [3]  In 1972, after reviewing the scientific evidence, the National Commission on Marijuana and Drug Abuse concluded that while marijuana was not entirely safe, its dangers had been grossly overstated. [4] Since then, researchers have conducted thousands of studies on humans, animals and cell cultures. None of those describe any findings dramatically different from those described by the National Commission in 1972. [5] In 2008, The Canadian Medical Association Journal published a review of research spanning 30 years, concluding that there are no serious adverse effects of cannabis use.[6]  Contaminants, however, are known to be hazardous, especially to those suffering from immune disorders.

No, that means that they initiated copyrights in all of those years; the copyrights then continue to exist/be in force for 25+ years, depending on the type of copyright and whether or not they renew them.  Check on ""fair use"" rules. You can use a reasonable excerpt as long as you credit the source. The format of your credit (or citation) will likely depend on whether this is for school (MLA/APA style) or business (Chicago Style Manual? Legal? etc.).  In some cases, you may also want to contact the copyright owner to ask if you can use a larger excerpt, or the entire work. I did this when I was developing an operations manual for a charitable organisation and found a sample published on the web by another charitable org.

As far as I can tell legalism is when a person believes he/she earns her way to God's favor by keeping the law or doing other good works.  It would be strange to define any thing as anti-God that actually paid attention to what God said to do.  Psalm 19:7--*The law of the LORD is perfect, reviving the soul; the testimony of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple;*  Why is this in the Bible? http://www.esvbible.org/Psalm+119/  Paul said: Acts 24:14 *But this I confess to you, that according to the Way, which they call a sect, I worship the God of our fathers, believing everything laid down by the Law and written in the Prophets,*   When he 'disappeared' from his parents, do you remember where he was?  How did he know where the disciples could find the donkey and why did he tell them to tell the owner, ""the Lord has need of him""?  It seems that you are the one who is twisting things here.

Please read more carefully.  &gt; If so, how do you define sin? Can you support your definition with God's Word?

John says that ""Everyone who sins breaks the law""... not ""Everyone who breaks the law sins"" so perhaps there are some laws that can be broken without sinning?  I don't believe lawlessness applies to people who break a few laws, I believe lawlessness refers to a person who has complete disregard for all law.  Ok, let's go to court now.  &gt; When he 'disappeared' from his parents, do you remember where he was?   So it's ok to dishonor your earthly mother and father if you are supporting the Church?

And Frank Herbert was doing a great job on his own of devolving his Dune universe even before Brian came into the picture (one master-work, followed by ever-more-poorly-written, and ridiculous, sequels). A few years back I picked up a novel by Dick *and Felix* Francis and you could see what was comming: A Professional Heir, who went on to write heavy-handed novels with none of the subtlety or charm of the father, but all with the 'Dick Francis' brand attached.  I can only be grateful that Martha Grimes, Tony Hillerman, and Lois McMaster Bujold seem to have no children with literary pretentions, AFAIK.   Terry Pratchett, OTOH, has already done so many colaborations that it seems likely that one of them will take up his mantle when his mind finally goes. (And yet, almost all of his books are © Terry **and Lyn** Pratchett, which I find kinda charming, and wise of family man).

t5_2qm7x,kaminix,1349989304,"&gt; You can eat whomever you wish, but be aware that most people draw the lines on species boundaries. The median-functioning human is so many orders of magnitude above the median-functioning animal of any livestock breed (pigs would be the closest) that the ""draw the line"" argument, in addition to being inherently fallacious (though useful for opening peoples' eyes), is a little awkward to apply here.  I don't think it's fallacious at all. We all do draw the line somewhere, like at plants or insects. What's fallacious is to draw it so close. We say the mammalian body works just like ours in every possible sense - except for the brain.  Sure we're leaps and bounds away from most (all?) animals in terms of mental capacity, but how is intelligence even important? It's the emotional value we should be considerate of, just like we are with fellow humans (we don't base our empathy on cognitive capacity), and there's no reason to believe this isn't as strong in other mammals as it is in us. Perhaps if people were drawing the line at reptiles or something it would at least be understandable, I could almost sympathize with them (in fact this is the first time I've thought of reptiles, spontaneous reaction would be to give them a benefit of doubt).  &gt; Yes, though I would claim that it's more relative than arbitrary. Perceived personality activates a ""don't eat this"" response, which is why people don't name livestock. Everyone I know acknowledges this. They acknowledge how arbitrary/relative it is. Some people are simply comfortable without an absolute scale or place an absolute scale on their own species.  And this is irrational. With not naming livestock (apart from being very impractical) and not considering a scale you're circumventing empathy which would otherwise be undeniable.  &gt; Yes. That's the only kind of meat eater I truly hate. The people that should be vegetarians but plugs ears ""LALALALALALALALALA"".  &gt; Please keep in mind I'm providing a quote and my opinions on it as a vegetarian and former meat-eater. Don't shoot the messenger.  I don't really hate any meat eater, but I see little difference between poor excuses and complete negligence. Possibly that the poor excuses are not only ignoring the problem but actively circumventing it, and I'm not sure which is worse.  I'm not shooting anyone, I'm vegan. ♥ :-)",♥

From the Diva Cup website &gt;Please note the following when using The DivaCup with an internal birth control device such as an IUD or NuvaRing®.  &gt;The DivaCup is worn low at the base of the vagina and away from the cervix. This means that it should not interfere with an internal birth control device. However, please use caution when using any internal feminine hygiene product with an IUD as there is the possibility that they can be dislodged. When using The DivaCup, it is important to carefully follow the directions in our User Guide, paying close attention to inserting The DivaCup low in the vaginal canal and breaking the seal (suction) before removal. Many of our customers use The DivaCup with an IUD or NuvaRing® simultaneously, but we recommend that you become familiar with your birth control device’s risks (such as the body expelling the IUD, etc.).",®

They sometimes can be difficult to spot in the urban jungle, but if you know the signs, you can easily avoid them.  Usually, they can be found in packs.  Many of them wear baseball caps askew upon their heads, and some wear their pants so low you can see the hems of their boxers.  This is a mating habit... it announces to the others that they are ready for copulation.  In urban slang, they call it Dee Tee Eff.  Note the slack-jaw, the vacant stare in the eyes, and the general slump in their posture.  You'll often hear these guys telling stories about their sexual conquests (75% of which are lies) with their friends, and anyone who makes them feel uncomfortable and inferior will be insulted with neanderthalic barbs such as ""hey there, Poindexter,"" or ""you must be a virgin!""

t5_2tjl0,tommorris,1350080875,"One thing I've looked at recently is how some employers now seem to want to perpetuate a stereotypical masculinity in order to attract younger male employees.  Look into the stuff going on with Kixeye recently, and the whole ""brogrammers"" thing. Businesses buying into young male macho bullshit as a ""company culture"". Why? Well, simple. You hire a bunch of young guys, keep them there by making it like a big old frat party, with beer and Red Bull and a whole load of casual sexism. They are too dumb to realise that there might be more to life than this. At the same time, you don't have to hire any women (who might, oh, get pregnant and you'd have to pay them for maternity leave) or older workers (who have families and kids and so on, so are less likely to pull heroic all-nighters and actually insist on some work-life balance). The almost ridiculous macho culture is key to the economic exploitation.  Once you step back from the whole silly cult of macho, you see that it's there to flog you shit (you are a real man, better buy things to do manly things with), to keep you amused in a shitty job (hey, they are paying me less than the market average, but I get to make ironic misogynistic jokes with these Cool Guys®), and to make you keep up your end of the masculine/feminine bargains: I mean, if you truly love your girl, you gotta be a real man and buy her a big ol' blood diamond to show her you love her.  That's not to say there's not good bits about masculinity. As a gay dude, I fucking adore me some big old hunky man. There's a certain something about broad shoulders, six packs and, well, big, erm, shoes that does it in a way that twinky effeminacy doesn't. Yes, I know I'm shallow. But the point is that not letting that dick-thinking rule all of your life. Yes, that kind of homoerotic masculinity is sexy. But that doesn't mean that I have to buy into the ridiculous cultural baggage that advertisers and others want to associate with masculinity.",®

t5_2ukje,sasha_fierce79,1350095534,"Here's my addition to the contest. Based on the book, Candles Burning: http://imgur.com/BjwF8   Here is the basis of the book:  Seven-year-old Calley Dakin is thrown into the all-female whirlwind of her mother's family when her father is gruesomely murdered. The Carrolls fancy themselves Alabama aristocracy and scheme amongst themselves as well as with others to grab the wealth that undergirds the pretense. That scheming involves Calley, whose extraordinary ears hear not only the living but also the dead, whom she sometimes sees, too. She doesn't know she's the eye of the family storm, much less who she can trust, as she is carted from home to Grandmother Mamadee's to the Victorian house on the Gulf of Mexico in which she grows up. McDowell, who wrote the stories on which Beetlejuice and The Nightmare before Christmas are based, hadn't finished this lightly supernatural confection when he died in 1999. King completes it beautifully as to tone, aura, and flavor, and it's funny and intriguing, magnetically readable.

I've experienced -52 to -56 (C or F, I assume C) winters every year. I call bullshit on exploding trees, blue sparks and ""whispers of the stars"".

t5_2fwo,RabidRaccoon,1350170252,"The sad thing is I used Windows Mobile for ages. Sure it was a bit ornery but you could fix that with a custom Rom. E.g.  http://www.jayceooi.com/2010/08/12/download-htc-hd2-cookie-energy-windows-mobile-6-5-x-custom-rom/  And it had a selection of third party apps like Pleco and Opera that Windows Phone can only dream of. Those were all C/C++ and Win32.  The Microsoft decided to stop all those apps running on Windows Phone 7 and told everyone to rewrite fucking everything in managed C# and XNA or Silverlight. Microsoft apps like Internet Explorer were still Win32. Adobe were offered a pass to use native code but they decided it wasn't worth the hassle.  Also that third party browsers would not be allowed. By that point most of the third party stuff (which of course used third party unmanaged libraries) was running on Android and/or iPhone. So everyone just announced they'd skip WP7 and obsoleted their Windows Mobile Builds.   Then in WP8 the strategy changed again. Microsoft moved back to C++ but to a new API, WinRT. All the WP7 C# XNA apps will be compiled by a [cloud compiler](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11199234/compiling-windows-phone-8-app-in-cloud) into native code or something unless they decide not to, but if you want to use the new features you're supposed to rewrite fucking everything in C++ and use the WinRT API  http://www.i-programmer.info/news/189-windows-phone/4559-windows-phone-8-sdk-leaked-no-javascript-apps.html  &gt; It appears that you can create Silverlight and XNA apps using SDK but these will only run on Windows Phone 7.1. In other words, these project types cannot target WP8.  &gt; &gt; This seems to confirm the suspicions that, with WP8, Silverlight and XNA are no longer supported for future and on-going projects. This means that WP7.1 Silverlight/XNA apps are legacy apps  Microsoft wants the way of the future to be WinRT, whether it is on the desktop or the mobile. &gt; &gt; The best you can do is to use the upgrade option, but you cannot upgrade XNA based apps just WP7 Silverlight apps. For XNA apps all you can do is to continue to work on them as WP7.1 apps. Some of the XNA framework is available for use in your brand new WP8 app, however.   Needless to say there [hasn't exactly been a stampede to the hot new platform](http://www.plecoforums.com/viewtopic.php?p=22998#p22998)  http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/09/26/windows_store_numbers/  &gt; The number of apps in Windows Store - Microsoft’s online software shop - has apparently doubled in 10 days. &gt; &gt; The code bazaar, Redmond's equivalent of Apple’s wildly successful App Store, distributes software for x86 and ARM-powered Windows 8 machines. On 21 September it broke the 2,000 app barrier with 2,079 available downloads.  ...  &gt; The store offered 530 apps on 16 August, and broke the 1,000 barrier on 5 September, according to Directions on Microsoft. Windows 8 for x86 was released to manufacturers on 15 August. The store emerged in February with the first public preview release of Windows 8. &gt; &gt; To put this in perspective, Apple’s App Store holds roughly 650,000 apps, up from 550,000 in March, with 225,000 just for the iPad. The total number of App Store downloads to date is 30 billion. Apple's shop, which opened in July 2008, also has 400 million users. These numbers were announced by Apple at its World Wide Developer Conference (WWDC) in June. ®  This is interesting too  http://pages.appcelerator.com/Q32012AppceleratorIDCSurveyReport.html  http://www.appcelerator.com.s3.amazonaws.com/pdf/Appcelerator-Report-Q3-2012-final.pdf  &gt; GENDER Male &gt; AGE 20-29 &gt; WORK VALUES &gt; &gt; Takes pride in his work &gt; &gt; LIFE VALUES &gt; &gt; Freedom of speech, lack of censorship, individuality, free flow of information, creativity and innovation, human rights and humanity, beautiful design, the environment &gt; &gt; PASSIONATE ABOUT &gt; &gt; Fighting corruption, politics, ending poverty, corporate greed &gt; &gt; CONCERNED ABOUT &gt; &gt; Lack of empathy, selfishness, global warming, unethical practices, ignorance, censorship &gt; &gt; COMPANY SIZE &gt; &gt; Almost 32% are independent developers, citing 1 employee in their company &gt; &gt; 31% work for companies with fewer than 10 employees &gt; &gt; 28% work for companies with between 11 and 999 employees &gt; &gt; 9% work for enterprises with more than 1,000 employees &gt; &gt;AGE &gt; &gt; 38.4% are in their 20s &gt; &gt; 79.2% are under the age of 40 &gt; &gt; GENDER &gt; &gt; 96% are male &gt; &gt; 4% are female  That sounds a lot like the Reddit demographic.",®

t5_2qh6c,ebookit,1350182624,"I agree I was working on a Christianity 2.0 ebook on that very notion that it needs to reinvent itself for the modern times.  My main point is that the New Testament was written for a first century world, and in many cased it has been mistranslated and we get stuff like this http://hotword.dictionary.com/catholic/ the words used in English Mass got changed recently. So the stuff I learned as a child, basically wasn't the actual words I should have been learning. It tells me we shouldn't have taken things so literally.  But anyway I wanted Christianity 2.0 to be a philosophical and critical thinking movement rather than a religious one. I wanted to reach out to non-Christians that way. Maybe I shouldn't even call it Christianity 2.0 at all but something else. I just needed a name for a working title, I can change it later.  Problem with Traditional Religion is they use the traditions of men rather than the traditions of God. That is where we get into trouble and it is the very thing Jesus taught against in his time.

t5_2qh1i,lydocia,1350201311,"My university college consisted of two departments: teacher training and engineering. I attended the former, my boyfriend the latter.   However, most facilities were in the engineering campus, so I had to go there for something (don't even remember what). I had an appointment, but this guy I needed to talk to was horrible with keeping to his schedule, so I had to wait outside for a really long while. Across the hall is the student council's office, with one guy sitting inside, looking really bored. He catches my eye, I catch his, and we start talking. Nope, not him. This guy? The most annoying person in the world, but he did play his part.  We started talking, and I remember one of my classmates saying ""I'm in the student council, it'd really be something for you, check it out!"". This guy starts telling me the same thing: ""we need people from the education department, so if you're interested..."" And you know what? I did it. Then and there, on the spot, decided I'd do something helpful for my department.   I attended the first meeting a week later. We would all go out for drinks and I decided that I'd talk to everyone for about ten minutes, so I'd all get to know them a little better. Being the only girl in the group, I did get a little bit attention  from everyone (""Woah, a girl gamer, woah, you like metal, music, woah!""), but I really cut down the conversations after ten or so minutes, moving onto the next person. This worked, for the first two people. The third one... not so much.  After almost two hours of being completely absorbed into each other and our conversation, we get a bit thirsty. We notice that most of our friends had moved to a different spot in the bar. We get drinks, join them again, find out they had tried to tell us but we were too occupied, started talking again. At the end of the evening, he walked me to the train. Twice. The first time, we missed it, so we went back to the bar and came back an hour later. Right before getting on the train, he asks me: ""Hey, wait - are you actually seeing someone?"" to which I respond ""no, I'm not..."". His reply? ""Excellent."" - right before the train door closes in between us. Most probably the most romantic moment in my life.  A little while later, we started dating and are still going strong over three years later.  Thank you, Sir, for being horrible with timetables; thank you, classmate, for telling me about the council; thank you, annoying boy, for convincing me to join up; thank you, sweetie, for being so wonderful. ♥  **TL;DR** I was late to the thread and even though my story may not be as special as the others here, it's still the best story of my life.",♥

About two years ago, I was coming back home from a family get together that happened in Mexico. As I was driving to start making line on the bridge, I was jamming to Linkin Park (♥) in my car. Then something caught my attention on my right. There was a truck driving next to me, same speed, with the windows up, pitch black. The guy driving the truck put some type of police lights on me and made me pull over. A thin guy carrying an M16 got off the passenger seat of the truck, and aimed at me while telling me to put my hands up, get off the car, and asked me questions about myself. I thought I was going to die in that moment, but no. I get off my car, and put my hands on the back of my car. Someone started frisking me, looking for my ID while four guys searched my car and other eight (two behind me) from a Dodge Durango behind my car aimed at me, all wearing ski masks and carrying rifles. One of the guys behind me took my walled and was looking for my ID, he asked me to show it to him because he couldn't find it. As I turn back from giving him my ID, the other man behind me laid the barrel of his rifle on the back of my head. You all have heard that you see your life flashing before your eyes when you're about to die? well, that's true.

Then he broke it in pieces and gave it to the disciples, saying, ""This is my body, which is given for you. Do this to remember me.""

t5_2qh2p,Smashley_pants,1350307874,"I grew up with a Catholicism on my mom side. My grandmother went to catholic school, my mom and her siblings did and so on. My dad just went along with it and talking to him now I realized he is athethist.( Theyare divorced now) Anyway my mom wanted to bring me up with the values that she had and so we want to church weekly, taught Sunday school etc. she always said she would supply me with what she was taught but once I turned 18 I could make my own decisions on reigion and if I wanted to continue on the catholic path.  By 8th grade I began questioning things but kept going to church  because my mom made me. I slowly learned about history and delevoped my own since of morales that the church did not agree with. I was lost for a while, after all my religion was ingrained in me and the idea of death being the end was the most difficult hurdle for me to jump but nothing they had taught me for 18 years made any sense especially when compared to science, history and the people who would be considered sinners were some of my closest friends. I'm 27 now and at this point in my life I can't remember the last time went to church, this upset my grandmother the most. Talking to my mom now about church, I don't think she believes it either. Since her kids grew up she does not partake in any religion.....well besides Christmas and Easter like any good catholic.😄",😄

t5_2r9vp,Tyrant718,1350309291,"Just some quick things I want to note because you pretty much lack intellect. That was a rap forum and I don't think you go on there daily, you just pulled that out your ass. Ticket master are not the comedian community you spoke of so more bullshit from you. You could have mentioned a comic I don't know and I might have, oh I dot know it's the Internet I would have looked him up. You again lack intellect or twisting my words around or you don't get the analogies I use. I don't listen to pop music or read twilight I was using that crowd to prove a point but I see that went over your head or you just wanted to miss that whole point I made. You lie like Romeny twisting words around and speaking on a subject that you obviously don't know and possibly I don't think you get. The suit I was talking about is an analogy. Why would I use it because I speak on something I know and have to in a way ""dumb it down"" for you to get and it's obvious now you don't know about urban comedy. Katt is an urban comic and just because you don't get his culture that he makes fun of doesn't make him a bad comic and never have I said anything bad about another comic or even named them. I'm defending him so it's in your mind if you like to come to a website and lie about what you do that's you. Why would I make fun or criticize you? I have nothing to gain from that and even if I think you suck I would keep it to myself and give you tips to help you. This is r/trees I don't come here to hate on others but you seem delusional about this. I don't like a lot of stuff here on r/trees but I don't go into that post and point out in detail why i don't like something or why this is a bad show or a group of people I don't like, like you have done then lie about being a comedian. That's stupid. Katts a stereotype of what? His environment like I said he's a product of or just like any comic today. Do you go on stage and people say ""yeah he's a stereotypical white guy."" no and that comment about hoes, rap videos and midget pimp is the equivalent to George Carlin ""cheese tits"". It's all to lure you to the greater point the comic was pointing out.  I read what you wrote and pretty summed up what kind of person you are just like detectives do when they are trying to find a killer, you see what they left behind and evaluate it based on the info you have. You again take things in the wrong light or just want to lack understanding. I don't think I was funny when replying to you do why would you assume I didn't think you was a comic based on you wasn't funny replying to me? That's ignorant. I didn't ask for a video of people you worked with that says Katt is a not a very good comic I asked of a video of you and your stand up and I made that clear. This comedy community you speak of must be a few up and coming comics that have their own views on things and must not be that big and that does not mean that's the comedy community that's your own local community.  Edit: sorry for editing so much but I would have used the enter key more but now that I know it's a burden to you I won't use it often have fun digging 😄 this is r/trees, take that negativity somewhere else and use this rule when on r/trees ""If you don't have nothing nice to say, keep it to yourself."" I really think you replying to a post going into detail then lie about your profession that I found out is now more of a hobby of yours and talk about how you don't like someone is really retarded.

Ultimate Rewards are very flexible - best redemption is transferring to Hyatt for hotels or Avios for flights (depending on where you are flying - Avios is part of oneworld, so you can fly on any oneworld airline with these points).  Citi Aadvantage (Both Amex and Visa) - Will post the link to this deal later. Not publicized anymore, but links still active IIRC.

Makes up for the annual fee (Can be of any value) Several (1 or 2 per card IIRC) free airline club passes Free Priority boarding, free 1st checked bag for you and 4 others  TL/DR: Use to meet minimum spend and to buy AA tickets. Close one of the two before the year anniversary.  Chase Hyatt Visa - To get the deal below, go on Chase's site and try to make reservations, on the confirmation page (before you input any personal data), you'll see a link to the deal with the statement credit.

You weren't trying to have a discussion, you were trying to prove your own agenda and bring excuses on behalf of Nintendo for their incredibly lousy coverage of the Wii U, for their repeated-examples of miscommunications and their lackluster first-party launch lineup.  I was never once trying to prove my own agenda. I was simply saying how, in my opinion, Nintendo hasn't had lousy coverage of the Wii U and their first-part line up isn't lackluster. I've never stated my opinion as fact, even if you assume I did.   &gt;You defend Nintendo after a user complains about being on a wait list for months to access their forums, which is bullshit.  That forum is NeoGAF, which is considered the best **gaming**, not Nintendo, forum on the internet. From my understanding, it takes a few months to post on the forum since they want to weed out idiots and trolls.

Well your definition of maturity means going through my comment history and just flaming me, then yes, you are mature.  And no, I don't think Nintendo is perfect like you seem to think I believe. This part year NOA has done a poor job localizing titles which I've called them out on several times, their main E3 conference was bad, and I thought NSMB 2 was an, although fun, rehash of the original title. But for their major games, they rarely screw up and put a ton of effort into. Kid Icarus Uprising was jam packed with content, which took me over 200+ hours to complete and I'm still playing the game due to how fun it is. If that isn't an example of great effort made into a game then I don't know what is   &gt;If this is the Nintendo you want, then you're not a fan of Nintendo's intellectual properties, you're just a fan of the company.

t5_2qhbp,kak0,1350346978,"It does not rely exclusively on the quran for proof. The trick is in the re assignment of ""khimar"" from cover to ""head cover"", which is an old trick.  The author0 ( edit: fixed) glosses quickly over the key question of what the khimar is. And gives a nice drawing of khimar to make it look official.  &gt;  The key is to note that the women at the time of jahiliya (pre-Islamic times) were already covering their hair, as was customary throughout history in various cultures6 and religions7 .  However, by letting the ends of their khimar hang down behind their back; their ears, neck, and chest were exposed89 .  This style can be seen in the image below10 .  The references he gives  are:  &gt; 6: See What People Wore When: A Complete Illustrated History of Costume, St. Martin’s Griffin, New York, 2008 [↩]  &gt; 7: See www.Catholicplanet.com/veil/index.htm [↩]  &gt; ...   &gt; 10: History of Costume, by Braun and Schneider [↩]  These are not serious references. I mean sure I can find references in which historical women cover their hair, but I can also find references in which middle eastern women walked around topless ( this was the case apparently until last century in upper egypt among other places).  You can see this in hadith and islamic historical literature which talks about women walking around topless, even though the scholars have tried to suppress this info.  Clothing has been an expensive item for most of human history. We still have people who cannot afford to buy clothes so their children run around without clothes in places close to my father's birthplace. And this is after industrialization has reduced the price of clothes by a factor of 100 or more.  In the time of the rasool the clothes were very expensive. And most poor went around in rags.  That's why clothing the poor was one major item of charity prescribed by islam. ",↩

t5_2qh1u,Iain_Angus_MacGregor,1350367506,"Islamic Art Project   Repeatedly our intellectual betters  assure us that such works as Andres Serrano’s prize winning Piss Christ  which portrayed a crucifix submerged in urine, and Chris Orfili’s Turner Prize winning work The Virgin Mary which, using elephant dung as a medium,  portrays the Mother of Jesus, are examples of western postmodern art which most of us are just too unsophisticated to appreciate.   To honor these modern artists and critics, in the spirit of ecumenism and to reach out to our fellows who follow the Religion of Peace, I offer a modest proposal.  But first -   We are told that the signature, the mark of great art, is that it produces strong emotions.  The following activities may be emotionally evocative for some demographic groups and thus produce strong emotional response.  We can characterize the activities resulting from exposure to these activities as Performance Art.     The geographical area historically called Arabia is now prefixed by the family name of the bin Saud clan; hence Saudi Arabia.  The Saudis, a gang of barbarian thugs and assassins, seized control of most of the Arabian Peninsula in the early 20th century.    The flag of Saudi Arabia is a green field on which is printed in Arabic script the Shahadah, the Islamic declaration of faith.  Beneath the Shahadah is depicted a scimitar, symbolizing the Islamic imperative to convert the world entire to Islam, by the sword if necessary.    A word about the Shahadah:  It is the cornerstone of the Mohamedan faith, referred to by its devotees as Islam.  It is found in the Koran  (surah 3 Ali Imran verse 18).  It is usually construed in English as “There is no God but Allah  and Mohammad  is His Prophet.”  This is the verse one is required to recite before Muslim witnesses as a token of conversion to Islam and proof of insanity.  Your Very Own Islamic Performance Art Project    Photoshop© the flag of Arabia.  Remove the scimitar; convert the green background to white and the yellow lettering to black.    This venue will not allow entering the result. Look it up.  Next step – Print them out 20 or so at a time on a single sheet of paper, then separate them into individual strips of paper.  They might somewhat resemble what you would find in a fortune cookie.  Printing them on self adhesive label paper is another option.    Now for the Performance Art.      Suppose you are at the cinema, and were to (discreetly) drop one of these into a urinal, printed side up.  Suppose further Mr. Hypothetical Muslim enters the lavatory in urgent need to void his bladder.  He (or she in altered circumstances) sees the printed Shahida, the central statement the Mohamedan faith, lying there with other rubbish - discarded chewing gum, cigarette butts – the usual.  If our Performing Artist doesn’t see it, or pretends not to see it and continues the natural process, he is:   •  Pissing on the name of the Islamic deity, Allah. •  Pissing on the name of the so-called prophet, Mohamed.   •  Pissing on the most central of Koranic verses and thereby, symbolically, on the Koran.     In the aggregate he is pissing on all Islam.   Here, boys and girls, is the beginning of The Performance.  Artistic sensibility suggests the title of the Performance:  “What to do?”    “What to do?”    Does he reach into the urinal to rescue his precious holy verse?  What then?   Perhaps he’ll find a sink so he can rinse it off and put it in his pocket while trying not to wet himself.  Suppose he sees one or two of these printed verses in each urinal as traffic briskly enters the lavatory for the same purpose as he?  Will he try to stop the infidels whose necessity is as great as his?  (Instead of the Shahadah verse simply being dropped into the urinal, an Artist could use an adhesive label to affix the Shahadah to the porcelain in the target area.)    *The Performance.* Perhaps he will dance around while holding his legs together, his bladder and his head threatening to explode.  Will he pretend he sees nothing, or will he attempt to prevent everyone from seeking relief?     Guys.  If you were minding your own business, trying to whiz, and some guy forcefully tried to stop you, how would you respond?    “What to do?”  Right.  Dirty filthy kaffirs, infidels, unbelievers are about to piss on everything Mr. Hypothetical Muslim holds most sacred:  Allah, Mohamed, and the Koran – All of Islam.  How is he going to prevent it?  That will be a Performance.  It will be even better if the infidels recognize the situation, take careful aim and laugh as Mr. Hypothetical Muslim watches.  BUT: Remember Andres Serrano.  This is ART.  The Tate tells us it is Art with a capital A.  Who are we to dispute these Intellectuals who represent the epitome of Class, of Culture? of Civilized Values?  We are indebted to them for showing us the Socialist Soul of the Labour Party.   “What to do?”  Now, through the loo to the stalls.  An unflushed commode is less disgusting than Gordon Brown.  Nevertheless, suppose that after using the commode one were to leave one or two verses on top of the unflushed deposit?  Would Mr. Hypothetical Muslim pretend not to see, and flush it with the rest of the sewage, or mount a rescue?  Ewwwww.  Either way, another Art Performance ensues.  (I am not obsessed with the Koran or with fecal matter.  It merely seems the two naturally go together.)  Alternatively, there are opportunities here for the verse printed on sticky-backed label paper…  “What to do?”  Not wanting to offend ecological sensibilities, little printed copies of the Shahadah printed on both sides of the paper offer additional Performance Art possibilities.  You will, I am sure, originate some of your own.  A verse pasted to the end of a toothpick makes a bonny wee flag such as used to mark the summit of a hot steaming pile of something a dog or horse left behind.  For whatever reason, the bottoms of shoes are anathema to many Muslims.  Performance Art might be occasioned by dropping these verses on streets, sidewalks, roads and paths where people, horses, dogs, bicycles and traffic can tread on, drive on and otherwise grind them into the filth.    “What to do?”  Using labels, sticky tape or by using the Shahadah to create a stencil, place the verse onto doormats, floor mats in vehicles, stairways, elevator floors, escalator steps – anywhere people walk or sit.  Place a verse where one’s bum meets the park bench, on beer coasters in pubs, visible in or on dust bins (garbage receptacles) or on the bottom of bird cages in pet stores.  There are many other artistic opportunities to be found in the lavatories of airplanes, busses, trains and trams, and on the bottoms of shoes…  If Mr. Hypothetical Muslim in Durkadurkastan hears from his local BBC Arts and Letters Radio equivalent that an Art Project has directed some small attention towards Islam, he should be pleased.  If he is not entirely gratified by the form of presentation he will write a politely worded letter to the Guardian or the BBC Comments web page explaining his objections.  That is the way things are done in the polite, civilized Islamic world that we have all come to know, love, respect and admire.    Remember, all this effort is for the sake of Art.  We do it to show our Islamic brothers and sisters that we have the same respect for the Islamic faith as its adherents have historically shown to creeds other than their particular flavour of Islam.  It is an artistic presentation of the Karmic wheel:  “What goes around, comes around.”     Peace   END NOTES  --------------------------------------------------    Lady Lynn Forester de Rothschild, James M Allwin, Frances Bowes, Henry Christensen III, Ella Fontanals Cisneros, Jeanne Donovan Fisher, Sandra Niles and Professor Allen Staley might be examples.

t5_2sc5r,DoorIntoSummer,1350383566,"There is also: “*No man is an island, entire of itself; every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main. If a clod be washed away by the sea, Europe is the less, as well as if a promontory were, as well as if a manor of thy friend's or of thine own were: any man's death diminishes me, because I am involved in mankind, and therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee.*” — though even this I take out of context, unfortunately, —originally it all is being based around the concepts of God and immortal soul of Catholicism.  Thank you for spending your time for a so detailed summation. I wish I could synthesize information like that.   &gt;However, I think you're referring more to a collective consciousness is the sense of a cosmic consciousness.  ↕  &gt;[..](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_consciousness) the average, ordinary human being is only partially conscious due to the character of the untrained mind and the influence of 'lower' impulses and preoccupations. As a result, most humans are considered to be asleep (to reality) even as they go about their daily business. Gurdjieff called this ordinary condition of humanity ""waking sleep,"" an idea gleaned in part from ancient spiritual teachings such as those of the Buddha. In each person lie potentialities that remain inchoate as a result of the individual being caught up in mechanical, neurotic modes of behaviour where energy for personal spiritual development is not used effectively nor efficiently, but squandered in unskillful ways. ..  While I am not rejecting the possibility of this and the potential usefulness of this, this is not what I am looking for right now. The majority of quotes that you’ve referenced to are also too vague or too abstract (operate on the grand scale level of things, which is not too useful for me as for an individual with a lifespan of some 50-100 years).   I guess I posted this question to philosophy instead of book recommendations because I was looking for a set of principles that can be used in everyday life to build a social structure with the idea of unanimous group consciousness which is being separated from itself by some cognitive&amp;psychological illusions and by our distorted perception of [our organism\organisms of others]. *This* is also where the problem of conflicting interests becomes important, because if you only adjust your views to see others as an extension of yourself, you’ll eventually become a resource supply source for others on your own expenses (ultimate example being giving all your property to others and becoming poor yourself). The ethical system should address such problems and give at least some discussion about how it can be solved.  I don’t know how much sense this description makes, but I’ll stop here so far because I am not sure if you are interested in listening all this either.  In any case, as I said, I am thankful to you for caring and composing a reply of such a length — some quotes (about 8-10 if to be more exact) I did find resonating with me, so I’ll be able to use them as reference point later on to decide which authors works to read next.

t5_2setk,tahninial,1350384121,"I started White 2 on Sunday evening and was playing normally but got kinda bored before the first gym playing my normal try-and-catch-everything way so I decided to start again as a Nuzlocke as I thought it might help control what I was doing and also because this is the only chance for a while I will get to play a storyline blind.  Having seen grass and water types would potentially be available, this time I picked a lovely little Tepig called Rasher and (as you can see) Oshawott tackled him to death. Skipped right over the tail whips (or growl, is it?) and critical hit me all the way into an early defeat.  But the story doesn't end there. I started again and got a female Tepig which I called Streaky. Full team details below:  ---  **Streaky (Tepig ♀)**  Level 10  Lax Nature  Asperia City  Named because bacon  ---  **Mr. Susan (Purrloin ♀)**  Level 10  Lax Nature  Route 19  Named after a female cat I knew, named after a Mighty Boosh character  ---  **Salad (Sewaddle ♀)**  Level 11  Quirky Nature  Route 20  Named because she's leafy!  ---  **Fletcher (Lillipup ♀)**  Level 10  Gentle Nature  Floccesy Ranch  Named after Jessica Fletcher (MUrder She Wrote) due to Odor Sleuth  ---  There I go into the first gym, up against the last Pokémon, a Lillipup. No problems thus far at all. Lillipup uses Work Up and then procedes to OHKO every single member of my team with Tackle. Seriously WTF.  Maybe I was under levelled, I partly had no patience for grinding with the level-based EXP system and no Audino (because I was doing it closed-book I didn't realise until Googling it this morning that Audino apparently *does* appear in routes before the first gym and I somehow just hadn't noticed any when I tried in my first play through).   Still, I never thought it would be such a bitch to start with!  Thinking I would get a few gyms under my belt before I lost, I expected I would play uintil I lost then finish the story as normal but since I didn't get very far I'm toying with the idea of resurrecting everyone and doing the gym again and continuing on my Nuzlocke. Even though I was only an hour in, I don't have starting again in me...  Thoughts?  Edit: Also are people doing anything interesting (if anything at all) with B2W2 Nuzlockes and Dream Radar / Dream World Pokémon?  **TLDR: Got killed by Hugh in first battle, then one Lillipup in the first Gym swept my team. What do I do now?** ",♀

There are three events coming up for this Questcor:  1.  Aetna revision/update on coverage policy (Originally Oct 13, but so far no update, can come any day now).  2. Earnings on Oct 23 (paid prescription are up 15-16% this QoQ).  Street consensus on of $0.77 EPS.  I'm thinking a surprise of 1-3 cents based on the 8k report.  3.  Kidney Week starting October 30, Nephrotic syndrome (NS) scripts are A LOT more valuable than MS.  There are several abstracts for Kidney Week that mentions H.P. Acthar® Gel.  It takes 7 vials for each NS patient as opposed to 2 for MS.  Each script for NS is 3.5x compared to each MS script.  The exposure of H.P. Acthar® Gel at Kidney Week is the best kind of marketing paired with favorable study results that can really push NS scripts into the stratosphere.  Again this is a bit of a speculative play.

t5_2rbfw,forgeddit,1350481181,"Both (q∨¬q) and (q↔q) are equivalent to ⊤.  They are tautologies.  You can figure this out yourself either by truth table or just looking at what they're actually saying: (q∨¬q) is ""q is true or q is not true"" or just ""q is either true or false"",  and (q↔q) is ""q is true if and only if q is true"" or just ""q equals q"".  Both are obviously true no matter what q is.  Personally I wouldn't give any answer for h₁(q) or h₂(q) in a form other than ""⊤"", ""q"", ""¬q"", or ""⊥"".  Anything else is a more complicated way of writing the same thing.  (Note that only two of those are correct answers, of course.)    In my view writing something like h(q)=(q↔q) instead of h(q)=⊤ would be like writing ""f(x)=x+3-x"" instead of ""f(x)=3"".  Sure, you can do it, but why?  ",↔

t5_2s960,Smallpaul,1350553218,"&gt; Capitalism is still organized crime, in the literal sense of the word. More organized than any other in the world.  Capitalism is extremely organized. But it is only metaphorically criminal, not literal. Capitalists work in the open because society appreciates their contribution and provides it legal protection, even if you and I disagree. Any politician who came out as anti-capitalist would lose an election EVEN IF the capitalists did not spend money on campaign ads against them. The statement itself would shock and offend 80% of society. So when you say it is criminal, you mean either ""Some small subset of capitalists are literally criminal"" or ""most capitalists are metaphorically criminal according to the values that we hold.""  &gt; The only difference is that capitalism has more tact - of course they don't outright murder their enemies, because that would cause unwanted attention and would actually allow the people to point and scream in outrage. They know of smarter, more efficient ways to silence their adversaries.  They are not at all consistently successful at silencing their adversaries. This is what a pack of cigarrettes looks like in Canada now:   * http://www.smoke-free.ca/warnings/canada-warnings.htm  GreenPeace has succeeded in ending the whaling practice worldwide.  Consider what's going on in these cases:   * http://whistleblower.labovick.com/articles/whistleblower-articles/health-care-fraud/pharmaceutical/  &gt; &gt; Whistleblowers are fired, not killed.  &gt; Whistleblowers are sentenced to solitary confinement without trial.   We are talking about capitalism, not militaristic imperialism. Here's what happens to whistleblowers who work for capitalist enterprises:   * ""American pharmaceutical manufacturer Allergan Inc. has agreed to plead guilty and pay $600 million fine. This will resolve Allergan's criminal and civil liability arising from the unlawful promotion of Botox® Therapeutic, ... The civil settlement resolves three lawsuits filed in federal court in the Northern District of Georgia under the qui tam, or whistleblower, provisions of the False Claims Act, which allow private citizens to bring civil actions on behalf of the United States and share in any recovery. The following whistleblowers – Dr. Amy Lang, Charles Rushin, Cher Beilfuss, Kathleen O'Conner-Masse, and Edward Hallivis – will receive $37.8 million from the federal share of the settlement amount.""  I know that our ""old system"" has not yet gone completely awry when I see that private individuals can take on mega-corps *and be rewarded for it*. I think that's great and it shows how much hard work has been poured into a semblance of democracy and equality under the current system.  &gt; Again, it's not so much about the methods involved - just because they didn't kill Bradley Manning doesn't put them on any higher ground than criminals.  Ummm....what moral system are you using where imprisoning someone temporarily does not put you ""on a higher ground"" than someone who kills them? According to my own moral compass, there is a significant difference there.  &gt;... It's insightful because in the same breath that our leaders condemn these criminal vermin, they are the ones reinforcing their behavior - an upstanding role model for the criminal industry. That's how you do crime right, they all think.  If capitalist enterprise is ""the way to do crime right"" then mafiosos should just become capitalists. There is nothing stopping them. But it is a lot harder to produce a product or a service than to stick a gun in someone's mouth and ask them to give you money.  &gt; ... I feel the capitalists would be the only ones still advancing criminal operations.  To be honest, that sounds bizarre and a bit utopian to me.  Where would the mafioso go? Do you realize that gangs of armed bandits long predate ""capitalism""? Are you saying that nobody would stumble upon the idea of violent gangs in an anarchist society? That the existing violent gangs would just dissipate like magic?  ",®

If you use shapes the player is used to seeing all the time (rather than shapes unique to your game), it takes less brain-power to distinguish them, and the player has an easier time.  As for colors, [this](http://jfly.iam.u-tokyo.ac.jp/color/) is a great place to start. But, since you only need 4 distinct colors for the 4 powerups:   Vermillion, Blue, Yellow, White. This will work across the widest range of colorblindness.  Or, if you're counting Health and Boost, substitute Orange for Vermillion, and use Vermillion Hearts for Health (fairly universal). Then substitute Sky Blue for White and use White Xs for Offensive Boost ('X' for multiplication?).

t5_2qjhk,dreamsplease,1350620289,"I just got off the phone with Paypal and they were very persistent on saying that they would NOT be able to get the money back for these transactions, and giving it back to them would be at our discretion. Once the transaction is marked ""completed"", there is no ability to refund the money. I'd assume if you don't have a billing agreement you are good to go.  Edit: I was very clear with the tech on the phone what had happened. She understood that the transactions were sent by Bilzzard, and that Blizzard sent me an email saying they were going to be taking it back. I asked if they would be able to get the money back without a billing agreement, and she very explicitly said no. I pressed her on it, and she got annoyed to the point of saying something along the lines of ""They cannot do that sir, that is not how PayPal works"". I said, ""So you guys record these calls, and if they are able to take the money out of my account I can call back here and dispute it right?"", and she was very persistent that not only would it not be my problem, but that it would never happen. She even sent me this email:  I realize the email confuses the issue, but she was just sending me something related to cancelling sending money. I made it extremely clear what had happened, and I made no claim that the money was something I ""deserved"" or that it was payment for an item I sent. I very clearly stated that the money wasn't sent on purpose, and that they were asking for it back. She told me that it was at my discretion as to whether or not I wanted to give them anything.

t5_2r9po,Acromir,1350660118,"I actually have some copypasta for when people ask about my build. Here you go!  ###Traits  ##Shadow Arts (25) * 2♦ when you stealth * +1s Stealth duration * AoE Blind on stealth * 2 stacks of Might (15s) on stealth  ##Acrobatics (20) * Might (15s) on dodge * Swiftness (2s) on dodge * Healing when you spend initiative * 15 endurance returned after dodging  ##Trickery (25) * Fury, Might, and Swiftness (10s) on Steal * Vigor (15s) and two boons stolen on Steal * +3 max initiative. * +1% damage per initiative  ###Weapons  ##Sword/Dagger  This is the weapon I use almost all the time. The spam attack does the exact same damage as the dagger spam attack, but it has a cripple/weakness and it's a frontal AOE. Infiltrator's Strike is the world's best stun break. It breaks stuns, moves you out of danger, and removes a condition as a bonus. It's spammable, which is unique to us. Always have a Shadow Return available. Stuns never last more than half a second on me. Flanking Strike is meh, and only gets very rare use to remove a boon.  Dancing Dagger is a great cripple, and actually does decent AoE damage. Cloak and Dagger is central to this build. I use CnD -&gt; Tactical Strike for a daze frequently. I average a 2s daze every 5-6s. This is a great deal of support for the group, and extremely powerful in PvP. CnD actually does great damage, and Tactical Strike deals slightly more than a #1 attack. Additionally, this works well with the trait that heals when you spend initiative. It heals you as if you use 5♦ (which means 300-500 health), but only costs 3♦ with the initiative return.  ##Shortbow  90% of the time I use this weapon is in a large-scale DE (or just shadowstepping to cover ground). It has great AoE and it's ranged, so it's perfect for dancing around the outside of a large fight. This is also good for the rare occasion that I have to kite something.  ###Skills  ##Hide in Shadows  I pick this as my heal almost all the time. Withdraw heals for more, but I hate having to give up my positioning. The 4s stealth is great, and the 2♦ is a bonus. I also love the condition removal, and the regen is made more powerful by my focus on boon duration.  ##Blinding Powder  Another AoE stealth for aggro control or a revive. Also useful to restore initiative or get off a stun when I don't have time to cast C&amp;D. An instant aggro-drop panic button that even works while you're stunned.  ##Shadow refuge  It's a great defensive and support tool. Can be used for an easy revive, or to heal your allies. It's also a great aggro control, which is something that only Thieves and Mesmers can do. All kinds of other uses, like ambushing in WvW or harvesting a node surrounded by enemies. Thanks to my traits, this gives me 8 initiative, and if I stand in it for the full duration I'll get 12 stacks of might.  ##Scorpion Wire  I usually use Scorpion Wire here. It's nice to have a fast interrupt, and the pull/knockdown is a great control. I'll often immediately follow up with Cloak and Dagger, which is a near-guaranteed hit.  However, I'll replace this skill as the situation warrants. Smoke Screen, Caltrops, Shadowstep, Skale Venom, Role for Initiative, and Haste all find their way into this slot at one time or another.  ##Elite  I go for Dagger Storm, because it can do all kinds of neat things. It's a great burst of AoE damage, it's a huge projectile reflector, and it gives you 11s of stability. Just keep in mind that you don't have to cast the whole thing. I'll frequently only use this for a couple of seconds and then dodge out of it, unless I'm able to kite them around or I'm fighting people who only use projectiles.  ###Gear  ##Stats  This is a power-heavy build, although I get a decent amount of crit chance/damage. I use some vit/toughness, but a big part of my defense comes from dodging, stealth, and CC so it's not that important. Condition damage is a low priority, as my main weapon set doesn't have any damaging conditions. I pick up a little bit for Caltrops and Shortbow, though.  ##Runes I go with two Runes of the Water and two Runes of the Monk. Those each give +15% boon duration, which is a huge bonus both to me solo and to my group support ability. Right now, I'm using two Runes of the Hoelbrak for my last two, which gives +20% might duration for even more might stacking.  ##Sigils I go with a Sigil of Fire, which has a chance to trigger an AoE flame blast on crit. The flame blast triggers a minimum of once a fight, and often several times. It does surprisingly high damage and is very useful. My dagger has a Sigil of Force for an easy +5% damage.  ##Food  I go with Chocolate Omnomberry Cream. +40% magic find, and +20% boon duration. For a boon-heavy build, that's all-around epic, and the MF is just a nice bonus. I'll occasionally use a heal-on-crit food if I'm having trouble staying up.  ###Play Style  ##Damage  This build does good sustained damage, especially AoE. I get a good passive damage bonus (~10%) from initiative. With might from dodging and stealth, I always have 10+ stacks of might up. I get 58% fury uptime from Steal, which is great and meshes with my Sigil of Fire. My spike damage does not exist, and I'll never compare to the damage of a glass-cannon build, especially against a single target. However, I have good sustained single-target, and strong AoE damage. My damage is more than enough for a build with so much defense, control, and support.  ##Defenses  I never get hit. If the enemy can uncross their eyes long enough to take a swing at me, I'm either in stealth or I dodge every attack. I stealth frequently, which causes an AoE blind and lets me use a 2s daze. I almost instantly break every stun on me, so good luck trying to control me. This build excels against the CC/Burst noobs in PvP. Charge -&gt; Frenzy -&gt; Hundred Blades warriors get destroyed by this build. As soon as they knock me down, I break it and Shadow Return away. Then I stealth, dodge-roll towards them, and stun them for the rest of their Frenzy. Those one-trick-ponies melt if you can counter their one trick.  Defense is very active, and very fun. You go down fast if you take a lot of hits, but you can heal yourself up very well and you have all kinds of methods to keep from getting hit. You can dodge every 3s with perma-Vigor and the endurance return, and get constant healing every time you spend initiative.  ##Support  The backbone of my support is the boons I grant from Steal. In PvP (no food) that's 16s of fury and swiftness, 18s of might, 24s of vigor, and two stolen boons to everyone near me. In PvE, I get another 20% duration from foods (total of +80% boon duration!). I also get tons of control, and active aggro control or revives with stealth is awesome. I frequently AoE blind while fighting, which helps keep my group alive.  ##Mobility  The mobility this build offers is great. You can get 100% uptime with swiftness. Combine that with Infiltrator's Arrow, and I can cover ground faster than any other class/spec. Combine *that* with stealth, and I rarely die because of all my escape tools. PROTIP: If you're just covering ground, use steal on a white-name enemy. It'll give you vigor (which requires you to successfully steal, unlike the fury/might/swiftness), but won't put you in combat.",♦

t5_2qpzs,evencorey,1350662724,"I don't know how if this would help, but I just read this and I think it could belong here. Its copied and pasted from Facebook. Source unknown. It made me cry.  Wanna kill yourself? Imagine this. You come home from school one day. You’ve had yet another horrible day. You’re just ready to give up. So you go to your room, close the door, and take out that suicide note you’ve written and rewritten over and over and over You take out those razor blades, and cut for the very last time. You grab that bottle of pills and take them all. Laying down, holding the letter to your chest, you close your eyes for the very last time. A few hours later, your little brother knocks on your door to come tell you dinners ready. You don’t answer, so he walks in. All he sees is you laying on your bed, so he thinks you’re asleep. He tells your mom this. Your mom goes to your room to wake you up. She notices something is odd. She grabs the paper in your hand and reads it. Sobbing, she tries to wake you up. She’s screaming your name. Your brother, so confused, runs to go tell Dad that “Mommy is crying and sissy won’t wake up.” Your dad runs to your room. He looks at your mom, crying, holding the letter to her chest, sitting next to your lifeless body. It hits him, what’s going on, and he screams. He screams and throws something at the wall. And then, falling to his knees, he starts to cry. Your mom crawls over to him, and they sit there, holding each other, crying. The next day at school, there’s an announcement. The principal tells everyone about your suicide. It takes a few seconds for it to sink in, and once it does, everyone goes silent. Everyone blames themselves. Your teachers think they were too hard on you. Those mean popular girls, they think of all the things they’ve said to you. That boy that used to tease you and call you names, he can’t help but hate himself for never telling you how beautiful you really are. Your ex boyfriend, the one that you told everything to, that broke up with you.. He can’t handle it. He breaks down and starts crying, and runs out of the school. Your friends? They’re sobbing too, wondering how they could never see that anything was wrong, wishing they could have helped you before it was too late. And your best friend? She’s in shock. She can’t believe it. She knew what you were going through, but she never thought it would get that bad… Bad enough for you to end it. She can’t cry, she can’t feel anything. She stands up, walks out of the classroom, and just sinks to the floor. Shaking, screaming, but no tears coming out. It’s a few days later, at your funeral. The whole town came. Everyone knew you, that girl with the bright smile and bubbly personality. The one that was always there for them, the shoulder to cry on. Lots of people talk about all the good memories they had with you, there were a lot. Everyone’s crying, your little brother still doesn’t know you killed yourself, he’s too young. Your parents just said you died. It hurts him, a lot. You were his big sister, you were supposed to always be there for him. Your best friend, she stays strong through the entire service, but as soon as they start lowering your casket into the ground, she just loses it. She cries and cries and doesn’t stop for days. It’s two years later. The whole school talks to a counselor/therapist at least once a week. Your teachers all quit their job. Those mean girls have eating disorders now. That boy that used to tease you cuts himself. Your ex boyfriend doesn’t know how to love anymore and just sleeps around with girls. Your friends all go into depression. Your best friend? She tried to kill herself. She didn’t succeed like you did, but she tried…your brother? He finally found out the truth about your death. He self harms, he cries at night, he does exactly what you did for years leading up to your suicide. Your parents? Their marriage fell apart. Your dad became a workaholic to distract himself from your death. Your mom got diagnosed with depression and just lays in bed all day. People care. You may not think so, but they do. Your choices don’t just effect you. They effect everyone. Don’t end your life, you have so much to live for. Things can’t get better if you give up. I’m here for absolutely anyone that needs to talk, no matter who you are. Even if we’ve NEVER talked before, I’m here for you. ♥ Copy and paste this as your status to show people there are people out there that care. Like this status if you read it",♥

Make sure you use a doctype, specify character encoding and stuff like that, otherwise you'll run into a LOT of problems down the line.  Ontopic - oh my gosh they are so pretty and neat. I can't stop clicking them.  I'll give you one tip to start, though - It also might save you a lot of time if you split up your styles. You can give divs as many classes as you like, so I would make a generic 'button' class that has styles for the shape and animation and stuff, and then another class that describes the button more specifically. So then your html would be like &lt;a class=""button submit""&gt;Submit&lt;/a&gt; or something, and your button would inherit styles from both of those classes.  In fact, [just look at selectors in general](http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/html-css-techniques/the-30-css-selectors-you-must-memorize). Even the fruity obscure ones. Selectors were pretty much the last thing in CSS that I really took the time to learn properly, and I totally wish they were the first. Good luck!

t5_2tkvu,DOUGUOD,1350685436,"As a mechanic, I found out over the years that cheap tools will let you know where to spend your money. Allow me to elaborate. I got started in high school, borrowed some money, and bought a massive set of Craftsman tools (back when they were worth a shit) from Sears. After I got started I quickly figured out what tools I liked and didn't like, what tools held up and what tools were just not gonna hack it. And as a general rule of thumb, the smaller the tool the better the quality needs to be.  Wrenches for example: A Craftsman 9/16 open ended wrench will stretch and round off the bolt. A 9/16 Snap-On Flank Drive wrench will bite the bolt and break it loose and does not stretch but if you push it hard enough, it'll snap. (I said snap...ha) Gearwrench ratchet wrenches have served me very well for a very long time and are reasonably priced. Don't waste your money on high quality big wrenches. An inch n' a half bolt head isn't exactly easy to round off and even if you manage to fuck it up, a bolt that size leaves you a lot of...options.  Ratchets: The big ones? Whatever. The 1/4"" got used a lot, it's quirks became frustration and thus replaced with a Snap-On. (Narrow body, locking flex head, love that little bastard) Same with the 3/8"" ratchet, went with a custom Snappy on that one.  Screwdrivers: The Whitte® ones are fucking sweet German made drivers (Matco sells them with their name on them also). Cheapos will get you by for a bit, but keep a spare #2 Phillips...and a standard flat spare also.  Hammers: Buy a good dead blow. Fuck spending tons of money on the rest of em'.  Pry bars: Bite the bullet on these ones. Because cheap bars suck ass. Period.  Sockets: I don't give a fuck what the Snap-On dealer says, a cheap set of impact sockets will do fine. The thin chrome sockets will rip or explode when you hit em' hard, impact sockets are thicker and made out of a softer steel to prevent this, thus cheap has served me really well.  All my chrome sockets are Craftsman still, although I'm looking at upgrading my 1/4"" set.  I may add more later if you want. My phone is about dead, so I gotta go...  ",®

t5_2qpp6,romaths,1350726520,yeah I would like the idea of replays to get casted ingame. Maybe you can tab between just replays and casted replays. In the casted replays you can choose a caster of all that cast the replay and watch it with his commentary.  It could also be included that progamers after a ladder game choose to host the replay so it appeares a replay and casters can choose to cast it.  when you watch a pro replay it could somewhere show there sponsors or if casted the sponsors of caster and gamer (obviously they can't show all at once but maybe they got like 4 spaces anywhere and you can manage if you either show always one sponsor or if you rotate..)  all in all there a so many ways of making something new happen they just have to pick one idea and make something. even though I love the game as it is as well I'm looking forward to every new feature like this that makes it in the game ♥,♥

I wrote that just for you ♥  &gt;&gt;So if I understand this right, the whole incident irrelevant and semantic bullshit, and Romney is just trying to squeeze out some political backing by making Obama seem weak on terror.   Er, sort of. There's a real issue (terrorists attacked an embassy), but it's difficult for Romney to attack it without looking like he's trying to exploit the deaths of Americans. The semantic stuff appeals to the fringier right because it's a conspiracy (""It was a coverup!"" or ""He doesn't want to say bad things about terrorists because he's Muslim!"", and the more mainstream conservative media has picked it up. For them, I imagine it's an excuse to talk about the Libya attacks WHICH KILLED AMERICANS UNDER OBAMA'S WATCH 'CAUSE HE'S A PUSSY ON TERROR, without explicitly saying all the caps-lock stuff there.

t5_2rf6a,jas7fc,1350803689,"The first claimed detection of mammalian endogenous DMT was published in June 1965: German researchers F. Franzen and H. Gross report to have evidenced and quantified DMT, along with its structural analog bufotenin (5-OH-DMT), in human blood and urine.[42] In an article published four months later, the method used in their study is strongly criticized, and credibility of their results challenged.[43]  In 2001, surveys, made in research articles, point that few of the analytical methods previously used to measure levels of endogenously formed DMT had enough sensitivity and selectivity to produce reliable results.[44][45] Gas chromatography, preferably coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS), is considered a minimum requirement.[45] A study published in 2005[28] implements the most sensitive and selective method ever used to measure endogenous DMT:[46] liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry with electrospray ionization (LC-ESI-MS/MS) allows to reach limits of detection (LODs) 12 to 200 fold lower (that is, better) than those attained by the best methods employed in the 1970s. The data summarized in the table below are from studies conforming to the abovementioned requirements (abbreviations used: CSF = cerebrospinal fluid; LOD = limit of detection; n = number of samples; ng/L and ng/kg = nanograms (10−9 g) per litre, and nanograms per kilogram, respectively): DMT in body fluids and tissues (NB: units have been harmonized) Species 	Sample 	Results Human 	Blood serum 	&lt; LOD (n = 66)[28] Blood plasma 	&lt; LOD (n = 71)[28]  ♦  &lt; LOD (n = 38); 1,000 &amp; 10,600 ng/L (n = 2)[47] Whole blood 	&lt; LOD (n = 20); 50–790 ng/L (n = 20)[48] Urine 	&lt; 100 ng/L (n = 9)[28]  ♦  &lt; LOD (n = 60); 160–540 ng/L (n = 5)[45]  ♦  Detected in n = 10 by GC-MS[49] Feces 	&lt; 50 ng/kg (n = 12); 130 ng/kg (n = 1)[28] Kidney 	15 ng/kg (n = 1)[28] Lung 	14 ng/kg (n = 1)[28] Lumbar CSF 	100,370 ng/L (n = 1); 2,330–7,210 ng/L (n = 3); 350 &amp; 850 ng/L (n = 2)[50] Rat 	Kidney 	12 &amp;16 ng/kg (n = 2)[28] Lung 	22 &amp; 12 ng/kg (n = 2)[28] Liver 	6 &amp; 10 ng/kg (n = 2)[28] Brain 	10 &amp;15 ng/kg (n = 2)[28]  ♦  Measured in synaptic vesicular fraction[51] Rabbit 	Liver 	&lt; 10 ng/kg (n = 1)[28]",♦

t5_2qh16,puppymeat,1350845282,"&gt;charge $35 to prove your innocence knowing many peoples gut reaction when being accused of something they didnt do..is to want to clear their names  You know the ISP doesn't profit from the $35 dollars, right?  Nor does the person who reports the IP.  I guess I should probably recap my last discussion I had with reddit about this.  &gt; Why do I have to pay someone to win?  Probably to discourage people from trying to flood the system with challenges when they are actually guilty but have little to lose by trying?  But I agree, it would also be acceptable to have the appeal free, but if you lose, pay a fee for wasting everyones time. ___ &gt; How long is that going to take?  I don't think this is known and is up to the individual ISP to determine. Based on some things you will learn below, it's in their best interest to do it promptly. ___ &gt; Are my services for the internet (That I am still paying for while this council is judging) still going to be affected?  Short answer, NO.  (More explanation provided in my next quote of you below.)  The first **FOUR** alerts you get about your copyright infringement have **NO CONSEQUENCES AT ALL** beyond being notified by your ISP that you are breaking the law.  On the fifth, the ISP has the option to affect your service in some way that does not involve shutting it off. From the pdf included in the article:  &gt; If, after these educational and acknowledgment alerts, the subscriber’s account  still appears to be engaged in content theft, the ISP will send yet another alert.  At  this time, **the ISP may take** one of several steps, referred to as “**Mitigation  Measures**” reasonably calculated to stop future content theft.  **These Mitigation  Measures may include**, for example: **temporary reductions of Internet speeds,  redirection to a landing page until the subscriber contacts the ISP to discuss the  matter or reviews and responds to some educational information about copyright**,  or other measures (as specified in published policies) that the ISP may deem  necessary to help resolve the matter.  **ISPs are not required to impose any  Mitigation Measure which would disable or be reasonably likely to disable the  subscriber’s voice telephone service (including the ability to call 911), e-mail  account, or any security or health service (such as home security or medical  monitoring). The ISP may also waive the Mitigation Measure.**  Also,  &gt;Is termination of the subscriber’s account part of this program?   &gt;• No.  This alert system does not, in any circumstance, require the ISP to terminate  a subscriber account   So if you don't want to have a reduction of service, resist the urge to pirate constantly after your fourth warning. This doesn't sound very difficult.  ___ &gt; Will they ""refund"" me for the lost services they enacted for punishment of something I didn't do?  This isn't even a valid concern. According to the document:  &gt;Under this system, **before a Mitigation Measure is imposed, a  subscriber may request independent review to invalidate the alert** and avoid any  Mitigation Measure on the basis that the online activity in question is lawful (e.g.  protected by fair use or authorized by the owner of the copyrighted material) or  that the subscriber’s account was identified in error.  So, as you can see, if you decide to challenge one of the notices, your service will not be altered until the ruling occurs. ___ &gt;Is there any incentive for them to not find me guilty?  There is no incentive whatsoever.  The cable company does not do the ruling. It is done by a non partial third party. &gt;A qualified, independent entity, separate from the Center for Copyright  Information, will be engaged to establish and operate the Independent Review  mechanism.   Just to be clear, the independent entity will be paid either way, so it's not in their best interest to rule you as guilty.  If you're guilty, they get paid by you. If you're innocent, then the ISP made a mistake and they pick up the tab.  The independent entity doesn't lose either way.   ___ &gt;Honestly I don't believe private business should be in the business of enforcing laws.  The six strike policy is not a law.  They implement these rules so they can remain in the safe harbor for the DMCA.  &gt;...section 512 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act requires that the ISPs have in place a termination policy for repeat copyright  infringers as a condition of availing themselves of the Act’s “safe harbor”  provision.   This is why subscribers have a right to know if it has been alleged that  content theft is taking place on their accounts, and a right to respond.  ___  **EDIT:** Someone posted a comment but has since deleted it before I could post my answer.  Since it gave me a chance to clear up some more misconceptions, I'll add it here.  The Post:  &gt;&gt;*Just to be clear, the independent entity will be paid either way, so it's not in their best interest to rule you as guilty. If you're guilty, they get paid by you. If you're innocent, then the ISP made a mistake and they pick up the tab. The independent entity doesn't lose either way.*  &gt;There is an inherent bias toward the ISP. Since the independent entity knows they will always be paid, they are incentivized to rule in favor of the party who hires them. The independent entity is not non-bias, when they depend on one party for future employment.  My Response:  &gt; There is an inherent bias toward the ISP.   No, just no.  From [here](http://www.copyrightinformation.org/node/709):  &gt; Another significant feature of the CAS is the ability of consumers to seek review of alerts they believe were sent in error. Content owners and ISPs want the system to be accurate. And we have established a fair and transparent process to correct errors should they occur. To do this, CCI developed an independent review program to be operated by the American Arbitration Association (AAA). AAA is a highly respected, neutral organization with deep experience in administering similar programs. The review system will allow consumers to ask a trained, impartial professional at AAA to review alerts fairly and confidentially, while honoring their expectation of privacy.   So who is the [AAA](http://www.adr.org/)?  &gt;The American Arbitration Association® (AAA), is a not-for-profit organization with offices throughout the U.S. AAA has a long history and experience in the field of alternative dispute resolution, providing services to individuals and organizations who wish to resolve conflicts out of court.  &gt;The AAA's official mission statement and vision statement are based on three core values : integrity, conflict management, and service. The AAA has long held its mediators and arbitrators to strict codes of ethics and model standards of conduct to ensure fairness and impartiality in conflict management. To further ensure the AAA's integrity, however, the Association also developed Standards of Ethics and Business Conduct for its staff, as well as a general Statement of Ethical Principles to expand on its core values as an organization. Finally, the AAA -- as a not-for-profit organization -- has a core dedication to service, and particularly education, in the field of alternative dispute resolution.  It's a not-for-profit organization whose entire existence is staked on the fact that they are extremely serious about being impartial.  If they were to do what you suggest they would, it would ruin their integrity as an organization.  If you're going to make wild claims of bias, you better provide actual facts, rather than your your random guesses.",®

t5_2qh16,crotchpoozie,1350851133,"&gt;""Saving"" for the future, in the current Zimbabwean economic atmosphere is a losing proposition, thanks to the way fiat money always fails. It was the same in Argentina, Germany, and now in Europe.  Picking the worst examples to demonstrate a general case is poor logic. If I point out the best examples, where a population has had long term stability and growth, does that make it true for all? No.   Average case - think about what that means.  &gt; Did you know the richest man in the world said that even giving money away in charity, trillions of dollars of it, does NOT work?   Irrelevant to discussion.  &gt;Having paper backed by nothing but the words of lying politicians is good?  The value of money is backed by the productive assets of an economy. Your words don't make it sound like you're interested in understanding how reality works.  There are ample examples of countries on proper gold standards, the country getting into economic trouble, and politicians causing all sorts of havoc with the money system. So if you have politicians willing to screw up an economic system no money system is stable. In fact, if you dig, I expect you can find more examples of failed gold standards because of political wrangling than you can failed fiat currencies.  The fact is - any political system can screw up any money system with equal ease.   So again, irrelevant to the historical evidence for or against commodity money versus fiat.  &gt; &gt; This is why all countries dropped the gold standard   &gt; Not true.  We just covered this. You posted a link to an article you claimed showed some non-fiat countries, but zero were listed.  So - which countries are still on a gold standard?    &gt; &gt; So you're afraid of ""backed by nothing,"" yet you put forth BitCoin?   &gt; It is backed by something, do you know what?    &gt;&gt; Backed by some random collection of electrons somewhere, which is basically nothing?   &gt; No...you do not understand bitcoin.  What gives it inherent value, as you listed inherent above? Explain it.   &gt; &gt; And it suffers from the same monetary problems economists have noticed the past several hundred years?   &gt; It is following about perfectly the ""Gartner Hype Cycle"".  This does not answer the question, and the misdirection is ridiculous. Again, how will Bitcoin avoid deflation when it runs out of new coins? Note that subdividing money does not avoid the problem.   &gt;Economies are changing and the world needs a better system. Did you know bankers are making the same thing as bitcoin, but their own version? The same people you trust in are following a... a... programmer?  Link?   Of course the world could always use a better system, but it is very hard to make one that works, and BitCoin exactly duplicates many features that a money supply should not have. It is far worse than even gold in it's limited size.  &gt; &gt; You'd get the same crap if an average economist designed a programming language - crap.   &gt; Dont tell the Swedes that‼  How does this even address that? I've seen bitcoin people claim MasterCard is about to release a BitCoin MasterCard, except masterCard has stated this is not true. So don't expect me to believe your BitCoin banking based on a forum post on a BitCoin site. Be sure to get back on this if it happens.  &gt;Hardly, centralizing anything that controls the life of millions from the hands of a few is called what model? → Communism. (See my username?)  Ok, I think we're done here. You have little understanding of communism. Words have meaning, and now you're labelling anything centralized that affects many people with Communism? Ridiculous.  Laws control the life of millions, always has, always will, so by your usage every political system is communism. Ridiculous.  &gt;This is the second Depression in about 80 years.  Yep, and the greatest economic growth in history and the fastest gain in quality of life in all of history. If you only look at the outlier events you miss the gains. ",‼

t5_2qh16,clgonsal,1350867404,"&gt; However since this was probably made pre-optical discs  Even ignoring the fact that the label says ""©2005"", optical discs have been in development at least since the mid 70's and  the CD became commercially available in 1982, while HD 3.5"" floppies weren't commercially available until 1987. You can tell this is an HD because of the hole opposite the write-protect hole, but even if we pretended it was only a DD (the earliest type available), they came out the same year as CDs.   &gt; I think a better generalization for the time would be external, removable storage was spelled with a ""c"" and internal storage with a ""k"".  Citation needed.  In my experience, ""disk"" has *always* been the common spelling for magnetic disks, internal or external. [Wikipedia agrees](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spelling_of_disc):  &gt;By the 20th century, the k-spelling was more popular in America, while the c-spelling was preferred in the UK. In the 1950s, when the American company IBM pioneered the first hard disk drive storage devices, the k-spelling was used. **Consequently, in Computer terminology today it is common for the k-spelling to refer mainly to magnetic storage devices**[3] (particularly in British English, where the term disk is sometimes regarded as a contraction of diskette, a much later word and actually a diminutive of disk).  ... &gt;Some latter-day competitors to IBM prefer the c-spelling. In 1979, the Dutch company Philips, along with Sony, developed the compact disc medium; here, the c-spelling was chosen. **The c-spelling is now used consistently for optical media such as the compact disc and similar technologies.**[4]  (emphasis mine)",©

t5_2qi0a,wadcann,1350880596,"I'm not a lawyer, but:  [Using the Trademarks of Others](http://www.citmedialaw.org/legal-guide/using-trademarks-others):  &gt;* Nominative Fair Use: The nominative fair use defense protects your ability to use a trademark to refer to a trademark owner or its goods or services for purposes of reporting, commentary, criticism, and parody, as well as for comparative advertising. Courts impose three requirements on defendants who want to take advantage of the nominative fair use defense: (1) the trademark owner, product, or service in question must not be readily identifiable without use of the trademark; (2) the defendant must use only as much of the mark as is necessary to identify the trademark owner, product, or service; and (3) the defendant must do nothing that would suggest sponsorship or endorsement by the trademark owner. This defense works against trademark infringement lawsuits. The federal dilution statute, found at 15 U.S.C. § 1125(c)(3)(A), also makes nominative fair use a complete defense to trademark dilution claims. Some examples of nominative fair use include a newspaper's use of the ""New Kids on the Block"" trademark to create and report on polls asking readers questions about the musical group's popularity; another newspaper's use of the trademark ""Boston Marathon"" in order to report on the sporting event; and a photographer's use of ""Barbie"" dolls in parody photographs that criticized Mattel's famous toy and the values she represents. Another example from our database is law blogger Eric Turkewitz's use of the Avis and Hertz logos in a blog post about a lawsuit involving these two companies. (Note, however, that there is some question about whether using a logo, rather than just a textual reference, would qualify as a fair use under the three-part test outlined above.)  also:  &gt;First Amendment Defenses: Courts have recognized a number of additional ""First Amendment"" defenses in particular situations. For example, in Rogers v. Grimaldi, 875 F2d 994 (2d Cir. 1989), the Second Circuit Court of Appeals held that a filmmaker could use Ginger Rogers' trademark (her name) in the title of a film called ""Ginger and Fred,"" even though the film was not primarily about Rogers. The court indicated that trademark law should be applied to artistic works ""only where the public interest in avoiding consumer confusion outweighs the public interest in free expression."" The specific details of these defenses is beyond the scope of this guide; the point to keep in mind is that courts may act to protect your right of free expression even if what you are doing doesn't fit nicely into one of the categories above.  My own view, which is not informed by any specific case history and is not that of a lawyer, is that it's probably fine.  At the end of the day, trademarked products are part of our society and culture.  The point of a trademark isn't to keep you from *talking* about something, but to keep you from *misrepresenting* yourself as being the creator of a production.  Avoiding misrepresentation is essential to permit building reputation.  Building reputation is important for our markets to function, for people to be able to choose to purchase products from someone who they have been happy with in the past.  If it's illegal for someone else to sell cereal under the name ""Wheaties"", as trademark law provides, then people can build up reputation associated with those Wheaties and know that, for example, cereal sold as ""Wheaties"" means that a product is of high quality and is satisfactory.  But that doesn't mean that you can't write a book or have a reality TV show or so forth in which the main character eats Wheaties for breakfast.  It's obvious there that the reality TV show isn't part of the Wheaties product line.  Now, all that being said, there should also be no possibility of confusion that the owner of the trademark is endorsing your own product.  A standard legal CYA (probably not necessary for the use you're making, but strengthens a legal position by providing an argument) may be to include the boilerplate stuff that you [may have seen on ads or other things that reference trademarks of someone else](http://aboutus.lego.com/en-us/legal-notice/fair-play/):  &gt; ""LEGO®is a trademark of the LEGO Group of companies which does not sponsor, authorize or endorse this site"".   I probably wouldn't list the ""Colt Bushmaster"" on the packaging or wherever where you don't want to make that disclaimer available without a purchase; again probably not a hard requirement, but strengthens your legal position.  And I would not use the Colt logo in the description, but simply the text.  You're simply describing a real-world gun to the user, and you need to use the text to make it clear which you are talking about.  The only minor point of confusion — and I'm not familiar with the case law here — is that there *are* license games that *do* specifically enjoy being able to claim that they are endorsed by the licensee, especially sports games and (closer to this) driving games, to the point that driving games routinely *do* license the car.  Whether-or-not requiring driving licenses would hold up in court, Ferrari *has* C&amp;Ded game creators who [don't have licenses](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20091102/2115416771.shtml).  Note that Ferrari can claim whatever they want; just because Ferrari does this doesn't mean that they would prevail in a lawsuit.  But I suspect that most people don't want to hassle with Ferrari on the point of a lawsuit.  There have been numerous commercial games in the past, like *Jagged Alliance 2*, which have referenced many weapons, and I strongly doubt that they went out to gun manufacturers and tried to get licenses.  EDIT: Please note that I am referring to law in the United States.  If you're dealing with some different jurisdiction, I've no idea how closely things run to the US.",®

I still have this same Squirtle (now a Blastoise) on my Black Version and I would never separate from my oldest childhood friend! ♥  2: I wouldn't say this was a best, but definitely weird. This was years ago, maybe only a few months after Red and Blue came out. I had finally gotten a Red Version, so I didn't have to try and haggle with kids at my school for their Red Version exclusives and Eevees. I had just beaten Brock and was on my way towards Mt. Moon when I was stopped in town all of a sudden. A text box came up that informed me that apparently my Pikachu was evolving. At Lv. 7, in Pewter City I got a Raichu. It wasn't over there though. After getting the Eevee in Celadon, I wanted a Flareon, so I went and bought a Fire Stone. When I went to use it, beside Raichu was ""ABLE."" I was confused as hell, so I tried it. Raichu began to evolve and when it finished, I had an Arcanine.

If your church has small groups, this is a great way to build friendships and do life with others who are pursuing God. It also is a great way to have accountability and have other godly people encourage and support you and pray for you.

But when I read the title, I was hoping for a rap: I'm an old-school atheist and I'm here to say, As you flock to /r/atheism, I yell ""Hooray!"" I've been doing this ish since before it was cool, So let me take a quick moment to take y'all to school. Disbelieving in god ain't always the easiest, But those fundie mothafuckas is truly the sleaziest. It ain't always easy, but it's definitely worth it, Because /r/atheism, you're truly the shit. Yo, if you believe in Islam I'm here to tell you, sorry, you're wrong. I know you think that Allah is the bomb, But mostly you're deluded misogynist dongs. And for all of you there who are my Christian bros, Messin' with your 12-year old alter boy ""hos,"" We're here to say your beliefs are whack There ain't no god and your pope's a quack. And finally, that brings me to my friends, the Jews. Please don't think we forgot about you. Don't believe that since you been around a little longer, That your ideas on Yahweh ain't wronger. World-wide floods? Partin seas? A talking bush? Sounds like OG stoners been smoking the kush. So the next time you're debating getting on your knees, /R/atheism is here to beg you, please, Try today, to just think for yourself. It's good for the world, and it's good for your health.

In addition to these two add-on content packs, the Elite Soldier Pack, which was free to those who pre-ordered XCOM: Enemy Unknown or purchased the game at launch, is now available for purchase. XCOM: Enemy Unknown has critics raving, including review scores of 9 out of 10 from PlayStation: The Official Magazine, 9.1 out of 10 from GameTrailers.com, and 9.5 out of 10 from Game Informer, earning ""Game of the Month"" honors in the November 2012 issue.  The Slingshot Content Pack, the first of two add-on content packs for XCOM: Enemy Unknown, will be available soon. In this new set of linked Council missions, gamers will meet an enigmatic Triad operative, divert an alien ship's course, and do battle with the aliens in the skies over China. The Slingshot Content Pack includes three new maps tied to the Council missions, a new playable squad character with a unique story and voice and new character customization options. The release date and pricing of the Slingshot Content Pack will be announced soon.  The Elite Soldier Pack, originally free for those who pre-ordered XCOM: Enemy Unknown or purchased the game at launch, is now available for purchase for $4.99 (PlayStation®Network) / 400 Microsoft Points (Xbox LIVE® online entertainment network) / $4.99 (Windows PC). The Elite Soldier Pack provides the ultimate tools for soldier customization in XCOM: Enemy Unknown, including:  * Classic X-COM soldier: Players will instantly receive a new recruit in their barracks inspired by the original X-COM: UFO Defense. The iconic soldier with the blonde, flattop hairstyle will return fully modernized. ￼ * Soldier Deco packs: Players can customize their soldier with several aesthetic upgrades to armor suits, including the new Hyperion and Reaper soldier armor kits.  * Complete color customization: A variety of colors and tints for all armor sets in the game allow players complete control to customize their squad's look.

The two tutorial missions will also introduce players to the XCOM base, where soldier training and researching alien technology takes place, and offers a chance to experience the tactical and strategic layers of XCOM: Enemy Unknown.  Released in 1993, the original X-COM still reigns as one of the best PC games of all time and has been reimagined as XCOM: Enemy Unknown by the strategy experts at Firaxis Games. XCOM: Enemy Unknown expands on the X-COM legacy with an entirely new story, enemies and technologies to fight hostile aliens and defend Earth. In XCOM: Enemy Unknown, players will oversee combat strategies and individual unit tactics as well as base management and resource allocation while playing as the commander of a secret global military organization, XCOM. With equal emphasis on deep strategy and intense tactical combat, XCOM: Enemy Unknown will allow gamers to control the fate of the human race by defending against a terrifying global alien invasion.

A lot of my friends used to say that SHers were weak or stupid, but they don't understand. I think it's one of the hardest things to do, listening to people who are naive tell us that we're ""attention whores"", but we have to remember that they don't understand and it's not their fault that they don't, but that their words *are not true*.

The first claimed detection of mammalian endogenous DMT was published in June 1965: German researchers F. Franzen and H. Gross report to have evidenced and quantified DMT, along with its structural analog bufotenin (5-OH-DMT), in human blood and urine.[42] In an article published four months later, the method used in their study is strongly criticized, and credibility of their results challenged.[43]  In 2001, surveys, made in research articles, point that few of the analytical methods previously used to measure levels of endogenously formed DMT had enough sensitivity and selectivity to produce reliable results.[44][45] Gas chromatography, preferably coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS), is considered a minimum requirement.[45] A study published in 2005[28] implements the most sensitive and selective method ever used to measure endogenous DMT:[46] liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry with electrospray ionization (LC-ESI-MS/MS) allows to reach limits of detection (LODs) 12 to 200 fold lower (that is, better) than those attained by the best methods employed in the 1970s. The data summarized in the table below are from studies conforming to the abovementioned requirements (abbreviations used: CSF = cerebrospinal fluid; LOD = limit of detection; n = number of samples; ng/L and ng/kg = nanograms (10−9 g) per litre, and nanograms per kilogram, respectively): DMT in body fluids and tissues (NB: units have been harmonized) Species 	Sample 	Results Human 	Blood serum 	&lt; LOD (n = 66)[28] Blood plasma 	&lt; LOD (n = 71)[28]  ♦  &lt; LOD (n = 38); 1,000 &amp; 10,600 ng/L (n = 2)[47] Whole blood 	&lt; LOD (n = 20); 50–790 ng/L (n = 20)[48] Urine 	&lt; 100 ng/L (n = 9)[28]  ♦  &lt; LOD (n = 60); 160–540 ng/L (n = 5)[45]  ♦  Detected in n = 10 by GC-MS[49] Feces 	&lt; 50 ng/kg (n = 12); 130 ng/kg (n = 1)[28] Kidney 	15 ng/kg (n = 1)[28] Lung 	14 ng/kg (n = 1)[28] Lumbar CSF 	100,370 ng/L (n = 1); 2,330–7,210 ng/L (n = 3); 350 &amp; 850 ng/L (n = 2)[50] Rat 	Kidney 	12 &amp;16 ng/kg (n = 2)[28] Lung 	22 &amp; 12 ng/kg (n = 2)[28] Liver 	6 &amp; 10 ng/kg (n = 2)[28] Brain 	10 &amp;15 ng/kg (n = 2)[28]  ♦  Measured in synaptic vesicular fraction[51] Rabbit 	Liver 	&lt; 10 ng/kg (n = 1)[28]",♦

t5_2qnwb,spook86,1351066424,"All psychotropic medications do is disrupt the frequency at which neurons using that particular affected receptor use. There are also feedback mechanisms (a lot) in those pathways, in your case dopamine stimulants trigger the uncoupling (deletion) of dopamine receptors. This is going to disrupt information processing in the brain, and will produce withdrawal symptoms and dependency syndromes which will transiently cause psychiatric and neurological problems. Not everyone experiences these symptoms, but most people will and usually will not understand what's happening.  For your personal research:  Here is the (Legally binding) Licensing information database for pychotropic drugs, simply search the brand or generic name of what your taking.  http://Dailymed.nlm.nih.gov  Also note, this is the database called ""Medline', it is where all scientific publications in medicine world wide are stored or listed. All doctors and psychiatrists should know what Medline is, even if they don't know it's online. http://ncbi.nih.gov/pubmed (also http://pubmed.org auto redirects)  *Please note most of what is published in psychiatry and pharmacology is not scientifically useful, or are ghost written or may simply be misleading. Eliminate articles that do not actually perform an experiment themselves where possible to reduce this - remember observations must be measured with an instrument, not a written test or something purely subjective.

When they entered their field themselves after graduating they found this was not the case. Namely there were no diagnostic tests, and there never will be because the basic science required to determine the what made someone with severe mental illness different from normal person never happened. The diagnostic tools are basically a book for of subjective 'symptoms', and there are two books, the ICDM (the rest of the world uses) and the DSM (America only). THe ICD-10 (the current version) does not recognize ADD or ADHD. As far as clinical trials for drugs went.. well they look like this: http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/news/content/article/10168/2054470 While that's a long confusing boring article, it says that out of 10,000 clinical trials there were 2,194 symptom rating scale systems for used. That means that a single symptom was interpreted in over 2,000 different ways. In other words, science does not allow us to measure something that cannot be reproduced in a repeatable way, like thermometer reading. The implication of having no standardized rating system (because it all subjective conjecture) means this is not science, this is pseudoscience. If you question anything your psychiatrist does, he's not going to have an answer unless hes fabricating it to make you more receptive to taking medicine that he thinks will help you. Why is Amphetamine, methamphetamine, and methlythenidate approved for illness that can't really be substantiated? Well, the world is driven by the most money the fastest, and i'm sorry that humans are shallow :(. http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-peter-breggin/psychiatric-drugs_b_1693649.html  I'm letting you know of all this because add and adhd medications lose their efficiency completely after 1 year of use (search the term 'long term use' on medline). Psychiatry is basically a pseudoscience, your parents probably never knew this, and that's why they won't take you off a pill that makes your gums bleed. i can only suggest you show them something like this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG1VHpsgUcY  I'm sorry you haven't been allowed to discontinue this drug.",®

So here's my question to you: if the fact that to play EA games online on the WiiU will require you to have an Origin account creates less impetus to purchase the system, does this also reduce the impetus to purchase from Sony and Microsoft as well? Or do you just dislike EA? At the moment it just seems like this is an unreasonable excuse to circlejerk over how much you dislike EA. You can dislike them all you want, but you can't say ""I'm definitely not buying the WiiU now because it has Origin"" as the statement is misleading (i.e. only your Origin ID is required for ONLINE play) and because Origin accounts are on all systems with EA games at the moment. Will you now trade in your Xbox or PS3? You could just avoid buying EA games and still get a WiiU. I just think this is an excuse for you to circlejerk while simultaneously giving an actually valid reason as to why you won't *really* be purchasing the WiiU (i.e. region-locking).",®

t5_2qhta,ticklesmypickle,1351071479,"These crystals are a result of your cat not getting enough water to flush the waste out of their body. Indoor cats are more prone to this because they usually eat kibble which doesn't contain the amount of water that, say, a mouse would contain. This is why some people feed their cats wet food. Sometimes cats are ""kibble addicts"", though and will refuse to eat anything but their dry food. If this is the case (as it was with my cat) or the problem persists, then you can give your cat a veterinary diet food designed to up your cat's water intake by raising the incentive to drink by including more magnesium and sodium than regular cat food. I use [UR Urinary St/Ox® Feline Formula](http://www.purinaveterinarydiets.com/Product/URUrinaryStOxCatFood.aspx) which my cat actually loves. It is expensive so I began my cat out at 100% of the Purina stuff for a couple of months to get rid of the crystals and then after I knew that the problem was not coming back I began to slowly mix the Purina with another over the counter, (meaning you can buy it at the store) urinary tract food that was cheaper. Eventually I got my cat at a 50/50 mix of the two. I found that the infections didn't recur if I fed her this and always had fresh water available for her. I have read that having a moving water fountain also provides incentive to drink as well. You can maybe find that food online or your vet can special order it for you. It runs around $50 a 16lb bag. My 10 lb cat gets 1, 1/2 cup scoop, twice a day with two 1/4 cup snacks periodically as well, and she goes through about 3-4 bags a year of the vet diet and the same of the over the counter stuff. If you don't want to buy an over the counter urinary diet to mix with the vet stuff, I suggest using a dry food that has a high moisture content that has meat listed as the first ingredient. Too many pet foods are cut with bone meal and nutrition-less fillers like wheat. Do cats eat wheat out in the wild? No.   I hope this helps you out. I learned all of this through a couple months of research, trial and error with my 3 year old baby and many trips to the vet. It sucked watching her suffer all the while and she also killed all the house plants in the process (she would squat and try to pee but she couldn't but eventually could and when she did, she peed in the plants). Good luck!",®

t5_2r9po,Acromir,1351105696,"I've seen builds like that before, although I can honestly never say I've seen it combined with a signet build. *Very* interesting. That said, here's my 100% honest opinion on that:  First off, let's look at the weapon set. I like the ability to close offered by Shadow Shot, but I'm rather skeptical about everything else.  Black Powder is a highly powerful defensive ability *if* you're either standing in it and firing projectiles or you can keep the enemy standing in it. It seems like your build does neither of those things, opting to lay it down for a simple blind and then leap for stealth. This makes it weak given the 6♦ cost.  Likewise, staying in melee will be hard. You have a shadowstep that you can use frequently, but then you have to *stay* in melee range to hit them with your dagger. Without any cripples or immobilizes, you're going to be using Shadow Shot often.  I'm skeptical about the damage this build can put out. Dagger's auto-attack is actually weaker than pistol and equal to sword. The true power of dagger in terms of DPS is in backstab. This build makes it exceedingly expensive to go into stealth (9♦), whereas a d/d build could enter stealth for less than half that cost. Cloak and Dagger also does as much damage as Black Powder -&gt; Heartseeker (over 25%), and in half the time. Heartseeker is decent damage, but only really worth using if your opponent is under 25% health.  I'm not a huge fan of Signet of Malice for this build. Rule of thumb: in order for SoM's passive to heal you for more than Hide in Shadows, you have to get off two attacks every second. This means either skills with rapid attacks or consistent AoE. For  D/P or P/P, SoM is great. It also works well with a shortbow or S/P if you're doing consistent AoE damage. If you're using SoM on cooldown for the active heal, you're healing for 20% more than HiS but you have to deal with the huge (and easily interrutped) cast-time and you don't get the stealth or condition removal.  You do have good mobility with the Shortbow and tons of initiative, but you have only one stun-break. Additionally, your build relies on using signets frequently, but in order for you to escape you need both Signet of Shadows (for the run speed) and Infiltrator's Signet (for the stun break). You'll also have a hard time disengaging by using Shadow Refuge (because it breaks stealth when you leave it), although you can use it to stay hidden once you break LoS.  ...  So there you go. Sorry if I came off as brutal, but that's my honest opinion. I just think that for a roaming WvW build, this is lacking in control abilities and escapes. I'm starting to think that any good roaming build needs a dagger offhand, because having that readily available stealth is just too good.  Nonetheless, I'm far from the Arena-Net official authority on all things thief. The most important thing is whether or not this build works for you. I couldn't make it work for me, but if it fits your style then by all means keep using it.",♦

t5_2r9po,Acromir,1351108960,"&gt;I actually don't use the Shadow Shot at all. Black Powder + Heartseeker (combo stealth) may be 3 initiative more expensive and do less damage overall, but it comes with a smoke field (already quite powerful on its own), a blind and a gap closer with Heartseeker (so I can stay in melee range easily). The best part is that I don't need to be in melee range or hit anything to enter stealth.  Does this give you the 2♦ from entering stealth? I was under the impression that didn't work if you stealth from combos. I thought that it had to be from a skill you use. The wording is ""Gain 2♦ when using a skill that stealths you."" If that trait applies, then I'll agree that your method has its merits. However, without it, you could CnD -&gt; Backstab twice as often with D/D.  &gt;It removes immobilize and chill  It does? How?  &gt;Shadow Refuge no longer breaks stealth when you leave it, after the Halloween patch.  Really? AWESOME! I was really busy yesterday, and all of my time on the computer was spent converting/editing/uploading this video. In that case, Shadow Refuge is epic.  &gt;I use Signet of Malice because of its extremely short cool-down, its utility during Dagger Storm, Cluster Bomb, and dagger auto-attacks. If Signet of Malice is on cool-down, I still have my healing from Stealth.  Fair enough. SoM is amazing for AoE fights, and combining it with Dagger Storm gives you god mode for 8 seconds. I guess it does also work well with your signet build, although I hate the long activation time. If it works for you, keep it. I've just personally never found it to be as good when I'm not AoE-bombing.  &gt;I have strayed away from main-hand Sword because it lacks the sheer damage output of Heartseeker spam and Backstab.  Completely agreed. Just some info on this, from testing/math I've done:  Sword and Dagger's auto-attack does the same damage (Dagger is ~1% more, but that's inconsequential). However, Sword is AoE and applies cripple/weakness. Dagger's Heartseeker is good single-target burst on an opponent under 50% health. Sword/Dagger has equivalent AoE burst with Dancing Dagger, which does surprisingly good damage in AoE.  D/D's true damage comes from CnD -&gt; Backstab. If we compare CnD -&gt; Backstab with S/D's CnD -&gt; Tactical Strike, D/D does 48% more damage from the back or equal damage from the front. However, Tactical Strike blinds from the front and dazes for 2s from the back. If you compare CnD -&gt; Backstab with Cnd -&gt; Tactical Strike -&gt; 2 autoattacks, S/D does equal damage to D/D.   Diffn't strokes fer diffn't folks.",♦

t5_2rc6i,Fishtails,1351187166,"Typed on my phone, I'll try and correct strange mis-typed errors as I see them.   Here's what I do, it may seem like a task but it really takes up but to change 25 gallons out of my 90 gallon takes no more than 10 minutes. Longer if I algae scrub first.  * step 1 is an ongoing process.  I have my RO/DI set up in the garage, which makes about 30 gallons of water per day.  I just leave it running during the week and it fills up a big 40 gallon rubbermaid bin in the garage.  In the bin I leave a pump with 5 or so feet of hose attached to it, more on that later.  I rinse and sterilize the bin every month or so with a light bleach solution.  * I also have a half dozen 5 gallon jugs, the kind you refill at the grocery store (which is often a pretty good place to get RO water in a pinch, most machines are serviced regularly) .  When I have enough water (which I can tell by scratch mark lines I put in the rubbermaid at 5 gallon intervals), I turn off the RO and move to the next step.  * I use the jugs because it makes it much easier for me to measure exactly how much water I replace.  I know that the salt I use is 2^1/2 cups of salt per 5 gallons, so I have a glass that holds the exact amount, and a funnel.  Put a scoop in each jug, takes about a minute, salt measured.  Take those salty jugs to the garage!  * plug in the water pump sitting in the RO water, hose in jug, fill.  Now you have however much measured saltwater you want.  I often just make 30 gallons and leave them for whenever.  Plan ahead, do this step in your spare time.  * water change day.  Now that we have saltwater laying around for use whenever, let's change some water.  Just before the change is a great time to feed the fish, if you want.  Now turn off all return pumps and powerheads, this is also the best time to algae scrub if you need to.  * **Highly recommended important step.**  have one jug specifically as a ""garbage jug."" I have black market on mine that clearly says ""NOT 4 FISH.""  This is the one that you siphon water from the tank into, I just use a basic 3/4"" vinyl hose to siphon. Old school style, I start the siphon with my mouth, no f&amp;@©s given.  *  90g tank, let's say I want to change 25g, I siphon out 5 jugs worth, while watching TV.  I like the 3/4"" hose because it's just fast enough of a siphon where sucking out 5 jugs worth takes about 10 minutes, that includes the time it takes me to dump the garbage jug out.  I usually graze over the surface of the sand and remove all the detritus I can find.  Using a turkey baster to blast stuff out from the rock crevices is useful to maximize crap removal, just make sure all flow is turned off.  Just one at a time, fill a jug, dump it. Pay attention not to overflow jug onto the floor.  * now that the water is out, time to refill.  Here's how I personally like to do it.  I briefly turn the return pump back on to push water out of the sump back into the tank. Then I set my first jug of clean saltwater on the table next to the tank. The table is higher than the sump, so I just insert my hose into the clean water, and siphon it into the sump, one at a time.  Once the water is all swapped, turn the flow back on, done.  Be sure and rinse the salty jugs with fresh water.",©

(I honestly don't know how to make sure that I am not being read in a sarcastic tone - I am being serious - I appreciate this.)  I go on win streaks when I am playing well and making shit up, and I go on losing streaks when i am playing poorly. (Which then typically leads me to go on full tilt and be a dick to everyone who is around me - I am sorry for this last week).  To be honest there are two ways to not get stuck like me. You can either learn actual builds and make correct reads based on what the opponent can be doing (don't try to pin them on a strat - eliminate possibilities)  while macro'ing well. The other is to have really great game sense and just wing it every game but have amazing micro mechanics so that you can win fights that you shouldn't be able to win while macro'ing fairly well. (The third option is still viable as well - just all in every game, but you won't really get better you will just get wins).   MacroJackson here is some ♥ and upvotes for you! :)",♥

I submitted a photo of my Roronoa Zoro earrings 28 days ago and have received nothing but nice and supportive comments. If it weren't for the masses of you asking me to please-make-them-for-you-too, I wouldn't have gone ahead and actually created an online store.  It was a long road, which included many loopholes to jump through to get everything up and running. A long road that was totally worth it. I created, you criticised, and I improved. What is left over now is a budding passion for One Piece and jewellery creating and a little of extra money I can make on the side, which in turn allows me to enjoy life just a little more. And who's to thank for that? Well, mostly *you*, Reddit. So honestly, from the bottom of my heart, thank you for your support, criticism and purchases! Thank you!  What else can I do than to return the favour, and how better to do so than in the form of a discount coupon? I really want to see you guys in my earrings, with or without the costume/cosplay, with or without the One Piece reference. I want to share my creations with you.  ###&gt;☠&lt; *Where do I go to use the coupon?*  http://lydocia.etsy.com  ###&gt;☠&lt; *How long will it be active?*  Until the 31st of October, 2012.  ###&gt;☠&lt; *Will they reach me in time?*  I'll admit, it's a bit of a gamble, but I haven't been able to put up this offer sooner, so my sincerest apologies for that. According to the post office, the package will arrive within the week, so if you order now and I can ship tomorrow, chances are they'll be there in time for the 31st. And if not...

t5_2qh2p,dragnier,1351220803,"Biologist here.  Just wanted to point out that the definitions of scales of evolution (micro v macro) are from creation apologist arguments which try to resolve the observed evolution (such adaptations of viruses and bacteria, or even larger things such as domestications of animals) as a different thing than the evolution which gives rise to speciation which they claim doesn't have sufficient evidence for since it comes from the nefarious, and devil placed, fossil records.   Logically it goes like this:  IN REALITY  &gt;**A** = heredity of genetic adaptation  &gt;**B** = speciation  &gt;**C** = evolution  Biology claims (based on thousands of lifetimes of academic research) that:  &gt;**A↔C**  &gt;and  &gt;**B↔C**  (those jerks) &gt; ∴ **A↔B↔C** meaning if one is true they are all true (really A and B are just different consequences of C)  The creationists now have a problem because now that A can be directly observed, it cannot be denied (as easily, boy do they try though). So these apologists try to split the definitions something like this:   &gt;**A** = heredity of genetic adaptation  &gt;**B** = speciation  &gt;***C*** = Micro evolution  &gt;***D*** = Macro evolution  Then creationists claim:  &gt;**A↔*****C***  &gt;and  &gt;**B↔*****D***  This is to remove any causal link between what we can literally point to, alive, in a lab, versus what we have to point to in a fossil record leaving them with the argument of   &gt;""you can't show me therefor you're wrong"".   Of course, you have shown them, they just redefined it to something else.   Unfortunately most atheists are not biologists, (though almost all biologists are atheists) and ""atheist apologists"" who will defend criticism like yours without understanding what they are saying. Mostly they are tripped up by trying to work within your framework assuming you have correct knowledge. For examples just look to the replies to your comment defending the original post which don't elucidate on the flawed claim of macro v micro.",↔

t5_2smhl,_wolfram,1351279881,"Taking Veigar to have 800 AP, ~100 Baleful Strike stacks, the game time to be about at the 40-45 min, and an inner turret as the target:  * Wth a stacked Guinsoo's Rageblade you will end up with 800 + (8 * 6 * 1.35[RDC and 4/4 Archmage mastery]) = **864.8 AP**.  * Pushing turrets with Veigar means you're dealing around 95.55+(864.8 * 0.4) = 441.47 turret-effective AD. You're only doing 100/180 of that (the turret will have 80 armour after minion reduction) when attacking turrets in the presence of minions so actually the net damage is 441.47 * 100/180 = **245.2611 turret-effective AD**.  * Your attack speed at max Guinsoo stacks is **1.077 /s**, so your turret DPS is 245.2611 * 1.077 = **264.1462 AD/s**.  * A full HP turret has 2550 HP so you would need 2550/264.1462 = **~9.7 seconds to take down a turret with Veigar**. It would take him ceiling(2550 / 245.2611) = ceiling(10.029) = **11 hits** to take down the turret and **no mana is consumed**.  * Total build cost: **13045g**  Now let's compare that with a typical Jax build:  * A level 18 Jax will have 117.05+40+30+35+3 = 225.05 AD assuming a Hextech Gunblade, Trinity Force, stacked Guinsoo's Rageblade and a 3/3 Brute Force mastery. Net damage on a turret will be 225.05 * 100/180 = **125.03 AD**.  * He will have **1.53 /s** attack speed with the above items and 4/4 Alacrity mastery, meaning 1/1.53 = **0.6546 s** intervals between each attack.  * A Sheen proc will deal total 125.03 + (117.05 * 1.5) = 300.755. Net damage on a turret will be 300.755 * 100/180 = **167.09 AD for Sheen proc**.  * Starting with a Sheen proc (⚔), and taking into mind the cooldowns of rank 5 abilities (off cooldown: ✓), the cumulative damage will result as follows:      1)    167.09     @ 0.0000 s     ⚔ W            ○●○○     2)    292.12     @ 0.6546 s     3)    417.15     @ 1.3092 s     4)    542.18     @ 1.9638 s     5)    709.27     @ 2.6184 s     ⚔ Q             ●●○○     6)    834.30     @ 3.2730 s     ✓W             ●○○○     7)    959.33     @ 3.9276 s     8)    1084.36    @ 4.5822 s     9)    1251.45    @ 5.2368 s     ⚔ W            ●●○○     10)   1376.48    @ 5.8914 s     11)   1501.51    @ 6.5460 s     13)   1626.54    @ 7.2006 s     14)   1793.63    @ 7.8552 s     ⚔ E             ●●●○     15)   1918.66    @ 8.5098 s     ✓W            ●○●○     16)   2043.69    @ 9.1644 s     ✓Q             ○○●○     17)   2168.72    @ 9.8190 s     18)   2335.81    @ 10.4736 s    ⚔ W           ○●●○     19)   2460.84    @ 11.1282 s     20)   2585.87    @ 11.7828 s   * **20** hits are needed; **245 mana** is consumed; and it takes **~11.8 seconds to take down an inner turret with Jax**.   * Total build cost: **13730g** with a Guardian Angel.  So it looks like to me in terms of split-pushing, Veigar is a better teacher of the definition of pain. In order for Veigar to tie with Jax:  * You need DPS * 11.7828 = 2550, so 2550 / 11.7828 = **216.4172 AD** taking into account resistances. To get the raw damage value, we do 216.4172 * 180/100 = **389.5508 raw turret-effective AD**. To get Veigar's required AP, we do (389.5508 - 95.55) / 0.4 =  **735.0021 AP**. To get the base AP without a stacked Rageblade, we take away the bonus stacks leaving us with 735.0021 - (8 * 6) =  **687 AP with unstacked Guinsoo's Rageblade**. If your items leave you with &lt;= 687 AP then Jax will be better at pushing the turret than you. If your items leave you with &gt; 687 AP then you will be pushing faster than Jax.  * If we ignore the Baleful Strike stacks completely, we would be at 661.5 AP and that is only 25.5 AP from competing with Jax.  By the way, Guinsoo's Rageblade was originally a joke but after some rough calculations I realised the lulz.",⚔

Manley (President and CEO of the Jeep brand) referred to adding Jeep production sites rather than shifting output from North America to China.”  &gt;Despite clear and accurate reporting, the take has given birth to a number of stories making readers believe that Chrysler plans to shift all Jeep production to China from North America, and therefore idle assembly lines and U.S. workforce.

It’s simply reviewing the opportunities to return Jeep output to China for the world’s largest auto market. U.S. Jeep assembly lines will continue to stay in operation.

The question is whether or not the jump from 48khz to 96khz makes an audible difference (or one that I would really want to pay for). Keep in mind this is motherboard optical out, so it's most likely lower quality than a good sound card anyways. Asus's specs don't give much info besides the fact that it's using the Realtek® ALC892 8-Channel High Definition Audio CODEC and has ""Absolute Pitch 192kHz/ 24-bit True BD Lossless Sound"".

t5_2qmiy,superapplekid,1351295107,"Ahh, sorry. I usually forget you can mix any bitrate/any sampling rate. I always just assume its 16bit/44-48khz or 24bit/96-192khz. Same rules should apply though. Higher sampling rates may give the DAC an easier time.  &gt;Asus's specs don't give much info besides the fact that it's using the Realtek® ALC892 8-Channel High Definition Audio CODEC and has ""Absolute Pitch 192kHz/ 24-bit True BD Lossless Sound"".   You could maybe even skip the DSP if you have that many channels out and use software to interact with your hardware drivers that splits/corrects the signal. I know there is software out there for this, but I won't be much help on what your chain should look like if you go this route. You'd be using more of your computers muscle, though, and if you want to do things like use the speakers for modern gaming it might be better to avoid this.  &gt;Keep in mind this is motherboard optical out, so it's most likely lower quality than a good sound card anyways.   The only way optical out can be flawed is through jitter, which most people think is a 'solved problem'.  Even though you might not have a removable soundcard your motherboard certainly is built for sound applications, and should have a reasonable sized buffer and good enough clock that its optical out is as good as it needs to be.",®

No 2 is to act directly opposite to the Love commandment (or Golden Rule) (or Optimistic Tit for Tat, as it is denoted in Artificial Intelligence). No 2 is a harmful, conflict creating behavior.  No 2 is equal to evilness or sinful behavior and can't be forgiven! It is a severe mental disturbance!  Unfortunately no 2 is tremendously abused in today's dystopic society. Just look upon the patent system, insane copyright laws, proprietary software, undocumented hardware, secret proprietary protocols  despite there are well established open standards that work excellent.

t5_2s48x,Nienordir,1351470001,"Honestly playing the objective in PS2 is boring, it's the right move, but it's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ boring. Just today we had a huge zerg at one of the stations.     I'm talking about at least 5-6 sunderers, more than a dozen tanks filling the whole courtyard and at least 40+ people sitting around bored to death waiting for the station to flip, while the opposition had already given up leaving the place completely uncontested..but you still sit around bored for like 10 minutes until you can move on..that's not fun at all.    I don't think that fighting at the crown is that much fun either, especially with all the draw distance/clipping issues. There is this famous line of rocks near the bridge, where usually dozens of people hang out and I couldn't snipe them, because the game decided that they weren't important enough to draw, but those stupid tanks on the mountain range, that I can't even hit or damage..they get drawn in favor of infantry near by..same with snipers on/near the bridge, that kill me with 'invisibility hacks' because they get culled by the engine..how am I supposed to react to something that's impossible to see?    But the thing is, who cares about owning territory when it simply doesn't matter. You have more resources than you ever need unless you get killed a lot or really only want to play with specialized units. And if you're not swimming in certs, then you want to go where the exp is, to make more builds viable, because there's no fun in using a 'useless' unupgraded unit.    Finally there are no consequences for losing a connection to the warpgate other than no resource gain (that you don't care about). So in order to make things more interesting they need to change the dynamic of the game, giving people a reason to cut-off territory as a valid strategy.    Imagine what would happen if cutting off the crown from the warpgate would stop infinite respawns and cause a respawn ticket count to run out. You could starve the defense by controlling the surrounding territory, force the faction to reinforce with galaxy drops or force them to take back at least one hex, which would split up forces from the crown and make both hot spots weaker..same with sunderers on both offense/defense..no adjacent hex with connection to warp gate? Just a few more respawns and that thing is useless until you move it back into a hex that is contested but adjacent to one you own with connection to the warpgate..    So until they make a change like that, fighting for territory is pointless..now that I think about it another option would be to increase resource cost when you lose control of a point. For every surrounding hex that you don't own, the resource cost for spawning stuff there goes up, once you lose 3/4 of the hexes even infantry respawns start to cost infantry resources, once its completely surrounded by enemy territory cost is doubled again..now there are reasons to reinforce from bases further away, because its cheaper, but it costs time to get there.._AND_ you can't hold a place forever, because people will quickly run out of resources and lose the ability to spawn there, if they don't make serious efforts to connect that place again..",♥

Deuteronomy 22:28-29 (King James Version)  28If a man find a damsel that is a virgin, which is not betrothed, and lay hold on her, and lie with her, and they be found;   29Then the man that lay with her shall give unto the damsel's father fifty shekels of silver, and she shall be his wife; because he hath humbled her, he may not put her away all his days.  Leviticus 25:44 English Standard Version (©2001) As for your male and female slaves whom you may have: you may buy male and female slaves from among the nations that are around you.  Deuteronomy 22 22:20 But if this thing be true, and the tokens of virginity be not found for the damsel:  22:21 Then they shall bring out the damsel to the door of her father's house, and the men of her city shall stone her with stones that she die: because she hath wrought folly in Israel, to play the whore in her father's house: so shalt thou put evil away from among you.  ""But those mine enemies, which would not that I should reign over them, bring hither, and slay them before me."" (Luke 19:27. In a parable, but spoken of favorably.)  John 15:6 If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned.  Jesus encouraged the beating of slaves: ""And that servant [slave], which knew his lord's will, and prepared not himself, neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes."" (Luke 12:47)  Matthew 10:34 ""Do not suppose that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I did not come to bring peace, but a sword.  Jesus said that whoever calls somebody a ""fool"" shall be in danger of hell fire (Matthew 5:22), yet he called people ""fools"" himself (Matthew 23:17)  1 Samuel 15  15:2 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I remember that which Amalek did to Israel, how he laid wait for him in the way, when he came up from Egypt.	     15:3 Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.  31:15 And Moses said unto them, Have ye saved all the women alive?  31:17 Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him.  31:18 But all the women children, that have not known a man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves.  ""Anyone who does not provide for their relatives, and especially for their own household, has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.""(1 Timothy 5:8)  Marrying a divorced woman is adultery.

He broke the law by stealing corn on the Sabbath (Mark 2:23), and he encouraged his disciples to take a horse without asking permission (Matthew 21)  Matthew 5:17-18 17 Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.  18 I tell you the truth, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished.  New International Version (©1984) The LORD was with the men of Judah. They took possession of the hill country, but they were unable to drive the people from the plains, because they had iron chariots.  1 Corinthians 6:9-10  English Standard Version (ESV)  9 Or do you not know that the unrighteous[a] will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived:  neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men who practice homosexuality,[b] 10 nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God.  Kings 2 2:23 And he went up from thence unto Bethel: and as he was going up by the way, there came forth little children out of the city, and mocked him, and said unto him, Go up, thou bald head; go up, thou bald head.  2:24 And he turned back, and looked on them, and cursed them in the name of the LORD. And there came forth two she bears out of the wood, and tare forty and two children of them.    34:13 And thorns shall come up in her palaces, nettles and brambles in the fortresses thereof: and it shall be an habitation of dragons, and a court for owls.  34:14 The wild beasts of the desert shall also meet with the wild beasts of the island, and the satyr shall cry to his fellow; the screech owl also shall rest there, and find for herself a place of rest.   ""And if your hand or your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it from you; it is better for you to enter life crippled or lame, than having two hands or two feet, to be cast into the eternal fire,"" (Matt. 18:8).  ""And these will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life"" (Matt. 25:46).   31 “Behold, I am against you, O arrogant one,” Declares the Lord God of hosts, “For your day has come, The time when I will punish you  ""And the devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are also; and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever,"" (Rev. 20:10).  Women's rights: Genesis 3:16  Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.   Isaiah 3:12  As for my people, children are their oppressors, and women rule over them.   1 Corinthians 11:3  But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God.   1 Corinthians 14:34-36  Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but they are commanded to be under obedience as also saith the law. And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church.   Ephesians 5:22-24  Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body. Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing.   1 Timothy 2:11-15  Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection. But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence. For Adam was first formed, then Eve. And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression. Notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing.   Titus 2:4-5  Teach the young women to be ... obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.   1 Peter 3:1  Likewise, ye wives, be in subjection to your own husbands.  Numbers 31:15 And Moses said unto them, Have ye saved all the women alive? 31:17 Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him.  31:18 But all the women children, that have not known a man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves.

The relevance to Micronesia is two fold. For one, the Japanese installed the same type of British-built pre-World War II guns on many of the Micronesian Islands in the east, Palau in the south and the CNMI in the north. The Kiska guns allow for an examination of the differential effects of climatic condition on the decay of these. This gun still has some wooden components, as well as sections of rubberised canvas in situ. Secondly, this particular gun is significant on a regional, if not a global scale as it the only known surviving gun to have come from the battleship Fuji, the first battleship built by the British for the Empire of Japan (in 1894). The success of the Fuji led to successive contracts for British naval yards and to a close co-operation between the British and Japanese navies, which effectively facillitated Japan's entry into World War I at the side of Britain—which in turn resulted in Japan occupying the German colonies in Micronesia and its entry as a colonial power in the region.""",©

This triggered the extinction of almost 70% of the species of life on Earth including the dinosaurs. Other impacts prior to this one have caused even greater extinctions. **Preventing collisions with the Earth by hypervelocity asteroids, meteoroids, and comets is the most important immediate space challenge facing human civilization.** This is the Impact Imperative. We now believe that while there are about 2000 earth orbit crossing rocks greater than 1 kilometer in diameter, there may be as many as 200,000 or more objects in the 100 m size range.  Can anything be done about this fundamental existence question facing our civilization? The answer is a resounding yes! By using an intelligent combination of Earth and space based sensors coupled with an infra‐structure of high‐energy laser stations and other secondary mitigation options, we can deflect inbound asteroids, meteoroids, and comets and prevent them from striking the Earth. This can be accomplished by irradiating the surface of an inbound rock with sufficiently intense pulses so that ablation occurs. **This ablation acts as a small rocket incrementally changing the shape of the rock’s orbit around the Sun. One‐kilometer size rocks can be moved sufficiently in about a month while smaller rocks may be moved in a shorter time span.**  ^(© 2003 American Institute of Physics)",©

t5_2cneq,-Gravitron-,1351624783,"I work for a supplier to Chrysler, and today we received an email from the CEO (Sergio Marchionne). I personally believe Romney is a conniving scumbag, but it's important to note that the only lie in his comment was use of the word ""all."" Please note the items in bold:   *""Chrysler Group's production plans for the Jeep® brand have become the focus of public debate.*   *I feel obliged to unambiguously restate our position: Jeep production will not be moved from the United States to China.*   *North American production is critical to achieving our goal of selling 800,000 Jeep vehicles by 2014. In fact, U.S. production of our Jeep models has nearly tripled (it is expected to be up 185%) since 2009 in order to keep up with global demand.*   *We also are investing to improve and expand our entire U.S. operations, including our Jeep facilities. The numbers tell the story:*   *• We will invest more than $1.7 billion to develop and produce the next generation Jeep SUV, the successor of the Jeep Liberty -- including $500 million directly to tool and expand our Toledo Assembly Complex and will be adding about 1,100 jobs on a second shift by 2013.*  *• At our Jefferson North Assembly Plant, where we build the Jeep Grand Cherokee, we have created 2,000 jobs since June 2009 and have invested more than $1.8 billion.*   *• In Belvidere, where we build two Jeep models, we have added two shifts since 2009 resulting in an additional 2,600 jobs.*   *With the increase in demand for our vehicles, especially Jeep branded vehicles, we have added more than 11,200 U.S. jobs since 2009. Plants producing Jeep branded vehicles alone have seen the number of people invested in the success of the Jeep brand grow to more than 9,300 hourly jobs from 4,700. This will increase by an additional 1,100 as the Liberty successor, which will be produced in Toledo, is introduced for global distribution in the second quarter of 2013.*   ***Together, we are working to establish a global enterprise and previously announced our intent to return Jeep production to China, the world's largest auto market, in order to satisfy local market demand, which would not otherwise be accessible. Chrysler Group is interested in expanding the customer base for our award-winning Jeep vehicles, which can only be done by establishing local production. This will ultimately help bolster the Jeep brand, and solidify the resilience of U.S. jobs.***  *Jeep is one of our truly global brands with uniquely American roots. This will never change. So much so that we committed that the iconic Wrangler nameplate, currently produced in our Toledo, Ohio plant, will never see* **full production** *outside the United States.*  *Jeep assembly lines will remain in operation in the United States and will constitute the backbone of the brand.*  *It is inaccurate to suggest anything different.*   ***Sergio Marchionne**""*  Correct me if I'm wrong, but it appears as though there will be **some** production outside the US; just not **all** production.",®

(BUSINESS WIRE), Aug 9, 1999 - In a effort to make computers friendly and affordable for families, Mattel Inc. (NYSE:MAT) has announced that it has teamed up with Patriot Computers to launch the first-ever BARBIE® and HOT WHEELS® branded PCs for children.  The new BARBIE® and HOT WHEELS® PCs, which include a 15-inch monitor, will be available from Patriot Computers at $599 this September and can be financed for as little as $14.98(a) per month. Each computer system will feature an Intel® Celeron(TM) processor 333 MHz and will be loaded with a library of popular education and entertainment titles from Mattel Media and The Learning Company, with an approximate retail value of more than $500.  Created with children's interests in mind, the customized BARBIE® and HOT WHEELS® PCs will be specially designed to capture the essence of each brand. For example, the beautiful silver-colored BARBIE® computer with pink and purple floral accents, will include a customized tower, monitor, keyboard and speakers and will come with special Barbie® accessories such as the Barbie® Digital Camera, a Barbie® mouse, mousepad and CD holder.  The sleek blue and gold HOT WHEELS® PC will also come with a customized tower, monitor, keyboard and speakers and will boast the famous flame logo. Hot Wheels® accessories will promote the power, speed and performance of the brand and will include a Hot Wheels® steering wheel peripheral, mouse, mousepad and CD holder.  ""When a child learns a sport or an art at an early age, they are more likely to excel in that area throughout their life. Today it is the same with computers. As technology revolutionizes everything we do, it is becoming increasingly important that children are familiar with it,"" said Mark Durst, president, Patriot Computers.  Consumers will be able to order BARBIE and HOT WHEELS PCs directly from Patriot Computers starting on Sept. 15 over the Internet at either www.barbiepc.com or www.hotwheelspc.com or by telephone at 888/850-KIDS (4537).",®
t5_2qh1i,thejennadaisy,1351648710,"&gt;When taken as directed, approximately seven  out of eight women who would have gotten pregnant will not become  pregnant after taking Plan B® One-Step.  So she has about a 12% chance of being pregnant if she would have gotten pregnant had she not taken the pill. Whether or not she would have gotten pregnant is highly dependent upon where she was in her cycle, but the fertility window in every cycle is about 2 days. I'd say the chances are pretty low.

t5_2qh6c,aim2free,1351701663,"Ok, thanks❣ That was good to hear. That is basically in quite detail what I am myself working on (not claiming to be any Messiah though just doing my part...) but basically what I consider every being on this planet should work towards.  Aha, that ""bridge metaphor"" I haven't heard about. That was very interesting to hear. I have removed the details about what I'm working on now, but they are available on one archive page from 2004. If you [check point 9](http://web.archive.org/web/20041207000905/http://www.nonutopia.org/personal/dream/invention.html) after     **This patented method will, when properly used** , i.e.  * *Help us adapt to new powerful future technologies like nano technology.*  Nano technology is the ""ultimate technology"" one can say, the one God is working with. Of course we already have it, it is implemented in every living cell, it is implemented everywhere where atoms are combined with atoms into larger aggreagates, usually denoted molecules.  However, the human technical evolution starting from long time ago, one can say has as its goal to end where we started. The only difference is that now we also understand the technology. We have become like ""children of God"" in one sense.  Anyway, what I am developing has nothing with nano technology to do (even though I am a member of [Foresight Institute](http://foresight.org/)). What I am developing is a service to create anything creatable with our human technology and knowledge on demand, with the side effect to make the human mind benevolent and intelligent (as I consider most part of the humanity to be in a kind of sleeping state now....).  Basically this Artificiall Intelligence (not a human like AI) people will ""pray to"" (although no rituals and such) and this will over time adapt the humanity to God like beings that are able to both Love unconditionally and be creative (they are related) at the same time.  I do not know what will happen in the future, but my guess has been during the last 11 years, since I told my son about this in 2001 after I had visited  the fantastic ""StarLab"" in Brussels, which unfortunately went bankrupt the same summer after my visit, what I told him was:  Apart from adapting the humanity towards advanced technologies where they can get anything they can ever want as long as it is not in conflict with anyone else's desires and needs and does not limit any one elses freedom, it will also develop the human species into thinking creative individuals, as they also need to specify in detail what they want. This thinking enables their logical thinking again (which they were born with) and logic is the same as unconditional love due to my definition.  This process I denote the [Singularity](http://wish-it.se/hip/singularity2). What was also interesting was when I told my spouse, who has got a Catholic education, my definition of the Singularity, she said that this was what Jesus said as well.  So, could this what I'm describing and working on, be this ""bridge metaphor"" you mentioned? ",❣

t5_2qi0s,NPVT,1351710928,"- The Effect of Bicycle Helmet Legislation on Bicycling Fatalities Formats Available in JSTOR: Page Scan, PDF  Abstract Bibliographic Information Author Information Notes and References Items Citing This Item Abstract(back to top)  A number of states passed legislation in the 1990s requiring youths to wear helmets when riding bicycles. The effect of this legislation on bicycling fatalities is examined by subjecting data from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System to a panel analysis, using a control-group methodology. A helmet law reduces fatalities by about 15 percent in the long run, less in the short run. There is no evidence of spillover effects (to adults) or substitution effects (youths choosing other methods of transportation) associated with implementation of a helmet law. Through 2000, existing helmet laws have saved 130 lives. If all states had adopted helmet laws in 1975, more than 1500 lives would have been saved. © 2004 by the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management.   - Bicycle Helmets: It's Time To Use Them: The Evidence That They Reduce Head Injuries Is Too Strong To Ignore Formats Available in JSTOR: Page Scan, PDF  Abstract Bibliographic Information Author Information Notes and References Items Citing This Item Abstract(back to top)  An abstract for this item is not available.

Formats Available in JSTOR: Page Scan, PDF  Abstract Bibliographic Information Author Information Notes and References Abstract(back to top)  The issue of mandatory cycle helmets is highly contentious. The aim of this paper is not to argue for or against legislation but to suggest criteria on which the debate should focus. This is done by attempting to answer the question: 'What criteria must be met before cycle helmet wearing is enforced?' Consideration is given to principles, precedents and consequences and four criteria are suggested. The criteria are to do with effectiveness, personal liberty, public acceptability and the promotion of the public health benefits of cycling.  - Injury Patterns In Cyclists Attending An Accident And Emergency Department: A Comparison Of Helmet Wearers And Non-Wearers Formats Available in JSTOR: Page Scan, PDF  Abstract Bibliographic Information Author Information Notes and References Items Citing This Item Abstract(back to top)  Objectives—To study circumstances of bicycle accidents and nature of injuries sustained and to determine effect of safety helmets on pattern of injuries. Design—Prospective study of patients with cycle related injuries. Setting—Accident and emergency department of teaching hospital. Subjects—1040 patients with complete data presenting to the department in one year with cycle related injuries, of whom 114 had worn cycle helmets when accident occurred. Main outcome measures—Type of accident and nature and distribution of injuries among patients with and without safety helmets. Results—There were no significant differences between the two groups with respect to type of accident or nature and distribution of injuries other than those to the head. Head injury was sustained by 4/114 (4%) of helmet wearers compared with 100/928 (11%) of non-wearers (P=0.023). Significantly more children wore helmets (50/309 (16%)) than did adults (64/731 (9%)) (P&lt;0.001). The incidence of head injuries sustained in accidents involving motor vehicles (52/288 (18%)) was significantly higher than in those not involving motor vehicles (52/754 (7%)) (ϰ²=28.9, P&lt;0.0001). Multiple logistic regression analysis of probability of sustaining a head injury showed that only two variables were significant: helmet use and involvement of a motor vehicle. Mutually adjusted odds ratios showed a risk factor of 2.95 (95% confidence interval 1.95 to 4.47, P&lt;0.0001) for accidents involving a motor vehicle and a protective factor of 3.25 (1.17 to 9.06, P=0.024) for wearing a helmet. Conclusion—The findings suggest an increased risk of sustaining head injury in a bicycle accident when a motor vehicle is involved and confirm protective effect of helmet wearing for any bicycle accident.

t5_2qh2p,DarrenEdwards,1351711145,"Halloween 1987.  I was pretty much an atheist, I just didn't know the name for it.  I was hanging around with a new group that year.  Some of them pretty superstitious.  The topic of demons came up and we were going to prove once and for all their existence with a ouija board.  A new girl to the school swore a demon, name Bloody Mary, had followed her from her home town.  I volunteered my parents place.  We had a farm, and not only that, it had a graveyard as it was almost it's own town during the early homestead days.  So myself and 4 girls that weren't too creeped out watched a few movies, ate popcorn and waited for my parents to settle down for the evening.  At go time, we realized one important piece was missing: the Ouija board.  Being many miles away from an official Parker Brothers® board we had to improvise.  Drawing it on paper just brought up arguments.  Random letters... That's when I got the great idea to substitute with a scrabble board.  I, thinking this was a joke from the get go, assume that somebody would call bullshit.  Nope, we were go.  We headed out to the graveyard with red candles, matches, playground chalk and Scrabble by Parker Brothers® ready to conjure up the Oregon arch demon Bloody Mary.  I did ponder the repercussions of being sacrilegious to my own distant blood relatives final resting place, but brushed it aside as 2 of these girls were cute.  No matter, they all got spooked half way there.  It was decided that any old place was just as good for summoning spirits, even a cow pasture.  So we stopped in the middle of our field.  I drew out a pentagram, because nothing like arbitrary lines get demon attention.  Candles are lit, and our Oregon demon expert starts in.  I don't remember if she said any magical speeches, but she did attempt to communicate with the great beyond in the same style that Arthur Dent discovered the question to life with less spectacular results.  Bloody Mary did not grant us a triple word score.  We admitted defeat and walked back home.  I never got with any of them.  However, months later my mother attempted to play scrabble and asked for an explanation as to why there was red candle was all over her scrabble board. ",®

But, common knowledge may not be a reliable guide to truth. I've read many of Dr. Guyenet's posts, and while I appreciate his eloquent, direct, and erudite approach to the subject, I think the evidence he presents on this particular issue is insufficient to prove his conclusions. It raises good questions that deserve investigation, but it doesn't persuade me, at least, to forget all about the hypothesis that chronically elevated insulin causes obesity, at least in some people.  I think there is a lot more research that is needed to actually settle the issue, especially new experiments that can conclusively rule out some of the options.  Gary Taubes has an enormous response to Dr. Guyenet's criticisms posted as a series of blog posts:  http://garytaubes.com/2011/09/catching-up-on-lost-time-ancestral-health-symposium-food-reward-palatability-insulin-signaling-carbohydrates-kettles-pots-other-odds-ends-part-i/  Frankly, I haven't gotten around to reading it yet, both because it is a lot of text, which I expect to be dense text, and because I didn't find Dr. Guyenet's criticisms so compelling that I felt the need to understand Taubes's response. I would assume Dr. Guyenet also blogged some sort of response to that response, too, before their tempers died down. ☺",☺

t5_2qh1i,lessnonymous,1351727658,"Not angry at me, but relevant.   My wife is an awesome writer who writes long form articles as a freelancer. She recently interviewed Martin Sheen.   I'm a part time cake decorator.   She posted a photo of one of my cakes to Facebook at about the same time as a link to her interview.   I totally understand her frustration that my cake got many many more [Like 👍]s than her article!",👍
t5_2qioo,skinny_whale,1351727969,"Alright I think it is fixed now. I ran Malwarebytes and got one hit. this is what the log said, if it is of any use to anybody :) Registry Data Items Detected: 1 HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\CryptSvc|Start (Disabled.Cryptsvc) -&gt; Bad: (4) Good: (2) -&gt; Quarantined and repaired successfully.  I have started up succesfully like 4 times in a row so it seems good. Thanks for you support ♥",♥
