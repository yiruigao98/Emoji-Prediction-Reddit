t5_2qh2a,Prettym1k3,1330627832,"In the end, I've had people upload them to sites like Photobucket, Flickr, and Snapfish.  I hate this, because their prints suck, and the resolution of the image (viewable on most monitors) sucks.  But people do it.  And on top of that, places like SnapFish allow you to order prints, so we've lost print income there.  I tell people all the time to upload their images to Facebook, and just tell them that we just need photo credit underneath the photos in the ""edit"" section.  Something like, ""© Prettym1k3 Photography 2012 www.blahblahblah.com"".  This gives us recognition and credit, and markets on our behalf.  Our clients have been super happy to do this for us.  And Facebook is an invaluable tool for us, as we don't pay a dime to market ourselves and we're entirely word of mouth.  The problem with things like Facebook, etc., is the ""download original"" option, which means that if we get a savvy friend/family member of a client, they download the full resolution image from Facebook, take it to a printer, and then we lose sales on prints.  In the end, we live in an age where if someone wants a picture, they can find any number of ways to steal it.  Hack a gallery password, screen capture, right-click and save as, or just simply buying the images, and then passing them out to everyone and their mother.  That's why we charge what we charge for prints, and CD's.  Sadly, it's not the photographers driving up the price, it's the customers and/or technology.  But that's okay.  That's the way the world works, so we adapt.  Then our customers will adapt.  Then we'll adapt again.  It's the circular nature of business.",©

t5_2qil9,meowtiger,1330666158,"mini and i were on his ts one time with a dude who runs somer talking shop between eoh and blink, it was actually pretty interesting discussing how hard both try to profit off the service  somer has a much bigger margin than eoh :)  let's task team bff with a complete re-imagining of ecm. i trust ccp punkturis implicitly because of her sexy accent♥♥♥  forgive me for the wow reference i'm about to make - back in the day i played an arms warrior in arena at 70. i played sword spec because i focused on 5s and world/bg pvp (sword spec gives you a % chance of double swing), but i was very gimped in 2v2 (where i ended up titling anyway because i am a badass at every game i touch) because i didn't play mace spec (% chance of short stun) which was much more powerful in 2s  now, my style definitely did work - i played with a shaman so i got extra swings from windfury also, but mostly we won matches due to superior play. however, when we played a mirror against a mace warrior, we almost always lost, because the extra damage from my sword spec was just not as dramatic and game-altering as the RNG stun from mace spec that i was too ~honourable~ to swap to for 2s  does that make me a bad player or a good player? it's a grey area. i would have done better if i played maces, but some would call it a crutch. really, what matters at that point? morals are relative in eve. it depends if your goal is winning or fun, or e-honor or whatever you want to call it. if you want to win, the obvious choice is to use ecm drones because they are hilariously powerful (when they do work, which on average they will at least once per fight) compared to dps drones, at least in terms of light drone sized options. if you want to have fun, use whatever you want. if you want to be honorable, stay away from ecm drones",♥

t5_2qh03,BellaEpoca,1330720351,"&gt;I don't feel like giving up on gaming quite yet  Nobody is saying you have to give it up forever.  Think of it as a break. I honestly believe it's very *healthy* to take long breaks, mainly because of rehashed games that are just excuses to milk you for money, and it's a terrible habit the industry has right now (just look at MW yearly releases as a perfect example..).  Mass Effect 3 is coming out in a couple of days, perhaps you could take a break right now and play it a few months from now, after it's been properly patched.  It's a Bioware game after all, and you know how they *rush everything out the door* to meet deadlines and milk people for 1st-day DLC.   Personally, I just finished the New Vegas Ultimate Edition, and I *loved it*, but now I'm going on a break to take care of real life stuff, and I will come back to gaming to play Mass Effect 3 a few months from now, after it's been polished a bit, and hopefully down in price.  Once in a while, I like to play games from the SNES library, using an emulator.  I have about 800 roms I like to explore now and then.  I consider it proof that gaming will always be there waiting for you.  It's not going anywhere. ♥",♥

Since the K series are targeting enthusiasts, Intel probably decided to disable some of the less important features. My guess is based on the following two sites. They benchmarked Sandy Bridge parts but I assume the same holds true for Ivy Bridge.  Techarp shows the 2600k doing better than the normal 2600 in x264 encoding. http://www.techarp.com/showarticle.aspx?artno=669&amp;pgno=1  Same for passmark. http://www.cpubenchmark.net/cpu.php?cpu=Intel+Core+i7-2600K+%40+3.40GHz  By the way, for clarification, the features disabled aren't AES-NI and not all of Virtualization. The ones disabled are Intel® vPro Technology, Intel® Virtualization Technology for Directed I/O (VT-d), and Intel® Trusted Execution Technology. Intel® Virtualization Technology (VT-x) and AES New Instructions are still there.

t5_2stfn,bamfusername,1330784238,"I'm going to quote TMP on aggressive pyro play. While the popular way of playing pyro now is still largely defensive, a lot of pyros have difficulty transitioning to aggressive play, or have poor timing while attempting to do so.  You see, a while back, the way to play pyro was basically 'latch yourself to the pocket, spycheck and m2 projectiles'. And while there's nothing intrinsically wrong with this, the pyro *is* capable of engaging, harassing and poking at the other team.   If you think that this is your thing, try and play, for lack of better terms, like a longer leash secondary pocket, or a roamer on a short leash.   ---  TMP's tips on playing aggressively. ---  To play aggressively as pyro is to actively seek and force situations (IE Killing your opponents). To play defensively is to prevent your opponent from creating advantageous situations (IE Reflecting rockets from a sentry gun or spychecking).  I'll start by saying this. Playing purely offensive pyro can be just as bad (or others would call it worse) than playing purely defensive pyro. Either way both are bad. Actively just attempting kill after kill CAN work (And if it does that's probably the way to go!), just as sitting back and doing no damage but preventing some can be just as bad (Though if it works then that's a way to go!).  The idea behind playing an offensive pyro is to get an enemy into a tipping point where your aggression overwhelms him and he just dies. Those who understand pyro v pyro know how this can happen pretty well. Get an adequate advantage and then you can roll over your enemy. So the core idea is creating this advantage and understanding the tipping points of an aggressive style (which can be loadout dependent).  How do you do this? You poke. You flank. You patrol. You W+M1. It's all stylistic and situation dependent. If you encounter a scout around a corner, the aggressive way to take him out is to reach that tipping point to kill a scout close range and just kill him. If you encounter a heavy while being aggressive, you try to get him into a tipping point where you know you can kill him in by utilizing your advantages over him.  The beauty of this style is that the actions you can do in it can have immediate pressure effects and lead your opponents into doing certain things. Moving to get around you. Hunting you down. Forcing a soldier to fire rockets at you for his life! All of these are really REALLY applicable instances of pressure that you apply to your enemies by simply doing that: You're not simply confined to preventing action, you're actively causing enemy action. And you can even do this in a defensive stance, if you're simply pressuring them enough offensively to make them threatened.  The problems with the style come down to the fact that the tipping point is not exactly known. There's no set tipping point really for all situations to just run in there. It requires a lot more knowledge on what you can do. A person with good flamethrower understanding, very impressive flare aim, and higher retreat ability can poke heavies for longer and reach a tipping point easier, or potentially have a higher hp value on a target for their tipping point into aggression. There's also the fact that sometimes you can't physically reach that tipping point well, so to maintain aggression and get payoff, you have to die. This is common in suiciding for the medic. Also, if you have a default tipping point value, but you underperform (IE miss more often than you normally do), you're probably going to lose the clash.  Despite this, there are some major benefits to offensive oriented play. As a pyro, it's way way WAY easier for you to retreat than it is for you to advance on someone, so by playing aggressively, you gain the ability to punish overextending way harder than someone who is playing passively, while being able to potentially escape from more of your overextending yourself. The only class I can even say that it would be harder to retreat from than to aggress would be scout, and even then, the scout runs a major risk by aggressing a retreating pyro - simply because the pyro can just kill an overextended scout in a stupidly low amount of time. Since you're playing more into your opponent's front line as an offensive pyro then as a defensive pyro, you have more map to work with and more to transition into easily. An offensive pyro can relatively easily translate to a defensive pyro if the situation warrants it.  If you're going to try offensive pyroing, just go out and try it. Don't be afraid to die a lot, and try to learn some of those tipping points for situations. You can abuse so much more if you know more stuff, and the transitions from offense to defense are very easy to pull off, and if you can get down transitioning from offense to defense then people will really understand how powerful you are.  The most important thing to realize though is that sometimes you just can't play offensive pyro and get ♥♥♥♥ done effectively, and that's fine.  ---  Also, a question:  Why the shotgun? Just curious. I've always liked the det/flare gun on upward. ",♥
t5_2qh3s,RoundSparrow,1330784481,"I thought it was a good film. It gets at a truth that people don't articulate very well with each other.  Marriage and relationships is a big theme, starting with the 9 year old child.  Love, as a child to parents, or husband to wife - is paradoxical if not grasped in totality.  I feel that, in general, we have severely degraded our ability to discuss how complicated life is.  This has happened progressively - that we have become so entangled in outside reality - that we have lost sense of how complex we are inside.  Mythology played a key role in our ability to relate to this understanding, especially among the deeper thinkers {removing the rule systems of sociological function of mythology}.  You run right up against a paradox that this movie portrays. The totality of life ☯ - and how often the human mind favors structure - and not embracing the complexity of it all.  Marriage in western culture, choice marriage, is central to this expression. At the point of marriage, you are supposed to be a mature adult - and then you are promising a lifetime - what if that person turns out to be bipolar 2 years later?  True Love is a paradox that is supposed to overcome all that - all paths are valid, even if they may not seem to be equal.  In many ways, I find this movie complements well with similar underlying superior truth in *Melancholia* and *A Separation* - of course, few will watch any of these three films, and all benefit from multiple viewings, and well -- all paths are valid, and we have nobody to blame but our self.   The ending is very similar to *A Separation*   There are choices we do make - but in the end, the only real concern is not to get stuck on paradoxes - which are just evidence of our biological brains... sort of like a computer operating system with some know bugs - it's fine to explore them, but people in all classes and situations of life often stumble into them and get stuck in what we would consider a negative way.  This film creates a dialog... about the how Love is itself a cancel of paradox. True Love looks forward, pulls into change, and holding onto the past is not Love (like the woman who goes insane, holding onto the photograph, ignoring change).  Joseph Campbell is your go-to guy on understanding this film's theme... and how hard it is to teach it. I thought the film did a good job in the runtime.  It's not going to appeal to everyone, but it surely connects to some.",☯

t5_2qtjz,bearbeam,1330817551,"Reflections on community, culture and conflict  St. James Episcopal Church (www.stjamesaustin.org) and St. Andrews Presbyterian Church (www.staopen.com) together sponsored a community event for Austin on Thursday, March 1, 2012 at 7:00PM.  The event was held at St. James, and donations went to benefit 5604 Manor, a progressive, community center.  The reader can go to www.thirdcoastactivist.org to see other upcoming presentations.    The headline of this blog was the theme of Ms. Sen's talk.  The presenter was Rinku Sen, the President and Executive Director of the Applied Research Center, publisher of Colorlines.com, an e-zine that contains stories about racism, immigration and other isms that surround us today.  Ms. Sen began her talk by telling about herself.  Her bi-racial came to the U.S. in 1975, and primarily lived in rural, small towns, at times being the only brown face there.  As she described it she lived in many Levitt-towns around America.  Growing up Rinku had one passionate goal: to be an American.  Rinku, like most small children, just wanted to belong and fit in.  When she went to college she reluctantly went to a rally on campus, motivated by a couple of her friends.  The rally and what happened after the rally, radically changed her perspective, because she saw the energy and resulting gains won on behalf of the movement with the university.  Confidently she said that some of the changes are still visible at the school  When asked later by this writer whether this was a major point in her seeing her place in the universe, she responded in the affirmative.   This writer observed Ms. Sen as a very intelligent person under pressure; this blogger has had a lot of public speaking experience, it's a very stressful role, and you have to collect your thoughts quickly and give your own best answer; Rinku did that very effectively and passionately; her effervescence is contagious.  Rinku then moved onto immigration issues. She pointed out three general stereotypes used about immigrants: terrorists, foreigners, and free loaders.  Stereotypes and labels are used to demonize large groups of people.  In short, it's the lazy man or woman's way of denial.  People, whether media journalists, the civilian in the street or politicians, use this tactic to stir up emotions, creating immigrants as straw women or men and the boogeyman behind the cellar door.  They become the puppet-masters that hide below and make the targeted people the 'strangers among us, who have come to take our stuff away.'  She told the story of Mamadou, an immigrant who helped organized restaurant workers after 911.  As Rinku told this story, this writer began to see in much greater clarity that racism always has a hierarchy, and the U.S. has based its collective institutes on a white-structured patriarchal hierarchy of oppression.  For example, as Rinku explained, in the restaurant business there are the up-front workers who are essentially white, have the most interactions with the patrons; they can naturally do this because they speak English whereas many immigrants don't; as a result the 'back of the restaurant workers' are on the steps of the hierarchical ladder.  Rinku mentioned that a friend had told her, “race makes any situation worse.”  Seems to this writer to be a very wise statement based on my own experience of being a perpetrator in the past, and what has observed since my own awakening to my Unaware Racism.  Mamadou was indeed a community activist and organizer and his group went up against a very wealthy man who owned seven restaurants in this community of New York City.  But he and his friends did something else—they were also creating their own community, out of conflict, and that community grew strong because it had to look the conflict straight in the face.  As readers, I hope we are very proud about the accomplishments, and will stand in solidarity.  As she began to include her presentation, Rinku Sen explained her understanding of Racial Justice.  First, Racial Justice equals diversity, but it goes deeper than that—diversity equals variety, thus a multiplicity of ethnicities and cultures.  In her mind there needs to be a distinction between Racial Justice and diversity.  Some would frame Racial Justice this way: it means equality but often includes the notion of sameness.  For most of us who are white, our standard is what we feel we have already have, which is our white privilege, and we continue to perpetuate the standard of “rightness.”  Some of us don't have a clue, because we  feel threatened about this sort of stuff—it's just too messy and generates too much guilt.  Rinku demonstrated four levels of Racism: the first two are micro stages, and the last two are played out on macro levels: 1).  internalized individual biases; 2).  Interpersonal relationships—power here makes a big difference; 3).  Institutional Racism—rules, policies and procedures within organizations, sub-systems, and systems; 4).  Structural—interactions between systems.  These 4 levels or stages are not chronological, but when life is viewed through these lenses such as From Personal Prejudice To Institutional Inequality—From Who's the Racist here, judgment mode To What's causing Racial Inequality Within this Context?  © Christopher Bear-Beam March 2, 2012",©

t5_2qpp6,StephanoFanBoy,1330836406,"1) Recently i have been disappointed by Idra's results, but i think he is actually playing much better than his results show. With his recent practice in Korea and the changes to the group i think he can beat Darkforce, Kas, and Feast and then might take a series off Supernova or Real.   My Korean choice is MC of course...do i even need to explain?  2) The darkhorse of the event will be Nerchio. Looking at his group you can see it looks very daunting at first but i think Nerchio will make it out. From there it will just come down to if he is able to play well in tournament settings at Lan's.  3) Carmac...I'm just a young nerdling and have no access to a credit card/payment method for the pass. I'll watch it anyways but I'd really enjoy the pass ♥. ",♥
t5_2qpp6,Derotide,1330837318,"1) Ret - He's been on a boss run lately, he will do well here too. MMA - We haven't seen a whole lot of him yet this year, since DRG is not coming, MMA is next in line.   2)IdrA - He hasn't been doing great lately, and said that he expected MLG to be his breakout event this year, to show his korean practice, but he didn't do too well, so I think he will be in a good place for this one.   3) You should give me the HD pass, because I bought the MLG winter arena pass, and that was the last of my extra spending cash for awhile since I've been out of work since I had knee surgery recently. ♥ Carmac.

I look for him to give a strong showing even in a tough group * As a big starcraft fan that often follows the pro scene, I would like this pass as much as anyone else here. It would be the highlight for what has been a disappointing year for me so far.  Have a great day ^^ ^^ ♥ Edit: formatting ",♥

To answer your question, we must first ask: ""What is love?"" According to Dr. Nestor Haddaway, love is equivalent to [""baby don't hurt me""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1LG5E55II8). A bit cryptic, yes, but Doctor Haddaway was never too straightforward with his science to begin with, lest his findings be plagiarized or sampled by other Pop-Scientists such as Dean Hammer, or V. Ice, PhD.   According to wikipedia, the average weight of a baby (B) is 3.2 kg. At the time, the term ""don't"" was slang scientific community to mean ""multiply by negative one"". According to my bathroom scale, I (Me) weigh 104.3 kg. (Weight is relative from person to person, as is love. Your mileage may vary.) And as we all know, [love is a measure of electricity.](http://youtu.be/nhPaWIeULKk) Hence, the ""hurt"" (Hz). Therefore, love is:  * (-B * Me) Hz        or * (-1 * 3.2kg * 104.3kg) Hz = -333.76kg/Hz  -333.76kg/Hz is indeed &lt;3. And it is expressed as such^♥.  ",♥

t5_2rof6,factorV,1330971429,"I did some digging on the Yamaha receiver you posted. While it does not have Dolby Volume it has it's own version and they call it **Adaptive DRC**.  While looking for that I also noticed a little blurb about one of the features of the receiver ""Bluetooth (A2DP) compatibility with optional Yamaha Bluetooth® Wireless Audio Receiver YBA-10"" while I do not know exactly what that is referencing it sounds like you could purchase something to get bluetooth connectivity out of it.   I also just want to be clear that I am just going through the list of things that were already posted, I am not checking the prices and looking for alternatives. I am truly sorry but i don't have the time at the moment. Perhaps someone else could but if not I can help with what you already suggested.   I actually have a Harmony One and a Harmony 880, I don't think I could live without them now. Unfortunately the screen on the 880 was cracked when my son dropped a flashlight on it. It still works but that one isn't a touchscreen. The Harmony One is and I do keep that one in my theater and I am a little more careful with it. I have never had a charging issue with either, at some point Logitech started putting magnets on the back charging contacts so that they would always make contact. As long as I keep the dirt off the charge base and the contacts clean everything is okiedokie.   As far as amps/watts/ohms yes, I can't in good conscience ever say that someone can ignore it, however giving the equipment a once over everything looks ok. Someone can look deeper into it and give a better interpretation but I don't think you will have issues.   Oh, as far as android, the beauty of that platform is that there is probably a solution to your issue that could do what you want, and if not one could be made. I don't know of one off the top of my head that I could just recommend and feel comfortable about though. The Yamaha does have some sort of BlueTooth adapter available though, so who knows.   No really, who does know, please tell us. ",®

t5_2s3qj,plus,1330986386,"Few observations wrt search:  Your search algorithm is bogus.  When I search for ""Dawn of War"", I get things like ""Westward® IV: All Aboard"", presumably because the word ""war"" is in ""Westward"".  When searching for ""Deus ex"", I get ""Agricultural Simulator 2011: Extended Edition"", and a billion other results that have ""ex"" somewhere in their name.  Adding games from search is broken.  When I try to add ""Deus Ex: Human Revolution"" after searching for ""Deus"" (not ""Deus Ex"", because it creates so many incorrect results), I get ""No input file specified."" I suspect this is because adding games from the search page bungles the URL.  The URL for DX:HR from the search results is as follows:  http://steamcoin.com/index.php/games/add_to_cart/28050  But the link to add DX:HR by just navigating the list of games until I find it is this:  http://steamcoin.com/games/add_to_cart/28050  Which works, so I end up having to modify the add game URL every time I want to add something from search.  One last thing, you don't seem to have different versions of the same game.  For DX:HR, there is the standard edition and the ""Augmented edition"", which costs $10 more.  However, I see no way to buying the augmented edition.  For comparison, SteamCoin.net allows you to buy the augmented edition (but they have a much worse BTC:USD exchange rate, so I'm using your site).",®

t5_2t3ad,eclipseyue,1331009291,"[Continued]  Makai Kingdom - NIS is fun.  Another SRPG, some replayability if you want everything, has new game+ modes so it's easier at least.  Mana-Khemia: Alchemists of Al-Revis - Alchemy RPG with a good soundtrack and characters.  Turn based battle system, I believe it's a spin off of the Atelier Series.  Marc Ecko's Getting Up: Contents Under Pressure - Action Taggin'.  It's actually better than you'd think, but gets frustrating occasionally.  One section in particular.  Didn't get to play it all the way through, another game I could only ever rent.  Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance - Stealth action, play the first first.  You can play 3 before this as 3 is a prequel to the series, but I don't know why you would.  Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence - usual metal gear fare with a hunger system.  Yes the special edition is worth it.  Metal Slug Anthology - Metal Slug 1-6  Mister Mosquito - You play a moquito.  Guess what you do.  Monster Hunter - Grind fest pokemon, where instead of catching them you kill them all and wear 'em as hats.  And use 'em as swords.  Large monsters, not the friendliest series, and the online was ditched for MHTri for wii and the PSP games.  Slow burn though.  Odin Sphere - 2D side scroll rpg beat'em.  Five heroes but gets pretty repetetive and actually lags a bit.  Okage: Shadow King - RPG is all over this list.  A pretty funny game, but typical rpg fluff either way.  save twice otherwise you lose your save.  Ōkami - Action zelda, with a painting mechanic that actually works pretty decently, has a wii version where instead of button smashing you waggle.  Great looking feudal japan game.  Oni - Rockstar, beat 'em up ghost in the shell game.  Not quite as awesome as ghost in the shell,  but still.  Onimusha: Warlords - 16th century samurai action game.    Onimusha 2: Samurai's Destiny - not as good as one might be passable.  Onimusha 3: Demon Siege - Not as bad as 2, as good as or better than 1.  Onimusha: Dawn of Dreams - I don't...ugh.  I don't know if I dislike this one or 2 more.  I mean they're still good games but it's like taking steps backwwards.  PaRappa the Rapper 2 - Rappin' dog.  Rhythm game that's pretty much the first, though I don't think the soundtracks as good.  Phantom Brave - Use anything you can pick up as a weapon.  Not a grid based strategy rpg for movement, so not like the other NIS games.  Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time - run on walls kill shit never die because REWIND.  Platformer action game that's pretty fun.  Prince of Persia: Warrior Within - better fighting worse platforming, better story than the first.  Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones - best unless you like story  Psi-Ops: The Mindgate Conspiracy - Action Psychic game.  Pick up soldiers. throw 'em into wall, make peoples heads explode, etc etc.  With your psychic powers.  Might actually have an ad supported free pc version and was a fun as fuck game, though pretty short as I remember it.  Radiata Stories - Loads of characters several endings, RPG fare.  Ratchet &amp; Clank - ridiculous platform shooting game.  whole trilogy is worth.  Ratchet &amp; Clank: Going Commando - see above. more stuff.  Ratchet &amp; Clank: Up Your Arsenal! - see above. more stuff and multiplayer.  Ratchet: Deadlocked - pretty much just shooter in this one, but still pretty fun.  Resident Evil Code: Veronica X - Claire and Chris was all I needed.  Also Wesker.  One of the only resident evils I like of the earlier series pre-4  Resident Evil 4 - terrible looking on this particular iteration, quicktime Resident Evil survival horror.  Red Faction - Shooter.  On mars.  Rogue Galaxy - Sci-fi rpg by the guys who did Dark Cloud.  Generic cast/plot, fuck load of side quests and games.  Action based combat, and character battle commands.  Romancing SaGa - Start with 8 characters weird random leveling mechanic, pretty open world once your characters opening is done.  A whole fucking load of systems and shit to try to understand.  Confusing as hell, but fun, but there's less complicated and better.  Rygar: The Legendary Adventure - Remake of the NES game, fight the titans with your bitchin' shield, precursor to the god of war type series of action adventure.  Second Sight - stealth shooter with psychic powers.  Really short.  Shadow Hearts - your main character is fucked up.  that aside an RPG where you can turn into demons.  Pretty solid game pretty dark, but 2 is better.  Battles have revolve a judgement ring timing thing which keeps you paying attention or else you'll get fucked.  Shadow Hearts: Covenant - sequel a little after the first game, with more ridiculous characters, more side quests.  Shadow Hearts: From the New World - Not as dark as the first two.  Pretty standard at this point otherwise.  Shadow of Destiny - Adventure game that was pretty underrated.  prevent your own death.  Shadow of the Colossus - 16 colossi to kill. that's it. you and them.  And they are fucking HUGE.  A mandatory game to me for the system.  Shin Megami Tensei: Digital Devil Saga - I don't know how to even keep all of these SMT games straight, so they're all sort of jumbled in your head.  Demons and RPG goodness, every one of them.  Shin Megami Tensei: Digital Devil Saga 2 - see above  Shin Megami Tensei: Nocturne - see above  Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 3 FES - see above  Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 4 - see above  Silent Hill 2 - not related to the first game, great in every respect.  And the only silent hill I actually liked. survival horror  Silent Hill 3 - sequel to the first standard survival horror fare.  Silent Hill 4: The Room - I think this was liked?  only included on the list because I can't actually remember.  which says a lot.  Sky Odyssey - flight sim where you search for measure.  Pretty fun.  SkyGunner - flight combat.  Ace combat but easier with a manga sort of aesthetic.  Controls are great, wish I actually had the game and again, didn't have to rent it.  Sly Cooper and the Thievius Raccoonus - Platformer, fun easy game with good humour.  Sly 2: Band of Thieves - not as good as the other ones but still pretty decent, and two other playable characters.  Sly 3: Honor Among Thieves - the best of the series with coop!  Sniper Elite - ""Realistic"" sniping sim.  Unforgiving, looks ugly, also on the pc.  Compensate for wind, Coriolis Effect and such on the latter difficulties.  Soul Calibur II - Only good soul calibur in my opinion.  Fighting game.  Soul Nomad - More SRPG more NIS games with a pretty good story.  SSX Tricky - Everyone who loves snowboarding loves it because of this game.  True facts.  Great game.  SSX3 - The one that everyone forgets but is better than Tricky.  Tricky was just more well known and played I think..  Star Ocean: Till the End of Time - Standard RPG that has a little bit of a slow grind.  Star Wars Battlefront II - Third person shooter, with classes, units and such.  Pretty great Star Wars game with huge battles.  Steambot Chronicles - RPG that lets you play good or eveil without having to choose via text like modern games.  Steampunk era, where you can do whatever you want really.  Has some technical issues.  Suikoden V - 108 characters, slow burn, RPG standard for the series.    Syphon Filter Dark Mirror - I feel like people don't even remember this series existed (Considering Omega Strain was the previous one it's not suprsinging)  No online which is sad from the psp version.  The Sword of Etheria - Hacknslach goodness again.  Air combos all over.  Tales of Legendia - Action RPG without super attacks or multiplayer.  A lacklsuter bit of the Tales series but still ok.  Tales of the Abyss - Action RPG, with a decent sized group, and has special moves unlike above.  Tenchu: Wrath of Heaven - Stealth.  You are a ninja.  TimeSplitters - FPS that people for some reason seem to have forgotten despite it being great along with its squel.  TimeSplitters 2 - Another fucking great FPS.    Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 - I love the regular skateboardan' of THPS1/2 but I still prefer 3 to this day.  Viewtiful Joe - platformer beat 'em up with video effect powers bullet time superspeed.  Viewtiful Joe 2 - two playable characters this time!  We ♥ Katamari - More of the same.  This is not a bad thing.  Wild ARMs 3 - I Wild West RPG, new game+.  This series is great up this game, and the wild west setting is awesome.  Xenosaga Episode I: Der Wille zur Macht - It's not Xenogears, but is a ""prequel"".  Cutscenes all over the fucking place, so if that's not your thing be wary. RPG, with a card game, wish it was xenogears.  Xenosaga Episode II: Jenseits von Gut und Böse - you only play it for the story.  Xenosaga Episode III: Also sprach Zarathustra - This ones at least fun again to play!  X-Men Legends - Squad based RPG where you play the x-men and have combos with your team.  Long ass load times, and the next one...  X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse - Same as above with more characters.  Yakuza - Beat 'em up with enviromental weapons, xp used for upgrading health and moves.  Yakuza 2 - See above.  Zone of the Enders - Third person mech combat with a fun multiplayer.  Action orientated fun game and is mandatory only because the sequel which is better references the first.  you know if you're into plot in games.  Otherwise it's all Hideo Kojima (Metal Gear) babble.  Zone of the Enders: The 2nd Runner - See above.",♥

That means that I'll have the most important voice, being that it's the one people see first. If you downvote it five times, it becomes the lowest comment and risks being hidden. A hidden comment may as well be censorship, as the only comments hidden are usually trolls or shitposters. Karma directly correlates with how many people will see your comment or submission.   - Long-term reputation. Especially in subreddits which focus on the user behind the username (/r/snackexchange, /r/penpals, the local subreddits, /r/assistance, etc), karma shows that you're a contributing member of the website.

t5_2qh1i,sodhi,1331047348,"&gt;After work on Consolas had begun, Luc(as) was asked to also supply a proposal for a sans serif. Starting from some sketches he had once made with TV broadcasting in mind, De Groot drew a contemporary sans serif family with subtle roundings on stems and corners.  However, as the roundings seemed to suffer under ClearType rendering, De Groot redesigned the font, taking out the rounded corners. When submitting the proposal to Microsoft, he sent along a sample of the original version, adding: ‘I like the look of it, but as you see these rounded tops look real ugly in ClearType; don’t choose this.’ De Groot had in fact been critical of the ClearType rasterizer when he first saw it demonstrated. &gt; &gt;To his astonishment, Microsoft chose the rounded version. ‘As I soon found out, the rasterizer had indeed improved, and rounded tops and bottoms could be rendered smoothly now.’ &gt; &gt;Calibri’s proportions allow high impact in tightly set lines of big and small text alike. Calibri’s many curves and the new rasterizer team up in bigger sizes to reveal a warm and soft character. Calibri turned out to be one of the most flexible font families of the new Collection. It was selected to be the default font in Microsoft Office® applications such as Word and PowerPoint®. As the de facto replacement of Times New Roman in these programs, it is quickly turning into one of the most used fonts on the planet.",®

Otherwise 'LEGO' is supposed to be used as an adjective. Thus, when referring to the pieces, neither 'lego' nor 'legos' is correct... rather one should say: 'LEGO bricks' or 'LEGO pieces' or whatever (using LEGO as an adjective -- and one should really capitalize all of the letters, and put the little 'circle-R' symbol after it (®)). This is all a matter of protecting the trademark of 'LEGO' for the company (using it otherwise degenerates the strength of the trademark).

You said you're computer illiterate and, despite the fact that it's not hard, it's definitely not a walk in the park if you don't know anything about computers.  I am a professional software engineer and use dells at home and at work. If it makes me a tool, then so be it. I broke something? They overnight it next day without any questions asked. There are some low points with dell that I've had but it's just been EASY.   You said you had the complete care plan. When you build a computer and something goes wrong, you have the scour the internet to find a solution and, judging by what you said, that might not be as easy for you as it is for others.   Just a thought :)  My suggestion would be to go here: http://www.dell.com/us/p/popular-desktop-deals   Stay away from the slim towers or the all-in-ones. You want to shoot for an i5 or better. You can google reviews of the graphics cards - you will also want a card with a name (made by AMD or Nvidia) instead of the Intel® HD Graphics.   Best Buy has dells on sale, but I would always always suggest going ONLY to look at models, find what you like, then buy it online and get a warranty to go with it. Buying computers in stores is just a shitty idea because the only thing Best Buy is going to offer you is the Geek Squad, which is overpriced and subpar.  If you have other questions just let me know. Would be glad to help.",®

t5_2qh2p,Losgunn,1331083326,"The word μισεῖ in Greek translates to ""hates"". Sure, it can also mean ""detests"", depending on how how close in accuracy you want to get to the source material - that source material being Luke 14:26. Here it is in Greek:  εἴ τις ἔρχεται πρός με καὶ οὐ μισεῖ τὸν πατέρα ἑαυτοῦ καὶ τὴν μητέρα καὶ τὴν γυναῖκα καὶ τὰ τέκνα καὶ τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς καὶ τὰς ἀδελφὰς ἔτι τε καὶ τὴν ψυχὴν ἑαυτοῦ, οὐ δύναται εἶναι μου μαθητής.  Remember, the word that translates to ""hate"" is μισεῖ. This word occurs seven times in the Bible, according to the Englishman's Concordance(besides Luke 14:26, it also appears in John 3:20, John 7:7, John 15:18, John 15:19, John 15:23, and 1 John 3:13), and all seven times it is translated as ""hate"", ""hates"", and ""hateth"" in the New American Standard, King James with Strong's Concordance, and Biblos Interlinear translations.   Luke 14:26 is most often quoted from the King James translation, which is ""If any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple."" To be fair, I thought I'd post this exact verse from some other available translations to see how they might differ, with the appropriate word bolded to show any differences.  **New International Version**  ""If anyone comes to me and does not **hate** his father and mother, his wife and children, his brothers and sisters—yes, even his own life—he cannot be my disciple.""  **New Living Translation**  ""If you want to be my disciple, you must **hate** everyone else by comparison - your father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters - yes, even your own life. Otherwise, you cannot be my disciple.""  **English Standard Version**  ""If anyone comes to me and does not **hate** his own father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters, yes, and even his own life, he cannot be my disciple.""  **New American Standard**  ""If anyone comes to Me, and does not **hate** his own father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters, yes, and even his own life, he cannot be My disciple.""  **International Standard Version**  ""If anyone comes to me and does not **hate** his father, mother, wife, children, brothers, and sisters, as well as his own life, he can't be my disciple.""  **God's Word® Translation**  ""If people come to me and are not ready to **abandon** their fathers, mothers, wives, children, brothers, and sisters, as well as their own lives, they cannot be my disciples.""  You get the picture. Remember, this all stems from the word μισεῖ, which is literally translated as ""hate"". There are several translations that show that this word is nearly always translated to ""hate"", except for when it is translated to ""abandon"", which is not equivalent to ""love less"". Whether you choose to translate it as ""hate"" or as ""abandon"", neither means that you ""don't hate your family, you just love God MORE"". So take it easy on KylesMomIsABitch, because they probably knew this and just didn't feel like posting all of this info, or didn't have the time. I did, and I did, so you could have your evidence.

I tell you the truth, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished.  Which means the laws of the Old Testament still apply, since the earth has not disappeared. Meaning Leviticus 20:13 is still applicable.   Parallel Translations:  **New International Version**  If a man lies with a man as one lies with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable. They must be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads.  **New Living Translation**  If a man practices homosexuality, having sex with another man as with a woman, both men have committed a detestable act. They must both be put to death, for they are guilty of a capital offense.   **English Standard Version**  If a man lies with a male as with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination; they shall surely be put to death; their blood is upon them.   **New American Standard Bible**  If there is a man who lies with a male as those who lie with a woman, both of them have committed a detestable act; they shall surely be put to death. Their bloodguiltiness is upon them.   **King James Bible** (Cambridge Ed.)  If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.   **GOD'S WORD® Translation**  When a man has sexual intercourse with another man as with a woman, both men are doing something disgusting and must be put to death. They deserve to die.   **King James 2000 Bible**  If a man also lies with a man, as he lies with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.   **American King James Version**  If a man also lie with mankind, as he lies with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be on them.   **American Standard Version**  And if a man lie with mankind, as with womankind, both of them have committed abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.   **Douay-Rheims Bible**  If any one lie with a man se with a woman, both have committed an abomination, let them be put to death: their blood be upon them.   **Darby Bible Translation**  And if a man lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: they shall certainly be put to death; their blood is upon them.   **English Revised Version**  And if a man lie with mankind, as with womankind, both of them have committed abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.   **Webster's Bible Translation**  If a man also shall lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.   **World English Bible**  If a man lies with a male, as with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.   **Young's Literal Translation**  And a man who lieth with a male as one lieth with a woman; abomination both of them have done; they are certainly put to death; their blood is on them.  Parallel Commentaries:  **Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible**  If a man lie also with mankind, as he lieth with a woman,.... Is guilty of the sin of sodomy, this is a breach of the law in Leviticus 18:22, both of them have committed an abomination; he that lies, and he that is lain with, both consenting to perpetrate the abominable wickedness; which may well be called an abomination, being contrary to nature, and more than brutish, for nothing of that kind is to be found among brutes:  they shall surely be put to death; if he that is lain with is not forced, as Aben Ezra observes:  their blood shall be upon them; be slain by stoning, as the above Targum.  **Geneva Study Bible**  If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.   **Wesley's Notes**  20:13 Put to death - Except the one party was forced by the other.

They determine their course of action based on their interpretation of the bible. Which leads to...  -The issue of not accepting blood transfusions, while part of the doctrine, is a personal responsibility that individuals cover with their physicians well before any emergency. This includes in some cases wearing bracelets that identify their wishes, highly detailed medical directives, and pre-screening their personal physicians for how they would handle medical emergencies. They only take an active position on this when a doctor refuses to honor their wishes and medical directives after already agreeing to do so. *(I know there's case law that can confirm this, but I'm not a lawyer.)*  This also inadvertently leads to an interesting observation: with a little planning, a lot of clear thinking and honest dialogue, none of the law-making or rhetoric is necessary, as this becomes an issue of personal culpability and responsibility instead of creating a need for government interference.   (°ロ°)☝One more thing...  There's a time and place to involve the government; but my concern in this regard (and by extension, my concern with Rep.

t5_2qh3l,WodniwTnuocsid,1331175016," As recommended by EFSA, an appropriate and relevant statistical analysis is crucial. It should follow the following series of steps, allowing the use of several methods depending on the questions raised:      • Obtaining and modeling the growth curves and feed consumption, assessed by non-linear regression, validation, and statistical comparisons in order to test if the curves are significantly different, thus taking into account individual variability. This necessitates the use of time series analysis, selection models, and non-parametric tests, Akaike Information Criteria and related methods. Water consumption should also be an important factor to follow-up and therefore better understand kidney and urine data.      • The study of dose-response predictions using non-linear regression should be the goal, but the only two doses generally used in these tests do not make it possible to evidence linearity as we indicated. Moreover, in the cases where there are not dose-related trends or relationships using the two doses mentioned, the absence of linear dose-response curves cannot be a reason to neglect the effects. For instance, as previously cited, U or J curves may be characteristic of endocrine effects [37], and spiky irregular curves may be detected in carcinogenesis.      • Simultaneous analysis of all observed variables: multivariate data analysis, principal component analysis, correlations analysis, factorial analysis and clustering      • Multivariate comparisons of the different variables: hypothesis testing, multiple ways ANOVA, MANOVA, and others to determinate if the groups differ relative to the different questions: specific GMO effect or diet effect per se. To evidence a detail, when comparing two mean values, SEM should be calculated to determine confidence intervals; however, SD have been used up to now by the company for MON863 and NK603 files for instance.      Apart from empirical curves in some instances, ANOVA and univariate hypothesis testing only the GMO effect, none of the other statistical approaches is currently used nor requested by the authorities.      **Human tests and post-market monitoring**     *For the record, it must be said that very few tests on humans have been carried out up to now. Moreover, epidemiological studies are not feasible in America, since there is no organized traceability of GMOs anywhere on the continent, where, by far, most of edible GMOs are cultivated (97%).* **As a consequence, a post-market monitoring (PMM) is offered to the population.** The Cartagena Biosafety Protocol identifying GMOs at the borders of a country has now been signed by over 150 countries, including the member states of the European Union. PMM may have some value in detecting unexpected adverse effects. It could therefore be considered as a routine need. This approach makes it possible to collect information related to risk management. It can be relied upon as a technique for monitoring adverse events or other health outcomes related to the consumption of GM plant-derived foods, provided that the Toxotest approach, together with the SSC method, should have already been applied. The PMM should be linked with the possibility of detecting allergenicity reactions to GMOs in routine medicine, thanks to the very same routine cutaneous tests that should be developed prior to large-scale commercialization. A screening of serum banks of patients with allergies could be also put forward in order to search for antibodies against the main GMOs and not only their transgenic proteins, since they may induce secondary allergenic metabolites in the plant not visible in the substantial equivalence study.      **The traceability of products from animals fed on GMOs is also crucial. The reason for this is because they can develop chronic diseases which are not utterly known today. Such possible diseases could be linked to the hepatorenal toxicity observed in some GMO-related cases (Table 1).**      **Moreover, labeling animals fed on GMOs is therefore necessary because some pesticide residues linked to GMOs could pass into the food chain and also because nobody would want to eat disabled or physiologically modified animals after long-term GMOs ingestion, even if pesticides residues or DNA fragments are not toxic nor transmitted by themselves.**      **Conclusion**     Transcriptomics, proteomics and other related methods are not ready yet for routine use in the laboratories, and moreover they may be inappropriate for studying toxicity in animals, and could not in any way replace in vivo studies with all the physiological and biochemical parameters that are measured with organs weight, appearance, and histology. By contrast, afterwards, new approaches could well help to explain pathological results or action mechanisms of pesticides present in the GM plants or GM-fed animals, if found.      To obtain the transparency of raw data (including rat blood analyses) for toxicological tests, maintained illegally confidential, is crucial. It has also become crucial to apply objective criteria of interpretation like the criteria described here: sex-specific side effects or non-linear ones. Such data can be put online on the EFSA website with a view to provide a fuller review to the wider scientific community, and in order to better inform the citizen to make biotechnologies more socially acceptable. Since fundamental research is published on a regular basis, it should be the same for this kind of applied research on long-term health effects, as suggested by the CE/2001/18 and the corresponding 1829/2003 regulations.      **We can conclude, from the regulatory tests performed today, that it is unacceptable to submit 500 million Europeans and several billions of consumers worldwide to the new pesticide GM-derived foods or feed, this being done without more controls (if any) than the only 3-month-long toxicological tests and using only one mammalian species, especially since there is growing evidence of concern (Tables 1 and 2).** This is why we propose to improve the protocol of the 90-day studies to 2-year studies with mature rats, using the Toxotest approach, which should be rendered obligatory, and including sexual hormones assessment too. The reproductive, developmental, and transgenerational studies should also be performed. The new SSC statistical method of analysis is proposed in addition. This should not be optional if the plant is designed to contain a pesticide (as it is the case for more than 99% of cultivated commercialized GMOs), whilst for others, depending on the inserted trait, a case-by-case approach in the method to study toxicity will be necessary.     © 2011 Séralini et al; licensee Springer.

t5_2sokd,michaelmacmanus,1331253520,"&gt; I can't stand altruistic, unrealistic liberalism  Funny.  To me the end game for true *current* libertarianism is also an unrealistic altruism with the invisible deity-like hand of the Free Market® guiding us to a utopia, or at the very least a Bentham-esque utilitarian society that benefits the most amount of people possible at all times.  It's interesting to note that as I started taking my econ classes - half my class population identified as Libertarian, with JMK being the ultimate evil.  I started around 08' - the first time Paul became seriously en vogue.  As I marched closer towards my degree that population swiftly dwindled as libertarianism - even from Friedman's standpoint - had drifted into a childlike fantasy.  Even Milton himself, the Jesus of libertarianism espoused virtues of having a government, supporting the lower class, and self identified as a ""classic liberal.""  Then along came Rand, Greenspan, and their ilk to morph libertarianism into some sort of caricature of what it originally entailed.  This seems to be what most self identifying right wing voters that claim libertarianism cling to.  This mutilated version of little to no government, blaming the left and the poor for their lot in life, and everything else that ails seems to have prevailed.    The far left think business can't be trusted.  The far right think government can't be trusted.  The center knows that no one can be trusted.  Hence you'll find the strongest nations in the world in terms of economic development and HDI ranking (Germany, Australia, Canada, Norway, United States, etc) directly in the center.  Strong corporations.  Strong social services.  The balancing act is just a lot trickier in the States since so much of the budget is devoted to the military - which unfortunately for the most part is a necessary evil to keep commerce as stable as it is in the world.  It's a difficult game and a constant balancing act.  Anyone that identifies as a specific party member or side and tries to form their ideology around that has simply given up attempting to learn.  That's why most young people start out liberal - because the social causes that progressives champion are so transparent in their good.  Why should people be persecuted based on sexual preference?  Why should we enforce laws based on xenophobia?  Why does this drug prohibition still exist when it's been proven time and again that it's a failure?  So they'll naturally cling to social economics as well because it's an expedient line of thought.  As you grow older you just want your money.   You become cynical and jaded and ultimately lackadaisical in your support of a better world.  You're no longer suckling at your parents teet so now money has taken on a tangible meaning to you. You just want what you feel is yours.  So you support policies that purport to have that interest - even if with a tiny bit of research and learning you can see how in reality they'll end up doing more harm than good.",®

As far as TJ models it would be a Sahara.   Rubicon:       Change zip code for local offers and pricing.            included in base price      17-Inch Satin Carbon Painted Wheels     Tru-Lok® Front and Rear Locking Differentials+     Rock-Trac® Heavy-Duty Transfer Case+     Electronic Sway Bar Disconnect     Dana® Front Axle+     Rock Rails      Gas Charged Shocks     32-Inch BFGoodrich® Mud Terrain Tires+     1 Year of SiriusXM Satellite Radio Svc.+     Seven Infinity® Speaker, Including Subwoofer+     368-Watt Amplifier     115-Volt Auxiliary Power Outlet  This is the off road model although all Jeeps are able to be taken off road the Rubicon includes extra stuff (such as lockers) that makes offroading easier and even some off road parks require lockers for the more advanced trails.  Again TJ model would be Rubicon.   It should be noted that I noticed a general attitude that if you are going to mod the Jeep to get a Sport or Sport S as it has a cheaper base price and most people who mod their Jeeps upgrade to the same level or better then what the Rubicon has.   Anyways, I am sure some one who has more knowledge then me will give a better answer.   Edit: Fixed some details about the Sahara, about the roof, still a IIRC though.   Edit 2: I'm not sure if this is what you were looking for going though it,   This is the main difference The tires, lift, whats included, and in the case of the Rubicon comes out of the factory ready for more advanced trails. The Sport and Sport S should be pretty basic rides and still will be capable, the Sahara is meant more for the driver who spends more time commuting then in the trail, the well the Rubicon is for the trail.    I personally own a 2000 SE, and I enjoy the heck out of it, it doesn't have anything fancy but still a fun ride, so don't let a lack of features discourage you from Sport or Sport S, if AC is a must, I think you can add AC to a Sport.  Also I would see if you could test drive a Jeep with a hard top and a soft top, the soft tops are more noisy but it's easier to take down for good weather, where as the hard tops are more quite you can use the freedom top for the front passenger and driver to get some fresh air in, and a bit more ""secure"" as far as what people need to do to break in (break glass opposed to just undoing a side panel)",®

t5_2qh1e,normalboy,1331408379,"&gt;Who the fuck do you think is going to bother drawing stupid comics for you guys to make memes out of, if all you ever do is rehost them on imgur with the watermark removed?  But the thing is, if you look at places like 4chan, watermarks are discouraged. Greatly discouraged. You will be trolled and saged into oblivion if you pull that shit. Does anyone even remember ""©Jaxx"" or ""ORIGINAL CHARACTER, DO NOT STEAL"" (even though really that was just a sonic character with a diff color scheme and not entirely the same thing)?  Not that I'm discrediting your entire argument, I agree with pretty much the rest of what you're saying, but since around 2004 pretty much, 4chan has been gradually discouraging any non-anonymous behavior. And it's funny cuz I've heard that exact argument before ON 4chan where people are like ""God reddit, way to take credit for something that isn't yours by removing the artist's watermarks"" and then the next thread down someone is posting some content they made with their watermark on it and it's all ""gtfo namefag, &gt;2012, &gt;using watermarks, ISHYGDDT"", etc.  And from that perspective it more sounds like it's Anonymous saying ""It's okay if WE do it, but no one else"".

t5_2rfxx,LullabyGaming,1331420600,"Well music is one of the things that highly affect your stream ""quality"" for a lot of people. And your music choices are very good I must say, there's not many people that don't like what music you listen to. There's some of these streamers who play only dubstep and not everyone likes that.  I honestly can't say much what would improve your stream, because as of now it already is the best there is, in my opinion of course.  There's a few things I'd like you to do more though. I like how you often start to speak about a subject, such as ""ELO Hell"" and then you quit saying you shouldn't be ranting about these things. You absolutely should. You wouldn't believe how many people listen to you.  You probably should do some fan games. I'm sorry if you're doing this and I have just missed them, but things like ARAB or just custom 5v5 or Dominion with fans would be good, not just from a fan standpoint but I feel like the people who do this increase their fanbase by people recording these games and streaming these games etc.  Other than this? Not really. Keep up the good work! Hope you rise to the daily 30k viewers :D You would deserve it ♥",♥

If God didn't make us sick, then instead of staying home in bed, we would have went out on the same road as a drunk driver and gotten killed. God just made you sick to save your life. It almost makes sense until you consider the fact that ""God"" was the one who put that drunk driver there in the first place. Fucking convoluted ""logic""...  Edit: Someone posted it on Facebook again, so here it is:  &gt; Sometimes I ask God why did he let certain things happen. But, now I know, there's always was reason....  &gt;Me: God, can I ask You a question?  &gt;God: Sure.  &gt;Me: Promise You won't get mad?  &gt;God: I promise.  &gt;Me: Why did You let so much stuff happen to me today?  &gt;God: What do you mean?  &gt;Me: Well, I woke up late.  &gt;God: Yes  &gt;Me: My car took forever to start.  &gt;God: Okay.  &gt;Me: At lunch, they made my sandwich wrong &amp; I had to wait...  &gt;God: Hmmmmm.  &gt;Me: On the way home, my phone went DEAD, just as I picked up a call.  &gt;God: All right.  &gt;Me: And on top of it all off, when I got home, I just want to soak my feet in my new foot massager &amp; relax. BUT it wouldn't work!!! Nothing went right today! Why did You do that?  &gt;God: Let me see, the death angel was at your bed this morning &amp; I had to send one of My Angels to battle him for your life. I let you sleep through that.  &gt;Me (humbled): OH  &gt;GOD: I didn't let your car start because there was a drunk driver on your route that would have hit you if you were on the road.  &gt;Me: (ashamed)  &gt;God: The first person who made your sandwich today was sick &amp; I didn't want you to catch what they have, I knew you couldn't afford to miss work.  &gt;Me (embarrassed): Okay.  &gt;God: Your phone went dead bcuz the person that was calling was going to give false witness about what you said on that call, I didn't even let you talk to them so you would be covered.  &gt;Me (softly): I see God. &gt;God: Oh and that foot massager, it had a short that would knock out all of the power in your house tonight. I didn't think you wanted to be in the dark.  &gt;Me: I'm Sorry God  &gt;God: Don't be sorry, just learn to Trust Me.... in All things , the Good &amp; the bad.  &gt;Me: I will trust You.  &gt;God: And don't doubt that My plan for your day is Always Better than your plan.  &gt;Me: I won't God. And let me just tell you God, Thank You for Everything today.  &gt;God: You're welcome child.

t5_2sigz,oceanic_overlord,1331513046,"There are several different flat-out-crisis-in-the-moment strategies typically suggested. My favorite is doing anything that isn't SI and produces intense sensation: squeezing ice, taking a cold bath or hot or cold shower, biting into something strongly flavored (hot peppers, ginger root, unpeeled lemon/lime/grapefruit), rubbing Ben-Gay® or Icy-Hot® or Vap-O-Rub® under your nose, sex, etc. Matching reactions and feelings is extremely useful.  These strategies work because the intense emotions that provoke SI are transient; they come and go like waves, and if you can stay upright through one, you get some breathing room before the next (and you strengthen your muscles). The more waves you tolerate without falling over, the stronger you become.  But, the question arises, aren't these things equivalent to punishing yourself by cutting or burning or hitting or whatever? The key difference is that they don't produce lasting results. If you squeeze a handful of ice until it melts or stick a couple of fingers into some ice cream for a few minutes, it'll hurt like (to quote someone I respect) ""a cast-iron bitch"" but it won't leave scars. It won't leave anything you'll have to explain away later. You most likely won't feel guilty after -- a little foolish, maybe, and kinda proud that you weathered a crisis without SI, but not guilty.  This kind of distraction isn't intended to cure the roots of your self-injury; you can't run a marathon when you're too tired to cross the room. These techniques serve, rather, to help you get through an intense moment of badness without making things worse for yourself in the long run. They're training wheels, and they teach you that you can get through a crisis without hurting yourself. You will refine them, even devise more productive coping mechanisms, later, as the urge to self-injure lessens and loses the hold it has on your life. Use these interim methods to demonstrate to yourself that you can cope with distress without permanently injuring your body. Every time you do you score another point and you make SI that much less likely next time you're in crisis.  Your first task when you've decided to stop is to break the cycle, to force yourself to try new coping mechanisms. And you do have to force yourself to do this; it doesn't just come. You can't theorize about new coping techniques until one day they're all in place and your life is changed. You have to work, to struggle, to make yourself do different things. When you pick up that knife or that lighter or get ready to hit that wall, you have to make a conscious decision to do something else. At first, the something else will be a gut-level primitive, maybe even punishing thing, and that's okay -- the important thing is that you made the decision, you chose to do something else. Even if you don't make that decision the next time, nothing can take away that moment of mastery, of having decided that you were not going to do it that time. If you choose to hurt yourself in the next crisis time, you will know that it is a choice, which implies the existence of alternative choices. It takes the helplessness out of the equation.  So what do I do instead? Many people try substitute activities as described above and report that sometimes they work, sometimes not. One way to increase the chances of a distraction/substitution helping calm the urge to harm is to match what you do to how you are feeling at the moment.  First, take a few moments and look behind the urge. What are you feeling? Are you angry? Frustrated? Restless? Sad? Craving the feeling of SI? Depersonalized and unreal or numb? Unfocused?  Next, match the activity to the feeling. A few examples:  angry, frustrated, restless     Try something physical and violent, something not directed at a living thing:     Slash an empty plastic soda bottle or a piece of heavy cardboard or an old shirt or sock.     Make a soft cloth doll to represent the things you are angry at. Cut and tear it instead of yourself.     Flatten aluminum cans for recycling, seeing how fast you can go.     Hit a punching bag.     Use a pillow to hit a wall, pillow-fight style.     Rip up an old newspaper or phone book.     On a sketch or photo of yourself, mark in red ink what you want to do. Cut and tear the picture.     Make Play-Doh or Sculpey or other clay models and cut or smash them.     Throw ice into the bathtub or against a brick wall hard enough to shatter it.     Break sticks.     I've found that these things work even better if I rant at the thing I am cutting/tearing/hitting. I start out slowly, explaining why I am hurt and angry, but sometimes end up swearing and crying and yelling. It helps a lot to vent like that.     Crank up the music and dance.     Clean your room (or your whole house).     Go for a walk/jog/run.     Stomp around in heavy shoes.     Play handball or tennis.  sad, soft, melancholy, depressed, unhappy     Do something slow and soothing, like taking a hot bath with bath oil or bubbles, curling up under a comforter with hot cocoa and a good book, babying yourself somehow. Do whatever makes you feel taken care of and comforted. Light sweet-smelling incense. Listen to soothing music. Smooth nice body lotion into the parts or yourself you want to hurt. Call a friend and just talk about things that you like. Make a tray of special treats and tuck yourself into bed with it and watch TV or read. Visit a friend. craving sensation, feeling depersonalized, dissociating, feeling unreal     Do something that creates a sharp physical sensation:     Squeeze ice hard (this really hurts). (Note: putting ice on a spot you want to burn gives you a strong painful sensation and leaves a red mark afterward, kind of like burning would.)     Put a finger into a frozen food (like ice cream) for a minute.     Bite into a hot pepper or chew a piece of ginger root.     Rub liniment under your nose.     Slap a tabletop hard.     Snap your wrist with a rubber band.     Take a cold bath.     Stomp your feet on the ground.     Focus on how it feels to breathe. Notice the way your chest and stomach move with each breath.     [NOTE: Some people report that being online while dissociating increases their sense of unreality; be cautious about logging on in a dissociative state until you know how it affects you.] wanting focus     Do a task (a computer game like tetris or minesweeper, writing a computer program, needlework, etc) that is exacting and requires focus and concentration.     Eat a raisin mindfully. Pick it up, noticing how it feels in your hand. Look at it carefully; see the asymmetries and think about the changes the grape went through. Roll the raisin in your fingers and notice the texture; try to describe it. Bring the raisin up to your mouth, paying attention to how it feels to move your hand that way. Smell the raisin; what does it remind you of? How does a raisin smell? Notice that you're beginning to salivate, and see how that feels. Open your mouth and put the raisin in, taking time to think about how the raisin feels to your tongue. Chew slowly, noticing how the texture and even the taste of the raisin change as you chew it. Are there little seeds or stems? How is the inside different from the outside? Finally, swallow.     Choose an object in the room. Examine it carefully and then write as detailed a description of it as you can. Include everything: size, weight, texture, shape, color, possible uses, feel, etc.     Choose a random object, like a paper clip, and try to list 30 different uses for it.     Pick a subject and research it on the web.     Try some of the games and distractions at digibeet's page; she's assembled a lot of distractions. wanting to see blood     Draw on yourself with a red felt-tip pen.     Take a small bottle of liquid red food coloring and warm it slightly by dropping it into a cup of hot water for a few minutes. Uncap the bottle and press its tip against the place you want to cut. Draw the bottle in a cutting motion while squeezing it slightly to let the food color trickle out.     Draw on the areas you want to cut using ice that you've made by dropping six or seven drops of red food color into each of the ice-cube tray wells.     Paint yourself with red tempera paint. wanting to see scars or pick scabs     Get a henna tattoo kit. You put the henna on as a paste and leave it overnight; the next day you can pick it off as you would a scab and it leaves an orange-red mark behind.  Another thing that helps sometimes is the fifteen-minute game. Tell yourself that if you still want to harm yourself in 15 minutes, you can. When the time is up, see if you can go another 15. I've been able to get through a whole night that way before. I tried all of that. I still want to hurt myself. Sometimes you will make a good-faith effort to keep from harming yourself but nothing seems to work. You've slashed a bottle, your hand is numb from the ice, and the urge is still twisting you into knots. You feel that if you don't harm yourself, you'll explode. What now? ",®

t5_2qh1i,Kodiak_Cartel,1331521676,"When I was in college, My 22nd birthday was spent drinking. All day I was drinking. I polished off, over a period of about 18 hours, a Heineken Draughtkeg and a bottle of Southern Comfort. While walking through my Fraternity house hallway, I tripped over a speaker cable (we had huge house speakers for parties) and spilled my beer all over this chick while also knocking her to the ground. I apologized profusely and offered her a nice beer from my fridge, seeing as she was now drinkless. Well, I got back to my room with her in tow and as I was reading the different types of beer she could choose from, I heard my door close and the lock click.   Before I can turn all the way around, she already has her hands down my pants. I went into panic mode and decided to just go with the flow. I had her on my couch, Shirt off, pants off, bra off, panties halfway off, when my brain said to me ""Excuse me, Kodiak_cartel? You want to stand up and assess your current situation?""  I did so and realized that this chick was a total bridge troll. Not only that, but as I stood with her panties in hand, I contemplatively gazed at her pussy and, upon closer inspection, realized that I was ridden with herpes sores. I managed to get a ""I'll brb. Gotta get a condom"" and just peaced out, went to a different party and went back home an hour later.   Well, I turns out she waited for me that whole time, and finally got tired of waiting as I was returning. Well, she was pissed, saw me and, still naked, fat and sweaty, chased after me. I finally took refuge in the above ground pool in our courtyard and hid under the water while breathing through some straws I grabbed from a couple empty drinks.   A week later, we found her underwear in a bush in our side yard, complete with wallet, id and phone. We had our house advisor send her an email to pick it all up, but she never showed.    **TL;DR** Almost wrote myself a drunken, lifetime prescription for Valtrex©",©

I don't understand what point you're trying to make when you say: I'll stick by them as long as they don't turn them into shitty pcs. What does this have to do with anything?   You think they are the only console that still cares about games &amp; the experience. Could you please explain to a blithering idiot like myself why you believe this? You could have picked any console (X-box or Playstation) &amp; made the same points &amp; no one would have called you on it because those consoles don't sit on their ass, re-package the game, &amp; sell it to you. I think it would be great if Nintendo would turn into a ""mediocre pc"" - **IT WOULD STILL HAVE BETTER GRAPHICS**- &amp; you wouldn't need to spend hundreds of $£€ **extra** just to buy the ridiculously overpriced ""accessories"". These btw are just ridiculous. Have you seen how many different ""accessories"" there are for the WII ? Every new Nintendo game comes with its' own ""accessories"" that are horribly overpriced &amp; utterly pointless. You're paying minimum 20$£€ for miniature plastic rackets, golf clubs, sword, gun, &amp; those are the ones that make sense. Have you seen the retarded ones they sell. Or the ""games"" (don't know if you can call them that) they make just so you have to buy that expensive accessory to use it. This would be fine if the game was actually worth it, but just for doing yoga? The only thing the board does, that you can't do on your own is what? Keep track of your weight? Well that's money well spent I say :P  The original point was that they are (imo) much worse then companies like E.A as far as ripping off the customer with the whole DLC thing. Nintendo is the worst example you could have given. **They actually sell the controller IN 2 PARTS!** FFS. You buy a game, think you can play it but guess what! It sucks if you didn't also buy the ""accessory"" that they just made for it. Sound familiar?  You are in love with Nintendo for their history, their past quality if you will. Not their actual quality. What, in the past 5 years, has Nintendo produced that consider to be ""quality"" (something that no one else did, or that Nintendo did it better)?  I ♥ YOU!

t5_2qh13,RabidRaccoon,1331545250,"There's no evidence that Afghan informants are being coerced. Quite likely they are doing it because they dislike the Taliban who ruined the country when they run it, or want the cash/US residence that the US can hand out. Or both.  Look at the person who informed on Uday Hussein  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uday_Hussein#Death  &gt; Later, the American command said that dental records had conclusively identified two of the dead men as Saddam Hussein's sons. They also announced that the informant (possibly the owner of the villa in Mosul in which the brothers were killed) would receive the combined $30 million award previously offered for their apprehension.[15] &gt; &gt; Furthermore, the owner of the villa, Nawaf az-Zeidan, who is distantly related to Saddam, was granted U.S. citizenship and permitted to depart from Iraq. Locals said Zeidan had tipped off United States forces that Saddam's sons were staying there. The brothers were said to have become overbearing in their demands and took his hospitality for granted. On 18 June 2004, Zeidan's brother Salaah al-Zeidan was killed, and three of his male relatives (including an eight-year-old boy) traveling in the same vehicle were wounded by unknown assassins.  So he got paid a lot of money and got US citizenship and also got Uday Hussein killed. Unfortunately Uday's buddies killed his brother in retaliation.  Uday Hussein was [not a very nice man](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uday_Hussein#Allegations_of_crimes) and certainly - to use an Assange phrase - had it coming to him.  http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,454453,00.html  &gt; After months of recovering from an attempt on his life that put eight bullets in his left side, Uday Hussein, the eldest son of Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, was ready to party. At his first outing in 1998, at the posh Jadriyah Equestrian Club, he used high-powered binoculars to survey the crowd of friends and family from a platform high above the guests. He saw something he liked, recalls his former aide Adib Shabaan, who helped arrange the party. Uday tightened the focus on a pretty 14-year-old girl in a bright yellow dress sitting with her father, a former provincial governor, her mother and her younger brother and sister.  &gt; &gt; Uday's bodyguards picked up the signal and walked through the darkened room, flicking cigarette lighters as they approached the girl's table. Uday, then 33, flipped on his too, confirming they had identified the right one. When the girl left the table for the powder room, Uday's bodyguards approached her with a choice, says Shabaan, who was Uday's business manager. She could ascend the platform now and congratulate Uday on his recovery, or she could call him on his private phone that night. Flustered, she apologized and said her parents would allow neither. One of the guards replied, ""This is the chance of your life"" and promised she would receive diamonds and a car. ""All you have to do is go up there for 10 minutes,"" he urged. When she demurred again, the bodyguards pursued Uday's backup plan. They maneuvered the girl in the direction of the parking lot, picked her up and carried her to the backseat of Uday's car, covering her mouth to muffle her screams.  &gt; &gt; After three days the girl was returned to her home, with a new dress, a new watch and a large sum of cash. Her parents had her tested for rape; the result was positive. According to Shabaan's account, Uday heard she had been tested and sent aides to the clinic, where they warned doctors not to report a rape. Furious, the father demanded to see Saddam himself. Rebuffed, he kept complaining publicly about what Uday had done. After three months, the President's son had had enough. He sent two guards to the man to insist that he drop the matter. Uday had another demand: that the ex-governor bring his daughter and her 12-year-old sister to his next party. ""Your daughters will be my girlfriends, or I'll wipe you off the face of the earth."" The man complied, surrendering both girls.  In fact his Ace Of Hearts designation in the US most wanted cards is supposed to be an ironic reference to the fact he was an prolific rapist.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Most-wanted_Iraqi_playing_cards#Hearts  &gt; Ace ♥: Uday Saddam Husayn, son of Saddam Hussein, killed in standoff with US Army in Mosul, Iraq 2003 (#3).",♥

t5_2qh16,ZeroCool1,1331575565,"Corrosion of alloys by molten salts is fundamentally different than corrosion caused by high temperature air or water oxidation.10  Many alloys rely on the oxygen in air and in water to create a stable protective film on the surface of the metal (CrO, NiO, Al2O3).  These oxide layers are not stable in fluoride containing salts.  Fluoride salts also attack chromium through grain boundary dissolution through impurity corrosion reactions, intrinsic corrosion, and galvanic corrosion.10   II.A. Impurity Corrosion Reactions  There are three reversible reactions by which impurities in molten salt can chemically corrode an alloy.12  H2O+2F-↔O2-+2HF	 (1)  H2O+F-↔OH-+HF	 (2)  M0+xHF-↔ H2+MFx	 (3) Where M is any metal in the exposed alloy, and x is the oxidation state of the metal M.  In order to produce corrosion, these reactions must all work together. Impurity driven corrosion originates with water.  By introducing water into a molten salt, a disassociated fluoride can react with it producing an oxide or hydroxide and hydrofluoric acid gas, as shown in eqs. 1-2.  This hydrofluoric acid can then fluorinate metals which are exposed to the molten salt and convert them into metal difluorides.  The metal difluorides can then dissolve into the salt, exposing more bare metal.  In order to stop these reactions, all the water, oxides, and hydroxides must be removed from the salt.  II.B. Intrinsic Corrosion  Intrinsic corrosion occurs to the favorable free energy of formation of many transition metal fluorides. Fluorination reactions with more negative free energy of formation indicate that a transition metal is more unstable in fluoride salt.  By examining the Gibbs free energy of formation for metals being converted into metal fluorides  a series can be made which ranks each metal’s nobility.  It has been found that in molten fluoride salts the tendency for common alloying constituents to be attacked increased in the following order: W, Mo, Ni, Co, Fe, Nb, Cr, Mn, Ti, Zr, Al, with Al being the most dissolution prone and nickel being the most noble.10   In a FHR, the temperature could change over several hundred degrees celcius—reaching its peak around the fuel and its minimum in the heat exchanger.  Such a temperature difference causes dramatic metal difluoride solubility gradients within the molten salt.12  Therefore, in hot areas with higher solubility, more metal difluorides are produced and subsequently dissolved into the salt.  As this salt flows to colder areas of the reactor, the solubility of the contaminants decreases and metal difluorides will precipitate and build up.  In the small arteries of a heat exchanger, these deposits could completely block the flow of molten salt.  As the salt moves back to the fuel, the temperature would rise, causing it to absorb metal difluorides.  This cycle can repeat indefinitely; metal difluorides must be removed before they can reach a saturation solubility of the cold leg.  II.C. Galvanic Corrosion  When fluoride salts melt the individual components disassociate.  For example, LiF would turn into Li+ and F-.  These individual components are called a Lewis acid and base.  A Lewis acid is capable of accepting an electron while a Lewis base will give an electron.10  Through this mechanism a molten salt can become electrolytic, causing dissimilar metals with different electromotive potentials (EMP) to experience galvanic corrosion.  A metal with a negative EMP can become anodic while a metal with a positive EMP can become cathodic.  In order to prevent corrosion through galvanic couples, a FHR must be constructed from metals whose positions on the galvanic series are similar. ",↔

I then went through all the ""functions"" sections, combined the uses found in one list and ran `more wd40uses.txt | grep ubrica | uniq | wc -l` — [**737** uses mention using WD40 as a lubricant, here is the list of them](http://pastebin.com/DYQskDbP)!

I am sure there are even more, I just think I've made my point already.  **Let me reiterate this: on the official site, WD-40 is claimed to be a lubricant at least 737 times.

Adobe clearly think it is, and they market it as such.  No, they don't.  They market it as a *page layout* tool that does print and digital (with a recent heavy push for digital magazines, newspapers, and catalogs). Being a *page layout* tool is the important distinction. Framemaker is the *structured* authoring tool of the two.  Here's what Adobe's Framemaker 10 FAQ has to say on the subject:  &gt; Adobe® FrameMaker® 10 is a powerful authoring and publishing tool that is the standard for unstructured, structured, and XML/DITA content.

Swear words also serve as social [shibboleths](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shibboleth).   Previously they were very often indicators of membership of certain social strata. (Somewhat relevant: [1]) NB: That doesn't mean that members of ""higher"" or ""upper"" classes never swore – speakers might have had additional [registers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Register_%28sociolinguistics%29) which they used depending on context. Nowadays curse words are still social shibboleths, but their role as class indicators is much diminished – probably their main shibboleth application in the US is that people and media companies who [bowdlerise](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowdlerise) ""bad words"" thereby identify themselves as ""God-fearing Christians"", which brings me to my final point:  3. Magical thinking. Some (at least ostensibly) religious people appear to believe (or exhibit the belief) that those ""bad words"" are inherently evil, that is to say, that they are infectious agents of something that is of the devil, and therefore they believe that it was everybody else's and the public media's responsibility to refrain from using these words, lest they or more people become infected, as –according to their magical thinking– using these ""bad words"" spreads and increases *Evil®* in the world.  ----  Re.

DOTA 2 Minimum Requirements:  * Operating System: Windows® 7 / Vista / Vista64 / XP / Mac  * Processor: Pentium 4 3.0GHz or AMD Athlon equivalent  * Memory: 1 GB for XP / 2GB for Vista  * Graphics: DirectX 9 compatible video card with 128 MB, Shader model 2.0. ATI X800, NVidia 7800 or better  * Hard Drive: 3.0 GB of free space  * Sound: DirectX 9.0c compatible sound card  You need to buy a new video card as the 6150SE is an integrated graphics card is only good enough to run games at roughly playstation 1 level graphics.  I played with a 9600 GT and got roughly 25-30 fps with this video card. I would recommend an HD 6850 @ $140 if you want full 60 fps.  Make sure your motherboard/case has enough room for a large video card. I checked your [motherboard](http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?lc=en&amp;dlc=en&amp;cc=us&amp;docname=c00906137) and if this is true then it should be no problem.   Your CPU is not too old. My old machine was a Core2Duo E4500 @ 3.0 ghz which is roughly half as good as the CPU you have right now and I was able to run DOTA2 decently with a few hiccups. In fact, you probably did not know that your computer would actually run games like Skyrim and Deus Ex HR on high/ultra settings if you had a good graphics card. I know because I've done these myself on a much weaker processor.  Upgrade to a bigger PSU to accommodate a new video card. A 500Watt PSU would only cost roughly $40.  Good luck and have fun!",®

t5_2qqjc,CrackCC_Lurking,1331716534,"Most people (especially in America) that are in the spotlight, hold a important/public position, call themselves **agnostic** &amp; not atheist. The backlash from the religious fanatics is too heavy to claim you ""believe there is no god"". By using the term ""agnostic"", they can just say ""I don't know if there is a god or not"".  It's kind meaningless to be agnostic because each sides contradicts the other. Part of either ""belief"" is totally incompatible with the other.  *You can't be for &amp; against something* Being religious is to believe in god. Being an atheist is believing there is no god. If you are agnostic &amp; believe there could be a god, then you are ultimately acknowledging his his existence.  Sorry I went off track here.  Famous people (mostly in America) will never admit to being atheists &amp; will most likely say they are agnostic *(unless they are a ""provocative"" personality, like an atheist version of a religious fanatic).* They say this just to get the religious fanatics off their back, keep their jobs, friends, customers, fans, keep getting invited to tv shows, preserve their children/wife/house from attacks, etc etc... They can always repy to a hostile religious attack by ""going neutral"" &amp; claiming they just don't know.   This tactic is used by everyone in common situations e.g: You are walking home when you get accosted by a dozen drunken rednecks. One of them says to you: ""Fuck those niggers! They're not real people, they're like animals?"". Now you don't believe this is true, but if you say what truly believe &amp; how you think they are just as human as the rednecks, you know they turn hostile &amp; from that point on, only bad things will happen. So you take the ""agnostic"" approach &amp; say ""I don't know"". Thus diffusing the situation &amp; still (more or less) sticking to your principles. Their claim is as ludicrous as religion. It's as ""un-provable"" as religion, in a sense that they will just ignore &amp; claim it to be false, or you'll need to prove your ""proof"". It's a pussy way out (imo), but people that are exposed to the general public like that have to be neutral like that. It's just being ""safe"". That's what politicians, celebrities (mostly the new ones, the older ones &amp; the ones that have proven themselves can be more honest), athletes, &amp; C.E.Os all adopt the same ""neutral"" stance. Not just on religion but on just about everything that people could care strongly about.  If you took the time to read this I ♥ you! Sorry for making it so long &amp; repetitive.",♥

Also, do NOT fill the drymistat tube with PG. They are designed to work directly with tap water.

If so and it was 75% in the salt test, then the 60% currently could be from the humidor getting acclimated/seasoned.

(NASDAQ: HAS) and Atari, S.A. announced today the settlement and resolution of the complaint against Atari, S.A. and the counterclaims filed by Atari, S.A. against Hasbro, Inc. filed in December 2009 in regards to the Dungeons &amp; Dragons brand. &gt;Digital licensing rights for Dungeons &amp; Dragons have been returned to Hasbro. Atari will continue to develop and market several games under license from Hasbro and Wizards, including the #1 Xbox LIVE® hit Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Daggerdale and the upcoming Heroes of Neverwinter for Facebook. Additional settlement details remain private. In addition, the acquisition of Cryptic Studios by Perfect World Entertainment Inc. from Atari in July 2011 has delayed the Neverwinter PC Game scheduled for release later this year. Perfect World will be investing in a more immersive experience for release in late 2012.   Basically, there was a suit, WotC (Hasbro) got the license back, but Atari is still developing games.

What you are saying ends all of *your* questions about consciousness. The rest of the human race does not agree with your personal views. You are one voice among billions of voices and you do not stand strong. You are incorrect, and happy in your ignorance. Nothing is complicated about what you are saying.

Then I spring into action. Creep up to the door, I'm about four feet from the roach at this point. I very timidly inch closer, telling my brother that I can't do this. ""Just get the fucking roach spray"" he says.   This bugger is a big 'un. Maybe an entire inch and a half in length. Brown. Dark brown. The color of shit.   I grab my can of  Raid® Ant &amp; Roach Killer. Its residual action kills ants and roaches for up to four weeks.  ""OH NO!"" says I.  The top of the Raid® Ant &amp; Roach Killer was loose. It wouldn't stay on. I knew I had to try.   Just then, I heard a ""Hurry up. Spray that roach, I gotta go to bed soon"" from the other room. At this point I was trembling like a mother fucker. Arms shaking, could barely move forward. Basically in a matter of 20 minutes or so, I've gone from tired and weary traveler, to Gandalf at a solid [6] fighting the Balrog at the Birdge of Khazad-dûm. This shit was intense.   ***""YOU SHALL NOT PASS!!!""*** I screamed at the top of my lungs. Although my brother insists it sounded like ""aroacharoachOMGgetitaway.""  I sprayed that roach for five whole seconds before it scurried off. I followed it. While I was hesitant to keep spraying this toxic poison into my brother's room right next to where he sleeps, he signaled for the roach to be put out of it's misery. I sprayed at it for another 20 seconds, going all around the room. By the time my can sputtered, and finally cut off, my foe was dead.   After being coaxed, and berated for well over 2 minutes, I finally started to carefully shuffle my way over to the bathroom to get some TP. I unwound about a quarter of the roll, and stared at my fallen opponent. I was too petrified to move.   ""You gotta face your fear""   ""I can't""  ""Do it! You have eight seconds""  ""8...""  ""7...""  ""6...""  ""5...""  ""4...""  ""3...""  ""2...""  ""1...""  I still couldn't do it. After some time had passed, I started creeping my way over. Soon this rescue chopper that was the wad of TP was hovering directly over the wounded combatant. The chopper landed, and clamped down on the load.   ""You gotta talk me through this"" was said by me.   ""Pick it up, put it in the toilet, and flush.""  And you know what? I did, and it *did* work.   tl;dr Peace was restored to the Shire ",®

t5_2qhk3,C0CKPUNCHER,1331842595,"Copied here so yu don't have to give them traffic  ""Archy offers an insider’s perspective on how an anxiety disorder can overtake a man’s life.  What is life like with social anxiety disorder? Imagine being 6’6, 300lbs, appear to be quite intimidating and most likely able to handle most one on one fights with ease… but still being afraid of certain people, certain experiences, even being very nervous around women who are ½ your size! This is just a taste of my experience in life and hope it helps illustrate mental illness for others:  I grew up being bullied on a daily basis at school because I was bigger than everyone else. I enjoyed running around and being a typical outdoors kid, loved soccer/football (FIFA not NRL/NFL/etc) yet I gained weight and kids loved to tease me about it.  Being quite an emotionally sensitive kid, I could hear the disgust, the dislike, the “eww you’re gross” in just the tone of voice, so when that tone came along with the very negative words, it had quite a lot of impact on my young mind.  Being overweight made me slower on the field, and because of that, I copped quite a lot of verbal abuse from my teammates. It got to the point where soccer was no longer fun, and this was probably the start of my anxiety around other people. I didn’t want to change to another team, as I feared it would happen there too.  My fear of others was especially true of the popular “jock” or sporty type who seemed to be so cool, and for them to hate me was quite crushing to my self-esteem. At age 10 I was already quite shy, and I didn’t feel safe at all away from family. I got homesick quite a bit on sleepovers and even had to go home from a school camp.  One day at primary school, I did something wrong, and one of my teachers physically assaulted me, whilst screaming at the top of his lungs. This left the entire classroom of kids crying, and from that moment on I had a lot of fear hearing any adult male yell. Because of that experience, as well as two other teachers assaulting me, my trust with adults in authority was broken heavily.  In high school the bullying continued daily, I’d get teased for answering questions and being too smart, and teased over my weight. I was also starting to get the “nipple cripple’s”, being tripped (which led to a broken wrist) and the intensity of the verbal abuse increased. In turn, my weight had climbed up as I was comfort eating more, avoiding sports because of fear of the other people in the teams and all of this was leading me to become more anxious.  In high school my graduating class had quite a lot of mean girls, more so than normal in other classes. I received quite a lot of teasing from them. Some even asked me out as a joke, or used me AS a joke: the girls would tease the other girls that I was their boyfriend, as the idea of that was so offensive to them.  By my senior year of high school I was probably obese, I had a suicidal depression, was self-mutilating to feel a pain that wasn’t emotional as an escape, and skipping school to avoid the bullying and abuse. I escaped into computer games, staying up quite late just to feel any sense of happiness. This sent me from straight A’s to C’s, D’s and total F’s, and eventually I completely shut down and gave up on schoolwork nearly altogether.  I listened to music to try tune out the world and all of the pain. I never had a girlfriend in school, and I was rejected whenever I asked out a girl. This was all summed up when I was one of the very few people at the prom without a date…even though there were more females than males and a few females actually went together.  ♦◊♦  After high school, I moved away for college and was living on my own away from friends and family, leaving me quite isolated. My health suffered so badly that I had to move back to the family home as I was unable to focus nor had the energy for college. My father died soon after moving back home, leaving me feeling extremely lonely. That was when my depression hit the big time. I pretty much locked myself away in my room at home for a few years, only seeing a few people occasionally and my remaining family at night.  One night I tried going out to the clubs. Some guy asked me for a drink, and when I refused he decided to punch me a few times in the stomach. He only stopped when I tensed my stomach. He left me alone and started throwing chairs and stormed out. I was totally paralyzed in fear, yet my body has enough strength that I could have put him in hospital.  All of these events basically caused my unconscious mind to treat humans as a threat. My fight-or-flight responses being triggered quite easily causes me to avoid a lot of social situations. I would feel hesitation and find any excuse to not go to the shops if I had to, and avoided going to parties and seeing people I didn’t know very well.  At this point, my work life is nearly non-existent, I had a few months’ work but depression really took its toll on me and I had a large breakdown. The fear of talking to new people, let alone women, has made it very hard to make new friends and I haven’t asked anyone out in many years. The few female friends I’ve had, I’ve been the typical “nice guy” to, too afraid to show my intentions, so they’ve led to very little romantic interest.  ♦◊♦  Social anxiety is basically living with an intense fear of social situations, chronic fear of being judged, and feeling embarrassed or humiliated by your actions. It can cripple your life, can withdraw you from society itself and it’s been strangling me for too long. The loneliness I’ve felt is extreme and has actually worsened my depression. I am someone that actually loves being around people I feel safe with.  Sadly, the automatic fear I have has truly limited my ability to socialize or even be employed: the fear that something bad will happen, the fear that someone will abuse me, fear I won’t measure up to expectations, even the fear of the fear itself!  I’ve made a lot of progress though over the years, I’ve finally killed the depression and the social anxiety is lowering a lot. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy plus Acceptance and Commitment Therapy has helped tremendously in removing the negative thoughts. Slowly getting out into the world, taking courses to learn new skills and meeting people with a trusted friend or family member is exposing and reprogramming my mind to see that not all humans are going to hurt me. It’s a slow progress but it’s making me stronger every day.""",♦

If he were say 5-6 years younger then it'd be easy, younger brothers look up to their older brothers whether they like it or not, AND whether you know it or not so just let him know you watch it and like it and he'd change his mind quickly. Your younger brother is NOT going to think negative of you no matter what, it's brother code. If he does, he's a shitty brother.  Okay, back to assuming a maximum of 2-3 year age gap, IF the conversation ever comes up (don't force it) and he spouts off about how it's weird just say, ""I'm gonna go watch it for myself, I'll report back."" Wait a day. ""Hey, this show isn't as bad as you thought, give it a try, it's pretty funny.""  BAM, DONE. Don't push it any further!  At this point:  He knows you like the show. This does one very important thing, any negative thoughts about bronies will immediately come back to thoughts of you since the mental association is there. If he cares enough about you (and he fucking better) then his opinion about you and your associations will change.  Note: This basically applies to anything.  example: I like dubstep, my roommates (very good friends) don't and they sometimes crack a joke about it (messaging me with ""HEY! HOW DEM WUBS GOIN!??!?!"" if I have my music a little loud). The important thing is that they won't think too negatively about people that listen to dubstep because they know they have a friend that listens to it. They also aren't bronies (they haven't watched any of the show either) but they know I like it and typically don't give me a hard time about it.  TL;DR: PSYCHOLOGY BITCHES! IT WORKS!  Note: I assume you guys grew up together and he likes you. If he barely knows you then the psychology thing kinda goes out the window.",♥

Something that needs to be taken up with your city.  I find most bicyclists dont actually know the laws.    It basically comes down to this basic principle:  Bicyclists have the same rules as motorists WITH CLEAR EXCEPTIONS.  They actually have more laws and standards than either motorists and pedestrians - for good reason.  There is also one MAJOR misconception = Bicyclists do NOT have the right of way.  Personally I find the problem is more mis-education and arrogance.  Of course this isnt every cyclist, but certainly enough to create a stereotype.

The scene floor opens and up comes Hatsune Miku, with her long, green pigtails, big eyes and black stockings. The public cheers for her, but she can’t hear them.   That’s how it goes when the 16 years old popstar have her first concert outside her home country, Japan. The show was set up for Anime Expo, North-Americas biggest event for cartoon fans (The author probably meant anime…).  The public is watching the pop phenomenon Hatsune Miku, a 3D hologram, a lot like a digital avatar. She doesn’t have a soul or a personality, but an amazing voice and an appealing look. That way, it looks like she is standing on the stage together with the band.  It’s the Japanese technology company Crypton Future Media that have created Miku. The company uses voice recordings from actors and runs it through a software called Vocaloid produced by Yamaha. Out comes Hatsune Miku’s voice, a fusion of human and electronic sound.   Using animated pop starts isn’t entirely new. In 1998 was the band Gorillaz created by Damon Albarn. The four animated band members were drawn by the British, and their first album sold 7 million records.  In 2006 ended the designer Alexander McQueen one of his shows something he called “a piece of technological magic”. A rotating white cloud transforms into a hologram of Kate Moss in a waving white dress.    The Japanese idol Hatsune Miku was created after Gorillaz. Miku was created in 2007, she was supposed to be an advertisement for Vocaloid.  “The thought was that we could create a new instrument, as long as we had a cool or cute manga character to sell Vocaloid. So we focused on actors, not singers with the best voice, because we knew the program would handle the voice.” explains Hioryuki Ito, the president of Crypton Future Media in a youtube interview. Vocaloid, the program that can be used to create any song on your computer, became a success. “How is the sales going? It is going really good. We estimated that 10% of the customers would be young girls, but it turned out to end up at 45%, it looks like they really like Miku” said Kazumitsu Shimizu from Sony Music in 2009. She have half a million fans on facebook by 2012. All the 10000 tickets were quickly sold at a concert in Tokyo, the concert was also streamed live to 24 cinemas all over Japan. On Norwegian teen blogs Hatsune Miku is commonly talked about by Justin Bieber and Hello Kitty fans (I can’t really say I agree with that statement).  (Didn't have time to translate the rest of the article, you're not missing out on a lot. Might update it later today)",✌

t5_2qstm,coopdude,1332002116,"Doesn't the card have a grace period? Check your statements.  &gt;The grace period listed for the Best Buy® Credit Card is at least 25 days*. So interest charges will not be applied for purchases during those days. Be aware that some issuers will begin charging interest on cash advances and balance transfers on the transaction date.   So if you charge $100 in purchases from Jan 1 - Jan 30th, and they mail your statement on Jan 30th, you would have had until Friday Feb 24th to pay your statement and not incur interest (assuming you pay in full).  I put away cards I don't want to use. Some people take a sock without a match and shove the cards they don't want to use right now in it. Also effective (for store discount/loyalty cards/gift cards/credit cards you aren't using) is a cheap faux leather business card booklet. It holds a ton of cards (both business &amp; credit, same size) and you can pick them up for ~$7 at Staples.  That's a personal choice on cancellation. If it's one of your oldest cards and it would greatly reduce the average age of your accounts, I say sock drawer it. If it's not that big of an impact... you can cancel, but you could just sockdrawer it too. If there's a real temptation to spend, cancel it though.",®

At best, you'd get an argument for why any extraterrestrial life is non-sentient -- you know, because it would screw up the vicarious redemption story, or require a new 'interpretation' of the bible to come to grips with salvation for E.T.

t5_2qpp6,Barrin,1332027674,"Hey guys :D I am the author. TL;DR is as follows:  ""There is a certain.. spectrum of breadth of gameplay, and every RTS game has it's tendencies on this spectrum. By breadth I mean: how often should you be expanding? At what point do you no longer need to expand because you have all the resources you want or need to maintain a supply cap?  When it is more desirable to expand more rapidly and continue expanding longer, there is more opportunity for smaller engagements to occur over a larger area of the map more often. Expanding makes you more vulnerable, and vulnerability means action. However, if you were to do the opposite and concentrate more of the focus into a smaller area (by say, putting more resources in each base) you start leaning towards the ""Deathball"" [read: simple] side of the breadth spectrum.  Due to a relatively high maximum resource collection rate per mineral field and therefore base (among other things), SC2 is mathematically predisposed to the ""Deathball"" side of the spectrum as opposed to ""smaller, more frequent, more spread out"" engagements. Even though (like any good RTS game) SC2 is incredibly complex, this predisposition results in a relative lack of complexity, lack of map variety, lowered skill ceiling, improper risk vs. reward when microing individual units resulting in more emphasis on macro compared to micro - which in combination with other factors is self-perpetuating. Reversing this by reducing the maximum resource collection rate per base also positively enhances a host of other elements.""  Remember, we CAN do this without blizzard!

t5_2cneq,mvlazysusan,1332043370,"Audio of the event: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrRMiePxZBU  I shall first start off this report by saying that Bryan Spencer, the Saint Charles County Repulican Party Central Committe man who was tasked to organize the caucus told my fellow Ron Paul Coordinator here in Saint Charles at the last Saint Charles County Central Committe meeting, that 'if the Ron Paul people come in and hijack the caucus, I will do everything in my power to throw out the entire delegation on a technicallity.'  This is exactly what happened, but first, let me clarify what Spencer means by 'hijack'. There are no rules going into the caucus, aside from Robert's Rules of Order. At the caucus, the temporary chairman opens the meeting with the Pledge of Allegiance and a prayer. Next, the temporary chairman opens the floor for nominations for a permanent chair in which the entire body of voters votes for. The newly elected chairman opens the floor to nominate a secretary. Then the chairman appoints a parlamentarian, the rules committe, and the credentials committee. The rules are voted on and then the body selects delegates to go to the Congressional District Convention and the State Convention.  So, the key is to organize your suppporters into 'slates', which are lists of names of the supporters who wish to be delegates. Ideally, you want to have your slates full, this way, all delegates that go to the conventions will be your candidate's delgates. It is the process of a democratic republic. Organization is the key going into the caucus, and we had came prepared with the only complete slate of delegates. The Romney camp and Santorum camp had incomplete slates. We could have potentially have walked away with all of the 147 of the delegates.  So this is what Spencer means by 'hijack'. There is no rule against having your stuff together and taking all of the delegates. It is the name of the game. We knew the GOP rules going in, and intended to follow them. We know that Spencer was encouraging the Santorum Coordinator to take all of the delegates if she had the numbers, so, it seems that he is okay with his guy getting the delegates, but not ours.  So, when we checked into the caucus, we were asked to vote in a straw poll for the candidate of our choice. Bryan Spencer's claimed intent on this was to proportion the delegates by the votes from the straw poll, but I believe different. I believe that the GOP had a plan in case the Ron Paul supporters showed up with good numbers, and throwing out the delegation was it.  When it comes to a caucus, the body chooses the rules, not the GOP central committee. Before the temporary chairman (Eugene Dokes) opened the meeting, a set of rules was not proposed, but was made binding. One of the rules included was the ban on recording devices. I believe this 'rule' was put in for the reason of raising a ruckus. When that rule was read, it was very clear that everyone, not just Paul supporters, in that room opposed the rule. Boos ensued as well as Bryce Steinhoff, myself, Brent Stafford, and countless others tried making motions to overturn that rule and to put it up for a vote. Eugene ignored the motions, shouts of 'point of order', etc.  After around 20 minutes of deadlock and an eventual submission of the camera owner to turn it off, he opened the meeting by appointing a parlimentarian, appointing the credentials committee, and the rules committee, which are all appointments made by the PERMANENT chair whose has been elected by the body, not the temporary chair. He completly went around Robert's Rules of Order. This is why the GOP did not want the process recorded. Again, they completly ignored parlimentary rule to usher in their chairman.  Next, Dokes opened the floor for nominations for the permanent chair, in complete opposite order than Robert's Rule of Order states. At this time, the whole gynasium errupted in the call for Brent Stafford to be nominated, which Dokes ignored. Dokes then made his own nomination for chair and then called for a voice vote. The entire gymnasium erupted again with the call for 'division', which is the term that calls for a standing or ballot vote, which was utimately ignored by Dokes. Dokes's voice vote result was that the ""I's'' have it, which was clearly not the case. Dokes then motioned to close nominations, called for a voice vote, and nominations were closed without any recognition of motions from the floor. Then the new 'permanent chair' made a motion to adjourn the meeting, swung his gavel, and it was over.  No delegates were awarded.  Next, we tried to amass the people outside in the parking lot to have our own stump caucus to pick the delegates for the conventions. But the Saint Peters Police came over and arrested Brent Stafford for ''tresspassing"", as well as Kenny Suitter, the man with the camera.  I go back to what Bryan Spencer said to Bryce at the Central Committee meeting: 'If the Ron Paul people try to 'hijack' the caucus, I will do everthing in my power to throw out the entire delegation.  'Did Ron Paul have a majority in the room according to the straw poll at the door? Did the vote counters see this and feared the Ron Paul campaign would be able to elect their chair and walk away with all of the delegates? Did the sight of the Ron Paul Coordinators and the Romney Coordinators brokering a deal worry them that Santorum would not get any delegates?  I know for sure a few people on the Saint Charles GOP Cnetral Committee are Santorum supporters.  The news media is focusing on the guy with the camera who was arrested, but I can assure you that there was more behind this caucus than is being reported.  This is plain corruption.

Lieutenant Colonel John Malcolm Thorpe Fleming ""Jack"" Churchill, DSO &amp; Bar, MC &amp; Bar (16 September 1906 – 8 March 1996), nicknamed ""Fighting Jack Churchill"" and ""Mad Jack"", was a British soldier who fought throughout World War II armed with a longbow, arrows and a Scottish broadsword. He once said ""any officer who goes into action without his sword is improperly armed."" Contents  [hide]  1 Early life 2 Second World War 3 Later life 4 Family 5 Notes 6 References [edit]Early life  Born in Hong Kong to English parents and educated at King William's College on the Isle of Man, Churchill graduated from Sandhurst in 1926 and served in Burma with the Manchester Regiment. He left the army in 1936 and worked as a newspaper editor. He used his archery and bagpipe talents to play a small role in the film The Thief of Bagdad. [edit]Second World War  Churchill resumed his commission after Poland was invaded. In May 1940, Churchill and his unit, the Manchester Regiment, ambushed a German patrol near L'Epinette, France. Churchill gave the signal to attack by cutting down the enemy Feldwebel (sergeant) with his barbed arrows, becoming the only known British soldier to have felled an enemy with a longbow in the course of the war.[1] After fighting at Dunkirk, he volunteered for the Commandos, unsure of what Commando duty entailed, but was interested because it sounded dangerous. Churchill was second in command of No. 3 Commando in Operation Archery, a raid on the German garrison at Vågsøy, Norway on December 27, 1941.[2] As the ramps fell on the first landing craft, Churchill leapt forward from his position and played a tune on his bagpipes, before throwing a grenade and running into battle in the bay. For his actions at Dunkirk and Vågsøy, Churchill received the Military Cross and Bar. Perhaps Churchill's most impressive military exploits came in early 1942. It is claimed that he and five other Commandos took down a whole German outpost of around 300 men. The mission took them three weeks, in which time they hid in the dense undergrowth surrounding the outpost, surviving on a diet of Marmite and salami. In July 1943, as commanding officer, he led 2 Commando from their landing site at Catania in Sicily with his trademark Scottish broadsword slung around his waist and a longbow and arrows around his neck and his bagpipes under his arm.[3] This was again repeated at the landings at Salerno. Leading 2 Commando, Churchill was ordered to capture a German observation post outside of the town of La Molina controlling a pass leading down to the Salerno beach-head. He led the attack by 2 and 41 Commandos, infiltrating the town and capturing the post, taking 42 prisoners including a mortar squad. Churchill led the men and prisoners back down the pass with the wounded being carried on carts, pushed by German prisoners. He commented that to him it was ""an image from the Napoleonic Wars.""[4] He received the Distinguished Service Order for leading this action at Salerno.[5] In 1944, he led the Commandos in Yugoslavia, where they supported the efforts of Josip Broz Tito's Partisans from the Adriatic island of Vis.[6] In May, he was ordered to raid the German held island of Brač. He organised a motley army of 1,500 Partisans, 43 Commando and one troop from 40 Commando for the raid. The landing was unopposed, but on seeing the eyries from which they later encountered German fire, the Partisans decided to defer the attack until the following day. Churchill's bagpipes signalled the remaining Commandos to battle. After being strafed by an RAF Spitfire, Churchill decided to withdraw for the night and to re-launch the attack the following morning.[7] The following morning, one flanking attack was launched by 43 Commando with Churchill leading the elements from 40 Commando. The Partisans remained at the landing area. Only Churchill and six others managed to reach the objective. A mortar shell killed or wounded everyone but Churchill, who was playing ""Will Ye No Come Back Again?"" on his pipes as the Germans advanced. He was knocked unconscious by grenades and captured.[7] He was later flown to Berlin for interrogation and then transferred to Sachsenhausen concentration camp.[citation needed]   Jack Churchill (far right) leads a training exercise, sword in hand, from a Eureka boat in Inveraray. In September 1944, he and a Royal Air Force officer crawled under the wire through an abandoned drain and attempted to walk to the Baltic coast. They were recaptured near the coastal city of Rostock, a few kilometres from the sea. In late April 1945 Churchill and about 140 other prominent concentration camp inmates were transferred to Tyrol, guarded by SS troops. A delegation of prisoners told senior Germany army officers they feared they would be executed. An army unit commanded by Captain Wichard von Alvensleben moved in to protect the prisoners. Outnumbered, the SS guards moved out, leaving the prisoners behind.[8] The prisoners were then set free. After the departure of the Germans Churchill walked 150 kilometres (93 mi) to Verona, Italy where he met an American armoured force.[citation needed] As the Pacific War was still ongoing Churchill was sent to Burma,[9] where the largest land battles against Japan were still raging, but by the time he reached India, Hiroshima and Nagasaki had been bombed, and the war abruptly ended. Churchill was said to be unhappy with the sudden end of the war, saying: ""If it wasn't for those damn Yanks, we could have kept the war going another 10 years.""[9] [edit]Later life  In 1946 Twentieth Century Fox was making Ivanhoe with Churchill’s old rowing companion Robert Taylor. The studio hired Churchill to appear as an archer, shooting from the walls of Warwick Castle. After World War II ended, Churchill qualified as a parachutist, transferred to the Seaforth Highlanders, and later ended up in Palestine as second-in-command of 1st Battalion, the Highland Light Infantry. In the spring of 1948, just before the end of the British mandate in the region, Churchill became involved in another conflict. Along with twelve of his soldiers, he attempted to assist the Hadassah medical convoy that came under attack by hundreds of Arabs.[10] Following the massacre, he coordinated the evacuation of 700 Jewish doctors, students and patients from the Hadassah hospital on the Hebrew University campus on Mount Scopus in Jerusalem. In later years, Churchill served as an instructor at the land-air warfare school in Australia, where he became a passionate devotee of the surfboard. Back in England, he was the first man to ride the River Severn’s five-foot tidal bore and designed his own board. In retirement, however, his eccentricity continued. He startled train conductors and passengers by throwing his attaché case out of the train window each day on the ride home. He later explained that he was tossing his case into his own back garden so he wouldn’t have to carry it from the station.[10] He finally retired from the army in 1959, with two awards of the Distinguished Service Order, and died at home in Surrey in 1996. [edit]Family  Churchill married Rosamund Margaret Denny on March 8, 1941 [11] with whom he fathered two children. Malcolm John Leslie Churchill, born November 11, 1942 and Rodney Alistair Gladstone Churchill, born July 4, 1947. He was of no known relation to Winston Churchill. [edit]Notes  ^ Young, Peter (1969).

t5_2qh5b,Zombiescout,1332188961,"&gt;I don't think it is a question because empirically it makes no difference and as I pointed out leads to an infinite regress. If atoms quack like a duck, they are a duck. If you have no better way to classify it other than to point out all classifications are slippery, my reply is ""well duh.""  You have yet to illustrate this infinite regress. Nor does it make sense to even talk of in this discussion, the point is that simple material constitution is not identity. That the constituting material can be further divided is not important. Not sure where I said classifications are slippery, some are but identity has pretty clear criteria.    &gt;Atoms would be such an idea that was ""left behind"""" then ""brought back"" because empirical reality had a model and mechanism that supporting their existence.  The name yes, otherwise no. The atoms of the atomists are not the same as those today, not even close to being the same idea.  &gt;&gt;I define the standards where what I'm talking about involves a specific definition. You are stepping into the domain of the spiritual and labelling it, which in many spiritual disciplines is the first mistake you can make. If you want to talk about spirituality, you will have to get used to some different ways of looking at life--at least the way I'm talking about it.  I am using the way theologians and philosophers of religion discuss these matters.   &gt;Philosophy is about ideas. The philosophy of science is also about ideas. I can entertain an idea without accepting it. “It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it."" --Aristotle  Entertain is not the same as use to support a position. You are making an argument that relies on a position that you don't accept.   &gt;Assume that I as a person am entirely quantified at the age of 15. Now assume I am quantified at the age of 40. It is clear that these two quantites are not going to numerically match and to use mathematics in such an instance would be foolish. Are you then going to insist that I am not, actually, me?  Yeah that is not what numerical identity is at all. See [this](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/identity/) and [this](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/identity-time/) first. Then you should see that mathematics is not at all relevant here and that you at 15 is still you at 40. The interesting thing is what the criteria for identity over time are since you may no longer have any of the same material composition at 40 that you did at 15.   &gt;Or the other possibility is that it is not an either/or scenario and you are asserting a fallacy as I mentioned from the beginning.  Numerical identity is stronger than qualitative... How could it be either or, if something is numerically identical it has all the same properties ∀F(Fx ↔ Fy) → x=y.   &gt;If we want to map humans isomorphically to matter, then at the scale all matter is one, all humans are also one.  All matter is one in that it is a single set of many individuals. Now the universe or if you prefer multiverse can be said to be one without the subdivision. Or there could be some substrata that is even more fundamental.   &gt;If you do that, I'm going to require you to give an argument as to why--and why all isomorphisms should not be similarly rejected.  I don't think isomorphisms are at all useful or even really applicable here. What we are concerned with is not merely structure, which is already captured in identity but everything else as well. Also isomorphism implies two distinct thing one onto the other. However each particular human is their matter, but in a certain arrangement and time-slice. So while still being just their matter, if you take them and liquefy them, they will cease to exist while that clump of matter will not.    &gt; In application, we map things to other things all the time, and they work fine.  That's great, we are talking about ontology though. If I use a plastic plant for the same aesthetic aim that I would normally use a real plant they are still not anywhere near the same thing though for my purposes from that one perspective they fill the same role.",↔

t5_2qh5b,jbschirtzinger,1332194010,"""You have yet to illustrate this infinite regress.""  If one can reduce their scale forever and find different things, then the regress is infinite.  ""That the constituting material can be further divided is not important.""  Sure it is. If what you are saying basically does nothing to accord with how things appear to work in practice, and in fact leads to something like an infinite regress, then it isn't a very useful criticism, and certainly no grounds to reject something like identity. That we don't know what it is precisely doesn't mean it isn't those things--and that things can be divided indefinitely doesn't mean that it isn't those things or at the very least isomorphically those things. Furthermore, you neglect structure in the discussion, which is a critical element that I've pointed out where identity is concerned.  ""The atoms of the atomists are not the same as those today, not even close to being the same idea.""  That everything is made of atoms as a fundamental constituent of matter sounds ""pretty close"" to me.   ""I am using the way theologians and philosophers of religion discuss these matters. ""  So much the worse for you since you are discussing it with me.   ""Entertain is not the same as use to support a position. You are making an argument that relies on a position that you don't accept.""  Who said anything about supporting a position? I'm considering a perspective. You'll remember that is what I said from the very beginning of this thread.  ""Yeah that is not what numerical identity is at all. See this and this first. Then you should see that mathematics is not at all relevant here and that you at 15 is still you at 40.""  I agree with you, nor do I think it is relevant in the way you are using it where monism of the universe is concerned.   ""Numerical identity is stronger than qualitative... How could it be either or, if something is numerically identical it has all the same properties ∀F(Fx ↔ Fy) → x=y. ""  It is stronger than qualitative when qualitative isn't what should be used. You are trying to use mathematical reasoning where it has no business being used.   ""I don't think isomorphisms are at all useful or even really applicable here.""  Then I assume you are comfortable rejecting large branches of mathematics.  ""What we are concerned with is not merely structure, which is already captured in identity but everything else as well.""  At a universal level, structure is everything else. This is like saying that what we are concerned with with language is not the structure of it, but individual letters. It's a pointless objection.   ""However each particular human is their matter""  No. They are a particular structure of matter.   ""So while still being just their matter, if you take them and liquefy them, they will cease to exist while that clump of matter will not.""  But that structure of matter will not. Hence, the isomorphism fits.  ""If I use a plastic plant for the same aesthetic aim that I would normally use a real plant they are still not anywhere near the same thing though for my purposes from that one perspective they fill the same role.""  A plastic plant would, by definition, not have the same properties as an actual plant, so it wouldn't be used to make an isomorphism. Contrast this with the structure of matter to a human being, and I think the difference is clear. ",↔

t5_2qh03,Malarki,1332198567,"If they ever make a WW2 AC i hope they make it from a Neutral German perspective where you have to fight all three Nations at once.  Stauffenberg and his group of assassins would be perfect for this scenario. The Reich holding the apple of eden while Russians and Americans trying to overwhelm Germany to get it into their hands first. Even tho' the ""Stauffenberg Attentat"" failed it was a distraction to steal the apple of Eden. Thats how the game would end and in an expansion you would try to smuggle it out after the Russian occuption and get it past the Berlin Wall.  All that would be possible without any propaganda bullshit and would be a really great way to get the story going. Afterwards including Pearl harbor and Hiroshima into it.   Anyway, i have no problem with the direction AC3 is going atm. Actually its a fresh setting and i can't wait to play it. It's not even out yet, maybe AC3 will make the American History darker then some people think right now and it will be the opposite of ""american propaganda"" but instead a intelligent, dark and tricky fantasy story, just like it was until now.   Some people seem to forget that AC isn't and never was trying to be historicaly authentic. It wasn't until now and i don't doubt that ac3 will change that.  so far, much love ♥",♥

t5_2r4jn,petercent,1332253170,"Jeep® is the oldest off-road/sport utility vehicle brand. In 1940 the US Army put out specifications to the automobile industry for a vehicle they wanted for the future. The Army knew that they needed a vehicle that could withstand many different terrains and conditions. The first prototype delivered to the Army was from the American Bantam Car Company which had just brought Karl Probst on board for the project. Two other prototypes were produced by Ford and Willys-Overland. The Army felt that the American Bantam Car Company was too small to supply the number of vehicles needed and it then allowed Ford and Willys-Overland to make attempts on their designs after seeing Bantam's vehicle in working order. Willys-Overland offered the lowest bid and won the initial contract. Willys-Overland now had what would become the standardized jeep design. In early 1941 the company showed the off-road performance by driving it up the steps to the US Capital Building in Washington, DC. They started work building the new MB military vehicles at their plant in Toledo, Ohio. ",®

As early as 1959, treatment with DMAE was demonstrated to result in significantly improved test scores.5 A 1974 report on DMAE focused on two 10-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials involving 124 children with ADHD-related diagnoses. In one of these trials, positive results using DMAE were comparable to those using Ritalin®.

If she says ""no,"" he doesn't hang around her like a lost puppy and hope she'll change her mind. Instead, he congratulates himself for trying and moves on to the next girl. He doesn't have too much emotion wrapped up in getting a ""yes."" A ""no"" is a little disappointing, but it's not a soul-crushing rejection.   And when a Potential Boyfriend® gets a DATE, he kisses her by the end of the date. He does not necessarily expect sex or a hot-and-heavy makeout session. But he does expect a kiss. If he does not get a kiss by the end of the first DATE, a Potential Boyfriend® might not ask her out on a second DATE.

t5_2qpc3,skokage,1332363477,"The Boomerang is pure awesome:  http://www.boomerangmusic.com/  They have a couple different models so I can't say for certain if they are all the same.  The one I have (Boomerang® III Phrase Sampler ) allows you to record a part (I've never reached a time limit, so I'm guessing a couple minutes max on each channel), loop it over, stack multiple parts on a single recorded loop, and then switch between multiple loops you have recorded.  Actually, let me just copy/paste the features...  :-p  *Features *  •  Flexibility provided by 4 distinct Play Styles.      Serial Play Style - loops play one after the other for building a song in verse/chorus/bridge fashion.      Serial Master Play Style - For serial style loopers it's nice to have a rhythmic background behind the melodic loops. Mute          the strings and record a short ""chika-chika"" or beat on the sides of your acoustic axe. This rhythmic master loop can          then play along with any other loop.      Sync Play Style - all loops can play simultaneously and are synced so they stay together.      Free Play Style - all loops can play simultaneously and are NOT synced; this is great for creating ambient soundscapes.  •  3 or 4 loops - your choice. •  Stacking - ""stacking"" is adding a part to a loop (There is no limit to the number of parts you can stack.) •  Undo/Redo - the last part stacked can be muted, then played again or rerecorded. •  Erase - loops can be erased one at a time or all at once; some loops can be erased while others plays. •  Copy Loop - a complete loop can be copied whether it is playing or not. •  Copy Live - this enables ""re-sampling"" and is very powerful; the pedal's output is routed to a new loop. •  Octave - loop plays at half speed and an octave lower. •  Reverse - loop plays backwards. •  Once - loop plays one time through then stops or if already playing, it stops at its end. •  Stutter - enables repeatedly starting a loop over before it plays all the way through, sort of like record scratching. •  Fade - loop(s) fades in or out with one button press; fade time can be 3 to 43 seconds. •  Reverse Solo - this is a built-in effect and enables you to create reverse leads live. •  Two Sample Rates - 48KHz or 24KHz, both use 20 bit samples; through signal is always 48KHz / 24 bits. •  Thru Mute Function - turns off through signal. •  Expression Pedal Jack - connect an expression pedal for foot control of overall playback volume or Decay Rate. •  Volume Knobs      Serial &amp; Serial-Sync Play Styles         Volume controls playback level      Sync &amp; Free Play Styles         Volume controls playback level of loop 1         Vol 2 controls playback level of loop 2         Vol 3 controls playback level of loop 3         Vol 4 controls playback level of loop 4 •  Decay Rate Knob - sets the rate at which earlier parts fade when new ones are added; continuously variable from 0-100%. •  Stereo or Mono - recording and playback will be stereo or mono depending on which of the Smart Jacks you use. •  Smart Jacks - the RangTM III senses which jacks are being used and provides different signal routing options.",®

Kelty Triptease.  http://i.imgur.com/iMNbNh.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/TglE8h.jpg  Triptease Lightline is incredibly strong reflective cord for staking or guying out your tent.  Three-millimeter gold, reflective nylon cord Dyneema® core provides superior strength  It's not paracord, but is quite useful, and the reflective part is pretty nice.  Also since it's thinner than 55o paracord, there is a much longer length on the wrap, which would be much more useful than the few feet of paracord in normal wraps of these knives.

t5_2qh2a,derrb,1332465285,"You have good content, and it takes balls to put out writing especially when photogs are certainly more visual people. I want to encourage that, but to do so i'm going to be a bit of a copywriting dominatrix.  I feel like this isn't your website, since the names don't match and you have a blurb at the bottom. If you have some control over captions, for the love of god: standardize the bylines. Half are ""[Informational cation]. Photo credit: not-crazy"" then there's ""[photo title]. ©not-crazy"". It's a peeve that I doubt most people would notice, but it disrupts the rhythm.  Your content has some good, basic framework. However, I'd recommend you segment it a bit more. Writing for the web needs to be more organized because the attention span is so limited. Make what they're looking for easy to find, *then* have the meat of info. It feels like haphazard namedropping when the text links are in sentences. So maybe something closer to:       basic intro stating purpose of article. (don't label it introduction. We know it's an intro).     **Preproduction**         Intro to why it's important         **Recommended product name #1**             description, use, and other miscellany             end with price point and way to purchase.         **Recommended product name #2**             Another description     **Next section**  and so on and so forth, ad nauseum.

It was really swollen, leaky and obviously painful. He spilt a little of my blood while I was holding him and applying ointment to his eye. It must have felt really good, because from that moment on he realized that I was good and there was finally someone in his life that wanted to help him. He started letting me pet his head and over time he's progressed to letting me do full body pets, but he is still traumatized. If other people try to pet him, he often bites them. Hard!

t5_2sokd,bluepepper,1332495080,"The trick is that it uses the planet's motion.  If there was a static planet, you'd be right: any acceleration gained by going towards the planet is canceled by the deceleration when you go away from the planet.  If you fall towards a planet at an initial speed of V, you will be back at a speed of V at the same point.  Like this:       → -----------_      V             \                  ☺  |                    /      ← -----------¯      V  And that's also true for a moving planet, as long as V is measured relatively to the planet.  But what happens if we measure the speed relatively to the sun?  So let's say the spacecraft is moving at a speed of V (relatively to the sun) towards the planet, and the planet is itself moving at a speed of U (relatively to the sun) towards the spacecraft.  It means the spacecraft is approaching the planet at a speed of V+U.  So it will also leave the planet at a speed of V+U relative to the planet, but in the opposite direction, which makes it a speed of V+2U relative to the sun.       → -----------_      V             \                ← ☺  |                U   /      ← -----------¯      V+2U  This (exaggerated and simplified) slingshot just accelerated your spacecraft by two times the speed of the planet.

t5_2qh13,Fredsenra,1332584796,"Jeep® is the oldest off-road/sport utility vehicle brand. In 1940 the US Army put out specifications to the automobile industry for a vehicle they wanted for the future. The Army knew that they needed a vehicle that could withstand many different terrains and conditions. The first prototype delivered to the Army was from the American Bantam Car Company which had just brought Karl Probst on board for the project. Two other prototypes were produced by Ford and Willys-Overland. The Army felt that the American Bantam Car Company was too small to supply the number of vehicles needed and it then allowed Ford and Willys-Overland to make attempts on their designs after seeing Bantam's vehicle in working order. Willys-Overland offered the lowest bid and won the initial contract. Willys-Overland now had what would become the standardized jeep design. In early 1941 the company showed the off-road performance by driving it up the steps to the US Capital Building in Washington, DC. They started work building the new MB military vehicles at their plant in Toledo, Ohio.",®

Each serving provides 1,000mg of Phase 2 Carb Controller®; a clinically tested ingredient that inhibits the enzyme responsible for digesting starch into simple sugars your body can absorb.  Dreamfields made similar claims which was shown to be bullshit for their patented pasta recipe. I don't know if this has a similar magic ingredient but the claims are effectively the same - allow you to eat foods that aren't keto but make it ""ok"" to do so.  So it's a way of preventing the carbs you eat from turning into glucose (or delaying it). It's just an excuse to cheat unless you plan on CKD or TKD in which case you are purposefully carbing up BECAUSE you want to use that glucose from starch for extended workouts and muscle training.  If you're going to have a cheat day because you like the taste of cake - why not just have a cheat day? Why start pissing around with expensive pills?

[Halakhic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halakha) [exegesis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exegesis) infers that, since the punishment is monetary rather than execution, the unborn fetus is not considered a living person and feticide is not murder (cf.

You maneuver the sword to try and get past the enemy's guard, and they switch it faster than you can swing, so you just have to wildly flail around and hope you land some hits. I never got very far, so I don't have a lot of other complaints, but that was my main one.  Twilight Princess on the other hand had more traditional controls, even on the Wii. Press button, do move. The art style was my favorite out of all the games, the characters seemed likable, and then there's Midna. ♥♥♥ I normally hate a darker story, but TP got it right.

t5_2qh0r,fairwellIMJA,1332693421,"Hi. The first thing I'd like to say is there are two types of ""votes"", the first is the non-binding straw poll and that is a beauty contest that usually has no value. Then there is the selection of delegates from districts and counties that go on to the State and then the National conventions.    The difference between a ""Democracy"" and a ""Republic"" is this proses of selecting the delegates that make up something called ""The electoral collage"" that elects our president.   Take Missouri for an example. In the non-binding straw poll the results were:  Rick Santorum        138,957    55.2%  Mitt Romney           63,826    25.3%  Ron Paul               30,641    12.2%   Other                  18,444     7.3%  But when it came to the caucuses the delegates (to the state convention) in counties went:  Jackson County - Paul = 105, Romney = 39, Frothy = O, Newt = O   St. Louis - Paul = 36, Romney = O, Frothy = O, Newt = O   It went that way for more or less the whole state. So when the MSM tells you Santorum won, they are not being honest with you. They are trying to break down your moral.   The most important thing you could do is see this vid: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OynCgwmD-HM&amp;feature=player_embedded about how our ""government"" does **not** count the votes, nor does the republican party, rather an outfit out of Spain that is owned by the military industrial complex is given all of the uncounted votes, and they tell the MSM what they say the vote totals are.    Thank you and have a Ron Paul day. ☺ ",☺

t5_2s4kl,coolwhip6394,1332701149,"Oh wow......... OKAY, you need to go out and find things that you love. Find passions and hobbies. Find goals and priorities. You need to find the things that make you you and that are important for you. If you are willing to love and care for someone you started dating imagine how much love and care you could emanate for someone that you can be friends with, count on and most importantly someone who will reciprocate all the feelings. DO NOT let someone have complete control over your happiness because you are a worthy individual that does not deserve that. Don't let it happen. I went through a very tough time in my life too. My mother was literally killing herself everyday with crack while  I had an evil stepmother and an apathetic father. ALL of this while I was trying to get good grades at school and succeed in life, Classsifying your happiness only makes you less happy. Find love and joy in everything you do. I like helping people so when I volunteered at a hospital and got to touch people and help them ion the most minute way that made me happy, I got a job at Mcdonald's and it was a bitch but I was helping people while being independent and getting money. i took pride in that and that made me happy. I played piano so when  I used my high school's $40,000 grand piano I felt joy. I'm overweight, so when I run 4 miles nonstop I feel joy. Go out and live, find the things that make you happy and make life so much more beautiful. Finding a person to share your love with is wonderful but when you don't have it you cannot let that bring you down. Love yourself and take pride in what you do before loving someone else..  I wish you the best bud! ♥",♥

t5_2s46r,buffalo442,1332708328,"Few things, just basically comments reading through the platform.  ""◦ Clubs will no longer be compelled to attend SA events in order to maintain their budget...  ◦ Community service requirements will be reduced from two community service events a semester, to two community service events a year.""  Fully support the first one, as frankly, SA events are mostly crap...not much of a point, just more hoops for clubs.  But why lower the community service?  4 times per year isn't that much...say at 2-3 hours each, that's not much at all.  Gets the clubs out into the community...as far as I'm concerned, community service doesn't have to be raking leaves or helping at a homeless shelter.  ""◦ The Student Association will also give budget increases based on success in competitions. In short, under the REASON Party's Administration, SA will reward success and effort.""  This is great.  If less money went to the clubs that just held banquet after banquet, and more to the clubs who actually go out and do something productive, we'd all benefit.  ""◦ SA will implement a guaranteed van policy, in which if a club can provide two-months notice on request for a van, a van will be guaranteed to the Club. ▪ Additionally, the REASON party will maintain two vans on short order, meaning that two vans will be reserved for clubs requesting vans with less than two weeks notice. This will allow clubs with an immediate need for transportation to acquire vans consistently.""  This is great as well.  The vans sucked this year.  No responses from the coordinator, or getting rejected 2-3 days before the trip after asking numerous times.  Does not make it easy on the clubs.  2 months is a lot, as often events aren't known about that far in advance, but I'd imagine there's probably a procedural/legal/expense issue in shortening that.  ""◦ A separate Nationals line will be reserved to the Sports Council, allowing for funds to be immediately granted to those clubs who need money to attend National Championships. Under the REASON Party, no club will be unable to attend Nationals due to lack of funds.""  How about non-sports clubs that make it to a national competition?  ""◦ The REASON Party will reexamine the Alcohol Policy, and advocate for more open bars at SA events such as Academic and Engineering Ball as well as at other large-scale club events and banquets. Financial assistance will be provided in certain cases to help clubs pay security costs associated with having alcohol at club events.""  Good luck...this would be great as well...can be a hassle now.  ""◦ The SA Book Exchange will be better promoted on Campus, the Department of Student Affairs will work to promote the efficacy of the program and ensure its expansion within the student body.""  This is one of the best things SA has to offer, and it's a shame that it has been neglected over the past few years.  Actually, the website just plain sucks in general.  But please don't pay some ungodly amount to fix it again.",▪

t5_2qh1i,telenull,1332779824,"But usually the password requirement isn't *exactly* 8 characters, it's 8+ characters... On good systems, there is no upper bound because the hashing algorithm is stream based and can handle whatever amount of data you throw at it and still outputs a uniform hash. So the amount of passwords you disallow by not allowing anything under 8 characters is negligible.  Take, for example a password system that requires 8+ characters, 1+ special, 1+ number and 1+ capital, it allows all ascii characters (including control chars, which are escaped before being shoved into the hashing algorithm). The number of available passwords is:       (255^128) - (255^7) = 1.089e308  And if you take away all of the requirements, but still allow the full ascii character set with an unspecified upper bound of 128:      255^128 = 1.089e308  The number of possibilities is so large that sectoring off a relatively tiny chunk of them as being too weak is still good security practice because you eliminate easy to guess passwords (e.g. jesus, password, stupid, 123456, etc) without shrinking your available password pool by any reasonable amount.  And yes, if you were wondering, I have used a 128 character password before. It also contained characters like the UTF-8 snowman (☃).  Edit: Take a look at the [graph of y = 255 ^ x](http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=y+%3D+x+%5E+128#sclient=psy-ab&amp;hl=en&amp;q=y+%3D+255+%5E+x&amp;oq=y+%3D+255+%5E+x&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=1&amp;gs_l=serp.3...53828l59641l1l59943l7l7l0l0l0l0l163l791l1j6l7l0.pfwe.1.&amp;pbx=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.,cf.osb&amp;fp=b6606e447fc8ca53&amp;biw=1118&amp;bih=589).

t5_2s7tt,radicand,1332813754,"background: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/26/deadmau5--madonna-molly-ultra-_n_1379437.html  When Madonna took to the stage Saturday night to introduce Avicii at Miami's Ultra Music Festival, she asked, ""How many people in this crowd have seen molly?""  Molly is a slang term for MDMA, the active chemical in ecstasy, a drug often associated with electronic dance music (EDM) concerts. The crowd erupted in cheers after Madge asked the question (see video of Madonna on stage at the bottom of this article), but not everyone in the EDM community was happy.  Deadmau5, one of the leading producers of progressive house music, took to Twitter and Facebook to rail against the pop star for what he called grossly irresponsible behavior.  ""Very classy there madonna. ""HUR DUR HAS ANYONE SEEN MOLLY???"" such a great message for the young music lovers at ultra,"" he posted on Facebook early Monday morning. ""quite the f'n philanthropist. but hey, at least yer HIP AND TRENDY! fucking cant smack my head hard enough right now.""  Madonna, whose album MDNA was released today, has yet to respond to the Canadian producer.  To Deadmau5 (whose real name is Joel Zimmerman), Madonna was trading on a negative association to appear relevant. By casually referencing MDMA usage at an event attended by 150,000 concertgoers and streamed online to tens of thousands more, the pop star helped cement an association that Zimmerman and other performers have fought to disprove.  Some fans, however, didn't take Zimmerman's side. When one Twitter user suggested that Deadmau5's music is enjoyed by ecstasy users, the artist quickly said he doesn't condone that behavior:   DJ DAZE@djdaze 26 Mar 12 @deadmau5 do you need to be reminded that you would be pointless if it wasn't for molly and ecstasy ?  deadmau5 ✔ @deadmau5  @djdaze i'd give up my entire career to remove the fucking rampant stupidity thats plagued my favorite type of music in an INSTANT. 26 Mar 12 ReplyRetweetFavorite ""I can appriciate her meteoric career, and all good deeds done, but WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT?"" he added on Facebook. ""That's your big contribution to EDM? Thats your big message to ultra attendies? hipsterspeak for looking for drugs? fuck off you fucking IDIOT.""  In a follow-up blog post, Zimmerman clarified his remarks and insisted that the discussion was about responsibility. Responding to criticism that he was a hypocrite for having smoked cigarrettes while live-streaming from his studio, Zimmerman said never tries to make his ""vices"" look cool or appealing, especially to his younger fans.  He also expressed concern about what comments like Madonna do to the EDM community:  It really hurts me to see rampant ADVOCATION of extreme bullshit lifestyles to a genre that spans pretty much any age gap these days ... I just feel like ive been kicked in the balls for a dollar. I’ve always been into electronic music, as far back as i can remember… and around the beginning, i really do remember the times the events i loved were pretty much outlawed by my city simply due to its speculated over-excessive drug use, and the media coverage that everyone loves to lap up around it. Yeah, that bummed me out… kinda made me feel like… how could something so damn interesting, artful, fun and just plain cool, be frowned upon by most…. but look at us now, allthough not completely, and never like to be completely, the dark veil has been lifted slightly and the music and good times and technology is starting to shine through more and more than “the latest breaking news about such and such a drug found only at these underground TECHNO RAVES - Tonight on fox!”  Zimmerman recently collaborated with Chris James, a fan who submitted vocals for Zimmerman's new song, ""The Veldt,"" on Twitter. Since Zimmerman has taken to live-streaming any work he does in his new home studio, the entire process was captured on camera. After being inspired by James' lyrics, Zimmerman took to his blog to explain why he shuns collaborations with big name artists in favor of more organic projects like ""The Veldt.""",✔

t5_2qpc3,moldylocks,1332856944,"Edit: Sorry, as a Jazz owner/player I assumed you meant a Fender Jazz.  Exactly what bass are you talking about?  From the Fender site: [The Jazz Bass® Guitar: A History and Appreciation](http://www.fender.com/news/index.php?display_article=503)  The Jazz Bass has been an instrument of choice for some of the most creative minds and talented hands in music, making its sound a ubiquitous presence in popular music for five decades now. Even a short list of players known for the using the instrument is most impressive—Joe Osborn, Jack Casady, Noel Redding, Larry Graham, Herbie Flowers, Greg Lake, Jaco Pastorius, John Paul Jones, Sting, Geddy Lee, Marcus Miller, Flea, Ron Blair, Adam Clayton and Verdine White.  When you’re listening to the Jimi Hendrix Experience, Sly &amp; the Family Stone, Emerson Lake and Palmer, Led Zeppelin, the Police, Rush, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers and U2, you are very often listening to a Jazz Bass.  When you hear the breathtaking bass breaks by John Entwistle on the Who’s immortal “My Generation,” by John Paul Jones in Led Zeppelin’s “Good Times Bad Times” and by Geddy Lee in Rush’s “YYZ,” you’re hearing a Jazz Bass.  Jack Casady’s spooky line in Jefferson Airplane’s “White Rabbit” and his sinuous line winding throughout “Somebody to Love”? A Jazz Bass. The even spookier psychedelic blues parts woven by Jones into Zeppelin’s “Dazed and Confused” and by U.K. session great Herbie Flowers into David Bowie’s “Space Oddity”? A Jazz Bass. Even great bassists who aren’t widely known as Fender players have used the Jazz Bass at one time or another—Paul McCartney is known to have played a left-handed model on The Beatles (the “White Album”), and Yes-man Chris Squire includes one in his arsenal.  And then there’s funk, soul and disco. An entirely new way of playing a bass guitar—the irresistibly funky and technically sophisticated slap-and-pop bass odyssey pioneered by Larry Graham in the 1960s with Sly &amp; the Family Stone—was launched with a Jazz Bass. Among the great many notable exponents to play the Jazz this way, standouts include William “Bootsy” Collins, who played his with James Brown in the 1960s before making bass history with Parliament-Funkadelic in the 1970s; Verdine White with hit factory Earth, Wind &amp; Fire; and Michael “Flea” Balzary, who often used his 1961 Jazz Bass to bring the style to prominence in modern rock music with the Red Hot Chili Peppers.",®

t5_2s837,ahnold11,1332873039,"Oh totally, your reaction to the game is very reasonable.  There are a lot of people already invested in the Elder Scrolls experience, who forget what it might be like to someone starting it for the first time.  On paper, Skyrim really seems like a boring skeleton of a game. Weak combat, Weak Story, weak characters (I'm being a little harsh here), not a ton of actual gameplay variety.  And yet, it is hugely popular, because few games give you that ""sense of place"" the feeling that you are in a fully realized world (even if it's an illusion), that there is stuff going on around you.  It's not your typical immersion/atmosphere like in a say a Bioshock, but something more su btle, and yet also stronger.  You want to be a part of that world, and you generally get the feeling that you want to do *things* in that world, just to be a part, just to immerse yourself in it. Even if any of those individual things on their own, isn't that compelling.  On the PC this gets even stronger, as with mods you can really add layers of depth to the game, and even address some of the gameplay shortcomings.  You hit the nail right on the head with the comment that you are in the Driver's seat. It's a core philosophy of the game, to basically always give you choice (not branching linear narrative story choice), but the choice to consume as little or as much in the game at whatever pace you choose.  It comes at a (unavoidable) cost though, since you can ""do everything"" in the game, at essentially any point. You can get into situations which are a bit far fetched (Someone has been captured and needs to be saved, but then I went off for 6 months and did a whole bunch of other stuff, and when I came back they are still waiting as if not a single second went past.)  They world isn't terribly dynamic, and doesn't react/tailo itself to what you do, but you get to do any/all of what you want, and are never locked out of anything.  Many people have trouble with the above as the lack of structure (or forced structure/pacing rather) means it's easy to wander off, get distracted, do a bunch of cool things, but not feel like you are making any connected/meaningful progress/purpose, and eventually drift away from the game.  You experienced that in your first 45mins, and in a way are lucky, because you can see that now, and if you go back, make a concentrated effort to stay on task (at least for the first little while) and hopefully have a really enjoyable experience.  Personally, the above really doesn't bother me. I spent 150hrs in the previous Game (Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion) and only made it maybe 1hr into the main story.  IT didn't matter because I really enjoyed the sense of the world, didn't plenty of interesting things, saw lots of places. It was fun, I enjoyed it, and the experience was like none other I've had in a video game.  (I tried going back years later, with the goal to ""finish the story this time"" with a new character, but only made it about 4hrs into the main story heh).  Heck I've probably played 4chars in Skyrim so far, about the same 150hrs, and there are still two whole cities I have yet to visit.  But I'm a bit of a special case, in that for me this game the story is less important, I get game stories in many other games, but in this one I get a sense of place, and a freedom to consume that place at any place/order I see fit.  You can hear many people say things like ""It's not the main story in Skyrim that is important, it's your story"", or ""Skyrim Stories®"" etc.  While it's not exactly like that (there isn't much of substance outside of game narrative that really cohesively holds together) there is some truth to it. The game has enough systems that you can set personal ""goals"" for yourself.  Tasks to accomplish.  ""Climb xxx tall mountain"".  ""Find yyy sword that gives an awesome special benefit"". ""Figure out the ingredients to get a cool invisibility potion"". ""Steal that guards cool shield"" ""Make an entire outfit of clothing that doubles what I can sell my goods for to shop keepers"".  Those tasks and the sense of accomplishment, coupled with the feeling that you are in the world, makes you feel like you have had meaningful (entertaining) experiences, that people like to label ""My Story"".  You can also make stuff up in your head and Role Play motivations, but that is a different topic all together ;)",®

I met some other female friends while I was there and have had several other female friends over the years.  I can't say I never considered dating any of them (which would be a rather strange admission, even if it were true), but I *can* say that I'm entirely happy with them as friends and have no reason at all to believe they don't reciprocate.

t5_2qpp6,Celebreth,1332929316,"Match 2: (Z) Liquid_Zenio vs (T) MarineKing_Prime --- ---  Game 1: [Daybreak] --- ---  MKP starting off with a fast command centre, going for a one rax expand, then due to Zenio's harass, forcing an offensive gas, which prevents any reactored hellion play - MarineKing just adds on two more rax and he's going to develop from there. Engineering bay starts up, and it looks like MKP's going to go for some VERY fast upgrades, going for a super heavy marine style build (staying true to his name.) Two reactors going down on two of the barracks, a tech lab on the third, and a factory starts up. Zenio's tossing down a roach warren, looks like he's doing SOMETHING, because there are SIXTEEN roaches on the way!! Marineking's not going to know about this, he's going to have stim and +1 against the mass roach, which isn't going to be the best scenario for Zenio. Zenio's not going to bother engaging the army as he sees it moving out, he's trying to force a base trade right now! Marineking loses all the SCV's at the expannsion, and thare are no combat shields coming out for MarineKing and OWCH. ONE moment of bad control means that MarineKing's push gets cleaned up, and it's hard to say who came out on top there! The zerg is ahead 15 workers , but Marineking has units, he's got a wall, and he still has his natural, and Zenio lost his expansion. Marineking with a drop into the main, doing MASSIVE damage, killing ALL the lings and blings, and MarineKing's just microing the HELL out of this drop, making it SO SO efficient, and there's the GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG!! MarineKing!! ♥  ###### GG MarineKing_Prime!  ---  Game 2: [Atlantis Spaceship] --- ---  I've actually never seen this map before o.o Badass!  MarineKing starts off with another one rax expand, transitioning into reactored hellions for the map control. Nice, solid opening coming out here for Marineking, and it'll pretty much just allow him  to go wherever he wants in the tree and not afraid of anything. Marineking's starting up a second factory here! Oooh, this'll be an interesting choice. He's adding on a tech lab on his second factory, so it's going to be a fast blue flame hellion push!  MKP isn't goint to let Zenio see what he's doing here, but Zenio has some nice game sense, getting THREE spines at the front already, just in case, and Zenio's going to use those to push out his creep, makiing a VERY good defensive line. And there MKP goes, running past the spines, the hellions are in the main and there are the roasted drones, the roasted queens, a lotta transfuses being used, all the blings die off, a second queen dies, and the zerglings are just going to get fried, Zenio gets a nice surround and kills off the hellions, but MKP with a NICE transition into heavy mech. MKP has a third base down, already getting his FOURTH (10:30), MKP has 2 armouries and getting double vehicle upgrades, he's getting two more factories and just building up his heavy metal.   Marineking still holding Map control with those hellions, he sees that the third is out for Zenio with a scouting barracks, and MKP just harassing, showing hellions near the third to force the drones away, just the mindgames. Oooooh! Neural parasite starting up for Zenio!!! I don't see this NEARLY enough, and it's the perfect response by Zenio. Zenio starting off his fourth, but he's going to lose it almost instantly, nad there's a MASSIVE hellion push to the third, they're all going to get fungalled and OWCH. Marineking has four bases established, he's expanding TWICE more and he's HEAVILY out-expanding the zerg player!  There's a massive engagement at the zerg's front, but Zenio's just going to lose EVERYTHING. Marineking with 6 thors and a TON of hellions, the hellions are going to easily rip through the zergling count, the thors will take care of the rest. There should have been some better neurals - only 2 neurals go down, and those infestors are easily taken out. Good game MKP!!!  ###### GG MarineKing_Prime!",♥

t5_2qh5b,blazingtruth,1332945293,"&gt;There's nothing in their essence or potentialities/potencies that dispositions them to exist (existence is not a predicate)  Specifically, dispositional essentialism (DE) is the *theory* that:  1. All fundamental properties are potencies – there are no (fundamental) categorical natural properties. 2. The laws of nature are consequences of the existence of potencies. 3. The laws of nature are necessary.  &gt;In another they necessarily (or rather, deductively) follow from the existence of those (like a systems approach).  Au contraire. DE arguably follows from Kripke's findings, as the claim that ""All fundamental properties are potencies"" is a necessary, synthetic, a posteriori truth. The subject concept ""fundamental properties"" does not contain the predicate concept ""potencies"".  ----  **WARNING: MODAL LOGIC AHEAD!**  Dispositional essentialism suggests that in all possible wolds, any object that possesses P is disposed to yield M in response to S. That is represented as the following:  (DEp) … □(Px→D(S,M)x).  And, also, this is a conditional analysis (CA), which is nothing but a logical equivalence:  (CA□) … □(D(S,M)x ↔ Sx □→Mx)  So, let P be a potency, i.e. some property with a dispositional essence, as in (DEp) above. Combine (DEp) with (CA□) and we have:  (I) … □(Px→(Sx□→Mx)).  Let x acquire the stimulus S, i.e.  (II) … Px&amp;Sx  By (I) and (II) we have:  (III) … Mx  Discharging (II) we have:  (IV) … (Px&amp;Sx)→Mx.  Since x is arbitrary we may generalize:  (V) … ∀x((Px&amp;Sx) →Mx  Since (V) holds in an arbitrary world w it is necessary:  (V□) … □(∀x((Px&amp;Sx) →Mx)  Which yields the conclusion:  (PNL) At least some of the laws of nature are metaphysically necessary. Then, further argumentation leads to a universality of PNL to the strong necessitarian form.  ---- &gt;If the question is posed of those particles themselves then I can see where DE comes in, saying that the essential properties of these particles dispositions them to behave in a certain manner.  The concern is with fundamental properties, yes.   &gt; There's nothing in their essence or potentialities/potencies that dispositions them to exist (existence is not a predicate)  Bird deals with this nicely, and responds to two arguments TLA (too little actuality) and TMP (too much potentiality) here: http://eis.bris.ac.uk/~plajb/research/papers/Potency_and_Modality.pdf  Here's another nice paper by Quentin Smith about common objections to DE and how an essentialist would respond (the most common of which comes from an ignorance of Kripke): http://logica.ugent.be/philosophica/fulltexts/67-3.pdf  ",↔

My point of view is that it is NOT your fault that she is having issues controlling her emotions. On a slightly related note: my children's father threatened the same thing when I left him, even held my gun to his head (though it wasn't loaded and he knew it). Didn't stop me from doing what I needed to do.  When you played the recording for her and told her where and when it was recorded did she make any ""guesses"" as to what it actually was? My point of view is that she WILL deny having cheated on you because the only evidence is an audio recording (I'm assuming no names were mentioned in it?) and she feels like you have no way of proving it was actually her. Go with your gut.  You need to stay strong for you and for your child. Good luck with whichever route you choose. ♥",♥

This is straight from the FAQ:  &gt;**How is a comment's score determined?**  &gt;According to the same principles as a submission's score.  &gt;A comment's score is simply the number of upvotes minus the number of downvotes. If five users like the comment and three users don't it will have a score of 2. Please note that the vote numbers are not ""real"" numbers, they have been ""fuzzed"" to prevent spam bots etc. So taking the above example, if five users upvoted the comment, and three users downvote it, the upvote/downvote numbers may say 23 upvotes and 21 downvotes, or 12 upvotes, and 10 downvotes. The points score is correct, but the vote totals are ""fuzzed"".

t5_2qh6c,LoststarWaffles,1332984622,"First time in [/r/Christianity](/r/Christianity) , so hi all!  First off, I would consider myself an Agnostic Athiest, but if I reflect, I guess I'm more of a Agnostic Theist.   As a kid, I was never pressured into any sorts of religion. I never went to church, and my parents weren't too religious. They would have the occasionally, oh hey there might be something out there, so just be a good person, but that was more of them talking to me about morals, rather than be good under god. I thought about it occasionally as a kid, but never too deeply. I never formed a relationship with Jesus. I never saw the appeal of worshiping someone who is dead to take your sins away. What truly made him better than anyone else? Another thing that sort of pushed me in my path is how religion is viewed. Again, I don't care for seeing a guy on a cross. Why do I want to look at a guy dying. Why do I care to see a woman praying? Its just these questions I asked myself to never really get pushed into Christianity. I didn't see Christianity over any other religion. What made God, Yahweh, Allah, or Zues, or any other god or goddess the right ones? Why does it matter so much that your going to hate the next guy, and what they believe.  Although it probably shouldn't, it also frustrates me to see my Christian friends to talk about Jesus, and how great he is. Your religion is yours, but I just feel awkward and out of place when I just hear about it. They show this undying love for someone they haven't met. They talk about how they won't do anything bad. ""Being sober and having God in my life and a fabulous family is the highest I have ever been in life and I LOVE LOVE it ♥"", but then I see them turn right around and talk crap about one of their friends. I just get this contradiction in my head, how can someone say they are happy and then hurt someone else. Its stuff like this that keeps me away from any religion. It makes me realize everyday how there are people that consider themselves true believers under a religion, but just go out and contradict it, or just force it upon others.  Another one of my friends has this rationale that America was founded purely on religion, that the founding fathers specifically wanted Christianity as the religion of America. It also pushes me away from religion that no matter what I do, I would not be able to convince this friend that he is wrong, that the founders of America specifically wanted the country to be free for all, not just strict Christians. I never said anything to him, because I feel he was too set in his ways to make a good argument to show him.  I sorta went off on a couple tangents about my friends, and probably didn't make sense in some parts, but its just a subject of religion in all I have strong opinions against. For those reading, didn't mean to target Christianity specifically, but that's what I grew up around. I feel the same way about all religions,  I don't have any problem against you believing what you want to believe, as long as you aren't spouting it out to the world as if yours is the best. I'm probably contradicting myself somewhere along but, Live life how you want to, and how you want to have fun, but don't spoil it for others, but be accepting as well, others have their own lives to live as well. Live by the Golden Rule or whatever.  TL;DR : Parents not to religious, grew up thinking for myself of what would be out there or not. Came to my own conclusion of ""eh, theres probably something, but who cares, I'm here, I'll live my life on here and try not worrying about the next.""",♥

t5_2sc5r,Lundix,1333058117,"Yeah I use tables just about always. Problem lies, in this case, in choosing what the 'main' symbol should be. I might do something like:  * **p**: Bob gets promoted CEO * **q**: Steve gets promoted CEO * **r**: The company opens a branch in Greece * **s**: The taxes stay low,  and then try out different solutions, like ...  * **((pVq)∧s)→r**, in which case the conditional is the undisputed point of emphasis. Problem is, even intuitively, this seems wrong. 'Only if' isn't nearly emphasized enough to my mind. So I move on to perhaps ...  * **s→(r↔(pVq))**, which seems a bit more promising. Now, I think I like ...  * **r↔((pVq)∧s)** better, but I can't fathom why. And it seems to me that the taxes shouldn't necessarily be included in the biconditional to that degree.  By my 'calculations' (ahem), the first two have pretty similar truth tables. The first one spells:   * *T T F T T T F T T T F T T T T T*,   The second one:   * *T T F T T T F T T T F T F T T T*.   The third one is a bit more different:   * *T F F T T F F T T F F T F F T T*.   Now this here is the rub. What next? Do I at this point extract the different lines from the truth matrix (or watchawecallit) where the statements ran true, and see which one encompasses most of the situations I would agree with, or perhaps see which one excluded most of the unacceptable scenarios?

It was a gay art showing - as in they were artists that were gay and this was their art. It was pretty contrived as my friends and I agreed (several of them are gay)...you know mostly graphic penes all up in thar and in models.   So we stand outside of the gallery which is a cul de sac and thus has no traffic. Everyone's milling around because they had large cans of Carlsberg for £1 apiece. Cans littered around everywhere and my friends creating their own large enough pile. So I start taking cans and arranging them in the street. I make the cans into the symbol: ♂ on the street with some of my group. We use crushed cans to symbolize ejaculation at the tip and then a lesbian friend squats at the ""head"" for science. Best part is that people start to take pictures of our ""art"" thinking it might be another exhibit or they just genuinely liked what we did. ",♂

t5_2cneq,tomnue,1333062384,"WHAT IS THE MEANING OF AMERICA?  My search for the meaning of America led me to consider an array of issues often as contradictory as the reasons why people vote, some as diverse as the ethnic antecedents of its citizenry and others which could be considered inflammatory.  As much as one can glean from the “newsertainment” we are bombarded with, like the annoying frequency of automobile commercials, we have serious issues in America:  A continuing world-wide potentially catastrophic financial crisis which various governments allegedly try to fix but without cooperation from the financial services industry which caused the crisis.  A war in Afghanistan waged, it is to be hoped, for reasons better than protecting 90% of the world’s opium/heroin production and smuggling and guaranteeing the continued corruption of the Karzai administration.  A presidential nominating campaign which, in its early stages, sadly shows all the signs of a pending “maturity” notable only for negativity, nastiness and waste of money which, alas, the American electorate predictably and mindlessly loves.   A never before seen national epidemic in illegal drug trafficking from/through Mexico, our number one trading partner, the resulting drug addiction and drug related crime in America so monstrous it has all but neutralized our federal, state and local law enforcement.  If this isn’t terrorist activity waged by a foreign country against America, what is?  A system of education that often doesn’t educate and is continually downsized by budget-cutting state and local governments.  Racial Prejudice which is still the cornerstone of the “American Dilemma” followed closely by religious intolerance.  Unparalleled child neglect, abuse and sexual exploitation.   The plague of Sexually Transmitted Disease which if not stopped may prevent generations of Americans from producing children.  Twenty-five percent of all American women are sexually molested.  Despite the “good” news about the American economy there are ever growing numbers of homeless, hungry, unemployed and despondent American men, women and children and this includes far too many Vets. By contrast to this terrifying growth, the numbers of billionaires, alas, show a small increase to where there are only twelve-hundred.   Faced today by these and other issues, almost unimaginable a generation ago, the American people focus on and base their actions on what really defines the meaning of America: “ME”.  Thank you Mr. Zuckerberg.  I did, of course, find most Irishmen sober but few, if any honest politicians:  As so aptly stated by Mark Twain, “There is no native American criminal class except the U.S. Congress.”        © Dave Henrie www.tomnue.com (blog in work) March 29, 2012  “The most sacred duty of government is to do equal and impartial justice to all its citizens.”	       Thomas Jefferson, 1816 ",©

t5_2s453,amjwh99,1333068750,"After getting diagnosed with Crohns, my GI recommended I immediately get on Remicade. I was really scared and didn’t want to do it, so I went and got a second opinion. The other doctor told me I could try 6mp. Another immunosuppressive with increased risk of infection, but after doing some research it seemed less scary. I ended up choosing 6MP.   A few months later, my diet was cleaned up; I was feeling good with no symptoms. Then I got on a plane for a 2 week business trip to another country. The second I landed I knew something was wrong. My Crohns was back. (In my situation stress triggers my symptoms more than anything.)  Once I returned home, I consulted with another GI and we decided it was time to get on Remicade. I finally had my first infusion today. Keeping my fingers crossed it works.    There was really one big reason as to why I decided to start Remicade this time around:  I felt pressured by my first GI to start the drug, but my new doctor handle it completely different. This time the decision was mine and he was only there to present the facts and answer any questions. In addition to that, he offered two other treatment options.  He explained everything to me. Even mention the following (According to my doctor about 50 cases to date): “Postmarketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma, a rare type of T-cell lymphoma, have been reported in patients treated with TNF blockers, including REMICADE®. These cases have had a very aggressive disease course and have been fatal. All reported REMICADE® cases have occurred in patients with Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis and the majority were in adolescent and young adult males. All of these patients had received treatment with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine concomitantly with REMICADE® at or prior to diagnosis. Carefully assess the risks and benefits of treatment with REMICADE®, especially in these patient types. “   I’m a 24 male so when he told me this I was terrified, but I was desperate to feel better. At this point the benefits outweighed the risks.   Remicade can change peoples lives, it was FDA approved in 1998 and more than 1.3 million people worldwide have already taken it. It could be right for you. Lol sorry if I sound like a salesperson. I really hope you start feeling better soon. Starting a new med is really scary stuff. I’ve taken methotrexate, 6mp, and now remicade. I have no idea  what the future holds, but I’m much happier when my crohns is at bay.

On the football field, you always know where the quarterback is throwing the ball – even before he lets go. In baseball, you’re standing exactly where the ball is hit.” Mark shook his head. He had barely touched the cheeseburger sitting on his plate. “I haven’t seen anyone lay a hand on you in karate in almost a year.”  Vance’s smile disappeared. “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”  “For 3 years I’ve watched you do things that are absolutely amazing.” Mark explained. “I thought – hell, everyone thinks that you’re just an amazing athlete. But what I saw today makes me wonder if it’s something more.”  “What are you talking about? ” Vance asked quietly, his eyes downcast.  “What happened with Mary in lab today.” Mark accused. “You know, when I think about it, I’ve seen a thousand little coincidences that involved you, but catching that beaker before it landed on her head – that was just too perfect.”  Vance sat motionless, his eyes locked in a distant stare.

Talk to me!”  “You’d laugh if I told you.” Vance whispered.  “Try me.”  Vance took a deep breath and looked at his best friend. Maybe it was time for his secret to come out.

Mark sat patiently waiting for Vance to speak.  “The best way to explain it,” Vance started, “is to just be blunt.” He paused as if trying to convince himself to speak. “I can see the future.”  “What?” Mark laughed. “You think you’re Nostradamus or something? Why haven’t you won the lotto?”  “No. Nothing like that.” Vance replied. “I only see what will happen in the next couple of seconds.”  Mark looked confused. “I don’t understand.”  Vance looked at Mark. “I only see things just seconds before they happen. The more important they seem to be, the more time I get. I can see a phone ringing maybe a second before it happens. On the football field, I get two or three. Sometimes, when there’s danger, I get four or five seconds. Never more than that.”  Mark looked at Vance and asked, “How long…?

Lately I’ve been able to actually focus it on something. Like with Mary. I was trying to foresee what she would say if I asked her to the prom. That’s when I saw the beaker fall. Two seconds later, I reached over and caught it.”  After a moment of silence, Vance stood up. “Let’s go home.”  They stood up, put on their coats to ward off the chill outside, and walked out the door in silence. Both lost in their own thoughts as they walked past the stores in the strip mall.  “So, are you some kind of Prophet?” Asked Mark.  “I dunno.” Vance pulled his knit cap over his ears. “I’ve looked everywhere for information; the Internet, the library, the church. I don’t think there’s really a word for what I am. It’s just vatic visions pop into my…” Vance stopped suddenly, his eyes darting to the left then right. “Get down!” he screamed as he dragged Mark to the ground.  As Mark went down, the window to the jewelry store exploded. The chair used to shatter the glass sailed where he stood a split second before. He froze as two masked gunmen came through the now nonexistent window.  Vance quickly rolled onto the balls of his feet. Like lightning, he leaped in the air, spun backwards and extended his leg. The heel of his boot met firmly with the temple of the first man. The robber crumpled in to a heap.  This placed the second man behind Vance. He raised his pistol, pointed it at Vance, and pulled the trigger.  Vance dropped into a crouch, the bullet flying harmlessly over his head. He kicked back, crushing the bandit’s kneecap. The gun fell to the ground as the robber collapsed in pain.  Vance looked at Mark, in shock, but unhurt on the ground inches away from the carnage. “Mark, don’t let them know it was me!” Vance ran around the corner of the building and quickly disappeared.  Mark mumbled, still amazed by what happened, ""You're no Prophet, you're a Superhero.""  Sirens pierced the air and in moments police had the gunmen in handcuffs and were questioning witnesses.  “You were closest to the action,” the cop asked Mark. “Did you see who that guy was?”  “It was Va…um…” Mark stammered. “His name is Vatic”   **©2005 by Icepigs**",©

t5_2qorf,KissYourButtGoodbye,1333182131,"&gt;I'll say it again: you cannot bring up 'lost potential sales' until you establish that copyrights and patents are indeed the same as real property.  Again, intellectual property is property in the same way as any other. If I take my labor and ""mix"" it with resources (those used to produce the information), then it is my property. This doesn't stop working because it is digital property.  I like how you ignored that argument entirely.   &gt;Oh, holy shit! So you agree with me that an invention, idea, etc. are not property?  No.  Patents function very differently from copyright, and you continue to ignore that by lumping everything together as ""IP"".  You also neglect the subset that is trademark, which I would classify as fraud by attempting to pass off a product as produced by someone when it is not.  &gt;I'm not trying to rebut Rothbard, I'm defending my own position that copyrights are not property.  And I argued, using Rothbard's freely provided arguments, that they are.  You have to refute those arguments to show they are not.  To quote him once more:  &gt; Let us consider copyright. A man writes a book or composes music. When he publishes the book or sheet of music, he imprints on the first page the word “copyright.” This indicates that any man who agrees to purchase this product also agrees as part of the exchange *not* to recopy or reproduce this work for sale. In other words, the author does not sell his property out­right to the buyer; he sells it *on condition* that the buyer not reproduce it for sale. Since the buyer does not buy the property outright, but only on this condition, any infringement of the con­tract by him or a subsequent buyer is *implicit theft* and would be treated accordingly on the free market. The copyright is there­fore a logical device of property right on the free market.  And the patent is only incompatible *insofar as it extends beyond the copyright protection of information to the barring of similar, or even identical, productions independently arrived at with no knowledge of the ""original"" production*.  &gt;The point of contention is that I am not allowed to use my property to transcribe your poem without your permission. My property rights have been restricted.  No more than any restrictions against other forms of theft of property.  You cannot use your car to transport my property back to your residence.  That is a restriction on your use of your property.  And yet, this is sensible and just.  &gt;You are free to keep it out of the public, but once it is out there, it is free reign.  This line of reasoning would also result in everything in the ""public"" domain being free reign - including physical objects in stores.  There is no ""public"" - there are a series of private systems, all of which would have justly acquired the information I produced by agreeing to my contractual copyright.  &gt;You literally have a copyright of your paragraphs that you just wrote.  No, I don't.  Part of the agreement to use reddit limits my copyright on what I post here.  And more accurately, you have followed copyright anyway by citing them as my words and quoting them.  &gt;I can make a copy, and you still have your original pdf.  That is still theft.  You are conflating the information content - something which was produced through the mixing of labor and resources, and *is therefore property* - with the digital medium it is conveyed through.  Assume, for a moment, that there was no copyright protections enforced by the State.  Assume further that I, as a producer, require everyone to sign (or otherwise agree to) a contract that stipulates that  their use of the information I produced is limited, so they cannot copy it to sell or give to another (except for small excerpts for a limited subset of uses with appropriate citation).  Effectively, this contract functions no differently than current copyright law.  Is this not acceptable protection of the result of my labor (i.e. my *property*)?  And if this is the case, why is a law (under monopolistic law or not) recognizing © as the indication of that agreement practically different?",©

Obviously, modest amounts of cereal grains can be a part of the diets of most people with effects that, at least given our current state of knowledge, can be considered negligible.    so yea....   I'm going to go ahead and say still sounds like un-scientifically-founded sensationalist bullplop to me.   In the same vein as ""Earthing"".
