t5_2qi0a,burito,1325415801,"&gt; you seem determined not to account for in some sort of luddite rose-tinted way.  Now now, personal attacks are not cricket.  &gt; First - it saves typing. Its not about not having to remember an api, its about not having to type it. Which means - you don't get pointless abbreviations, leading to much more understandable code.  I think most folks will agree, intense abbreviations are a Bad Thing™. But so is needless verbosity. I think we can agree there is a middle ground, and the two camps tend to stick to their respective sides of this middle ground.  One of the most effective tools in the war against software bugs, is reduced complexity. The greatest ally of this, is the 80 char line limit. It forces you to limit your levels of nesting, and very long variable names and Intellisense are the enemy of the 80 char line limit.  We can argue over this until the cows come home, and all we'll be left with is opinion. Allow me to pose some evidence. The most stable software in the world, the OpenBSD kernel, is *not* written with Intellisense. Name one program written with the aid of Intellisense that has greater than 5 years of continuous uptime? *While connected to the internet*. You can't? Oh so you're conceding the debate? Ok then.   &gt; Second - it leads to better, simpler APIs.  This is outright bullshit. Good programmers result in better, simpler APIs. Intellisense pushes things in the extremely wordy end of the spectrum. If you need lots of words to clearly describe your code, then you have failed at writing simple, clean code.  &gt; (Edit) you seem to view intellisense as a crutch used by those who can't remember what to type. I see it as a timesaver for those who know exactly what to type.  Then you good sir would be the extreme minority. The stability of the two camps software is rather clear evidence which one is closer to the truth.  One thing you will not find me arguing, is Intellisense allows one to code quicker. Take your small win and bugger off. This is a thread about bug detection and resolution, your camp has a tremendous body of evidence showing they are not very good at it on the whole. Maybe when Windows and friends are used to control space ships, banking databases, the majority of high availability web servers, this debate can be re-opened. Until then, move along.  ",™

t5_2qpp6,Herpaderpa12345,1325418776,"Let me explain to you retards why Reddit is superior to /v/ in every conceivable way.  You guys are basement dwelling assholes spewing nothing but hate and contempt for everything and everyone, hiding behind the Anonymous tag. In the mean time, Reddit is a thriving constructive community that actually does something good.  You have somehow deceived yourselves that because Reddit occasionally reposts an image from /v/, that makes them the hellhole of the internet. You cry about your ""original content"" being stolen, which is funny, because every single day there are pictures that originated on Reddit being posted in these Starcraft threads.  Original content. That's another funny thing. You act like your funny captions for a quick laugh get attention on another site. That's the Original Content™ you are so proud of. You know what Reddit's OC is? It's weekly community Starcraft tournaments for every skill level. It's massive tournaments with a $15,000+ dollar prizepool. But hey, /v/ has tournaments too right? Sure you do! You have the /v/sl! And MrSnibbles!  What else is Reddit's OC? It's funding two separate Starcraft documentaries with great potential. It's bringing an extremely popular fan favorite to an international event, just because they like him. It's starting up an entire esports site with Starcraft focus. It's going to events, creating the hype and making signs. It's coverage, live reports, and post-event reports, pictures and travel reports of all the major Starcraft tournaments.   But that doesn't matter. Because every other day someone submits a picture of Rachel and some Koreans with a Brazzer's logo photoshopped in. And that makes Reddit the scum of the earth.   /v/ is a cesspool that has never done anything good for anyone. ",™

t5_2qh03,brandeis1,1325459396,"Let's see if I can bullet point this.  * Player, regardless of innocence to the issue at hand, gets suspended (not permanently banned).  * Player goes to cancel service. * Player cannot cancel service while suspended (NOT BANNED), which means player may be forced to pay for additional services he/she may not agree to, and may never use.  Let's compare this to a different game, WoW.  If you are suspended, you can still cancel your subscription at any time.  If you are permanently banned, you can't access Account Management for that license - BUT your recurring subscription will be automatically canceled, making additional charges a non-issue.  Bioware/EA does not seem to follow this, if I'm getting the right drift from all these stories. This made me want to look into their TOS to see if they've allotted for this legally. Here's what I found.  **TLDR:**  **EA/Bioware can hold you accountable for any amount of money you paid prior to being suspended, including the cost of the game and any previously initiated account subscriptions/game time. After that fact, anything they try to get from you that you had no control over disagreeing to MAY be disputable, and the fact they are withholding your ability to cancel your services seems to go against their own legal documentation.**  **TOS** ([Source](http://tos.ea.com/legalapp/WEBTERMS/US/en/PC/))  **Under Section 8, Paid Services, bold mine for emphasis:** *""If any change is unacceptable to you, **you may cancel your subscription at any time**, but EA will not refund any fees that may have accrued to your Account before cancellation of your subscription, and we will not prorate fees for any subscription.""*  This would mean that legally speaking, any charges issued prior to a suspension by EA would hold water and not be subject to a chargeback (which means you could get held accountable for credit card fraud, as any previous charges to this would have been approved by you). However, if they remove your ability to cease these charges, arguably anything AFTER your suspension would be debatable, as you are no longer able to end your agreement, per what's stated above.  In the same section: *""If you fail to provide EA any of the foregoing information, you agree that EA may continue charging you for any subscription automatically renewed unless you cancel your subscription at least thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the subscription.""*  This is extremely interesting, because in theory, this means that if you don't keep your information up to date (including your agreement to a reoccurring subscription) within 30 days of the next time you'll be charged, they can *legally* hold you accountable for subscription fee. The only argument so far, again, is that they are removing your capacity to disagree with their terms. So, let's keep looking for that.  **Section 9, Termination of EA Services:**  *""If your Account, or a particular subscription for an EA Service associated with your Account, is terminated, suspended and/or if any Entitlements are selectively removed, revoked or garnished from your Account and/or if your device is temporarily or permanently banned from accessing some or all EA Services, **no refund will be granted, no Entitlements will be credited to you or converted to cash or other forms of reimbursement, and you will have no further access to your Account or Entitlements associated with your Account or the particular EA Service.**""*  All this says is that you no longer have the right to anything on your account. What this does NOT determine is whether or not the ability to cancel a subscription you initially agreed to is one of the entitlements described above, but I could easily see a lawyer spinning this in either direction. So far, this is the most concrete evidence to ""Sorry, you're screwed"" that I've found in this situation, but it's most certainly not definitive.  **Section 10, Cancellation of Your Account**  *""You have the right to cancel your Account or a particular subscription to an EA Service at any time.  If you do not agree to the terms in this Terms of Service, your sole remedy is to not use EA Services and to cancel your Account or applicable subscriptions.  You understand and agree that the cancellation of your Account or a particular subscription is your sole right and remedy with respect to any dispute with EA, including any dispute related to, or arising out of: (1) any term of this Terms of Service or EA's enforcement or application of this Terms of Service; (2) the Content and Entitlements available through EA Services or any change in Content or Entitlements provided through EA Services; (3) your ability to access and/or use EA Services and/or any Content or Entitlements thereon; or (4) the amount or type of fees, surcharges, applicable taxes, billing methods, or any change to the fees, applicable taxes, surcharges or billing methods for EA Services and/or any Content or Entitlements thereon.*  *Contact EA's Customer Service Department at help.ea.com, support.popcap.com (for PopCap products) or swtor.com/support (for Star Wars™: The Old Republic) to cancel your Account.  EA reserves the right to collect fees, surcharges or costs incurred before you cancel your Account or a subscription to an EA Service.  You are also responsible for any amounts owed to third-party vendors or content providers before your cancellation.  Any delinquent or unpaid fees and other unresolved issues with EA Services must be settled before you establish a new Account.""*  This is exactly what we're looking for. I'm no lawyer, but while you would still be held responsible for any purchases made prior to your cancellation, you should still maintain the right to cancel your account at any time, regardless of disputes related to EA, including violation of their other terms.  So, sticking you in a recurring subscription is NOT something they should be able to do, and if they try to do this to you, you should have every right to fight it. However, you can (and probably will) be held accountable for any purchases prior to your account suspension, and it's better off you don't file charge-backs related to anything other than the funds after that fact.  Of course, you can't ever take it to anything but small claims court.  **Section 20, Dispute Resolution By Binding Arbitration:**  ""**By accepting these terms, you and EA expressly waive the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.**  This agreement is intended to be interpreted broadly.  This Section covers any and all disputes between us (“Disputes”), including without limitation:  * claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory;  * claims that arose before this Agreement or any prior agreement (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising);  * claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class; and * claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.   *The only disputes that are not covered by this Section are the following:*    * a claim to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of your or EA’s (or any of EA’s licensors’) intellectual property rights;  * a claim related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, or unauthorized use; * In addition, nothing in this Section shall prevent either party from initiating a small claims court action.""*  I hope that at least, partially, clears things up.  *LOTS OF EDITS* I fixed a bunch of formatting, trying to distinguish the ToS from my own thoughts.

[The arab lobby](http://www.propublica.org/article/adding-it-up-the-top-players-in-foreign-agent-lobbying-718) is far more [influential than the israel lobby](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandar_bin_Sultan).   &gt;""They [Mearsheimer and Walt] should be credited for the courage they have had to actually present a paper [on the Israeli lobby]. I hope they move on and do the Saudi lobby, which is probably more dangerous to the United States than the Israeli lobby."" - Ex-CIA official  They were already halfway to being given the state of Israel by Britain, the holocaust was not the cause of zionism and probably weakened the state of Israel of a few million citizens it would have had. Israel is an insignificant country 0.0001% of the world's land and 0.0005% of the population, the attention it gets is [mostly due to antisemitism like this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saqr_Abu_Fakhr) that has been steady throughout the last 2 milennia and used as a scapegoat for all the problems in the world.  &gt;no one dared to discriminate against them again.  That's blatantly false.   *Antisemitism was commonly used as an instrument for personal conflicts in Soviet Russia, starting from conflict between Joseph Stalin and Leon Trotsky and continuing through numerous conspiracy-theories spread by official propaganda. Antisemitism in the USSR reached new heights after 1948 during the campaign against the ""rootless cosmopolitan"" (euphemism for ""Jew"") in which numerous Yiddish-language poets, writers, painters and sculptors were killed or arrested. This culminated in the so-called Doctors' Plot (1952–1953). Similar antisemitic propaganda in Poland resulted in the flight of Polish Jewish survivors from the country.*  *After the war, the Kielce pogrom and ""March 1968 events"" in communist Poland represented further incidents of antisemitism in Europe. The anti-Jewish violence in postwar Poland has a common theme of blood-libel rumours.*  &gt;A March 2008 report by the U.S. State Department found that there was an increase in antisemitism across the world, and that both old and new expressions of antisemitism persist.  It's really obvious you know little of history so perhaps you should stop speaking about it with such biased assumptions. You don't have to have an opinion on everything and usually it's best to keep quiet on subjects of ignorance or you make yourself look foolish.  ✡✡✡✡✡✡✡✡✡✡✡✡✡",✡

Well then, if we emphasize faith, does this mean that we can forget about the law? Of course not! In fact, only when we have faith do we truly fulfill the law. Abraham was, humanly speaking, the founder of our Jewish nation. What did he discover about being made right with God? If his good deeds had made him acceptable to God, he would have had something to boast about. But that was not God's way. For the Scriptures tell us, ""Abraham believed God, and God counted him as righteous because of his faith."" When people work, their wages are not a gift, but something they have earned.

At the beginning of 1996, when I first got internet access, I switched to DJGPP, which at the time was a build of the infamous gcc 2.95.3. A few years later, I got my hands on a fresh boxed copy of Visual Studio 6 Standard Edition, and have since used every major version of Visual Studio and GCC. When the OpenWatcom compiler sprung into existence I was thrilled, as I recalled all the good will the older dos only Watcom compiler had received. I also pull out the free version of the Intel compiler periodically to see what it makes of my code.  &gt; Do you even know how much effort I invested in understanding error messages that gcc prints out?  I think I'm qualified to know. Your question is kind of my point. It shouldn't be so hard. In my experiments so far clang's output ""Just Makes Sense™"". For each warning, it prints the GCC flag that cause it to be printed. It's a drop in replacement for gcc, you can literally `export CC=""clang""`, without changing a single thing in your existing setup, and it will work as you expect.  It should take some of the pain out of your error reading experience. If not, switching to or from clang for a gcc user takes seconds, if you're a very slow typist.

t5_2cneq,Twiny1,1325557127,"Ron Paul is certifiably insane. This supposed plan is nothing of the sort, it merely throws you and I under the bus in favor of the rich and corporations and does absolutely NOTHING to balance the budget.   It is the very picture of the failure of the conservative world view.  The following is from Justin ""Filthy Liberal Scum"" Rosario with a couple of minor changes for flavor. . .  A fat, smug bastard friend of mine pointed out to me some time ago that pretty much ALL conservative politics are selfish at their core.   Take any conservative position on a social or economic issue and boil away all the right wing bullshit and what you are left with is “I got mine, screw you.”  I had to think about that for a while.  I suppose its simplicity struck me as being a little too easy, a little too sound bitey.  So I sat down and made a list:  No gay marriage – Homosexuality makes me uncomfortable (due to misguided religious influence or poor upbringing or both) so gay people should be punished because of my beliefs.  Stoopid homos…  No welfare, food stamps or Medicaid – I’m not poor enough to qualify for these programs so my tax dollars shouldn’t pay for it.  Stoopid poor people…  No health care reform – Why should I help pay for other people who are sick when I’m not?  Stoopid sick people…  No environmental protection – Environmental laws makes things more expensive for me and that’s bad.  I also don’t understand the concept of long term impact; I want cheap gas and gadgets now!  Stoopid…ah, you get the idea…  Don’t raise my taxes – EVER.  The government can find its own money to pay for stuff.  Medicare – Young conservatives: Why should I help pay for old people and the disabled?     Medicare – Older conservatives: Keep your government hands off my Medicare!  Social Security – Young conservatives: Sacrifices need to be made, people should take care of themselves, not depend on handouts from people like me.    Social Security – Older conservatives: Sacrifices need to be made BUT DON’T YOU TOUCH MY SOCIAL SECURITY!  No abortion – The government should tell women what to do with their bodies because I don’t like abortion. Stoopid pregnant women…  No prayer in school? – GOVERNMENT OVERREACH!!  I like The Jesus™ so everyone should have to listen to my prayers.  No Muslim prayers, though.  That’s indoctrination.  This list goes on for some time.  The more I thought about it, the more obvious it became.  A conservative society is a borderline sociopathic society.  Dictionary.com defines a sociopath as: a person, as a psychopathic personality, whose behavior is antisocial and who lacks a sense of moral responsibility or social conscience.  Conservapedia says a sociopath is “someone with a personality disorder characterized by an antisocial behavior and an absence of moral responsibility or social conscience.” (I would have cited Wikipedia but we all know they’re a liberal front for George Soros, I think I heard that on Glenn Beck)  The key words here are “moral responsibility” and “social conscience”.  Conservative politics lack these essential characteristics.  In their place we find greed, hate, lies, an inability to empathize and an overblown sense of entitlement and self importance.  In other words: all the indicators of a seriously disturbed person.  Except it’s a political philosophy and it has millions of disciples.  But Hey!! You filthy liberal scum, how can you say that?  Well, that’s kind of easy.  Who is the guiding light of conservatives (and Libertarians) all the way from corrupt CEOs down to easily manipulated Tea Party fanatics?  Ayn Rand.  Ayn Rand’s specific worldview was that “The pursuit of his (man’s) own rational self-interest and of his own happiness is the highest moral purpose of his life.”   This is in direct opposition to a functional humane society where the whole must be cohesive in order to provide for its weakest and most vulnerable.  You’ll notice my inclusion of the word “humane”.  You can have a perfectly functional society without a shred of humanity in it.  Take, for example, the Industrial Age societies.  They literally built the foundations for the world we know and yet they allowed or even encouraged child labor; essentially the slavery of children.  Speaking of slavery, they had THAT, too, and no matter what Haley Barbour, Pat Buchanan and the other apologists revisionists would have you think, it was horrible and inhumane.  Ayn Rand’s ideal world is one where society has no say in your actions short of you physically assaulting another person.  “The only function of the government, in such a society, is the task of protecting man’s rights, i.e., the task of protecting him from physical force.”   One is forced to wonder what she would make of Wall Street’s Epic Fail.  Rand was a big champion of no regulation at all.  Close your eyes and imagine what Wall Street could do with even less regulation than it had before.  Think of all the possibilities. Taste the freedom.  Are you done vomiting yet?  Do you know why Rand’s laissez-faire utopia would fail?  It’s the exact same reason a socialist utopia would fail; people are imperfect.  We are greedy, envious, petty and selfish.  There will always be some among us who will better themselves specifically to the detriment of others because they simply don’t care.  There will always be those who, as they gain power and wealth, will want more at any expense.  We saw this in action in communist Russia.  It was rife with the kind of corruption described so very well in George Orwell’s Animal Farm.  Everyone was equal, but some were more equal than others.  We see it today in that bastion of capitalism: America and its budding Oligarchy.  As wealth and power becomes ever more concentrated, the rest of us suffer.  Any attempts to remedy the situation by imposing restrictions on the rich and powerful to keep them from fleecing the country is met with howls of class warfare, Socialism and government overreach.  Any attempts to remove any of the sweetheart deals in place allowing those same anti-government rich and powerful to pay less taxes (or no taxes at all) or to reap billions in unnecessary subsidies are also met with howls of unfair treatment.  Now that’s what I call having your cake and eating it, too.  These people are sociopaths, pure and simple.  As long as they get what they “deserve”, it doesn’t matter what happens to anyone else.  Homeless families are not their problem.  Malnourished children are not their problem.  Uninsured sick people are not their problem.  The elderly reduced to abject poverty (as they were before the advent of Social Security) are not their problem.  Ayn Rand and her delusional rantings provide a rationalization for this immoral behavior.  After the Enron scandal and again after the crash in 2008, CEOs started to reread Atlas Shrugged. “CEOs put the book down knowing in their hearts that they are not the greedy crooks they are portrayed to be in today’s business headlines but are heroes like the characters in Rand’s novel.”  Heroes?  Really?  Is that so?  I would love to walk a group of Wall Street executives out to a Tea Party rally and have them explain to the crowd all the ways these “heroes” have stolen away the TPers money and future.  Then announce that it’s OK because Ayn Rand says self interest and greed are good so whatever these “heroes” do in pursuit of that goal is morally just, even necessary.  I figure the cognitive dissonance would make at least half of the crowd’s heads explode, assuming they have any brains at all, that is.  Mahatma Ghandi said a society is judged by how it treats its most vulnerable.  By this very simple criterion, the conservative sociopathic society would be found wanting and yet the conservative movement claims to be the party of God, family and human decency.  It is none of these things.  It is the party of greed - I've got mine, fuck you.",™

t5_2qhwp,mikbe,1325609839,"One possible mechanism would be participatory economics.   To simplify it for game play:  Councils made up of game citizens decide what they want to consume and how it will be produced. Membership on the councils is widespread with the most productive, the most useful, members of the game having a higher order of precedence for membership in said councils.  Guilds would handle the actual manufacturing of the goods or the doing of the work, e.g. Killing a dragon. The workers in those guilds have a voice in the decisions the guild makes directly proportional to the effect the outcome of the vote would have on them.  For instance everyone in the guild would vote on who is going to lead a raiding party over all but a member of a distinct party would have more influence on who their own leader would than a member of another party.  Currency would not exist, instead each player would have a personal worth or credit based on how much the game society has benefited from their efforts and how difficult or dangerous the work is. For instance someone making bread for 8 hours might not receive as much credit as someone that hunted dangerous creatures for 8 hours. If no one wanted to make bread, if there was a shortage of bread, then the bread making job would become more ""valuable"" until people wanted to do it instead of hunting.  Game citizens can spend their worth on goods and services but they are not allowed to transfer those credits to anyone. They can buy something and trade it for other good or services but there is no transfer of raw credits so there are no banks. Loans would have to be approved by a council of citizens but would be interest free.  I'd call this game EverVote: The Boring Game Where you Vote on Stuff but Never Actually Do Anything!

t5_2ssmu,Hooty_Hoo,1325618268,"*Have you successfully (or unsuccessfully) used one of these programs?*   It is not easy to admit, but I am unsuccessfully in the midst of Starting Strength.  If we lived in a world where I could be a glorious snowflake gentle drifting about a golden field of daffodils, perhaps I could define it as successful on my own terms.   But fuck that.   To put it vaguely, it seems the goal of Starting Strength is to gain strength as quickly as possible with Good Form™.  My form is debatable, and my progress has been very slow.   *What are your favorite resources, spreadsheets, calculators, etc?*  Fitocracy as a lift tracker.  Those yellow stars are great motivators too.   *What tweaks, changes, or extra assistance work have you found to be beneficial to your training on these programs?*   I really wanted to follow the program as closely as possible for as long as I could.  My complete lack of innate athleticism made power-cleans problematic.  At a stupidly low weight, 105 lbs, I started having pain in the front of my shoulder and dropped them.      I also go to the gym every other day instead of 3 days/week.  This was to help buffer against days when I was scheduled to go, but could not due to being sick, the gym being closed, or some sort of family quagmire.    Finally, if my form seems bad, I do not up the weight until I'm satisfied with it.  Frankly, I wonder if this is just a lame excuse to not increase the weight and possibly feel a little more uncomfortable.  I am still trying to find a happy medium between the attaining the Platonic Perfect Form and being the subject of one of those Youtube ""Worst _____ Ever!"" videos.   *Do you have any questions or general comments about these programs?*   I often wonder if Starting Strength is the best program for people like me (Read: Pussies).  On my darker days, I wonder if weightlifting in general is for us.  I mostly try to  banish those negative thoughts, and look at the process as mental strengthening more than anything else.  Due to about 18 months of (literally) crippling sciatica, before I started lifting, I was anxious to pickup anything heaver than 30 lbs.  So even though my lifts are shit, I do maintain hope that as long as I am consistent and authentically try to keep adding more weight to the bar, weights that seem scary to me now, will be a part of my routine in a few months.

Now let's suppose that I say that ""John Doe is a banker, a gay rights activist, a fan of *The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya*, and an Al Hibber fan."" Is the first or latter more likely to be true?  Now, let's suppose that Conservative Canadian Christianity™ is true. How many rules are there in the defined doctrine, hierarchy, and written organization of Conservative Canadian Christianity™? 1,000? 10,000? Now, let's make the very reasonable assumption that animists assume at least one spirit per wooden plant. How many wooden plants have there been in the history of Earth? A billion, a trillion?  So is assuming the hierarchy, existence, and complexity of 10,000 rules and one very powerful God over the complexity of a trillion+ completely independent (with roughly the same complexity as a modern human soul, if traditional animist religions are true) more or less rational?  Let's supposed you still managed to say ""No, the latter is better."" Consider the fact that Conservative Canadian Christianity™ is static; God is, and it's widely accepted that there aren't going to be any more rules beyond the Bible. On the other hand, the number of wooden living things that have existed, and thus wood spirits, is constantly increasing.  So even if Conservative Canadian Christianity™ is more complex than wood spiritism, it won't be for long.",™

t5_2sokd,eriad19,1325660423,"You're in school. It's recess time. You're a 4th grade kid who runs around at recess. There are other kids like you running around and playing games and having all kinds of mayhem.  That boy over there has a Gameboy. Those girls are playing Hopscotch. This kid is playing with a Furby. That other group of kids is playing Cops and Robbers. You and your friends are playing tag.  One day, a kid shows up with something new. He brings with him Pokemon cards. His friends come up to him. They ask him what those shiny cards are. The Pokemon kid shows them. His friends are blown away. From now on, you seem them in that same corner playing Pokemon cards during recess.  The next day, other kids come over to see what the fuss is all about. They see this exciting new Pokemon game and they're all fans now. The Pokemon kid who first brought in the cards is a hit. He's the center of attention and everyone wants to ask him what the rules are. He's getting popular. The Pokemon kid is the heart of the group, and he no longer even has to welcome other kids into the group - his new fans from the previous day do that for him.  The next day during recess, the Pokemon gang, now a huge group, is taking a huge turf. A kid shows up on the other end of the field. He has something new. They're Digimon cards. A few people come up to him. He shows them what these Digimon cards are. He shows them how to play. It has its own little quirks. Its own style. Some kids scoff and head to the Pokemon side. Some kids are blown away and become Digimon freaks. They are now part of the group of kids who plays Digimon.  (And some kids just weren't able to decide between the Pokemon group and the Digimon group, and so they go back and forth)  There is now the Pokemon group. There is now the Digimon group. Some of the Pokemon group switched to the Digimon side. Some of the Digimon side switched to the Pokemon side. The diehard Pokemon fanatics run around the entire playground though, trying to bring new kids into their group. The Digimon diehard fanatics run around trying to bring new kids to play in their group.  One kid shows up, says fuck you all, and whips out a motherfucking Yo-Yo.  This kid with the motherfucking light-up glow-in-the-dark Yo-Yo walks around the playground. The motherfucking Yo-Yo is swinging around. The motherfucking Yo-Yo is sliding on the ground. The motherfucking light-up glow-in-the-dark Yo-Yo is awesome. It's unlike anything else there.  Several kids run up. They want to try the motherfucking Yo-Yo. They ooh and aah, and are blown away. Each one goes up there. They like what they see. They're hooked. They become the Motherfucking Yo-Yo Brigade™.  The Motherfucking Yo-Yo Brigade™ has its fans now running around the playground. They want to get other kids to see the motherfucking Yo-Yo. They get many, many kids come over. Many kids try it out. They like what they see.  Some of those kids were from the Pokemon group. Some of those kids were from the Digimon group. Some of those kids were ones that never had a group.  The whole time, you have been trying to start a group based around playing Tag.  You love tag. You adore tag. You've played tag everyday of your life. But, your friends who you used to play tag with are gone. Tony went to the Pokemon group. David and Eric went to the Digimon group. Henry joined the Motherfucking Yo-Yo Brigade™. Other friends went back and forth. The gang is gone, all of them are gone, all of them except you and your best friend Mike.  You and Mike realize that you are never going to have a group based on Tag. The Pokemon group is too large. The Digimon group is too loud. The Motherfucking Yo-Yo Brigade™ is too cool. And so, reluctantly, achingly, you and Mike decide that it's not worth staying around playing tag with so few people. You turn to Mike and ask him what he thinks:  ""Mike, what do you think we sh-"" Out of the corner of your eye, you see Mike in the Motherfucking Yo-Yo Brigade™ swinging a Yo-Yo around and walking the dog.  Your world comes crashing down. You know the inevitable has come. You are now alone, you and your once loyal base of Tag players. It's just you now, with the Pokemon and the Digimon and the Motherfucking Yo-Yo Brigade™ taking up the entire playground. There's no room left for you. Nothing left for you.  And so, achingly, you shuffle your feet, head down, and slowly head to the other side of the playground, to lay to rest your hopes of playing Tag and putting your dreams to rest.  ---  The original kids who brought in the Pokemon cards, the Digimon cards, and the Yo-Yo are the candidates.  The other kids who are in the Pokemon group and the Digimon group and the Motherfucking Yo-Yo Brigade™ are the voters.  The growing base of each candidate shows how they attract attention to their campaigns.  The rules of each respective game (Pokemon, Digimon, the Yo-Yo) are the platform of each candidate.  The interchange of kids going from the Pokemon to the Digimon to the Yo-Yo groups represent undecided voters who ""cast their votes"" for the party.  You represent a small, weak, third-tier candidate, Tag, who never had a chance against the big money and the powerful Pokemon and Digimon and Motherfucking Yo-Yo Brigade™ groups. The caucuses narrow down the field, as we saw tonight, to just a few candidates, just like the playground.",™

t5_2s4uu,kindofstephen,1325713533," **Cetaphil Daily Facial Moisturizer SPF 15**  **The Claim**  A facial moisturizer plus moderate sun protection, all in one.  Cetaphil® Daily Facial Moisturizer SPF 15 is specially formulated to be effective, light and silky-smooth — ideal for facial use. In addition to providing gentle moisturization for all skin types, Cetaphil® Daily Facial Moisturizer SPF 15 gives you moderate protection against damaging UVA and UVB rays that are responsible for premature lines and wrinkles. This skin moisturizer is lightweight, fragrance-free and suitable for use under makeup or after shaving.  **The Ingredients**  Active ingredients: avobenzone 3%, octocrylene 10%  Water, diisopropyl adipate, cyclomethicone, glycerin, glyceryl stearate, PEG-100 stearate, polymethyl methacrylate, phenoxyethanol, benzyl alcohol, acrylates/C10-30 alkyl acrylate crosspolymer, tocopheryl acetate, carbomer 940, disodium EDTA, triethanolamine.  (Listed in decreasing quantity)  **The Cost**  $2.64 US per fluid ounce on Amazon  **What is it?**  Cetaphil Daily Facial Moisturizer SPF 15, is a moisturizer with a texture designed for the face with chemical sunscreens and an antioxidant – making it a day time moisturizer.  Avobenzone and Octocrylene are chemical sunscreens. Avobenzone is a UVA sunscreen, unfortunately in the presence of UV light avobenzone can degrade and release free radicals in the skin. The addition of Octocrylene, however, can stabilize and prevent avobenzone from degrading. Octocrylene on its own is a UVB  sunscreen, however it can penetrate the skin and release free radicals.  Diisopropyl adipate acts as a solvent and moisturizer.  Cyclomethicone and Polymethyl methacrylate act as emollients. Cyclomethicone, which is a silicone, will smooth the skin and provide that soft, velvety texture to the skin. Polymethyl methacrylate is an acrylic polymer, it helps the product apply more smoothly and feel smoother – like the cyclomethicone.  Glycerin acts as a humectant. As a hygroscopic ingredient, glycerin can attract moisture from the atmosphere and bind it in to the skin. Over time glycerin will increase the moisture in the skin. While it is water soluble, high concentrations of glycerin in products can make it sticky and leave your skin shiny.  Glyceryl stearate, PEG-100 stearate,  acrylates/C10-30 alkyl acrylate crosspolymer and carbomer 940 act as thickeners. These ingredients are responsible for the thickeness and texture of the product. Glyceryl stearate and Peg-100 stearate also do double duty as emulsifiers – they keep oil ingredients like Avobenzone and Octocrylene from seperating from the water.  Phenoxyethanol and Benzyl alcohol act as preservatives reducing or stopping the growth of bacteria and fungi.  Tocopheryl acetate or Vitamin E acts as an antioxidant. Vitamin E is an oil soluble antioxidant and will reduce free radical damage caused by UV exposure. However Tocerphyl Acetate is an inactive version of Vitamin E, a study showed that it did not provide immediate antioxidant activity in the skin, but over a period of 5 days it increased levels of active Vitamin E in rat skin about 5%.  Disodium EDTA acts as a chelator. Chelators bind to metal ions which can be present in water. These metal ions can encourage bacteria growth, and they can also react negatively with certain ingredients such as Avobenzone. Avobenzone can bind with iron ions and stain clothing.  Triethanolamine is an alkaline pH modifier. Triethanolamine also functions as a surfactant/emulsifier, but since its the last ingredient it’s likely at very low levels, possibly a 1/10th of a percent which makes its use as a pH modifier more likely.  **The Match Up**  “A facial moisturizer plus moderate sun protection, all in one.” Yup! Cetaphil Daily moisturizer contains emollients like silicone which will instantly make your skin feel smoother, and moisturizers like glycerin which will over time bring moisture to the skin and the sunsreens avobenzone and octocrylene for UVA/UVB protection.  “…effective, light and silky-smooth” Yup! By changing the percentage of thickeners used, a chemist can make a product thicker or lighter. A thicker product doesn’t mean it’s more moisturizing though, even though it may feel that way. The silky smoothness from this product is from the Cyclomethicone and Polymethyl methacrylate  “…gentle moisturization for all skin types” Yup! Glycerin is a great moisturizer for people with dry skin, and oily skin as it is water soluble. A small percentage of people may find that they are allergic to it, but it is quite prevalent in moisturizers.  “…moderate protection against damaging UVA and UVB rays that are responsible for premature lines and wrinkles” Uhh. With Avobenzone covering the UVA spectrum (320 to 400 nm) and Octocrylene covering the UVB spectrum (250 to 320 nm), Cetaphil Daily Moisturizer does provide full spectrum protection. However both of these ingredients are not as effective in the middle of the spectrum around 320 nm. There is also the issue of Avobenzone and Octocrylene releasing free radicals in the skin, which can damage to the skin’s cells. The product does include Tocopherol Acetate, which acts as an antioxidant, but the activity of Tocopherol Acetate may not be strong enough to counteract the free radicals generated from the sunscreens. Better antioxidants to have included would have been green tea extract (ECGC), or even lycopene – which is deposited by the body in to the skin to provide UV protection.  “…fragrance-free” Yup! No fragrance in here.  “…suitable for use under makeup or after shaving.” Yup! The cyclomethicone might actually make your makeup application smoother by acting as a primer. And for freshly shaved skin, glycerin can sometimes cause stinging, but will help return moisture to the skin.  **The Verdict: Match!**  Cetaphil Daily Facial Moisturizer SPF 15 is a good moisturizer for someone who doesn’t have many skin issues. It does provide moderate UV protection, and is broad spectrum – though there are better choices out there. The chemical nature of the sunscreens means that it can generate free radicals in UV light, and the one antioxidant in the product may not be enough to counteract them.  The main moisturizing ingredient in the product is glycerin, which is widely used and very cheaply acquired. The cyclomethicone and  Polymethyl methacrylate give your skin a smoother feel, but won’t do much in terms of long term improvement of the skin.  If you’re looking for something very basic, non-oily and not likely to cause acne, that only provides moisturizing benefits to the skin, with some SPF for daily use, this product will do that. It would be best to layer an antioxidant rich product, such as a gel or liquid, under this moisturizer. ",®

t5_2rww2,kindofstephen,1325730785," **Cetaphil Daily Facial Moisturizer SPF 15**  **The Claim**  A facial moisturizer plus moderate sun protection, all in one.  Cetaphil® Daily Facial Moisturizer SPF 15 is specially formulated to be effective, light and silky-smooth — ideal for facial use. In addition to providing gentle moisturization for all skin types, Cetaphil® Daily Facial Moisturizer SPF 15 gives you moderate protection against damaging UVA and UVB rays that are responsible for premature lines and wrinkles. This skin moisturizer is lightweight, fragrance-free and suitable for use under makeup or after shaving.  **The Ingredients**  Active ingredients: avobenzone 3%, octocrylene 10%  Water, diisopropyl adipate, cyclomethicone, glycerin, glyceryl stearate, PEG-100 stearate, polymethyl methacrylate, phenoxyethanol, benzyl alcohol, acrylates/C10-30 alkyl acrylate crosspolymer, tocopheryl acetate, carbomer 940, disodium EDTA, triethanolamine.  (Listed in decreasing quantity)  **The Cost**  $2.64 US per fluid ounce on Amazon  **What is it?**  Cetaphil Daily Facial Moisturizer SPF 15, is a moisturizer with a texture designed for the face with chemical sunscreens and an antioxidant – making it a day time moisturizer.  Avobenzone and Octocrylene are chemical sunscreens. Avobenzone is a UVA sunscreen, unfortunately in the presence of UV light avobenzone can degrade and release free radicals in the skin. The addition of Octocrylene, however, can stabilize and prevent avobenzone from degrading. Octocrylene on its own is a UVB  sunscreen, however it can penetrate the skin and release free radicals.  Diisopropyl adipate acts as a solvent and moisturizer.  Cyclomethicone and Polymethyl methacrylate act as emollients. Cyclomethicone, which is a silicone, will smooth the skin and provide that soft, velvety texture to the skin. Polymethyl methacrylate is an acrylic polymer, it helps the product apply more smoothly and feel smoother – like the cyclomethicone.  Glycerin acts as a humectant. As a hygroscopic ingredient, glycerin can attract moisture from the atmosphere and bind it in to the skin. Over time glycerin will increase the moisture in the skin. While it is water soluble, high concentrations of glycerin in products can make it sticky and leave your skin shiny.  Glyceryl stearate, PEG-100 stearate,  acrylates/C10-30 alkyl acrylate crosspolymer and carbomer 940 act as thickeners. These ingredients are responsible for the thickeness and texture of the product. Glyceryl stearate and Peg-100 stearate also do double duty as emulsifiers – they keep oil ingredients like Avobenzone and Octocrylene from seperating from the water.  Phenoxyethanol and Benzyl alcohol act as preservatives reducing or stopping the growth of bacteria and fungi.  Tocopheryl acetate or Vitamin E acts as an antioxidant. Vitamin E is an oil soluble antioxidant and will reduce free radical damage caused by UV exposure. However Tocerphyl Acetate is an inactive version of Vitamin E, a study showed that it did not provide immediate antioxidant activity in the skin, but over a period of 5 days it increased levels of active Vitamin E in rat skin about 5%.  Disodium EDTA acts as a chelator. Chelators bind to metal ions which can be present in water. These metal ions can encourage bacteria growth, and they can also react negatively with certain ingredients such as Avobenzone. Avobenzone can bind with iron ions and stain clothing.  Triethanolamine is an alkaline pH modifier. Triethanolamine also functions as a surfactant/emulsifier, but since its the last ingredient it’s likely at very low levels, possibly a 1/10th of a percent which makes its use as a pH modifier more likely.  **The Match Up**  “A facial moisturizer plus moderate sun protection, all in one.” Yup! Cetaphil Daily moisturizer contains emollients like silicone which will instantly make your skin feel smoother, and moisturizers like glycerin which will over time bring moisture to the skin and the sunsreens avobenzone and octocrylene for UVA/UVB protection.  “…effective, light and silky-smooth” Yup! By changing the percentage of thickeners used, a chemist can make a product thicker or lighter. A thicker product doesn’t mean it’s more moisturizing though, even though it may feel that way. The silky smoothness from this product is from the Cyclomethicone and Polymethyl methacrylate  “…gentle moisturization for all skin types” Yup! Glycerin is a great moisturizer for people with dry skin, and oily skin as it is water soluble. A small percentage of people may find that they are allergic to it, but it is quite prevalent in moisturizers.  “…moderate protection against damaging UVA and UVB rays that are responsible for premature lines and wrinkles” Uhh. With Avobenzone covering the UVA spectrum (320 to 400 nm) and Octocrylene covering the UVB spectrum (250 to 320 nm), Cetaphil Daily Moisturizer does provide full spectrum protection. However both of these ingredients are not as effective in the middle of the spectrum around 320 nm. There is also the issue of Avobenzone and Octocrylene releasing free radicals in the skin, which can damage to the skin’s cells. The product does include Tocopherol Acetate, which acts as an antioxidant, but the activity of Tocopherol Acetate may not be strong enough to counteract the free radicals generated from the sunscreens. Better antioxidants to have included would have been green tea extract (ECGC), or even lycopene – which is deposited by the body in to the skin to provide UV protection.  “…fragrance-free” Yup! No fragrance in here.  “…suitable for use under makeup or after shaving.” Yup! The cyclomethicone might actually make your makeup application smoother by acting as a primer. And for freshly shaved skin, glycerin can sometimes cause stinging, but will help return moisture to the skin.  **The Verdict: Match!**  Cetaphil Daily Facial Moisturizer SPF 15 is a good moisturizer for someone who doesn’t have many skin issues. It does provide moderate UV protection, and is broad spectrum – though there are better choices out there. The chemical nature of the sunscreens means that it can generate free radicals in UV light, and the one antioxidant in the product may not be enough to counteract them.  The main moisturizing ingredient in the product is glycerin, which is widely used and very cheaply acquired. The cyclomethicone and  Polymethyl methacrylate give your skin a smoother feel, but won’t do much in terms of long term improvement of the skin.  If you’re looking for something very basic, non-oily and not likely to cause acne, that only provides moisturizing benefits to the skin, with some SPF for daily use, this product will do that. It would be best to layer an antioxidant rich product, such as a gel or liquid, under this moisturizer. ",®
t5_2qh1e,Saph,1325732336,"I'll copy/paste something I saw on the escapist a while ago which seems relevant to the video as well, an argument as to ""being nice"" doesn't equal ""deserving the girl"". If only I'd read it during puberty -.-  ""In this world, there are nice guys and Nice Guys™. The nice guys are genuine, honest, likable people: Men of generosity, of kindness, who treat those around them with respect. Nice Guys™, on the other hand, are passive-aggressive babies who feel entitled to a woman's affections simply because they've ""been there for her""*.  A nice guy sees a woman as an individual with the capacity to make her own choices, even ones he may or may not agree with. He does not begrudge anyone her self-determination.  A Nice Guy™, on the other hand, sees a woman as an Achievement to unlock. He thinks that as long as he mashes the right sequence of buttons (Listen to her problems! Give her presents! Cheer her up when she's sad!), then he's entitled to collect his just reward-and if he doesn't get it, then he'll whine about what he perceives as bugs in the game. What a woman wants or chooses makes no nevermind to a Nice Guy™, because should she have the gumption to actually want something different than what he wants, then clearly, she's only trying to torture or take advantage of him.  A nice guy likes you for who you are. A Nice Guy™ likes you for what he thinks you represent, or what he wants you to be.  A nice guy complains that the pretty girl who he asked out didn't say yes. A Nice Guy™ complains that the pretty girl who is the love of his life and he'll never meet anyone else like her again, who he didn't ask out but just pretended to listen when she talked about her problems for three hours because he was too chicken-shit to ask her out didn't say let me completely validate your existence for you and by the way why hasn't anyone ever realized what a Nice Guy™ you are?""",™

The screen is mounted on the arm of the wheel chair where I can see it, more recent systems have the whole computer in a box on this arm. The original systems were put together for me by David Mason, of Cambridge Adaptive Communications.

A cursor moves across the upper part of the screen. I can stop it by pressing a switch in my hand. This switch is my only interface with the computer. In this way I can select words, which are printed on the lower part of the screen. When I have built up a sentence, I can send it to a speech synthesizer. I use a separate synthesizer, made by Speech+. It is the best I have heard, though it gives me an accent that has been described variously as Scandinavian, American or Scottish. I also can use Windows 98 through an interface called EZ Keys, again made by Words Plus. I am able to control the mouse with the switch through cleverly selected process from a small box shown on the desktop. I can also write text using similar menu's to those in Equalizer.  &gt;I can save what I write to disk. I write papers using a formatting program called TEX. I can write equations in words, and the program translates them into symbols, and prints them out on paper in the appropriate type. I can also give lectures. I write the lecture beforehand, and save it on disk. I can then send it to the speech synthesiser, a sentence at a time. It works quite well, and I can try out the lecture, and polish it, before I give it.   ELI5: computer built into wheelchair, controlled with a switch",™

IF you wish to make the unmodified version of each weapon the best for balance across recoil, accuracy and stealth (I'm not saying I agree this is a good idea, players do have to work to unlock them after all), then logically every attachment MUST have a downside as well as a benefit.  Any attachment which is purely beneficial will render the unmodified weapon inferior overall.  The downsides (and sometimes benefits) of a given attachment in real life obviously cannot always be accurately represented in the game (weight of the weapon, cumbersome long barrels in tight spaces etc) so it's not unreasonable that, in the name of balance, these downsides be represented in another way as close as possible to reality within the confines of the game-play.  Again, my observations are made on the assumption that an unmodified weapon play the role of balanced jack-of-all-trades.  Suppressors:   As I understand it, in reality suppressors are rarely used in open combat because (a) they have limited benefit when using supersonic rounds and (b) they make the weapon slightly longer and more cumbersome.  Using subsonic rounds will have implications for the range and penetration of your weapon, but you will be silent.  I love the way stealth is represented in game via the effects on the minimap and audio, and it feels to me like the downside of subsonic ammunition can be represented well with penalties to range and/or power at range (although I wouldn’t like to put a figure on by how much myself).  I'm not sure why accuracy comes into the equation really, unless it is designed to represent the extra weight on the muzzle?  Seems unnecessary.  Foregrip:   Again, as I understand it, in reality use of a foregrip is largely down to personal preference.  A large number of people claim their accuracy in some circumstances is increased and the weapon more comfortable to handle.  Others dislike it and claim it is a clumsy addition when prone, it is however generally acknowledged to be a benefit.  Increasing unaimed accuracy seems a great way of representing the improved handling of the weapon, the issue is picking a suitable in-game downside to what is essentially a good thing!  The idea that using a foregrip prevents the use of auxiliary weapons like the M320 is, I think, an excellent one, although whether or not this is a sufficient downside I do not know.  The idea of penalizing aimed accuracy is a logical counterpart to the increased unaimed accuracy, but probably has little basis in reality.  Bipod:  Honestly I have little experience with this attachment.  The few times I have used it my experience has reflected the numerous comments on here about it being too much of a pain to deploy.  The benefits are I’m sure excellent, but the deployment issue kills it for me.  Could it not automatically give benefit when prone?  Flash suppressor:  As has been mentioned several times, in reality this is pretty much standard on most weapons.  If it must be included in as an upgrade (which I have nothing against really) then perhaps making it an early upgrade with relatively little effect on performance outside of reduced visual signature.   Heavy barrel:  I agree, the existing recoil penalty seems harsh, your suggested amendments sound good.  Laser and tac light:  Generally great as they are, although the tac light perhaps a bit too effective on broad daylight  ☺  Again, many thanks for this.  There must be a thousand other things you have to take into account that we never even think about.  So it’s great to see someone so committed to listening to the players. ",☺

That idea became a company called POWER BALANCE™, the creators of the Power Balance™ silicone wristband.   Five years and millions of wristbands later, Power Balance™ and founders, Troy and Josh Rodarmel have single-handedly defined the “Performance Technology” category and redefined the sports accessories market. From thousands of professional athletes to millions of aspiring amateurs, weekend warriors and active consumers, Power Balance™ has become a brand as powerful as the athletes who wear its products. Born in concept from ancient health and wellness practices and wrapped in a modern holographic form, Power Balance™ stands out among its many imitators as “The Original” sports performance wristband.

t5_2qh1i,Chronophilia,1325888670,"&gt;As I said that's irrelevant, you believe in Skynet. Your religion is Terminator II (™)  The politically correct term is ""Singularitarian"", thankyouverymuch.  &gt;Why do you need to introduce a deity?  Because the Internet has no reason of its own to write poetry. Humans do; the forces of evolution compel us to make more humans, and if writing poetry will get someone laid, they will write poetry. Computers don't want to get laid, so they need to be programmed to write poetry.  I was just picking holes in your metaphor, there's no need for a deity.  &gt;So Life (you overlooked the capital L) doesn't exist, on that we agree.  If you say so. I'm not entirely sure what you mean by that (but see below).  &gt;generally speaking physical systems tend to degrade with time  &gt;Life on Earth has stubbornly been striving towards the ""upward"" direction  This is correct. I would argue that the Universe as a whole is degrading over time, but not everywhere at the same rate. If a living entity were put in a closed system, with no outside source of energy (namely, the Sun, and other living things that ultimately take their energy from the Sun), it would not survive for long. The only reason living things can create order from their surroundings is that disorder is being created elsewhere to fuel them. Overall, the Universe tends towards disorder.  &gt;""nihilism"", i.e., basically maintaining that nothing exists  That would be ""metaphysical nihilism"", and a rather extreme form of that. Or possibly ""solipsism"". My views are closer to ""existential nihilism"", namely, there is no greater meaning or purpose to life except what we make ourselves. Of course I believe things exist; how could I be typing this post on a non-existent keyboard?  What I meant to say by ""everything decays eventually"" is that in a few thousand years, I will be gone and everything I ever created will be dust. This was meant to be a counter-example to your assertion that ""some things seem to flourish while others decay"": in fact, everything decays, given enough time. It also explains my belief that my life has no greater purpose.  I also believe that physical reality is all that we can or should know about; there are no such thing as gods, or souls, or supernatural life force, and even if there are they're not important to us. (If this is what you meant by Life-with-a-capital-L, then we are agreed.)  And yes, emotions are merely chemicals in the mammalian brain; but if you think that makes them any less special to me then you are deeply mistaken.  I've enjoyed this discussion. Please don't insult me by calling my fondly held opinions ""laughable bullshit""; by your own admission, you don't know what they are. I'm pretty sure we're both actually agreeing on all the important points, we just phrase things in different ways.",™

t5_2qxih,FrankReynolds,1325895388,"Hello everyone! We are excited to announce that today’s patch for our Public Test Server brings you the first of many content updates for Star Wars™: The Old Republic™. It includes some exciting content additions, including a new Flashpoint, Kaon Under Siege, and four new boss additions to Operation: Karagga’s Palace. You’ll also notice changes to Open World PvP on Ilum.  As with every update, 1.1 includes many high-priority bug fixes. We have corrected the issue that prevented some Jedi Knights from progressing in Kira Carsen’s affection conversations, made some previously inaccessible Datacrons reachable, and have made many fixes to various issues in Flashpoints and Operations.  We are looking forward to your feedback about the changes we have made, and we appreciate you using the Public Test Server forums to report any bugs you encounter while playing on it. Thank you for playing Star Wars: The Old Republic!   Note: The Public Test Server patch notes will be provided in English. The final release notes will be provided in English, French, and German when the content is moved to live servers.    ###Star Wars: The Old Republic - Game Update 1.1 P  ***  ##General  * Anti-aliasing is now available and can be enabled in the preferences menu.  ##Classes and Combat  General  * Healing caused by crowd control abilities no longer generates threat. Tooltips for abilities modified by skill points now display correct damage values.  * Guard -  This ability now transfers to a new friendly target without requiring deactivation on the previous target. Activating this ability while targeting a guarded or invalid target will still toggle the Guard ability off. A distinct visual effect is now present on characters using Guard on another character, and another effect is now present on the guarded character if they leave Guard’s range.  * Taunt - A new visual effect has been added to the user and the target of the Taunt ability for the duration of its effect.  ###Jedi Consular  * Project: This ability no longer shakes the screen of onlookers.  ##Shadow  * Battle Readiness: Now allows Combat Technique to trigger once every 3 seconds.  * Combat Technique: Healing received through Combat Technique has been increased, scales properly at higher levels, and can only be triggered once every 4.5 seconds.  * Slow Time: This ability’s damage has been increased by 15% and it now slows the movement speed of all affected targets.  ###Jedi Knight  * Force Leap: This ability no longer functions on Portable Holo Dancers.   ###Sith Inquisitor   ##Assassin   * Dark Charge: Healing received through Dark Charge has been increased, scales properly at higher levels, and can only be triggered once every 4.5 seconds.  * Overcharge Saber: Now allows Dark Charge to trigger once every 3 seconds. Wither: Damage has been increased by 15% and it now slows the movement speed of all affected targets.  ###Sith Warrior  * Intercede: This ability no longer functions on Portable Holo Dancers. Shatter: this ability’s tooltip now correctly reflects its damage; damage from this ability has not been adjusted.   ###Imperial Agent  ##Bug Fixes  * Corrected an issue where activating cover, using Explosive Probe, and then using Snipe could cause Snipe to be interrupted.  ###Bounty Hunter  ##General  * Incendiary Missile: This ability is no longer misclassified as an Area of Effect ability.  ###Companion Characters   ##General  * C2-N2 and 2V-R8 no longer vocalize crafting commentary during combat. The Carbonized Stream companion ability no longer breaks prematurely.  ###Companions  ##Kira Carsen  * Fixed an issue that caused players to be unable to progress in Kira’s affection conversations. Players previously affected by this issue can now speak to Kira and progress normally.  ##Bug Fixes  * Companions will now sell trash items when requested, regardless of group size.  * Companion healing abilities no longer apply a permanent green effect on the character. Fixed an issue that caused Companion Characters to sometimes have the incorrect appearance in cinematics.  ###Crew Skills  ##Bug Fixes  * Corrected an issue that prevented recently completed Crew Skill missions from showing up in the next list of available missions.  * Fixed a bug that could cause Crew Skills a character didn’t have to appear in the Crew Skills window. Players can no longer loot harvesting nodes they do not have the appropriate Crew Skill for after a group member harvests (but does not loot) a node.  ###Flashpoints and Operations   ##General  * A new level 50 Flashpoint, Kaon Under Siege, is now available for play in Normal and Hard Modes!  * The Gav Daragon and the Ziost Shadow have been expanded to accommodate the Kaon Under Siege gateway.  * The difficulty of some non-boss enemies in Flashpoints has been adjusted.  * Enemies now drop credits more frequently in Flashpoints.  ##Flashpoints  #Cademimu  * General Ortol’s rocket fire damage no longer occurs when the rocket is not active.  # The Black Talon  * Some enemies in this Flashpoint are no longer invisible.  # The Foundry  * Corrected an issue that could cause the final boss to become stuck at 10% health.  #The Battle of Ilum  * Krel Thak’s Allied Weequay Pirates have had their toughness reduced in Hard Mode.  #The False Emperor  * The Sith Entity’s affliction ability now properly deals damage in Hard Mode.  * HK-47 now has the correct amount of health in Normal Mode.  ##Operations  *Eternity Vault  * Players are now able to successfully loot the chest after defeating the Infernal Council.  * Perimeter Defense Cannons have been re-tuned and have improved targeting behaviors.  * Soa’s Mind Trap and Force Throw abilities no longer target the same player multiple times; they now target every player in the group once.  * Ball lightning enemies summoned by Soa deal damage in a smaller radius.  * The Annihilation Droid’s rocket burst attack no longer deals double damage in 16-player Operations.  * Soa now summons fewer ball lightning enemies during the final round in 16-player Operations.  #Karagga’s Palace  * Four new bosses can now be battled by players in Karagga’s Palace!  * Players no longer get stuck attempting to exit the Karagga’s Palace phase.  ##Bug Fixes  #Flashpoints  * Corrected an issue that prevented some enemy NPCs from spawning in Flashpoints.  * The correct error message now displays when a player attempts to enter a different Flashpoint than the rest of the group.  * Flashpoint gateways no longer display as orange in incorrect circumstances.  * Fixed an issue that prevented Flashpoint difficulty from being set properly.  * Fixed an issue that caused mapnotes directing players to some Flashpoints to not appear correctly.  * Corrected map issues that made locating mission objectives on the Gav Daragon difficult.  * Fixed an issue preventing some players from opening a chest after a boss fight if the group was previously defeated by the boss.   tional collision.",™

I mean, when I saw the pilot episode I thought it was better than the movie so it's possible we just have different personal calibrations for what awesome is. :P   After the pilot they kind of settled into the First Season Blues™ that most shows seem to go through as they try to find their footing and figure out what they're about. It was very ""every planet is an offshoot of some ancient Earth culture"" which actually I enjoyed just fine but was starting to wonder if that's all it was ever going to be.  Then they started one storyline and me and my girlfriend were like *""Holy shit, they just turned it up to 11,""* and then it just stayed there. One of the things I love is that even when they have little one-off episodes, it'll almost always come back to play a part in something else down the line, even if it's a season or two later. So cool.  If you're expecting the hyperrealism and painful human drama of something like Battlestar Galactica (which I also love) you may not care for it. It's definitely a more pulpy, fun and dare I say traditional sci-fi show, but I personally think it hits a perfect sweet spot of neat ideas, great cast and action.  If you can hack it, I'd say give it till the end of the first season at least. And 2nd &amp; 3rd seasons, after they get a few budget bumps, things like effects/props/costumes start getting better as well. Anyone else wanna back me up (or tear me down)?",™

The drug war™ is not about drugs, but about punishing niggers, beaners and kids so they don’t vote democrat.  Since the drug war is working overtime to put away those people, it insures that republicans votes will be greater than democrat votes.  Nixon understood that 40 years ago, and that’s why he set forth the drug war, because anti-war people were also pot smokers, and putting them away for smoking pot also prevented them from protesting against the war.",™

t5_2t857,blackmoon918,1325910191,"I'm don't think Whedon's work is a fantastic portrayal of feminism, but I think that alot of his work does a damn sight better than alot of other programming. That said, I found some things in this article troublesome:  &gt;Let’s consider that she, as a Slayer, descends from a line that was literally created by men – a formation that stems directly from the male anxiety over an inability to create life the way that women do. And inherently problematic is the idea of the Watcher, a predominantly male presence that is the male gaze made manifest – a source of constant looking that is an explicit form of control.  But this doesn't tell the whole story. Giles eventually leaves Buffy, as he recognises that she needs to grow, and his presence is stifling her. When he returns a season later, Buffy HAS grown the way Giles wanted her to, and although it makes him uncomfortable that he's no longer a teacher/father figure to Buffy, Buffy makes it clear that she no longer needs a watcher, that she is the one in charge, making the decisions.  Buffy and Willow later prepare to cast a spell that would awaken the line of Slayers, and with the Watcher's Council no longer active, the women take the male-controlling Slayer system and make it into their own, new, better system.  The rest of this article on BtVS doesn't seem well backed up at all, simply stating things like ""The strong female characters are sublimated to the weaker, childish males’ needs – and Xander is the worst perpetrator of them all."" and this paragraph  &gt;Of course, after she breaks up with him, he plans to take her by force – in “”Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered,” Xander casts a spell to make Cordelia fall in love with him. The fact that it backfires doesn’t make this episode any less horrifying, since every woman in town begins to throw herself at Xander – which is the fantasy of every Nice Guy ™ that ever walked the planet.  completely ignores the fact that this was shown to be a pretty horrible thing to do.  I don't want to suggest that everything Whedon has written is a perfect, shining example of feminism, because it's not. There are problematic parts of his programs, (Firefly: Episode 11 was severely disappointing for me because of this), but these tend to be on a much smaller scale - a single episode, not an entire plotline. He writes some cool things, and generally tries to make his female characters independent and strong. What he writes is alot better than some of the other programs, both at the time, and currently.",™

t5_2qxpm,katherine_bradford,1325913099,"When I moved back when I was in the fifth grade, I met a wonderful girl at my new school. She and I sat next to each other every school day until the day we graduated. We lost contact for many years after graduation as we each grew in our own ways.. but I have never forgotten her. When I had my breakdown a few years ago, I reached out to her and like every time I have asked for help.. and she did not hesitate. She talked me down from some scary places (I know because I have saved every chat log from those times to help remember why I transitioned) and for that I am forever grateful (and I tell her that as often as I can).

t5_2qh1i,Avenkal19,1325940362,"According to the acgih (acgih means American Conference of Industrial Hygienists) below are the guidance's on static magnetic fields  But the main numbers you will want to look at is the 5 G (0.5mT) which is for people who have pacemakers and other medical implants. Another one you want to look at is the 600 G (60mT) which is the legal limit of gauss that someone is allowed to be exposed to in an 8hr day. But after those points you start to get into the range of shits flying around the room.  But yeah your mom will on and average day not come into contact with any of these unless she is working in a industrial area or a lab.  Also you could just not tell here that you turned it off one night so that when she says it prevents her from sleeping that its really not.   ACGIH threshold limit values for continuous exposure to static magnetic fields Abbreviations used in this table: G – Gauss; a unit of magnetic field intensity, equal to 0.0001 Tesla mT – millitesla T – Tesla; magnetic field strength is measured in Tesla TWA – time weighted average  Note: 1 Gauss (G) = 0.1 millitesla (mT) 5 G (0.5mT)	Highest allowed field for implanted cardiac pacemakers 10G (1.0mT)	Damage to watches, credit cards, magnetic tape, and computer disks 30G (3.0mT)	Kinetic energy hazard from small ferrous objects 600 G (60mT)	Allowed TWA for routine exposure (whole body) (8-hour TWA*) 6000 G (600mT)	Allowed TWA for routine exposure (extremities) (8-hour TWA*) 20,000 G (2T)	Whole body ceiling limit (no exposure allowed above this limit) 50,000 G (5T)	Extremity ceiling limit (no exposure allowed above this limit) * TWA exposure time is normally a concern only for extremely high field exposures to the whole body. 1 2003 TLVS® and BEIs® based on the ""Documentation of the Threshold Limit Values for Chemical Substances and Physical Agents &amp; Biological Exposure Indices,"" ACGIH Worldwide, p. 142",®

There are a whole laundry list of [problems with Single Transferable Vote](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Issues_affecting_the_Single_Transferable_Vote).  Personally I think the biggest is that a party that a minority of people wanted can get a majority of the seats. As famously happened in [Malta in 1981](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1981_election_in_Malta).  But then again, no voting system is perfect. And I don't mean that flippantly. It has been [mathematically proven](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow%27s_impossibility_theorem) that no voting system could ever exist that accurately reflects the will of the people.  This is typical of reddit. Thinking that if we could all just do VerySimpleThingX™ that life would be all sunshine and lollipops and everything bad in life would just vanish. But we cant because the puppet-master overlords wont let us. It is a folly born of youth. (If I could eat ice cream for dinner, everything would be great! It is so very very simple.

Second, they are bad for health on their own right, even when best of breed™. That merits good taxation, to offset for the danger.  Problem with buyer decisions are e.g.:  * lack of information that allow making let them informed decision, and bad goods producer certainly wants it that way, at least until goods are sold  * buyer's intentional disregard for consequences of his acts on us all (e.g. bought bad booze, got poisoning and took up a perfectly good spot in urgency).",™

We are also aiming to inform players of the precise duration of any weekly maintenance period at least 24 hours before the maintenance begins.  &gt;For our new players, this weekly maintenance is done in order to make general improvements and to check performance of the game so that we can continue to provide a consistent, quality experience. Quite often (but not always) after a maintenance period there will a patch to download.

t5_2qh2z,the_raptor,1326124540,"&gt;Often fantasy and scifi are two sides of the same coin  No. Star Wars isn't sci-fi it is space opera. However most people are incredibly ignorant and if it has space ships in it then they call it sci-fi. Sci-fi is science fiction, and Star Wars contains precious little science or even technology that couldn't be easily replicated by technology in another era (eg the droids are just the peasants from *Hidden Fortress*, X-wings are horses, the Millennium Falcon is a boat).  &gt;but for some reason people seem to prefer scifi over fantasy  Really? Go walk into a book store (if these still exist where you live) and compare the size of the sci-fi section versus the fantasy section. Then exclude all the space opera and future fantasy books in the ""sci-fi"" section. You will be left with a tiny amount of books that are actual sci-fi (ie dealing with humans reactions to speculative science/technology).  &gt;I've seen plenty of threads about fantasy being done to death.  The problem with fantasy is too much of it can't move on from Tolkein or Medieval fantasy in general. The idea seems to be that you aren't a Real Fantasy Author™ unless you are writing about Orcs and Elves. Everything Pixar has ever done is fantasy, but completely different to Tolkeinesque fantasy.  &gt;Does the space setting really add anything to the story or is it all window dressing?  Window dressing. The entire thing could be re-done with Samurai, Knights, or Cowboys.",™

An “OEM” license is a license distributed by an Original Equipment Manufacturer, or an “OEM.”  An OEM is a person or company who builds and sells computers.  Some OEMs also distribute software, especially operating systems such as Microsoft® Windows.   **What is the difference between OEM product and Full-Packaged Product (FPP)?**   ANSWER.  OEM products are intended to be preinstalled on hardware before the end user purchases the product.  They are “shrink wrapped” and do not come in a box like the retail products do.  Full-Packaged Product (FPP) is boxed with CD(s), manuals, and the EULA and is sold in retail stores in individual boxes.  The End User License Agreements (commonly referred to as “EULAs”) for OEM and FPP products are slightly different.  One main difference is that an OEM operating system license (such as the license for Windows) cannot be transferred from its original PC to another PC.   However, the FPP version of Windows may be transferred to another PC as long as the EULA, manual and media (such as the backup CD) accompany the transfer to the other PC.  Also, when a customer purchases an OEM product, the OEM license requires the OEM to provide support for the product.     ",®

The milk should be no more than 100 degrees F (40 degrees C). Let stand for 15 minutes until the yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam.  Whisk the eggs, melted butter, and vanilla extract into the yeast mixture until evenly blended; set aside. Stir together the flour and salt in a separate large bowl, and make a well in the center. Pour the egg mixture into the well, then stir in the flour mixture until a soft dough forms. Cover with a light cloth and let rise in a warm place (80 to 95 degrees F (27 to 35 degrees C)) until doubled in volume, about 30 minutes.  Gently mix in the pearl sugar.

In hindsight I know this now, but back when the internet was 56k AOL-style and you couldn't just look up ""What does it mean if she says blahblahblah,"" you had to go off what you know about girls.  When you're 17, you usually don't know much.  There's no manual for this shit.  If someone's a real true friend, you shouldn't be worried about telling them simply, ""I like you as a friend, I'm just not interested in you like that.""  Some guys, the ""Nice Guys™,"" will usually flip out and go apeshit and whatnot.  The guys that are nice (and not just in it for ass) will understand it's rejection, learn from it, and, if they were ever friends to begin with, stay friends.    To me, being blunt and honest is a win-win situation.  For the guy, you don't end up feeling used (regardless of whether it's valid or not), it's a learning experience, and it convinces you to stop trying and pursue someone else.  For the girl, it clearly defines the relationship (so it won't get awkward at some point), weeds out the guys that are pretending to be friends, and (attempts to) prevent the guy from turning into a stalker under the presumption that, ""Oh, she'll come around when she feels comfortable, I'll just play the waiting game.""

I suppose you didnâ€™t tell her your name until she asked for it [IOI], she should know it by now, if she doesnâ€™t thatâ€™s a GREAT opportunity to bust her balls on it.      Step two: Open      â€œHello?â€?      Ok, this is where I used to get stuckâ€¦      What to say when she answers? I used to be so pissed at this so I tried all the ways I could to open a girl on the phoneâ€¦ I tried several different ways such as:      â€¢ Saying ""Sevennnn dayyyssssss"" using a creepy voice. Some were amused by it; others got shit scared and hung up.      â€¢ I started singing       ""I say boom boom boom! Let me hear ya say EO"" which they laughed sometimes, but that made me look like a clown.      â€¢ I also tried making it like she was the one calling ""Hello? Who is this? Oh hey you... what do you want..."" which didnâ€™t come up that bad actually.      But then I read on the forum the Experimental Myspace FR Heartwork did and realised that was one of the best ways to open. And I quote:      â€œHB: Hello?      Heartwork: Guess who!?      HB: wait who is this?!      Heartwork: Who is the coolest guy you have been talking to online the past day or so?      HB: Heartwork!      Heartwork: just heartwork, show some enthusiasm. YELL IT      HB: HEARTWORK!      Heartwork: say I AM SOO HAPPY HEARTWORK CALLED ME      HB: I AM SOO FUCKING HAPPY HEARTWORK CALLED ME!!!!      Heartwork: haha you goof      HB: (laughing really hard)      Heartwork: On a scale of one to ten how happy are you that I called you?!      HB: haha! I dunno      Heartwork; shut up, yes you do, what is it?      HB: ummm 9!      Heartwork: sorry babe but if its anything less then a ten I am going to hang up right now and call my friend Sarah so she can say some nice things and make me feel better, cause right now you are bringing me down.      HB: 10!      Heartwork: thatâ€™s more like it.â€?      You all learn how to do that? Itâ€™s massive.      Gondole has this killer thing that goes like this.      He sends a message to her saying;      ""Look, before I call you, I don't want you to be like, ""hello? Who is this? Oh, hey Art'. I want you to be so excited and be like â€˜Oh Art! I'm so glad you called!â€™""      This will set up a positive vibe before she actually answers.      About time constraint:      Ok some people donâ€™t think its good to time constraint, but WHAT IF the conversation dies? You could STILL hang up first because you have an excuse since the beginning of the conversationâ€¦      ""Hey I canâ€™t really stay long, my friend Hour is waiting for me at his place but Guess what?!...""      Why should we hang up first?      All those good feelings you made her feel during the conversation will disappear when you hang up.    She will notice that you took those good feelings she was having just a minute ago away.      This will make her want to stick with you.      Step three: Demonstrate value      I'd like to start off explaining that woman donâ€™t act the same way at all as us guys on the phone.      When you call a guy you would say something like ""Hey buddy whatâ€™s up? Letâ€™s go clubbing""      Girls use it differently; they LOVE to talk on it.      By following this you should not be calling a girl for a date, but to talk; EVENTUALLY she will be the one asking for the date...      Are you with me here?      Call her to build comfort .      ""How was your day?""      You will also need to show at some point that you are a fun person that likes to go out. Show you are not a rat who stays the whole day in a fucking room staring at a screen.      Go out!      Have fun!           And call her while you are doing so!           It will improve your game by demonstrating you have higher value.      ""Really? Thatâ€™s interesting... listen youâ€™ll NEVER guess where I am right now...      I am at ------! And do you want to know what JUST happened?      O-M-G, you would have had so-o-o-o-o much fun if you were here with us""...      You get the idea?      They will notice how fun you are, and they will WANT to go out with you.      Be the party; tell them they wonâ€™t be able to roll with you because you are just TOO much.      â€œHey do you consider yourself fun? Well I am out with some friends right now and we are getting ready to have the funniest time of our lives, you think you can handle that?â€?      Step four: set the Meeting      This is where most people screw up.      They act like itâ€™s a BIG DEAL.      What to do in these situations? Just lay back.      Relax man.      Call her while you are with friends [women and men] and ask her if she wants to roll with you guys.      Tell her your friend Melissa wants to meet her.      Just talk and then bring up a meeting like its casual.      â€œWhere are you? Donâ€™t stay there come roll with us, we are fun-ER than themâ€?      Be mysterious, if you donâ€™t have your friends with you and you DO settle a date, tell her to bring candles , if she asks why; tell her sheâ€™ll find out.      Itâ€™s a good way to avoid flakes .      When she gets to you with the candles go with something like: â€œLeave those, we are not going to need themâ€?      Remember, you have to act like you are a fun, interesting and the coolest person she has ever met!      Talking on the phone...     ",™

t5_2rfte,Chuck_T_Bone,1326261979,"Warning** This post will be filled with poor grammar, and bad spelling.. However it contains good info.  If your looking to easy and simple Meat farming you need to first decide where you want to do it.  Easiest, Is to do Castle in the clouds in the sky. Doing this earns decent meat, decent items to auto sell, and some items to smash for twinkly wads.  First thing, you need to do is perm some basic key skills to up your farming power the following skills will provide helpful.  Musk of the Moose (SC)  (+5 combat chance) Amphibian Sympathy (TT) (+5 fam weight) Expert Panhandling (SC) (+10% meat) Leash of Linguini (PM) (+5 fam weight)  I personally Farm as a DB, for rav combos, so i will not bother listing there skills or moxie sign skills as you should have them by default.  You want to find a buffbot, and get the following buffs.  Fat Leon's Phat Loot Lyric Empathy of the Newt Polka of Plenty Sonata of Sneakiness   You want to get monster bait (to decrease the Non combats,) You also want sonata of sneakiness for this ( you can pay for the buff from a buff bot)    You will want to pick up some gear that is heavy in +meat, and secondary + item . But + meat will earn you the biggest bang for you buck. Easy list of items to buy/get are follows:  ancient turtle shell helmet duct tape shirt poodle skirt Coily™ natty blue ascot Order of the Silver Wossname Monster Bait ittah bittah hookah  For a familiar i use the 2 mr A fairy/chaun (you can be fine with just a chaun, or even better hobo monkey)  I however, use a nurse hat and use Disco combos/rave combos, to up my meat %   I also keep pet buffing spray/Nasal spray going at all times.  Another note, you may want to get yourself, a roll over bonus turn set, and equip it before you log out. Getting yourself extra turns per day = pure profit.  your diet, also needs to be weighed carefully. To make sure your not spending more meat on those turns then they are earning you back. So if your MPA is not high your never going to make back the meat you spent on the food.  IE. if you spend 100k on 100 turns (you need to make over 1000 meat per turn to profit.) However if you spend 100k on 300 turns, you only need to make 334 meat per turn to profit. Just keep it in perspective.  This is a pretty basic way to set yourself up for around 1k mpa  in the castle.  there are alot of ways to improve this but the one thing is, if you say want to upgrade to a MR. A item, that costs say 10mil, meat and it only gives you say 20% more meat.. how many advs is it going to take to pay back that 10mil.   I also highly suggest you donate a few dollars to support the game and and get yourself some Mr.A stuff. the current ITOM is pretty damn nice. If anything to cast every day and sell for easy money.

t5_2s7cl,chloe-bell,1326292946,"When it comes to raising my children, I do the exact opposite of what my parents did! LOL Other than the typical stuff like, be tolerant &amp; accepting of everyone's differences, never make fun of anyone for any reason, don't be rude etc. Pretty much anything that falls in line with growing into a self sufficient adult.  My kids are responsible for: waking up on their own (since about age 10) with an alarm (I'm always up as back up)  They clean up; One's chore is to do dishes, one has to sweep &amp; steam mop the floor, nd on garbage day, they both take the garbage up front to the pile. The 2 older ones (13 &amp; 15) do their own laundry, they clean their room twice a week, clean out the tub when they're done showering (so it doesn't get yucky build up)  3 nights a week they make dinner for their little sister (2) and clean up while I take their other little sister (5) to dance classes.  They do have cell phones with the $35 unlimited prepaid plans, nothing fancy.. if they want  fancy phone, they buy it themselves. My oldest just saved up for an android phone. When I have it, I give them money to go to games (sports) or to the movies maybe once or twice a month)  They are expected to make good grades. Anything on their report card under a 90% isn't acceptable and they will lose privileges (phone &amp; internet time usually) until next report card. They have a 8pm curfew on school nights, 10pm on weekends. Usually on the weekends or when I have off, they'll watch their sisters so I can sleep for a bit. I work 3rd shift, so I run on very little sleep! I try to sleep during the day on the sofa while my 2 year old plays around. I get up to feed her lunch and then lay back down. So, usually on a Saturday morning they'll get the girls up and make them pancakes and entertain them. They do this 100% on their own... They're such good kids ♥  I get a lot of flack from my sister in law who's kids are 12 and 15. They are left to do whatever they want - no rules at all. They're allowed to pick the slacker classes in school, never do home work, I see them up at 1am on facebook on school nights, their room is a disaster etc. etc. etc. So, I'm viewed as a ""nazi"" because I try to be the parent, not the BFF. My kid are happy though. I grew up having my grandmother wait on me hand and foot, so I was 24 (when she died) before I learned to wake up on my own or do much of anything really. Also, when we were off at my dad' for the weekend, it was a free for all - The only rule was that we couldn't drink his orange juice. Bad news! I had learned a lot of life's lessons the hard way.

Here’s how it works: If an inquiry occurs because you applying for auto or mortgage credit (and yes, FICO knows), for the first 30 days that inquiry won’t count at all. After 30 days pass, the FICO scoring model will look to see if there are other auto or mortgage inquiries. If there are multiple inquiries for those types of loans within a 14-day time frame, those multiple inquiries will only count as one inquiry in your score. There are even newer versions of the FICO scoring software that will count auto and mortgage inquiries within a 45 day period as one inquiry in your score. But, to be safe, do your shopping in a 14 day period. Not all lenders are using the most up-to-date FICO scoring software.  [source](http://www.credit.com/rs/vol17.jsp)",®

The word 'LEGO', when used as a noun, should only refer to the company that makes the product. Otherwise 'LEGO' is supposed to be used as an adjective. Thus, when referring to the pieces, neither 'lego' nor 'legos' is correct... rather one should say: 'LEGO bricks' or 'LEGO pieces' or whatever (using LEGO as an adjective -- and one should really capitalize all of the letters, and put the little 'circle-R' symbol after it (®)).

If you want to stay away from fast-paced so you can work on correct alignment to better support yourself than I'd stay away from Bikram, Baptiste, Corepower, and Power Yoga. For Now.   Ultimately I'd say that your concerns about the extra weight and the faster pace are probably for naught. I've had lots of bigger students before and they had no more issues than anyone else. If you were to venture into those classes it would likely work out just fine (especially if you had a good knowledgable teacher) but if you're more comfortable starting slower - then by all means do that. It's your practice and you should feel comfortable, safe, and taken care of.  There's also classes and styles sometimes that cater to the overweight. If you can find them it sounds like you might really like those. They focus a lot on safety and the needs of larger students.

t5_2qhq6,PrincessSparkleslut,1326349749,"Yoga CAN help with weight loss. I've known people that completely changed their bodies with just yoga. That said - it can, but don't count on it. It will happen for sure, but I wouldn't outright *suggest* yoga for it's weight loss abilities. Usually one of the major ways yoga helps that is by making you more aware of your body and what you put in it (and how much you put in it). So your nutrition gets a little better plus you're being active in a hopefully challenging way.  Lots of people like that Bikram helps them lose weight each class, but most of the time (not always) it's primarily water weight they lost from all the sweating and it'll come right back. But the work is also hard so that does contribute to long term fat loss and strength gain.  What would probably help you the most is getting more muscle. Whether through yoga which I think is the **best** way or through weight training. Either way - muscle weighs more than fat, *but* it also burns fat off your body much quicker. So you not only get leaner faster, but you get a nice shape from the muscles to eventually reveal once some of the fat goes away.

t5_2r1ca,Occulto,1326362564,"&gt;Any places I should check out? Bars, entertainment, etc.  It's probably easiest to describe the main entertainment strips in Adelaide.  Gouger St - restaurants... and lots of them. Plenty of opportunities for a cheap feed. The Central Markets and Chinatown are near there too.   Hindley St - comes in two parts. The east half is where you'll find the tattoo parlors, strip clubs, hotted up commodores and kids puking in gutters at 3am. The west half is more eclectic with a more ""alternative"" crowd (except for HQ which is Adelaide's ""super club""). Try the Grace Emily (usually have live music) and Supermild (for a late night cocktail).  Rundle St - more upmarket than Hindley St. Lots of restaurants, cafes and higher end retail. The ""Beautiful People™"" like to hang out there. Right in the middle though, is the Adelaide institution known as the Exeter. It's a dingy pub that somehow manages to stay the same, year after year. Don't let the decor fool you, it has one of the best wine cellars in Adelaide. Wednesday night is curry night, which is always worth a visit. Just down the road (on Grenfell St) is the Crown and Anchor. Plenty of metal/goth/alternative crowd and cheap piss.  ",™
t5_2qh1i,mrjast,1326367807,"The way I see it, the ego is mostly a collection of things you ""should"" or ""must"" be, or of denials.  How does an ego get bruised, normally? Something happens that demonstrates that you are not acting (or thinking, or whatever) to the standard you think you should. Perhaps you get insulted, or you publicly goof up something, and it goes against The Plan™ that you should be loved by everyone and be successful in everything you do. Or, even more commonly, someone criticises you and you're not really willing to consider the criticism because it would mean that you're wrong.  The solution is to be more flexible. It's unavoidable that life won't always go as you want it to go. Really. No matter how much money or practise or power you have, there will always be situations in which you find yourself falling short of your expectations. Few people really take the time to understand this simple fact. It's easy to just go ""yeah, sort of makes sense"" and stop thinking about it. But perhaps you still wish for things to be different, for a world in which perfection is possible. Stop wishing that. It's a pipe dream. Cling to it and you'll only depress yourself.  Instead, vow to get really good at playing by the rules (the rule is that you can't prevent failure). Failure (or anything else that ""hurts the ego"") itself says nothing about you as a person. It's more likely to happen if you overestimated your abilities, but in general it just means that whatever you did didn't work out, and that you just learned a lesson. There are ways to learn lessons without messing up, but as I said: failure means nothing! You probably believe it does – virtually everyone believes it – so your job is to change that belief. How to do that depends on which other stupid things you believe (that's nothing personal, by the way – pretty much everyone believes tons of stupid things). I can't really fit all of that into a single post, so I'm just going to leave it at that for now.",™

t5_2rfte,doctoreldritch,1326393474,"Cleaned up version, for the betterment of all mankind (with thanks to Chuck for typing this all out in the first place):   If you're looking for easy and simple Meat farming, you first need to decide where you want to do it.  The easiest choice is to do Castle in the Clouds in the Sky.  Farming this area earns decent meat, decent items to auto-sell, and some items to smash for twinkly wads.  The first thing you need to do is perm some key skills, to up your farming power.  The following skills will prove helpful:  * Musk of the Moose (SC) - +5 combat chance (self-buff, 10MP)    * Amphibian Sympathy (TT) - +5 familiar weight (passive)    * Leash of Linguini (PM) - +5 fam weight (self-buff, 12MP)    * Expert Panhandling (SC) - +10% meat (passive)     It is optimal to farm as a DB (for pickpocketing and the rave combos), under either the Wombat zodiac sign^# , so you should not need to perm the relevant DB and Gnomish skills.  For completeness, however, they are:  * Nimble Fingers (DB) - +20% meat (passive)    * Mad Looting Skillz (DB) - +20% items (passive)    * Gnefarious Pickpocketing (gnome) - +10% meat (passive)    * Powers of Observatiogn (gnome) - +10% items (passive)    * Torso Awaregness (gnome) - unlock shirt equipment slot  Also, to boost pickpocketing:  * Overdeveloped Sense of Self Preservation (DB) - +20% initiative (passive)     Additionally, two reusable skill books from past Crimbos are potentially relevant to meat-farming:     * Fashionably Late (CRIMBCO #1) - +1 adventure per day (passive)    * Jingle Bells (Crimbo Carol #2) - Familiar acts more frequently in combat (buff, 5MP)^##  Finally, depending on availability and how long you intend to remain in aftercore for farming, it may or may not be worthwhile to acquire the clan dungeon skills:  * Thrift and Grift (hobo) - +10% meat (passive)    * Natural Born Scrabbler (hobo) - +5% items (passive)    * Slimy Shoulders (slime) - +(2*n)% initiative (passive)^###    You want to find a buffbot (see [here](http://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Buffbot) for examples), and get the following buffs:  * Fat Leon's Phat Loot Lyric - +20% items    * Empathy of the Newt - +5 familiar weight    * Polka of Plenty - +50% meat    * ~~Sonata of Sneakiness~~ **Carlweather's Cantata of Confrontation** +5% combat chance     Your diet also needs to be planned carefully.  It is important to make sure you're not spending more meat on those turns then they are earning you back; *eg.* if you spend 100k to gain 100 turns, you need to be making over 1000 meat per turn in order to turn a profit from those 100 extra turns.  However, if you spend 100k on 300 turns, you only need to make 334 meat per turn to make a profit.  If this is too complicated to figure out for yourself, you can simply determine your expected meat-per-adventure returns and use [this handy tool](http://www.houeland.com/kol/diets?goal=adventures&amp;organ=stomach&amp;nightcap=yes&amp;semirares=1&amp;items=tuxedo&amp;cost=reasonable), created and maintained by Eleron (player# 1564433) of Alliance From Hell, to determine your optimal diet.    Generally speaking, having Stomach of Steel is better than Liver of Steel for farming purposes, but at very high MPA this difference disappears.  You will want to pick up some gear that provides +meat and, secondarily, +item.  Boosting +1% item is worth approximately 0.7% meat equivalent without olfaction, and approximately +1.1% meat equivalent with olfaction, but suffers from diminishing returns at higher levels due to drop capping (where a drop is already guaranteed, so further +item does nothing).    A list of easy-to-acquire items is as follows:  * ancient turtle shell helmet    * duct tape shirt \[ed: Cane-mail and BGE 'cuddly critter' shirts are good fill-ins while you farm duct tape\]    * poodle skirt      * Coily™^#### \[ed: at lower levels, use Bar Whip + Ellsbury's Skull\]   * ~~natty blue ascot~~ \[ed: natty blues are never worth the price\]    * Order of the Silver Wossname    * Lucky Rabbit's Foot    * Monster Bait    * Ittah Bittah Hookah     For high-rollers, the optimal equipment set is the Hodgman's outfit with an Invisible Hamster and Lucky Sock, plus Origami Pasties, Bottle-Rocket Crossbow, and a Stinky Cheese Eye for 100 adventures per day (to charge the Diaper), to be replaced by Monster Bait.  Barring the full Hodgman getup, a Crown of Thrones with Knob Goblin Organ Grinder enthroned, and two BRCs (or BRC + Bag o' Tricks) should be used.  Optimal familiars for Castle-farming are, in descending order:   1. Stocking Mimic (use Loathing Legion Helicopter instead of Hookah, and extend combat to 10 rounds)    2. Hobo Monkey (extend combat to 10 rounds)    3. any Fairychaun    4. any Leprechaun    You can also use a nurse hat (or other source of MP regen) to help fuel Disco/Rave combos, if that is more profitable than whatever item it is displacing (note that with a Mimic and/or with Hodgman gear, you will already have more MP than you can use).  It is also optimal to keep Nasal Spray running, but all other item-based buffs should be avoided, as they are not cost-effective.  Another note: you will want to get yourself a rollover bonus turn set, and equip it before you log out.  Getting yourself extra turns per day = pure profit.  An easy-to-acquire starter outfit is as follows:  * Leather Aviator's Cap    * General Sage's Lonely Diamonds Club Jacket    * paperclip pants    * sword behind inappropriate prepositions    * Fudgecycle    * BGE Pocket Calendar    * Imitation Nice Watch OR Glow-in-the-Dark Wristwatch OR Wristwatch of the White Knight (get whichever is cheapest)  The current optimal, still-acquirable (ie no Uncle Hobo's Beard) and non-moon-dependent outfit is as follows:  * Leather Aviator's Cap    * General Sage's Lonely Diamonds Club Jacket    * Stinky Cheese Diaper (charged)    * Time Sword * Loathing Legion Moondial    * Fudgecycle    * BGE Pocket Calendar    * Dead Guy's Memento (technically the Counterclockwise Watch is better, but it's also unrealistically expensive) * Disembodied Hand + Time Sword  When upgrading gear, as with diet, it's important to do a cost-benefit analysis for any major purchases.  If, say, you wanted to upgrade to a Mr. A item that costs 9 million meat and it only gives you, say, +20% meat, you should be aware of how many adventures it is going to take to pay back that 9Mm (in this example, it would take ~333 thousand turns, or roughly 3 years of continuous farming at ~300 turns/day, to make that money back).  **Generally speaking, most Mr. A-tier gear is *not* cost-effective, due to the high price tag, so you should never buy high-cost farming items if you would not otherwise want to own them.**  It is also highly suggested that you donate a few dollars (in $10 increments) to support the game and get yourself some Mr. A stuff (either directly, or by selling the Mr. As you get from donating).  The current IoTM (Jan 2012, Libram of Resolutions), for example, is pretty damn nice, if only to cast every day and sell for easy money.    ----------------------  \# Generally speaking, Wombat is better than Blender for Castle farming.  20% meat is worth approx. 33 meat per adventure, on average; therefore Wombat is better than Blender if 33*Adv &gt; 5*MPA.  Given estimates of Adv ~250 and MPA ~1000, for example, Wombat is worth ~8250 meat and Blender is worth ~5000 meat, so Wombat wins.  However, if your MPA is high enough and/or your adventures per day low enough, Blender can, in principle, come out ahead.  \#\# Jingle Bells is useful only if you have either a Hobo Monkey or a Stocking Mimic.     \#\#\# n = the number of slime-soaked sweat glands you have (ever) used, up to 10; the skill is not auto-permed, but this counter persists between ascensions  \#\#\#\# Coily can't be purchased directly; you'll need to buy Medium Slimy Cysts and use them until one drops, which is random (5% chance per cyst)",™

The national Girl Scout organization reviews and approves all varieties proposed by the bakers. Any of the five optional cookies can be changed every year.

t5_mouw,thefalcone,1326429925,"&gt; The claim that only Dr. Das had access to his computer which was in his locked office. In fact, Dr. Das claims the chief informant in this case, whom the university does not reveal, also had a key to Dr. Das’ office. Dr. Das asserts his office was not private and “anyone could use it.”  • The university’s report stems from a paper published in a 2008 issue of Free Radical Biology &amp; Medicine, a peer-reviewed journal. Why did the university choose to wait three years to publish these allegations that were refuted by Dr. Das over two years ago? No retraction of that published report was called for at that time.  • Dr. Das was blind-sided by the university, being completely unaware of the release of these allegations to the news press. Dr. Das had to be informed of the negative news reports by his colleagues. He was prevented from making a timely response to all of these charges. The news press reports Dr. Das did not return phone calls, which is pejorative, as he was away from his desk and was not monitoring his calls.  • The University of Connecticut report alleges Dr. Das “defunded” the work of a student in his lab because she did not produce results that he wanted. Investigation into this matter shows that Dr. Das “defunded” the work of this researcher from his budget because she was devoting all of her time to another researcher in the same laboratory, who turns out to be the informant or “whistle-blower” in this case, the very same person who also had a key to Dr. Das’ office.  • Another student researcher who worked in Dr. Das’ laboratory in 2008 discloses that the informant in this case was a trouble maker who chased away many other researchers by intentionally causing friction in Dr. Das’ lab. The former student says the university informant in this case even attempted to “pour wine down her mouth,” hoping to get her to reveal negative things about Dr. Das. The student says she did not witness any scientific irregularities in Dr. Das’ lab during her tenure there, which included Western Blot tests that were alleged to be doctored.  • Another party, a university internal investigator whom Dr. Das accuses of long-standing prejudice against foreign-born researchers, reportedly broke the lock on Dr. Das’ office door, removed computer files and personal items such as bank records and a passport, and could have manipulated data in his computer files. Dr. Das says this university investigator has had a long-standing vendetta against him going back to 1984.  • Dr. Das says he has not personally conducted laboratory bench tests for many years now and that his students and other subordinates conducted all the tests, including the allegedly doctored Western Blot tests. Even if doctored and inaccurate, these tests in no way invalidate the many health claims associated with resveratrol, a red wine molecule. Dr. Das says most of his work has been corroborated by other researchers including his important finding that resveratrol protects the heart against damage prior a heart attack.  • While the news media made quick association between Dr. Das and a particular brand of resveratrol pill he has tested, Dr. Das has no commercial relationship and does not serve as a paid consultant to any manufacturer of resveratrol pills. He served as an unpaid expert for an online interview of a particular brand of resveratrol, a pill that his laboratory found to be superior to plain resveratrol in laboratory studies. A spokesman for that company, Bill Sardi, managing partner for Resveratrol Partners LLC, dba Longevinex®, says his company has donated product to researchers including Dr. Das’ lab and has underwritten some of the expenses involved in conducting tests, but no researchers have received pay offs or have personally profited from their studies involving his product. Mr. Sardi says his company has not sought to influence the outcome of any independent or sponsored studies. Resveratrol Partners LLC is a private company based in Las Vegas, Nevada.",®

In the description, ""Climara ® , estradiol transdermal system, is designed to release estradiol continuously upon application to intact skin.

Anyhow what you're looking for it looks like is ** BIOAVAILABILITY.** Absorption greatly affects bioavailability and then I'd have to teach you all the aspects of pharmacokinetics but thats not a strong point of mine. However, if you look above at the bolded thats all you need to really know. It's much harder to find exact numbers as most are buried within papers of research that cost money to find out.   You could probably derive it if you got PK skills, but PK was one of my weakest areas so I can't help that much. ;/   I found it funny that in the Climara patch it says you get higher Cmax and Cavg if you put it on your butt.

t5_2siab,Mandril,1326473090,"I'm Mandril, visual arts/graphic design student from the Netherlands.  My first anime was [Ahiru no Quack](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=1049) or maybe [Shin chan](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=540) . My first anime, knowing it was anime was probably [Gundam Wing](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=26) or Dragonball Z. My favorite anime is [FLCL](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=277). I also like Mononoke, Kemonozume, Haruhi, Mahoujin Guruguru and shorts such as La Maison en Petits Cubes, Cat Soup &amp; Father and Daughter.  I don't buy manga often, but what I do buy I absolutely adore reading over and over and over. I own in manga form: Yotsuba&amp;!, Mushishi, Monster, Pluto, The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, FLCL. Also, the belgian comic scene is amazing and I'd recommend any manga fan to give it a try. If you don't know where to start, give [""The Man Who Grew His Beard"" by Olivier Schrauwen](http://www.amazon.com/Man-Who-Grew-His-Beard/dp/1606994468) a try.  I love watching certain anime but don't care about otaku-culture. Conventions, cosplay, fanart &amp; meme's don't interest me at all. Hence my subscription to this simpler subreddit.

t5_2fwo,Freeky,1326478434,"&gt; disks, for example, are split into slices, and then those slices are partitioned. For example, the fifth partition on the first slice on the third disk is /dev/ad2s1e.  That's the old MBR + BSD disklabel stuff.  These days GPT is often preferred, especially if combined with ZFS.  Also if you have an AHCI-capable or Marvell SATA controller, you'll want their specific drivers (ahci/mvs) which are considerably simpler and more performant.  This gives you names like /dev/ada2p5.

t5_2qh0u,drakeg4,1326514342,"As someone completely foreign to the Sonic and Zim fanbases, I can't state their reason for being fans but I do sub to /r/mlp and /r/pokemon, mostly because of the community. I haven't actually played pokemon in years and haven't actually seen the TV show since Gen1 but I still have a fascination with it and the community is generally pretty interesting, the fan created artwork can get pretty stunning as well. As for /r/mlp, I thought it was pretty damn strange at first but I figured there had to be a reason for the popularity so I gave it a chance, sat down and watched i think 5-6 episodes (can't judge a show based on 1-2 episodes). It was fun to watch. It isn't Citizen Kane, it isn't the second coming of FSM, it was just generally fun to watch. As an aside, I watch a lot of Pixar and Dreamworks films so I guess I have a predisposition to enjoy animation. Anyways, MLP doesn't have world class art direction, the plot isn't super deep, and the characters are all pretty archetypal but it has a charm about it that is hard to describe. I just enjoy watching it. I don't have a victim complex, I'm usually pretty tongue-in-cheek about how I like a ""girls cartoon"". I'm pretty sure the folks at /r/mlp could tell you the same thing. Though this may be specific to the mlp community for the sole reason that the shows central tenant is tolerance. Hell, here is a quote from the FAQ  &gt;I'm sorry, I didn't like it.  &gt;It's okay! We all like different things and that's what makes us great as individuals. We respect your opinion of not liking it, all we ask for is that you respect ours as well for enjoying it. Just because we don't like the same thing it's not a reason to start hating each other.  Also,  &gt;I could go into a Sonic Forum, clearly, concisely point out why many of the modern sonic titles are bad games, and be flooded instantly with claims of me being a troll.  This points to me as strange. Why would you go to a forum for a fanbase and tell them why they shouldn't like something? Why would anyone outside of any community walk in and tell them why you think their community sucks? Obviously they have found something in it that you haven't.  Lastly yes, there is a plethora of shitty art. This doesn't even apply to fanbases, this applies to the entire planet. Most people suck shit at art, but they still want to show it off for some reason. Just look at all the shitty pics of random things taken on iPhones and filtered through some app and posted onto Facebook. Good artists are a minority but you can't judge a community based on the quality of the artwork. My favorite webcomics (xkcd, Cy&amp;H, and Scandinavia vs the World) all use extremely simplistic graphic to tell a message. But you know what? There is also dresden codak, a true artist among webcomic makers. Does the simplistic artwork of xkcd and Cy&amp;H take away from the quality of dresden? Not for a second. Nor do his amazing skills take away from the quality of humor of the simpler comics. DA is just a giant aggregation of images that people have created and when you get so much content, almost all of it will be shit (man this is sounding more and more like a critique of Reddit). If you don't like the art, there is a back button on your browser.  TL;DR Communities are based around the strengths of the subject, not its weaknesses. Do you think there would be fans of anything if they just brooded on the faults of their particular brand of fandom? There are people with victim complexes, some more vocal than others but trust me, no matter the community, most of the members are normal, average people like you and me.

t5_2qh61,happybadger,1326519379,"So a man teaches himself to fish, as the privatised and therefore for-profit school system cut fishing class because it cut into their bottom line. It's cool, he found a guide online. He decides to take up fishing in the local river which smells a little funky because the EPA was dismantled and local factories found it to be cheaper if they dumped their waste in the river instead of at proper storage facilities. It's cool, he'll just boil them.  The guy catches a lot of fish using the dynamite method he learned online, which is cool because there's no Department of Natural Resources to fine for that and no ATF to restrict the sale of dynamite. He decides to open a restaurant, Guy's Fishatorium. The place isn't so clean because there's no health regulations, but that's cool because he saves time which can be better spent fishing. Likewise, he doesn't quite keep those fish at federally-mandated temperatures between boat and plate, but they're still cooked and the public doesn't really have any means of learning that undercooked seafood can cause illness. And I wouldn't recommend sitting down for long, as there's no building standards board so the roof might collapse and the gas main might explode without warning.   His restaurant is a huge success, but of course that inspires competitors who also dynamite fish. It kind of destroys the river, but that's no problem because they can just import fish cheaply from other cities since there's no US Fish and Wildlife Service to restrict seafood export from areas which otherwise couldn't legally sell their fish. Because the CDC and USDA don't exist, nobody can tell Guy that his fish are responsible for a salmonella outbreak, no doubt due to the improper handling which had no consequence, and because nobody can legally tell him that he can't continue to sell in a completely free market. Only his competitors are selling the same fish, so it's a bit broader. Those fish also have high levels of heavy metal contamination, and while that's bad for the customers (though not really, I mean if they can afford to go to a privatised hospital which lacks sanitation regulations and that uses supplies made without industrial regulation they'll probably live through their bout of arsenic, lead, or mercury poisoning. The aluminium poisoning may give them some sort of exotic cancer, but it's nothing compared to the cancers they'll develop from the asbestos lining their workplaces since nobody is around to enforce its removal after it becomes a known carcinogen), it doesn't hurt Guy because no public research laboratories exist that can provide an unbiased test on Guy's fish.   The important thing here is that Guy retains his rights to free enterprise, the American Dream™ brought to you by Marlboro- *Good for You, Good for Kids™*.

t5_2qj8f,Gantrof,1326519564,"This comment certainly makes me curious about Marketplace's methods.  &gt;It's rather pathetic when you can't trust a consumer advocacy program to be straight with its viewers. I'm in no position to judge the accuracy of all the revelations, [but simply by following the link to the study Marketplace commissioned](http://www.cbc.ca/marketplace/includes/2012/episodes/whatfx/images/coldfx_metaanalysis_2011nov09.pdf) one can find a much more nuanced verdict on the efficacy of Cold FX. To begin with, the scientist didn't do an independent search of the literature in case there were other studies of Cold FX out there. He only analyzed the four submitted to him by Marketplace. Let's assume those studies are representative. What the scientist found on duration and severity was not ""evidence of absence"" (of effects, or ""FX""), as Marketplace revels in claiming, but absence of scientifically adequate evidence. More specifically, he found a modest benefit for Cold FX compared to placebo, but not a statistically significant one (as he did for cold frequency). In the case of duration, two of the four studies were eligible, and the subjects who took cold FX enjoyed about 2 and 3 fewer days of illness, respectively. Marketplace wilfully neglected to point this out to viewers and to explain that in clinical research an effect is conservatively deemed to be no effect at all (i.e., possibly due to chance) if the statistical odds of it being due to chance are greater than just 5% or 1 in 20. When it came to the effect on cold duration, the odds were borderline significant: 6% or about 1 in 16. To put it another way, the odds of Cold FX's clinical advantage over placebo being real were 16 to 1 - respectable odds in real life, but not quite good enough in cautious science. Marketplace viewers should have been told this. Scientists consider results like this to be suggestive and a sign that more research - which enhances the capacity to establish a statistically significant effect - are justified. In the case of severity, the benefit from Cold FX (compared to placebo) was about 30% in one study and nearly 20% in the other eligible study. Once again, the effect wasn't statistically significant, but in real world terms the odds were 10 to 1 that the effect was real. Perhaps most telling is how the scientist commissioned by Marketplace concluded his paper:  ""In summary, these results support the effectiveness of COLD-FX® for preventing colds. There is insufficient evidence of a reduction in severity or duration of colds.""  I've never used Cold FX (always seemed overpriced to me). This is just me - an occasional medical journalist with an understanding of clinical research - being royally POed (again: the hatchet job on homeopathy was the last example) by the irresponsibility of a public broadcaster's program manipulating viewer sentiment for a good story at the expense of public education.

t5_2qi6d,movzx,1326589835,"Let's see...  After taking the MSF course I decided I definitely wanted a bike. I browsed CL forever and decided to give this one bike a ride.  On my first test ride I:   * ☑ Couldn't get it into neutral after stopping at a sign   * ☑ Stalled the bike multiple times   * ☑ Had problems shifting   * ☑ Had to do a multiple point turn in order to turn around  The very first turn out of the neighborhood where I bought the bike:   * ☑ Went up onto the median between both lanes of traffic  After making it home and riding the bike to other places:   * ☑ Stalled all the time (later determined to be an electrical issue)   * ☑ Scraped the shit out of my engine guards on curbs from doing very wide U-turns   * ☑ Still went up on a curb occasionally from my wide U-turns  That was three or four years ago. I still make mistakes, everyone does. I was teaching my buddy to ride in a flat, open field. He was just standing there, straddling his bike... And he dropped it. It scared him much like you're worried now. If someone tells you they've never dropped, much less stalled, their bike they're a fucking liar.   Don't hop into traffic. Ride it around the neighborhood, ride it on empty roads. Ride it until you feel comfortable. You didn't just hop in a car and get into rush hour. You learned to drive and worked your way up.  Couple of words of advice... You'll probably notice that your hands are very sore after riding. This is because you're using a death grip. It's a perfectly normal reaction to the activity you're doing. It *will* pass as you learn to not be afraid on the bike.  Don't rely on your mirrors 100%. They're very small. Learn to use your head to check around you. Unlike a driver, you have an unobstructed view of anywhere you can look. Use this to your advantage.",☑

They have called this exact actuation. Then from the 1:1 (9speed section) ""1:1 Actuation™ is superior by design. Every unit of cable you pull moves the derailleur the same amount"". So this surely means that for 10sp the lever should be pulling exactly the same amount of cable as a 9 speed system in total across the width of the whole cassette just in smaller incriments. The width of the cassette has not changed so the amount of total cable pull in mm required remains intact. And if thats true the derailers should be cross compatible no? WHY AM I WRONG!!!1!!

I'm not convinced that an ad-supported version wouldn't make back the investment (I've built both Android and iOS apps before as well, so I'm speaking from some amount of experience, but as you know it comes down to intuition without more data like speculative AdWords.)  If you build a community around it though--maybe a small site where people can discuss and exchange these replays (which also has ads), or just more chat features in the actual app, then I'd say you have a much better chance of being able to turn a profit just based on increased ad impressions alone.

He has often shared that his decision was as much practical as spiritual. He believes that all franchised Chick-fil-A® Operators and Restaurant employees should have an opportunity to rest, spend time with family and friends, and worship if they choose to do so.

After all, his first act with humanity was to *expose one of God's lies*. Yahweh told the twins that if they ate from the Tree of Knowledge, they would ""surely die"". Anyone remember the scene after they ate from the tree? Anyone remember them surely dying? Anybody? No? Satan told Evie that she would NOT die, and look at that, SHE DIDN'T. God wanted his creations to be mindless thralls with no knowledge of good and evil, just meatbags running around in a glorified Habitrail™ telling God how awesome he is all day.

To be an 'official' librarian she'd have to get a master's degree, but many people have long, happy careers without the degree. As for wages, I have the MLS (Masters in Library Science) and I work in a special library, so I make decent (yet not fantastic) money. I would be content to have this job and this pay scale the rest of my life. People in school libraries or public libraries often make less money, but it can still be enough to live on.

t5_2qh33,stagier_malingering,1326674038,"Crap, apparently he's supposed to be from my home country, Moldova.   My first thought was actually about how weird it was for a Moldovan foreign exchange student to get into a prank war with his roommate. I mean, it definitely could happen, especially after a few months, but a lot of the Moldovan exchange students I've talked to seem like they'd never want to risk pissing off their roommates and *not* having a place to live, then having to go home for whatever reason. Moldova is frequently called the poorest country in Europe, so getting out specifically to get an education (especially considering the corrupt government and bureaucratic bullshit you have to go through) is pretty damn hard and expensive. Pranks like that are just something that I wouldn't expect.  According to my mom, to whim I showed this video, and who had lived in Moldova for a little over two decades, his reaction should have been to kick the guy in the face and not fall for it in the first place. ""How can you be so oblivious to your surroundings?"" she said. ""The guy was only 10cm away from his knee, how did he not hear the breathing or feel it on his leg?"". Then she added,  ""I don't think he's from Moldova. He'd be dead or too poor by now. People would mug you on the train by sharpening coins and using them to gut your bags. Then you have the gypsies. Hell, I used to have to carry a broom with me to the outhouse to fight off our turkey and some of the wild dogs!""  My dad nodded in agreement and said, ""Yeah, the fowl are pretty dangerous. Even ducks are pretty aggressive, but geese are probably one of the worst. They don't have talons like turkeys do, but when they attack, they kind of pull their heads back low to the ground and extend them like a snake would. That can break bones if you get hit. Their wings are also pretty powerful and can knock you off your feet."" Then he proceeded to explain the proper methods for goose and turkey fighting.   (Disclaimer for reddit: All of the above was translated into English from Angry Russian Rant™ and is a specific example not mean to represent the whole of Moldova. Similarly, the statements above that were a series of generalizations expressing a personal opinion, and should not be assumed as intended to apply to all Moldovans.)",™

t5_2cneq,barker76,1326723418,"pre-amble: Not my downvote.  &gt; Acting locally is usually horribly worse than acting on a federal scale.  Acting locally provides a local ecosystem where successful policies can bubble up through successively larger legislative bodies.  An unsuccessful wider application does not refute a successful case, either, it just reinforces that different localities have different priorities and aspirations.  The converse outcome of non-centralized planning is that unsuccessful policies are never imposed outside of the democratic sphere that selected them.  Like the Drug War.  Not only are others excepted from the force of bad local policies, but people can, in fact, discuss and organize specifically to reform them *even inside* the locality where they create problems.  &gt; It also avoids the amazing efficiency that economies of scale provide. 50 separate state healthcare programs are going to be way less efficient than one federal program.  Efficiency at what, though?  Yes, if it is good, it is good, but what if it is efficiently bad?  Health care is founded on creating positive outcomes and least harm.  If taking care of yourself and maintaining a productive work ethic results in crushing debt when you need health care, that's a very efficient, but systematic bad outcome.  And it's an outcome that is nearly impossible to reform through the federal legislative process.  &gt; Have you figured out what freedom argument you are going to make yet by the way?  I really have no clue what I'm supposed to tell you, but by all means, consider me to have made The Freedom Argument™ so you can say your piece.  I'm guessing you don't know a single doctor personally and, if you do, you haven't asked for comment on the ""marvel of the world in terms of efficiency"" which you attribute to Medicare.  Soviet (and Cuban) health care was amongst the most efficient in the world for its time also, but the doctors who flee these countries (when they have the choice) are symptomatic of the moral bankruptcy latent in the policy.

Agent Orange (half 2,4-D by composition) was extensively used in Vietnam by the military to destroy forests and crops.  Dow’s Christmas gift for America was formally announced, by the USDA, in the December 27, 2011 edition of the Federal Register.  If the federal government wants to bury something in the news, and burn up part of our window to publicly respond, you can bet they’ll do it around the holidays.  The public has 60 days to comment on Dow’s petition for deregulation, and can do so online at:  http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=APHIS-2010-0103-0001  Weeds are increasingly adapting to Monsanto’s genetically engineered line of crops that rely on the use of a different herbicide, glyphosate, which Monsanto markets as Round-up®.  This is leading competitors, like Dow, and proponents of GE agriculture to look for weed killing alternatives.  Herbicides more toxic than Round-up® appear to be next up in the pipeline.  2,4-D, a systemic herbicide, is used on many types of broadleaf weeds.  It is a chlorinated phenoxy compound that has caused serious eye and skin irritation among agricultural workers.  According to information compiled by Cornell University, rats fed 2,4-D produced “fetuses with abdominal cavity bleeding and increased mortality.”  And 2,4-D may cause infertility, birth defects, organ toxicity and neurological effects.",®

Everyone in our department knew it.  Everyone in our neighboring departments knew it.  [I wanted him to know it.](http://i.imgur.com/Nu3uc.jpg)  So, I had recently bought a couple [Phantom Keystrokers](http://www.thinkgeek.com/gadgets/electronic/ae83/) from Thinkgeek.  These clever little devices act as HID interfaces (mouse/keyboard) and do three things: toggle caps-lock, shift the cursor around a little and type some pre-loaded text.  The frequency of these can be modified from 5 seconds to 15 minutes, though in practice that turned out to be about 2 minutes.  It was good enough for my purposes.  Now, after testing it out on my machine to see what the user experience would be like I determined that the cursor wiggling and typing would be too overt, so I turned those off and only had it toggle caps-lock.  Bossman had one of those fancy monitors that has a USB hub built in to it and somehow had figured out how to connect it to the dock he used for his laptop.  He didn't actually use the ports on this monitor, but it was still attached.  I slapped my new best friend into one of the ports, [admired my handiwork](http://i.imgur.com/F7IOx.png) and left.  Every couple weeks I'd poke my head back there to see if it was in place and sure enough, it always was.  It blended in so perfectly with the plastic on the monitor that unless you had the notion to turn the monitor around to stare in the exact spot where it was plugged in, you just wouldn't see it at all.  A couple months later I'm in Bossman's office to have a one-on-one with him and he's finishing up an email or something.  I notice a big bright-green **CAPS ON** flash up on his screen and scarcely missing a beat, his pinky finger flashes out and hits the caps-lock key.  **CAPS OFF**  [He lets out an exasperated sigh and starts dumping his frustrations about his Logitech keyboard and how he has reloaded the drivers and software for it and he just doesn't understand what the problem might be.

Hmm... yes. The world is overrun by legions of people camping outside women's clinics. Hell, when I worked in a hospital, I couldn't get in some days because of the massive crowds of protesters.  You want to keep drawing conclusions about some nebulous group of people (ie ""the religious"") from some randomly selected instances  - mostly from the US?  &gt; Usually once the people meet the ""enemy"" they realise all that's a bunch of horseshit - different coloured people are not that different, gay people are not that different, funny speaking foreigners are not that different etc.  ...and religious people aren't all bigoted, conservative nutjobs.  Your last paragraph works both ways hombre. It's amusing that you're presenting a caricature of religion (based on the worst excesses and internet lore) to prove your point.   The vast majority of people you meet who are religious, will not shove it in your face, will not proselytise about * holy text* and are not looking to recruit innocents to their unholy legion of religious doom™.   That's not denying those people exist. We've all seen old Fred Phelps go off on one of his rants or the ACL come out with some stupid idiocy.  But to indulge in stereotypes and seek to badmouth a worthwhile charity? Shit dude. I don't give a shit what someone's babbling at me when they're giving me a hot meal and a blanket when it's 2 degrees and I've been homeless for five years. And the SA certainly don't perform gaydar screenings of people who turn up in need.  Does it take religion to make people do good things? Yes and no. People help for a whole range of reasons, and if it takes the tooth fairy to get people to help the less fortunate, then so be it.   And yes... something that you consider to be just as ridiculous as the tooth fairy, gets some people to go out on a 2 degree night and serve soup.   I fully concede that others just do it for purely secular reasons.  The unfortunate thing is that your attitude of someone who's ""sticking it to the man"" by telling others to not support the SA.   Mate, **any** SA member who believes their shit would be **applauding** the fact that you're still donating, still helping out your fellow human being and doing your bit to alleviate a bit of the suffering that makes this world miserable sometimes. Donate to the Red Cross? Brilliant. Donate to MSF? Awesome.   It's not some sort of game, where the SA tracks it's revenue against St Vinnies and there's a prize at the end of the year. When they ask for more money, it's because they see a need and are trying to do something to alleviate the problems they face. You think they wail because Anglicare got to that needy family first?  The thing that would shit an SA person, would be if you were to **not ** make that donation to an alternate good cause. So our friend earlier in the thread who bragged about telling everyone not to give money to the Salvos at the pub, must ask themselves how much of those potential donations ended up in a pool table, pokie machine or buying an unnecessary pint instead of something worthwhile for the needy.

We'd decided we were in it for the long haul, so I was sponsoring her, but it was a long process.   1 year into the L-D part of the relationship , I was sure. I had asked her for ring size a long time ago, so I could surprise her, but she ABSOLUTELY failed at measuring her hand. She gave an wildly inaccuratesize. Like an R. that’s a UK sizing for GODDAMNED MASSIVE. this caused me to have the size converted when looking for rings and have a lot of trouble finding rings that could be resized to that point. I guess that is one excuse I have for not realizing I was buying a goddamned hoola hoop.   Anyways, I run around Vancouver trying to find a ring in this size. I had in my head a ring we’d seen on a wonderful trip to Vienna together, when I was there for work and she was able to meet me there from the UK. It was an antique, and very yellow gold, with a three stone setting, but understated, and she loved it. I made the mistake of not getting it that time. But yellow gold and three stone settings are not all created equal.   So I finally found a ring that was proportionate to Shrek, and it’s gold and three stone, so I get it. It’s huge. I don’t think. I just get something which I think will be right, and reminded me of my ever fuzzier memory of this other ring. Seriously this thing was massive. It could be mistaken for a wrestling championship belt. And ugly.   So I take this massive ring in its massive box and get on a plane for a planned trip to see her at her parents place near London. We had planned a trip to a manor, where we’d visited the first time I came to England. It was my plan to propose then and there., on a nearby field where we’d had a picnic.  BUT IT WAS CLOSED.   I found out the day before, so I am at a loss. We look at other trips to take. Everything is closed or not really right. And I only had 4 days left in the country.   So my gf mentions she promised that she would visit and help out her friend’s horses. I’d been there before and it was in the English country side. It was beautiful and sunny and pastoral. I thought it would work.   So I hid my massive ring box in my Gore-Tex jacket, despite not a cloud in the sky, and say “I just like having a jacket”. We get to the place, it’s a beautiful place. It’s a great day.   We proceed to muck out the stalls. For over half an hour, we are raking out horseshit. And I am getting more nervous. There’s no chance in my mind to delay this, I will propose. When we’re done, I ask if we can take a walk. She thinks it odd, especially as I take my jacket. We go up the hill, and at the first clearing, stumbling, I trip over my hastily prepared lines, and show her a ring box the size of my fist and open it to reveal a clusterfuck of a ring the size of a bracelet.   It was not my finest moment.   We go shopping for a proper ring the next day, and show it off to her family.  I returned the Shrek ring ™ for our wedding bands, and it’s a funny story now. All good.

No one is disputing this.  The difference is that Valve actually appears to give a shit about its customers. All that data that they collect about programs you're running? You're right. [They publish that publicly.](http://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey) There's no one left wondering where that data goes, what they know about us, and so on. It's all right there, and you can decline its collection on your system if you so choose. All of these are signs that Valve views its customers as humans, humans with questions and with fears. The same cannot be said for EA et al.  Reddit is against DRM, yes. Steam is a form of DRM, yes. You need an internet connection to play some games, yes. These are all valid criticisms of Steam as a platform, and they are not in dispute. The difference, however, is that Steam is about as unobtrusive as it gets for DRM. No rootkits, no CD checks, no spyware. All that Valve asks is that you sign in to your account to play the game. Most of the time, that's all you need to do. Apologies if your internet has gone out, but that event is an edge case for Valve's always-on, broadband-enabled user base. And if signing into an account to play is too much for you, you may as well start viewing any game with a login as being too deeply encumbered by DRM.  Moreover, Steam is an internet distribution platform. It's a very safe assumption that its users will have internet. If your particular use case includes long periods of non-connectivity, why did you opt for an internet distribution platform in the first place? Why not buy the disc? The internet connectivity requirement isn't a surprise to anyone.  I could go on as well, but I'm hoping you see how reddit isn't just giving a pass to Valve. We know what we're compromising on here. For the things that reddit typically doesn't abide, such as DRM, Valve has chosen a rational and unobtrusive method to accomplish their goals. Valve also has a long history of legitimately responding to and evolving from customer complaints, and they tend to Make Things Right™ more often than not.  Reddit's appreciation for good customer service - transparency, rationality, humanity - really does go deep.

t5_2qh2z,giantsparklerobot,1326841220,"That article has some problems because it doesn't bother mentioning radiative surface area. A fictional spaceship that wants to effectively radiate heat from it's internal machinery needs to maximize it's radiative surface area and minimize it's receptive surface area. I'll try to illusted this with ASCII below:                          (ship)                          |____ --&gt;     ☀ - (sunlight) -&gt;   |____ --&gt; (radiation)                          |____ --&gt;  In my crappy illustration above our space ship has a receptive surface area of 3 units but a radiative surface area of 9 units. Assuming some sort of perfect conduction our ship can radiate three times as much energy as it receives from the star. If the ship generates twice as much heat as it receives from the star it should be able to radiate all of its heat away so it doesn't melt into slag. The sunward side of the ship can furl radiators and close insulated and reflective doors to absorb as little sunlight as possible and the dark side can unfurl radiators and open up the insulated doors to radiate like a son of a bitch.  Now most sci-fi ships don't take this sort of design into account so they have roughly the same sized area receiving sunlight as they do radiating it back into space. Ships look cooler when they aren't practically designed. However space is pretty damned cold and heat will flow very quickly in a shadowed area because the differential between room temperature (~300K) and empty space (~3K) is huge.  That's not necessarily to say the link is *wrong* but not as accurate as it could be. You would not want to be caught unprotected in the shadow of something in space, you'll get really cold really fast.",☀

t5_2sokd,Zeesev,1326853956,"When you record the temperature, you are recording the amount of heat energy in an object or system. In the following Lets Pretend™ exercise, imagine that the difference in temperature between two objects is represented by a pile of rocks.   The rules: You have gathered volunteers to help pick up the rocks. As a rule, each person can only hold one rock at a time. If they have a rock, the only way they can get rid of it is if they give it to someone who doesn't already have one, and it takes a full minute to give a rock away after it has been picked up. If you want to imagine different temperatures of air, just imagine that a % of people didn’t understand why they were asked to show up and brought their own rocks from home.   No wind chill: If all the people are standing around the pile of rocks, not moving, then the only way to shrink the pile of rocks will be to have the people who are closest pick up rocks, wait a minute, hand it off, pick up another, wait, hand it off, and so on.   Wind chill: Now imagine the crowd of people is moving, so that the people next to the pile are constantly changing. As each person walks/runs by the pile of rocks they can pick one up. When the crowd is moving, the rate at which the pile of rocks shrinks is not limited by how long it takes for a person to pass a rock to someone else; it is now limited by how many people per minute pass by the pile of rocks.   The point where the pile of rocks is empty would represent the point where two objects are the same temperature, which is called being in thermal equilibrium. Notice: it doesn't matter how quickly you reach the bottom of the pile of rocks, once you reach the bottom there are no more rocks to be transferred. This is why if the air is 40 degrees, your thermometer will read 40 degrees whether the wind is blowing at 10 or 10,000 mph.  Your body perceives temperature as the rate at which heat is transferring into or away from your body. If it is 40 degrees F out with no wind chill, all you feel is the 40 degree air slowly taking heat away from your skin and transferring it to the air around it. At this rate it is said that it feels like the air is 40 degrees F (because it is). When the wind starts blowing, however, the rate at which the 40 degree air is removing heat from your body increases as the velocity of the air increases.   Imagine two crowds, each surrounding the same sized rock pile. In one crowd, let’s call it crowd A, 40% of the people brought rocks from home, and in the other crowd, crowd B, only 20% brought rocks from home. If crowd A moves together past the pile at a quick enough pace, they will be able to remove rocks from the pile just as fast as crowd B standing still. Likewise, If the air is 40 degrees, and the wind is blowing at a rate where the temperature with wind chill is said to be 20 degrees, this means that if you were to go outside in the wind it would feel the same as if the air were 20 degrees with no wind.   Sorry if I have any major derps above, I didn't proofread.   That said, these and similar concepts are characterized in the fields of thermodynamics, fluid dynamics, and kinetics. These are actually all incredibly complicated subjects, and if any young-ins are interested in this type of stuff you should consider a career in chemical engineering. ",™

t5_2qxih,Slowburns,1326990481,"**Copy/Pastega as it appears the site is down:**  Hello everyone! We appreciate you joining us to play Star Wars™: The Old Republic™, and we hope you enjoy the game. As MMORPGs are large and complex projects, inevitably we do discover issues that may affect gameplay. We're working constantly to fix anything that will affect the player experience, but for now this is our current list of high priority in-game known issues.    This list of known issues was last updated on: January 18th, 2012  **Players may experience a brief loading screen when other players spawn nearby.**  **Anti-aliasing is currently disabled for ATI 6900 series graphics cards.**  **Holograms will disappear during conversations if players modify their preferences to turn off bloom while anti-aliasing is on.**   For the Trooper mission ""Inconspicuous Valor,"" the mission step ""Speak to General Garza"" may not update if players take the shuttle from the Republic Fleet to Coruscant.   Workaround: Players should enter their personal spaceship and use it to travel to Coruscant rather than taking the shuttle.    Sixteen-player Operations groups who wipe when attempting to defeat the fourth boss in Karagga’s Palace on Hard/Nighmare Mode will be unable to attempt the fight ""G4-B3 Heavy Fabricator"" again until the Operation resets.   Workaround: Players are able to manually reset the Operation and begin again: right click character portrait &gt; Phase &gt; Reset All Active Operations.    When grouped with another character of your same class and while inside a Class Phase, looting may request players to roll for loot rather than giving it to the player automatically. This happens most often when group members are not within the proper proximity to be eligible for the items. Note that the window may require more than one roll attempt, but the appropriate player will receive the loot after about 30 seconds.   The loading screen that prompts ""Press spacebar to continue"" will not function properly if the command for ""Jump"" has been remapped to another key in player preferences.    Workaround: If the command is not bound, players will need to exit the game using Alt+F4 or by pressing Ctrl+Alt+Delete to pull up the Task Manager. Upon returning to the game, players will need to bind the jump key. Players should use the remapped key to progress when at the loading screen.   Player groups are not currently able to have more than one active Flashpoint. If your group has recently entered a Flashpoint and attempts to enter a different Flashpoint, players will see a message prompt. The message will incorrectly state that you cannot enter because of a different difficulty selection, but it is actually because the first Flashpoint is still active.  Workaround: The group leader must right click on his or her portrait and select reset all active Flashpoints from the context menu. Then you should be able to enter. Note that you can only reset Flashpoints once every 5 minutes. If the party leader recently reset, players will need to wait for the timer or leave the group and create it again using a different leader before resetting the active Flashpoint from the context menu.   If you installed prior to 5:00AM CST on January 4th, 2012, your graphics will display as ""Low"" even if actual in-game settings are higher due to automatic preference detection.  Workaround: Your graphics setting will display properly once modified and saved.  Workaround: Individual preferences will display properly once modified and saved.",™

Although England was  inhabited since the [Upper Paleolithic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_Palaeolithic) (and I did get to see some of it, including London), Mildenhall itself is only - **70 years old** * Kadena Air Base, Okinawa, Japan - (Okinawa has been inhabited since the [Paleolithic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleolithic), but Kadena is only **67 years old**.   * South Korea [Kunsan] (Settled since the [lower paleolithic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_Paleolithic) but the first city established about 4,300 years ago.  Kunsan Air Base is only **61 years old**, making it the youngest ""city"" I lived in.

What you described, however, is topping from below; you wanted him to punish you, which is sort of forcing his hand; that's topping from the bottom. If you want the crop, ask him for it - i'm sure he'll oblige ;-)  But topping from below is sometimes seen as being a 'brat' to act out in order to get what you want. He's the one who's supposed to be in control. However, discussing things with him is a great way to lay out how you want this new direction to unfold. Challenging one's Dominant is something i think we all do; i do it when i feel i'm not being controlled tightly enough and He knows when i do it, how to ramp things up for me. It's normal, it's natural, and it's probably expected. But being ""bratty"" (not a judgment just a word used) to get what you want is actually topping HIM, in a way, so yes, tell him what you need, ask him when you want to feel physically controlled, and he'll also learn to look for the signs in you.

t5_2s3yz,neguohsi,1327016895,"Just remember that other people want to talk to you because they like you and like being around you - you have valuable things to say. Even if it seems scary to talk to people in case you mess up, they will always be understanding since they're the ones initiating conversations with you.  Here are some really good ways to become comfortable talking to people: 1. Talk to people who you know are more awkward or shy than you. Since their comfort level is lower than yours, you have the upper hand and can control the conversation. Additionally, you can be sure that they're more worried about themselves and how they sound than they are about how you sound or act. To them, you might be the coolest guy ever! 2. Talk to waiters/servers/cashiers/etc. briefly whenever you need to speak to them. For example, when buying groceries, you can make a comment about the weather or the delicious dinner you're going to cook. Casual, offhand remarks make for very brief conversations - just long enough to scan, pay, and bag your items. Don't forget to say thanks and have a nice day! Everyone appreciates that. 3. Try to ask a lot of questions about the other person. Being a good listener really makes people feel at ease and takes the burden of controlling the conversation off of you. Everyone likes talking about themselves!  Don't worry too much - I used to do the same things as you (I'm a girl btw). Social interaction is all about feeling casual and as though your interactions aren't the epitome of life. If you mess up, play it off with a joke or just ignore it and remember to correct yourself next time. Good luck! I believe in you! ♥",♥
t5_2sgq6,NinjaofLove,1327016916,"All of the Bioware games I've played should carry the Burger King slogan: ""Have It Your Way®.""  No matter what choice you make, good or evil, you're still a rock star who can bang chicks/guys and save/conquer the world. You're glorified no matter what you do. The only thing that suffers if you choose evil is your character's complexion, and the only motivation for being a bad guy is to see how the alternate bad guy scenes play out. To me, this win-win binary model is boring, lazy and unrealistic.   If you go into a prison and interview any inmate, they won't tell you that they were straight A students who one day decided they wanted to be evil to see how things would play out differently. In reality, they probably came from broken homes, were abused, beaten, neglected, etc.  I can't even be bothered with these games anymore. The industry keeps insisting that this is rich, immersive, top notch story-telling, but I think anyone who's ever read a book, watched a good movie... or lived a little would feel otherwise. ",®

t5_2qh2s,shitloadofbooks,1327027561,"**Paradox Glass™**:- *Modern Day (System Neutral)*  *Paradox Glass™* is a transparent material, made from a refined ore found primarily in the South West coast of Africa (Namibia, Botswana).  It has one *very* peculiar property: light travels faster than ***c*** through this material. The result, is that looking through a piece of *Paradox Glass™* allows you to see into the future.  The largest and most refined piece produced so far (about the size of an compact optical disc) allows for a glimpse approximately 19 hours into the future.  Various personal sized and reasonably ""affordable"" pieces (the size of a small coin) allow for glimpses of around 1-2 hours.  The results of the discovery of this material were profound. Firstly, *Causality* and *Pre-Determinism* is basically a proven thing. This has had severe implications on the overall psyche of Mankind, as the feeling of hopelessness and being a slave to ones own actions took hold.   Certain types of people regularly try to break free from this feeling, by doing ""spontaneous"" things (even killing themselves) but of course, this is all perfectly seen and pre-determined, and so their efforts are futile.  The other effect is that Africa's economy has exploded. Unfortunately, government corruption, armed warbands and covert operations from various countries have further destabilized the continent, and so the entire south-western region is under full martial law, with armoured troop carriers patrolling the streets and heavily armed helicoptors and UAVs patrolling the skies.  The compounds around mining sites that are known to produce *Paradox Ore*  are some of the most secure facilities on the planet, with hundreds of armed soldiers regularly patrolling, to protect against theft, but also against radical anti-Paradox organizations that use Terror as part of their campaign against the production and use of *Paradox Glass™*.",™

t5_2rlua,reogin,1327060512,"Here's a ROE for Battlefield 3.. they can call you a ""faggit"" all they want.  1. RULES AND POLICIES FOR TRUSTED PARTNERS / SERVER HOST PROVIDERS Dice and EA are limiting trusted server software distribution to our network of Trusted Partners in order to protect the integrity of the code system. We want everyone to be able to play Ranked Servers if they choose. It is imperative that all of these Rules and Policies be adhered to in order to create a level playing field for everyone.  1.1 Server Configuration  1.1.1 Ranked Servers have a number of settings hard-coded so that users cannot adjust them. These settings are all set as below to keep the competition on Ranked servers balanced across all providers:  minPlayers: 16+ (minimum server size is 16 players)  sv.password = â€œâ€ (empty string - Ranked servers may not be password protected. Ranked servers are intended to be available to all players.)  sv.numPlayersNeededToStart = (6 for 16-31 maxPlayers, 10 for 32-64)  sv.spawnTime 15  sv.manDownTime 15  sv.ticketRatio 100  sv.teamRatioPercent 100  sv.punkBuster 1  1.1.2 Though it is not required, we also request that all servers run Friendly Fire at 100% for all settings, including mines (sv.friendlyFireWithMines).  1.2 Server Content  1.2.1 Ranked servers must be entirely ""pure"" with no customization outside of the default content shipped by DICE/EA. Ranked servers are not allowed to run customised games or Mods, as we cannot ensure the balance of these components.  1.2.2 Whenever there is a new patch released Ranked Partners are required to upgrade their servers.  Ranked servers are not to run upcoming content early nor out of date content.  1.3 Server Access  1.3.1 BF2CC may be used to access and adjust server settings not defined above but hosts must be able to demonstrate that the ranked server code is secure â€“ no FTP access or other direct access to the files is allowed.  1.4 Maps  1.4.1 Custom maps are never permitted on ranked servers, although we do permit map sizes to be defined independently of maximum players.  2. RULES AND POLICIES FOR ALL SERVER ADMINISTRATORS MANAGING RANKED SERVERS (PUBLIC OR PRIVATE) These are rules and policies that all people running ranked servers are expected to observe. Failure to do so can result in the server being delisted.  2.1 Copyright Infringements and Advertising  2.1.1 Server Administrators may not arrange for the exchange or transfer of any pirated software, distribution of copyrighted software or CD keys or other contraband while on any Ranked Servers.  2.1.2 Server Administrators may not market, promote or advertise other services or products on any ranked servers (excluding trusted partners and in game server messages).  2.2 Game Setting Changes  2.2.1 Server Administrators may not change any server settings preset by EA (as listed above).  2.2.2 Server Administrators may not load up custom maps or modifications to Ranked Servers.  2.2.3 TK Punish must be active (i.e. not â€œoffâ€), but can be set to automatically punish or to allow players to punish/forgive by voting.  2.3 â€œIn-Houseâ€ Ranked Server Rules  Public Ranked Servers and Private rented clan servers may introduce custom rules that apply only to their servers and which result in minor changes to gameplay. These â€œin-houseâ€ rules are allowed as long as they do not violate the conditions of use of a ranked server as determined by DICE and EA and as long as they are explicitly announced in the server description or on the loading screen, so that players joining the server are aware of them before they start playing.  2.3.1 Disallowed â€œIn-Houseâ€ Ranked Server Rules:  Server Administrators may not implement or enforce server rules on ranked servers that prohibit players from using any roles, kits, weapons, vehicles or other features of the game while playing on their server. Examples of such rules that would violate the conditions of use are:  (a) Preventing any players from being Commander or Squad Leaders.  (b) Preventing any players from using certain vehicles such as jets, helicopters or tanks.  (c) Preventing any players from using commander assets (artillery, vehicle drop, UAV or scans).  (d) Preventing any players from using certain weapons or items (such as flashbangs or C4) or enforcing a â€œpistol onlyâ€ or â€œknife onlyâ€ server rule.  2.3.2 Allowed â€œIn-Houseâ€ Ranked Server Rules:  Server Administrators may implement and enforce rules that result in minor changes to gameplay behaviour or styles as long as these are clearly stated before a player starts playing on a server. These rules typically introduce minor restrictions on how a certain aspect of the game can be used.  Examples of such rules that are acceptable are:  (a) Players may not use explicit, offensive or racist language in-game.  (b) Players may not impersonate clan members or other server administrators.  (c) Players may not deliberately performing actions that hinder their own team (such as last-minute team-swapping to increase scores or statistics, excessive team-killing, destroying friendly vehicles, attacking team-mates,  deliberately placing themselves in a situation so they cause another player to team-kill them, using a vehicle while being the Commander that prevents them from performing any Commander functions (jet, etc.) or placing vehicles to block their own runways.  (d) Making attacks on enemy main bases (flags that cannot be captured), including artillery strikes, vehicle drops to block runways, bombing runs with aircraft or sustained infantry attacks. (Note that specific attacks targeting the enemy commanderâ€™s asset buildings are always allowed, even if they are within the enemy main base.)  (e) Using transport helicopters to quickly capture all flags with no attempt to engage the other team (flag hopping).  (f) Using C4 explosives on fast-moving vehicles to destroy other vehicles (C4-ramming)  (g) Ignoring requests from Server Administrators or abusing Server Administrators.  3. RULES AND POLICIES APPLYING TO ALL PLAYERS ON RANKED SERVERS. The following rules are ones that players are expected to abide by while playing on ranked servers. Any use of third-party programs or game exploits not listed below should be reported through one of the channels listed below.  3.1 Use of Cheats or Hacks  3.1.1 Players may not change (hack) any core games files or effectively change game settings by employing external programs or cheats for the purposes of giving themselves an unfair advantage over other players. This would include but not limited to:  (a) MSX and other 3rd party software.  (b) Modification of weapons code, aka Tank turrets exploit.  (c) CVAR hacks which would make players appear Neon  (d) CVAR hacks that let players see thru walls or buildings  (e) Mini-Map hack so all players are visible  (f) Modification of Player Names which would alter their size or colors.  3.2 Game Exploits  3.2.1 Players may not use or exploit game mechanisms to artificially boost their score (""stats padding"") and Server administrators may not knowingly allow or encourage this activity on their servers.  This would include but not limited to:  (a) Using tag teams to take turns to kill and revive each other in turn (using knives, pistols, etc.)  (b) Playing on Knife and/or Pistol only Servers  (c) Playing on Knife only Servers  (d) Playing on â€œHigh Pointsâ€ Servers  (e) Playing on â€œNo Artilleryâ€ or â€œNo Armourâ€ Servers (except when using Infantry only server-side option)  (f) Using Vehicles removed from battlefield for purposes of artificially inflating points  (g) Turning boats upside down and constantly repairing them  (h) Glitching inside buildings (using building model glitches to attack out without risk of being hit).  4. REPORTING VIOLATIONS OF THE ROE  Anyone who observes violations of the ROE based upon server rules or player actions should report these violations (with screenshots) as soon as possible.  Any action taken against players or Server Administrators will be taken by EA and may include having ranked servers being delisted (unranked) or having player accounts reset to remove all global points and awards.  Violations (or suspected violations) can be reported to any of the following authorised groups:  EA Support: http://support.ea.com/  Punkbuster: Cheats, hacks or exploits can be reported to research@evenbalance.com",™

t5_2qi58,zSolaris,1327064326,"============= Neuer =============  = Ramos = Vidic = Thiago Silva = Lahm =  === Schweinsteiger ==== D. Fletcher ===  = A. Valencia ==== Rooney ==== Bale =  =========== Van Persie ===========   Bit of an explanation:  * Neuer is a crazy German keeper. And them Germans don't like you scoring on them. He's a brick wall and can launch counterattacks by throwing the ball past the halfway line. * Ramos I picked because he's usually a solid defensive right back. Don't need him to really bombard up the pitch since he won't have the ball often but need him to be solid in defense. * Vidic and Thiago Silva. Does this need to be explained?  * Lahm was picked because he is also a solid fullback while offering a little bit of attacking threat. Could be useful supporting Silva down the left. * Schweinsteiger because every team needs the Pig Climber©. * Darren Fletcher. When he's healthy and in form, he has the ability to take care of some of the best midfielders in the world. His presence and industry were sorely missed by United in both UCL finals.  * Antonio Valencia. He's like a Theo Walcott who can defend and cross properly. Has ridiculous amounts of speed but is also as strong as an ox. Excellent man for when you need a swift break or for when you need to sit deep and defend. * Rooney playing the trequartista that he so excels at. Provided that he doesn't loose his cool, he is perhaps one of the most complete forwards in the game. That is, he can defend, he can win the ball, he can run, he can shoot, he can head it in. Perfect for a game where you will need to sit deep and wait for that one or two chances. * Bale here for more or less the same reasons as Valencia. Good in defense, high work rate, and ridiculously good at counter attacks. * Van Persie. When you need a man to score off of one attempt on goal (or zero), no one is better than RVP. ",©

t5_2qh1i,SharpshooterMcPooper,1327115632,"So this one time, I was playing some Unreal Tournament, when I suddenly felt a tremendous urge to take a shit.  Not wanting to walk away from the match that was currently in progress, I held my poo for about 15 minutes until the match was finally over.  At this point, not only did I need to take a WICKED dump, but I had also developed the urge to pee.  So I figured that I'd pull the ol' Piss'N'Poop™, wherein I would sit on the toilet to shit, and then point my schlong down into the toilet so that I could simultaneously urinate.  As soon as my shit strategy had been coordinated, I ran to the bathroom, slammed the door, and frantically swiped at the wall until I hit the light switch.  *POP!*  Fuck.  The light bulb had blown out.  It was pitch dark and I couldn't see a damned thing, but there was no time to find a new light source.  There was a turd-snake coiled up in my rectum and it was already beginning to pounce.  So I stumbled to the toilet, pulled down my pants, and before my ass even hit the seat, the poo and pee were a'flyin'.  However, when I finally assumed a full sitting position, I realized that there was a problem.  You see, whoever had used the toilet before me had apparently put the whole toilet seat cover down, so I was pooping and peeing on TOP of the toilet rather than IN it.  When I realized this tactical error, I quickly brought myself to my feet and hastily fumbled around with the toilet seat.  In the meantime, I attempted to momentarily halt my poop and pee production, but was only partially successful.  While my anus was sympathetic toward my admittedly foolish dilemma, my urethral sphincter was not quite so forgiving, and my pee stream continued to spring forth as I desperately tried to correct the toilet seat configuration.  In my panicked state, correcting the orientation of the toilet seat took several seconds longer than it normally would have.  By the time I finally placed the toilet seat into an appropriate configuration and sat down again, everything around me was drenched in pee.  And although the darkness prevented me from witnessing the full extent of the carnage, I was fairly certain that there was at least one turd that had failed to enter the toilet bowl.  When I finally finished my business, I wiped my arse, shamefully pulled up my pee-soaked pants, and trudged my way out of the bathroom.  I returned several moments later with a flashlight to survey all of the damage.  Odd.  There was a small pool of pee surrounding the toilet, but no poo to be found anywhere.  I guess all of the poo had somehow gone into the toilet after all.  I left the bathroom again to retrieve some heavy duty paper towels, when I suddenly felt something stirring inside of my pants, followed by the sensation that something was crawling down my leg.  I instinctively shook my leg, and lo and behold, out popped a small turdlette from the bottom of my pant leg.  Yes, somehow during the calamity, a rogue turd had found its way into the seat of my pants, where it remained lodged until the motions of my walking set it free.  I used a paper towel to collect the turd, and I manually deposited into the toilet.  Long story short, don't poop in the dark.",™

t5_2rjo5,mrbabymanv4,1327231123,"Are you using a Mac or a PC?  Do you have a suitable microphone?  What is the model of this audio interface you have?  I think you might have an Avid® Recording Studio. This is not ideal if you want somewhat professional sounding stuff, but it is adequate to learn on before you go ahead. It has a built in-preamp on one of its inputs.   **SOUND SOURCE**  An input is where you can plug a sound source into, such as microphones, synths(input 2), electric guitars (with DI box). BTW I am assuming you are a beginner to all this. We will go through the signal chain to give your an understanding on how to get a decent sound.  **PREAMP STAGE**  With your microphone plugged in and a signal passing through, it must first go through the preamp in order to ""boost"" the low signal into a stronger, louder signal. A good preamp which can gain a signal well improves the signal chain drastically. Ones to look out for are FMR RNP and GAP PRE73.  **COMP**  This can be added if you get an external preamp. Makes loud parts softer. People use this to attenuate high amplitude signals by a certain ratio, than gain the overall signal to make signal seem louder. Not always necessary in studio recording. Look out for FMR RNC.   **A/D STAGE**  This stage is where the analogue signal gets ""turned into"" digital data that your computer can read. Your interface has built in AD, but it is not of the highest quality.  **DAW STAGE**  Into your DAW or sequencer. This is where you get to see your recorded signal as a waveform. I do not use ProTools SE, but it should be fairly easy to record and sequence with one you get past the learning curve. If not, people who use reaper rave about its ease of use.  **D/A STAGE**  Digital back to analogue so your monitors (speakers) can output your processed signal (Can use unprocessed signal if experiencing lag when recording).   If you are trying to get a good sound, have a good signal chain. For now, you can buy a SM57 or 58, you will need one of these anyways, they are cheap, built well and nice for recording instruments and male vocals.  Connect this to your audio interface with a balanced XLR microphone cable to your main input.  Connect your speaker system to the outputs (don't buy new speakers yet). If using RCA or unbalanced keep the cable lengths short, or pickup hum and buzz.  Connect interface to PC via usb (not a big fan of this, but usb2 speeds should be okay).  Install the drivers for your interface.  Next step is to set up your DAW. Reply back if you have questions for this.   If you are thinking of upgrading later, I set up a friend's bang for buck setup with a SM57s/SM7 -- GAP pre73(used) -- FMR RNC -- RME fireface400(used- got it for a steal)  -- to his PC -- bm6a. He has recorded himself and some bands with this setup, and is very happy with the results. Upgrade based on your needs though, don't get caught up in buying shit and then never acquiring the expertise to use it well (I feel this happens a lot).  Good luck mate.",®

t5_2qmg3,JohnMaddenNovelty,1327268340," **John Madden Halftime Report**  Brought to you by *Butterball* © *turkeys*  Both teams have had plenty opportunities to score, and neither have outperformed this half. The second half will be especially hard for the Ravens because of this crowd. It is a sold out crowd and they are really getting into it. Of the fifty-two states in this country, this one has one of the loudest stadiums in Gillette. The goal for the Ravens in the second half is to quiet the crowd quick with some solid defense and some scoring by Joe.  Speaking of Joe Flacco, he is having a game. There have been some mistakes, but he is showing that he is better than people give him credit for. He threw for 162 yards in 16 attempts. Almost 70% passing. He is trying to score touchdowns so he can get points and lead his team to the Super Bowl. In order for the Ravens to continue to ball so hard, they need to play football hard. Scoring is the key, and Ray Rice needs to step it up and help out in that department. Ray Rice only has 21 yards in 10 carries.   Rarely is the question asked, 'is our Patriots winning?' This is because the Patriots have Tom Brady. The first half of this match he threw for 146 yards. 14 out of his 24 attempts. It's a little under 60%, which is lower than Flaccos 70%. He also threw one interception. If he wants to lead his team to the Super Bowl, Tom cannot throw interceptions. He needs to complete passes and not drop the ball. Hernandez and Welker both have over 40 yards, which is good, but they both have 4 and 3 receptions respectively. Tom needs to find his top receivers if he wants to keep his small lead.   The Ravens have to turn this game around 360 degrees if they want to get a better outcome. The best way for them to do this is to play solid defense, score when they are on offense, and make no mistakes. They are only down 3 points, but against the Patriots, you need to have more points if you want to win. ",©

""Mother would take blocks of American cheese, jars of Miracle Whip, and cans of pimentos, sit under the post oaks and grind them together with a clamp-on-the-table meat grinder."" That's how pimento cheese was made in Patrick's family. This version started out pretty much the way Patrick's mother's did, with pimentos and mayonnaise but Cheddar and Jack rather than American cheese. Then, feeling the pimentos were not as tasty as they once might have been, we switched to thick, jarred Spanish peppers and bolstered the mix with smoked paprika, along with plenty of pepper and a little mustard.

t5_2rnuq,TheScriptKiddie,1327271576,"A few minor points/corrections:   * **FOOD:** Unfortunately, I think that even your estimate of 160 people is a bit high. Assuming each individual gets an acre to farm on, the island could support as many as 130, but due to the limited usefulness of the hilly terrain, I would estimate closer to 60 people. Greenhouses might improve this. You simply aren't going to be able to raise animals, but fishing is an option.  * **WATER:** The average human uses around 44 cubic meters of water per year. On a bad year, the average square meter of land in the Philippines gets a little under 1 cubic meter of rainfall. There needs to be 44 square meters of roof space catching rain for each person, which happens to be about double the size of a small apartment. Islands can also have wells and desalinization plants.  * **HEALTH:** This is a tough one. Helicopters to the mainland?  * **COMMUNICATIONS:** Communications are a bit of a game-killer for islands. If it's close to shore, a [FSO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Space_Optics) or microwave link would suffice. Satellite internet could provide [good speed for a reasonable price](http://www.engadget.com/2012/01/08/viasat-residential-satellite-broadband-internet-hands-on-video/), but latency is high. I don't see buried fiber ever being cost-effective.  * **ELECTRICITY:** In the south pacific, you would only need about $25k worth of panels to power a family of four, depending on their air conditioning usage. Coincidentally, if the southern-facing half of the aforementioned 44 square meter roof was covered in panels, it would provide the energy needs of one (1) Average American™ (not accounting for battery losses, other restrictions may apply). Solar panels are guaranteed to 80% capacity after 30 years, so replacements would be needed far less often. Batteries don't last nearly as long, though. Wind turbines are also great, assuming there aren't too many hurricanes. I wouldn't worry about corrosion, stainless steel and aluminum are tougher than you think.  * **WASTE:** Virtually all organic waste can be composted, [including the brown stuff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composting_toilet). Anything not compostable should probably be [gasified to supplement power generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasification), with the exception of metal that could be recycled or sold as scrap. Grey water could be used to flush toilets and water plants, and black water could be put into a septic tank to break down and filter into the sea. If all 130 residents generated 2 kg of waste per day, they could keep [one of these](http://gekgasifier.com/gasification-store/gasifier-genset-skids/) running for 10 hours a day, and produce 12% of their energy needs.  * **SECURITY:** This part scares me. At sea, piracy is, in fact, a problem. The island would need cameras and radar to see people coming, and some form on non-lethal weaponry to deter theft and vandalism. I have no idea how policing/justice would be handled. Also, storm shelters would be a must-have. If made strong enough, they might also serve as scary-man-with-gun shelters.  * **MONEY:** Face it, tourism and fishing are going to be the main sources of income. If a fast enough internet connection can be brought in, there is also an opportunity operate a *literally offshore* datacenter. There might be certain advantages to that.",™

Greenwald has [the goods:](http://www.salon.com/2011/12/31/progressives_and_the_ron_paul_fallacies/singleton/)  &gt;The fallacy in this reasoning is glaring. The candidate supported by progressives — President Obama — himself holds heinous views on a slew of critical issues and himself has done heinous things with the power he has been vested. He has slaughtered civilians — Muslim children by the dozens — not once or twice, but continuously in numerous nations with drones, cluster bombs and other forms of attack. He has sought to overturn a global ban on cluster bombs. He has institutionalized the power of Presidents — in secret and with no checks — to target American citizens for assassination-by-CIA, far from any battlefield. He has waged an unprecedented war against whistleblowers, the protection of which was once a liberal shibboleth. He rendered permanently irrelevant the War Powers Resolution, a crown jewel in the list of post-Vietnam liberal accomplishments, and thus enshrined the power of Presidents to wage war even in the face of a Congressional vote against it. His obsession with secrecy is so extreme that it has become darkly laughable in its manifestations, and he even worked to amend the Freedom of Information Act (another crown jewel of liberal legislative successes) when compliance became inconvenient.  &gt;He has entrenched for a generation the once-reviled, once-radical Bush/Cheney Terrorism powers of indefinite detention, military commissions, and the state secret privilege as a weapon to immunize political leaders from the rule of law. He has shielded Bush era criminals from every last form of accountability. He has vigorously prosecuted the cruel and supremely racist War on Drugs, including those parts he vowed during the campaign to relinquish — a war which devastates minority communities and encages and converts into felons huge numbers of minority youth for no good reason. He has empowered thieving bankers through the Wall Street bailout, Fed secrecy, efforts to shield mortgage defrauders from prosecution, and the appointment of an endless roster of former Goldman, Sachs executives and lobbyists. He’s brought the nation to a full-on Cold War and a covert hot war with Iran, on the brink of far greater hostilities. He has made the U.S. as subservient as ever to the destructive agenda of the right-wing Israeli government. His support for some of the Arab world’s most repressive regimes is as strong as ever.  ☹bama is an insane disaster that no supporter can defend and for whom no informed voter could bring him/herself to cast a vote.",☹

What I suggest is that some parts of the profiles could apply to most people, a characteristic shared by other kinds of readings such as astrological or psychic readings. I do not claim that any profile, taken as a whole, will fit most people. I am not suggesting that one type fits all. Since the various profiles are based on information the client has provided, they shouldn't be telling the customer anything about himself that he doesn't already know. Thus, just as psychics have many satisfied customers because they feed back to clients what the clients have told them, and they make claims that could apply to most people or that most people would want to be true, so too do Myers-Briggs folks have many satisfied customers.

t5_2tf16,mpiet14,1327330275,"*Abstract:*    **Background:** Malignant brain cancer persists as a major disease of morbidity and mortality in adults and is the second leading cause of cancer death in children. Many current therapies for malignant brain tumors fail to provide long-term management because they ineffectively target tumor cells while negatively impacting the health and vitality of normal brain cells. In contrast to brain tumor cells, which lack metabolic flexibility and are largely dependent on glucose for growth and survival, normal brain cells can metabolize both glucose and ketone bodies for energy. This study evaluated the efficacy of KetoCal®, a new nutritionally balanced high fat/low carbohydrate ketogenic diet for children with epilepsy, on the growth and vascularity of a malignant mouse astrocytoma (CT-2A) and a human malignant glioma (U87-MG).   **Methods:** Adult mice were implanted orthotopically with the malignant brain tumors and KetoCal® was administered to the mice in either unrestricted amounts or in restricted amounts to reduce total caloric intake according to the manufacturers recommendation for children with refractory epilepsy. The effects KetoCal® on tumor growth, vascularity, and mouse survival were compared with that of an unrestricted high carbohydrate standard diet.    **Results:** KetoCal® administered in restricted amounts significantly decreased the intracerebral growth of the CT-2A and U87-MG tumors by about 65% and 35%, respectively, and significantly enhanced health and survival relative to that of the control groups receiving the standard low fat/high carbohydrate diet. The restricted KetoCal®  diet reduced plasma glucose levels while elevating plasma ketone body (β-hydroxybutyrate) levels. Tumor microvessel density was less in the calorically restricted KetoCal® groups than in the calorically unrestricted control groups. Moreover, gene expression for the mitochondrial enzymes,  β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase and succinyl-CoA: 3-ketoacid CoA transferase, was lower in the tumors than in the contralateral normal brain suggesting that these brain tumors have reduced ability to metabolize ketone bodies for energy.   **Conclusion:** The results indicate that KetoCal® has anti-tumor and anti-angiogenic effects in experimental mouse and human brain tumors when administered in restricted amounts. The therapeutic effect of KetoCal® for brain cancer management was due largely to the reduction of total caloric content, which reduces circulating glucose required for rapid tumor growth. A dependency on glucose for energy together with defects in ketone body metabolism largely account for why the brain tumors grow minimally on either a ketogenic-restricted diet or on a standard-restricted diet. Genes for ketone body metabolism should be useful for screening brain tumors that could be targeted with calorically restricted high fat/low carbohydrate ketogenic diets. This preclinical study indicates that restricted KetoCal® is a safe and effective diet therapy and should be considered as an alternative therapeutic option for malignant brain cancer.",®

t5_2qh1a,karper,1327353075,"Thanks for articulating that! Most of your points are valid. I usually say that the biggest fault with kde is that it makes you expect a lot more of it than it can deliver. I'll give two examples (in what follows, s/kde/kdesc/g):  * Modules: Non-kde users (and maybe some kde users, too) may not realize this, but kde is huge. Calling any other project equivalent to kde is like calling, say, Russia and Iceland countries. Technically true, but jeez, look at the size difference!  KDE has all these nice modules like kdegames (a 40-game module!), kdeedu (education-related apps), kdemultimedia, kdenetwork, etc. And as if that's not enough, there's kde extragear, a collection of a not inconsiderable number of applications that release separately from kde. You really come to expect a lot more than kde can deliver. I'd expect that kdenetwork comes with everything I will ever need to mess with networky things. I expect that kdemultimedia will ship with all the tools that I will need to play, edit and create multimedia. I expect that kdegraphics would basically be the end-all module for displaying, managing, editing images and photos.  Alas! Unreasonable expectations. Apart from kdegames, and maybe kdeedu (if you insist), none of these modules live up to your expectations from them. They're all full of powerful programs that are a joy to use, but they aren't the swiss knife modules I expect them to be. Some of these could be fixed; kdemultimedia would be vastly improved if someone manages to provide the definitive™ gui frontend to expose mplayer and mencoder's capabilities. Besides, none of the flagship programs are in these modules. k3b, amarok, kile, digikam, all of these are in extragear. I get that they release independently, but would it kill them to align with the kde release? They don't have to change things every six months. I'd be happy with stable versions of these applications that changed little over even an year or two.  * Plasma: A shell that's ridiculously configurable? You don't say! With one setting, it can transform from a netbook interface to a desktop interface? And there are [six interfaces](http://i.imgur.com/JBbwB.png) that ship by default? Can't wait to use it!  I expect plasma to be so fluid. Everything from the name to the glossy artwork suggests that I'll be able to drag, rotate and zoom with abandon. Moving/resizing widgets around is expected to be as fluid as moving windows around. I liked your example of the widget explorer. It's freaking pretty and you expect it to do shit when you just start typing.  Alas! Not-really-unreasonable expectations, but plasma is not there yet. It deserves insane props for being what it is, but all the coolness just sets me up to expect more from it. Moving/resizing widgets around isn't remotely smooth on anything but the fastest of desktops. Dragging widgets to and from a panel, for instance, isn't fluid either. I'd imagine its namesake enters and exits containments more gracefully. Has anyone tried dragging a widget between screens (monitors)? It's not effortlessly pretty. How about trying to configure a widget in one's dashboard? The config window makes you fall back out of the dashboard.  So, kde, here's why I/we love you: you aim for the stars. Unfortunately, sometimes, all it ends up doing is disappointing me/us when you miss. Still, I'm so so glad that you haven't given up and continue to try.",™

Since the early 1990s, Social Stories™ have been suggested to positively affect the social development of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Despite much research, there remains uncertainty regarding the effectiveness of this modality. We conducted a systematic review of the literature using pre-deﬁned, rigorous methods. Studies were considered eligible if they were controlled trials evaluating Social Stories™ among persons with ASD. Two reviewers independently screened articles for inclusion, applied eligibility criteria, extracted data, and assessed methodological quality. A qualitative analysis was conducted on six eligible controlled trials. Five of the six trials showed statistically signiﬁcant beneﬁts for a variety of outcomes related to social interaction.

t5_2qh16,hostergaard,1327427174,"&gt;What? I don't want to be strict: pirates don't produce anything, period.  No, but what you want is irrelevant. Hollywood does not produce anything in the sense that they not make anything physical and necessary to our survival. But if you take the more than just that into consideration you will also have to accept that pirates provide knowledge and spread information to people who would otherwise not have gotten it.    To understand how invaluable this is you must understand the value of free flow of information. When we see a revolution in knowledge, the reaching of this new level is always closely tied to information being more freely available.   &gt;First, ""helping"" someone against their wishes is wrong,   No, its not wrong if it also helps others that want and need the help.   &gt;second, Hollywood can exist without pirates, but pirates can't exist without Hollywood. This is the flaw in your analogies. That these analogies are accurate in different ways doesn't negate this fatal flaw that makes the relationship parasitic.  False, this is the flaw in *your* analogies. Pirates would exist irrespective of Hollywood. They do not need Hollywood, pirates exist because there is a flawed and obsolete system in place, as such they will exist as long as this system is in place. Now, this system is in part enforced by Hollywood so in that respect pirates exist because of Hollywood. But people will always share regardless of law. Its more accurate to say that Hollywood is the parasite, or the sickness, pirates are simply an evolutionary response.   There is two truths; people want to produce knowledge and people want knowledge.  Now, Hollywood produces knowledge, put they only provide it to a limited amount and limits people ability to get it. Pirates are a simple necessity arising from the need for knowledge. People will always want knowledge, and whoever try to stop them from gaining it will sooner or later be crushed.   One of your problems is that you cannot think outside your indoctrinated box that say that you can own knowledge. Before it was true that knowledge was limited, its spread was costly and difficult, but reality have changed. Adapt or die.   &gt;False, that's not how copyright works. Educate yourself. It is how patents work, but MAFIAA and their laws are not concerned with patents in the slightest.  True, its how copyright works, if I produce a work identical to another I cannot publish it regardless. Educate yourself and post your own opinion instead of a large text that you think is too long for me to bother with.  &gt;False, copyright doesn't prevent you from creating something if your inner self is ""tainted"" by certain experiences, you are being ridiculous.  Again you fail to understand the argument. As child I watched Mickey Mouse. I grew up with Disney. Now, my basis for creativity is derived from Disney. To use the article you provided, no movie, book, image song or is free of ""Color"". When someone make a story they use the experience they have, the things they learned to create the story. The bits are all colored and rearranged. And I cannot express them because they are colored.   For example, I think up my own movie with Mickey Mouse. But Mickey is copyrighted. So I have to either not use Mickey at all, which leave me with an imperfect presentation of my thoughts and ideals or I have to not do it all. So I cannot express myself to the fullest, my freedom is limited and for that alone we should cast of the shackles of copyright.  &gt;There are edge cases, like, at some point a fanfic (which is allowed) can turn into blatant retelling of the original, but I don't see how the existence of such edge cases can be used to defend torrenting a video without any changes whatsoever.  No, these are not edge cases. This the very core of the problem. Or one of them at least. That I cannot freely express my toughs.   &gt;How a new model is ""better"" if it can't rise to prominence on its own, without requiring the old model to be utterly destroyed first? Why don't you start your own recording label that uses a ""better"" business model and outcompete the existing labels? Why in order to ""compete"" do you need to destroy them by changing legislation in a way that violates the idea that they are based on, that if a customer doesn't agree to your price, they don't get the goods? If customers can use your stuff regardless then it's no longer a Free Market, you know.  Because is not allowed to rise on it own, the old system is trying legislate it away. All I ask is that we remove legislation that favor one system over the other. Because the idea the legislation are based on are no longer true.  Its no longer the free marked when you have to create laws that prevents certain system from existing.  Its quite simple, copyright is an extension of the idea of ownership. The idea that comes from the fact we both cannot have that rock at the same time. So we make rules as to when and why we can have that rock. But this fundamental truth is no longer true for knowledge. We both can have that rock at the same time. We can have as many of them as we wish for no cost.   An items cost is derived from the labor it takes to produce and the resources it takes to produce it. But its worth is derived from the availability, and the availability is infinite in this case.   No matter how much money and time someone uses to produce something it gives them no right to profit from it. You could spend billions painting the moon but I would still not give you dime for looking at it. You could produce all the oxygen you want but you are not entitled to money for it.   Its a simple reality that things can be copied in endless amounts.  Its very idea they are based on that is wrong. We don't need it, why should we try to legislate it away and sacrifice our freedom for something that is no longer necessary.  The point is that I want Free, but we no longer need Market. We don't need it anymore, you know.  &gt;Then why don't you buy a single book, a single song and a single movie and ""consume them ad infinitum"" instead of pirating?   But I do. I have lots of books I read again and again.  &gt;Oh wait, there is a fundamental difference between consuming identical loaves of bread every day and consuming identical copies of a book. It's a fundamental property of information, in fact, that copying a number doesn't produce any information (which is why copying is free). My analogy is correct, yours is wrong.  No, buddy, your analogy is incorrect, its mine that is valid. Consuming identical books or bread is the same, the problem the same. It will nourish you, but it will end up stale and boring the long run. Copying will create information by spreading it and thus let it evolve.    Instead of only Bread© and Bread With Raisins© we can have thousands of variations that will emerge when we release it from the shackles of copyright.   &gt;I gather that you might be very surprised by the suggestion that it's you who doesn't understand at all how information is different from physical objects, and not the people who you usually accuse of that, those pesky proponents of ""artificial scarcity"". Well, you really have been wrong all this time, deal with it.  I find it sad that you are so blind to simple reality and dismiss it with ridicule because it threatens your obsolete worldview.   &gt;Ha ha ha, dude, really. We are talking about music and movies.  Yes, that we are, you should have remembered that before you started talking about bread and bakers.  ",©

It can be downright depressing, and it will easily get the better of you if you let it.  Some tips that may help you (coming from someone who spent a very long and very hard year to get that first post-college job):  * If there's a particular job/career you're passionate about getting, target jobs along that path and be relentless about applying and interviewing.  * Depending on what your degree/experience/target job is, any sort of portfolio or work samples you can give can go a LONG ways in helping your chances of landing a job.  * If you feel interviews are going poorly, read up on ways you can improve your interview skills.  Blogs, articles, job hunting sites, etc, can offer a lot of tips/insight that you've never even thought about.  Books like ""How to Win Friends and Influence People"" are great, too.  * If you don't like where you live now, apply outside of your geographic area.  Again, I don't know what your skills are or what sort of job you're looking for, but many companies will help with relocation expenses, and this is (quite literally) your ticket out of there.  * ""Professional Job Hunter"" is your career right now, and work as hard at it as you would any other job.  It's not an easy job, but you may find this mindset can help keep you motivated.  Good luck, and don't give up!  This is your life - it's important.

In the public sector the money to cover paychecks and benefits are the result of tax dollars taken off the top of money a private sector business AND a private sector employee receives. You cannot include the taxes on public sector employees because that is in effect double taxation.  The second thing one must understand is the term “collective bargaining” and what it really represents in Wisconsin. If you want to be a public employee in Wisconsin you do not have a choice of whether you want to become a member of the union or not, you must become a member of the Union and pay union dues no matter that you may not want too. As in the case of one union employee whose union dues were used by the union for what she called “smear add campaigns” against her husband who was running for public office. That is not collective bargaining it is extortion. Freedom of association is a constitutional right and Unions are in breach of that Constitutional right. Another aspect of the so called “collective bargaining” process in Wisconsin is that the union dues are collected by the state and then transferred to the Union? This doesn’t promote a conflict of interest does it? Please.   Below are the changes that Scott Walker and the Wisconsin Republicans are proposing for changes to the current “collective bargaining” “rights” the Democrats are so afraid of. When polls show that 61% of people believe that there should be “collective bargaining” it is another example of statistics being very misleading. Ask the question again comparing the current structure of Wisconsin “collective bargaining” with the Republican proposed “collective bargaining” structure and I will place a substantial wager that the overwhelming percentage of people would agree with the Republican version.  • Collective bargaining to only be allowed for base pay. • Union dues not to be collected by the state. • Annual Secret ballots to keep unions certified. • UNION DUES TO BECOME VOLUNTARY.  As to the dereliction-of-duty Wisconsin Democrats, from 2006 to 2010, when Democrats controlled the legislature and governor’s office, the same Democrats who fled their state also spearheaded controversial legislation that Republicans were not able to block, including, but not limited to:  ▪ State borrowing of nearly $1.5 billion despite an unemployment rate less than the national average ▪ Raising taxes to the tune of $900 million on cigarettes, hospitals, oil companies, and real estate in 2007 ▪ Raising taxes with a $1.1 billion tax package in 2009 which broadened the corporate tax base, increased the top personal income tax rate, reduced the capital gains tax exclusion, and increased hospital taxes ▪ Each of these tax hikes was in conjunction with increases in spending.

t5_2ss5b,happybadger,1327525546,"I know that's what they think. What I'm saying is that it's absurd to think that NAP can ever actually function on a macrosocial scale. In the past year, I have met:  - Monks  - Office workers  - Oilmen   - Sociopaths *and* a psychopath   - Christians™ who couldn't be further from their Christ  - A Muslim who couldn't be closer to that same Christ  - Radicals of many flavours  - Artists  - University professors  - Racist Cajuns   - Old Guard communists  All of these are technically in the same country. All of these come from wildly different backgrounds, generations, and regions. The only thing connecting them to each other is their biology and their passport, with everything from how they perceive the world to the people in it to themselves to their interactions with others being so impossibly different from the next person that it's actually a wonder that even a government can contain them.   The psychopath loved aggression, it was a sport. The Cajun loved directed aggression. The Christians loved aggression toward anyone who wasn't also a middle class suburbanite Christian™. The office workers looked down on the poor, the monk looked down on the office workers, and the university professor had social anxiety disorder.   In order for an anarchy to have any semblance of normality, you would have to have a population that is perfectly in-line ideologically, racially, financially, spiritually, politically, mentally, and with religious devotion to the NAP as the most important tenant of human civilisation. You would have to overcome many thousands of years of social development and many more years of behavioural development. You would have to make sure that haters can't hate and racists can't race, that everyone is free to their fullest ability but that they only do things if they don't have a negative impact on others. You would have to control business to make sure it's not exploitive, control propaganda channels to ensure they're honest, and control all social services to make sure that everyone gets equal representation so as not to cause an imbalance which leads to violence. At that point, how would you be any different from a state?   You simply cannot ever impose individual governance on that many people and expect society's worst to respect society's best and vice-versa. That kind of mindless idealism completely invalidates any sort of legitimacy that anarchy as a sociopolitical philosophy may have had. ",™

Edit: this seems to sum it up, don't know the source though:  &gt; Lift Fan Inlet:  The lift fan inlet doors were changed from a bi-fold, side-hinged configuration to a single, aft-hinged door. The change added some weight, but significantly reduced lift fan flow distortion, which increased lift fan performance and operability.  &gt;Auxiliary Inlet:  The auxiliary inlet provides an additional source for low distortion air for the engine during powered lift operation. When open at slow speeds, about sixty percent of the air at the engine face comes from the auxiliary inlet. The X-35B had a smaller opening with two doors hinged on the centerline of the aircraft. The F-35B has two doors hinged on the outboard sides of the opening. The change improves inlet flow performance. The increased size reflects the largest inlet within the structural constraints of the aircraft. ",♠

t5_2t7gg,Clbull,1327538934,"I **WAS** an EU-coordinator for /r/KarmaStarcraft along with another guy on Reddit called spitonpigeons. Karma is one of the two main Starcraft clans on Reddit and while it has a good NA presence, their EU presence was so lacking, not even I nor spitonpigeons could perform our necromancy to save it.  During my tenure I had been responsible for:  * Moderating the /r/KarmaStarcraft subreddit. * Organising events (such as KOTHs, community tournaments) and even eventually a team for the EU division.  Unfortunately for me, the EU division was so devoid of players that the only way I could have really brought players to the European Karma Open (EUKO) events was to offer a prize pool, money which at the time I was simply not willing to invest for no return whatsoever. For EUKO2, in desperation of finding players after advertising on Reddit and Teamliquid got me virtually no signups, I asked players on the /v/ channel on battle.net of all places to sign up and participate, and quickly learned my mistake when I got many games of rulebreaking, where utterances of the word ""nigger"" by the players and spectators were commonplace.  My personal thoughts are that Reddit's community needs an organisation that can produce professional events, such as what SCReddit was before the original mods left to form WellPlayed.org. I hate to be honest here but rCraft is currently a shambles compared to the original SCReddit organisation, especially when a post was made about 3 months ago to petition people to actually sign up for tournaments.   It doesn't necessarily have to be the moderation of /r/starcraft that has to embark upon this and it's probably better that it's an organisation that has its own subreddit and communicates profousely with the community there and on /r/starcraft but stays as distant from Reddit as possible in business terms  **To start this organisation, we ideally need four things:**  * **Casters** - We technically have this. We can get up-and-coming casters from the /r/starcraft community or we can work out a deal with more experienced casters like say.... Artosis, Tasteless, TotalBiscuit, Husky, iNcontroL, djWHEAT Diggity (the OP of this post) etc.  * **Stream** - Preferably a partnered one. My only issue with the SCRI was the unreliability of the stream, but then again I think that was the initial issues with say..... justin.tv (at the time.)  * **Startup capital** - This capital would be needed to hire casters, establish a prize pool, perhaps add some production values to the stream. This is sorta tricky to obtain and would require either sponsorship deals or a donation drive, but then again... we **DID** get MarineKingPrime to MLG purely from donations, didn't we?  * **Revenue** - This can come from either channel subscriptions for better video quality, advertisements or sponsorship deals.  As for my ideas. I think Reddit needs to expand the original idea of the SCReddit Invitational into something at least fifteen times bigger, such as establishing its own Starleague. Over the past year the Reddit community has been so overly bitchy about events that it's made me think **""WELL WHY NOT MAKE YOUR FUCKING OWN?""**  I think we should pursue this goal for one main reason. There are talks of the Reddit admins holding a convention soon™ and for all we know, it may be in the pipeline. I feel like if we were to host a tournament for Redditcon, we'd need the expertise of tournament organisation first, and succeeding the SCRI like it deserved to be succeeded would prove that we have the expertise to form a Redditcon tournament.",™

t5_2qh1i,SgianDubh,1327589584,"I'm sure it's been answered already, but here it is answered correctly: A police officer must have a reason to arrest a person for DUI (Driving Under the Influence).  Suspicion to stop starts the ball rolling:  he sees you weaving, driving too slow or too fast, sitting to long a stop sign or not sitting long enough, tail light busted; whatever.  Then, in order to arrest you for DUI, he needs to establish that he reasonably suspects that you are UI, hence the Department of Transportation-designed field sobriety tests: walk and turn, horizontal gaze nystagmus, and one leg stand.  He can also use a portable breath test (PBT) machine if he suspects alcohol is involved, which he invariably does because he smells the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage, and the driver's eyes are bloodshot and glassy, and the driver's speech is slurred.  The problem is, the PBT is not admissible as evidence of the actual blood alcohol level, as it is not scientiffically reliable: they need a chemical test of blood, breath or urine.  The Intoximeter® usually has been statutorily deemed reliable and admissible for the breath test portion, but it's kept back at the station. In order to get you to the station they have to arrest you, observe you for 20 minutes, and then get the test done withing 2 hours of the driving.     Without the intoximeter, the officer can still sustain a conviction for DUI just by the FST's and testifying that he's been trained to recognize drunk people, and he recognizes that the driver was drunk.  He just can't enhance the charge to one that requires a specific blood alcohol level. ",®

Yes, everything can be a ""tool"" to improve your life, quantum physics has proven the power of one's intentions and thoughts... but I know bull poopy when I smell it.  &gt;So, for your $19.99 you'll be supporting a small independent American business woman (with a warped sense of humor), her small dog with a serious Greenie® addiction, the United States Postal Service, and a humanitarian cause... you know, helping those poor saps that can't afford such an elegant, life-saving cloak. The break down is about $10.00 for me (cheaper than admission to a comedy club and a 2 drink minimum...Hey! websites don't build and host themselves), 25% to charity, and about 5 bucks for shipping, handling and materials (you think paper grows on trees? And rocks are free?).   ",®

Fuck you Europe, you send religious crazies out into a new world and then have your Big Bang Orgies and Baby Eating Festivals without us atheists in America.  Since many Americans were Catholiphobic in the beginning of America's existence, there wasn't much of an organized religion on anything more than a local level. There wasn't some standard of knowledge that all clergymen knew and agreed on, which leads to several thousand denominations of Christianity in several groups of thought such as Methodist, Lutheran, Baptist, Gideon, Mormon (though the LSD Church is an organized religion on a massive scale, but it's something of an exception). America doesn't really like large groups, it seems, in religion to government, but it stops short that large businesses.  The spark that made us as religious as we are today didn't need to spread far, since because of how scared of authority we are, any centralized authority is enough to scare us, something Communism provided and the Us or Them mentality fostered, as you can see in the Red Scare.

t5_2qh4i,JonnyQuest,1327618107,"Island in the Sea of Time-S.M. Stirling (Book 1 of trilogy)  The basic plot of S.M. Stirling's latest novel, Island In the Sea of Time, is relatively straightforward. For unknown reasons and through an unknown agency, the island of Nantucket and everything in the sea around it is transported from March 1998 to sometime around the year 1250 BC. Stirling's islanders, led by Police Chief Jared Cofflin, make do as best they can in the strange circumstances. Fortunately for the people of Nantucket, a US Coast Guard vessel, the Eagle, was also caught in the Event.  Stirling brings a large cast of characters to his tale, ranging from the visiting historian Ian Arnstein to the Coast Guard Captain Marian Alston. Each character brings their own viewpoints and abilities to the situation. While many of these characters complement each other, Stirling is aware that no community, even as small as Nantucket's, will remain a cohesive unit under any circumstances. Other characters, such as Lt. Walker and Lisketter bring their own agendas and ambitions to the situation, often with catastrophic results for the colony.  One of the strengths of the novel is the realistic portrayal of the characters. Island In the Sea of Time does not contain any Smithian or Heinleinesque superheroes who rarely make mistakes and always learn from them. All the characters tend to do things which are short-sighted and can't be corrected, and frequently make the same mistakes over when their actions remain consistent with their world view. To the same end, none of the characters has superior knowledge. By choosing Nantucket, which has a rather strange mix of population, Stirling was able to ensure a realistic convergence of skills, mechanical, artisan and even agricultural, which serve the populace well, even if it is not a self-supporting island.  Stirling has several likable characters in his cast, only occasionally resorting to caricature. Although he has ample room to give center stage to most of his characters, there are a few who could stand to take up more space. Most notable among these are Ian Arnstein and Doreen Rosenthal, both of whom will have more substantial roles in the next volume according to Stirling.  If the novel does have a weakness, it is Stirling's attention to detail. Another SF author has noted that when doing research it is important to remember what to use and what to jettison. Unfortunately, Stirling opts to use too much of his research. Scenes about the Eagle or in the machinery shop tend to bog down a little too much as Stirling tries to give the reader a flavor for the area by describing in minute detail the specific processes being followed. Stirling's editor probably could have cut between a sixth and a third of the length of the book without sacrificing substance.  Island In the Sea of Time can stand on its own. However, it is the first of a trilogy dealing with these characters and their strange situation. This gives Stirling the opportunity to explore more of his world, which may seem like a strange request given my comment about his long-windedness, but there is enough material for Stirling to write about if he can just avoid allowing too much of his research to show through.

t5_2qhhk,dodo_bird,1327631717,"Some info [here](http://www.vetinfo.com/dparvo.html). It is for parvo, but I image it works in a similar way for the other diseases.  &gt;Puppies receive protection from parvovirus in the colostrum, or first milk produced by their mothers. This protection is variable depending on whether the mother had antibodies against parvovirus and how much colostrum a puppy received in its first 24 hours of life. In some cases this protection is not conferred. This variability in maternal protection is the major reason a series of vaccinations is given to puppies. A starting date for vaccination is picked based on the puppy’s ability to respond to infection and the likely timing of exposure to the disease. **In general the first vaccination in the puppy series is given between 6 and 8 weeks of age. Only a portion of puppies are capable of responding to this initial vaccine series but since it isn’t practical to determine in advance which puppies can respond, all are vaccinated. The puppies that need the protection get it and the rest do not benefit from the first vaccine. At least 2 weeks later and preferably 3 to 4 weeks later, a second vaccination is given. A larger percentage of puppies respond to this vaccine, but not all of them. The vaccination series is continued at 3 to 4 week intervals until it is likely that all puppies who can respond to vaccination have done so.** The number of vaccinations in the series and the age at which the final puppy series vaccination is given will depend on the type of vaccine used, the breed of the puppy, the puppy’s lifestyle, the owner’s experiences and the veterinarian’s experiences with the disease. Vaccines are produced by several vaccine manufacturers for prevention of parvovirus. Most of the currently available vaccines are high antigen vaccines which break through maternal antibody protection earlier than the the original parvovirus vaccines. These vaccines also provide protection in most puppies when given between 12 and 14 weeks of age. The older parvovirus vaccines had to be given until 16 or even 20 weeks of age to ensure maximum protection. Of the currently available vaccines still in use only the Vanguard ™ series of vaccines from Pfizer Animal Health ™ are the older type of vaccine (as of 2006, per “Infectious Diseases of the Dog and Cat” by Greene). **There is a period of time, between 2 and 3 weeks, when the parvovirus strains found in most infections can cause disease before there is a chance for vaccinations to work.** At the present time there is no way to avoid this period. More frequent vaccination is not helpful and vaccinations given closer than two weeks apart may even impair immunity. **For this reason, it is best to avoid exposure to potential sites of infection, such as dog parks, dog shows and kennels until after the last vaccine in the series.** ",™

t5_2qh1i,Newdles,1327677614,"I must not be wording this correctly. Have you ever sat a Cisco exam? They aren't a walk in the park like you are making them sound. They are set up in a way that if you pass the exam, then you are essentially demonstrating your ability to perform on the job. The exams are very 'real world' as they are not purely study/memorization. They are presented as a network with a problem. They basically say figure it out, fix it (to put it short). They don't give you any information as you have to go into the question as if you are a network consultant with no knowledge of what you are dealing with. The question is a simulation where you essentially console into each of the routers and switches and type real world commands into them to figure out what you are dealing with. If you can solve these problems, you are proving that you could perform on the job and have the knowledge to do so.  To answer your questions if I have dealt with both, yes I have. I have had situations occur in real life of near identical situations that occurred on the exam. I've used simulators, emulators, a home lab of real equipment, and more importantly worked with the stuff in live environments.   This is what the certifications are there for....to prove you can do the job. Nobody walks into a CCIE lab and says ""oh psh, this isn't the real thing so it's going to be a piece of cake."" It's a **REAL LIFE SIM** presented in exam form.  Let's look at Cisco's definition of a CCNA for example: http://www.cisco.com/web/learning/le3/le2/le0/le9/learning_certification_type_home.html  The very first line says: ""Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA®) **validates the ability** to install, configure, operate, and troubleshoot medium-size route and switched networks, including implementation and verification of connections to remote sites in a WAN.""",®

t5_2qh0u,benchicaago,1327698807," I was a volunteer at Faraja House for 4 months. I wanted to share a day at Faraja house.This is a part of my blog that i wrote when I was there.  Saturday, March 5, 2011 The Rose That Grew From Concrete   Did u hear about the rose that grew from a crack   in the concrete Proving Nature’s Laws wrong it learned 2 walk   without having feet Funny it seems but by keeping its dreams  it learned to breathe fresh air Long live the rose that grew from concrete when no one else even cared! “The Rose That Grew From Concrete” -- Tupac Shakur  The Faraja Children’s home where I work was started by Martha Moraa Bosire (Mama Moraa) while she was living in Kibera slum. Kibera is the second biggest slum in Africa, housing over 1.3 million people and is one of the more dangerous places you could place yourself on the face of the earth. Moraa was born and raised in rural Kenya. She was well educated, graduating from teaching school and got a job as a teacher in the Kenyan countryside. Her husband was killed while she was living in the country and she was forced off of her land during a time of political turmoil. She lost her job and was forced to move to Nairobi to look for work. When she arrived she lived with her family in Kibera until she was able to afford a place of her own in the slum (land costs about 35,000 Ksh or $450 per room in Kibera… not that I’m testing the market…). Moraa had two (biological) sons living with her in Kibera, who unexpectedly, brought home two friends from school whose parents had passed away. After providing shelter for those two local orphans, children began arriving at the doorstep of her 10 x 10 foot aluminum sheet house… and out of the kindness of her heart, she accepted them with open arms. In 2007 political and tribal violence broke out all over Kenya, but concentrated itself in the narrow passages of Kibera. Thousands of families were forced to flee, sometimes leaving their children behind, and many more thousands of parents were killed leaving orphans alone to fend for themselves in harsh reality of the slum. Soon the number of children under mama Moraa’s supervision swelled to 34 as the number of orphans in Kibera ballooned. She was forced to move out of the slum, partially because she couldn’t fit in the crowded “house” anymore and partially because the violence that was tearing the country apart threatened her family’s safety. She was somehow able to find accommodations for her and her children, after 4 displacements, just outside Ngong where the Faraja children’s home currently exists in the broken down and tiny house that houses all 35 members of the tightest knit family I have ever seen, heard of, or read about. If you read my first round of posts, then you already know Kepha. He is the youngest person at Faraja at around one and a half (he was left at the doorstep of the children’s home in Ngong so he has no birth certificate and has an estimated birthdate). The oldest member of the family is Dama, who is 17 years old. She takes on the responsibility of second in command behind mama Moraa. Mama Moraa (referred to as mommy by all 34 children) works 24 hours a day, just to keep the orphanage afloat, and besides a handful of volunteers (I am currently the only one that she has), she has sole responsibility for all of her children. She is the mother, housekeeper, administrator, social worker, after school tutor, cook, maid and every other position imaginable at the orphanage. My responsibilities at the orphanage entail helping mama Moraa with EVERYTHING! A typical day starts by washing the dishes (by hand, using a bar of soap and an old ripped up sock or glove as a washcloth, scrubbing the cups and plates etc. and rinsing them off in a bucket. Once they have the suds off them you use a second bucket to rinse it clean and then leave it out to dry). This process takes a long time, as you can imagine, and is followed by feeding the chickens cooking whatever food they have available and sweeping the dirt and rock front yard (…you try to figure out when a dirt floor is clean). The national food of Kenya is Ugali, a cornmeal and flour dish that is cooked over an open flame until it hardens and every Kenyan you talk to tells you that it gives you power. I now know the truth. Cooking ugali is what gives you power, not eating it. You sit over an open flame in 90+ degree heat and stir this pot that gets heavier and heavier as the ugali hardens. By the time it is cooked you are lifting and stirring what feels like 150 pounds— Kepha remains with me every day because he is too young to go to school! He has a new obsession. Sunscreen. I bring it every day because the African sun is about ten feet off the ground, and he caught me spraying myself with it one day. He put his hand out (he had never seen sunscreen before… weird, he really needs it) and I sprayed some on his hand. He flinched so hard, but I showed him how to rub it in and he started giggling uncontrollably. Now whenever I put some on he comes running over and uses the spray to shower himself and rolls on the ground laughing.  My least favorite job is going through the beans and choosing the good ones vs. the bad ones. Kefa helps me and we listen to the radio, so its bearable, but you have to go through close to 15 million beans a day (divide by a little more than pi this time) and throw the ones with bugs in them out so the kids don’t eat some nasty African bug. It’s necessary because the food they get is almost exclusively donated, so they can’t be picky, but it still needs to be safe to eat.  Then the kids come home and the fun begins! I get to play with them. Playing with the kids is amazing! They are so entertained by anything and they are always having a good time playing with each other. Besides the day to day activities and fun, the orphanage is a mess. The house and children are living in dire circumstances and it is impossible to overstate their need for help. Despite the best efforts of Moraa, and the tireless work of her children in the upkeep of the house, the orphanage, meant to provide shelter for the abandoned, love for children who have lived through hate and in some circumstances, life in the face of death, is desperate. Moraa never intended to create this safe haven for some of the world’s most in-need children, and therefore never had a business plan or a means to make money. It is so in need that it has flown under the radar of all charities and has no funds. Now, seven years after she took in her first two orphans, facing eviction from the small, run down house with no shelter to turn to, with no funds for food; everyday a constant struggle to nourish her 34 children, let alone herself, I find myself in Ngong, attempting to do all I can not only to help the orphanage, but to give Moraa a much deserved break. She needs a minute to breathe, to kick her feet up and maybe, probably not, but maybe… sleep. The orphanage is in rough shape because they have no money to bring people in, and one woman who needs to take care of everything. She cannot tend to administration and upkeep when she has to cook for 35 people, take one kid to the doctor (over 30 minutes away), wash the dishes, worry about all of her kids getting to school. All of this is difficult enough and add the fact that she can’t afford the matatu ride into town (50 cents) so she has to walk back and forth which burns 45 minutes in transit alone. She doesn’t even have time to apply for help from outside sources, so the situation continues to get worse. The need is real and the stakes are incredibly high. These children have come from less than nothing, no love, no food, no refuge and have created something incredibly beautiful. The Faraja Children’s Home is a rose that grew from concrete. The orphanage is an impossible accomplishment, overcoming obstacles to become a true marvel, and a testament to what is possible from the power of kindness, determination and love. No one in the world cared about these children after they lost their parents, slipping through the cracks of humanity, but the orphanage has blossomed (not without struggle, BELIEVE ME) into something beautiful. This is only my third week at the orphanage and I have learned more from this place about dedication and hardship, how unfair this world truly is and how so much positivity can fight its way to the surface even amidst the lack of basic necessities. I have watched a grown woman cry because her 34 children have gone hungry for days with no means to get food in the near future. I have been on hand and knee scrubbing dishes in water that would make me dry-heave before this experience. But in the same day or even sometimes the same hour or minute, I have also seen a one and a half year laugh the most pure and joyful laugh you can imagine. I have watched silently as a group of children… CHILDREN, who haven’t seen food in God knows how long, serve their adopted brothers and sisters before they take their first helping. It is a powerful place, I assure you that-- and this rose growing from concrete, inhaling the polluted Nairobi air did not come about without the same struggle that keeps it alive. It is difficult to find words with enough strength to carry the weight of the burden that this place endures. I promised I wouldn’t get too depressing on you but I hope that you see the good and the bad. Because that is what Kenya is, the happiest place in the world with some of the saddest circumstances.  permalink         about blog advertise source code contact us  help help FAQ reddiquette subreddits  tools mobile firefox extension chrome extension buttons widget  &lt;3 reddit gold store redditgifts reddit.tv radio reddit  Use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy. © 2012 reddit inc.

t5_2s6rw,afreshmind,1327730531,"just gonna comment with my revisions for the mods, the file I emailed you will work better for making corrections though!  Hey, oh! Nice job!  I tried to make corrections in red and suggestions in parenthesis. But then I got lazy and stopped doing that.  So if a change is grammatically necessitated, go ahead and make that change no matter what.  But if it’s something else I put that sounds better in your head than mine, leave it be ☺ Experiences are what make us who we are. The experiences we have teach us (/shape) our values and customs. I believe that my experiences have prepared me for the affairs that will come my way. One such affair that I would (very much) like to be a part of the University of North Florida ([UNF]) Honors Program. I believe that I will benefit from the program through the exclusive classes available to Honors Students and (also from) the new duties/(opportunities) that will be available to me. I believe that I will make a quality addition to the UNF Honors Program for the following reasons. I changed some stuff in the last sentence because I’m wondering if it’s easier to say the UNF program instead of UNF’s program. But, either way, eh. They both work! One of the most fulfilling experiences I’ve had so far was when I volunteered as Technical Director for my high school’s drama program. The Technical Director’s duties include keeping schedules, managing people, and fulfilling the director and producer’s visions for the production. As Technical Director, I oversaw every behind the scenes aspect of production. I motivated and assigned people to projects.   -sidenote- if you’re gonna use a choppy sentence “I motivated and assigned, etc” it fits in better context with other choppy sentences and there’s nothing wrong with this:  I motivated people. I did this.  I did this.  Leadership blah blah.  Yknow? That can be effective.  As it is now, it just seems forced/out of place so work on making it fit better either by surrounding it immediately on one or both sides with more descriptions of your duties or weaving it in more effectively otherwise.  Being able to manage effectively to fit our tight schedule took leadership. I also gained practice in teamwork by helping crews accomplish a variety of tasks including building a platform, painting a set piece, or even ironing costumes. As Technical Director, a lot of issues fell on my shoulders. I needed to be quick on my feet and have a sharp mind to fix emerging problems. The instances I managed crises tested both my critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Once during production, we had used the last of our budget on building the set but still needed at least $150 worth of lumber. After some searching, I was able to find a local lumber dealer and make an arrangement with him where he would trade us some lumber for ad space in our play program. There was also an issue where our costume mistress was threatening to quit the production and take all of the male costumes home with her. To leverage the fallout, I presented on our need for donations at the parent booster meeting.  Even though our costume mistress ultimately chose to stay, we received enough donations to add an additional costume change between scenes. A successful person starts any job, assignment, project, or resolution with determination, devotion, and a sense of enthusiasm. These traits are clearly reflected in my academic experiences at UNF. When was touring the campus with my father in August of 2010, I heard about a deadline some 2 weeks later to have my application reviewed .  This opportunity would allow me to find out if I would be accepted for enrollment the following October. I gathered what I needed and ordered my transcripts by the application deadline. On October 2nd, I received my admission decision.  I had been invited to start classes the upcoming summer, but if I brought up my high school GPA, I could change my start date to the fall instead. I finished the first semester of my senior year with six As and one B. This improvement allowed me to change my start date to the fall, and I continued to perform extremely well in my classes during my second semester. This determination still hasn’t faltered now that I find myself taking college level courses (courses sounds better than classes sometimes) use a ; or a : here instead of a period. I completed my first semester with a 3.7 GPA. My enthusiasm hasn’t faded either. It’s the beginning of my second semester and I walk into every class (this is a case when “class” sounds nicer though, so nice job) eager to learn what each professor has to offer. I am already looking forward to the classes that I will take next fall, and the spring after that. Thanks to this zeal, I am able to complete homework easily and receive near-perfect grades. I recently declared a major in Health Administration. Before declaring, I thought I wanted a degree in business; I knew that I wanted to work in healthcare, but didn’t see how I could do this without taking up nursing. In September of 2009, my mother was diagnosed with invasive breast cancer.  Since then, I have lost count of the number of times I’ve witnessed her experiences with the health care system. I realized that there were actual people behind all of the hospital and insurance companies that helped my mom get her health back, and I decided that this was the job I wanted. My dream job is to become a Hospital Administrator. I want to be able to manage doctors and procedures as effectively as possible to provide a comfortable experience for patients on the road to recovery. To reach my goals, I look forward to completing internships that will let me/(allow me) apply skills to a job I want to make into my/a career (good sentence). I also have applied to live in the Brooks College of Health Living Learning Community for next school year. Through the Living Learning Community (if you capitalize it before, and you do, you need to keep it consistent for the rest of the piece.  Keep capitalizing the LLC or don’t capitalize it the first time., I hope to meet professionals in my field who will give me insight and advice for my advancement. I will also be pursuing a Leadership Certificate from the UNF Institute of Values. I have not taken Introduction to Leadership yet, but plan to do so this coming fall to begin my official documentation of my leadership experiences. In addition to discovering new talents, the University of North Florida’s Honors Program will help me polish and develop the skills I already have (started to develop). I am an earnest applicant who wants to grow and further mature, develop, etc. if you use develop earlier in the sentence though, switch it out for a synonym here in the name of word variance within my university. The experiences and goals I’ve written about show why I would make a good asset for the program. Try and put some transitional sentence here to connect the really straight sentence and this less explicit, more grand quote.  Maybe a sentence like “And I am determined to succeed” or something like that.  Lydia Maria Child, a woman’s rights activist from the 1800’s, once said, “Belief in oneself is one of the most important bricks in building any successful venture.” I believe in myself.  I know that I will prosper at University of North Florida, and will prosper (further, as well, even greater) in University of North Florida’s Honors Program. ",☺

t5_2qhov,thedarkerside,1327809784,"&gt; I guess you were in a decent position then. It seems that the situation has changed a lot in the last 5 years. I can certainly understand how this program is needed when there are staff shortages in areas with higher paying oil or industry jobs. People will avoid working in fast food if they have alternate options for higher pay.  Yes, but the problem is that the TFW Permits are tied to a specific job. This doesn't mean you can't switch, but it's harder and many employers don't want to do the paperwork (even though it's simple and can be done in comatose state).  I think the difference is that I read up all I could on it before I took it and understood my rights and the employers responsibility.  &gt; But Vancouver doesn't have that problem- it just makes no rational sense to me... that the number of people on this program doubles just as we go into a recession and there is a 30% student unemployment situation. These jobs would normally be grabbed up by students, and any desperate people living in poverty.  I think the problem here is simple that the Harper Government™ used the TFW program to bring in people from poorer countries to take these low-end jobs. Not because there weren't any locals that wanted / needed it, but rather that it was easier to junk people when you didn't like them anymore. That CIC is excluding these kinds of workers from the Canadian Experience Class speaks volumes to that.  &gt; I don't have a problem with immigration itself, because I understand how coming here is sometimes the only opportunity to send needed money back home to a family living in poverty. I think this program is good when it actually does fill jobs that can't be filled due to the conditions of the local economy.  The problem with the TFW program was, for the longest time, that it was essentially telling people who came here that Canada likes their work and their taxes, but would prefer if they wouldn't stay. The Liberals then introduced the Canadian Experience Class but excluded NOCs that weren't ""highly skilled"", followed by the Harper Government to suddenly issues a whole pile of them for exactly these kinds of positions.   The TFW program, plain and simple, as it stands now is exploitation of cheap labour with Government sanction.  &gt; I don't have a problem with immigration itself, because I understand how coming here is sometimes the only opportunity to send needed money back home to a family living in poverty. I think this program is good when it actually does fill jobs that can't be filled due to the conditions of the local economy.  It's not Tim Horton's, it's individual Franchisees. I guess many of those were / are immigrants themselves and maybe they see it as a way to ""pay back"" friends and family? I find it interesting that the McDonalds I have up the street that I visit from time to time seems to ""rotate"" through different ethnicities. A year ago many were East Indian, currently they're mostly Asian (I am guessing Chinese), who knows what's next.  &gt; Obviously if the entire staff is full of TFW's- they are not even trying to hire local people. I know a lot of people have applied and never heard back. So they are doing this because either they want to take advantage of people, or only want to hire people of their own race. Sure its good that more foreign people are getting this opportunity-- but now it is at the expense of Canadians just trying to survive or save for school. It helps some out of poverty, but creates more poverty here.  I am sure it depends on individuals, but it strikes me that the onus here is on the Government. For one, they could extend the Canadian Experience Class to ALL TFWs, that would allow them to apply and change the dynamic between employer and employee. It's sort of interesting to me that the lower NOC TFWs do not have the ability to renew the WP more than twice, while the higher NOCs can essentially do it indefinitely.  I think the biggest problem is simply that the current Administration wants cheap labour for corporations but not a whole lot of immigrants.",™

t5_2qh0u,YourCreepyUncle,1327885908,"For most health insurance policies, only a small handful of things are paid in full. For everything else, you either pay up to a certain dollar amount based on the procedure, or a percentage if the company doesn't have a  predetermined deductible.  For example, both a $500 X-Ray and a $10,000 MRI are usually have a $50-$200 deductible.  But for less common procedures, such as minor surgery, that deductible might be 20%. So that $10,000 minor surgery (five minute mole removal with local anesthesia), despite costing exactly the same as the MRI, has a $2000 deductible instead of the $100 deductible the MRI has.  Of course all of this is *in addition* to the $150+ per week per person that we pay for health insurance. In most cases, unless you have cancer or need major surgery, the insurance policy works out to little more than a piggy bank where you get less back than you put in.

t5_2s6rw,afreshmind,1327977193,"sent in a better format!  just posting it here for the mods!   As always, I’ll try to put my corrections in just red and my suggestions in parenthesis.  For those, if you think it sounds better your way, keep it.  It’s your work ☺  I liked the essay, best of luck!  Growing up, I remember my father telling me “be an independent, genuine lady. Work hard to achieve a good education to draw your path to success.” Growing up in China, neither of my parents had the opportunity to get an education. They immigrated to the United States with an ambition to build a family that could live a finer lifestyle. My parents continuously stressed over financial issues as their tough physical (do you mean physically-labor based?) jobs provided low income. They taught me the importance of obtaining an education and discovering a profession that I would enjoy. My interest for science began when my father was diagnosed with liver cancer due to a chronic hepatitis B infection. Before he was diagnosed, I honestly had almost no idea of what cancer was, or even what the hepatitis B virus was. I was ashamed because I was not knowledgeable about these issues and how exactly treatments, like chemotherapy and radiation, could prevent cancer cells from multiplying and disseminating. I remember trying to do some research at a young age, (you don’t even have to say “when I was in middle school” but can if you think it works) ;attempting to read articles on these topics almost seemed as if I was trying to decipher an unfamiliar language. I knew that if I wanted to become familiar with these concepts, I would need to seek this fulfillment through/by pursuing/in higher education.  	My first year of college, I did not exactly know what I desired to major in. After much deliberation, I decided to get my bachelor’s in Physiology because I (found myself/)was fascinated with learning how a variety of biological systems function in organisms. After acquiring my bachelor’s degree, I plan on applying to pharmacy school to attain a PharmD (PharmD?) degree, (in order to become a pharmacist)…you really might not even need this end to the sentence because you are going to pharmacy school to attain a PharmD to become a pharmacist.  a bit circular/repetitive, wouldn’t you say?. Because I both have strong communication skills related to working with others and find learning about the composition of drugs and how they affect individuals engaging, I believe becoming a pharmacist is a fitting prospective career (good sentence, but kind of long/hard to follow , you can chop it up if you’d like). I knew this decision would require a long path of devotion to my studies with diligence. I was/(am?) willing to make this commitment, even if it meant/(means) sacrificing a majority of my social time in order to do well. I started volunteering at University Medical Center in outpatient pharmacy IN spring of 2011 because I wanted to get an idea for the basics of working in a pharmacy. Although some people might find it a priority (a  “priority” like…work they don’t look forward to ?  if this is what you mean, I get it kind of.)to volunteer at the pharmacy, I find it more of a learning experience each time wait what?  not sure what these last 2 sentences mean/what you are moving towards. It actually amazes me how much I look forward to going into the pharmacy every week to interact with the pharmacists and technicians knowing that I’ll grasp something new. 	Earlier this year at a pre-pharmacy meeting, Doctor (it just sounds better here as doctor than dr in my opinion ☺) Boesen guest spoke regarding toxicology research and his role at the poison control center. He elucidated the development of antivenom(or antivenin if you want to sound more formal) and its experimentation on individuals to monitor the effects. I never imagined I would be captivated by his lecture regarding the field of toxicology. I began to wonder, “What if doing research is a profession I would be more fond of than becoming a pharmacist?” I immediately came to the conclusion that I needed to get involved in research to broaden my range of possible careers. good.The area of research in particular that  I find most interesting is testing drugs on biological systems and analyzing their organic interactions, both the beneficial and harmful ones. I do not want to look back ten years from now feeling remorseful and contemplating whether I would have had a more satisfying career route if I were exposed to research.  	There are many skills and opportunities I intend to gain through participation in USRB (or whatever the acronym was, sorry I can’t remember). For one, I want to meet new people who have similar passions. I hope to connect with my research group as they reveal their own personal experiences with me good sentence. I feel that hearing other peoples’ personal experiences motivates me further towards (completing) my education. I expect to successfully work together to master valuable skills that will be beneficial to me in the future and take in any criticism and advice from my new associates that will help me evolve as an individual. I cannot say that I may know a lot about/regarding the particular research area at this point, but I can guarantee I will catch on quickly and am willing to acquire the skills to eventually specialize in this area. I am a dependable and responsible person who will not let temporary failures hold me back; (in fact,) they often give me more determination to improve. I will use my problem-solving abilities and apply the knowledge I have to come up with solutions to the conflicts I encounter. If given this opportunity, I can promise I will not dissatisfy my team and will give my full dedication/pour myself fully into into accomplishing our goals and advancing our research. 	awesome work, you sound like a great candidate!

t5_2qh13,UncleVanya,1327979259,"''VANCOUVER -- In a rare move, Vancouver police are fighting back publicly against a lawsuit filed by a man who was repeatedly bitten in the leg by a police dog after he smashed the glass door of a city bus with his skateboard.  On Monday morning, Vancouver police released video footage of 33-year-old Christopher Evans, attempting to force his way onto the bus.  Police also released a 911 call made by a Coast Mountain Bus Company employee during the incident.  The video shows passengers filing onto the bus, which police said was loading near the 1400-block of East Hastings Street by Clark Drive around 12:45 a.m. on June 12, 2011.  Just before the bus pulls away, Evans appears outside in front. He swings his skateboard, hitting the closed front passenger door, cracking the glass.  ""What do you want from me?"" The female bus drivers asks, clearly alarmed.  ""Open the f---ing door,"" Evans yells back, hitting the glass several more times.  ""I'm not opening the door, you're too aggressive,"" she responds.  ""Call the police,"" an out-of-frame passenger yells, as Evans continues swinging.  The driver can be heard describing the situation over her radio to Coast Mountain dispatch, which relayed the message to 911.  Deputy chief Const. Adam Palmer told reporters the release of evidence ahead of the pending civil case is unusual, but not unprecedented.  ""There's two sides to the story,"" he said, explaining that police wanted to provide the ""full context"" of what happened that night.  Backed by Pivot Legal Society, Evans filed civil court documents on Dec. 12, 2011. He named as defendants the officer at the scene, Const. Richard Ronald Lee, and Const. Howard Rutter, the department's dog training constable, along with the City of Vancouver.  Evans required nearly 100 staples to close several wounds on his right leg after the dog attack which — according to him — came without warning.  Evans said he was wearing headphones and didn't hear the officer or the dog approaching as he skated away.  The arrest took place in a dark lane on East Hastings, Palmer said, explaining the officer pursued Evans in a cruiser with its siren and emergency lights activated before releasing the dog. ""The flashing lights would be very visible in the lane,"" he said, adding that should have alerted Evans to the police presence.  ""The officer had [Evans] into custody in less than a minute,"" Palmer said, adding the dog bit Evans four times.  Evans was arrested for mischief, handcuffed, and taken immediately to hospital.  Crown counsel dropped the charges against him after seeing photos of his leg, said his lawyer, Douglas King.  Palmer said he didn't know why the charges were dropped.  Pivot has requested a review of Vancouver police dog-handling protocol, suggesting that service dogs should only be deployed when chasing ""serious,"" armed, or potentially dangerous offenders. It also requested a review of the police department's ""bite and hold"" protocol — a method that trains dogs to immediately bite and apprehend suspects once deployed.  Vancouver police have said repeatedly over the last several days the department has no plans to change its methods.  eduggan@vancouversun.com © Copyright (c) The Vancouver Sun  Read more: http://www.vancouversun.com/sports/Vancouver+police+fight+back+over+police+bite+lawsuit+video/6073860/story.html#ixzz1l0A16dPE '' ",©

Voldemort. Sauron. Santa Claus. The Tooth Fairy. And every other fictional character that ever existed. *Your God doesn't exist.*   And he would make no sense, and wouldn't be worthy of worship, even if he *were* real. Let's look at your little creation story, shall we? According to your Bible, Yahweh put Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden with the Tree of Life and the Tree of Knowledge, and one of his first acts was to *lie to them.* ""Don't eat from them two trees, y'all, or on that day, you'll surely die!"" Mind you, he's telling this to the first two people who ever existed. People who were created to be mindless thralls, who don't have the capacity to know good and evil. People who probably aren't really clear on the implications of ""death"", being *the first two people* and all. So here are these mentally deficient children wandering around in God's Little Terrarium, and a *talking snake* tells them that God lied to them, that if they eat from the Tree of Knowledge, they would *not* die. Being mentally deficient children, Eve and Adam happily eat the fruit, and SUDDENLY their minds are transformed. They know the difference between Good and Evil, a skill which *really* would have come in handy *before* they disobeyed the guy who just wanted naked people to tell him how awesome he is all the time. And, significantly, THEY DIDN'T DIE. God told them they would surely die on the day they ate from the tree. So either God lied, God was wrong, or God changed his mind, i.e., ""was merciful"" for perhaps the first and last time. And in all three cases, that makes God an *imperfect* being. And this story throws the whole idea of God being ""omniscient"" out the window. How did Adam and Eve hide from God? How did God not know they had eaten from the tree? Or was he just being passive-aggressive with them?  You have to wonder what Old Ironfist was thinking in the first place. He created humans as curiosities, apparently, intentionally not giving them the mental faculties to evaluate their decisions properly, then stuck them in a glorified Habitrail™ with two powerful trees, one that could give them knowledge and the other that could give them *immortality.* *Wha-wha-what?* If all he wanted was naked hamsters praising him all the livelong day, why did he even put those trees in the Garden? Didn't he *know* what would happen? If you put the Hope Diamond in a hamster cage, and tell the hamster not to play with it, what do you think is going to happen? Let's even surmise that the hamster can understand what you're saying. It's a hamster. It doesn't know right from wrong, and therefore has no incentive to ""obey"" any directive but its own whims. Adam and Eve were similarly handicapped. Well, until they ate from the Tree of Knowledge, that is. And then Yahweh flips his shit and evicts their asses. Yeah, that whole thing was *their* fault, Y-Dog. Oh, and blame the talking snake while we're at it. The snake isn't the one who lied, by the way. God did.  So yeah, we have a God who created humans, but never wanted them to have free will/knowledge. Or if he did, then he tricked them and punished them for doing exactly what he knew they would do. So either God is a buffoon who stupidly led two mindless idiots into temptation and then got mad, or he's an asshole who orchestrated an elaborate trap for two mindless idiots, then bitchslapped them for falling into it.

I liked the Artisan Egg Sandwich, especially the toasted honey-wheat artisan muffin. Since it's square, the muffin would make a great Wendy's hamburger bun as well.  I also liked the w Mornin’ Melt™ Panini. It would be interesting to see Wendy's do something similar to the Jack-in-the-Box's deli grilled sandwiches using the Panini bread.  The Bacon Fire Roasted Burrito, however, was as crappy as every other fast food chain's breakfast burrito, even though it looks like the tried hard to make a good one. If you've ever had a machaca burrito at an independent Mexican restaurant or one of the few remaining free-standing Green Burritos with the old full menu, you know how good a breakfast burrito can be.

Things like throwing blackboard erasers at me very hard, calling names etc.   One day I was walking through the main hall at school and he walked really close next to me and started talking shit and being threatening. By this point I had pretty much had enough of this treatment so I waited till I was along side the lockers closest to us down the hall. When I got to the lockers I jumped up on the side of them and pushed off with my legs, elbow out and smashed him directly in the gut with my elbow.  He was pretty badly winded and through gritted teeth he said ""Fucking faggot"". I just laughed and walked off. He never bullied me again after that as he knew I would unleash the **Flying Elbow of Death™** on him again.  TL;DR Flying Elbow of Death™ will shut a bully up forever.",™
