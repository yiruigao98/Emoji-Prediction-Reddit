I’m writing this letter to explain our position and to correct any misinformation you may have heard about this issue. &gt; &gt;Susan G. Komen for the Cure exists for only one reason: to save lives and to end breast cancer forever. In the past 27 years, we’ve invested more than $1.3 billion to accomplish those goals through research and for programs that educate, screen and treat people in communities all around the world. &gt; &gt;Early screening through mammograms and education are critical to end the suffering from this disease: 98 percent of women treated for early stage breast cancer, before it spreads, are alive five years later. The widespread use of mammography and heightened public awareness of breast cancer both contribute to these favorable statistics. &gt; &gt;And while Komen Affiliates provide funds to pay for screening, education and treatment programs in dozens of communities, **in some areas, the only place that poor, uninsured or under-insured women can receive these services are through programs run by Planned Parenthood.** &gt; &gt;**These facilities serve rural women, poor women, Native American women, women of color, and the un- and under-insured.** As part of our financial arrangements, we monitor our grantees twice a year to be sure they are spending the money in line with our agreements, and we are assured that Planned Parenthood uses these funds only for breast health education, screening and treatment programs. &gt; &gt;**As long as there is a need for health care for these women, we will continue to fund the facilities that meet that need.** &gt; &gt;... &gt; &gt;**Eric Winer, M.D.** Chief Scientific Advisor Susan G.

t5_2qh2a,ajehals,1328120846,"&gt;While what you are saying is mostly true for the copyright end of things, you should note that the DMCA provisions (as Wright explains in the article) carry additional sanctions for people who intentionally remove watermarks (or even file metadata) that display copyright management information for the purpose of copyright infringement.  This rather assumes that the DMCA applies, which it may well not (depending on jurisdiction) and of course the source of the image.  You also need to keep in mind that fair use provisions don't exist every where, nor do protections against incidental infringement.  As such, the use of a copyright mark of some kind (whether embedded or visible, as per the '(c) date name' format or otherwise is essentially up to the author.  The initial assertion that ""To be valid, a copyright notice has to follow the format: © Date Name"" is simply incorrect.  In terms of actual protections, the jurisdiction of the infringer and artist come into play (as to any contracts of licenses) as well as other means of protection.  If I issue an image without a watermark and embed a copyright notice in metadata it is as protected as if I had written 'This photo is under ajehals' copyright' or '(c) 2012 ajehals' on it.",118931,110985,0,0,1,0,©

t5_2qh1i,the-slowpoke-pack,1328138772,"well, i really dont mean to argue with you. But where in copyright law is this listed?  I went to school for audio, and under sampling law, i was lead to believe it was not Legal in any way shape or form  1.	Sampling law was first established in 1991 in the Biz Markie case, when Federal District Court judge Kevin Duffy ruled that “release of a record containing a sample of another recording without permission was theft.” -- Sampling in the Record industry, Attorney Michael Ashburne, © 1994 Based on this Precedent, we used to say “The point at which an unlicensed sample is considered illegal is ‘when it is released for sale.’ As long as you don’t release it for sale, you can sample anything you wish.”  In early 2005 a Michigan judge ruled “Any uncleared sampling is illegal.” (Instructor’s recollection of a newspaper article.) This puts a whole new slant on sampling and the legal dangers we face.  2. To legally use a sample, you must get (at least) two clearances: A. From the Copyright Owner of the Recording (usually, a Record Label) B. From the Copyright Owner of the Song (usually, a Publisher)     and really, i think if they were to play even 30 seconds of a recognizable song, they would be in violation of the 6 exclusive rights of a copyright holder    THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER HAS THESE SIX EXCLUSIVE RIGHTS: ⎈1. TO REPRODUCE THE WORK (COPIES, RECORDINGS)  2. TO PREPARE DERIVATIVE WORKS EXAMPLES OF DERIVATIVE WORKS:  A. Adding original words to an old melody in Public Domain  B. Adding original music to poetry (or prose) in Public Domain  C. Adding new sections to a copyrighted song  D. MusicalArrangements  E. Changing the words of a copyrighted song (as in PARODY!)  F. Record Re-mixes  ⎈3. TO DISTRIBUTE COPIES OR PHONORECORDS   4. TO PERFORM THE WORK PUBLICLY A. RECORDINGS (Exception: Mechanical License)  B. TO PERFORM LIVE OR VIA RADIO OR TV BROADCAST  5.

If you can't watch a video for some reason, you could easily find a wealth of articles about it with a quick search.  Do you doubt everything that hasn't been spoon-fed to you?  Fine you baby, here's [an article from the Associated Press:](http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gwU-2jAsrYECdrZLEleedLjWPN7Q?docId=54cbd1c7b1044bf68360dab01207362e)  **Oakland police could face federal takeover**  By PAUL ELIAS, Associated Press – Jan 25, 2012   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Mayor Jean Quan vowed Wednesday to quickly reform the scandal-plagued Oakland Police Department after a frustrated judge threatened a federal takeover if it fails to quickly make good on changes agreed to nine years ago.  U.S. District Judge Thelton Henderson said he ""remains in disbelief"" that the department has failed to adopt the reforms.  Henderson's frustration with the pace of improvements was evident throughout a scathing five-page ruling issued Tuesday.  ""This department finds itself woefully behind its peers around the state and nation,"" he wrote.  In his ruling, Henderson increased the oversight authority of a court-appointed monitor. Oakland Police Chief Howard Jordan must now consult with the monitor before making important department decisions such as promoting and disciplining officers and changing policing policy and tactics.  Henderson ordered court hearings if city officials disagreed with the monitor's recommendations.  Quan and Jordan said a federal takeover wouldn't be necessary because Oakland's new leadership has made compliance with the settlement a priority.  ""We believe that the expertise of the monitor, coupled with the new leadership in the Police Department and the city administrator's (office) and my commitment to further incorporate the requirements of the negotiated settlement agreement into OPD's culture, will move Oakland into compliance as quickly as possible,"" Quan said in a prepared statement.  The mayor, police chief, city manager and city attorney have all been in their posts for less than two years.  ""The Oakland Police Department belongs to the community,"" Jordan said. ""The path forward will be guided by an actionable plan.""  Henderson said he will consider proceedings to appoint a federal receiver to run the department if the monitor submits a report this summer showing little improvement.  The judge appointed a monitor in 2003 to ensure the city complied with terms of a $10.5 million settlement of a lawsuit filed by victims of a notorious group of police officers known as ""The Riders.""  The group was accused of beating and framing suspects in the West Oakland area for years. One officer was acquitted at trial and criminal charges against two former officers were dismissed after two trials ended in hung juries. A fourth former officer remains a fugitive who disappeared after charged were filed in 2000.  The current monitor, Robert Warshaw, was appointed in 2010 and oversees the settlement with a staff of seven people.  The settlement included 51 specific reforms the department agreed to make within five years. Henderson noted Tuesday that he's extended the compliance deadline by years to little effect.  ""Defendants have achieved full compliance with just over half of those tasks and, worse yet, have fallen in and out of compliance on some tasks, thus indicating a lack of sustainability,"" Henderson wrote. ""The outstanding tasks are not minor formalities; instead, they are significant areas that go to the heart of any police department, including how internal affairs investigations are completed, how officers are supervised, and the use and reporting of force.""  The judge was responding to a monitor's report submitted earlier this month that included ""serious concerns"" about the department's handling of the so-called Occupy Oakland protests. The monitor told the judge that officers' actions during the Occupy protests put even the small improvements made by the department in jeopardy.  ""We were, in some instances, satisfied with the performance of the department; yet in others, we were thoroughly dismayed by what we observed,"" Warshaw wrote. ""I cannot overstate our concern that although progress on compliance has been slow, even those advancements may have been put in doubt in the face of these events.""  The monitor said the department's response to the Occupy protests will help determine whether police are making progress.  The mayor and police chief announced in December they were hiring an independent investigator to evaluate claims police used excessive force and improper tactics responding to the protests, which included several uses of tear gas, rubber bullets and ""flash-bang"" grenades on protesters.  One protester was hospitalized after being hit in the head with a flash grenade. At least one officer was demoted from lieutenant to sergeant for failing to report a subordinate blacking out his name tag.  Warshaw promised the judge a more in-depth analysis of the Occupy protests when he submits his next report sometime in July. Henderson said the results of that report may prompt him to take the extremely rare step of placing the department in a federal receivership, stripping Oakland of control of its police.  Henderson took the same extraordinary step with the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation's medical health care system. A receiver was appointed in 2006 to run the prison department's health care system after Henderson said CDCR failed to comply with a settlement agreement to provide adequate care to inmates. The court-appointed receiver, J. Clark Kelso, remains in charge of the health care system.  The mayor conceded Oakland police were moving too slowly to reform the department. But Quan said she and the new leaders will move Oakland into compliance as quickly as possible.  However, as the court has explained time and time again, words and promises are not enough, Henderson said.  ""Indeed, each time a previous new mayor or city administrator or chief of police has come on board, the court was reassured that the individual was strongly committed to reforming the Oakland Police Department, and that a change in administration and leadership was all that was necessary to push the city into full compliance,"" the judge wrote.

I think this is a good case study for us because it takes the ideas of neighborhood autonomy being practiced in south and central america and shows how they can be adapted to the special needs of the poor in the US within the legal and cultural framework of the US. also this quote pertains to us ""National surveys have established that among all the socio-economic classes the poor are least likely to participate in organized association activities.""

One person points out that a vital component to neighborhood councils functioning democratically is them not being funded by the city or any corporate sponsors.   Emeryville CA-  -- http://www.ci.emeryville.ca.us/index.aspx?NID=665 - if you google ""autonomous neighborhood councils"" this link is the first result. weird huh? maybe this woman could be an ally. I think we should at least email her. She might be able to share some info about the history of this idea in our area, what had stopped her from getting it off the ground in the past, and maybe point us to some interested parties in Oakland.  Bolivia- -- http://boliviarising.blogspot.com/2007/10/community-organizing-and-rebellion.html - this is a good one that describes the functions of the neighborhood councils in Bolivia. scroll down to ""FEJUVE: Community Organizing"" if you are short on time, that section breaks down the function of these neighborhood councils. I think it is important to note that the conditions that existed here are a lack of representation in the municipal system or an sense of alienation from those with decision making power, and a lack of basic services. These conditions I believe are present in Oakland. Where conditions differ is in racial, ethnic and cultural continuity that is present in Bolivia and is not present in west oakland.  also we were discussing at the last meeting what the basic composition of a group would look like. maybe we could take a page from their book. ""Today there are close to 600 neighborhood councils in El Alto, organized by geographic zone in each of the city’s nine districts and affiliated at the citywide level through FEJUVE. According to Uruguayan analyst Raúl Zibechi, the basic unit at the neighborhood level must have at least 200 members. The elected leadership committee meets regularly and calls a general neighborhood assembly monthly or semi-monthly. An elected leader must have at least two years of residency in the zone; may not be a merchant, transportation worker, real estate speculator or political party leader; and cannot be a traitor or have colluded with dictators. Farthing and Kohl state that women represent 20 to 30 percent of the neighborhood junta leadership, a higher percentage than is found in most popular organizations in Bolivia.""  -- http://www.towardfreedom.com/americas/603-el-alto-bolivia-a-new-world-out-of-differences - scroll down to ""Organizing for Survival and Resistance"" for the information that would be most relevant to us.   Venezuela -- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuelan_Communal_Councils -nice outline of the structure of the neighborhood councils of Venezuela. I think we could borrow some ideas from them ie (Communal councils are a group of elected persons from a self-defined residential neighbourhood of about 150 to 400 families in urban areas, and decisions are generally made by majority of raised hands. Meetings are 2-6 hour public events often held outdoors in the streets, basketball courts, empty lots or other available public spaces. Attendance varies from a typical 50 to 150 citizens. Frequency of assemblies vary from weekly to less than once a month depending on the preferences and needs of the executive body.) Other parts I would stay away from ie (elected officials, and funding from the state)  Argentina --http://www.commondreams.org/headlines02/0325-06.htm - talks about some functions of the neighborhood assemblies, their successes and reprisals they face by political forces of the state and private industry.  --http://affinityproject.org/practices/neighbourhood.html - weird web design on this one, but if you can read the text it has great content especially in regards to the history of the movement.  --http://www.projectcensored.org/top-stories/articles/23-argentina-crisis-sparks-cooperative-growth/ - great article. very inspiring and I think it is easy to see the parallels between their situation and our own.   --http://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache%3AnVatwQ3nbOQJ%3Apolisci.uoregon.edu%2Facrobat%2FHTThompson.pdf+Neighborhood+Assemblies+of+Argentina&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESiNiAeJe56Lm3odg-jRZJ6Es-MlS7bDE9e5Ix3RX16rnSFh8QqQn8he2_Al6CWemPmJO50skQdck54dEmSOcWqqpsVXE-NwK82NjMNOJjOggqjr_oQWmU027KKRKhXNdkjgf8Y0&amp;sig=AHIEtbSAk1Yko5fGPT01DwgjIzWkYI6DIQ -- kind of spooky. talks about the decline of the neighborhood assemblies by 2010, (if you notice, the other articles I sent you were from 2003ish at the height of the movement) and the reasons for it's decline. check out pages 18- 42  --http://www.publicsphereproject.org/drupal/node/560 - dont know what this ""public sphere project"" is or their agenda, I only skimmed this article so reader beware. but this article is about the brutal reprisal but political forces of the state against organizers in argentina.  -- http://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache%3AWGoie4jiJowJ%3Awww.zcommunications.org%2Fargentinas-rebellion-in-the-neighborhoods-by-marcela-valente.pdf+Neighborhood+Assemblies+of+Argentina&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESjGR20hXECeaTgr5GHs8YF8rivzIOVYHhULy1AxRHZTEhZzDZGzJoaxFu4L_sOEEfld2lQy-7Mc9aTnPpfFaL64yAi_OadafYY9lpy8YJI_DQmtniTBmj0n1l51a2Zs7QgJA1pd&amp;sig=AHIEtbT1k4v-mdGZadcJx2TFVVv57p5ydQ -- quick overview of the attitudes of Argentinians about neighborhood assemblies and participant's reasons for being involved.",432,2765,0,0,1,0,♥

t5_2t9x3,Sydius,1328212071,"**4) Item tips**  * For starting item buy either a **Doran's Ring** or a **Boots of Speed** (with 3 potions). The ring helps your early game, but the boots are part of your final items (you will eventually sell the ring) and thanks to the potions you can stay longer on your lane. * Boots upgrades: **Sorcerer's Shoes** (for magic penetration), **Ionian Boots of Lucidity** (cooldown reduction) or **Mercury's Treads** (for magic resist and tenacity). Choose the best for the situation. Don't forget, sometimes defense is more important than offense, your boots aren't exceptions.  * **Rabadon's Deathcap** is the ""core"" item for every AP champions, but it isn't cheap. Building it first sometimes isn't a good idea. Instead try 2-3 Doran's Ring, or something cheap (but useful). * **Mejai's Soulstealer** is a risky item - only buy it when you're good (and I mean really good). Running around with 0-3 charges won't win the match for you. Running around with 10+ will. * Be careful with **Archangel's Staff**: even thought it's mana and AP bonuses are charming, don't buy it for every champion. To get the 1000 mana at the end of the match you need someone who can spam his abilities (or a lot of cooldown reduction). Someone like Ryze or Annie will fill it relatively quickly. Even thought it's bonus makes it's useful for nearly everyone. * **Hextech Revolver** and **Will of the Ancients"" are good, too. Having spell vamp is a good thing, especially with some nice AoE spells. * **Lich Bane** is a two-edged blade: it can be devastating with huge AP, but never rush for it. In the beginning you won't have enough AP to spend 3470 gold on it, and maybe you can't even use it. For someone like Orianna, Ezreal (or generally everyone who use auto attack a lot) it's perfect, but for the others there are better alternatives. * For extra damage look for **Haunting Guise**, **Void Staff** or **Abyssal Scepter**. They all give you magic penetration, so you will deal more damage with less AP. Useful. * **Rod of Ages** is good, but it needs 10 minutes to be on 100%. The earlier you buy it the more useful it will be. Having a **Catalyst the Protector** in early game is a huge advantage. * Never forget about defense - it can (and will) save your life. **Banshee's Veil**, **Zhonya's Hourglass** and **Rylai's Crystal Scepter** are useful part of any mage's inventory. * If you have money but no space in inventory, buy **Elixirs**. Red makes you stronger, Blue makes you magier, green makes you... Nothing. For a normal AP carry it's useless. * **Wards**. Someone have to buy wards, but only a few people will. And, the sad truth is that (in solo queue) you can't trust anyone but yourself. Buy a few wards and use them - in the brushes, front of the dragon/Baron. Spending 150 gold for 2 wards won't make you poor, but it can save your life from the enemy jungler. And you don't want to make him happy, do you?   **5) The champions**  Here some of the easy-to-learn mages with a few words for each of them. The list isn't complete, but I try to make one where everyone can find the champion he looks for.  * **Annie**. One of the cheapest (450 IP), strongest (2 AoE spells, stun, Tibbers, shield) and cutest (she's a little girl who likes to play with fire and to beat up the wrong guys) champions out there. Very strong in 1v1, devastating in teamfights. Last hit with her Q (if it kills a target it won't cost mana), charge up her stun (1 stun for 5 casted spells) and finish your opponent with a combo. Recommended summoners are Flash and Ignite. * **Karthus** is everyone's nightmare. He has a low-cd bomb, an unfairly strong wall shredding the enemies defense, a nice AoE skill and An Ultimate What Will Kill You. Literally. Bring Ghost+Ignite or Flash+Ignite. Heal can be good, too, but the fact that you will stay on the battlefield for 8 seconds after your death makes you laugh at heal's face. You can build him a little more tanky - a Warmog's Armor is viable choice for him, but only after some AP. * **Nunu** is not a yeti but a little Yordle riding one. Brutal AP ratios, a passive lets you cast spells without mana and a very funny ultimate (try it in a brush, lure the enemy inside and laugh) makes him wonderful. Rylai's, Guinsoo's Rageblade and even a Spirit Visage can be useful on him. And he has a self heal. And he's melee. And he's only 450 IP. And he's lonely. Go and buy him. You can play him as a jungler, too. Going to mid with him isn't the best choice. * **Anivia** is a bird made from ice. She's cool (muahahah, that was a joke, you know, because she is made of... Ah, never mind...). She can stun you, she can build a wall and she can dance the chicken dance. Oh, and every 5 minutes, she's reborn, so you've got a free ""idon'twanttodie"" card. Requires more skill than the others from the list. * **Vladimir** is a Slav vampire (but he don't sparkle). He won't use mana for casting spells but his own health. Get him some Spell vamp (Will of the Ancients), a Spirit Visage with heath ans AP. Build him tanky.  * **Ryze** is a strange mage. He can cast his spell frequently to deal damage, but 2 of his spells have mana ratio. So the more mana you have, the more they will damage. Buy him everything with mana (Rod of Ages, Frozen Hearth, Archangel's Staff, etc). Stay away from clearly AP items (Rabadon's too). A 40% CD reduction won't hurt you either. In the end you've got a ""spell machine gun"" (© by Riot) who has more armor than your tank. And has 5k mana. Get him a Ghost and maybe an Ignite, too. * If you want someone who are able to support your allies, pick **Morgana**. She's a little bit difficult, but has a snare (the target can't move), a nice AoE, an anti-magic shield and an AoE ultimate with stun. And built-in spell vamp. Zhonya's Hourglass and Will of the Ancients are recommended.  There are more mages, of course, but I tried only collect the easy ones. For others, look for:  * Brand, Malzahar, Veigar, Fiddlesticks, Xerath: tons of damage, but fragile ones. * Lux, Orianna, Karma, Viktor, Zilean: strong mages who can also be supports. * Cho'Gath, Galio, Sion, Swain, Mordekaiser, Rumble, Singed: mages who can survive the apocalypse - build them tanky with AP. * Ahri, LeBlanc: very mobile, high 1v1 damage champions. * Corki, Ezreal, Gragas, Kog'maw, Nidalee, Twisted Fate: champions who benefit greatly from AP (but for most of them it isn't the most viable option).  **5+1) The different types of mages**  * **The high burst AP Carry**: This mages deals massive amount of damage in a few second, and this is their biggest advantage - but cooldowns are killing them, literally. They are excellent in 1v1, some of them (Annie, Ahri) in teamfights, too. Your main duty is to kill (or at least deal tons of damage) the enemy carry before he will rape your team. Examples: LeBlanc, Annie, Ahri, Brand. With enough AP, nearly every mage can be one of them. * **The CCasters**: They are contribute the team with not only damage but with crowd control too. Nearly every mage has some sort of CC (Annie's stun, Swain's Nevermove, Nunu's snowball), but a CCaster has at least two. Examples are Lux, Morgana, Viktor, Swain. Alistar can be built into a sucsessful CCaster. They are can also be built into support heroes. * **Melee mages**: As the name suggest, they are not ranged champions but melee ones. Thanks for this they are able to survive most things ranged ones can't. If your team don't have any tanks, you *can* build them tanky (but not in every case you *should*). Nunu, Cho'gath, Kassadin and Mordekaiser are examples for them. * **Tanky mages**: These are champions who have skills/mechanism/useful builds making them into a tanky character (but in most cases they **won't be effective as a pure tank**). For this, they can be effective off-tanks (someone, who built moderate defense but also able to deal serious damage), or (some of them) pure tanks. Cho'gath, Galio are viable as pure tanks; Ryze, Vladimir and Swain are simply tanky thanks to their builds. Vlad's passive makes him even more stronger (ap to health, health to ap). Nunu and Mordekaiser can be built into tanky (Morde's second viable build is the tanky one). Alistar, thanks to his ultimate (damage reduction) is a natural tank and have some nice AP ratios. * **The dualclass mages**: They are all have a primary build (AD carry, tank), but they can be also sucsessful as mages. It's important to know that **they are more useful with the primary build.** For this, building them into pure mages is wrong in most of the cases; a hibryd build is strongly recommended. Ezreal and Corky can be mages instead of AD carries; Amumu and Alistar are can be limited mages (they are most useful in their original builds, tank and support respectively). The original supports are useful as mages, too (Janna, Soraka, Taric, Sona). In their case, it's important to decide the right thing: do the classic build or try the AP way? In rare cases (for example your team already has a tank but you want to play Amumu) you can try it, but don't mess up a nearly perfect team comp with playing an APmumu instead a tank one. * **The omega mages**: Their name is tricky. They aren't the best mages; they are the worst (hence omega). Basically every champion who has at least one skill with AP ratios can be an omega mage, but you shouldn't play them this way (only if you want to troll games, but don't do that). But of course you can always try them in custom/coop games :) The important thing is that have fun with them **and** don't mess up the other 4 people's game. Playing an omega mage in normals/ranked mostly get you a few reports (*if you're good with them - and I mean really, really, gamebreaking, ultrafed good - they won't report you. Maybe*).  **Disclaimer**: The two lists above are basically the same - the second is more detailed. None of the list is full neither complete - putting all the mages into categories based on their abilities/possibilities would be take forever. Generally, you *can* play 85% of the champions as mages, but you *shouldn't* do that unless you know what are you doing. Really. There are dedicated mages, play them, at least until you become better. Playing Amumu as a mage is significally harder that playing him as a tank.    Now, go and play some mage, mate! And good luck with them :)  Sydius  **Changelog**  * Added new rune suggestions (thanks for PsykoDemun and treqbal) * Added a new mastery build (thanks for PsykoDemun) * Added a tip to Clarity use (thanks for everyone who support/against using it) * Added new champions into the list. * Edited Nunu with a note about going mid (thanks for U_DONT_KNOW_TEAM and BloodFlood - I never said Nunu should go mid, but I know if you read the ""most mages goes to mid"" part it suggest it) * Added a detailed list of the types of mages.",19863,6241,0,0,1,1,©

t5_2r9po,OldManPsylus,1328246671,"I'd like to add in from what other folks have said that gear of good quality for your level is designed to be easy to get. If you are someone who doesn't care one bit about the aesthetics of your character, then you will find the gear system in GW2 to be rather bland.  A good example to use is that in GW1, when you reach level 20, it is fairly easy to get gear with the maximum armor value for your class and with nearly-max power enchantments (I say near-max because some specific runes would cost more than they were worth to a fresh level 20, like the max +hps rune). ArenaNet likes this philosophy when it comes to gear, so they are applying it to GW2. The gear grind isn't for stats, it is for appearance.  Now with that big'ol speech out of the way, yes pvp and bosses/DE-bosses yield loot. The loot, however, will not be like in WoW where it will have a major stat advantage over something you'd get for a smaller event of the same level. Instead, it might have a more impressive graphical design; like an every day broadsword graphic vs. a Crazy Flaming Dragon Sword of Lightning Chickens^© . Just like in WoW, this is a status symbol that would tell anyone looking at you that you've achieved something more difficult. The difference is, unlike WoW, the gear is not necessarily more powerful, and thus the game doesn't slowly become freakishly imbalanced as more difficult dungeons are added.  Edit: Gear does get better as you level, but it is always easy to get good gear for your current level. Special gear tends to have a cooler cosmetic appearance without having a drastically higher stat allocation.",2393,348,0,0,1,1,©

The media, celebrities, politicians all seem to be more about proper clothing and sweet sweet sounding voices.  It's like a form of skin color prejudiced to me, it's a prejudice against certain manners and styles, subcultures, etc.  Things are often normalized in the name of commerce... proper queues, standardized currency, organized transportation.  We are dealing with the parts of life that a machine-system does not serve... and has become too mechanical to listen to the human side of the equation.  Maybe we need people speaking in their own imperfect non-Public Relations bullshit voices!  New York City Professor Joseph Campbell at age 83, before he died, in 1987: ""This is the threat to our lives that we all face today. Is the system going to flatten you out and deny you your humanity, or are you going to be able to make use of the system to the attainment of human purposes? How do you relate to the system so that you are not compulsively serving it? It doesn't help to try to change it to accord with your system of thought. The momentum of history behind it is too great for anything really significant to evolve from that kind of action. The thing to do is learn to live in your period of history as a human being. That's something else, and it can be done.""",14748,1013,0,0,0,0,☯

t5_2qh1i,jschall2,1328410865,"**On hex**: First you have to understand bases:  Decimal is base ten, so there are 10 distinct digits and the places are powers of 10. So, in the number 123, the 3 is in the 10^0 place, the 2 is in the 10^1, and the 1 is in the 10^2 place. You can find the number by adding:      3×10^0 + 2×10^1 + 1×10^2 = 123   Hex is base 16. So there are 16 distinct digits (0-9 and then A-F) and the places are powers of 16. In computers, hex numbers are often identified with the prefix 0x. So, in the hex number 57 (0x57), the 7 is in the 16^0 place and the 5 is in the 16^1 place, and the number (in decimal) can be found by adding:      7×16^0 + 5×16^1=87  A-F just represent 10-15, so the number 0xE57 would be:      7×16^0 + 5×16^1 + 14×16^2 = 3671   Additionally, since 16 is 2^4, every hex digit represents exactly 4 base 2 (binary) digits. So to convert 0xE57 to binary, you can just take the 4-digit binary representations of the digits and concatenate them like so:      E=1110     5=0101     7=0111     E57=1110 0101 0111  **On the length of a text file:**  Yes and no. ASCII is only one way to encode characters. Unicode takes 2 bytes per character. But for notepad, the answer is: probably. Some caveats: it is likely that a line break is being written at the end of the file, which on Winderz is TWO characters for some ungodly reason. Every linebreak is going to take up two characters.  If you have access to a linux or unix-y machine, you can see character encoding and hexadecimal in action by piping echo to hexdump. For example:      jschall@jon-laptop:~$ echo ""I had fun once. It was awful.""|hexdump -C     00000000  49 20 68 61 64 20 66 75  6e 20 6f 6e 63 65 2e 20  |I had fun once. |     00000010  49 74 20 77 61 73 20 61  77 66 75 6c 2e 0a        |It was awful..|     0000001e  (How to read: all numbers are in hex. The first 8-character number on each line is an offset, so it's the position of the first byte/character in the line. For example, the ""I"" in ""I had..."" is at the 0th position, and the ""I"" in ""It was..."" is at the 0x01=16th position (but will actually be the 17th character, since it starts counting at 0). Then the hex digits are listed, 16 bytes per line. Then the ascii is listed. Periods are used where the byte is not in the ascii table or is an ascii control code. Note that echo outputs 0x0A at the end, which is a newline.  And here's a unicode character:      jschall@jon-laptop:~$ echo -n ☠ | hexdump -C     00000000  e2 98 a0                                          |...|     00000003  So the ☠ character is 0xE298, and ASCII 0xE2 is not representable on the screen, and neither is ASCII 0x98. The 0xA0 is again a newline.  CONSIDER YOURSELF EDUMACATED. Wait, don't. Don't trust me, experiment for yourself. Try to prove that I slipped up somewhere.",5829,1327,0,0,1,1,☠

t5_2qhk3,C0CKPUNCHER,1328595038," Feminists often point to capital P Patriarchy as the culprit behind all sexism, all oppression of women (though they’re finally admitting that “patriarchy harms men too”, which is something of a victory for common sense, however small), and the “Othering” of women by men. The way they approach the stark reality of most of human history is from the standpoint that men somehow consciously or willfully constructed and directed femininity for their own benefit, and that women just kind of had to go along with it because they were physically weaker. They presume that masculinity developed under the influence of men alone in such a way that it became attached to characteristics of agency, like strength, action, and virility. They believe men imposed this system on women, essentially Othering women as a class, and turning even the simple partnership of marriage into a contract of servitude and oppression of women for the benefit of men. What they fail to realize is that patriarchy imposed other characteristics on men than those of agency–disposability, utility, self-sacrifice and resource acquisition–and for the vast majority of our evolutionary past, women were the main beneficiaries and enforcers of these patriarchal gender norms.  Look at it this way. You have a rich man. This is his primary characteristic open for discussion, and he has all kinds of agency–he has flipping great wodges of money to purchase whatever he requires, servants to do his purchasing for him, to cook his meals, clean his house, maintain his vehicles, drive him around, and because he’s wealthy he has friends and hangers on who “bask in his glow”. Until his money is gone. And then he becomes C. Montgomery Burns on an episode of the Simpsons, unable to even dial a phone, standing in the supermarket for 15 minutes wondering if there’s a difference between ketchup and catsup. He can’t fix a doorknob. He can’t microwave a Mr. Noodles. He can’t even find his own clothes. He had agency, but it was dependent on his wealth.This is a very tempting way to live a life. It really is. If you didn’t HAVE to ever clean your own gutters or change the oil in the car or go out and risk your life killing and gutting an animal or defending your village from the assholes down the valley, why would you?Men were, in many ways, all through human history, a servant class, not a class of oppressors. This is because even in the earliest stages of human evolution, we had an instinctive understanding of the ultimate equation. 10 women + 1 man = 10 babies, and that switching the numbers around pretty much meant the end of the whole shebang for us.Dangerous work was the work of men, and it still is. Physically taxing work was the work of men, and it still is. Going out into the big bad dangerous world to get resources while women stayed safe was the work of men, and it still is. Those among our ancestors who were born without some pattern of these gender roles in their brains would have ultimately been unsuccessful wrt passing on their genes. The woman who decided to go hunt mastodon rather than staying home in the cave was much more likely to end up dying young.And as has been demonstrated through genetic research, individual women were much more successful throughout the whole of human history at passing on their genes. 80% of the females who have ever lived had children. Only 40% of the males who have ever lived have done the same.Because all those small innate gender differences feminists view as insignificant now, were generated and reinforced by one HUGE difference, and that is that females, not males, are the limiting factor in the perpetuation of any species. A human settlement survived through the toil and sacrifice (often of the lives) of its men, and through the safety of its women and children. This is simply the way things had to be throughout the majority of human evolution, and when they weren’t, natural selection selected those individuals out of the species.  ♦◊♦  ",16727,2708,0,0,1,1,♦

Red meat and colon cancer: should we become vegetarians, or can we make meat safer? Corpet DE. Source Université de Toulouse, ENVT, INRA, UMR Toxalim, Capelles, France. d.corpet@envt.fr Abstract The effect of meat consumption on cancer risk is a controversial issue. However, recent meta-analyses show that high consumers of cured meats and red meat are at increased risk of colorectal cancer. This increase is significant but modest (20-30%). Current WCRF-AICR recommendations are to eat no more than 500 g per week of red meat, and to avoid processed meat. Moreover, our studies show that beef meat and cured pork meat promote colon carcinogenesis in rats. The major promoter in meat is heme iron, via N-nitrosation or fat peroxidation. Dietary additives can suppress the toxic effects of heme iron. For instance, promotion of colon carcinogenesis in rats by cooked, nitrite-treated and oxidized high-heme cured meat was suppressed by dietary calcium and by α-tocopherol, and a study in volunteers supported these protective effects in humans. These additives, and others still under study, could provide an acceptable way to prevent colorectal cancer. Copyright © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",3594,112,0,0,1,1,©

If that happened, based on experience, I predict something like this in a US court: The images are all over the internet, so proof of access is given. The court would have to be persuaded that there was enough substance there to be copyrightable ( you can't © a circle, or an x for example ) and the sales of these Hot Topic shirts somehow resulted in damage to the holder of the ©. ( the easiest part of his case, if he was selling the images on just about anything anywhere himself ). He would have to explain why he had injected the images into the public in the first place, without any sort of © notice, and why he had never notified anybody prior to this point that they were misusing his images. The defendant would argue that it was because of this negligence that they thought these images were public domain, but the defendant is going to have to admit that he knew, without a doubt, that **HE did not generate them himself**, and yet decided to use them anyway. A magistrate would encourage a settlement in which the defendant would stop selling the shirts, maybe fork over or destroy existing inventory, and destroy the screens used to manufacture. Neither party would collect legal fees from the other, and the plaintiff would make it a point to mark his work clearly from that point on. This exchange took years to happen, and both parties are out between $20,000 and $100,000. ",316179,3159865,0,0,1,1,©

t5_2qh0u,H3g3m0n,1328827400,"This might be better thank printing out pages of passwords: http://www.passwordcard.org/en  Personally I find the best way is to come up with a 'system' to generate passwords.  Most passwords now days are for websites. Count the number of vowels in a url, spell out the numbers as words seperated by underscore. Swap E with 3, o with 0, s with $ (and what ever other 133tsp34k takes your fancy. Swap the first 2 letters. Make the last 2 letters uppercase. Add predefined symbols after the first and third letters. Add some predefined padding thats common for all your passwords (doesn't have to be much just a few letters).  Work out what parts of the domain name are important (ie include www/com or just the middle word, some sites use things like forums.something.com, wiki.something.com, blog.something.com and othersites drop www which might make including those things a pain).  Make sure that your password is at least 8 characters for any possible input. In this case the smallest possible would be ""Two_Two"" but that's what the padding is for.  Don't use this specific system make your own ☺. Ensure your system makes use of mIxEd caps and $ymbols. Ensure your system has enough steps that reverse engineering it isn't likely. Make sure you know the order. Make sure the system is intuitive to you.  Use KeePass (or KeePassX) to store your passwords in. Sync it with dropbox there are android apps for both. Otherwise their might be a webbased password storage system but you will want to make sure its encrypted at the client end for obvious reasons. This is useful for non domain based passwords or on the off chance the site changes its domain name (del.icio.us -&gt; delicious.com).  For example:   * ""www.reddit.com""  * ""reddit"" (strip domain stuff)  * 2 vowels, 4 constants  * ""two_four"" (as words)   * ""wto_foru"" (swaped first 2 and last 2 leters)  * ""wto_foRU  * ""w!to@_foRU"" (added symbols after first and 3rd character)  * ""Padw!to@_foRU"" (final, added ""Pad"" padding to start).  The main problem with that system is the password will be the same if the numbers are the same and many sites will have similar ranges. A better solution would be to include at least part of the sites url in the password itself but only a little bit (if you just appended 'reddit' to the end it would be obvious, if you just took the 3rd and last characters then it wold be harder.). Padding might not even be necessary.  * ""dtw!to@_foRU""  Another thing is it can be a pain to type things like that, but if you use them enough you build up muscle memory and don't need the 'system'. Sites less visited you will need to reverse the system and type slowly but you don't visit those sites much so it's less of an issue.  Keep 1 or 2 low security passwords for things you just don't really care about. When you need to put them in plain text config files or have to tell people.  The only thing I haven't really worked out to well is passwords for nondomain based things. SSH boxes and so forth. You for your email do you use gmail.com (your actual address) or mail.google.com (the site you go to read the email). What about the password for my smart tv? But thats what the keepass db is for, just pick a word instead of the url generation seed and use that then look it up if your forget the word.",19509,120,0,0,1,1,☺

Unfortunately, medical marijuana does not qualify as such.  From the [Medical Review Officer Manual for Federal Agency Workplace Drug Testing Programs](http://workplace.samhsa.gov/DrugTesting/doc/MRO_Manual_2010_100908.doc):  &gt; Marijuana is a Schedule I drug.  Medical marijuana is a controversial issue, and there has been some scientific evidence that smoked marijuana is beneficial for patients with debilitating symptoms such as unmanageable pain and vomiting.

It is the sole pharmaceutical source of THC and is available as Marinol® (Roxane Laboratories).  The drug has psychoactive effects that may present safety issues.

t5_2r7mh,Seele,1328988127,"I'll start with what we can agree on:  &gt;Reliability, repeatability and usefulness in predicting future events.   Yes - absolutely, well said. If it doesn't satisfy at least the first two criteria, it is not science. The third criterion I find more problematic. Scientific predictions concern the drawing out of consequences that are implicit in a theory. They may equally well account for past observations, and suggest new ones not anticipated beforehand. You cannot necessarily predict what a scientific theory will predict.    &gt;my issue with your logic is that, if the astronomical systems of Ptolemy, Newton and Einstein were sufficiently reliable, repeatable and useful, each would never have had to been adjusted, tweaked, thrown out.  Actually, that is precisely my issue with your logic. It is a formula for stasis. It provides no grounds for replacing one theory with another which explains more.  By your criteria, it would have been enough simply to continue to add ad-hoc adjustments to Ptolmey's system ad-nauseam. It need never have been replaced by a better account of reality on the grounds that it just worked. It might have become more cumbersome with each tweak to absorb any discrepancy with observation, but it would have remained compatible with your criteria of reliability, repeatability and usefulness in predicting future events. So-what if Mars ends up with a square orbit, or Venus accelerates and stalls like a learner driver, and Neptune remains undiscovered, never to be found, because every discrepancy between observation and theory can just be swept under the rug with a patch. The Microsoft Windows® theory of knowledge.  In fact, it is worse than that. Ptolmey's system was an attempt to find an explanation of reality to begin with, but your criteria are equally compatible with an astronomical system that has no concern at all for truth - you could just as easily base it on some scheme involving deities of various stature driving chariots and battling it out with other supernatural entities, all under a some kind of dome with holes cut out for the stars. A wobble in the orbit of Jupiter? Easy-peasy - Zeus had to swerve his chariot to avoid the tooth-fairy, and so on, etc, etc. Slap it on. If it works, it works.     &gt;The essence of science is also absolutely not to unify 'older ones (deep theories)'.  It absolutely is. Otherwise it is simply not worth doing. The essence of science is the desire discover, to find out - to know. All of the great advances of knowledge have the structure that older, seemingly disparate, branches of knowledge become special cases of the new, and vast new areas of discovery are opened up. There is no impetus to make such advances if your only concern is 'Reliability, repeatability and usefulness in predicting future events'. It is not enough. Again, your criteria alone, without the drive to know, are a formula for stasis.      &gt;It is to test ideas, concepts, models and theories to either continue to validate them, or to break/teak them to make them more useful and accurate at describing the universe.   Yes, that is what scientists do - with the emphasis on breaking their theories rather than validating them. If the theory breaks, it is falsified (no matter how useful it is). If the Eddington experiment had failed, Einstein was fully prepared to go back to the drawing board.     Are you prepared to give up the quest for knowledge and replace it with a kind of incurious pragmatism?   ",13411,9453,0,0,1,1,®

t5_2qpp6,RainbroDash,1329005445,"Dunno if this has already been asked, hopefully not!  You previously mentioned in one of your earlier vLogs micro techniques that protoss's (protossi?) can and should be doing mainly involving sentrys and templar in speed prisms in the main engagement, when tosses are all getting good enough to use all these techniques does the terran have to approach the late game differently and if the engagements now favour protoss? Also what can they really do against this or is it just down to having to control vikings/marines better?   Bonus question if i'm allowed, are there any similiar terran techniques that are unused and should be? If you wanna hide them all for yourself your super mean, p.s love vlogs ♥",2788,544,0,0,1,1,♥

So I can only imagine how maddening this situation was for people who are seriously emotionally invested in this team.  With that preface, emotion does not cloud my judgement here:   The Eagles need the Ronco® defense. They need to ""SET IT AND FORGET IT!""  SheSaidSheWas12 brings up a good point, which is that the safeties didn't play well - really, the entire middle of the defense was soft/lacking. So sometimes the corners were called into support duty.  I don't know if the Eagles really had the luxury of just having the corners play shutdown the entire game, but I'd like to think it would have worked if they had tried and stuck with it. I'd rather give up 5 yards over the middle than 30 on the edges.   And really, if you've got the 2 corners 1-on-1 shutting guys down, that leaves 9 to cover 4. ",580937,81783,0,0,1,1,®

t5_2qh3s,notacrackheadofficer,1329076873,"Hubert Selby's The Room is very obscene, in inventive as well as boring ways, and it too will attract readers who really shouldn't be there. Here point of view is all, as Selby ransacks the paranoid mind of a prisoner waiting to be tried, apparently on a minor charge. I say ""apparently"" because this is one of those novels that accord merely ""objective"" details very little status. The prisoner fantasizes endlessly….  And Selby, who in Last Exit to Brooklyn so impressively showed his power to imagine psychosexual extremity and the lurid despairs inside seemingly commonplace souls, gives this prisoner plenty to think about, as he dreams up hideous vengeances on cops, women, and the other authority figures of his humiliating history.  But it's terribly difficult to render, from inside, dull and resourceless minds like this one. The trick is not to suggest that such people really are richly aware and sensitive when you get to know them, down there beneath the impassive, inarticulate surface. Few writers even come close—offhand I think only of Defoe, Flaubert, and Joyce, which is select company. Selby is a conscientious craftsman—the raw immediacy of Last Exit was sustained by a remarkable sense of structure and timing. But, like everyone else, he's no Joyce, and The Room falls short of its ambitions….  The Room is powerful and disturbing even so, but the boundaries of Selby's art and moral vision are too large to be filled up by a single commonplace mind, psychopathic or not.      Thomas R. Edwards, ""The Real Thing,"" in The New York Review of Books (reprinted with permission from The New York Review of Books; © 1972 by NYREV, Inc.), March 9, 1972, pp. 19-20.  Hubert Selby, you cannot fail to recall, wrote a tremendous, multi-facet book named Last Exit to Brooklyn. As you will recall with greater clarity still, that book was unsuccessfully prosecuted by some gaga weirdos whose idea of the contemporary novel begins with Jean Plaidy and ends with Penelope Mortimer (bless their nylons)….  However, despite all the rape, bestiality, brutal sadism, mutilations and manglings, no one could read this novel [The Room, Selby's second book] without knowing that they have been through a strange and harrowing trip of unimaginable pathos. Not despite the untempered psychotic violence of the work but because of it….  Although Selby's writing assumes many textures, from sequential exposition to raging curses relentlessly smeared on with a palette knife, the book itself is both organic and indivisible. It is considerably more than its parts. It is a soul stripped bare, flinching and wincing and screaming and bleeding and struggling for breath. Scarcely a let-up, with very few moments of even recollected delight. Not a happy book but an unavoidable one. Maybe even a great one.

t5_2qpp6,Daunteh,1329091284,"As a mid masters Protoss player who likes to play new maps, I've played around 50 games on this map now. These are my thoughts on the different matchups:  PvZ: Obvious FFE map, plenty of places to sneak out probes and hide pylons if you want to go for a +1 zealot timing. Zerg have to be extremely active with his lings if he wants to be 100% safe. Even so, you can push out with a one or two zealots to make way for your probe(s). Clearing Xel'Naga towers is very important, as it will keep Zerg on his toes as he'll have a harder time spotting any pushes coming, and especially, it can hide your Void Rays and Phoenixes until they arrive at his potential 3rd.  If the Zerg decides to go for an early 3rd, a +1 Zealot/SG timing can be very effective as the distance between natural and 3rd for zerg is quite long, so by the time your timing attack hits, he shouldn't be able to have gotten creep connected between the hatches. This means that it takes ages for his Queens to move between bases, and the funny thing here, is that the air distance between his 3rd and his main is extremely short, so if he brings over a lot of Queens to his third, you might be able to do a lot of damage by quickly swooping into his main.  When you decide to take your 3rd base, I'd really advice leaving a Sentry or two at the ramp by your natural, as it's only 1 FF wide before rocks are destroyed. Meanwhile you should be walling the ramp at your 3rd. I wouldn't invest too much into the wall to the side of your 3rd, unless you are powering up with Gateways anyway. I generally like to just wall off with mostly pylons, as proper scouting should be enough to spot a runby (obs, spotter pylons/probes, hallu).  When it comes to walling at your 4th/5th bases, I actually disagree with dApollo (still ♥ you). At that time, you should have sufficient means to have almost complete map awareness, so spotting his main army shouldn't be too hard.  if you see his army moving, your army will move accordingly. While ling runbys seem like a nice way of harassing, this isn't the only (or even the most effective) way of harassment at this stage of the game. Far more devastating tactics include Muta harass, Roach drops, Baneling drops and burrowed infestors. So I'd rather just plant down pylons and lots of cannons hugging your Nexus, as they deal with all those kinds of harrassment, instead of just ling runbys. If you see his army moving, your army will move accordingly. While ling runbys seem like a nice way of harassing, this isn't the only (or even the most effective) way of harassment at this stage of the game. Far more devastating tactics include Muta harass, Roach drops, Baneling drops and burrowed Infestors. So I'd rather just plant down pylons and lots of cannons hugging your Nexus, as they deal with all those kinds of harrassment (or at the very least buys you time to get some units over there), instead of just ling runbys. Also one HT with high energy at each vulnerable base can be very useful, if you're playing versus a very harass oriented Zerg.  I'd also advice getting the bases that leads to you having to move your army as short distances as possible, and with as few attack routes as possible.  For your own late-game harass, I would definitely recommend DT, as there are so many paths for them to take while going unnoticed (It's not like Shakuras, where a spore in the middle denies any DT tactics unless you use Warp Prism or some hidden pylon shenanigans), and with the distances between bases + multipe options for 4th/5th/6th bases, you can often deny building Hatches and even get away with the DT(s) before Overseers arrives.  General army composition favours Colossus rather than HT, as there are just so many chokes to FF which makes it easy to get into a nice position with your army. The map also discourages Muta play, because of how the first 3 bases are laid out, so Robo should be way safer than templar tech. All the various cliffs also favours Colossus because of their mobility with cliff walking and their huge range. Combined with Blink and Sentries for FF, I think this will be the obvious choice for most Protosses on this map.  Feel free to agree/disagree with me, and add your thoughts to the thread.

Valve, the Valve logo, Steam, the Steam logo, Source, the Source logo, Valve Source and Dota are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of Valve Corporation.""  No, DOTA is NOT a registered trademark of Valve corporation. Also note it is DOTA, not Defense of the ancients 2, that is from Valve themselves and their official DOTA 2 website.   ""PC Gamer: Do you think of Defense of the Ancients is a genre, considering how many games use it as a template? That includes League of Legends, Blizzard’s upcoming DotA. What’s your opinion on that?  Gabe Newell: I think that the action RTS genre is a great genre, so we’re excited – we’re fans of it. We got into this because a bunch of people at Valve were huge fans of what IceFrog had done, and it was great to find out that he was interested in doing the sequel that removed some of the constraints he’d been living with.  But you know, we’re fans of the genre – we love to play these games ourselves, so we think it’s great that there’s more attention being paid and a lot of games are going to get developed.    PC Gamer: So you don’t mind that you’ll be competing alongside the already established League of Legends?  Gabe Newell: We’ve been around for a long time and there’s always this assumption that videogames are a zero sum game; that if Quake does really well, Duke Nukem will suffer, and that’s never the case. Gamers who play a good game want to play more games, not fewer games. So you’re never hurt by the success of another games developer – you almost always benefit.  You know, when Zynga go out and gets 100 million people playing one of their games in two months, I think every game developer is benefiting. Not everyone should throw in the towel and say: “We’ve been defeated.”  Now DOTA is not a genre anymore, it is a name part of the ""action RTS"" genre. Also he basically calls Riot games and Blizzard for being the same as Zynga lol  Anyway, you can always use Neogaf that is not just another shitty forums, they post sources on there.

Originally invented by King Camp Gillette in 1904 the open comb was the original design for the safety razor head. Now recommended for shavers with a particularity heavy or coarse beard, as the comb can catch awkward hairs easier or with less passes than the straight bar razors. Thought to be more aggressive the blade is just exposed between the combs so easier to nick yourself if you apply any pressure. This being said it's possible to achieve a great shave no matter your beard / skin type with any head design it's just an open comb does work very well on thick or coarse beards.  **3-Piece** - The handle, comb &amp; top come as separate pieces &amp; screw together.   * These models are light weight so have a more even balance, where as the 2-piece are weighted at the handle end.    * More manoeuvrable &amp; less aggressive than the 2-piece.   * Available in 3"" or 4 "" long handled models.  3""    [15C](http://www.fendrihan.com/images/MRK15C-2.jpg)   [41 (aka 1904/1906)](http://www.italianbarber.com/images/merkur-41c.jpg)  [985CL (travel, 2 piece handle)](http://connaughtshaving.com/_wp_generated/wpf97d27f4_05.jpg)  4""   [25C](http://www.pampered.com/assets/images/pics/HR_401-019-00_Merkur_25C.jpg)    **2-Piece** - The comb bar is fixed to the handle    * These models are heavier so can provide a more aggressive shave than the 3-piece.   * Thicker handle than the three piece which some find more comfortable to hold.   * Available in 3"" or 4 "" long handled models.  3""     [11C](http://straightrazorplace.com/attachments/razors/84817d1323602510-de-selection-help-merkur-11c-open-comb-de-razor.jpg)  4""   [12C](http://www.fendrihan.com/images/MRK12C-4.jpg)  **Slant Head (closed comb)**  The most aggressive of the fixed head razors but with a reputation of being fierce which is not really deserved.

t5_2r0gj,jpndoc,1329202898,"I saw this right before I stopped believing in the church and it kind of started me on my quest for the truth. I saw it in Nauvoo with the rest of my singles ward and everyone was weeping and exclaiming how they felt the spirit so strong and yet I felt nothing. All I saw was a whitewashed history with a lot of manipulation created by swelling music and fancy cinematography. I like how they portray how inclusive Joseph Smith was to black people. As if that is supposed to erase the fact that later Brigham Young began the racist policy of denying priesthood and temple ordinances to Black church members. Church films like this one are created to manipulate the emotions of members or church investigators so that they feel something which they would identify as ""feeling the spirit."" It's all part of what Bonneville Communications, the church's production company, calls “HeartSell”®. According the their website http://www.bonneville.com/?nid=32 , ""Our unique strength is the ability to touch the hearts and minds of our audiences, evoking first feeling, then thought and, finally, action. We call this uniquely powerful brand of creative ""HeartSell""® - strategic emotional advertising that stimulates response."" They tell members and investigators that this emotion is confirmation that what they are seeing is true and is of God.....Bullshit. Well, they don't say that last part...I added that in.   Our emotions are not good barometers for truth. I remember how I would sometimes feel emotional while hearing a church hymn or listening to an impassioned sermon from a seminary teacher or institute teacher. I also felt this same emotion even stronger when I was dancing in a moshpit and singing along while my  favorite hardcore punk band played on the stage. I was always happier and more blissful singing in the moshpit than singing at church. That dichotomy was always confusing to me.",529,14,0,0,1,1,®

t5_2r9vp,Burselfnow,1329229952,"&gt;Rather then attempting to petition industry giants like PepsiCo® and NESTLÉ® to make a change, we can take a stand now and make the change ourselves. The easiest way to stop supporting bottled water, is to stop buying bottled water! And the easiest way to stop buying bottled water, is to purchase a reusable water bottle!  &gt;The New York Times states that the average American consumer spends nearly $1,400 a year on bottled water. If these consumers drank the same amount of water, but obtained it from their kitchen faucet instead, they would have spent only $0.49 in the same year!  &gt;When faced with these numbers, it is an easy decision to purchase a reusable water bottle. But which one to choose? There are so many reusable water bottles on the market from aluminum, to glass, to BPA-free polycarbonate plastic bottles. These reusable bottles will often crack, dent, and break fairly easily. Furthermore, NONE of these options are biodegradable! The Hemp Bottle will be more durable than these options as well as being completely biodegradable, providing an easy choice for consumers. Industrial hemp grows in abundance in many parts of the world and produces the STRONGEST natural fiber known to man. Additionally, hemp requires little to no pesticides to grow, making it a very environmentally friendly organism. Hemp is an extremely impressive plant with many people claiming that it has over 1,000 uses.  From their website.  It makes sense too, anything that is created to be disposed of is not technically 'green' no matter how fast it biodegrades.",1022,48,0,0,1,1,®

For instance, if a friend comes to me and says he’s found dragon’s scales in his garden I will not cite “studies” that dragons do not exist but rather go with him to see what it is and why he makes his assumption.  For example, a friend actually asked me if WD-40®  would be a good fish attractant.  I did not ridicule him or question his intelligence.  I could have cited “studies” that proved that fish did not like petroleum at all but took this strange puzzle online and found out, indeed, that WD-40 was used as a fish attractant - a finding that amazed me.  It seems that fish oil is included in the formula and fish cannot “smell” the petroleum but could smell the fish oil.

So hey, why not, right? :-)   The Greatest Show On Earth is absolutely fantastic, and though I don't like Dawkins as an ""atheist apologist"" for lack of a better word, he is a fantastic biology teacher and I strongly recommend you pick that up.  If you like to watch videos, here's some that really helped me:  [Evolution](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vss1VKN2rf8) by Qualiasoup gave me a concise and accurate overview of evolution. [His whole channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/qualiasoup/#g/u) is filled to the brim with videos that are so clear, well laid out and simple, they absolutely transformed the way I viewed the world.  Also check out the channel of QualiaSoup's brother, [TheraminTrees](http://www.youtube.com/user/TheraminTrees/videos). He's a bit more creative, but clearly follows the same style.  If you have an afternoon to spare, check out [these video series](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA0C3C1D163BE880A&amp;feature=plcp) by Evid3nc3. It's an in-depth story about how he turned from a True Christian® to an atheist and what stages he went through. It's very personal and very recognizable at times - it actually made me cry. Well worth watching and you'll learn a lot about the bible's background in the process.  You can't be serious all the time, so just for giggles, I'm going to have to include [the parodies made by Edward Current](http://www.youtube.com/user/EdwardCurrent#grid/user/8DF8CC5D7E2A5011).  Book-wise I recommend anything by Bart Ehrmann, a New Testament scholar. If you're an avid reader, there's this book called A History of God by Karen Armstrong which lays out the history of the Judeo-Christian god. It's *very* information-dense so you'll probably read only a few pages at a time and feel absolutely knackered afterwards. Nevertheless, insanely interesting and an absolute mindfuck.

Dr P, from a midwestern, mid-sized city, said that at her Catholic-owned hospital, approval for termination of pregnancy was rare if a fetal heartbeat was present (even in “people who are bleeding, they're all the way dilated, and they're only 17 weeks”) unless “it looks like she's going to die if we don't do it.” In another case, Dr H, from the same Catholic-owned hospital in the Midwest, sent her patient by ambulance 90 miles to the nearest institution where the patient could have an abortion because the ethics committee refused to approve her case.  &gt;&gt;    She was very early, 14 weeks. She came in … and there was a hand sticking out of the cervix. Clearly the membranes had ruptured and she was trying to deliver… . There was a heart rate, and [we called] the ethics committee, and they [said], “Nope, can't do anything.” So we had to send her to [the university hospital]… . You know, these things don't happen that often, but from what I understand it, it's pretty clear. Even if mom is very sick, you know, potentially life threatening, can't do anything.  &gt;In residency, Dr P and Dr H had been taught to perform uterine evacuation or labor induction on patients during inevitable miscarriage whether fetal heart tones were present or not. In their new Catholic-owned hospital environment, such treatment was considered a prohibited abortion by the governing ethics committee because the fetus is still alive and the patient is not yet experiencing “a life-threatening pathology” such as sepsis. Physicians such as Dr H found that in some cases, transporting the patient to another hospital for dilation and curettage (D&amp;C) was quicker and safer than waiting for the fetal heartbeat to stop while trying to stave off infection and excessive blood loss. Dr B, an obstetrician–gynecologist working in an academic medical center, described how a Catholic-owned hospital in her western urban area asked her to accept a patient who was already septic. When she received the request, she recommended that the physician from the Catholic-owned hospital perform a uterine aspiration there and not further risk the health of the woman by delaying her care with the transport.  &gt;&gt;    Because the fetus was still alive, they wouldn't intervene. And she was hemorrhaging, and they called me and wanted to transport her, and I said, “It sounds like she's unstable, and it sounds like you need to take care of her there.” And I was on a recorded line, I reported them as an EMTALA [Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act] violation. And the physician [said], “This isn't something that we can take care of.” And I [said], “Well, if I don't accept her, what are you going to do with her?” [He answered], “We'll put her on a floor [i.e., admit her to a bed in the hospital instead of keeping her in the emergency room]; we'll transfuse her as much as we can, and we'll just wait till the fetus dies.”  &gt;Ultimately, Dr B chose to accept the patient to spare her unnecessary suffering and harm, but she saw this case as a form of “patient dumping,” because the patient was denied treatment and transported while unstable.",20744,607914,0,0,1,1,©

Impressionist influence first made its appearance in this piece with the pop-stippling techniques apparent on the orphan's clothing, which has long been theorized—especially noted by Charles Baudelaire in his last works on the transition point from sociochromatic representation to semiotic icon—to communicate complex themes of ""hope"" and ""smiles"" which should be presumedly denoted by the students outside of the school.

t5_2r2jt,trogladora,1329502566,".4. Being OK  One day, you’re not going to think about this every day. It may be hard to believe that. I know that whenever something really bad happens to me—not just big traumas, like sexual assault, but also relatively normal but awful things, like losing a job or a relationship—I’m convinced that I won’t ever get over it. And in some ways, I never do. I’ll never have that job again. I’ll never be loved by that person again. For the rest of my life, my life will be different, because something was lost. And I’ll never go back to being someone who hasn’t been sexually assaulted. That’s something else I lost. A big something. My life would be different if that hadn’t occurred.  These things still hurt, sometimes. All of them do, the little ones and the big ones. They all still sometimes break my heart. But I’m older now than I used to be. So I know, now, what happens when the heartbreak is over.  The end of heartbreak is not, generally, big. It doesn’t announce itself. No one comes to your door with a brass band and crowns you King of Over It and plays the Glorious Anthem of Recovery. It’s just this: one day, you’ll be sad about what happened. You’ll sit there, with the sadness, expecting it to break you; you’ll expect to go right back to the heart of the pain, the messy animal howling part that you were always so sure would never go away. And then you won’t go back there. And in that moment, you’ll realize something: you haven’t actually been there for a long time.  “Being OK” isn’t a celebration. “Being OK” isn’t a guarantee that you’ll never feel the pain again. “Being OK” is summed up in six words: that happened a long time ago.  This has changed you. It is always going to be something that has changed you, for the rest of your life. It will pop up in ways that surprise you. There will be days when the pain is back. If you have post-traumatic stress, you are not going to have an easy time of this. You are going to have to walk through more than most to get to “OK,” and you may have to keep walking back to it, over and over. But you are not alone, and help exists, and “the rest of your life” is hopefully going to be a very long time. One day, all of this will have happened a long time ago. That’s what I can tell you, about being OK.  And the fact is, you are not ruined. You are not broken. You are not forbidden to be OK. I actually felt guilty about this, when I realized it was happening to me—I thought there was some rule that meant I would only ever get to be bravely suffering and sort of all right, and that if I were actually happy, it would mean that I had betrayed myself and my experience. But this is not a 19th-century novel about a fallen woman; this is your actual life. No rule or event can forbid you from being happy. You can get past “OK.” You can get way past “OK.” You can actually get to “great.” That’s where a lot of the sexual assault survivors I’ve met have ended up: GREAT. So I’m not telling you that you have to be happy now. I’m telling you that it’s possible, and common. And one day, you might end up there, and not even realize it until you take a second to look around.  No matter where you are, though, you are not drowning, right now. But you are in the water, and it’s dangerous. So you have to grab the rope that leads you back to the boat. I am not the rope; I am talking to you so that you know the rope exists; I am talking to you so that you have a few ideas of how to make it to “OK” again. You’re out there in the water, and I’m just telling you to look around for something that’s going to save you.  Because primarily—here is the big secret, the part I wish someone had told me—you are what’s going to save you. Doctors can help you, and you’ll be the one who visits them. People can be trustworthy and capable of helping you heal, if you reach out—you’ll be the one who reaches. You may need to get past a bad relationship with a chemical, or a bad relationship with yourself—you’ll be the one who gets past it, the only one in the world who has that power. And maybe, on some days, you are going to literally save your own life.  I know you can do this. I know it. Because look at what happened to you. Look at what you’ve been through. And then, take a second to notice this part: it happened, and you are still here. Not just here, but reading an article on the internet about how to save yourself! And you’ve made it to the second to last paragraph! And it is a LONG article.  We call one another “survivors.” We don’t often take the time to think about what that means. What it means is “the people who are still here.” What it means is that you faced down something that no one should ever have to. And that even this terrible thing was not enough to stop you. What it means is that you are incredibly strong, even in the moments when you don’t know that. What it means is that you are not drowning—there is a rope, a lifeline, and it will bring you back to the boat, and back to safety. What it means is that you are the rope. Grab on. ♦",654,15,0,0,0,1,♦

t5_2qplv,loveismyreligion,1329503905,"I'm glad I'm not the only one who feels this way! :)  At the risk of sounding slightly like a creeper... when I was little, I used to peer into living room windows when I passed by walking on the street or riding in a car. I was always really curious about what other people were doing/feeling/thinking. The only real insight I had was into the lives of my own family, friends, and self. (A limited, albeit microcosmic worldview.)  The internet makes understanding people a lot easier. If they reveal themselves (something social networks like facebook and twitter and communities like reddit are encouraging) you can know their thoughts, motivations, political persuasions (/feelings of apathy), what they're interested in, what their friends/family/work relationships are like, even books they've read (/whether they read), etc etc.   This is all *extraordinarily* fascinating as someone who's always loved studying people.  Also.. it's almost as if there's a kind of collective consciousness created on the digital highway. Like if you're tuned into it, you can better sense what the general populace is thinking. This is becoming intensified the more people share. It trips me out a lot, and also makes me excited for the future. Could we, perhaps, have algorithms exposing how the masses are feeling? How healthy we are? Could there be a government of the future which responds with rational nurturing policies for best protecting people?   I have this sort of.. I've been calling it a *technosocialist* sense.. that this is possible. Inspired, rational socialist policies arising from: the power of consciously evolved human beings (who understand the importance of empathy, creativity, science/understanding nature, connection with the inner and outer world, etc) + our immensely powerful inner processors (our brainz) + the digital processing power of computers + internet where people expose themselves/their needs...  I'm talking healthcare, housing, keeping people safe through nourishing minds &amp; bodies, fostering creativity, innovation, intelligence... we focus far too much on military protection, which is important given the current state of the world [though I hope to experience a future (or at least help build the foundation for a future) where we don't even need military], but we have greater things threatening the US than terrorism/other countries. Like lack of intelligence and creativity and nurturing care! We all need some more love, really. Self love, friendship love, romantic love, neighborly love, community love (in digital *and* physical communities), governmental love, worldly love, cosmic love. That's how I see it.  At the risk of being a dweebo, I like talking about this kind stuff.. so anyone feel free to connect with me here, wherever. Y'know. I'm on the [twitter](http://twitter.com/#!/allyssamilan) and stuff.  I was also considering starting a subreddit to talk about these kinds of things... ideas for/examples of how we can experience a better/kinder/more intelligent future... unless this subreddit already exists, in which case do tell me about it... but, IDK! (I wouldn't be able to do it alone!)  Anyway. Before I ramble on waay too much... because I have a tendency to do such a thing and subsequently wonder whether anyone actually reads my probably incoherent ramblings......  Here's [a picture of me being fondled](http://i.imgur.com/Kuqyl.jpg). I consented to it, btw.

t5_2fwo,Jasper1984,1329512828,"The thing^\* that sucks the most for me is shell, easily. I mean, every time i come anywhere close to using it as a programming language somewhat it bites me. I want when regexing happens to be clean and contained.(the editor can be more free)  It also has no way to show something else than (text)input/output. Still not.. Stuff printed to `/dev/stderr` is shown, then why not have a `/dev/image`, embedding an application or something so commands can show an image or some such right on the terminal, right after invocation.  Doing that will also inhibit the creation of mathematica-like programs which basically uselessly add a layer(on multiple levels, multithreading↔just running more programs, some kind of objects↔files) and possibly restrict people to a programming language.   Some of these improvements need some convention set people somewhat agree on. For editors, there is little effect in terms of 'inter-usabilty' for different people, so there is very little merit in discussing that. But for other things, it makes things useless for some people. For instance a gui program not showing its functionality in a programmatic manner.  Also I actually kindah like emacs, largely it is very good.. I guess not having multiple windows *very much* should be solved. And i guess i could try find fancier ways to visualize and select the buffers that i have, just to know. he only point on emacs i dislike is how *terrible* the bookmarks selector was for me until i started using tab-completion much.

t5_2qh1i,LincolnshireSausage,1329516255,"I work in the real estate industry, not as a Realtor® fortunately. It is tough to make money as a Realtor and many Realtors do it as a retirement job or as additional income to another job. They do not have any guaranteed income from selling houses. The only way they earn money is to sell a house. The listing agent and the selling agent split the commission on the house. On a $200000 house the commission might be 6% and this is split two ways. If it is an even split the agent may make $6000. If the Realtor sells 6 houses a year then they will take home $36000 before tax. Add to this the MLS fees, brokerage fees and the cost of continuing real estate education that they are required to take and you can see that they do not make much money. Because their income is directly related to the cost of houses in recent years Realtors have seen their income drop dramatically.   The Realtor you did not buy the house from spent a lot of his time researching houses for you and showing you them. He has not been paid one cent for doing this and now they have lost the sale there is no chance of any income for all of the work they have done. The Realtor now sees this as wasted time. He could have used this time more productively showing houses to other prospects or canvasing for new prospects. Imagine if you went to work for a couple of weeks and then found out you were not going to get paid for it.  I can understand the Realtor's frustration. He basically sold you the house and then you closed the deal with someone else who took his commission for doing next to nothing. It certainly was not very professional of him to say you cheated him and his family. I am sure he did not answer his phone, got back to you late and got J's name wrong because he is working his butt off trying to support his family. Again, it's not very professional of him but these are not fun times for Realtors. He may be having difficulty in making his own mortgage payments because of the recent drop in house prices. There are also less people buying houses due to the economic downturn and due to banks being more strict as to who qualifies for mortgages. Each Realtor/brokerage has a slightly different method of selling you a house within the rules for their MLS. He may not have been the best Realtor and he may have been trying to cut some corners so he can get more work done and have a better chance of supporting his family but what you did was not cool.   The best way to find a good Realtor is to get recommendations from other people who have bought a house recently. If they have had a good experience then chances are you will too. Buying a house is a probably the largest investment you will make and you should not just call someone out of the blue who you know nothing about. There are good and bad Realtors just like there is good and bad in any profession and you need to make damn sure that you pick the right one before you start looking for a house. 80% of Realtors today will not be Realtors in 5 years time; most find it much too difficult to make anywhere near the amount of money they were expecting to make. On the other hand, the good Realtors usually are very good. This guy may not have been the best Realtor but I know he wants to earn money and because of that I am sure he would have sold you the house. It would also not be in his best interest to have not submitted the offer on the first house. He will never make money if he does not submit offers.",29672,5229,0,0,1,1,®

In the dream, S.W. envisioned that he was abandoned in a lifeboat off the isle Cozumel in the Gulf of Mexico. Having been stranded for days with no food nor sweetwater, his days of barren existence finally were broken my an anthropomorphized alligator who spoke to him from the water of Ancient Egyptian Steles unrecovered. A devout Lutheran Anarchochristian at the time—a learning brought to him by Dadaist Tristan Tzara during the early 1940's—S.W.'s dream-self threatened the alligator with a flaregun in the lifeboat. The alligator plunged deep into the oceanic abyss, and just as S.W. turned away, it resurfaced with a sawed-off shotgun in retaliation.  In lieu of the Deep Horizon Oil Superexplosion, the artist enchanted his fevered dreamscape with a shitty, gasoline rainbow, which the alligator has here been depicting as taking refuge behind the homosexual pride-slick.

t5_2rb5s,movermeyer,1329622974,"[WaterWorks©](http://www.trademarkia.com/waterlooworks-85028720.html) was either the 2nd or 3rd time that the university has started projects to replace JobMine. (which came into full use in 2004, after designs for it started in [1999](http://asclub.uwaterloo.ca/20110228_Issue03_Final.pdf))  WaterlooWorks was formally cancelled on February 22nd, 2011, by the Provost at the time. At that point, it had been through two rounds of beta testing with the School of Architecture students, failing miserably both times since it didn't scale well to multiple users. Since then, the university has recognized that it has to support JobMine for longer than anticipated. (They were counting on WaterlooWorks to succeed and hadn't been trying to improve JobMine) This led to some UI changes being pushed through last August (relatively minor, but still nice none-the-less) and the 'endorsement' of student written 'addons' like [JobMine Plus](http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/80771).  The official word from the university is that they are looking into software packages they can purchase from various companies, (In a similar way to Quest and LEARN) and modify to suit the 'surprisingly complex' rules of the UW registrar.  If you're interested, you can read a blog post from a student who was involved in the WaterlooWorks project about his opinions on [why the project failed](http://whoyoucallingajesse.com/past/2011/02/27/what-happened-to-the-new-co-op-system-at-uwaterloo/).  Also, you check out the [previous thread on this topic](http://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/pg9mc/on_the_possibility_of_opensourcing_jobmine/) (it sounds like you already have)  Overall, there is no new development happening by the university, although I think that the students would like to see some transparency surrounding why the previous projects failed. (Source code, documentation, reports, etc.) Especially since the project cost [$2.7 million dollars](http://iwarrior.uwaterloo.ca/pdf/w11i4.pdf) (Page 11) ",729,647,0,0,1,1,©

The big black rectangular block stands out from the charcoal page background, like it doesn't really fit - if you put a video player ▶ button and a scroll bar on the page then I can recognise a video player without needing the ""press to play"" text to label it.   I appreciate that ""press to play"" is a call to action, however personally I am unlikely to watch a video if I can possibly get the information in any other way. I can read text much more quickly than someone can recite it to me, and I'm going to assume that a video is going to waste my time with animations, music and fade-ins and outs.  I may not be typical, and I may not be your demographic, but to me a video says that you're going to waste my time marketing crap to me and that you don't actually have anything I want.

t5_2cneq,physicscat,1329688773,"First - minimum wage jobs, at hourly pay, are not meant to be ""careers.""           Stocking shelves and running a cash register are not careers,          they're jobs.  Second - salaried employees get benefits, because they have made              working at Wal-Mart a career in management.   Third - Times change. I used to love this little bookstore by my house called the Colony bookstore. After a while they couldn't keep up when larger bookstores came to Savannah. Not too long ago my favorite store Border's closed up here in Atlanta where I live now. Why? Their business model of choosing NOT to embrace internet sales and e-readers killed them.  Times change. There are grumblings that Congress should bail out newspapers that are dying. Why? Selling papers is obsolete in this day and age. Companies come and go. New innovators come in and are eventually replaced if they don't keep up with the times. Is it sad sometimes? Yes. But this is how the free-market works, and the great thing is, if your business fails, you can start another one, and another one. You can file for bankruptcy, restructure and start over.  I rarely visit Wal-Mart, it is not my favorite store, but as our society changes so must businesses and they if they can't compete so be it.   Oh, and they don't HAVE to seek public assistance. I know many people who CHOOSE to have video game consoles, UVerse and the like, top of the line cell phones, tricked out cars and smoke and drink, a lot. For the money they spend on cigarettes alone, they could afford to buy health insurance. I did when I was working an hourly job. I did not have a smart phone, I chose my internet connection over TV, I chose not to purchase a video game console or any other expensive item until....wait for it....I could afford to AFTER making sure I had the necessities, like health insurance.  So as for the health insurance thing....if you live in America, are given a free education, food stamps, housing, and more and more and more, and you STILL can't do better than an hourly wage job, you're making bad decisions and living with the consequences. Those of us who made good decisions, unfortunately are still having to support you.   Stop blaming Wal-Mart. If all you aspire to is running a cash register, you made a decision, now live with it.

Enthusiastic and lively, but shy. &gt; &gt;2. Always because I am able to achieve things that I couldn’t have done alone. &gt; &gt;3. Each of the member’s charms and the energy we have onstage. &gt; &gt;4. Seohyun because even though she’s the youngest of the group, she can take care of herself well. &gt; &gt;5. P!nk’s ‘Dear My President’, ‘Perfect’, Bruno Mars and James Morrison &gt; &gt;6. I want to have one thing that I can proudly say that I am confident in. &gt; &gt;8.

A date where we eat, drink coffee and talk?  &gt;**Sunny** &gt; &gt;1989/B &gt; &gt;Talks well and is the mood maker of the group. &gt; &gt;*“When I participated in shows alone, I felt thankful to the members.”* &gt; &gt;1. Optimistic &gt; &gt;2. When we go on stage. Because the members have a good relationship with each other, we have never been bored even in other countries. &gt; &gt;3. Teamwork. &gt; &gt;4. Tiffany because she gets along well with others. &gt; &gt;5. Tamia’s ‘Officially Missing You’. &gt; &gt;6. Because I still have a lot more to improve in every perspective, I think I have to work harder.  &gt;7. WheeSung.

I want to study more on music, because I want to become a singer who can present any kind of song well. &gt; &gt;8.  I feel really happy when I watch DVD movies on my own in the room. &gt; &gt;9.  From the opposite gender, it will be “Your song is great” or “You sing well”. From the same gender, it will be“Your skin looks great”. &gt; &gt;10.

Boys II Men’s ‘End of the road’, Bruno Mars’ ‘Just, the way you are’ (This song is nice!) &gt; &gt;6.  It’s important to always build my character and constantly try to upgrade myself. &gt; &gt;8.  When I got my driving license. &gt; &gt;9. If they add an “I knew that you are…” before their compliments, it gives me the feeling that they trust me. &gt; &gt;10.

t5_2ryfy,mainliner53,1329784651,"&gt;Because it's wrong to believe in things without any evidence.  I take it that your answer is that it is wrong because it is wrong. Kind of a circular logic, but if it works for you…     &gt;What do you mean by this, and how would you prove it?   God is personal and one with whom a human being can enter into a relationship as a creature with the Creator. We call that relationship faith. I can’t prove it. I don’t need to. I have a relationship with my parents, but I cannot prove it. You can, however, witness the effects in my life. Once again, I must remind you that I have stated several times that God’s existence is not in the realm of the testable, measurable or quantifiable. One can however, talk to God. God can communicate with human beings and has. A person can love God and live in a way that he or she believes would be pleasing to God. If a person doesn’t have that relationship he or she cannot somehow measure or test another person’s relationship. You may deny it, or mock it, or wonder about it. But that really doesn’t matter.    &gt;It's a outline description of the process. Evidence would be linking you to fossils etc.   I realize that it is an outline. I also know that the fossil record fits in there. The only segment I was interested in is the proof (or evidence) that inert matter transformed itself into purposeful, self-reflective, intelligent minds. That final step (or steps). Somehow fossils just doesn’t do the trick.    &gt;I wish you'd stop jumping straight to concluding that there's little evidence before you've even given me a change to explain.   I did not jump to any conclusions. I asked the question only.   &gt;Could you please answer my question on which you believe (agree with) and which you don't?   I accept and understand each stage in the outline you offered as a plausible description of what is thought to have taken place in the evolutionary process of physical matter. I don’t disagree with any of the purported stages. These stages, however, have yet to be proved. Much of the evidence is lacking and the overall process is simply plausible guesses. I find no reason to not believe that the physical universe unfolded in those or similar stages. Such belief is not a matter of certain knowledge. I do not find the stages objectionable. So I am eager for you to alert me to the way inert matter transformed into thinking matter.   &gt;It's nothing to do with ""belief"", it's just definitions.   It sounds as though you really like to avoid the words believe or belief. I find those to be useful words. I offered a definition of the word purpose on several occasions. Maybe you missed it. I also contrasted it with tastiness. Purpose, while immeasurable and unquantifiable (like other abstract nouns such as honor, dignity, love, hope) can be defined. We know what we mean when we speak of purpose. What I think you mean is that tastiness and purpose both derive from personal preferences. I figured that you think that (I avoided the word believe although it would be equally useful in normal conversational English to employ it).   If purpose and tastiness are only matters of personal preference, so be it. Hitler had a purpose to elevate the Aryan race to world dominance in the name of the Third Reich for the glory of the German peoples. He found Jews distasteful (not related to the taste buds in this case). His program proceeded accordingly. Both were his personal preferences.  Some  people opposed him because they preferred a different world.      &gt;I simply gave you my understand of the word. You want to define the word ""purpose"" differently, do so. Give me an example experiment which would determine what the purpose of something is.   Now Joeflux, c’mon ☺I have previously stated that there is no such experiment to determine the purpose of a thing. I guess I must repeat myself, but as a teacher I have learned that repetition is a valued teaching tool ☺. Some simple things we know have a purpose, like a hammer. One can demonstrate its use, but there is not experiment that determines that. Human beings make tools for human purposes. If we chance upon a gizmo and don’t know what it is or what it is used for, our best bet is to consult the person who made it (as in your example of an author of a book). Or we may identify something comparable of which we already know the purpose and surmise that this artifact may have a similar purpose. Some artifacts discovered in archeological digs still puzzle us as to their purpose. Experiments aren’t really appropriate or helpful to discover purpose.      &gt;In my definition, an example would be that you could ask a writer what the purpose of his book is, and he might tell you that it's to make money. But the book reader might say that the purpose of the book is gain enjoyment. Thus, from this definition, we can easily see that the purpose of an object is subjective. If you meant something else by purpose, simply give me a definition and an experiment to determine what the purpose of something is.   I never implied that I meant anything else by the word purpose.   &gt;Then it's completely meaningless to ask whether human life has purpose since you've left the word undefined.    I did not leave the word undefined. I defined it. I will cut and past my last sentences from my previous post above. Here is what I offered as a definition of purpose: “I use the word purpose to mean rationale, intention, goal, raison d’etre, whatever.” Other definitions of the word purpose are available also in English language dictionaries). One is “reason for existence.” Another is “desired effect.” As a verb it means to “set something as a goal”.   &gt;You might as well have as whether people have flurgles and then refused to define what flurgle means.  That is really  humorous but is a silly example. I used the word purpose and defined it as well.   &gt;You can start by sharing your own purpose for living. Under your unmeasurable and unquantified definition? It's a meaningless question. How would I determine something that is undeterminable? :-)   That is a clever parry but it appears to me that you are evading the question. Do you mean that you have never reflected on the purpose in your own life? It is not a meaningless question at all. Purpose is not indeterminable. I never stated that purpose is indeterminable. I opined that experiments are not correct method to yield a purpose. Although I will admit that in limited ways experiments may help us understand purpose, as, for example, when a series of medical experiments assist us to determine the purpose of some gland, the excretion of which we did not know its benefit.   It seems that you have contradicted yourself. Above, you gave a good example asking an author the purpose of a book that he or she wrote. It was not a nonsense question at all. While it is not measurable or quantifiable, it is not indeterminable. The author, in your example, stated a purpose that is plausible. Of course, it could be that the author stated a purpose that was not the real purpose either by way of deception, or because he or she wrongly perceived their own purpose. Often our own human hearts can deceive us. Humans are often a bundle of conflicting and contradictory passions that subvert our own motives and hide our intentions.   Some people report that their purpose is to serve humanity, but the real purpose may be to get money, be well thought of, or to bask in popularity and public approval. But those are side issues.    One of the crises in public education is clarify the purpose of the whole educational enterprise. Purpose, (in dealing with these meta-ethical issues) relates to the field of philosophy we might call teleology. The state is often conflicted over the appropriate purpose and goal into which it chooses to educate a young person. In totalitarian states the purpose of education is often to shape compliant citizens.          When we state a purpose it usually means that we have thought about the end goals and established a reason for pursuing them. Some atheists have a definite purpose, or goal, to convert theists to atheism. Purpose is not a nonsense question at all. I am surprised that you would dismiss it as such. Perhaps I have misunderstood you.  My question is,  “do you think there is a purpose for human existence?” If that sounds too lofty, then try this question,  “Do you have a purpose (a goal a passion) in your life?

Modern plastic-lined cables have made the use of grease inappropriate, because the viscosity of the grease makes for sluggish cable movement. This is a more critical concern with modern brake and gear systems that use weaker return springs, and with indexed shifting in general.  &gt;Many manufacturers now recommend against using any lubrication on cables. It certainly should be avoided in the case of sealed systems such as Gore-Tex ®. Bicycles used in wet conditions, however, will often benefit by the application of a bit of oil, more as a rust-preventive than as a lubricant. The area of particular concern is the short loop of housing which carries the rear derailer cable around from the chainstay to the derailer.  &gt;Some bicycles provide awkward cable routing which forces housing to enter cable stops/adjusting barrels at a fairly sharp angle. This is particularly common on rear cantilever brakes. It often helps to put a bit of grease on the bit of cable that runs through such fittings.

t5_2qioo,CaringBro,1329836169,"&gt;I've tried removing the battery and booting on AC power, and nothing happens. My best guess is that the battery drained (likely, since I didn't plug the computer in to recharge before I went to sleep, which I usually do) and that something is wrong with the cord that plugs into the outlet.  * I doubt that there is some problem with the battery since it should work just fine without the AC adapter.  &gt;Thanks, but ""taking the memory out"" sounds way over my head in terms of complexity. I wouldn't even know where to find the memory.  * Most of the time taking out me memory isn't really hard. Just unscrew one panel on the bottom and you can see it, then just slight pressure on both sides of the memory and you can take it out. *  Check out this site: [link](http://www.insidemylaptop.com/category/1-acer-laptops/) and go through the various models they have disassembled, I'm not sure which type your laptop is, on the bottom of the page you can go to the 'Previous Entries' they have also done.   * Here is a picture of a backside of an Acer Aspire laptop [link](http://www.insidemylaptop.com/images/Acer-Aspire-One/take-apart-netbook-14.jpg)   Not sure if you still have warranty or not, if you have you should contact your supplier, about the issue.  Personally I think this issue has something to do with your bios sadly, which is hard(almost impossible, in most cases) to repair with out replacing the motherboard it self.  To conclude that it is indeed some issue with the motherboard you need to do some things:  * Try to boot without battery on AC adapter only. ✔ * Remove memory and place back.   After that you can pretty much conclude that it is indeed the motherboard or something with the power but you stated something about the lights:  &gt;All that happens is the light on the front that usually indicates the battery is charging goes on and stays on if I hit the power button, but otherwise there's absolutely nothing happening.  So I think in that case it really is the motherboard, if you can conclude that you will need to or contact the supplier or replace the motherboard yourself.

t5_2qh1i,MichaelCarter,1329852087,"Per your arguments:   1)	I agree that paying statutory royalties for samples stifles creativity.  If one purpose of copyright is to provide exclusive rights to the copyright holder to sell his/her work (or if the copyright has been transferred, someone else’s work) so as to encourage future creativity, I don’t think this applies to sampling.  Sampling to me is like using Heinz Ketchup to make a proprietary Asian BBQ sauce.  Of course, if you are sampling Heinz Ketchup to make Kentucky’s Finest Ketchup, there may be a problem.    2)	 Legislating royalty rates is an attempt to correct a perceived market failure, i.e. the idea that if you create a work, you will be able to monitor and demand contractual royalty arrangements with all of the commercial users of that work.  In theory, I agree with you.  It would be great to have the market regulate this.  Some artists may be fine with a much smaller royalty rate and their music would be consumed/used on a broader scale.  Other artists would require very high royalty rates and their music would not be consumed/used on as high a scale.  But in practice, I think this would result in large scale market failure and a higher end-cost to the consumer/user in the form of higher overhead to negotiate / enforce varying licensing arrangements (see the Movie Industry).    3)	I think the point you raise in your third argument bolsters my response to your second argument.  It is not copyright’s fault that so many musicians and screenwriters sell away their work in return for license fees, option fees, royalties, and the like.  That is the very market at play that you claim should handle royalty rates.  No one forces an up and coming screenwriter to, when optioning a screenplay, agree to also sell the copyright in the work and all derivative works to the big time studio that is in turn paying them $30,000 upfront plus an additional $30,000 upon use of the work.  That is a market arrangement.  And if you don’t want to agree to that, then perhaps you should find a movie producer/distributor that will allow you to keep your copyright and risk putting several millions of dollars into production/distribution.  (they do not exist)  In addition, almost all professional screenwriters belong to the screenwriters’ guild, which further protects the creators by imposing preset royalty rates, licensing fees, option fees, etc.  If anything, it could be argued that without copyright protection, the big studios could just prowl the ether for great screenplays and produce them without paying anything to the content creator.  Although I can’t imagine why anyone would spend two years of their life toiling over a 130-page story written for the big screen without knowing that there was gonna be some way of being rewarded for the fruits of their labor.  Copyright law, and derivative agreements (i.e. guild arrangements), allow for content creators to be awarded for their work.  Whether a given content creator chooses a licensing arrangement or selling arrangement is up to that person.  It could further be argued that with the advent of the series of tubes, distribution channels for independent content creators are broader and more easily accessible than ever before, and are only increasing.  But unchecked use of these channels would again, defeat the motivations for someone to create a lot of the best content out there today.  (See The Dark Knight, L O S T, Soul Caliber, Billy Joel, The Hunger Games, etc.)    4)	I agree with almost everything you said starting with “Every work is a derivative of some other work…” The fact that Fox, Disney, SONY, insert generic big studio name, owns lots of stuff that it did not create has many implications.  But if there was a copyright on that work, and Disney paid for it, that still means that a transaction was made.  Disney found value in that work, purchased it.  The content creator wanted money, thought it equal to trade IP for money.  Win-Win.  Is it fair that George Lucas’s heirs for the next seven decades will own Star Wars and everything associated with it?  NO.  So I think there needs to be a balance.  And the lobbying power of these big companies is obviously stronger than the lobbying powers of the collective content creator counterparts (good use of alliteration), hence long statutory copyright terms.  But, in my opinion, the fundamental basis for this copyright is still sound.  The idea that if I create something that took effort, not only should I be able to be justly compensated for that production, but I should also have a financial motivation for creating it in the first place.  Without copyright, we’d be stuck with movies like The Human Centipede and music by Crispin Glover. (exaggeration, but you get my point)  I personally like the music, movies, videogames, tv shows, etc. that have been produced over the past 100 years and am a firm believer that the best of this stuff would not have been made if the world treated copyright the way China does.  I don’t think you are advocating that it does, but I do think that your approach would get us closer to that and farther away from what we have.  Is the system we have perfect?  Of course not.  I agree that terms need to be drastically shorter, fair use needs to be better defined, and in many cases, more permissive.  And statutory licensing and royalty fees should reflect what is fair not from the content distributor’s perspective, but for the content creator’s perspective.  That being said, this work in progress called the copyright act, as it struggles to adapt to emerging technologies, still rests on solid foundations.

t5_2r5ng,tomhodgins,1329854112,"came here to post this very idea:  I have been wondering why, when Android has had the player app for MONTHS, even when they gave away an iPad2, iPad still has no player app. Rumour says it was held up on Apple's end, but arriving soon.  There's also a rumoured launch of iPad3 next month, and this wouldn't be the first time a feature that's possible on multiple devices has been artificially restricted for a sales point alone.  Siri, the flagship feature of the iPhone 4S, was originally designed to run on iPhone 3 and ran stable on 3GS, 4, and 4S. There was no reason the restrict it, but they have sold many phones this way.  Think of iMovie, it's only for iPhone4+ and iPad2 - even though editing videos is something iPad1 is fully capable of (and a simple hack lets you install it, so this has been proven to work well on iPad1).  We've got a missing iPad Onlive client, and an Onlive Desktop service 'coming soon'.  This is the year Windows® hits the cloud with Nivio, Onlive Desktop and more - having an iPad-exclusive app to do this (for a while) would be a huge selling feature for my *business* users looking for an iPad3. Also rumoured to have resolutions greater than most desktops, the iPad 3 would be the *best* way to view your computer over VNC or remote desktop.  I fear that the Onlive Player app and Onlive Desktop service will arrive for iPad to coincide with the iPad3 launch, and if it is also restricted for iPhone or iPad1,2 to be used solely as a selling feature, I will simply go out and buy Android.  I've already sunk hundreds of dollars into iPhone and iPad apps, but the reason I've liked Apple instead of Microsoft for an OS I can run Adobe's software on is because until now Apple's software has always been cheap and available, and they used that good software to sell hardware. Now they are getting lazy, buying technologies instead of developing them, and artificially restricting software in order to pump more hardware sales.  I don't play games, and Apple's value to me will drop significantly depending on how this iPad3 launch is handled. I think they know it too.",3169,108,0,0,0,1,®

Thanks for telling people to enjoy it? No I'm not the best at the game or the most entertaining but I'm making an effort. As for stroking my ego, well I'm not but would you consider this rant of yours an ego stroking of your own?  &gt;Because hosting a charity stream is the only way anyone would ever give 2 fucks, and its not like there will be shit all put into the stream, guests, or gameplay besides a boring 24 hour ""oh god hes really tired"".  I have reached out to guests and different types of game play like [Divine Courage](http://divinecourage.dy.fi/) matches and playing with other streamers and content producers.  &gt;I would support this if there was A SINGLE MERIT TO WATCHING HIS STREAM, if he was demon, fear, maelk, etc I would upvote and say fuck yes. If it was someone from complexity, they would stream, have guests, and donate the stream income to charity, I would be all for it.  Thanks for pointing out that I'm none of those people I was getting worried about the confusion. On a more serious note I would love for any of them to come on and cast/play/join me. I do not make any stream income and if I did it would go to charity but because I don't donations to it will be the way to go I'm sorry I couldn't fulfill your need in this way.  &gt;But this is a 0 effort, stay awake, poor quality charity bullshit and no one would give 2 fucks except omg charity must upvote cuz I can't think for myself.  You probably don't know what ""effort"" is as anyone taking time out of their lives to do something like this is far from 0. I work a full time job, it is not like I have all the time in the world to sit around and plan these things. :) Also telling people they can't think for themselves because they support charity is pretty baseless but alright :)  Finally: Thanks for taking the time to express your opinions and I'll try and make this more exciting than you think it will be not that it matters because you refuse to watch. So while you're enjoying your saturday I'll enjoy mine :) Have a wonderful weekend sir :)",393,541,0,0,0,1,♥

t5_2qh61,originalkitten,1330002281,🌊IGood job you don't live in the uk and have kids. I'm on welfare because I'm very ill.  And money is very tight. I'm a single mum with two teenage boys.  I got paid £71 yesterday. I had to go food shopping as we ran out of food on Monday and were eating very strange concoctions of food. Anyway I digress. I only bought essentials and my bill came to £64. That leaves me with £7 until Tuesday. My son has to get to college (3x a week)which is £5 per day so already I'm £8 short. My other son needs £2 per day so now I'm £18 short and it's my late Mums birthday on Sunday and because it's 1)her first birthday without her and 2) should have been her 60th we want to do something for her so I've had to borrow money which leaves me up shit street next week.  Yes I have Internet and yes I have a cell. It's common practice here now for everybody to have Internet. The schools require you to have it as the children's home work is online and my eldest needs it as he is doing IT LEVEL 3 diploma.  I also require a cell for my children as one has severe asthma and Aspergers  and the other has Crps and asthma. I also need one as I fall quite a lot and also need to be able to phone home.  And we don't have food banks here well not in my town anyway.  So please don't be judgemental or make pre-conceptions about people and priorities. What maybe a luxury to you is an essential to others. ,1885,146,0,0,0,1,🌊

t5_2qhyh,BTownPhD,1330015332," It has barely been a couple of months so far since I bought my TGT and I have really enjoyed it.  Before the purchase, I was seriously considering the Garmin equivalent (310xt), but it a brand new TGT was much cheeper on amazon (HALF PRICE!).  But that was not the only selling point.  It came with the HRM and I picked up a cadence meter for my bike coming to a total cost of about $180.  Now if you are an Amazon Prime member you can save even more on the shipping and know that it is a quality purchase you have made.  Other selling points came from DCRainmaker &lt;http://www.dcrainmaker.com/2010/08/timex-ironman-gps-global-trainer-in.html&gt;  The review is the best so far, accurate, in depth and fair. The TGT It is universal with ANT+, so if you have any of those already (Garmin/Wahoo/Timex) it will sync up without a problem. The GPS works great too (or I am easily impressed). There were a lot of negative comments about the original firmware build but Timex has addressed this and put out a new easy to download/install firmware update. The day it came in the mail I updated the firmware and I haven’t really noticed any problems (except on rainy days).  Somewhere I came across the design and discovered that the GPS chip is actually right under the Start/Split button, which some watches burry beneath the screen.  I feel confident that this gives a better signal reliability but I am not a(n) mechanical/electrical engineer of any sort.  Inside the watch there are a lot of features, perhaps to many as there are tons I am still learning to learn how to use. Auto-start/stop, intervals, altimeter, pacers, cadence, power, alerts, indiglo®, multisport, navigate, and so many ways to configure on the watch or on your computer.  You have four screens that you can pretty much set to any combination of average/max/min HR, pace, altitude, split, distance and a few more I am forgetting. With all these things running at one time, the battery life is amazing, I charge it about once a week after using it for 5 or 6 workouts totaling about 6-8 hours of active GPS and or HRM and I still have 20-30% of the battery leftover. I have not tried my cadence meter yet (the weather sucks/I’m not that hardcore).  Now, the watch is big, people will notice it but big means easy to read screen even if you use the 4 screen split, and it feels surprisingly natural.  I put on a nicer watch to go out for Valentine's and my wrist felt naked and unbalanced.   The one problem I have had so far I have mentioned already though.  I was running late to a spin class, threw on my HRM and booted up the watch, clicked over to my bike/spin setting and pressed start/split and it froze.  I was distressed to say the least.  I finally found out how to restart it after applying several years of electronics use know-how (there just had to be someway to restart it, who wants a brick for a watch?). Later I found a number and called Timex to see why it froze, they said it happens and all you can do is manually reset it.  I was also informed that I would lose all of my data when I did that (I didn’t) but I wasn’t worried either as I download after every workout anyway.    I’m getting a little unorganized in my thoughts now but – simply, it’s a good watch and a great run-tracker/keeper for an amazing price, especially if you have never used one before.  I might switch to a Garmin in a few years – but only if I continue to grow more serious in my training.  The reason being that Garmin now has a watch that can do GPS tracking in open water.  Cool, but way out of my budget right now.  I’d be happy to answer any more specific questions too –   Cheers!  TL/DR? it’s a good watch and a great run-tracker/keeper for an amazing price for the number of features, especially if you have never used one before. ",1739,804,0,0,1,1,®
t5_2qh13,Sporadiskt,1330016135,"That is anectdotal evidence, based on your experience. Of course it is possible, but it is extremely unlikely. The american economic system is and has more or less always been biased against vertical social mobility. It would be nice if this idea of the 'American Dream®' was true, but it simply isn't from a statistical point of view.   Everyone from politicians to hollywood is peddling this false idea of working your way up from two empty hands. But for every success story, there are literally dozens that never make it, despite 'trying' as you put it. In fact I find it extremely offensive when someone says that people are poor because they don't try. The socio-economic factors behind poverty runs alot deeper than simply a lack of trying.

You have shit like this happening:  One Lilly advertisement shows a series of photographs of an uptight-looking model, and asks in the headline: “Distracted? Disorganized? Frustrated? Modern Life or Adult ADD?” The advertisement notes that adult ADD can go undiagnosed because “its symptoms are often mistaken for a stressful life.” The commercial suggests that readers get checked out by their physician, because Strattera®, the first approved medication for adult ADD, can help “you stay focused, so you can get things done at work and at home.”  The viewer might see this ad, go to the doctor, say they have some problem that isn't really worthy of getting medication, and then the doctors may give them the prescription that the patient asks for.  Especially if the doctor somehow gets some benefit from it (like you have to go back to the office once every few months for a new prescription).  Should this person necessarily be taking amphetamines every day to be more effective at work?  I don't know...  might not be a great trade off.  See that's where the issue comes from.

Yes, it can encourage you to be worse, but it gives people a place to know they're not alone. They're not the only one hding in a tub crying or stashing food in a closet and that maybe there's some hope.  If I had not stummbled across forums when I was at my worst and ready to kill myself I probably would have gone through with it. It helped me rationalize my hate a little, but with every person who posted a ""I'm off to hospital for recovery. ♥"" or ""I'm over hating myslef"" I saw I could do it too.  I see this as a solution similar to Winter Park's 'solution' to the homeless. Banning these things just means you don't see the problem anymore, it's like a city solving homelessness by running the homeless out of town. The problem is still there, it's just not one you have to deal with or see.  I think PSAs, links to recovery centers or information would be the best answer.

t5_2qh1i,GCanuck,1330106266,"Biodegradable / Compostable: What It Really Means  There are an awful lot of product claims being made with regard to biodegradable, compostable and degradable properties. It is fairly easy to become confused on exactly what is fact and what is spin. The first step is to define what these words actually mean. There are of course definitions that can be looked up and some even have definitions written by the ASTM (American Standards for Testing Materials) which we'll cover. But what is most important is what the average consumer thinks these terms mean. The American Chemistry Council did a study on this exact topic. They concluded that most people feel a product is biodegradable if it is able to break down naturally (on its own) in 1 year or less and leave nothing behind, or completely disappear. The FTC (Federal Trade Commission) has a very similar view on a biodegradable definition. They state that the ""...materials should break down in a reasonably short period of time after customary disposal.""  It is very important to get the facts on products that make a biodegradable claim. What are the conditions necessary for biodegradation to occur? There are some foamed polystyrene products on the market right now that are claiming they will biodegrade in a landfill environment. Some even offer a certificate signed by a company official, certifying the product will biodegrade in a landfill. According to the FTC however, in landfills, materials degrade very slowly, if at all. This is because modern landfills are designed, according to law, to keep out sunlight, air and moisture. This helps prevent pollutants from the garbage from getting into the air and drinking water, and slows the decomposition of the trash. In Dr. William Rathje's book entitled ""Rubbish,"" he sites that ""The truth is, however, that the dynamics of a modern landfill are very nearly the opposite of what most people think...Well designed and managed landfills seem to be far more apt to preserve their contents for posterity than transform them into humus or mulch. They are not vast composters: rather they are vast mummifiers."" In his book, Dr. Rathje talks about doing excavations on 15 landfills throughout North America. **From those digs, they found 40 year old newspapers that were still legible, 5 year old lettuce and a 15 year old hot dog. From these studies it seems fairly clear that even organic materials take a very long time to break down in landfills let alone plastic or other items.**  Compostable product claims are another hot topic today. Once again the American Chemistry Council surveyed consumers to find out what their definition of compostable is. Their study cited that most respondents felt that compostable items can be put back into the ground to make soil, mulch or fertilizer that can be used in a garden or around the home. They also go on to state that the chief attribute of compostable materials is that the decomposition is beneficial to the earth which stands in opposition to their biodegradable beliefs that materials simply disappear completely.  The ASTM also has a definition for compostable plastic products which some municipalities have mandated as their rule and guideline that packaging must meet. The ASTM D6400 definition is quite lengthy and very specific. It covers such points as time frames for decomposition and left over materials acceptable. You could find the entire ASTM D6400 definition on their website and read all the pages, but if you are looking for compostable products, we would recommend simply looking for products that carry the BPI logo. BPI is the Biodegradable Products Institute and is a not for profit organization that promotes the use of compostable materials and organics recovery via composting. They have a third party certification process that will verify if a manufacturers products meet the ASTM definition for compostability. Our Harvest® Fiber brand of products does meet these criteria and carries the BPI logo. This means that a third party has verified that all Harvest® Fiber; products will turn to compost within the time frame specified in the ASTM definition. It is important to note that these products must be sent to a professionally managed composting facility in order to be composted correctly. They will not compost in a back yard compost heap. They will however completely compost at a professionally run facility. We have also sought and received verification from such a facility, that our products will do what we say they will. To find a composting facility near you, click here.  It is safe to say that, from the facts listed above, nothing biodegrades in a landfill in a reasonable period of time.  Until there are tighter rules with regard to marketing claims for biodegradable and compostable products, it is really up to the consumer to do their homework. Simply because a product may be made from organic sources, one cannot assume it will biodegrade or even compost properly. Ask for third party verifications proving the claims are valid. If none exist, then the consumer must make their own decision. ",148582,1194,0,0,1,1,®

She came in … and there was a hand sticking out of the cervix. Clearly the membranes had ruptured and she was trying to deliver… . There was a heart rate, and [we called] the ethics committee, and they [said], “Nope, can't do anything.” So we had to send her to [the university hospital]… . You know, these things don't happen that often, but from what I understand it, it's pretty clear. Even if mom is very sick, you know, potentially life threatening, can't do anything.  &gt;In residency, Dr P and Dr H had been taught to perform uterine evacuation or labor induction on patients during inevitable miscarriage whether fetal heart tones were present or not. In their new Catholic-owned hospital environment, such treatment was considered a prohibited abortion by the governing ethics committee because the fetus is still alive and the patient is not yet experiencing “a life-threatening pathology” such as sepsis. Physicians such as Dr H found that in some cases, transporting the patient to another hospital for dilation and curettage (D&amp;C) was quicker and safer than waiting for the fetal heartbeat to stop while trying to stave off infection and excessive blood loss. Dr B, an obstetrician–gynecologist working in an academic medical center, described how a Catholic-owned hospital in her western urban area asked her to accept a patient who was already septic. When she received the request, she recommended that the physician from the Catholic-owned hospital perform a uterine aspiration there and not further risk the health of the woman by delaying her care with the transport.  &gt;&gt;    Because the fetus was still alive, they wouldn't intervene. And she was hemorrhaging, and they called me and wanted to transport her, and I said, “It sounds like she's unstable, and it sounds like you need to take care of her there.” And I was on a recorded line, I reported them as an EMTALA [Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act] violation. And the physician [said], “This isn't something that we can take care of.” And I [said], “Well, if I don't accept her, what are you going to do with her?” [He answered], “We'll put her on a floor [i.e., admit her to a bed in the hospital instead of keeping her in the emergency room]; we'll transfuse her as much as we can, and we'll just wait till the fetus dies.”  &gt;Ultimately, Dr B chose to accept the patient to spare her unnecessary suffering and harm, but she saw this case as a form of “patient dumping,” because the patient was denied treatment and transported while unstable.  snip  &gt;Some doctors have decided to take matters into their own hands. In the following case, the refusal of the hospital ethics committee to approve uterine evacuation not only caused significant harm to the patient but compelled a perinatologist, Dr S, now practicing in a nonsectarian academic medical center, to violate protocol and resign from his position in an urban northeastern Catholic-owned hospital.  &gt;    I'll never forget this; it was awful—I had one of my partners accept this patient at 19 weeks. The pregnancy was in the vagina. It was over… . And so he takes this patient and transferred her to [our] tertiary medical center, which I was just livid about, and, you know, “we're going to save the pregnancy.” So of course, I'm on call when she gets septic, and she's septic to the point that I'm pushing pressors on labor and delivery trying to keep her blood pressure up, and I have her on a cooling blanket because she's 106 degrees. And I needed to get everything out. And so I put the ultrasound machine on and there was still a heartbeat, and [the ethics committee] wouldn't let me because there was still a heartbeat. This woman is dying before our eyes. I went in to examine her, and I was able to find the umbilical cord through the membranes and just snapped the umbilical cord and so that I could put the ultrasound—“Oh look. No heartbeat. Let's go.” She was so sick she was in the [intensive care unit] for about 10 days and very nearly died… . She was in DIC [disseminated intravascular coagulopathy]… . Her bleeding was so bad that the sclera, the white of her eyes, were red, filled with blood… . And I said, “I just can't do this. I can't put myself behind this. This is not worth it to me.” That's why I left",20744,607917,0,0,1,1,©

t5_2sokd,ninoffmaniak,1330212397,"&gt;n other words he is flying so fast, he keeps missing the ground.  This is an excerpt from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.   How To Fly  © by Douglas Adams  There is an art, it says, or rather, a knack to flying. The knack lies in learning how to throw yourself at the ground and miss. Pick a nice day, [The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy] suggests, and try it.    The first part is easy. All it requires is simply the ability to throw yourself forward with all your weight, and the willingness not to mind that it's going to hurt.    That is, it's going to hurt if you fail to miss the ground. Most people fail to miss the ground, and if they are really trying properly, the likelihood is that they will fail to miss it fairly hard.    Clearly, it is the second part, the missing, which presents the difficulties.    One problem is that you have to miss the ground accidentally. It's no good deliberately intending to miss the ground because you won't. You have to have your attention suddenly distracted by something else when you're halfway there, so that you are no longer thinking about falling, or about the ground, or about how much it's going to hurt if you fail to miss it.    It is notoriously difficult to prize your attention away from these three things during the split second you have at your disposal. Hence most people's failure, and their eventual disillusionment with this exhilarating and spectacular sport.    If, however, you are lucky enough to have your attention momentarily distracted at the crucial moment by, say, a gorgeous pair of legs (tentacles, pseudopodia, according to phyllum and/or personal inclination) or a bomb going off in your vicinty, or by suddenly spotting an extremely rare species of beetle crawling along a nearby twig, then in your astonishment you will miss the ground completely and remain bobbing just a few inches above it in what might seem to be a slightly foolish manner.    This is a moment for superb and delicate concentration. Bob and float, float and bob. Ignore all consideration of your own weight simply let yourself waft higher. Do not listen to what anybody says to you at this point because they are unlikely to say anything helpful. They are most likely to say something along the lines of ""Good God, you can't possibly be flying!"" It is vitally important not to believe them or they will suddenly be right.    Waft higher and higher. Try a few swoops, gentle ones at first, then drift above the treetops breathing regularly.    DO NOT WAVE AT ANYBODY.    When you have done this a few times you will find the moment of distraction rapidly easier and easier to achieve.    You will then learn all sorts of things about how to control your flight, your speed, your maneuverability, and the trick usually lies in not thinking too hard about whatever you want to do, but just allowing it to happen as if it were going to anyway.    You will also learn about how to land properly, which is something you will almost certainly screw up, and screw up badly, on your first attempt.    There are private clubs you can join which help you achieve the all-important moment of distraction. They hire people with surprising bodies or opinions to leap out from behind bushes and exhibit and/or explain them at the critical moments. Few genuine hitchhikers will be able to afford to join these clubs, but some may be able to get temporary employment at them.",4450,2108,0,0,1,1,©

This entire post is complete nonsense and contains no actual content whatsoever.  &gt;To clarify, I want so badly to be wrong. But as an owner of 3 businesses myself. I must say that if money is a driving force.  Welcome to nearly every video game ever?  Besides some indie games and a handful of retail games, making money is the reason why games are made.  &gt;They are playing it perfectly by the book.  Delaying the game to completely redo the skills system several times in order to make it better is ""playing it by the book""?  No, playing it by the book would have been to release D2 again with some small improvements.  Is that what you wanted?  It sort of seems like it.  &gt;They are milking WoW as long as possible.  I think you may be confusing ""milking"" with ""supporting"".  People want to play WoW, so Blizzard continues to release content.  You're acting like there's something malicious going on here.  I'm assuming you're trying to complain about the pet store based on something you posted later in this post, but here's some interesting information: that pet that you linked was the first one added to the store in the course of five months.  If Blizzard was bombarding players with collectible in-game shit that costs real money, I could agree that they are milking the game a bit, but they would have to be doing something like releasing new things *at least* monthly.  &gt;Because D3 will not make as much money and the consumer base heavily overlaps.  Do you have a source for that?  &gt;It's tremendously boring and overly simplistic. Every sacrifice has been made to cater this game to larger and larger markets. Blizzard has abandoned the mantra of producing the best games, for producing the biggest piles of cash.  How so?  Such as?  Examples?  &gt;Hoping that all this console crap and the D3 beta was a joke and the real game no one has seen.  ........  &gt;In Summary, I fully expect them to release a version for the iPad, It's that bad.   Because games that aren't only on the PC are inherently bad.  &gt;EDIT: This post angered a lot of fan boys.  No it didn't, you have one reply and quite a few upvotes.  What are you talking about?  &gt;Doesn't matter how much more HP they give monsters in later levels you only have 4-6 buttons.  You only had two in Diablo 2.  &gt;They have recently removed more complexity. Runewords gone and skill tree choices.  Man, where to start...  First of all, complexity itself is not interesting when you don't have many choices.  Yeah, there were a lot of skills, but not choosing a cookie-cutter optimal build was gimping yourself, as the game seemed to be balanced around optimal builds, or at least having ridiculous enough gear to carry your weird-ass build through hell.  For my Blizzard sorceress, my build required putting a point into Warmth, a couple more to get Teleport, and then just maxing out Cold Mastery, Blizzard, and its synergies.  Complex?  Yea, talents receive bonuses for having points in somewhat unrelated talents, making your character extremely powerful if you have a well thought-out spec.  Fun?  I'd say no.  There were no choices, unless you wanted to get a weak version of some random spell while also weakening your main ability.  That's just the Blizzard Sorc build, but most of them were pretty similar to that from what I remember.  An Orb Sorc did the same thing as a Blizzard Sorc, but you maxed out Frozen Orb which only had one synergy.  Your leftover points were mostly spent in Blizzard, since that would do much more damage than spells from other trees would since you maxed Cold Mastery and are likely wearing +%cold skill damage gear.  There was also ""meteorb"" type builds to get around immunities, but those weren't entirely necessary at higher gear levels.  I mainly played Paladins though, and their choices were even less so than Sorceresses.  For a Zeal Pally, you maxed out Zeal, Sacrifice (a Zeal synergy), Fanaticism, and Holy Shield (since there was nothing else to use them on).  Your other skill points?  They literally didn't matter.  You would never use them.  Your left click is bound to Zeal, and your right click to Fanaticism.  Changing either is bad in pretty much every circumstance, unless you are buffing yourself with Holy Shield.  Smiters had it worse, you only maxed Smite, Holy Shield, and Fanaticism.  As characters generally reached level 80 at least, you had 20+ worthless points.  Well, you could spend them on the Resist auras for a bit of passive max resistance, but that's it.  What I'm trying to get at is that the skill trees didn't really offer you choices.  You picked the skill you wanted to base your build around, you maxed it out, you maxed out the synergies, or else your character was pathetic.  It wasn't very fun.  The skill system in Diablo 3, however, is fun.  You get 6 skills at a time from a choice of around 25-30 total, as well as 3 passive skills, of which there are 15.  Every skill is useful in some way, so you actually have to make some tough choices with every build.  In addition to that, every skill has 6 runes that modify it in a usually pretty significant way.  I don't know about you, but to me that sounds far and away more interesting than having one or two main skills and the rest of your choices going straight to slightly increasing the damage of those skills.  And Runewords... if you had actually played the beta, you would know that crafting operates in almost the same fashion.  You acquire materials, through either salvaging random magic items or trading, then you craft them into an item with some variable predetermined stats as well as some random effects.  The way Runewords worked is you acquired materials, through either finding them or trading, then you put them together into an item with some variable predetermined stats.  Having the crafted items always contain some random effects makes each item unique, something that the Runeword system completely failed at.  Personally I am looking forward to seeing people wear gear besides Enigma and Fortitude.  Also, what do you mean ""removed recently?""  Runewords were never in the game, and skill trees were removed a while ago.  I don't think you've actually played the beta.  &gt;FYI - I tried to get people to cancel all their WoW Account last march so that they would be forced to release the game before the console edit.  .............what.  How in the world did you get the idea that Blizzard would rush out an unfinished game a year ahead of schedule because some other game of theirs that was most likely expected to lose some subscribers lost some subscribers?  &gt;Q1 Earning report look really BAD last ditch effort to boost investor confidence. Expect early to Mid-March.  Yea, that isn't going to happen.  In the Q4 conference we learned that [2011 was the one of the most successful years ever for Activision Blizzard](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1pNf_AimQQ).  The chances of everything suddenly going to shit three months later is basically nil.  D3 is already planned for a May/June launch anyway.  &gt;However if people are still buying WoW pandas and World of Warcraft® Pet: Guardian Cub!!! They will delay the release until revenues decrease and stock price goes down.  The panda pet is more than a year old, I don't think many people are buying it still.  And the pet you linked is almost 4 months old.  Delaying the game further is unlikely, as Blizzard is planning on having 3 big releases this year, IIRC.  D3 is expected in Q2, the WoW expansion in Q3, and the Starcraft expansion in Q4.  Or maybe WoW and SC switched, I don't remember.  Delaying one game means some releases will overlap, which means there will likely be potential consumers of both products who are forced into purchasing only one or the other.  I think you are the guy who said Blizzard games share their customer base, so you would know about how that wouldn't be a good thing.  &gt;--- Currently no Incentive to release D3 --- https://www.google.com/finance?client=ob&amp;q=NASDAQ:ATVI  I don't know enough about stocks to understand what you're getting at here.  &gt;http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2012/02/25/why-im-still-long-activision-blizzard.aspx  This article is terrible.  It claims that work has recently been started on the real money auction house, when it has in fact been finished for a few months.

You could figure out those things through Google.  This guy doesn't really seem to be worth listening to.

This laptop is going to cost what? $1700+? Yet even on BF3 which is already out the NVIDIA® GeForce® GT 555M 2GB DDR5 can only play it on medium (above 30FPS).  low:   49.2  fps   med.: 32.3  fps  high:  24.5  fps  ultra:  9.8  fps  For that price you could build an epic high end machine or even like 3 middle range desktop systems. You could make 3 middle range systems for $500 a pop then sell them for more then you made them.  Plus the inability to upgrade this means even if you can play things now it will be out of date an useless within a short period of time. ,35956,6555,0,0,1,1,®

t5_2qh03,nosut,1330305584,"&gt;It's more like $2,800.  In which case you could build a monster machine or what 4-6 mid range machines that you could sell at profit?  &gt;And yes, there is such a thing as a gaming laptop. I'm using one at this very moment.  No there is not. You are using an overpriced laptop that you happen to game on. Just because it has a ""dedicated"" GPU its still a mobile GPU which is utter crap.  &gt;Can easily play BF3 on a mix of med and high at around 45FPS and plays everything else just fine on high+. Only cost me $1,400.   I spent like $600 less almost 2 years ago on my build at it can max out BF3 with 60+ FPS so I have no idea why you are proud of getting ripped off.  &gt;May not be able to upgrade it, but it has been of more use than my desktop has since I can carry it everywhere.  In which case you will have to purchase an entirely new laptop in a year or so because yours can not play any newer games. The big draw for PC gaming? The graphics. If you cant beat a console with the computer then you lose one of the main reasons for the computer.  Also just because you can carry it anywhere does not mean much. I had a laptop that I could play old games. I took the thing everywhere. Problem is just because you bring it somewhere does not make it good for gaming. Another big draw of the PC keyboard and mouse. I laptop does not have a full keyboard or an actual mouse. Yes you can get USB for both but that means its not so portable. You have to get the space and actually set it up. You lose a lot of the reason the laptop is good.  &gt;And the notion that computers become out of date and useless in a short period of time is heavily overused and false. Yeah, we have big jumps in graphics every couple of years, but devs are staying with lower spec requirements lately because it leads to more sales.  GIANT flaw with your argument as I stated before the CURRENT mobile GPU ""NVIDIA® GeForce® GT 555M 2GB DDR5"" can hardly play BF3(which was released months ago). That means that the lower spec requirements you are talking about devs matching with are already closing in on those mobile GPUs. Within a year they will be the minimum if not damn close to it.   So yes you are right that they ight not go out of date so quickly but you need to remember a few things.  1. Devs are matching current DESKTOP GPUs NOT laptop GPUs which are far worse.   2. If the newest laptop GPUs can only play a game that is already 4 months old on medium then what about in another 4-8 months? New games might only run on low if at all.",35956,6555,0,0,1,1,®

t5_2qzb6,iampaulanthony,1330403632,"Interesting perspective.  In general, I personally believe that copyright terms are too long as is.  They're meant to compensate authors and creators in order to further their creation of more work which provides more cultural input to their communities.  © wasn't originally designed to run on for generations and compensate authors surviving families.  It doesn't encourage the creation of new works, rather the opposite...only protecting older works.  Not enough balance there.  Creators should be encouraged to create, not the opposite.

t5_2qlit,Roark,1330404087,"Agree with almost everything, just an insignificant bone to pick.  Terminology is important... 'pronation' is not at all a bad thing. In fact, it's the main biomechanical process by which we can attenuate shock upon impact. An inward rotation of the foot allows the impact forces to be borne by the arch, stored through windlass in the plantar fascia, and returned upon propulsion. Pronation is a good thing, and we do not wish to prevent it. 'Overpronation' is the collapse you are describing, and Vibram themselves agrees with your take. From their site:  &gt;For some over-pronators (people whose feet tend to flatten during full weight-bearing exercise), Vibram FiveFingers® footwear will be too much of an abrupt change in biomechanics. We always recommend what we call a micro progression into Vibram FiveFingers. The too-much-too-soon phenomenon can be a problem for anyone's foot. In the case of severe over-pronators, Vibram FiveFingers might not be a wise choice for weight-bearing activities. Over-pronators will definitely benefit from some focused rehabilitation and foot-specific exercises before wearing any minimalist footwear.  Like you said:  &gt;I know that small amounts of barefoot running on grass at the end of my runs has helped increase foot strength and improved form.  In the industry, we want everyone to experience this. Proprioception is vital to healthy, successful runners; you can't mitigate impact without a feel for the ground. I love that minimalism, and Vibram (fads notwithstanding), have brought the focus back to this. But for God's sake, people, *MODERATION*..",8532,4036,0,0,1,1,®

Having said that, and before I say any more, I'd like to say that I actually do respect you for what you do, and all the time you've put into your site. Deep down, I'd love to see the site become a 1st-class site (on the order of StackOverflow, etc.). However, under the current guise and considering the PHP community's status quo, I don't think that will be possible.  Example: an ill-informed co-worker linked to your site yesterday (which was actually the first time your site has ever been linked at work in over 4 years), and here are some of the reactions:  &gt; I did the dirty work… had to go through 10 different screens before getting an account registered (what the?) – using a GMAIL account that I never used.  I hate registering for a site and getting dumb SPAMS.  And...  &gt; Wow, I didn’t know anyone still used that site… let me find a login and download the code…  **Regardless of whether it's the author's choice or not, we hate registering just to see code**. Ultimately, this presents itself as a problem with _your_ site, not with the author's choice; in other words, **you** are responsible for forcing us to register to download the code since **you** created the site feature that supports that. Nothing is more frustrating than having a lead on something (a Google hit, a link from a co-worker, etc.) and then being stonewalled by the registration screen.  I know it's part of your design, but that design died with web 1.0. Nobody wants to register, and posted code should be open-source and easily accessible. For reference, the code that my co-worker linked to was © some random dude, but it didn't matter in the end as the code was crap anyways (waste of time to register and download....), and the site is generally....still, even after UI updates....stuck in the 90's.

t5_2qpol,GodOfAtheism,1330450232,"/u/willywonka159  The Weekly Sagan  16 February 2012  Silicon Valley Christian (Finally) Arrested  SAN FRANCISO - In an event that has been sweeping the country – mostly San Francisco, but the whole nation, really – user Frankfusion has finally been arrested and charged for involuntary offending. This all started last Thursday when user, and devout logical atheist, VeryMacabre called 911 to report an “offensive and totally ignorant” ichthux that was placed on Frankfusion’s car and on a shelf in their 2 bedroom apartment in the Silicon Valley.  The two users share an apartment in Cupertino as they are both trying to get into the notable Apple Inc. company. On Thursday, after a long hard day of work at the local Starbucks, VeryMacabre found that Frankfusion has installed an ichthux, a fish-resembling symbol used to denote an ignorant Christian, on the back of his 1993 Honda Civic. “At first, I really wasn’t that mad, because I knew that my periodic table of elements bumper sticker on my 2011 Toyota Prius was better looking, and based on fact, but when I walked into our apartment and saw that he had put up the same little fish on our picture shelf, I just couldn’t take it,” VeryMacabre told the Weekly Sagan. Macabre immediately called 911 to report the issue and in minutes the police had arrived at the small, suburban apartment.  Frankfusion defended his case to the police by stating that “the ichthux was on my side of the shelf, in fact, it was in my room, I don’t even know why Macabre was in there in the first place.”  “I had to get your scissors to work on my art project” VeryMacabre retorted. The issue for the officers was that there was no evidence of deliberate offending and the police had to return to the station without an arrest, though without taking a full report of the incident and statements of the two individuals involved.  After a week of VeryMacabre’s argument in front of the City Council, the council ruled in favor of a new law that states that “involuntary offending is, indeed, a crime.” The police have arrested Frankfusion at his local church, but as Mr. fusion stated as he was being led to the police car “Wow, I don’t even… I don’t even know what the problem is…”  The Weekly Sagan will keep its readers updated as the story progresses.  A New Study Finds That Over 99% of Politicians Lie to Us  In a new study conducted by Harvard Law School, it has now been found that over 99% of all politicians currently in public office have lied to their constituents or to the media at one point of their elected positions. The study finds that even though both Democratic and Republican politicians have lied at the same rate, Republicans are still worse because they are “hypocrites with no moral compass for the poor and working class of the country”. Out of the hundreds of politicians, both in the Executive and the Legislative Branch interviewed, only one was deemed “a truth-teller”. That politician was the Congressmen from Texas (R) Ron Paul. When reached out for a statement, Congressman Paul told the Weekly Sagan, “I just follow the Constitution and the Founding Father in my dreams, and the truth just comes out. I really don’t try to tell the truth, it just happens naturally.”  It is important to note that, even though President Obama has, according to this study, technically lied to the people of the United States, The Weekly Sagan has endorsed him for his “relentless fight to make sure those slimy, greedy bastards at Walmart and Bank of America pay their fair-fucking-share.”  The Logic Tribune, The Bravery Report, and the New York Times contributed to this report.

t5_2qhos,personjones,1330469539,"I said it was an old idea, but I never said it wasn't worthwhile understanding - the reason you're being asked to look at this stuff is because it's fundamental to the field, and vital that you understand it to make sense of most more recent (and complex) ideas in the field. Yes, it's easier to come up with new ideas at the cutting edge, but you need to understand older ideas to reach it (and it's not the case that you can't never say original things about old ideas, but understanding them is more important anyway). You may think this stuff is obvious and not worth your time, but it seems that you're not entirely clear on many of the basic theoretical concepts being used here. Quite a lot of this area of linguistics, especially the philosophical side, is about thinking clearly about seemingly obvious things. This is why you need to start with original research and textbooks before tackling recent research, and this includes Iten and Recanati.  One other problem is that you seem very keen to read articles and so on, but you don't seem to be thinking about these issues for yourself in very much depth, and that's why things seem hazy - it's not enough just to read these ideas, you have to *study* them too.  Let's go back to the start and define what exactly truth conditions are - some of this may seem basic, and has probably been covered in your lectures, but bear with me. This approach has it's origin in Tarski's convention T (used for formal logic), which was applied to natural language by Davidson in 1967. The idea is that we can describe the meaning of a proposition in terms of the conditions that hold when it is true, for instance, we could say:  (1) ""Snow is white,"" if and only if snow is white.  Now, this looks like a tautology, but this is because our language of investigation (termed the object language) is the same as the language we're using to analyse it (termed the meta-language) - they're both English. So it perhaps makes more sense if we change the object language to something else like, say, German, while keeping the metalanguage the same:  (2) ""Der Schnee ist weiß,"" if and only if snow is white.  So now it's not longer a tautology - we're essentially saying that the German propostion ""Der Schnee ist weiß"" is a true statement only in worlds where the snow is white, and thus we've defined the conditions under which ""Der Schnee ist weiß"" is true, which we call its truth conditions.  And that's all there is to truth conditions - under this simple approach to meaning, someone who knows the meaning of a proposition is someone who knows the truth conditions under which it holds, and so is able to say whether a specific proposition is true or false in a given world. Thus we say that meaning is a function from possible worlds to truth values - i.e. it's something that, given a proposition, takes a possible world and spits out ""true,"" or ""false."" You may think this is a slightly odd way to think about meaning in any sense, and you might have a point - this is one potential problem you could investigate to criticise the truth-conditional approach. But as discussed above, even when we take truth conditions to be part of meaning, it's long been recognised that it's not the be all and end all of meaning, and the subject of pragmatics (starting with Grice) looks at meaning in a much broader sense.  You implied above that truth conditions should be represented in some kind of formal logic, and this is indeed a reasonable approach to truth-conditional semantics, because it gives us a very clear way of explaining complex propositions in terms of simpler ones, and the whole system can be set up to cope with truth values, which are the bread and butter of truth-conditional semantics. Let's consider (1) from my earlier post, repeated here as (3):  (3) I really like John, and he's very sensible.  One simple way of analysing this is to split it into two separate propositions - ""I really like John,"" which I'll call *j*, and ""he's very sensible,"" which I'll call *s*. So we can express this is normal propositional calculus as follows:  (4) j ∧ s  So we're saying that the propositions *j* and *s* are joined with a connective (more complex analysis is of course possible, but here I'm treating *j* and *s* as ""basic"" or atomic propositions). I can see you've come across this kind of approach before, and this may (all) seem basic, but it might help you to think about what exactly ∧ is. You've probably seen it's semantics described in terms of a truth table, but we can also think of it as a function that takes two truth values, and outputs one, with the definition of the function all being set up to coincide with the truth table (i.e. outputting true only when the two inputs are true, and false otherwise). Now, crucially, *this is all ∧ is*. We haven't defined it in any other way in our system, so this is its meaning - something that takes the truth values of two propositions and gives you another meaning according to the inputs. As I'm sure you know, we can define other connectives similarly, such as ∨, →, and ↔, by changing the truth table (or the defintion of the function, if you prefer to think of it in that way).  Now, you already know that things like *but* pose a problem here, but you've proposed a possible solution - as I understand it, you're suggesting that we should define another logical connective that we can give the meaning of *but*. I suggest you try doing this - draw up the truth table that you would give *but* (which, if you recall from above, fully defines its meaning), and then compare it to the truth tables for your other logical connectives. Once you've done that, have a think about whether or not your approach works, then go back and look at (1-6) in my previous post and see if you can analyse them all using this kind of approach - remember, if you give any two propostions the same representation, then you're saying they have the same truth conditions, and if you're saying truth conditions are the same as meaning, then you're also saying they have the same meaning. If you do this correctly, you'll run into problems, and the problems you run into should help demonstrate what exactly truth conditions are, and how there can be non-truth-conditional aspects to meaning.  Then go and read Grice, or an introduction to Gricean pragmatics (crucially, not a recent paper, which will take these basic issues for granted). I think you're underestimating just how important the Gricean approach is in the study of pragmatics - in fact, some would say (along with neo-Gricean approaches) it practically *is* pragmatics. And Grice has specific analyses of cases such as *but* (they're analysed as instances of conventional implicature, a term you should come across in your reading of Grice), so implicatures are far more than just one possible exception to truth-conditional meaning.  If you want to progress in your understanding of this stuff, I suggest you take my advice and start by looking at the basics, however obvious they may seem, and thinking about them and their implications. Furthermore, have a go at the exercise I set, or at least try something comparable in a textbook. Recent research in this topic is indeed interesting, but will have to wait until you have a firm foundation to consider it from.",438,359,0,0,1,1,↔
t5_2qh3p,carys,1330470219,"&gt; There are a couple things either of us are into that the other isn't totally into themselves, but I'm willing to compromise to please him, and I wish he would try to do the same.

You mention in your response to Picea that you let him cum on your face because it's something HE wants, even though you're not ""into"" doing it.

Good fake out by Ganzi here! Hero's  not revealed what he's going for yet, but it's only one gas so far, so I'm expecting a fast expand. Hero gets a probe into Hero's base, seeing the fast expansion, Hero tosses down his expansion right away, and here we go :D Factory and a reactor going down for Ganzi, and hold on, Hero pushes in with three stalkers and a zealot, killing TWO MARAUDERS and all the marines! Ganzi is forced to pull EVERY SCV!!! HOLY FUCKING SHIT Hero's micro is INCREDIBLE! He dodged through the mass of SCV's, killing SIX of them, target firing marines INSIDE the mass of SCV's AND the hellions, and Hero has STILL NOT LOST ANY STALKERS!! Ganzi FINALLY finishes his bunker, but Hero's already killed 25 SCV's, he does get a banshee into the main of Hero, but there's no way that it can even the odds. THIRTY ONE WORKERS KILLED for Hero at 9:00, and Hero is just SO GOOD. Dear GOD. I don't think I used enough caps there &gt;&gt; But seriously. Wow. Hero's just so far ahead right now, I don't think there's any way he can lose.   Hero's just poking up the ramp of Ganzi, picking off units one by one, he's trading VERY inefficiently, but it doesn't matter 'cause he's just THAT far ahead, and Ganzi is just going to be annihilated here as the immortals begin arriving. There's the GG.  ###### GG Liquid_Hero!  ---  G2: Map - Entombed Valley --- ---  Ganzi's going to get a 12 rax, 13 gas, but he's not going to actually mine gas from it, using the extra money to throw down a ninja expansion across the map, and OH MY GOD! Ganzi's trying to get a DOUBLE expansion off of one barracks, but Hero's going for a 4 gate! There's not even a bunker down for Ganzi right now, and it looks like it's going to be an easy build order win for Hero. First round of stalkers warps in, Ganzi immediately attempts to start up a bunker, but it's going to die immediately, Hero gets a superfast win! He's SO happy he's literally crying in happiness! He's just overwhelmed, GO HERO! :D ♥  ###### GG Liquid_Hero! Going to Code S! ",71175,4369,0,0,1,1,♥

t5_2cneq,NashMcCabe,1330536160,"**delusion**  in psychology, a rigid system of beliefs with which a person is preoccupied and to which the person firmly holds, despite the logical absurdity of the beliefs and a lack of supporting evidence. Delusions are symptomatic of such mental disorders as paranoia, schizophrenia, and major depression and of such physiological conditions as senile psychosis and delirium. They vary in intensity, extent, and coherence and may represent pathological exaggeration of normal tendencies to rationalization, wishful thinking, and the like. Among the most common are delusions of persecution and grandeur; others include delusions of bodily functioning, guilt, love, and control    *""delusion."" © Encyclopedia Britannica, Inc..
