t5_2qh1o,ErrantWhimsy,1351728068,"Here is our official fact sheet about these two.    About Berani and Dumai   **Berani**  What is he? A Malayan tiger ( Panthera tigris jacksoni). Native to Penisular Malaysia. Only an estimated 500 remain in the wild. There are 55 Malayan tigers in Association of Zoos &amp; Aquariums accredited zoos in North America.  Name: Berani (pronounced Burr-ani) means “brave” in Malay; he was named by the veterinary staff at Tulsa Zoo.   Born:  Aug. 26 at Tulsa Zoo.  Birth weight:  Approximately 2.5 pounds  Current weight: 12 pounds, 15 ounces.  Parents:  Mother, Jin, 4; father Gahara, 7.   His litter: He was a single birth.   Why is he being hand-reared? He was not getting enough milk and his mother was inattentive, Tulsa Zoo veterinarians said.   Why is he coming to Point Defiance Zoo &amp; Aquarium? It’s best for hand-reared tigers to be raised together. They’ll acquire tiger behaviors from one another and learn to socialize and  behave in an appropriate way with humans and other tigers in zoo-based populations.  How different are Malayan tiger Berani and Sumatran tiger Dumai?   Malayan tigers are a bit bigger, lighter in color and lankier in body formation. They are native to the tropical forests of Peninsular Malaysia. The Tiger Conservation Campaign estimates that fewer than 500 remain in the wild.  ·         Sumatran tigers are the smallest subspecies of tiger. Their fur is a darker orange than that of Malayans. They are also the only remaining tiger subspecies that lives on an island.  They are critically endangered, and as few as 300 live in the wild.   **Dumai**  What is he? A Sumatran tiger (Panthera tigris sumatrae). Native to the Indonesian island of Sumatra. There are 74 Sumatran tigers in Association of Zoos &amp; Aquariums accredited zoos in North America and about 375 as part of the Global Species Management Plan. Only an estimated 300 remain in the wild.  Name: Dumai (pronounced doo-my). Dumai is a city in the Sumatran province of Riau. Members of the public picked Dumai in an online survey of six names submitted by members of the Asian Forest Sanctuary staff who care for the cub.  Born:  Aug. 22 at Point Defiance Zoo &amp; Aquarium.    Birth weight:  Approximately 3 pounds.  Current weight: 14.2 pounds – a 425 percent gain since birth.  Parents:  Mother, Jaya, 9; father, Malosi, 4.  His litter: He was a single birth.   Why is he being hand-reared? Zoological staff and veterinarians decided to separate him from his mother when it was clear that intervention was crucial for his health. Within days of his birth, he was not getting enough milk, was dehydrated and his temperature was low. He is now thriving.   **General questions about the tigers**  *Is it rare for two subspecies to be reared together?* Yes. It’s not common, but it does occasionally happen.   *What do they eat?* Each of the cubs is fed a special formula designed to give him the nutrients he needs to thrive and grow. Their teeth are coming in, and they also are beginning to eat a type of ground meat.  *How long will they be hand-reared?*  It depends on the tigers’ growth and the zoological staff. Zookeepers will know when the tigers are big enough to thrive without round-the-clock attention. That likely will be when they are 4 to 6 months old and weigh around 100 pounds.  *How long will they live in the Cub Den?*  Until they outgrow it. Then, they’ll be shifted to the Day Room in the Asian Forest Sanctuary.  *How big will they get?* Each may reach 275-300 pounds when fully grown.  *Will Dumai return to Jaya or Berani to his mother at Tulsa Zoo?* No. The two cubs will remain together as “brothers” as they are cared for and shifted onto exhibit at Point Defiance Zoo &amp; Aquarium.  *How long will they stay at Point Defiance Zoo &amp; Aquarium?* That decision is up to Species Survival Plan® officials. Typically, they remain at their home zoos until they are sexually mature, which occurs at about age 3. Then, a decision is made about where to place them for breeding purposes to increase their numbers and maintain genetic diversity in the subspecies. Berani will eventually be mated with a Malayan tiger; Dumai with another Sumatran.   *Do other zoos have Malayan and Sumatran tigers:* Yes, but only two other zoos in the United States – Dallas Zoo and San Diego Zoo – have both.   *What are the threats to tigers in the wild?* Poaching and habitat loss due to human encroachment on their native lands.   *How can people learn more about the tigers?* Go to pdza.org for information on tiger conservation, awareness and fundraising efforts.",®

What does help is making sure I'm not dried out, and that I'm in good voice with a good, muscle relaxing warm up.  A good massage also helps open stuff up. Love a massage when my voice is feeling weird.",®

t5_2qm4e,n3cr0,1351836535,"Basically the principal is that water evaporates (transpiration) mainly from the leaves at the top of the tree and the water is pulled through the dead cells that form a type of ""tube"" system leading up the tree.  I don't know for sure what the internal cell structure of this tree system looks like, but based on gravity and how the cells are typically structured in trees, I'd say that its more probable that this is the case.  I suppose it would be possible for it to be plumbed backwards and the water would flow up the right tree and then down the connecting branch/tissue and then up the left ... but that seems very unlikely since these pathways are build from one root structure up the trunk of a tree.  edit:  I didn't address the question.  Overall I would say the tree on the right is better off because the typical limiting factor in a forest like the one pictured is water.  Overall having access to more water would allow the tree to support more leaves (in reality more leaves would be required to maintain a certain level of water transmition to the air to keep the water flowing up) and so would then absorb more sunlight allowing it to convert more energy to nutrients and on and on.  Basically the advantage of pulling extra water without the added time required adding the girth to the trunk would be a great leg up.  That being said, I'm going off a single picture, could be completely off ☺",☺

t5_2qh1i,emwo,1351846981,"Quite a few! One of my best friends irl is someone that I met online, but it was a complete accident.  One I can consider my closest friend, we've talked nearly daily for like 6 years though we live in different states. We've met like twice and he's freaking awesome and talented! It doesn't even feel like it was that long ago. We've supported each other and vented when we need to. :)  Another is a friend from like '04, ""Alex"", from Kazakhstan. We're not close, we don't know what each other look like but we talk whenever we're online. He refuses to use the internet for anything beside AIM /youtube anymore so it's always great to hear from him! He's aged so much, it's scary. He wants to be a history professor and goes on tangents a bout middle eastern history; pretty neat stuff. I don't remember where we met.   There's a clique of friends in michigan that I still talk to regularly, I think I met one through 4chan because he and his friend (on gaia) were trolling me on the forums. Not sure how exactly we all got acquainted but it feels like I'm a part of their social circle. With one friend in particular that I was Skyping with... he was talking about proposing to her. She came online a few days later flipping out and showing me her ring. &lt;3 One of his friends comes online at random to have me tell him bedtime stories too. &gt;.&gt;   2 from 4chan: somebody posted my address on 4chan with all my details including screen names so I got messages on AIM / ICQ with trolls. 2 in particular were warning me and helping me out while I was flipping out. They're never online anymore but I get texts occasionally when they have phone service.  There's also a group of my friend, my ex, and my friends ex. We'd game together, we'd skype together, we'd raid together, and just chill and talk. We were all pretty close for a few years. I talk to them individually once in a blue moon now, they both hate my ex, my friend just had his first baby, and the other chick and I text. They play LoL occasionally, though I can never join anymore.   Most recent ones have been  homies from g+ ♥♥ though i've been so caught up in school that i feel like a butthole for never joining hangouts anymore. We all met last year irl from around the world and they're rad people :( I miss them!",♥

t5_2qh96,Girlwithnousername,1351897328,"Sorry for the length of this reply, I’ve been going to gigs for a very long time.  1. Be prepared for talkers. You get people who want to chat to their mates at almost every gig. Either accept it, or try to stand halfway up on the sides or nearer the front to avoid them. The majority of talkers are usually late arrivals and generally stand towards the back (very generally, they do infiltrate crowds everywhere!). Don't be afraid people to ask people to very politely be quiet if it's a really special song for you, say, played at a really low volume or acoustic. You'll usually get a glare or maybe a 'how rude' reply, but most people do then quieten down if asked politely enough.   2. People will push in front of you to get to their friends with drinks, or just to get in front of you... You just have to sort of deal with it really. You probably should move to accommodate them unless you want beer spilt over you! It’s not a big thing though and you soon get used to it.  3. If you stand very close to the front you could get crushed/in a mosh pit/have people crowdsurfing over your head. This depends on the bands really, but I've seen people moshing at the front of middle-of-the-road indie bands who are playing songs that you’d think are impossible to mosh to (quite funny in hindsite).   4. Drinks (including water) at gig venues are usually twice what you'd pay in your local bar and the toilets, more often than not, are grotty and/or run out of toilet roll very quickly.  Or maybe this is just a UK thing.  5. There are good and bad places to stand at most gig venues. This can depend on many things: having a pillar in your way, the slope of the floor (or lack of slope, meaning everyone’s on the same level including really tall people), where the band come on stage, whether you’re on a path to the bar or the toilets or the exit. Don’t be afraid to experiment during the gig and move through the crowd to find the right place for you.  6. Exactly the same applies with sound. You can have a venue who have an excellent sound system in place, but if the band bring mediocre kit or if the soundman on the night isn’t very good, the sound can end up being below-par. So just find a place where the sound is good for you (but bear in mind that sound can change drastically between support and main acts due to differences in music genre and/or having their own different/better/louder kit – so good sound could suddenly become ear-popping).  7. The ‘doors’ time is often far off actual stage times. If you’re not at all bothered then just turn up for doors time stated. But if you’d rather not hang around waiting, call the venue and ask them what time the bands are on stage.  Here’s what I find in most venues: ‘doors’ state 7.30pm. The first support act actually comes on stage at 8pm. They’re done by around 8.30pm. It takes half an hour for a kit change and the main act is on stage at 9pm. Don’t take this as read (or is it red? I can never remember) though - it varies between venues.   8. If you are female, carry a handbag with as little as possible in it. You’ll be amazed at how heavy the most seemingly light handbag becomes after carrying it on one shoulder for four hours. Keep the bag close to you/take a bag that’s not easy for someone to get their hands inside. Also, wear sensible shoes.   9. I don’t know what applies outside the UK but here you can’t take your own drinks in, even water. You’ll be made to throw it away before entering the venue.   10. You can often find some pretty cool merchandise and beautifully hand-made cds at live gigs. Check out the merch table. Be prepared to pay a bit more than you’d usually expect to though. Merch sales are a really great way to further support smaller bands so I always check out the merch table and have come away with some absolutely beautiful items (there’s a lot of trash out there too though).  11. If you’re going to a huge venue, don’t be afraid to leave before the last song if you want to guarantee not having to queue for ages for the tube/bus/local train home. Most transport systems are efficient enough to handle the flow, but if you live pretty far out/are at risk of missing your connection, you do not HAVE to stay until the end!   12. Bearing the above in mind, if you do want to see every single song played, most bands do encores. Some even do two or three (I once saw one with four, which was absurd). The gig is not over until the lights come on, so don’t be mistaken into thinking that it’s over when they go off stage and many people start to leave. It’s ALWAYS when the lights come on!  13.  Use earplugs.  14. DON’T FORGET TO TAKE YOUR TICKET!  15.  Gigs are not a place to be self-conscience. Dance however you like and in whatever manner that best suits you; nobody around you will be paying the blindest bit of notice. But  - do dance. I believe it’s the law ☺  16. Enjoy. I hope you have a wonderful time and that you soon become a gig addict. ",☺

Family can't tell us a thing about her except that she's diabetic.  This registers little with me at the time.  As I'm putting an IV in her (complete with arm-bar, since she's so restless), she grips my arm, stares me in the eyes, and in a rare moment of clarity, says, ""I'm *starving*!"" then immediately goes back to her rapid, deep breathing.

The L-Tyrosine is converted in the brain to dopamine, and caffeine also increases dopamine activity. Concerta (methylphenidate) works by inhibiting dopamine reuptake, so the overall rise in dopamine activity due to the synergy between the supplement and your medication is probably at fault for at least the stimulation, if not also the nausea.

The Nazi party didn't have hard boundaries, it was an idea, one shared by industrialists and financiers in the UK and America. Eugenics was implemented first in the US and arguably continues to this day if you look at the prison population. Fascism won and the situation could hardly have gone worse. We have been on the edge of nuclear war for a long time, and we have at least a few Russians to thank for it not happening. One incident involved three Russian subs off the coast of Cuba told that should all three commanders agree they could launch an attack. US boats started dropping depth charges and outside of radio they were under the orders that if they all agreed they could launch nukes. Two thought that war had started and wanted to launch, [Vasili Arkhipov](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasili_Arkhipov) said no. We have been that close an unknown number of times.  Remember what Germany did? They invaded about four countries before the war started, and the Jewish issue came at the end of the war and makes strange economic sense if it happened like we are lead to believe. What have America done? If we ignore the millions killed by direct US aggression and CIA backed coups, they are currently occupying Libya, Egypt, Iraq, Afghanistan, and are at low level clandestine war with Pakistan and Iran. Israel is an apartheid state. The UK is an accessory, whilst harbouring some of the more significant financial terrorists and money laundering systems. The middle east from being on a comparable level social progress to the west (health care, woman's rights, education, etc) was in large parts knocked back to the stone age. Africa has been a hideous mess when we think of past and present day South Africa. There has been all manner of genocidal events, and America's middle eastern war games seem to be heading south. Indonesia doesn't fare better.  In many ways the wars of the 20th century have yet to end because fascist authoritarian militantism still is here. And we see it at home with secret courts, corporate lobbying, failure to properly police high level crime including hacking, expenses, and now a pedophile ring that probably includes aristocracy if not royalty and high members of the church (previously ""isolated"" to Ireland, now Mainland UK). We are funding the coup in Syria, we give political support to Israel, we are probably the largest tax haven, and Cameron® is agitating for war with Iran.",®

It's on sale here: http://www.staples.com/Canon-PIXMA-MX892-All-in-One-Printer/product_477868  I would avoid getting a color laser unless you plan on getting a super high end one (HP CP400X series). That is about the only way for you to be able to get the cost per page down to around what the Canon would be at. With this machine you only have to replace what you use most. Unfortunately, inkjet machines use all the colors at the same time for most printing to keep the printhead clean.  Brother machines are nice, but they are having issues with the print-head pumps failing; usually the yellow on the printhead will get a clog.  With that said, their professional series printers come with 2-3 year warranties.  For example: http://www.staples.com/Brother-Refurbished-EMFC-J6710DW-Inkjet-All-in-One-Printer/product_470646  With brother your cost per page will be lower, but I would get the super high end one to cover failure of the print head.

The large throat and bore allow free movement of energy directly into the horn resulting in a warmer, more powerful sound well suited to all musical styles.

t5_2qi1h,ram1546,1351977571,"Libye : le consultat américain de Benghazi, succursale de la CIA ? terrorisme(979) - CIA(70) - Wall Street Journal(4) - Attaque de Benghazi(2)  02/11/2012 à 09h:38 Par Jeune Afrique         Un bâtiment du consulat américain de Benghazi (Libye), le 12 septembre 2012. © AFP Pris d’assaut par des éléments proches d’Al-Qaïda au Maghreb islamique (Aqmi), le 11 septembre dernier, le consulat de Benghazi abritait une mission secrète des services de renseignement américain (CIA), rapporte le Wall Street Journal, dans son édition du 2 novembre. Selon le Wall Street Journal, dans son édition du 2 novembre [Lien payant], le consulat de Benghazi qui avait été pris d’assaut par des éléments proches d’Al-Qaïda au Maghreb islamique (Aqmi), le 11 septembre dernier, n’abritait pas que des diplomates. Au contraire, d’après le quotidien, seuls sept des trente responsables américains évacués après l’attaque travaillaient pour le département d'État. Les autres auraient essentiellement été des membres des services de renseignement, la fameuse Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). L’assaut contre le consulat, le jour de la commémoration des dix ans des attentats du 11 Septembre 2002, s’était produit dans un climat international de manifestations antiaméricaines suite à la diffusion d’un film anti-islam sur la Toile. L’ambassadeur Christopher Stevens et trois autres personnes sont morts durant l’attaque, qui a provoqué une tempête politique aux États-Unis, en pleine campagne électorale pour la présidentielle du 6 novembre prochain. Discrétion Les républicains du candidat Mitt Romney reprochent en effet au président sortant Barack Obama de n’avoir pas su sécuriser de manière satisfaisante les installations diplomatiques américaines dans une ville particulièrement exposée aux actions violentes d’Aqmi. Mais si les effectifs de sécurité n’étaient pas pléthoriques, c’est peut-être surtout en vertu de la discrétion que souhaitait garder la mission diplomatique de Benghazi. De fait, le WSJ affirme que plus d'une vingtaine de membres de la CIA opéraient en secret dans un bâtiment annexe du consulat, où s'étaient retranchés des membres du personnel après une première attaque. Les deux agents de sécurité libyens tués le 11 septembre travaillaient d’ailleurs pour l’agence et non pour le département d’État. Communication Or ce seraient surtout des problèmes de communication entre la CIA et les diplomates américains qui pourraient expliquer les failles en matière de sécurité, explique le WSJ. Qui indique également que la mission secrète de la CIA avait été entamée peu après le début de la révolte anti-Kaddafi, en février 2011. Selon le journal, l’objectif était de lutter contre le terrorisme et de mettre la main sur les armes lourdes du régime.

t5_2qhu8,cinemashow,1352006886,"Correct...Sorta. The Hemispherical rules differ for IFR and VFR traffic. VFR traffic flies at even thousand altitudes +500 for Westerly headings. IFR traffic flies at the even thousand feet.( And the Odd thousand feet for easterly headings). Therefore the rules state that traffic should be separated by a vertical distance of 500 feet.   Also when in proximity of an uncontrolled airport, there may be four or five aircraft all in the same traffic pattern. The distances are very close. It can be stressful. There could be 2 a/c on the downwind leg separated by less than a mile one on base and one on final. And this is when everyone is following FAR/AIM uncontrolled airport procedure. Lotta cowboys out their making their own rules in a traffic pattern at an uncontrolled airport. Oh. I forgot to add to this scenario.  Ultralights are often doing their ultralight thing at non controlled airports. And nobody is required, by law anyway, to be using proper self announce intentions.    The biggest problem in a traffic pattern situation that would be seen by the FAA as a violation would be if two aircraft were on the active runway at the same time. That would be classified as a runway incursion. ie One aircraft had landed and was rolling and was at the far end of the runway, and one aircraft on final would just touch down.   Runway incursions have been a dominant feature in all of the FAA's safety briefings. Aircraft behavior on airport taxiways have been scrutinized and many rules are now in place over the past couple of years to prevent runaway incursions. The definition of a runway incursion has now included any two aircraft with any part of them on an active runway at the same time i.e. crossing over the departure hold short line while another aircraft is still on its landing rollout. Or one aircraft has not crossed over the hold short line while taxiing off the active rw while another ac is landing.    Fok! Please excuse my wayyyy toooo long reply. 😛",😛

t5_2qh1e,SomePostMan,1352196624,"Well, I'm late to the party here...  I wrote out a long explanation of how I think the trick is done last time I saw this posted in a dead \/r/frisson thread^[1](http://www.reddit.com/r/Frisson/comments/velha/pennteller_fool_us_926_this_magician_will_blow/c545da5?context=3), in case anyone is interested:  &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; *Edit: timestamps below were based on [[this version]](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAjLQAc_2-Q).*  `- - - - -`  My best (shitty) guess:  In replacement tricks like this, the special card is often pre-chosen.  1. The 7♦ was pre-chosen, just like he joked (""it's okay if I see the card... I've seen this trick before""). He palmed the 7♦ in on top of Deck #1 [2:38 ... his hands appear empty at least for a moment but the angle and cut is limiting], the one he opened and that Penn shuffled. (Note that he didn't ask Penn to pick a random card, but the one ""on the back"".)  2. He swapped decks when he took the pen out [2:49] (as Penn noticed). The ""cooler"" deck that he brought in was:   · a shuffled deck with the joker, premiums, and 7♦ taken out, facing up;   · with the bottom half of the deck (8♦ and up) slightly pushed out (~1/16"") to make that slot easy to access;   · snugly in the box, with the bottom open, in the wrapper, with the bottom of the wrapper open;   · with a bit of easy adhesive (e.g. post-it-note glue, which won't smear or dry but will stay put for a second);   · with one custom-made extra-large card (~1/8"" wider, ~3/8"" longer) on top of it all to conceal the fact that the deck's in a box, sealed, and the bottom's hanging out.   (Note the angle of the deck toward the camera to maximize this effect.)  3. He finds the split in the deck and slides the signed 7♦ *face-down* into the deck at that spot (you can see him sliding it in carefully), then closes the bottom of the box and the wrapper behind it [3:00] while misdirecting with the Penn-pen joke and the sway of his body and laughing. Note his right thumb &amp; co. lingering near the bottom of the deck for a few seconds longer (camera angle limiting again).  4. He places the whole thing (sealed box with custom card on top) into Penn's hand, with his hand on top of the custom card, and has Penn cover it before removing the custom card.   &amp;nbsp;   (Sidenote:   ""Would it be impressive if I pulled out your card?"" This is to incorporate this seemingly-superfluous card into the act, so it doesn't seem so suspicious.   ""That would be very impressive."" Penn's just playing along and being nice. That trick alone would require only a slight palming of the card, and no deck switch.)   &amp;nbsp;   He claims the custom card he removed was the joker (and he probably made it a joker on the face side to be safe, although the camera contrast is too high to see) (of course, the cooler deck-box-wrapper never had a joker to begin with).  • Voila: Penn's holding a resealed deck containing 52 factory-ordered cards with his in the correct spot, but turned around. Shawn has him inspect the outside but not open it: there are no slits. He tears off the seal from the top. (It appears that he left the bottom of the seal on the deck, but again there's a camera cut. That might have been important or not depending on how he messed with the bottom.) The rest is automatic and he's very careful to turn the 7♦ around by the tips of his fingers so no one can suspect he simply palmed it in at the last moment.",♦

I watched that so many times; I'm not sure how I missed the fact that he fanned out the cards to offer a whole range instead of just the top card... it's very hard to see from the angle, but it's there.  My next best guess is that he palmed in a stack of about fifteen 7♦ so the whole range of the fan was forced.  The card pretty much had to have been pre-chosen, so figuring out what he did in the beginning to force it was the hardest part, with the camera angles and cuts and everything. (It's also comforting to note that, if the card was actually random, he likely would have just asked Penn to pick the card himself out of the shuffled deck without taking it back, as that would have made the trick much more impressive in that situation.)",♦

I finally figured out how to use the symbols on the label maker and the first symbol was the handicapped one. So i made a label that stated ""Retard"" with a handicapped symbol on either side of the  word. I was pretty high and there hasn't been any orders for about 35 minutes, so i asked my co-worker in the kitchen with me if he dared me to put it in the next order that came. He said no, but i felt like in many ways, i already dared myself. Next order on the screen was a 10pc Chicken McNuggets. I slapped the sticker on the inside of the box over the ""Nugget"" part so on the inside it said ""10 piece Chicken Mc♿Retard♿"" About an hour later, a lady came in, and she was crying. I asked the cashier what the hell was goin on and he said ""i undo, this bitch is crying and holding a nugget box"" i thought to myself, ""who the fuck waits an hour to eat there nuggets?""  I talked to my manager later and it turned out her son had Downs Syndrome. I asked my manager if i was going to be fired and he said we'll have to talk to head office. They called head office and it turns out the person who was at the top of the chain at McDonalds Head office also funded a school for mentally challenged children. soooooo i was terminated. ",♿

I'm not saying those factors don't exist, but poverty is a more fundamental problem.

t5_2subc,PseudoVanilla,1352390201,"OBS: Det er aflyst!  Kære venner.   Vi er blevet enige om at aflyse arrangementet ""Vi Ryger Cannabis ♥"" på Rådhuspladsen d. 10 november. Vi har talt med politikere, musikere, djs og foredragsholdere. Desværre er der ikke nogen, som har haft mulighed for at stille op på lørdag eller ikke nok til at vi føler arrangementet bliver slagkraftigt nok. Jeg ved at nogen af jer havde glædet sig til at ryge på Rådhuspladsen, men uden taler og musik nok bliver det nogle lange kolde timer og tilfældige forbipasserende vil ikke blive synderligt imponerede af det syn vi udgør.   Vi holdt et møde for nogle uger siden i forbindelse med arrangementet, hvor vi inviterede folk på facebook til at komme og deltage i planlægningen af arrangementet. Der kom 3 flinke gutter, men det bare ikke nok til at vi kan skabe den energi der skal til.   Jeg håber der i fremtiden vil være større opbakning omkring fri hash arrangementer i København. Der er brug for hjælp til planlægning og afvikling men især også talere, artister og andre vigtige folk med kendskab til situationen ude i verden.   Smokenhagen har en bod ved messen i Prag denne weekend, hvor vi har 2 habile danskere med erfaring til at repræsentere os. Dernede er de i kontakt med organisationer som blandt andre ENCOD, som kan hjælpe os med at organisere de danske rygere bedre og sætte os ind i de juridiske aspekter af en legalisering. De har også kontakt til Jorge Cervantes, Nol van Schaik, Ben Dronkers, Arjan Rosskamp og mange andre vigtige folk som gerne vil til Danmark og tale. Så nu fokuserer vi på at skabe et bedre og større arrangement med internationale talere og forhåbentlig også danske.   Er ked af at skuffe nogen af jer, men kig forbi Lavendelstræde hvis I vil tale om hvorfor vi har truffet denne beslutning.   Tak til Jøden og Hefty og Phase 5, som ellers var friske.",♥

t5_2qhlc,LawyerCT,1352392640,"Good question and one we naturally get asked a lot. In terms of performance--and thatonedude1 &amp; you bring up below--DNT+ creates fewer page errors than Ghostery. We do a lot of testing and receive a ton of bug reports from our users about page errors, like this video isn't loading on ESPN or this comment box isn't working, and we make individual tweaks to prevent that from happening. However, I believe Ghostery currently has a slightly longer list of trackers they block than DNT+, although we're always working to expand that when we find new ones. DNT+ blocks tracking by default, whereas you have to manually turn that on in Ghostery.  Other than error rates, there's not a huge difference in what the products do. In terms of business model/philosophy, however, there's a pretty big difference. Ghostery is owned by Evidon, formerly called Better Advertising Inc. They make money when Ghostery users opt into GhostRank, which collects and sells to advertisers aggregate information about the sites you visit, the ads you see, the links you click, etc., in order to build ""better"" advertising. They clearly state this [on their website:](http://www.evidon.com/solutions/encompass) &gt; Evidon Encompass leverages a proprietary library of more than 1,100 tracking scripts, as well as the seven million-member, opt-in Ghostery® panel, which anonymously supplies tracking code data on over 26 million websites.   Contrast their business model with ours: we have a freemium model and use zero tracking. We don't collect personal information through DNT+, period. We make money when our customers choose to buy one of our premium products, like [DeleteMe](http://www.abine.com/deletemedetail.php). We don't have any trackers on our site or in DNT+, and we don't sell (or have) user data through our add-ons. In sum, Ghostery is monetized through Evidon, an advertising compliance company. DNT+ is monetized through consumers who decide to pay us.",®

t5_2qndt,pojut,1352393171,"As someone that straddles the line, let me tell you that asking this question is only going to cause you extreme frustration.  You see, what the Republican party is supposed to stand for, what it used to stand for, and even what it **says** it stands for, doesn't match up with what they actually *do*.  Republican (and, to an extent, Conservative) values include reducing the size of the federal government as much as reasonably possible, reducing the intrusion of federal laws into the daily lives of the common citizen, leveling the playing field so that the only thing holding back your success is *you* (and a bit of luck, of course), and just generally letting people live their lives. Those common slogans you hear about freedom, liberty, etc? They're not just empty platitudes; they're accurate and correct representations of what Republican beliefs actually are.  Sounds good, right? Well, here's where the frustration comes in. The actual Republican **Party** does almost none of those things. They advocate ""shrinking"" the size of government while exploding the size of our military. They advocate ""keeping government out of our lives"" while condoning the war on (some) drugs, regulating marriage, pushing for prayer in public schools, etc. They advocate people having the freedom to make it on their own, while heavily stacking the deck against the common man in the form of massive corporations lining the pockets of Congress (all while claiming that it's ""just the way the free market goes"".) Worst of all, they advocate freedom of religion, so long as your religion involves praying to a half-naked guy nailed to two slats of wood.  Now, don't get me wrong: there are a LOT of Republicans out there that still hold True Republican® values, and the vast majority of them are honest, hard-working people. Unfortunately, these authentic Republicans aren't the ones running the party, and are often labeled as ""RINOs"" (Republicans in Name Only.)   In short, the Republican party has been hijacked by the very whackjobs that they accuse of ruining this country.",®

Sound quality is the best I have heard but I'm no authority on sound. the Mic is amazing, this was one of the key factors of buying it, Very clear with noise cancelling that really works, Due to the cups insulating the ears it has a Mic monitor as well, so you can hear yourself speak. the morphing is Fun, and the volume roller and mute is in a good position. the battery life was around 11 hours to begin with - now a year later its around 10 hours (takes around 2hours to fully charge) radius is crazy good... The freedom is great. The disconnecting issue seems to be more related to which usb port you have it plugged into and/or what the other adjacent usb ports are doing, particularly Usb3 ports, their activity interferes with the same frequency logitech uses, this is a motherboard/hardware issue that's apparently well known, and not logitechs fault. however perhaps if logitech moved to different band the problem will disappear. experiment with your ports 'till you find a good one, I found the furthest usb2 port away from mobo did the trick.

t5_2qpol,Emperor_Mao,1352472340,"As someone that straddles the line, let me tell you that asking this question is only going to cause you extreme frustration. You see, what the Republican party is supposed to stand for, what it used to stand for, and even what it says it stands for, doesn't match up with what they actually do. Republican (and, to an extent, Conservative) values include reducing the size of the federal government as much as reasonably possible, reducing the intrusion of federal laws into the daily lives of the common citizen, leveling the playing field so that the only thing holding back your success is you (and a bit of luck, of course), and just generally letting people live their lives. Those common slogans you hear about freedom, liberty, etc? They're not just empty platitudes; they're accurate and correct representations of what Republican beliefs actually are. Sounds good, right? Well, here's where the frustration comes in. The actual Republican Party does almost none of those things. They advocate ""shrinking"" the size of government while exploding the size of our military. They advocate ""keeping government out of our lives"" while condoning the war on (some) drugs, regulating marriage, pushing for prayer in public schools, etc. They advocate people having the freedom to make it on their own, while heavily stacking the deck against the common man in the form of massive corporations lining the pockets of Congress (all while claiming that it's ""just the way the free market goes"".) Worst of all, they advocate freedom of religion, so long as your religion involves praying to a half-naked guy nailed to two slats of wood. Now, don't get me wrong: there are a LOT of Republicans out there that still hold True Republican® values, and the vast majority of them are honest, hard-working people. Unfortunately, these authentic Republicans aren't the ones running the party, and are often labeled as ""RINOs"" (Republicans in Name Only.) In short, the Republican party has been hijacked by the very whackjobs that they accuse of ruining this country.",®

t5_2cneq,pojut,1352479311,"As someone who only decided to vote on the day before the election (more on that in a second), I'll chime in here. Personally, I **refuse** to vote against someone. To me, a vote means that I **support** someone, not that I **don't** support someone else. You can argue all day long about the practicality of this approach vis a vis reality, but it won't change the fact that I'll only vote in favor of someone. Choosing between ""the lesser of two evils"" is a pointless exercise to me, and the only time a vote could be considered truly wasted.  Now, on to why I personally almost didn't vote this year. I was planning on voting for Buddy Roemer (I vehemently disagree with the guy socially, but almost 100% agree with him fiscally.) Once he dropped out of the race, completely conceded, and then endorsed Gary Johnson, I took it to mean he didn't want people writing him in. An assumption on my part to be sure, but there it is all the same. Because of this, I was content to sit out the election. While I'm *very* glad that Obama beat out Romney, I don't personally support Obama. As previously mentioned, this means I wouldn't actually vote for him, even though I wanted him to ""win"" when compared to Romney.  The only reason why I ended up voting (and, yes, I did write Roemer in, even though it didn't really matter in the grand scheme of things) was, as pointed out by my wife, the large number of important ballot initiatives in the state we live, Maryland. We had gay marriage (voted in favor of), an increase in the number of gambling permits to increase total tax revenue while lowering the tax burden on individual MD casinos (voted in favor of), an initiative granting police higher-ups the ability to make certain decisions without the approval of the police union (voted in favor of)...lots of important stuff. If I recall, we had a total of 10 or 11 ballot initiatives, all of them a fairly Big Deal®.  So, to sum it all up: I, and many others, refuse to vote against someone. Voting for someone, or voting on a lot of important ballot initiatives, are the only two ways to get me in a booth. Trying to convince me to vote **against** someone is the fastest way to make me want to sit on the sidelines. ",®

In this case we're talking about pen digitizers. Pressure based digitizers work differently than the Wacom digitizers, for example, and you see it when a Wacom pen can be detected without touching the screen. The capacitive sensors are using (IIRC) our natural body electrostatic to detect touch, and so the pen mimics that by doing the same.

Combattants islamistes près de Tombouctou, en avril. © AFP/Romaric Ollo Hien Alors qu'une intervention armée dans le nord du Mali se précise, les jihadistes affluent. Parmi eux, des jeunes venus des camps sahraouis. Enquête sur une dérive mafieuse et terroriste. Lentement, inexorablement, la perspective d'une guerre des sables pour la reconquête du Nord-Mali, désormais planifiée sans plus de précisions pour le premier quadrimestre de 2013, se rapproche. À Tombouctou, à Gao, à Bourem, à Tessalit et dans toutes les localités de l'Azawad quotidiennement survolées par des avions de surveillance, les jihadistes s'organisent dans la fièvre pour la mère de toutes leurs batailles. Un vent de paranoïa souffle sur les katibas d'Aqmi, du Mujao et d'Ansar Eddine, qui multiplient contrôles et arrestations au sein d'une population civile soupçonnée d'abriter la cinquième colonne de l'ennemi impie. Des caches d'armes, de carburant et de munitions sont creusées à la hâte autour de la demi-douzaine de camps d'entraînement récemment ouverts pour accueillir les nouvelles recrues venues de tous les recoins d'un « Sahelistan » qui s'étend de l'Atlantique au Darfour, attirées autant par les primes offertes - jusqu'à 3 000 euros par individu - que par les mirages de la guerre sainte. En petits détachements de 40 à 60 hommes, jusqu'à 300 volontaires selon les services de renseignements français sont ainsi arrivés courant octobre à Tombouctou et Gao, dont une bonne partie, pour ne pas dire l'essentiel selon les témoins, s'expriment en hassaniya, le dialecte arabe des Maures et des Sahraouis. Rendue publique par l'AFP le 21 octobre et développée depuis dans plusieurs reportages, l'information selon laquelle des membres du Front Polisario auraient rejoint le Nord-Mali a été aussitôt démentie par la direction du mouvement indépendantiste, le ministère français des Affaires étrangères précisant de son côté qu'il n'avait « pas eu connaissance » de liens entre le Polisario et les jihadistes. À juste titre. L'on imagine mal, effectivement, Mohamed Abdelaziz et les chefs du Front s'acoquiner avec des groupes terroristes en guerre ouverte contre leur hôte algérien. Sauf que ni lui ni les autorités d'Alger ne sont jusqu'ici parvenus à enrayer la progression du virus salafiste chez les jeunes des camps de réfugiés de la région de Tindouf, encore moins à empêcher le départ de ces desperados d'un exil sans fin vers les rivages chimériques du jihad rétribué. Totalement occultée par les indépendantistes sahraouis et les médias algériens, l'existence dans les camps d'activistes se réclamant de la Salafiya Jihadiya (ou, plus récemment, d'Ansar el-Charia) n'est pas un phénomène récent. Importé à la fin des années 1990 par des étudiants sahraouis rentrés des universités algériennes et de cette pépinière salafiste que fut l'Institut théologique saoudien de Nouakchott (fermé en 2003), l'islamisme radical trouve rapidement un écho favorable dans trois mosquées très fréquentées du désert : Omar Ibn Al-Khattab (camp dit de Smara), Abou Bakr Assedik (camp dit d'Aousserd) et Alkitab wa Assouna (camp de Laayoune). C'est là qu'ont lieu les premiers recrutements, sous la houlette d'imams autoproclamés tels que Mohamed Salem Lahbichi et Abba Ould Saleh, alias Abou Salman. La première participation connue de salafistes radicaux issus des rangs du Polisario à une tentative d'opération terroriste remonte à décembre 2003, lorsque la police mauritanienne arrête, à Nouadhibou, un ancien soldat de l'Armée populaire de libération sahraouie (APLS) pour vol d'explosifs. Il s'agit là d'un acte isolé, mais son auteur, Baba Ould Mohamed Bakhili, reconnaît très vite travailler pour le compte du Groupe salafiste pour la prédication et le combat, le GSPC, qui deviendra Al-Qaïda au Maghreb islamique (Aqmi) en janvier 2007. Acide nitrique Cette connexion se vérifie quatre mois plus tard lors du démantèlement, toujours en Mauritanie, d'une filière de recrutement jihadiste dont l'animateur, Mohamed Lamine Ould Louleïd, dit Maaouya, vient des camps de Tindouf. Elle se confirme de façon spectaculaire en juin 2005 quand deux katibas du GSPC, la katiba des Moulathamine de l'Algérien Mokhtar Belmokhtar, et la katiba Tarek Ibn Ziad, dont le noyau dur est composé de Sahraouis, prennent d'assaut le poste mauritanien de Lemgheity. Elle ne fera plus de doute au cours des années suivantes, à l'occasion de plusieurs accrochages violents survenus en Algérie (attaque de la brigade de gendarmerie d'El-Menia, en avril 2006), en Mauritanie (démantèlement d'une cellule d'Aqmi dont l'objectif était d'assassiner l'ambassadeur d'Israël, en octobre 2008) ou au Niger (combat de Telemses entre la katiba Tarek Ibn Ziad et l'armée nigérienne, en décembre 2009). À chaque fois, des Sahraouis ayant reçu une formation militaire dans les camps du Polisario sont impliqués.      Les émirs d'Aqmi recrutent au sein des camps du Polisario.  Pour Abdelmalek Droukdel, le chef suprême d'Aqmi, et les émirs successifs de la zone sud - Yahia Djouadi, Nabil Makhloufi et depuis peu Djamel Oukacha, alias Yahia Abou el-Hamman -, recruter au sein des camps du Polisario est à la fois un moyen de combler les pertes dans leurs propres rangs et l'assurance d'obtenir des moudjahidine aguerris, connaissant parfaitement le terrain saharien. Arrêté au Mali en novembre 2007 alors qu'il cherchait à se procurer une quantité importante d'acide nitrique, puis extradé en Mauritanie où il purge depuis une peine de dix années de prison, Hakim Ould Mbarek, fils d'un fonctionnaire du protocole du Polisario, illustre un autre aspect de cette collaboration : le trafic. Avec son complice Maaouya (cité plus haut), il détournait dans les camps de réfugiés des stocks de médicaments, de munitions et de pièces de rechange, puis les enfouissait dans des caches repérables par GPS, avant de les vendre aux jihadistes. Une dérive mafieuse qui va rapidement prendre de l'ampleur. Le 7 septembre 2009, quatre cadres du Polisario dont l'adjoint du commandant de la Ire région militaire Taleb Ami Deih sont kidnappés en territoire algérien par un gang d'Arabes Bérabiche du Nord-Mali et emmenés à Taoudenni avant d'être libérés quelques jours plus tard contre le paiement d'une rançon par la direction du mouvement indépendantiste. En cause : une cargaison de cannabis venue du Maroc et non livrée à ses destinataires maliens. Deux mois plus tard, trois humanitaires espagnols sont enlevés sur l'axe Nouakchott-Nouadhibou par un groupe se réclamant d'Aqmi et dirigé par Omar Ould Hamma (dit Omar Sahraoui), ex-membre du Polisario naturalisé malien et trafiquant notoire. Capturé à son tour par des agents mauritaniens à Gao, puis exfiltré vers Nouakchott, Omar Sahraoui sera finalement échangé en août 2010 contre les humanitaires qu'il avait ravis. En décembre 2010, un nouvel incident survient entre l'armée mauritanienne et une colonne de trabendistes sahraouis. Arrêtés, ces derniers citent le nom de leur commanditaire, Mohamed Ould el-Mhaidi, alias Rubio, baron régional de la drogue, ex-cadre de la IIe région militaire du Polisario et proche du patron des services de sécurité du Front, Mohamed Ould Laakik. Réalité sordide Dans la nuit du 22 au 23 octobre 2011 enfin, c'est le coup d'éclat, mais aussi le coup de grâce pour la crédibilité sécuritaire du Polisario. Deux humanitaires espagnols et une italienne sont kidnappés au camp de Rabbouni, à quelques dizaines de mètres des locaux abritant la présidence de la République arabe sahraouie démocratique (RASD) et amenés dans la localité malienne d'El-Khalil, non loin de la frontière algérienne (ils seront libérés neuf mois plus tard). Considéré comme l'acte fondateur du Mujao, la branche dissidente d'Aqmi qui règne aujourd'hui sur la ville de Gao, et revendiqué par son chef militaire, le Malien Ahmed Tilemsi, alias Abderahmane Ould el-Ameur, ce rapt a été commis par des Arabes Bérabiche guidés par une poignée de Sahraouis, dont les dénommés Aghdafna Hamadi Ould Ahmed Baba et Mamina Ould Laghfin. Familier de Rabbouni, ce dernier finira par être arrêté (et débriefé) par les services mauritaniens à Nouadhibou, le 5 décembre 2011. Là encore, cette opération terroriste à connotation religieuse recouvrait une réalité sordide : un règlement de comptes entre trafiquants.      Aucun barrage, aucune patrouille, aucun champ de mines ne pourra empêcher la jeunesse sahraouie de prendre la piste de Tombouctou.  Les autorités algériennes se sont longtemps contentées de mettre en garde la direction du Polisario, preuves à l'appui. À plusieurs reprises, des camions militaires sont venus déposer à l'intérieur des camps les dépouilles de Sahraouis enrôlés dans les rangs du GSPC (puis d'Aqmi), tués lors d'opérations de ratissage. De son côté, le Front a réagi avec embarras, mais sans la vigueur escomptée, se contentant de procéder au « nettoyage » de quelques mosquées suspectes et de remettre pour interrogatoire à la gendarmerie algérienne une dizaine de salafistes du camp d'Aousserd, en juillet 2008.

t5_2qh63,rightc0ast,1352529489,"&gt; Call me cynical, but I don't think listening to Rothbard and Paul everyday made him a very intelligent man. It is always difficult to learn much about a man by one sentence, but this is a guy who walked on a stage, in front of many cameras, and thought this was something he needed to say. He probably thought it was funny, he probably thought it was smart.  It's referred to in the game as throwing red meat. I don't like it, and couldn't personally do it. I think that Ron couldn't either, despite having religious views where inside his head *he's thinking the exact same thing*. Things like this pandering are why I could never get on the stage at the RNC, and why Ron never did.   It's why Rand will probably at least be able to attempt a serious run in a few years. Shifting demographics will probably mean an apology of sorts for this, eventually. Something else his father refused to do. Americans *love* an apology and atonement. Hell, some of our most successful modern politicians have apologized for being in the klan.   I mostly agree with everything else though. Philosophically at least.   The religious baggage makes almost everyone involved suspect, and more to the point, not true libertarians^®  &gt; No one's liberty is limited if homosexuals aren't allowed to marry, but surely gay couples are stripped of certain liberties if it is not allowed.  It's that religious baggage again. It allows a person who has spoken in most other regards in ways that such a stance is really surprising ... yet they can sit there and rationalize it as something not that differnt than this. (note, I disagree. Just pointing it out)  &gt; Look, given the existence of the state itself, and the republican nature of US governance, this is a state's right's issue. Some will allow it, which is their prerogative, but I don't think they should. No one's freedom is limited. All gays are still free to marry, they just choose not to do so. There is no clause that says you *must* love a person you marry, and if they want tax breaks, a gay male and female couple could meet up and get the breaks. They are both free to the same degree you and I are. We are all free to marry a member of the opposite sex. That's marriage. That's the legislation, even though I don't think government should be in the business of marriage at all!  It's hard to swallow ... but inside the head of the person who believes there is a sky king ruling our eternal existence ... it's not something I can't understand if I put myself in their shoes. It's ... unfortunate. ",®

There is no way it can be removed from the controlled substance act because it is medicinal.  It should be considered a Schedule V drug though and sold over the counter, in my opinion.    Schedule V - The drug or other substance has a low potential for abuse relative to the drugs or other substances in Schedule IV and has a currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States. Abuse of the drug or other substances may lead to limited physical dependence or psychological dependence relative to the drugs or other substances in Schedule IV.

It's bound to be predominantly consisting of things rejected by the main communities (otherwise it would be posted on main ones), and therefore full of constant stream of butthurt.  That's for the stillborn projects. Another category is subs that have their purpose in additional radicalisation - SRSwomen, SRSmicroaggressions, SRSrecovery, and SRSPoC. There is not purpose to these subs other than to spew racism and sexism. It's the type of this that would not be acceptable anywhere, but exists on SRS in order to ""guide"" their users into the right direction.

I refuse to address the Thunderbolt - if you truly think that it makes the Air any better than the machine I found at Best Buy, then you must also think that Firewire is the coolest thing since sliced bread.

His friends think I'm bad news but the issue is that I had an undiagnosed and untreated illness. At the times when I was not in control and said really hurtful things I truly felt that I was valid in my perceptions, but now I see what was really my responsibility.  I now have regular contact with my ex. I have to be really mindful when I am around him though, so I don't fall back into old habits or dynamics of our past relationship. The only way I was capable in regaining a friendship was in going into treatment for BPD. Until of late, he hasn't really understood what BPD is compared to the diagnosis of bipolar which I thought I was when we were together. Also, in the process of treatment I have become more aware of myself, like when my bpd thoughts and behaviors start creeping in. Because of this awareness, I was able to truly apologize for the pain I caused him, a true apology.  It kills me to think I hurt him. But the best thing I can do is keep bettering myself more and more. What I have realized is that I truly love him, not for my selfish needs anymore, but for the beautiful, peaceful, brilliant ( I could go on and on 😊) person he is. He is worth going to Drs. and if in the long run we don't end up together I am going to be a better person either way.  If you don't mind me asking, how long were you two together? Is there realistically a chance you two could get back together? And Why don't you go seek treatment?

I’m a bit of an aloof, quirky, and sometimes depressed girl, and I somehow give the impression of being a bitch even though deep down I truly care about being close to people.    To give some background, I grew up in an EXTREMELY religious household with a mother who was mentally and emotionally unstable.  As soon as I left the church, I ended up in a relationship with someone who was very loving, but also disturbed (and did lots of drugs) and I felt like I didn’t have the chance to discover my new identity outside of religion.  Long story short: I broke up with him hoping to rediscover myself, he went a little crazy and we ended up in an argument that ended in him resorting to physical violence and trashing my apartment…And despite all of that, he found someone else and seems happy. I realize that it can’t have been a healthy relationship to begin with if it ended like that, but every time I look at myself and see a failure because I can’t win over a crowd like some other girls can, I can’t help but think of how comforting the relationship was and of how I had someone who never would have broken up with me. I still blame myself for the way things ended, and it's making me feel too inadequate to even try out new hobbies.   I know the whole complaining about break ups thing may sound whiny, but I would appreciate input on what things any of you have found helpful in overcoming personal flaws and anxiety, starting a life from scratch or just things you enjoy doing by yourself that you think make you a better person to be around!

t5_2ra79,aspophilia,1352680512,"Thank you so much you guys. I will respond individually soon.  He never responded to my request to talk so I wrote this. It pretty much says it all but I am still scared to hit send;  ""I wanted to say this in person. I want to hear your responses and look you in the eyes so I know what you tell me is the truth. So I can let this go knowing I have all the information and that there is no further reason to believe that there is any hope that we'll ever be together. If you were here I'd ask:  ""Do you love me?"" I imagine you would say no.  ""Do you want to be with me?"" I imagine you would say no or that you don't know.   Then I would tell you I love you. More than I've ever loved anyone. That I want to be with you so badly and that I wish we could have another real chance. Because we're good together. We fit. I appreciate your intelligence and understand you better than most people probably do. We are alike. Just being close to you makes me happy. But I know that's not true for you. Despite us being such a great match you want someone else. Someone who doesn't want you. And I think even when she's remarried you will still wait for her.   I didn't lie to you when I said I didn't feel like a booty call. I didn't feel used. But last night when she texted you and you sat right next to me and called her.... something clicked and I realized that I was really just in denial of what we are. Of what I am to you.  The thing is, I love you too much to watch you wait and torture yourself over something that will never happen and I respect myself too much to pine and wait for you like you wait for her. Because unlike you I can see that I have to let go. It's not healthy for either of us to do this. I can't make love to you... kiss you and touch you.... only for you to walk away from me right after like it means nothing when it means everything to me. Despite how close and connected I feel to you when we have sex and how passionate it is, I don't think you feel any of it. And then I cry myself to sleep because I miss you as soon as you go and I know that I will have to practically beg you to come back just so I can go through it all over again.   I'm not sure you care about me at all. Even as a friend. Because if you did, when I say I needed to talk you would be here for me. You would patiently listen to me even if I was saying things you didn't want to hear. And you would be honest with me. You would help me let go. Instead you do to me what has been done to you despite how much you know it hurts. It's not fair. I deserve more from you than that.   I love you with my whole heart. I miss you every moment and I think about what things could be like if we were together. I think about the things we use to talk about after I first emailed you. When you said you could picture us snuggling on the couch on Sunday mornings while the kids played. It was just a fantasy. It wasn't real. But I just want it so badly that I can't let it go.    Knowing you would rather be alone than with me.... that what I have offered you and after giving all of myself to you, that I'm still somehow not good enough.... it's too painful. I've never felt so worthless. I feel like nothing because even at my best you can't love me. Or you won't. Not just that but you won't even try.   I don't know what else to say. I don't know if you will respond to this. I honestly don't think you will. I know it's difficult for you to deal with things like this so you avoid it. It's easier to ignore than to deal with things that might be painful or messy. Easier to stick with the life you know than to change it even if it could be better. Easier to lose someone who loves you than to admit that you might be making the wrong choice.   I want to be your friend but maybe that's too hard right now. I want more than you're willing to give and I can't pretend I want less. I need time maybe, though I don't think it will make me stop loving you.   There is this fantasy in my head where you read this and suddenly realize what you could lose. That you would miss me. That you would tell me you want to try and give us another shot. But it's only a fantasy and I don't hold any hope for it. I'll still love you. For the rest of my life. And if we don't talk anymore after this please know that I will always miss you and I'll always want you. I really want you to be happy and I hope you find what you need.   You have no idea how hard it was for me to write this knowing it could mean you'll be gone and I'll never again get to feel your hands on my face before you kiss me or feel safe as you hold me as i lay next to you in bed. But I can't lie to myself and pretend I'm ok with how things are. If you don't want me I have to learn to accept that and let you go.   Love this powerful is rare and shouldn't be wasted but I heard once or twice that if you really love someone you should set them free. I really love you so I'm doing the only thing I can to prove it.  ❤  http://youtu.be/IwVeH9E6o_0 "" ",❤

t5_2tltc,selfabortion,1352684095,"I've done a fair amount of Kafka study and might be able to toss a couple things your way.  Unfortunately, it has been some years and I don't seem to have as many of my old papers/bibliographies as I'd have expected.  I haven't read any of the following sources in a long time, so the degree to which they help you may vary. If I find anything else, I'll edit and post it here.    Danielle Allen - ""Sounding Silence.""  MODERNISM / modernity. VOLUME EIGHT, NUMBER TWO, PP 325-334. © 2001 THE JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY PRESS  (This one focuses on ""In the Penal Colony,"" at least in the first portion that I re-skimmed.  If you don't have a way to pull the article, PM your e-mail address)  Everyone interested in Kafka owes it to themselves to read ""The Myth of Sisyphus"" by Albert Camus; he spends a lot of time on F.K. in that long essay.  It's a wonderful read, even if not the most academically rigorous.    I wrote a 20 pager that was essentially a Foucauldian interpretation of ""The Trial.""  The following citation is in my bibliography for it and may or may not talk about Kafka to any significant degree.  It has been several years since I wrote the paper though and I don't have access to a journal database to skim this article.   Hassan, Ihab Habib 1925- *Negative Capability Reclaimed: Literature and Philosophy Contra Politics* Philosophy and Literature - Volume 20, Number 2, October 1996, pp. 305-324 – Article  Here is one that mainly focuses on The Trial, but his themes are pretty consistent throughout all of his work, so might be worth a look:   Kundert-Gibbs.  “’I am powerful, and I am only the lowest 	Doorkeeper’: Power Play in Kafka’s The Trial and Pinter’s Victoria Station.”  Pinter at Sixty.  Ed. Katherine Burkman and John Kundert-Gibbs.  	Bloomington: Indiana University Press.  1993.  149-160.    Bonus trivia: Nobel Laureate Harold Pinter co-adapted ""The Trial"" into a pretty good film version, with Kyle MacLachlan (aka Dale Friggin' Cooper!) and Anthony Hopkins.   EDIT - George Steiner and John Updike are both writers of note who have written about Kafka in the introductions to various of his works.  I'd search for their names and Kafka together to see if they have put out anything in addition to those.    Here's another to try that I'm fairly positive I read at some point: [Authority, Autonomy, and Choice: The Role of Consent in the Moral and Political Visions of Franz Kafka and Richard Posner](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1737920)  Another thing: Walter Benjamin is a pretty heavyweight theorist who I believe has written a moderate amount about Franz Kafka.  Try searching any journal databases you have access to for items with both of those names.  ",©

If it was just a symbolic grave why dig a hole and fill it back up? Are we assuming that the fat zombie Rick stabbed in the gut ate ALL of Lori's remains? Even her bones? Then what did they bury in her grave? If they did bury her how did they retrieve her corpse in front of crazy-ass Rick without him noticing? Did they get her before Rick got to her? If so then why didn't THEY kill the swollen bellied walker? This episode had displeased me and left me with far too many questions. Everything is forgiven though because of Daryl and the ass-kicking baby ♥ Also is anyone else disappointed that there were no little crawling walker babies in the nursery? EDIT- OK so it never occurred to me that Lori may have survived and Carol took away her body.

I even left it running for a few days extra so I wouldn't have to pay much attention to the tank while I got back into the swing of work.

t5_2qh0y,lexyeevee,1352836351,"You know I still have a soft spot for Perl, and you know I know the language fairly well, but I still remember _exactly_ why Python felt like such a breath of fresh air.  It was three things, really.  **Data structures.**  I was so, so sick of having to slap `@{...}` and `%{...}` all over the place in any code that did more than set a few keys or tried to be remotely clever.  Especially when wrapped in a `map` block, and maybe then wrapped in an anonymous hashref; that is too many levels of different braces.  This is somewhat better in current Perl, where the builtins understand references.  Current Perl wasn't around when I switched to Python.  :)  **Cheap classes.**  I don't mean in the sense of ""classes are really hard in perl, wahh"".  I mean in the sense of _I write one line and now I have a class_.  I don't have to make a `package` declaration (or, more likely, a new file) and import something; I just say ""this is a class"" and then it is a class.  The difference in effort sounds small, but it felt like a huge barrier was removed.  In Perl, classes feel like a scarce resource that I should dole out carefully; in Python, they're just another language feature.  **Exception handling.**  Low blow.  Sorry.  But it _works_ in Python.  It half-works a thousand different ways in Perl.  Also pretty nice: **first-class keyword arguments**, eliminating a problem Perl still can't agree on how to solve.  **Bound methods** were a surprising nicety, too, though hardly switch-worthy.  And while I _despised_ the **whitespace** at first, it has since occurred to me that I was delimiting blocks once for humans and once for computers, and now braces just feel like worthless noise.  I do miss some clever tricks from Perl, like `import` shenanigans and syntax extensions via `sub(&amp;)` and dynamic scoping♥ and Moose's freeish type constraints.  But Perl also lacks Python's bag of tricks, like decorators and first-class metaclasses and generators.  And I think Python's metaprogramming on the whole is slightly more approachable and looks somewhat less like black magic.    _Addendum:_ There is one other very major and understated advantage Python has here, and that is that it is **replicatable**.  That is, someone else can build an alternative Python interpreter and be reasonably confident that it can be compatible with stock Python.  In fact, this has happened multiple times, to great effect: we have Cython for writing C extensions with Python syntax (compare XS, good lord), we have Jython and IronPython if that's your bag, and we have an extremely promising JIT experiment in PyPy.  Perl has `perl`.",♥

Start with having the system in standby (redlight is on)  2. Hold the power button down; the system will turn on and turn off once again.  3. Press and hold the power button again and keep holding, it will beep as it turns on and then it will double beep. When you hear the double beeps immediately take your finger off the power button (if your system turns off before you get a double beep just try again and hold the button, it should double beep the 2nd time you try)   4. You will be prompted to plug in your controller via USB and then hit the PS button  You will now have a screen with these options :  1. Restart System: Restarts the PLAYSTATION®3 System. 2.

I’ll list a few relevant sections and then make a note on how I read Nietzsche re. logic (and subsequently knowledge).  From his corpus I’d say the Gay Science has a lot on your topic(s), and its treatments are well worth reading. In particular, check:  * §109: *Let us beware.*—nature of the universe and our anthropomorphisms; idea of de-deification/reintegration into nature; * §110: *Origin of knowledge.*—the idea of the incorporation of truth as a condition of life (probably worth reading OTL first); * **§111: *Origin of the logical.*—**origin? logic/illogic; the basic idea of there being ‘equal’ things; follows from §110 on the evolutionary nature of these ideas, as in, how they benefitted a species; * **§112: *Cause and effect.*—**worth reading for so many reasons, but specifically as this is positioned immediately after the origin of knowledge and logic which precede it. * §115: *The four errors.*—might as well… (flows from the others) * **§121: *Life no argument.*—**the conditions of life may include ‘error’… * **§335: *Long live physics!*—**a slightly longer, but brilliant section. Well worth reading for the sentiment and ideas of logic, knowledge, the objects of knowledge, causality, …  (Most of the start of book three—which starts with §108—is worth reading. The line of inquiry and the ideas are related in ways that keep me re-reading them, finding new and intriguing things most times. They also relate strongly to many other parts of his corpus, and contain some of the core motifs of his work.)  §§354–355 are also worth reading as they continue his earlier thoughts on the origin of knowledge.  Reading §112 and §335 together and looking for links and ideas between the two is well worth it.  Edit: TL/OTL—On Truth and Lies in a Extra-Moral Sense/On Truth and Lies in a Non-Moral Sense (I prefer the former, as it’s closer to the German (*Über Wahrheit und Lüge im außermoralischen Sinn*). It’s freely available online in PDF/doc/whatever. In many aspects this is staple, although it precedes the Gay Science and many of his later works that followed in the 18880s. It’s just a short essay and quite a nice read (even here his use of language is quite… captivating—it’s a worthy read).  As for general text availability, (more on that below) Wikipedia/Wikisource should also have a lot of Nietzsche’s stuff, though translations might not be as good as that of Kaufmann (which is what I’ve found—I really prefer Kaufmann’s as they are much ‘truer’ to the original German, which I read too).  If you don’t have access to a copy of The Gay Science I believe the Kaufmann translations are available online somewhere, and they’re dirt cheap (like $5–10, if that) from most online bookstores. Happy to also point you in the direction of even further reading if you like. :3  ===  Now, as for your questions…  My own reading is that, no, Nietzsche would not accept a logical proof for the existence of God… a meta-narrative deity figure?—given his writing on theology, the death of God, the shadows of the dead God, … etc.—certainly not. As for logic generally… my take is he would not discount it—it has usefulness (it’s has become the cornerstone of our computing in many ways). I do not see him refuting it as it being either outright ‘false’ or egregious, **but** must be considered in relation to the idea of ‘truth’. If there can only be a perspectival truth, that is rooted contextually to the time, the ‘subject’, and how they inscribe themselves in the world, then a system of logic that deems that there are things that are equal, or that we could presume mutual inclusivity/exclusivity becomes suddenly complex and problematised.  For example, I feel he would refuse to accept that the [law of noncontradiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_noncontradiction) was primeval and somehow intrinsic to the world, the universe, and it’s just a dandy happenstance that we humans crawling on this planet were smart enough—apart from the millions of other species that preceded us on this planet alone, and even now—to ‘discover’ or figure such a thing out. Nietzsche’s perspectivism would challenge the LNC, for these two statements that would otherwise be mutually exclusive could be both be true, at the same time, in the same sense, from different perspectives (and contexts). And this ‘truth’ cannot be denied to any of the perspectives, for they hold true for that person under that perspective, time, context, …. (Alenka Zupančič has written on this in the latter half of her book *The Shortest Shadow*, specifically taking the idea of a point-of-view as ≠ the gaze of a ‘subject’, which extends the idea of Nietzsche’s perspectivism as being more than the mere PoV of a subject. See below on the subject–object dialectic.) For him, all these concepts are *ours*, and given perspectivism, cannot be held to somehow be absolutely, positively true above all, to all, as a fundamental law (following from §121):  &gt; *Life no argument.*—We have arranged for ourselves a world in which we can live—by positing bodies, lines, planes, causes and effects, motion and rest, form and content; without these articles of faith nobody now could endure life. But that does not prove them. Life is no argument. The conditions of life might include error.  In this sense ‘logic’ is a cognitive requirement per se, which we have developed over a *long* time. By now we’ve honed it (that does not by any means require it to be *‘better’*), and then made use of it for everything under the sun (including morality). Further, we can’t demonstrate that these laws of logic have a direct counterpart from which we deduce them in the world, nor, necessarily, that they apply to other species.  The same thus applies to mathematics. We cannot do away with them ‘entirely’, as they are functional (either evolutionarily, or, now technologically) necessities upon which our lives are now conditional—we rely upon them for so much. However, and crucially I think, Nietzsche, wants us to tickle the idea that ‘untruth’ or error can be a condition of life… (see Beyond Good and Evil §4 here too).  At this point it’s actually quite interesting to see how some of these sections elude to the idea that these ideas—which carry an *ontological character*—are subtly, but firmly embossed syntactically in our language (language does not ‘objectively’ represent reality…). It’s incredibly difficult to think, as it were, from a position outside of the human; from a ‘neutral’, ‘perfectly’ or ‘purely rational’ or disinterested position—it’d be an absurd impossibility. We remain looking at “life from within life itself”, and Nietzsche wants to *affirm* that (to do otherwise is the deny or negate life, viz., *asceticism*). (There is some stuff I’ve come across which actually toys with the idea of Nietzsche as poking at some of the limitations of the subject–object dialectic here, but I’m still poking my toes into the water in that regard, Zupančič being one.)  Mhh. In closing, my feeling really is that Nietzsche, in casting doubt over these domains of epistemology, logic, philosophy, science, … is not just casting their methodologies into doubt and question, but chiefly, their premises. They rest on a *very* different conception of ‘truth’ from that which he has developed—cf. foundationalism, positivism, or those of idealism, or even the Kantian real/apparent distinction…—and most importantly, having questioned and displaced these premises, all these questions of epistemology suddenly (also…) become *ontological* in character—they concern the nature of being itself (of *being*, and of *becoming*). We cannot endure a science that denies this character, and must come to a new, more vibrant, audacious, experimental, playful, perspectival way of being (ala «a *gay science*»).  ===  **Note on Nietzsche’s language and “objectivity”:**  I just wanted to add an additional note with respects to Nietzsche’s choice of language in some of the above sections. First off, be wary of investing into common value judgements (i.e. moral evaluations) of things like ‘stronger’, ‘weaker’, ‘the herd’, and orders of rank (‘higher’/‘lower’). These carry a different meaning than what we today commonly attribute to them (e.g. strong = better; weak = bad). If you’re keen on reading more and being sensitive to Nietzsche’s use of these adjectives reading Genealogy of Morals is vital.  As for “objectivity”: Nietzsche rejects this as *an ideal* (and a severely delimiting one at that). Perspectivism ≠ pure relativism, that is, it’s not just a case of accepting that others may see or understand thing X in a different manner to you, and that thus experiences are subjectively mediated (and thus knowledge and ‘truth’ correspondingly carries this subjective element which *must thus be accounted for*). No—Nietzsche’s perspectivism extends beyond this. We cannot ‘attain’ or ‘yield’ or necessarily even come ‘closer’ to an “objective knowledge” by ‘adding up’ all our perspectives, as if it would reveal all/more/as many aspects of an object. Nietzsche rejects that an object carries intrinsic properties that we must thus embark to discover—this is an outright rejection of previous metaphysical narratives, including—especially—Kant’s the thing-in-itself. To posit the existence of such a (noumenal) realm (or any other system of epistemology/science/philosophy that does anything similar) relocates the question of truth to the metaphysical (*…shadows of the dead God…*), a *metaphysical truth*.  &gt; *This reflecting on the reflection is the surest way to avoid the question of the gaze, a question that most certainly does not coincide with the point from which we look at things and reflect upon them.* **The fundamental disjunction at stake in any process of knowledge is the disjunction between the “perspectival point” from which we look at things** (the standpoint or viewpoint) **and the point of the gaze (this being the place of the subject in the thing).** The true question concerns not where we stand when we are reflecting on a certain object, but, rather, **where we stand within this object itself.** (*The Shortest Shadow*, pp. 107–108)  Further (same page, IIRC):  &gt; The crucial point here is not to understand this in the all too common fashion: as the stance according to which all objects are constructed by something (be it the subject, or some sort of discourse) other than the object itself. The point is quite different: if all objects are constructed in the process of knowledge (or, for instance, in the process of speech about them), it is precisely because there is an irreducible object-element in them (in the pursuit of which we “construct” the object). To put it differently: if objective reality is constituted, not simply given, this is because something of the order of the object is given. What stands in the way of the ideal of purely objective knowledge is not some subjective element, but, rather, an element of the object itself. And I am not talking about some inert matter that the subject’s gaze can never penetrate; I am talking about the gaze itself as the (irreducible) object-within-the-object.  [This coincides with N. on the ‘unknowability of actions’, of the new, and the general idea of an excess of life all definitions of life (hitherto, and generally)—hence his call for an affirmation of life and its disclosures…]  Zupančič makes use of the Lacanian concept of ‘the gaze’ here, but I feel like the point comes across (it’s been a few years since I’ve touched the little Lacan I’ve done, and having just read the relevant passages of Nietzsche I feel like I can tag along fine). This is essentially a reiteration of the above, that our point of view and our ‘gaze’ do not coincide. We ‘objectify’ reality under the subject–object dialectic (for that is how we relate today at a meta-level to the world, viz., “I am a *subject* that senses *objects*…”), and we invest or ‘inscribe’ ourselves into the very objects which we constitute (conceptually, through language, through speech, …). In this sense we are ourselves constituted in and through the objects which we perceive and then ‘understand’/render intelligible/… (there’s another problem here too: the presumption of ‘wholeness’ in objects). Again, there is no innate ‘intelligibility’ or “intelligible character/essence of things” (again cf. Kant, idealism, foundationalism, positivism, …).  And thus, to bring it back to logic, any system of logic that is placed on a pedestal, as a metaphysical truth, from which we proceed denies Nietzsche’s perspectivism, his conception of truth, his understanding of language; his understanding of life, being, and becoming. Systems of logic are useful to us—we may utilise them toward some goal, but the possibilities of deriving this truth or that falsity are preset and conditional upon the basic presumptions he outlined in the early parts of GS: III (e.g. presumption of existence of equal entities, presumption of mutual inclusivity/exclusivity, and precisely *what* we hold to be equal/unequal, inclusive/exclusive—again, presumption of ‘wholeness’ also). A perspectivist approach would clash with any such system that replaces previous elevations of truth upon the metaphysical pedestal once held by ‘God’ (God is dead… shadows of the dead God…).  ===  I hope that wasn’t too long and didn’t venture too far off your questions. For quite a while I was skeptical of his treatment of logic too, but having read more of his corpus, specifically on his perspectivism I feel like I can better grasp what he is getting at, and how he feels warranted in defenestrating logic (which is what it read like upon a first glance).  (disclaimer) This is my reading of Nietzsche, directed in part by the course I’m doing. Also, I smashed this out in like ~~15~~ 30 minutes so I may have missed some crucial sections… :s  This stuff messes with my mind (and I kinda ♥ it). Any other Nietzscheans keen to wade in here? (:  ===  **tl;dr:** working from different conceptions of ‘truth’; logic, maths, … cause and effect, … etc. are conditions of life (in a variety of regards, esp. over time); read first 25 or so aphorisms of GS: III; ‘will to truth’ … knowledge as more than mere utility; life as a means to knowledge; a view of life from within life itself; importance of affective states; perspectivism.",♥

It seems as though the new patents that were awarded to Taiyo Kagaku are for mineral formulations in combination with L-theanine, as well as exclusive rights to sell it for specific applicaitons. [Source](http://www.nutraingredients-usa.com/Industry/New-patent-protects-Suntheanine-PMS-claim)  &gt;Taiyo Kagaku Co., Ltd., Japan has been awarded several manufacturing and use patents for Suntheanine®, which they have begun to strictly enforce. The patents cover several applications which include reducing anxiety, suppressing behavior problems of pets, reducing PMS symptoms, promoting relaxation, etc.  ___________________________________________________  &gt;The granting of a new US patent to Japan's Taiyo Kagaku for the use of pure form L-theanine brand Suntheanine with minerals to alleviate PMS symptoms  ______________________  So it looks like they own the patents for specific combination formulas and manufacturing techniques, as well as use patents for animal anxiety, women's health, etc. It does not appear that they hold the exclusive rights to the levorotory isomer anymore (if they ever did).

t5_2qhb9,B_boru,1353001623,"The government is currently considering new legislation regarding cannabis in order to allow the sale of sativex. It is expected that the legislation will be put forward in the new year.    ""Sativex is the world’s first prescription medicine derived from the cannabis plant. The medicine is standardized by both composition and dose and is being developed for the treatment of conditions such as spasticity in multiple sclerosis, cancer pain, and neuropathic pain of various origins  Sativex is administered as an oral spray which is absorbed by the patient’s mouth. Sativex® contains active ingredients called ‘cannabinoids’, which are extracted from cannabis plants grown and processed under strictly controlled conditions. It is composed primarily of a 1:1 ratio of two cannabinoids-CBD (cannabidiol-a non-psychoactive cannabinoid) and THC (delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol). The CBD:THC formulation is believed to enhance the therapeutic benefits of THC while modulating the unwanted psychotropic and other THC-related side effects, such as tachycardia. The spray delivery system keeps THC from entering the blood too rapidly and also minimizes the development of unwanted psychotropic effects.""  It will be interesting how the government can legislate that chemicals in a bottle are fine but the same chemicals on a leaf or bud are not.   The main difference will be the delivery system , using a spray rather than smoking.  But in general it is great that the media and general public seem to be educating themselves (even those that don't use or even want to use cannabis but also see that they should not deny it to others). Finally we might see the people of Ireland drag themselves into the 21st century and a step closer to true individual freedoms. ",®

Young's Literal Translation and the natural man doth not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for to him they are foolishness, and he is not able to know them, because spiritually they are discerned;  http://bible.cc/1_corinthians/2-14.htm  &gt;People who allow base urges and instincts to rule their lives are inverting the proper order of nature. That is not natural. If I'm understanding you correctly.  What is ""natural"" is how we are when we are born (i.e. in sin). ",©

The Company posted quarterly revenue of $36.0 billion and quarterly net profit of $8.2 billion, or $8.67 per diluted share. These results compare to revenue of $28.3 billion and net profit of $6.6 billion, or $7.05 per diluted share, in the year-ago quarter. Gross margin was 40.0 percent compared to 40.3 percent in the year-ago quarter. International sales accounted for 60 percent of the quarter’s revenue.

t5_2qvhj,goretsky,1353054913,"Hello,  All recent Thinkpads contain a whitelist in their BIOS firmware of wireless MiniPCIe cards that work with the device.  If you install a wireless MiniPCIe card that is not whitelisted, the machine with throw up an 1801 error on power up.  If you look at the T520's [hardware maintenance manual](http://support.lenovo.com/en_US/guides-and-manuals/detail.page?LegacyDocID=MIGR-76854) in the Parts Index section, you should find a listing of recognized wireless MiniPCIe cards.  These will be listed with a FRU (field replacement unit) number:  *  Intel Centrino®Wireless-N 1000 - 60Y3241  *  ThinkPad 1x1 b/g/n Wireless LAN Mini-PCI Express Adapter II - 60Y3247 *(I'm assuming this is currently installed one)*  *  Intel Centrino Advanced-N 6205 - 60Y3253  *  Intel Centrino Advanced-N 6300 - 60Y3233  *  Intel Centrino Advanced-N + WiMAX 6250 - 60Y3195  *  Intel Centrino Advanced-N + WiMAX 6250, Russia SKU - 60Y3209  Unless you are currently using a WiMAX (a/k/a 802.16e) network, I would suggest going with the 6205/60Y3253 if you have two wireless antennas in your W520 (for a maximum speed of 300Mbps), or the 6300/60Y3233 if you have three (max. speed 450Mbps).  The HMM should provide details on how many your model contains.  At the very least, the two-antenna model will always work.  As mentioned earlier, you need to get the specific whitelisted MiniPCIe card for your W520, a ""generic OEM"" will not work.  When making your purchase, search on the FRU number and get a unit that has that.  On eBay or Amazon, the listings will usually contain the FRU number as well as mention compatibility with your model of ThinkPad.  Regards,  Aryeh Goretsky ",®

The beauty in this, is you can run high quality Ethernet, preferably Cat6 and use it for any type of data, including audio/video with HDMI.  The typical max length for HDMI over Ethernet is 98 feet, though I would personally test my runs before integrating this into a final installation. This is much better than the 25 feet for the typical high-speed HDMI, or 65 feet with Redmere technology.

t5_2sfmf,LeeHyori,1353100600,"It does make sense what you wrote!  I mean, in some sense, at the end of the day, it looks like we have to make some consequentialist considerations. If, for example, we concede what you say about income disparity, then I suppose we would have to talk about whether or not government (a) is in fact the best tool to reduce income disparity, and (b) whether reducing income disparity is even a good thing. Once we think about that, we have to discuss what these ""good things"" are, and what the aim of all this policy-making is. So, is it just the preference for prosperity and wealth over impoverishment and suffering and misery? These are all philosophical considerations in some form or another. (♥)  Milton Friedman rejected principled libertarianism, and a bunch of libertarian thinkers hate him for it. He described himself as a pure consequentialist libertarian, and only valued ""liberty"" insofar as it was a variable in the consequentialist calculus. But even then, we could say that he was just a utilitarian, and really just philosophizing on those grounds. So, it looks like we can never escape the philosophical paradigm, but I understand what you're saying. Seems like it's a matter of higher order vs. lower order intellection. (I wrote a paper when I was a little younger about this: ""The three layers of intellection,"" which I think you kind of touch on here... It goes 1. Policy, 2. Ideology, 3. Philosophy.) But back to the main topic.  I think what you're trying to suggest is that there really is just a pragmatic aspect to all of this, and that trying so hard to commit ourselves to some abstract theory should not be our supreme priority. I just think that this in itself is a philosophical question that can be abstracted quite easily, but it's really hard to wrap my head around it all, so I can't articulate it well for you now.   On the whole, I do know myself to be someone who really does not like *ad hoc* solutions or judgments. I'm a big stickler for consistency and coherence, and I guess what I can extrapolate from you is that sometimes, we don't have time to think about these things when real people are actually suffering.

There is indeed marginal cost in the production of music - studio time, gear, engineers, producers, etc. You could arguably go as far as including marketing and promotion.   yeah well i can watch a movie that cost millions of dollars sometimes tens of millions to produce for free on TV. You cant explain that ©. Its no longer costs millions for the TV station to broadcast it. And they cover their expenses via revenue because the better is their programme the better is their REACH. The better is the REACH the better is the revenue. Same for the artists no?  Also continuing on movies vs music line most of costs of movies are recovered in theaters not in DVD's (lol DVD's). Why shouldnt most of the costs of the music be recovered on the concerts?  THe truth is the value labels add to the music is disproportionally small to the revenue share they receive from said music. They are no longer required and thus their share is starting to approximate actual value of their services. The ""market"" correction.That is all.",©

t5_2qore,exaltedgod,1353150754,"Yes and no. And I know some are not going to agree with this, but then again... this is contracting law. While you (MajorMajor) are sort of correct with the contracting agreement, you are not right on who and what the parties are in this case. So, let me clear some things up (respectfully of course =) ).  This here states the first ""party"" (Diablo 3) which in all legality is the game client itself (thus Blizzard as they own the rights to it) because it is the game client that is a ""software"" to your computer (i.e Party 1):  &gt;**The Diablo® III software program, and all files that are delivered to you by Blizzard Entertainment, Inc. (via on-line transmission or otherwise) to ""patch,"" update, or otherwise modify the software program, as well as all printed materials and electronic documentation (the ""Manual""), together with any and all copies and derivative works of such software program and Manual (collectively, the ""Game"") is the copyrighted work of Blizzard Entertainment, Inc. or its licensors (collectively, ""Blizzard"").**   &gt;Any and all uses of the Game are governed by the terms of this End User License Agreement (the ""License Agreement"" or ""Agreement"").  The second party is the end user BUT before the end user even gets a chance to get access to the paid service, they have to agree to be Party 2.  &gt;Before playing the Game, you must: (i) obtain an authorization code from a ‘box’ copy of the Game or through the Service; and (ii) **register for and log in using an authorized account with the Service (the ""Account""). The Game is distributed solely for use by authorized end users according to the terms of this License Agreement.** Any use, reproduction, modification or distribution of the Game not expressly authorized by the terms of this License Agreement is expressly prohibited.  **HOWEVER** Because Blizzard cannot see the difference between one user on a computer that logs in via a profile and another (for example me and my brother), the ""technical"" end user still has to be identified. For those that try to argue, ""Well you agreed to the ToS upon installation thus you are the end user,"" not technically as I could use an account and my brother could use the same account and unless he is there and agrees in a written and notarized way, there is no other way to be absolute that he agreed to the ToS. So, the only way to perform this is via the account log in. So, Party 2 is technically the account in which a person(s) signs up for before playing the game (it is referred to as the ""Account"" in the ToS). Being that this account is not hard coded into the chips on the motherboard of the computer and the fact the ""user"" has to use a browser to get to an account outside of the client itself makes this ""Account"" a software. (i.e. Party 2 -second software).  Now that we have Party 1 and 2, we can establish any any third parties that may or not not be authorized via the contract. Blizzard has said **""any unauthorized third-party software""**. Whether this is Loot Alert and I change the code by a letter to make it mine, whether I write a script to scrape the RAM to get information and have it displayed elsewhere. This is all a third party. Blue posts have said countless times (stuck behind a firewall at work and cannot reach the battle.net site for proof) if you have to use another tool other than the game and you, it is a third party, why risk it? But lets say I happen to be wrong, I am only human you know. So does this keyboard need a software other than the script that is written to display the information on it? More than likely yes. So there, that's another party outside of the agreement.  &gt;Official Blizzard Quote (Source) We've recently issued several rounds of account bans for cheating in Diablo III. In each of these cases players used a hack program for exploitive purposes, for example to zoom out their game view and kill monsters that were beyond the normal range at which AI is triggered. As we do with all Blizzard games, we will continue to monitor Diablo III for cheating and take action as needed. As a reminder, we don't permit the use of hacks or other third-party software in conjunction with Diablo III. Most of the programs out there that are intended for use with the game are actually cheat programs and automation programs (""bots"") that exploit Diablo III's mechanics and provide players with an unfair advantage. However, ""third-party software"" also refers to any file or program that attempts to:  * Obtain information about Diablo III that's not normally available to the player   * Transmit or modify the Diablo III game files   * **Provide access to features or abilities beyond what is allowed by the game's design**   * Change how Diablo III interacts with Battle.net In addition to undermining the spirit of fair play, this type of software can cause nasty technical problems, game-related bugs, and stability and performance issues with Battle.net. All of which can put a demon-sized damper on your gaming experience. As we've said in the past, playing Diablo III legitimately means playing with an unaltered game client. We strongly recommend that you avoid using anythird-party software which interacts with Diablo III—even if you are accessing that software from a reputable third-party site—as doing so can result in permanent ban from the game. For more information on all of this, you can check out a copy of the related policy for Diablo III over on our Customer Support site.  So just to make sure everyone is on the same page.. the third bullet:  &gt;**Provide access to features or abilities beyond what is allowed by the game design.**  Being that the game does not make this users keyboard perform the desired function normally, it violates this statue. I apologize if I came across as rude or snobby, that was not my intention.  edit: Found a cached version via my SSL proxy (in other words the links might not work).spelling and grammar.

Only thing missing for some is Photoshop and Adobe Suite, though Gimp is more than enough for most people.  We use it in a professional environment at work for web graphic design and it does the job fine.  As for iTunes... well, fuck that shit.  I can see from other comments that Android has been mentioned, and I can see your reservations...  My advice is to get an Android handset and never look back.  I've done iOS and Android, and there really is no contest now.  It used to be that Android lagged far behind as far as hardware went.  Now, Android shits all over even the latest iOS devices.  The OS is far better, with way more killer apps (SSH, etc).  Rooting my SGSII and putting on CyanogenMod increased the battery life dramitically (getting rid of all the bloatware).

t5_2qzb6,pinkandgreencaffeine,1353165460,"&gt;“Our problem with erosion was very serious and it was very damaging to the environment to the extent that, in these crops, to produce one ton of grain in Brazil, we lost 10 tons of soil per hectare per year.  We solved this problem by eliminating tillage,” says Almir Rebelo, grower advisor and president of Friends of the Earth, a Brazilian grower organization influential in the adoption of no-till farming in Brazil.  &gt;With conservation tillage, farmers leave the stubble or plant residue on the soil’s surface, rather than plowing or disking it into the soil.  The new crop is planted directly into this stubble, and genetically modified (GM) herbicide-tolerant plants make it possible and practical for growers to control weeds in the crop by applying an herbicide rather than plowing.    http://dmedia.ucsc.edu/~bsharris/film%20170a/proj3/monsanto/biotech-gmo/asp/topic5392.html?id=ConservationTillage  &gt;Roundup Ready® Crops Have Major Positive Impact on  Tillage Practices*  &gt;The benefits of conservation tillage systems in crop production including reduced  tillage and no-till are well documented. Reduced soil erosion, reduced labor and  fuel costs and conserving valuable soil moisture in drier climates are among the  many benefits experienced when growers shift from conventional tillage to  reduced tillage and no-till. University weed scientist have additional information  to show corn, soybean and cotton growers adopting Roundup Ready cropping  systems increase the use of conservation tillage practices.  Nearly 1200 growers in six states (approximately 200 per state) were surveyed by  telephone in the winter of  2005-2006.  A large  percentage of growers  transitioned from  conventional tillage to  conservation tillage  including no-till and  reduced tillage systems  after adopting Roundup  Ready crops in their crop  rotation (Figure 1).  http://btny.purdue.edu/weedscience/2009/GlyTillage09.pdf  &gt;In a study published in 1993, researchers at the University of Kentucky found that no-till methods decreased soil erosion by a whopping 98 percent. More recently, investigators at the University of Tennessee reported that no-till tobacco farming reduced soil erosion by more than 90 percent over conventional tobacco cultivation.   http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=a-case-for-no-till-farmin  &gt;“We had some erosion, but not nearly to the extent of conventionally-tilled farms,” said Caviness. “Due to the residue on the soil surface, raindrops absorb better and don’t have the explosive impact on the soil. The subsurface of the soil is also protected by the dead roots that hold everything together.”  &gt;Bednarek said that soil infiltration test results from Caviness’ farm indicate findings consistent with other no-till operations.  http://www.ia.nrcs.usda.gov/news/successstories/Caviness.html   Herbicide resistant crops make no-till a much more practical option and have resulted in a significant increase in no-till farming and reduction in conventional tilling since their release.",®

t5_2qlqh,3825,1353247002,"When the iTunes store began offering apps that used cellphone light to cure acne, federal investigators knew that hucksters had found a new spot in cyberspace.  “We realized this could be a medium for mischief,” said James Prunty, a Federal Trade Commission attorney who helped pursue the government’s only cases against health-app developers last year, shutting down two acne apps.  Since then, the Food and Drug Administration has been mired in a debate over how to oversee these high-tech products, and government officials have not pursued any other app developers for making medically dubious claims. Now, both the iTunes store and the Google Play store are riddled with health apps that experts say do not work and in some cases could even endanger people.  These apps offer quick fixes for everything from flabby abs to alcoholism, and they promise relief from pain, stress, stuttering and even ringing in the ears. Many of these apps do not follow established medical guidelines, and few have been tested through the sort of clinical research that is standard for less new-fangled treatments sold by other means, a probe by the New England Center for Investigative Reporting has found.  While some are free, thousands must be purchased, at prices ranging from 69 cents to $999. Nearly 247 million mobile phone users around the world are expected to download a health app in 2012, according to Research2Guidance, a global market research firm.  In an examination of 1,500 health apps that cost money and have been available since June 2011, the center found that more than one out of five claims to treat or cure medical problems. Of the 331 therapeutic apps, nearly 43 percent relied on cellphone sound for treatments. Another dozen used the light of the cellphone, and two others used phone vibrations. Scientists say none of these methods could possibly work for the conditions in question.  ‘Bogus’ claims  “Virtually any app that claims it will cure someone of a disease, condition or mental health condition is bogus,” says John Grohol, an expert in online health technology, pointing out that the vast majority of apps have not been scientifically tested. “Developers are just preying on people’s vulnerabilities.”  Satish Misra, a physician and the managing editor of the app review Web site iMedicalApps, adds: “They take some therapeutic method that is real — and in some cases experimental — and create a grossly simplified version of that therapy using the iPhone. Who knows? Maybe it works.” But until testing shows otherwise, “my feeling would be that it doesn’t.”  To be sure, there are many outstanding health apps, particularly those intended for doctors and hospitals, that are helping to revolutionize medical care, according to physicians and others. Among the most well-regarded apps for consumers: Lose It for weight loss, Azumio to measure heart rates, and iTriage to check symptoms and locate hospitals with the shortest emergency room wait times.  But consumers have almost no way of distinguishing great high-tech tools from what Prunty called the “snake oil.” Without government oversight or independent testing of apps, people mainly must rely on developers’ advertisements and anonymous online reviews, many of which are positive but some, such as this one, are not: “Shame on Apple for even allowing this piece of crap on here. . . . It preys on people with health issues.”  When contacted, Apple declined to discuss its apps or its app development process. The company’s lengthy guidelines for app developers say it will reject apps that crash, have bugs, do not perform as advertised or are sexually explicit. A Google spokeswoman also declined to discuss its apps or rules for developers. The company’s content guidelines say it bans sexually explicit material, gratuitous violence or anything that may damage users’ devices.  The FDA is drafting regulations that outline which types of health apps would need government approval before they can be marketed. But the regulations have been bogged down by debates, hearings and legislative back-and-forth over whether government oversight would stifle innovation. “Applying a complex regulatory framework could inhibit future growth and innovation in this promising market,” six Republican members of Congress wrote last spring to the heads of the FDA and Federal Communications Commission, reflecting some of the concern.  A few private groups, meanwhile, are working to assess the quality of various apps. Misra’s iMedicalApps gets health-care professionals to review software applications that mainly interest physicians. Happtique, a subsidiary of the Greater New York Hospital Association, is about to launch the nation’s first app certification service, which will evaluate apps for safety and effectiveness. It will award some apps the high-tech equivalent of the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval.  Smartphone stress test  Misra, an internal medicine resident at Johns Hopkins Hospital, says he’s most concerned about apps that claim to test or treat consumers for serious diseases. These apps can sometimes give inaccurate information or lull people into ignoring symptoms that might need medical attention.  Cardiac Stress Test, for instance, says on Google Play (where it sells for $3.07) that it can determine “if you are ready for sports or if your heart is not in a healthy condition.” A person performs 30 squats in less than a minute and then enters his heart rate into the app’s calculator, which reports whether the user is in shape for exercise.  “It’s hard not to imagine how this app could give folks a false sense of security,” Misra says, noting that assessing someone’s cardiac status is not just a matter of looking at his heart rate.  Simon Bertrand, who developed the app for his own use, said it is designed to help healthy people monitor their heart, similar to apps that monitor weight or body mass. “If you are in poor health condition,” he said in an e-mail, “go to see a doctor.”  Later, in an interview by phone from France, Bertrand said his app was available for sale on Google Play within minutes of his submitting it to the company. “It’s just a test. It’s not an application that claims to cure.”  Cellphone light as therapy  Apps that rely on cellphone light cannot possibly have any therapeutic value, experts say. While light treatments can be used to relieve some medical problems, cellphone light is in the wrong spectrum and far too weak to make any impact at all, said the FTC’s Prunty.  “Using the light of the cellphone is automatically suspect,” Prunty said, which is why the agency decided last year to file complaints against two developers who claimed cellphone light could cure acne.  The FTC argued in its complaints that the developers’ claims were “false or misleading.” AcneApp, which sold for $1.99 on iTunes, claimed that blue light fought bacteria and red light helped heal skin. “Rest the iPhone against your skin’s acne-prone areas for two minutes daily to improve skin health without prescription drugs,” it said. The app was downloaded 11,600 times, according to the FTC complaint.  A similar app for Android phones, Acne Pwner, was downloaded 3,300 times, the FTC said.  [...]  © The Washington Post Company",©

t5_2cneq,half_cocked,1353255066,"Nice. Great source of information from the Union that caused the company closure. I give you this, from Hostess:  ""Hostess Brands Inc. today announced that it is winding down operations and has filed a motion with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court seeking permission to close its business and sell its assets, including its iconic brands and facilities. Bakery operations have been suspended at all plants. Delivery of products will continue and Hostess Brands retail stores will remain open for several days in order to sell already-baked products.""  ""The Board of Directors authorized the wind down of Hostess Brands to preserve and maximize the value of the estate after one of the Company’s largest unions, the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers International Union (BCTGM), initiated a nationwide strike that crippled the Company’s ability to produce and deliver products at multiple facilities.""  ""On Nov. 12, Hostess Brands permanently closed three plants as a result of the work stoppage. On Nov. 14, the Company announced it would be forced to liquidate if sufficient employees did not return to work to restore normal operations by 5 p.m., EST p.m., Nov. 15. The Company determined on the night of Nov. 15 that an insufficient number of employees had returned to work to enable the restoration of normal operations.""  ""The BCTGM in September rejected a last, best and final offer from Hostess Brands designed to lower costs so that the Company could attract new financing and emerge from Chapter 11. Hostess Brands then received Court authority on Oct. 3 to unilaterally impose changes to the BCTGM’s collective bargaining agreements.""  ""Hostess Brands is unprofitable under its current cost structure, much of which is determined by union wages and pension costs. The offer to the BCTGM included wage, benefit and work rule concessions but also gave Hostess Brands’ 12 unions a 25 percent ownership stake in the company, representation on its Board of Directors and $100 million in reorganized Hostess Brands’ debt.""  “We deeply regret the necessity of today’s decision, but we do not have the financial resources to weather an extended nationwide strike,” said Gregory F. Rayburn, chief executive officer. “Hostess Brands will move promptly to lay off most of its 18,500-member workforce and focus on selling its assets to the highest bidders.”  ""In addition to dozens of baking and distribution facilities around the country, Hostess Brands will sell its popular brands, including Hostess®, Drakes® and Dolly Madison®, which make iconic cake products such as Twinkies®, CupCakes, Ding Dongs®, Ho Ho’s®, Sno Balls® and Donettes®. Bread brands to be sold include Wonder®, Nature’s Pride ®, Merita®, Home Pride®, Butternut®, and Beefsteak®, among others.""  ""The wind down means the closure of 33 bakeries, 565 distribution centers, approximately 5,500 delivery routes and 570 bakery outlet stores throughout the United States.""  ""The Company said its debtor-in-possession lenders have agreed to allow the Company to continue to have access to the $75 million financing facility put in place at the start of the bankruptcy cases to fund the sale and wind down process, subject to U.S. Bankruptcy Court approval.""  ""The Company’s motion asks the Court for authority to continue to pay employees whose services are required during the wind-down period.""  ""For employees whose jobs will be eliminated, additional information can be found at hostessbrands.info . The website also contains information for customers and vendors. Most employees who lose their jobs should be eligible for government-provided unemployment benefits.""  See, I can get my biased sources just as easily as you can. Listen, liberal. Just because you can copy and paste just like any other user on Reddit doesn't make you a scholar and expert in business and how it works.   The only fact that stands out and cannot be refuted is that if the striking employees returned to work on the day they were told to, they would still have jobs. It is a simple as that. They didn't and now we taxpayers have to foot the bill when 18,000+ workers sign up for unemployment benefits (which, by the way, we will have to pay for since the employer is no longer in business) and food stamps. So, congratulations, liberal. You won once again. 18,000+ new welfare cases for your ever expanding government hand-outs. Shit, what's the big deal in adding almost 18,000 new people to the food stamp programs already unsustainable 47,000,000 beneficiaries. Way to go.  But then again, what an I bitching about? More than half of the country voted for this shit.",®

There are four things Protoss can do off of two bases, besides getting a third.  Immortal-Sentry all in: Abduct solves a lot of this issue, without actually adding power to the Zerg army like the Infestor does. Vipers *feel* like weaker Infestors. They don't root. They allow for micro. They don't have any way of physically *harming* another unit.  Blink all-in: Blinding cloud the stalkers, force them to blink, blinding cloud them again and surround. Seems easy enough to warrant testing. Again, this puts micro in the hands of *both* the Zerg **and** the Protoss. Currently, until the late-game, Protoss is the only race with the *chance* to micro. ( Morrow summed up how Zergs feel in an article on this. )  Stargate: This is the most interesting to me as the Viper will actually make you *want* to make Hydralisks. It makes it so that the tech switch to Colossus from the Protoss isn't insta-death on the Zerg's part. This will, by far, be the most interesting aspect of this change.  Two Base Timing with Colossus: Again, something that becomes hold-able with Vipers. This actually makes it so that a Roach/Hydra Composition stands *a chance* versus Colossus. Both Zergs *and* the Protoss would be microing, instead of what currently happens---Zerg A-Clicks, grabs their Infestors, then tries to Micro those and leaves it up to the Protoss to worry about the rest. If Protoss lands the perfect forcefields, Zerg's dead. If Protoss miss-micros, they're dead.  Zealot Pressure on your Third ( I don't count this, so it's not part of my initial list. I've listed it for your sake, however. ♥ ): This isn't really much of a thing anymore. Sometimes it comes from a Warp Prism, something that can be abducted to be fought by Queens. Sometimes it comes from a pylon, at which point if you make Roaches---You hold easily off of three bases.    The Viper makes it so that Zerg micros, but it's abilities aren't as powerful as the Infestor. En-Masse, Infestors are always good. They give you free units and do damage. En-Masse, Vipers are considerably weaker. If you have no army to support them, I don't care *how many abduct's you land*: my units are just going to fight you from the inside out now. ",♥

t5_2cneq,highguy420,1353263545,"As a self-proclaimed ""vehemently pro-union"" person, and apparently someone who possesses the ability to clearly articulate yourself on the subject, I'd greatly appreciate your feedback on a topic I have been trying to fully grasp.  Recently I realized that, while I don't think anyone should ever be prevented from, or forced to join a union by law, unions are actually an ineffective stop-gap. An improper solution to the problem that distracts from the actual problem.  I base my new opinion on the simple fact that the unions cannot ultimately do the single thing they have promised their members. They do not own the company that provides the work, and therefore they cannot guarantee access to work. At any time, if the board of directors thinks they can make more money moving production to another country without unions, they can do that and the unions have no ability to stop it.   This realization actually opened up an entirely new perspective on corporate governance. I realized that the traditional corporate model is inherently flawed. It is simply unsustainable. Sure, in some cases you can have an altruistic CEO that values the company as their personal possession and sees money going to the company and workers as an investment in their own company, but that is rare in the modern day and age. Most of those types of companies are small and employ far too few people for unions to be a concern (Little Debbie may be one of those rare large exceptions). But for the most part we can clearly see a myriad of examples of corporate greed setting the overall tone for the industry.   The problem, as I see it, comes from the inherent conflict of interest in the board room. The board members are forced to decide if they want less profit or more profit at the expense of the workers. The only way to erase that conflict of interest is to conflate the concept of the worker and the board member. When every worker is a member of the board there is no conflict of interest.   When discussing this, many people have brought up the fact that you could lose control of the company, but nobody ""controls"" the company, so how could you lose something you don't have? Once the company is transferred to the workers the only outcome can be what the workers voted for. They can then decide if they want a larger paycheck, which is taxed and partially withheld for various state and federal programs, or they can choose to have a larger dividend check when the corporation pays out annually, taxed at corporate gains rates.   In the traditional ""I put the money in, I should get a return on my investment"" sense there are other business models that may work better for that. This is not something an investor would choose for themselves. This is something the workers either choose to create from the ground up to ensure a job for themselves and their coworkers, or something the workers choose for themselves in response to a corporate shutdown.   This also means that these companies are much more resilient. Sure, the workers could all decide that they would rather not work and only make a small paycheck each by hiring people in China to do the work for them, but without that profit being concentrated into the hands of a few people it's not generally large enough of an amount to be worth considering. The workers will choose to keep their high-paying job in a rewarding workplace. A handful of people can't shut the plant down against the wishes of the workers.   Now, unions have played various roles in history, however in the recent past they have been used by the corporations to pacify the workers while they gut our country of its wealth. That sounds hyperbolic, so let me clarify a bit. By wealth I mean our ability to produce. The factories that have been moved to China, Mexico, South America, India, Africa and other places with cheaper labor are our ability to produce more than we consume as a nation. Without the ability to produce goods and trade with the world we will go broke. Anyone with a checking account knows we can't spend more than we make for very long. That's what I mean by the wealth of our nation. I'm not talking about currency itself, but the ability to provide for ourselves as a country.   Furthermore, the unions were effective. Too effective. In the '70s we had the highest wages, highest per-capita income, and lowest corporate profit percentage in our recent history. The workers had demanded their fair share, and they were sharing in the wealth these companies were producing. The shareholders saw this as a problem, because they have traditionally been able to divert much more of the profits away from the workers into their own accounts. The only way to rectify this was to move the factories to countries where unionization and worker rights didn't exist. But to do so suddenly and drastically would leave the blame solely on their shoulders.  The unions played a crucial role in helping the companies slowly move their production overseas. By giving the workers the ability to slowly negotiate themselves out of a job they were able to point the blame at the unions themselves. They would shut down factories they already planned to shut down quietly, instead they would do it with much fanfare and the blame attributed to union actions (e.g. Hostess^® had planned to shutter factories months ago long before they could blame the strike). And their arguments were plausible. And people believed them, because they wanted an enemy, an antagonist in the story. Those greedy unions destroyed the company. Well, it was greed, but union greed is only a very small part of it. For the one finger the board members point at the union there are three pointing back at them from the same hand.  There were other factors as well, especially as the problem worsened. Walmart^® fits in later on in the game by gaining enough control of the market demand that they could help put pressure on the smaller companies who refused to offshore, convincing them to either move production to cheaper markets or liquidate their brand and assets to others who would do so (Huffy^® and Rubbermaid^® as two prominent examples). There are documentaries that cover this so I won't get into too much detail, but I will briefly explain that they were such a large customer for any brand that their production demand alone forced many companies to borrow money and build new infrastructure to service Walmart^® alone, then they would make threats to pull the products from their shelves, causing the company to either reduce the price they are charging Walmart^® (sometimes below their own cost of production) or walk away from their brand and/or principles. They used their control of market demand to force companies to move production offshore.   Instead of solving the problem, the unions were co-opted into being complicit in the slow and ultimate gutting of our production infrastructure. And they even took the blame for it too. For promising us access to work and a living wage they sure did gravely miss the mark. I'd characterize their performance as ""distracting us from the real problem while vying for increased control over the workers"". That sounds much like the same goals of the corporations. Maybe the lesson to learn is that concentrating power seems to cause an opportunity for corruption. Whether we are concentrating the productive output of hundreds or thousands (or millions) of workers in the hands of a few board members or concentrating the human productivity of hundreds or thousands (or millions) of workers in the hands of a few union representatives.  To reduce the concept to simplest terms we are fighting the exploitative concentration of power with another system that concentrates our collective power. Great, now we have not one but two bureaucracies vying for a slice of our productive output. The board must make a profit, and the union dues must be paid. And then we get some of what's left, hopefully. That or they outsource our jobs to countries with one less leech sucking from the profit stream. Why not remove both leeches and keep high-paying jobs in the country?  I have recently come to the conclusion that those who wish to actually protect their jobs must begin the process of buying the companies they work for. Buying the company from the board of directors, especially when they are already considering selling it off, can take a company that is profitable, but not profitable enough for the investors to keep it, into a company that thrives and provides jobs for hundreds or thousands of people. Sure, those investors put money and effort into starting the company, and they made their money back, now that it's ""only"" providing jobs for the workers the investors don't want to put time and effort into the company any longer, but the workers still have an incentive to maintain the company. In many cases the workers will also be in a better position to understand changing market factors and the best direction to take the company better than a board made up of investors whose only interest is making a profit from this, and all their other companies they sit on the board of.  Having had this profound realization as to the nature and inner workings of the modern corporate model I am compelled to find others to discuss it with. Even those who I consider open-minded and intelligent about the subject have strong reservations against it, arguing against logic and reason for the existing corporate model. The idea seems so foreign that ""there must be something wrong with it"". The way you describe things and the point you made about privately-owned corporations makes me think you are someone willing to consider this and capable of providing worthwhile and well-reasoned feedback.  As an interesting note, the only union I have found that aids in this process is the IWW. I have no opinion or experience with them, but I'm interested in your opinion on them as well.",®

Avro Lancaster B Mark I, NG128 'SR-B', of No. 101 Squadron RAF, piloted by Warrant Officer R B Tibbs, releases bundles of 'Window' over the target during a special daylight raid on Duisburg. Over 2,000 sorties were dispatched to the city during 14-15 October 1944, in order to to demonstrate Bomber Command's overwhelming superiority in German skies. Note the large aerials on top of the Lancaster's fuselage, indicating that the aricraft is carrying 'Airborne Cigar' (ABC), a jamming device which disrupted enemy radio telephone channels.  WINDOW was the code name for small metallised strips, like tin foil, designed to be dropped in bundles from RAF bombers. The result was a gently drifting cloud of metallic strips that created confusing signals on German radar screens and concealed the position of the actual bombers.   The British government had delayed the use of the top secret WINDOW. The fear was that as soon as the RAF used it, the Germans would find the metallised strips on the ground and take up the idea - using it on raids against Britain and disabling Britain’s own vital early warning radar. The British didn’t know that the Germans had already thought of the idea of WINDOW anyway - but had not used it for exactly the same reasons as the British.

The texas brothers shoudl be incredibly chuffed that their production was even close to those larger organizations.  Secondly, what are you complaining about when it comes to IPL?  What major tournament foibles have they committed?  MLG, hell yes.  Problems galore.    ""lol wut?

t5_2qjvn,brostep19,1353382900,"I like you. It's refreshing how aware and willing you are to examine. It seems rare, especially in females. If you communicate openly like this with him, it seems like it should be easy to resolve any issues between you. Unless it's just a relatability I'm experiencing, since your measured personality type is very similar to mine. What's his personality type?  I don't think you should shun your desires. You don't even seem to be asking for much at all. It feels good to make little gestures. It doesn't cost much, or require much effort. Its power is in the symbolic meaning, not matter; no mountain-moving required. It's just part of daily life together, where you form your own traditions and language of love.  Like if he wakes up in the morning still tired but has to get ready for work. You're still asleep, and he's just in his daily routine. He gets out of the shower, and is going through the motions, toweling dry, brushing teeth, and he goes to clear the fog off the mirror. But he thinks how you'll be up soon and will take a shower too. Then he sees the mirror, how you'll be standing here too, doing similar things, and he has an idea. He dips his finger into some soap, and draws you a little smiley face, with ""I ♥ U"". Then he goes about his business, and when the mirror dries it's not visible. But when you wake up, and are lost in your own thoughts, not paying attention because everything is out of muscle memory, you get out of the steamy shower, wrap towel around you, and awaken to a surprise as you see what he left for you, and your day is started with a smile.  That is so inexpensive physically. He didn't even have to walk a step out of his routine, yet it reminded you that he was thinking of you. That's all you want, to keep the love alive. Plants don't need to be watered every day, and they can go for stretches in the shade. But after too long, and they begin to wilt. It isn't expecting too much to have some rain and sunshine now and then. It replenishes the soil and provides what's needed to keep it going.  What about messages? Post-it notes are cute, but maybe those aren't around, and it's a waste of resources. But he must have a smartphone, right? Does he send you little things throughout the day? Does he share with you his thoughts and feelings, because he feels deeply connected and wants to express and share with you immediately? Does he ask about what you're doing? Does he send little presents, like cute pics, neat tidbits relevant to your interests, etc.?  When he's doing something for himself, does he do it for you too? Like if you both drink coffee, and have a machine to make it, when he's making one for him, does he do it for you too? Is there anything like that where he wants to share something new? Like, maybe you normally make coffee in the morning, and he doesn't drink it, but he knows you like it, so he's at work when he sees people enjoying this unusual flavor or recipe, and it totally looks like something you'd love, so he comes home excited and when you're all comfy and appear in the mood he whips it up with a sneaky smile, and serves to you this delicious treat, where your ""*mmm*"" gives him pleasure?  Does he derive pleasure from your pleasure? Is he thrilled to touch you, not because he's feeling the same sensual pleasures, but because it feels just as exciting to give you pleasure as it does to get? Does he want to pet you like a kitten, and make you tremble?  Is he creative?  Maybe it's partly his personality traits, but also his motivational system not being setup to feel rewards for the behaviors you want. Maybe it'd be possible to retrain some of that to feel pleasures from what gives you pleasures.  There could be lots of little ways you tax him and cause stress and frustration without being aware of how, or why. But you said you'd like to understand, so have you asked him? Can he identify it all and write out a list, so you can empathize with him? He might've tried to explain some things, but you not get it, so he just become angry. But can he write a report, where it's just a straight to the point outline? Maybe a big diagram, with both of you, then branches from each of you showing your inputs and outputs, then how those connect to each other. Then maybe he can calculate why there's not a balance where you're both replenishing each other, and what each of you specifically need to do.  It's funny because you said before something about wanting to play tennis sometimes, and that's like one of the least taxing sports ever. Even if you don't make it competitive, and just go out to try to see how many times you can keep the ball going back and forth. That sounds like fun, and it involves numbers, with scores. It'd also strengthen bonds, and be an activity of love.  It might be that marriage was primarily about organizing those in-and-out forces to form a system that actually produced something and had a chance of enduring long enough to maintain it for a while. The guys wanted the girls, and felt energy to single one out, then rush into her full speed. But then he's done, and is free to go.  Everything was codified though, to work with all those motivations, and keep it moving, like a locomotive steam engine. He has the fire, but it can't burn out so fast, because it's contained, and the oxygen choked to control its intensity. Then it's all channeled in ways that route the energy to move the vessel down the tracks.  Once that's gone, guys jerk off, kill some bad guys in a game, eat some snacks, and go to sleep. It's a fire burning with no utility. Not only that, but the fantasy of it all has allowed the desires to spread out in impossible directions where a lot of people can't even apply it in real life. It's a similar reason why some drugs are illegal.  But if we supposed that were just how life is today, and wanted females to get their fix too, then how could that be done? Typical male-rewards are easy to trigger, because there's little attachment required. You flash a picture of breasts, and the person need not even exist. It could be a computer graphical invention of a fictitious female, but the visual patterns trigger his senses, and he is aroused. He needs not know her name, speak to her, or even recognize she is sentient. All of that is irrelevant to his desires. She can be blind and deaf, which he never know, and still she serves as a sexy toy to reach the goal of climax.  But a female, while some have learned rewards in similar ways, typically need context. They can be aroused visually, and reach climax, but that's not the point. They feel those pleasures, but it's not the goal. Once they orgasm, they don't have that same sense of being done, like they beat the level, finished the game, got the ball in the final hole, and it's over. A guy, typically needs nothing else. His erection drops, and even touching the penis at that point can feel overly sensitive in a, ""Ow, go away!"" way, where just seconds before that same sensitivity was, ""Oh, MORE!""  So she cannot merely just masturbate to an image, or play a game filled with detached goals. She wants a story, a plot, a contextual involvement where there's sustained connection. She doesn't just want to collect the coins, she wants to know the character's name, and put the coins away in a treasure box, where they can be given to other characters with names, to write a story of life, love, and happiness.  That makes it inherently different, because he can wake up enough to watch some porn and masturbate, then it vanishes, with no trace. He didn't impregnate anyone, he doesn't know her name, he doesn't care at all about her and will probably never see her again. She's not anything but patterns of light. He's left with nothing but the residual effects, which are mostly a spent feeling of release where there is absence, and the resulting goo that came out his appendage.  How can you get the same? Your version likely requires knowing his name, having memory of him from before. Then your husband would be jealous and upset that you're having an emotional affair. Well, if he won't feed you love, then what are you supposed to do to have your needs fulfilled? He can masturbate to pictures of prostitutes, as a virtual version of stopping off at the brothel, but you sending love notes is cheating? It hardly seems fair, and just a technicality because his biological needs happen to not require context.   It's not really possible to have a female equivalent. If there were love-whore guys with websites, where they write romantic expressions, is that enough? Can you get attached to a guy you truly don't know? Can you visit a site, where you know his name, you read letters you feel could be addressed to you, he keeps you updated on his life, and you receive little text messages randomly every couple days, ""Papers are piling up, but I glimpsed a bird upon a branch outside the window, and lost in a daydream could only dream of you. Miss you. &lt;3""  But it's all porn? Where hundreds or thousands of women, in loveless marriages or isolated loneliness, get caught up in fictional fantasy? Do the husbands mind? Do they take it to be part of the new modern era, where marriage is formality, and porn is how we meet our needs? Do you both go to bed, he look at the girl he likes bent over in lingerie, and you read a love letter and see the pictures sent just to you, even though in reality both of you are 1 of many all looking at the same person? Why don't you both just roll over and look into each other's eyes, him being your love letter, and you being his slut?",♥

t5_2s5jo,Trees4twenty,1353438257,"here i just copied it from a rollitup site… too much to type. talking about pro-tek silica here. Ive used several that worked great.   The latest research proves that plants benefit in many important ways from supplemental soluble silicon. These benefits include greater tolerance of environmental stresses such as cold, heat, drought, salinity, mineral toxicity or deficiency, improved growth rates, accelerated root development on cuttings and improved resistance to insects and fungi. Soluble silicon promotes natural fungal defense mechanisms in plants, significantly reducing, and in many cases eliminating entirely, the need to use fungicides. Silicon deposited in epidermal cell walls enhances plants' resistance to small sucking insects. The resulting increased mechanical strength in epidermal cell walls enhances leaf presentation to light and improved stem strength. Soluble silicon enhances metabolic functions and plant growth rates by balancing nutrient uptake, distribution and transport and increasing chlorophyll concentration in leaves resulting in improved pollen fertility, fruit and flower count. Silicon deposition in the plant's epidermal cell layer acts as a barrier against penetration of fungal hyphae from powdery mildew, black spot, Pythium and Phytophthora, etc. Silicon is selectively transported to the site of fungal infection and is utilized by the plant metabolically to combat the growth of fungi. Silicon is also incorporated into cell walls improving heat, drought and cold tolerance by reducing transpiration. The added mechanical strength makes the plant less dependent upon osmotic pressure for leaf and stem turgidity. Silicon, selectively transported to the site of fungal infection, plays an active metabolic role in combating fungal growth by the production of polyphenolic compounds, part of a plant's natural defenses against fungi and insects. Silicon is rapidly bound in leaf tissue and deposited in a non-translocatable form within 24 hours of uptake. Therefore a continuous source of soluble silicon is very important to combat pathogens. This can be from constant feeding in hydroponics or from retention in the growing medium. In some plants, foliar applications appear to lead to even lower rates of disease. Silicon, taken up by the plant via the roots, is moved to old leaves first, whereas fungal infections tend to attack the new growth first. Foliar application to the new growth Pro-TeKts the tender new leaves. Foliar sprays of soluble silicon have also been shown to be effective for the control of aphids and other sucking insects on many plants. Epidermal cell walls containing silicon deposits act as a mechanical barrier to insects. In addition to the silicate deposits in the leaves, the intracellular content of silicic acid also acts as an effective sap sucking inhibitor for many insects. Discover the Benefits of Silicon Nutrition in Your Plants! Pro-TeKt ® “Silicon Increases Resistance to Pathogens In growth tests at the University of Florida dry weight in Dendrobium nobile, Aeschmea fasciata, Spathiphyllum and Anthurium scherzerianum provided 49 ppm soluble silicon increased from 18% to 80% over the dry weight of control plants grown without supplemental silicon. 32 of the 39 species evaluated in this test took up additional silicon when it was provided. Those plants are considered Si-responsive and had greater leaf thickness as well as greater dry weight. Silicon Increases Metabolic Rates and Stress Resistance Soil and Soilless Mixes: Apply Pro-TeKt® at a rate of 1:1500 to 1:3000 (1/2 tsp to 1/4 tsp/gal) depending upon the plants' requirements. Hydroponics: Continuously feed Pro-TeKt® at a rate of 1:750 (1 tsp/gal). Research has shown that silicon benefits plants in the following ways: improved resistance to wilt, resistance to water stress (heat and drought), enhanced leaf presentation resulting in improved light interception, enhanced reproductive growth, and increased tolerance of zinc deficiencies, cold temperatures, excessive phosphorus, manganese, sodium and aluminum concentrations. Silicon, deposited in the cell walls, forms a protective layer reducing transpiration through the outer cells. Silicon deposits in the cell walls of xylem vessels prevent compression of the vessels under conditions of high transpiration caused by drought or heat stress. Temperatures much above 90° F cause plants to virtually cease their metabolic functions because water is lost through transpiration faster than it can be replaced via the plant's root system. This results in harmful increases in intracellular mineral concentrations that inhibit plant functions. Increased levels of silicon in cell walls reduce transpiration loss caused by higher temperatures and the low humidity of typical interior growing conditions thus allowing continued metabolic functions at higher temperatures. Plants wilt less, resist sunburn and are generally more tolerant of heat stresses. Cuttings and plugs are more tolerant of the stresses encountered during root formation and potting up as a result of decreased transpiration. Studies at the Universities of Florida and Minnesota have shown significantly increased success rates in propagation of cuttings when silicon is applied foliarly through a misting system, or as a drench or soak prior to sticking. The surfactant characteristics of Pro-TeKt® result in better uptake of water and the minerals dissolved in it for better nutrition and growth. Silicon has also been shown to result in higher concentrations of chlorophyll per unit area of leaf tissue. This means that a plant is able to tolerate both lower and higher light levels by using more of the available light. Moreover, supplemental levels of soluble silicon have been shown to produce higher concentrations of the enzyme RUBP carboxylase in leaf tissue. This enzyme regulates the metabolism of carbon dioxide and enables the plant to make more efficient use of available levels of CO2. Silicon deficiencies often are indicated by malformation of young leaves and a failure of pollination and fruit formation in many cases. Plants with silicon added to the nutrient formula also show delayed leaf and flower senescence. The shelf life of cut flowers, specialty pot crops and plugs is also extended. Leaves are thicker and darker green compared to those grown without soluble silicon.   Here is a link that explains how it helps with certain micro nute uptake and lockouts http://www.fngla.org/reports/75/finalreport.pdf  Here is a quote from an article at Maximum Yield (one of my new favorite sites, see sig link),,,,,,,,,  Silica – the missing macro element  Silica is much more than a trace element in many plant species. In fact silica is considered to be a beneficial macro element for many crops with a wide range of benefits for hydroponic crop production. Several plants need silica for growth including rice, sugar cane and tomatoes. Silica is transported from the roots and travels up to the shoot in the xylem vessels and is deposited mainly as hydrated silica dioxide or as polysilicic acids. Once silica has been incorporated into plant issue in this form, it can’t be redistributed throughout the plant, so it needs to be in constant supply if the entire plant is to contain a useful amount. The use of soluble forms of silica as an additive in hydroponics is not new; many cucumber and rose growers are aware of the benefits of adding silica to the nutrient solution, whether it is in an organic or non organic form. Silica in cucumbers, for example, reduces the incidence and severity of powdery mildew and other fungi. Silica contributes to the strength and thickness of cell walls, helping to keep leaves in a good position for good light interception and to resist attacks by fungi and insects. Silica also assists with the absorption and translocation of several macro and micro nutrients and plays a role in allowing plants to survive and thrive in adverse growing conditions such as high salinity or excess elements in the solution or soil. Silica in solution should, however, not be considered a micro element; levels as high as 140 ppm have been shown to have the most significant results since silica is naturally found in many plant tissues at up to 10 per cent or higher (dry weight). In the past silica has been a difficult element to supply at high rates in hydroponic nutrient solutions. Chemical forms such as potassium metasilicate not only have a very high pH, but tend to form a glassy like substance, which blocks drippers and emitters when the enriched nutrient solution comes into contact with the air. These days more forms of silica are available on the hydroponic market and nutrient products and supplements containing silica as a macro element are readily available and easy to use.  ",®

That's cuz you're really really dumb.   &gt;Keynesian economists **believe** that in the short run, productive activity is influenced by aggregate demand (total spending in the economy) and that aggregate demand does not necessarily equal aggregate supply (the total productive capacity of the economy). Instead it is influenced by a host of factors and sometimes behaves erratically, affecting production, employment and inflation.[1]  &amp;  &gt;Austrian economist Friedrich Hayek criticized Keynesian economic policies for what he called their fundamentally ""collectivist"" approach, arguing that such theories encourage centralized planning, which leads to malinvestment of capital, which is the cause of business cycles. Hayek also argued that Keynes's study of the aggregate relations in an economy is fallacious, as recessions are caused by micro-economic factors. Hayek claimed that what starts as temporary governmental fixes usually become permanent and expanding government programs, which stifle the private sector and civil society.[29]  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keynesian_economics  ---     I can see you're a ""believer"" in that flawed system, and though both math and history are against you, you suspend disbelieving in facts to maintain belief in Keynes.   *Don't stop ""believing!

And `(\p.\q.p q p)` encodes “and.” Try this:      (\p.\q.p q p) (\x.\y.x) (\x.\y.x)  What did you get as output? The value for “true”? Now with `(\x.\y.y)` as one one the arguments?

And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church.   Ephesians 5:22-24  Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body. Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing.   1 Timothy 2:11-15  Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection.

Not entirely accurate either, according to [myfico.com](http://www.myfico.com/crediteducation/creditinquiries.aspx): *Looking for a mortgage, auto or student loan may cause multiple lenders to request your credit report, even though you are only looking for one loan. To compensate for this, the score ignores mortgage, auto, and student loan inquiries made in the 30 days prior to scoring. So, if you find a loan within 30 days, the inquiries won't affect your score while you're rate shopping. In addition, the score looks on your credit report for mortgage, auto, and student loan inquiries older than 30 days. If it finds some,* **it counts those inquiries that fall in a typical shopping period as just one inquiry when determining your score**. *For FICO scores calculated from older versions of the scoring formula, this shopping period is any 14 day span. For FICO scores calculated from the newest versions of the scoring formula, this shopping period is any 45 day span. Each lender chooses which version of the FICO scoring formula it wants the credit reporting agency to use to calculate your FICO score.*   In other words you are probably correct for all types of inquiries except mortgage, auto, and student loan inquiries.  For those mentioned categories your information is definitely not correct.  At least according to myfico.com.  However, they are kinda the authorities on FICO scores **since they invented them**: ""[myFICO® is the consumer division of Fair Isaac, the company that invented the FICO® credit risk score that lenders use.](http://www.myfico.com/Company/AboutUs.aspx)",®

t5_2ranw,farfigneugan,1353520282,"*Desiderata*    Go placidly amid the noise and haste, and remember what peace there may be in silence. As far as possible without surrender be on good terms with all persons. Speak your truth quietly and clearly; and listen to others, even the dull and ignorant; they too have their story. Avoid loud and aggressive persons, they are vexations to the spirit. If you compare yourself with others, you may become vain and bitter; for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.  Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans. Keep interested in your career, however humble; it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time. Exercise caution in your business affairs; for the world is full of trickery. But let this not blind you to what virtue there is; many persons strive for high ideals; and everywhere life is full of heroism.  Be yourself. Especially, do not feign affection. Neither be critical about love; for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment it is as perennial as the grass.  Take kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering the things of youth. Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune. But do not distress yourself with imaginings. Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness. Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself.  You are a child of the universe, no less than the trees and the stars; you have a right to be here. And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should.  Therefore be at peace with God, whatever you conceive Him to be, and whatever your labors and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life keep peace with your soul. With all its sham, drudgery and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful world. Be careful. Strive to be happy.  © Max Ehrmann 1927",©

t5_2qm4e,Mordisquitos,1353529010,"You must take into consideration some things.  First of all (and you might already know this), biological hazards come in [different levels](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biohazard#Levels_of_biohazard). The word ""biohazard"" and its symbol (☣) have both acquired a terrifying image in the popular imagination, and people generally associate them only with things that will kill you and everyone you know in a very graphic way. All they actually mean is: *""this presents a hazard which is (micro)biological in nature""*, whichever the level. For instance: the cold virus presents the hazard that you will feel under the weather and sneeze for a few days, lab strains of *E. coli* present the hazard that they just about might infect someone immunocompromised, and the Ebola virus presents the hazard that it will kill you and everyone you know in a very graphic way.   Secondly, biohazard risks are considered in a fundamentally different way from other hazards. Chemical and radiological hazards both have a tolerable exposure threshold for workers and the general population beneath which no damage is caused. As biological hazards are caused by microorganisms, which could theoretically (but probably not in practice) cause infection from a single unit, there is no tolerable exposure threshold.   With this in mind, when dealing with human tissue and blood samples from multiple origins, they are always considered hazardous by default in a laboratory or clinical environment. The people who work with blood and tissue samples might come into contact with many hundreds of different samples in a week. Of those samples, perhaps not a single one of them contains any blood-borne pathogens. However:  + If even one of the samples were to be positive for something as relatively benign as [Cytomegalovirus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_cytomegalovirus) that would already constitute a biological hazard to the worker (there is a small chance of a mononucleosis-like disease). + There is no acceptable exposure threshold to the possibly infected samples. + The worker will go through hundreds of these samples, which might even have something nastier.  So, what's the safest course of action? All blood and tissue samples are treated as biohazardous by default in a laboratory or clinical environment. It's simple risk management.  The fact is that the ""biohazard"" label is applied to blood and tissue samples basically because there is a small but significant _chance_ that there might be something in there that will cause disease (of any kind). Your own blood will obviously not be hazardous to yourself, and you can probably assume that neither will your sexual partner's if you already don't use protection. Also, for example, if a friend is bleeding to death, please don't be afraid to apply pressure to the wound just because it would mean coming into contact with something that would be labelled as ""biohazardous"" if it were in a lab. Blood may be yucky, but unless you know your bleeding friend has a really nasty disease the risk you are taking by helping him or her is minuscule.",☣

I have three and want so many more.  I love the soft light they give off.  I love police and prison things also.  I am a bit strange lol  •My latest impulse buy was: Hard to say---any time I go into walmart I am impulse buying 90% of the crap in my cart.  •I collect: bears (cute little figurines) and gnomes  Lastly...  •I'd want my Santa to know that...I think you are amazing.  Have a wonderful holiday season!  ",☹

I don't think that the creation of a hostile environment is a given, though I think they've identified that effect as probable. &gt;Plan B One-Step® is one pill that has a higher dose of levonorgestrel, a hormone found in many birth control pills that healthcare professionals have been prescribing for several decades. Plan B One-Step® works in a similar way to help prevent pregnancy from happening. It works mainly by stopping the release of an egg from the ovary. It is possible that Plan B One-Step® may also work by preventing fertilization of an egg (the uniting of the sperm with the egg) or by preventing attachment (implantation) to the uterus (womb)  ",®

t5_2qh33,kingofnynex,1353574235,"First of all, fuck you faggot.  Second:  Usage Note: For more than a hundred years, critics have remarked on the incoherency of using literally in a way that suggests the exact opposite of its primary sense of “in a manner that accords with the literal sense of the words.” In 1926, for example, H.W. Fowler cited the example “The 300,000 Unionists . . . will be literally thrown to the wolves.” The practice does not stem from a change in the meaning of literally itself—if it did, the word would long since have come to mean “virtually” or “figuratively”—but from a natural tendency to use the word as a general intensive meaning “without exaggeration,” as in They had literally no help from the government on the project, where no contrast with the figurative sense of the words is intended. This looser use of the word literally does not usually create problems, but it can lead to an inadvertently comic effect when the word is used together with an idiomatic expression that has its source in a frozen figure of speech, such as in I literally died laughing.

t5_2qq5e,hapea,1353615348,"My friend just posted this open letter from Oshan this morning, thought I'd share with you all. I really appreciated the love that Om Shan Tea spread and will be thinking of him on this Thanksgiving day.   Open Letter from Oshan in Jail  Dear Family, Friends and Allies, ... I am writing to let you know about my current situation. As many of you know, I have been fighting a legal case for two and a half year, accused of distributing psychedelics, with charges punishable by 10 years or more in federal prison. The weight of having this hanging over my head for years has been an agonizing experience, ca using extreme exhaustion , stress, and a deep depression. Despite this, I did the best I could to keep running my teahouse, my mobile tea services, teaching school kids about tea ceremony, hosting hundreds of spiritual dance, music and poetry events, throwing large intentional parties (Heartform, Tecompression) and striving to build community and contribute to the world as best I could. In the end I ran out of energy and my massive debts due to my legal fees caused me to close my teahouse down. I did this with great sadness and regret as poured so much money and years of my life into it. I hope that it had some lasting benefit to the bay are community and beyond. For more than 4 years, I haven't had more than 2 days break from my work and have longed for a vacation. I finally have it now, although tragically not on the beaches or in the forests as I had dreamed of.  Two and half years of fighting my case included a number of unsuccessful legal motions, relating to the impropriety of the DEA officers actions during my arrest and search. I believe these motions were denied due to a reactionary bias of the judge in my case also due to the outright lies and fabrications of the police officers. In July 2012 I underwent my first jury trial. Despite the fact that officers blatantly lied and contradicted each other while testifying and that dozens of government employees with unimaginable resources collaborated to try and convict me, multiple jurors decided that I was not guilty after hearing all the evidence against me. The prosecutors decided that they would waste more of our tax money by retrying my case at the end of October 2012. The trial proceeded like that last one, with officers lying and even admitting to lying during the previous trial. Sadly, after two days of deliberating, the jurors reached the verdict of guilty. I suspect that some of the jurors were pressured into coming to a decision so they would not have to come back after the weekend. After the verdict was announced, I immediately entered into custody and was transferred to Glen Dyer County Jail in downtown Oakland. I have been here for 10 days and will likely be here for another two and half months, after which I will be transferred into to a federal prison for a 10-15 year sentence.  Here at jail, I am confined to a 100 sq. ft cell more than 21 hours a day with my cellmate, who is a mexican gangster from the mission. In our cell is a bunk-bed, a small desk, and a toilet. There is also a small slit of a window which lets in minimal light, but has a cloudy film on it so I can't see out of it. The cell is so small that there is only one spot where I can stand in the middle and stretch out my arms in all directions without hitting a wall. The cell walls and floor are filthy and there is limited access to cleaning supplies. In our ""pod"" there is a TV on very loud everyday beginning around 8am and ending by 11pm at the earliest but some days until 2am or later. The TV is usually on a sports channel or sometimes a violent movie and I can always hear it blaring into my cell often making it difficult to sleep. We are let out of the cell 4 times a day for meals and ""pod time"". Breakfast is served around 6 am (although sometimes as early as 4 am) and lunch is served around 3:30 pm. The ""meals"" consist of the most disgusting and unhealthy food I have ever eaten in my life. I was raised eating organic, vegetarian food my whole life. I have many food allergies and the jail is supposed to accommodate my special diet but have failed despite numerous written and verbal requests, so I am forced to go without or eat food that violates my fundamental health and spiritual beliefs. We are only given about 5-10 minutes to eat these ""meals"" and then forced to go back in our cells. ""Dinner"" is delivered to out doors around 7pm and 90% of the time its baloney sandwich, an orange and two cookies.  ""Pod time"" consists of all 26 inmates in our pod being let into the 1000 sq ft communal space where we play inmates play chess, cards, socialize, watch TV and get in line for short phone calls or showers. Pod time happens twice a day for a total of 3 hours or less, in the morning from around 8-10 am and in the evening around 8-9 pm. These times are often shortened and occasionally canceled. All the schedules are constantly shifting so its hard to get into a routine. Due to the noise and schedule its hard to get more than 4 hours of solid sleep. There are minimal educational and religious activities and most have a long wait list that takes a month or more. State law mandates that inmates get 3 hours/week of outdoor ""yard time"" but inmates here tell me they have had about 1 hour of yard time in the past 6 weeks! Indeed the jail violates many of its own operating procedures as well as state and federal regulations and probably international human rights codes.  I cry almost every day that I am here, although I am careful not to do it around other inmates. I miss all my family and friends. I miss being able to hug and cuddle with friends. I long to eat healthy food, breather fresh air, see the sun and the sky, be in nature and be able to move freely and get proper exercise. I pray everyday for a miraculous release but I don't see how its possible. I am using this experience as an oppurtunity to grow and learn as much as I can. I am doing lots of reading, writing lots of letters and doing calisthenics and yoga as much as I can in this cramped cell. I am cultivating a strong spiritual practice of meditation and prayer.  On January 17th, 2013 I will be sentenced to 10-15 years in federal prison. It would be great to see all my friends there, so mark your calendars if you can come. It would be great to have good character reference letters to present to my judge. My lawyer said that quality is much more important than quantity, so its best if they are from people that actually know me and especially good if they are from people who would be considered respectable by my conservative judge. The deadline for these is december 8th. Send them to Aaronzenstevens@gmail.com.  After sentencing it will take 5-30 days for me to be transferred to prison probably in Oregon or southern California. Prison is much better than jail and there are a lot more activities, free movement and outdoor time. I am trying to see it as an extended meditation retreat. Even though I have so many friends out there, I have a fear that I will be forgotten about, lost in the prison system.  Due to the fundamental flaws in my case, I will be attempting multiple appeals in the higher court. This will cost a lot more money, so my family and friends well be continuing to raise funds and they could use any assistance anyone could offer. If you have any media or journalism connections who might want to cover my story, please get in touch. Thank you for the tremendous amount of support and prayers, donations, and moral support I have received so far. It really touches my heart and makes this whole nightmare bearable. I urge everyone to do what they can to educate themselves and other about the cruel and corrupt criminal justice system, the horrors of the drug war and the prison industry. There is information on various organizations you can work with on TeaNotPrison.com. I also encourage people to explore concepts of judgement and punishment in our society.  Much Love and Gratitude! For The Benefit of All Human Beings, Oshan Anand ♥",♥

Fireworks is specifically made for pixel based designs to be displayed on a screen, especially web design and it allows you to effortlessly align things to be pixel perfect. It is also much more intuitive and easy to use than Photoshop when we're talking about web design and if give it a shot for a few days, I'd bet you can do pretty much everything you'd need to for a mock-up or full-blown design in half the time as in Photoshop and far more accurately.   It's kind of funny that many web designers have Fireworks in their toolbox because it came with their Adobe Creative Suite, but they never touch it because they're so used to Photoshop which is just an extremely bloated tool for web and interface design. I'll leave you with what adobe themselves say about each product:  &gt; Adobe® Fireworks® CS6 software helps you create beautiful designs for websites and mobile apps in a snap, without coding. Deliver vector and bitmap images, mockups, 3D graphics, and interactive content for popular tablets and smartphones.   &gt;The Adobe® Photoshop® family of products is the ultimate playground for bringing out the best in your digital images, transforming them into anything you can imagine, and showcasing them in extraordinary ways.",®

Truly *bigoted* hate speech, on the other hand, should absolutely be downvoted, reported, and removed.  The way I see it, altrocks' argument is that religion spreads by a language of superiority and exceptionalism, and as such atheism should be justified in doing the same. I vehemently disagree on both points, but I think it's an ignorant argument, not a bigoted one.  Perhaps I'm wrong, but I don't think they should be downvoted to -60 with hardly anyone attempting to debate it properly.  That's all.  And of course we cool.

Look for deals on processor and mobo combos. Building a computer is easy if you do the research BEFORE you start buying stuff. Make a list and run it by a subreddit or even newegg or microcenter if you have one nearby (I would greatly suggest microcenter, I bought everything from them and their prices are almost always the same as newegg so the benefit of having what I bought in my hands is nice).",😋

t5_2su3h,lockeslylcrit,1353808623,"Not to mention that the economic model is such that you can be a dick in the game without actually going to war. An example would be one of my last games, where I played China. I REALLY didn't like Russia encroaching on my borders, so I waited for the current Great War (which they were in) to end. Russia lost and had to capitulate, which dropped them out of Great Power status. So what did I do then?   I gave them some free factories using foreign investment.  Not just any factories. Oh no. I gave them Canned Food factories. One of the worst you can build. And I didn't build one or two, I built them in ALL their regions. The resulting influx of canned food in the world market and the number of people moving from their farms and mines to man the worthless factories meant that within a few years Russia was completely and utterly bankrupt.  And then I gave them more canned food factories.  *Canned Food: For when you absolutely, positively hate someone.*®",®

t5_2qnvz,NeoDestiny,1353871152,"&gt;Yes, they do. Moreover, sometimes developers release new drivers specifically for a new game, because it just doesn't work with previous drivers.  Haven't seen any patch notes or anything recently from Nvidia or anything else about it. I've had driver problems before in games and generally it leads to really shitty performance or things not rendering correctly. Never in my life will it just ""crash"" in the loading screen.  &gt;Only 6-7 months? Yeah, should be ok, lol.  You think drivers are released every week for graphics cards? It's like 1-2 months between version updates.  &gt;If it can be done with the CPU, it doesn't mean that you don't need the sofware for it, mang.  I need to update my graphics card drivers...for the software...to do physics calculations on my CPU...? wut?  And again, not related to crashing problems.  &gt;I don't think that, I know it.  Did you even read what you linked? Most of those were people who had already loaded a game and who were having conflicts with other programs on their boxes.  You seriously just sit and stare at your apps loading because you're too scared to alt tab out? Jesus, it feels like 2000 all over again.  &gt;I'm just trying to help, dude.

Thanks ♡♡♡ Slumgullion seems to be exactly the word I've been missing, to put a name for all reality weirding going on in this game some crazy people denote ""reality""❢  -----  PS. Sorry, I misunderstood the word slumgullion, the site as such seem to be part of that weirding module. What I had read was the brief [from a search](http://www.bing.com/search?q=slumgullion)  *Slumgullion things...too good to take down and have disappear!*  That was what I thought slumgullion meant, as most good things have disappeared, and most good things are cancelled, and most good things are fighted by some maffia controlling the US marionette government which then spreads their viral ideas over the globe, thus infecting it.  However, also good things come from US, like Richard Stallman and Free Software Foundation, and Internet, despite it's a DARPA invention, and Richard Feynmann, Wikipedia, Michael Jackson, Multics, Unix, Foresight Institute, MIT free educational program etc.  PPS. maybe I should mention also software patents, as without this damned crazy US invention, then I would probably not have come up with the idea to the patent killing patent, which I got during a debate with a software patent freak, Gregory Aharonian, a patent buster, in San Francisco 2000.

t5_2qzzs,Butthole_Scientist,1353935442,"I know that.   Your body makes all of the sodium bicarbonate it needs just from burning sugar. The end product of metabolising carbohydrates is basically CO2 + H20. CO2  and H2O is converted to H2Co3, which dissasociates to H+ and HCO3, Bicarbonate.  (CO2 + H2O ↔ H2CO3 ↔ H+ + HCO3)  Eating sodium bicarbonate in small amounts has no effect on overall blood pH because your body wants to maintain homeostasis, so it secretes more HCl to balance out the base that you added.  If you were to take enough sodium bicarb to make a difference in blood pH readings, then you are going to likely die from metabolic alkalosis.   I'm a paramedic. I know what I'm talking about.",↔

Neither, actually. The word 'LEGO', when used as a noun, should only refer to the company that makes the product. Otherwise 'LEGO' is supposed to be used as an adjective. Thus, when referring to the pieces, neither 'lego' nor 'legos' is correct... rather one should say: 'LEGO bricks' or 'LEGO pieces' or whatever (using LEGO as an adjective -- and one should really capitalize all of the letters, and put the little 'circle-R' symbol after it (®)).

This is Aristotle's brief definition from my Encyclopedia:    *Aristotle described politics as a society's common strive towards ""a good life"" and solve conflicts between the common good and special interests.*  Here some more elaborate, although more fuzzy definition. It would be enough with [Aristoteles defintion](http://www1.union.edu/wareht/gkcultur/guide/18/aristotle.html).  *Politics as defined by Aristotle himself is a ""practical science"" because it deals with making citizens happy. His philosophy is to find the supreme purpose of life, virtue as he puts it. One of the most important roles of a politician, though, is to make laws, or constitutions. With this task I believe that Aristotle wanted the citizens well being and livelihood to be contemplated before any laws were made permanent. After the laws are put into place the politician's job is to make sure that that they are abided by. Aristotle believes that with the same constitution citizens will be the same over time, but if the constitution is ever changed so will the citizen.*  --------------------  Unfortunately politics today is some obscure art in lying, deceiving, exercise  power and earn a lot without doing anything meaningful.... :(  Nothing that I would never ever my kids to learn, fortunately they didn't❣  They are both very nice, helpful honest persons (29 and 32 years).",❣

t5_2qh13,fairwellIMJA,1353977914,"&gt;like it's a guarantee.    Don't tell anybody, but...    The real number is ""35%"" were intercepted. http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2012/11/19/israel-has-not-yet-faced-true-missile-test Let's also keep in mind that an Iron dome battery has at most 16 missiles.   Russia is cool, but Iran has effectively become Russian interests protector in the middle east. (Anti- petrodollar) And Iran has pursued one primary method of self defense for the past 30 years, the guided missile. (goggle ""iran missile superpower"".) And this is a nice vid &amp; story of how the US Navy is defenseless, and Iran turned a Chinese ""Volkswagen"" missile into an Iranian  ""Porsche"" supper-missile:   ""An interview with Joe Trento about C-802 missiles and what they mean for the Persian Gulf"". http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=kuFitD8ZbWA [11:56] &amp; http://www.dcbureau.org/category/national-security-news-service/page/7   Please read this:  &gt;The rocket-nozzle control system allows the missile to change its trajectory several times during re-entry and even terminal phase, effectively preventing interceptor guidance via trajectory prediction by early warning radar - a method nearly all long range ABM systems use. As a high-speed ballistic missile and pre-mission fueling capability, the Shahab-3 has an extremely short launch/impact time ratio. This means that the INS/gyroscope guidance would also remain relatively accurate until impact (important, given the fact that the gyroscopes tend to lose accuracy with longer flights). The CEP is estimated to be at 30–50 metres (98–160 ft) or less   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shahab-3   &amp;  See [this pic](http://defense-update.com/Images_new3/noor_c802.jpg)  of an ordinary small delivery truck (6 wheeler) launching an Iranian weapon (Range: 360 km) that would immediately cause Israel to beg for mercy if aimed at any one of these 6 places http://www.digitaljournal.com/img/4/9/8/8/0/7/i/7/8/9/o/Israels_known_nuclear_sites.JPG  When Iran decides to arm Hamas... You'll know! ---    Remember that drone that flew over Israel for three hours and was only discovered when it was over Demona???  ... and when the US drone crossed into Iranian airspace, the Iranians were on it like stink on shit?   See:   &gt;Iranian passive radar. Passive radars do not transmit waves and instead, detect and track objects by processing reflections from non-cooperative sources of illumination in the environment, such as commercial broadcast and communications signals.       &gt;Alim **is cheaper** and has less maintenance cost than normal radars because it doesn't have transmitter and movable mechanical parts. Although it needs high processing power because it has to do six levels of processing to track a target. Other advantages include the ability to detect low RCS (""stealth"") targets in low altitudes. Also as it doesn't transmit anything, it is not possible to destroy it using anti radiation missiles such as American AGM-88 HARM thus it can be deployed near the enemy lines.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alim_radar_system   Israel can drop every Nuke they own on Iran, and Iran will still survive, however, Israel will not... *(And Israel knows it, otherwise they would have attacked already.)*    PS: Just ask and I'll tell you how *(it's possible)* Iran will make the first wave of Missiles sent against it, hit US bases and Saudi royal family locations instead! *([the same way it took down that drone](http://www.ne.anl.gov/capabilities/vat/spoof.html), but on missiles to bring them all the way to Riyadh!)* ☺   ",☺

It's got great gunplay, a decent story, and the ancient GeoMod engine it uses has held up pretty well.  Recommended.  [Red Faction II](http://store.steampowered.com/app/20550/), OTOH, is a completely consolized piece of SHIT that made me want to smash an X-Box.

Most of the art assets are very good, and the voice acting is okay.  The problems are the hokey level design, over-reliance on rail shooter sequences, laughably bad character models, and a complete lack of a real savegame system.  While the first Red Faction is a true classic PC FPS, the sequel lives up to every insult that PC gamers like to hurl at console shooters.

t5_2qhk3,BioGenx2b,1354028691,"    Men need feminism.     Feminism is for everyone.  or      Women need Men's Rights.     Men's Rights is for everyone.  __________________ Both of the above statements are fine and indeed true. As for the images you linked...  1. Though I can see that the concept of patriarchy in Western society can be easily assumed, it should be scrutinized heavily. It certainly does exist in certain subcultures here in the West, but it absolutely exists as a state-sponsored institution in many parts of the world, and in that context it makes perfect sense.   As for the last statement, I see absolutely nothing wrong with that. Our history of patriarchy prior to the feminist movement's victories continued the trend of male disposability, something of which our culture is still feeling the effects.  2. `This is sarcasm.` How could you not see that? Maybe you missed the thread from a couple of weeks ago.  3. (*Feminism* **↔ Men's Rights**) is not only for (*women* **↔ men**), but also for (*men* **↔ women**) with (*female* **↔ male**) siblings, parents, children, cousins, and friends.  4. Aside from the assertion of present-day Western patriarchy, the entry spends its time giving credit to feminism for its role in combating traditional gender roles, something for which we all suffer, men and women alike.  5. ""There are certainly women calling themselves feminists who believe that women should be elevated to a higher social level than men, however; this is hardly the case with the majority of feminists.""   _________________   ""Thinking of feminism within the context of eliminating the gender binary opens up a whole new set of solutions to feminist problems. For example, the professional math world is overwhelmingly male dominated. Instead of ensuring that 50% of people hired in mathematics are women, we can instead work to eliminate the prejudice that women are inferior at math than men that starts as early as elementary school. It is more important to judge a person’s skills by a person-to-person basis. Gender should not be a factor when hiring for a job in any field. Equality means equal opportunity, not monotony.""  6. `(Duplicate of 5.) `  Seriously though, did you even read these articles? You're definitely straw manning this. Your arguments don't even match up with your supporting evidence. In fact, all you've done was support what I've been saying. *Unless that was your whole plan all along...?*  `You sly bastard.`",↔

A current route is denied the network operators. By Daniel Bakir Netzentwicklungsplan, Stromtrassen, Stromleitungen, Stromautobahn, Energiewende  &gt;2800 km additional lines: three new electricity highways to transport energy from the north to the south.  &gt;© Philip Moeller / stern.de Send Print Google-Anzeige Nexus 7 from Google Thin, light, and more portable with mobile data. Shop now from $199. play.google.com  &gt;A n wind is not lacking in the German coast. And wind turbines are in the far north, more than some is right. What is missing are the lines that carry the electricity generated in the south. At this site, the federal government has now taken a step. The Federal Network Agency on Monday handed Economy Minister Philipp Rösler (FDP), the final network development plan - the national master plan for the expansion of power lines. Anzeige  &gt;Central are mainly the three planned high-voltage direct current transmission lines (HVDC). You have to transport large quantities of electricity over hundreds of kilometers from north to south, which is why they are also called power highways. The western route is from the North of the Ruhr to the Rhine-Main area. The average north-south connection begins and ends in the Hamburg area east of Stuttgart. The third line links Thuringia and Bavaria. The originally planned fourth current highway from near Bielefeld in the greater Frankfurt area will initially not be built. 1000 km less than planned  &gt;Overall, in the next ten years, new energy highways are created with a length of 2800 kilometers. This is around 1000 km less than originally planned. In addition, only 2800 km further - instead of originally planned 4400 km - reinforced the existing high voltage grid. Of the 74 individual measures that network operators had suggested confirmed the network provider only 51st The cost is estimated at 20 billion euros. Economy Minister Philipp Rösler called it a ""milestone in the transformation of energy supply.""  &gt;The network development plan is the result of a complex process, which was launched in the summer of last year and also affected citizens and citizens' groups acknowledged the opportunity to have their say. A first draft of the transmission system operators had submitted in August. In its review of 3300 submissions were incorporated, the president of the network provider, Jochen Homann. Most were submitted by citizens. What's next?  &gt;Now the ball is in the Federal Ministry of Economics, which has cast the plan into law. Federal law required the necessary plan to be adopted in December by the Cabinet, the parliamentary process can begin. With the law will define the start and end points of the future high-voltage lines. Only then is the route corridors are defined. That's up to a thousand meters wide strip where the wires are to be later. Extend the electricity highways by several states, the responsibility lies with the future of the network provider. The goal is to shorten the usual procedure for such major projects duration of ten years and more clearly. ",©

t5_2rgjh,ImginationExpress,1354036485,"I think your comment is well thought out and you make a lot of interesting points. But you make a lot of assumptions that are untrue. I think everyone can improve on something and that's part of the reason I posted, and I ended up getting suggestions that I do take to heart and will work on.  It was never my intention to make others feel worse about themselves, god knows how many people did that to me growing up.   I'm not here for compliments. The thing is, I spent years growing up in middle school and high school as a really really unattractive kid and got picked on for it constantly. Most kids looked forward to Saturday and Sunday to sleep in; I saw them as respites from the dirty looks and teasing. Because of that my own view is often distorted. I literally have no idea if I am attractive. You see, the braces came off, I got contacts, seriously changed how I dressed and put a little effort into my hair and face, but that ugly kid greets me every time I look in a mirror.   There's a saying to be content, but never satisfied and I try to follow that. There's nothing wrong with self improvement. And good god, if I had placed all my value in my looks all those years I was bullied, I don't think I would have made it. Instead, I poured myself into studying and working my ass off to make sure that I wouldn't  have to rely on looks to get by because back then that was the furthest thing from an option that I had.  And these jobs are just part time until I finish school 😊. ",😊

t5_2rl8h,theguildhallcompound,1354039751,"Hello everyone out there in the LARP world.  My friends and I have created a web show called ""@The Guildhall Compound.""  This is the third episode of our show. The web show is based of the New Jersey LARP called Mystic Realms.  Mystic Realms® is a theatric arts organization. Our program combines traditional theatric skills with live-action roleplaying to create an interactive theatric experience where the participant is both the actor and the audience.  We are always looking for new players, so if you are interested, simply go to the MR website at www.mysticrealms.com or go to their Facebook page http://www.facebook.com/MysticRealmsAdventures.  Feel free to subscribe to our web show at YouTube as well as like us on Facebook. http://www.facebook.com/pages/-The-Guildhall-Compound/168690089933468  I would also like to take this moment and say that any Mr players who use this thread to bash or say harsh comments about other NJ LARPs or any other LARPs will be discovered and severely punished.  We are not about bashing, we are about having fun and enjoying a NJ LARP.  Thank you and we'll see you, on the trails",®

Any area that is painted or coated in any other way wouldn't be affected.  They do sell a separate ""Extreme Simple Green"" product that they rate as safe for aluminum.  From their website:  &gt;contact times for unprotected or unpainted aluminum surfaces should be kept as brief as the job will allow - never for more than 10 minutes. Large cleaning jobs should be conducted in smaller-area stages to achieve lower contact time. Rinsing after cleaning should always be extremely thorough - paying special attention to flush out cracks and crevices to remove all Simple Green® product residues. Unfinished, uncoated or unpainted aluminum cleaned with Simple Green products should receive some sort of protectant after cleaning to prevent oxidation.  ",®

t5_2sjmv,lobsterbreakfast,1354099624,"A lot of the comments here are pretty balanced and it's keeping my hopes up for the Vita, but I will tell you a sad sad tale.  Many, many years ago, Sega produced an awesome console called the Dreamcast®.  Not only was it innovative with 56k ports to put it online accompanied with an internet gaming lobby, but it also had a lot of pretty decent titles, and some AWESOME ones including Skies of Arcadia, which is still underrated to this day.    The Dreamcast® had decent sales at first, but dropped off due to competition from the PS2.  Its problems were further compounded by expensive additional hardware (*cough* memory card *cough*), as well as lack of third-party support because the big developers realized there was money to be made elsewhere.  Eventually, only after a shelf-life of about 2 years, a debt-ridden Sega stopped manufacturing Dreamcast® and all was lost.    **TL;DR  SONY LEARN YOUR LESSON FROM THE DREAMCAST. ILY**  edit: just realized how ironic this was",®

There is a work around for this though, the first thing you will need to do is go to the Settings menu. - Select Display Settings - Select Video Output Settings - Check only 480p and 1080p This should force the game to display in it's expected resolution Keep in mind that if you are going to play a game that is displayed in a lower resolution you will need to readjust the previous settings. For the refresh rate, you can turn off BD 1080p 24 hz Output (HDMI), this will be located under the Settings menu as well. - Select Video Settings - Select BD 1080p 24 hz Output (HDMI) - Select Off You may also want to contact the manufacturer of the TV to see if there are any firmware updates, if it can support 240 Hz refresh rates at 720p, or if it's only in the higher resolutions",®

A few things that I can see: is there a reason why you went for Windows 7 Professional? Windows 7 Home Premium is cheaper, and most people won't use the extra features in home professional.  You probably don't need the bracket for the drive bay, SSD's are small and most of the times you can find a place to velcro it to, saving you space.

t5_2qhb9,rmc,1354204516,"&gt; Ask feminists.  I'm a feminist! ☺   My point was that lots of people might call a thing ""rape"", but the law might call it a different crime. Like a ""murder"" / ""manslaughter"" difference. A certain act might be illegal, and might not count as ""rape"", but many people might informally call it ""rape"". So do we mean the social defintion of rape or the legal one? What about when someone posts ""im gay"" on your Facebook wall? Does that count?  For example [Section 3 of the 1990 act](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1990/en/act/pub/0032/print.html#sec3) defines the crime of ""aggrevated sexual assault"" as ""means **a sexual assault that involves** serious violence or the threat of serious violence **or is such as to cause** injury, humiliation or **degradation of a grave nature to the person assaulted**."" (emphasis mine). So a woman doing a man in the ass with a strap on (for example), would (I presume) count as an indecent assault that would cause humilitation or grave degradation. That's punishable by up to life imprisonment and is a felony.  &gt; Agree. But as far as I can tell it's only changed to add some extra legalese and give children even more specific rights.  It adds extra crimes, so a man could analy rape another man under the 1990 law, but not under the 1981 law (mind you all anal sex / sodomy was technically illegal in 1981).",☺

t5_2qhb9,rmc,1354205871,"Yes that appears to be the case. ☹ That should be changed, to legally refer to that as rape. Words matter.  However, if a woman held down a man, it would (as I said) almost certainly be illegal, with life imprisonment as the maximum sentance. Not ""rape"" in the legal sense, but a serious crime.  After all, if a man held a woman down and fisted/fingered her ass and made her suck his fingers/a dildo/a gun, forced her to strip and fondled her all over the place, and got his buddy around to take photos of her naked that that wouldn't count as rape either.

t5_2sokh,JakeDeLaPlaya,1354270802,"&gt;surely its more potent in the Bear spray because it's made for fucking bears?  Actually its not. If it says that, its because of marketing.  Bear spray is often the same thing as regular pepper spray but in a different package and a fogging nozzle instead of a stream.  It may also include some additional stickiness to defeat the bears oily fur.    &gt;Currently the EPA requires that the concentration of Capsaicin and related capsaicinoids range between 1 and 2.0%. The variance in potency within this range is negligible, and all will affect the eyes, nose, throat and lungs of a bear. The minimum size can the EPA will register currently is 7.9 ounces, or 225 grams. [source](http://www.centerforwildlifeinformation.org/BeBearAware/BearSpray/bearspray.html)    And here's an advertisement from Mace Pepper spray:  &gt;TAKE DOWN EXTREME® PEPPER GEL® is our strongest pepper spray, a 1.4% capsaicinoids concentration  As you can see, the capsaicinoids concentration is in the same i range in both the bear spray and people spray.   Incidentally, its all made from hot peppers and the heat of the pepper used is the most important thing. Sometimes they use a lot of tabasco peppers or a few habaneros but there's an equal amount of heat in both formulations. They'll even advertise the one using tabasco is hotter since it technically has more OC. However it has fewer capsaicinoids.   Scolville Heat Units (SHU) are actually the best measure of pepper spray heat.    &gt; why people actually have died from asphyxiating because of it.   If they died after being sprayed with OC, its because they most likely weren't generally healthy.  Someone with severe asthma and no inhaler may be in risk of asphyxiation.   Edit: death portion.

""gross negligence n. carelessness in reckless disregard for the safety or lives of others, which is so great it appears to be a conscious violation of other people's rights to safety.

t5_2r373,Bleak_Morn,1354307869,"I grew up in SoDelCo too. The housing developments sprang up in farm fields - leaving a nice view of surrounding farm fields.  Then, due to the development that farm land became valuable retail space and the home owners started complaining about the development of land they didn't own. 🎻  My grandfather lived in the North Linden area and growing up Dad told me stories of riding his bike on I-71 while it was under construction, and how the teachers gave up on teaching kids as workers moved houses down the street in front of the school building (the houses were relocated to make room for the freeway).  When Dad was learning to drive, the only building on Morse Road was that fortune teller place (it's still there) - everything else was farm fields.  When I was learning to drive Polaris Parkway was a freshly paved two-lane road and the BP near the freeway ramp was the only structure.  Oh, and get this, The Ohio State University Campus used to be ""way out in the country"" when my great grandfather went to school there (around the time the stadium was built). :D",🎻
