t5_2qh1i,ForCripeSake,1343791522,"So look, in 6th grade, I started jackin' it. We just had sex ed (Catholic sex ed), and I was like ""okay, that sounds kinda fun besides the don't do it, it's evil part"". They say that it takes 10,000 hours to become a virtuoso at an instrument, so needless to say I was pretty much the Victor Wooten of beating off by 7th grade.  At this time, generally speaking, there was pussy on the brain for all of the junior high boys. One of our friends had a screaming fast 28.8kbps connection to AOL and was looking at tits. We all gathered round and started giggling (literally) at this busty new world of boobage splayed before us. Jokes were had, merriment was made, and I said something along the lines of ""hah, I'll be saving this for later.""  Blank stares. Needle scratches the record.  Friend: ""Saving it for what?"" Me: ""Spank bank!""  Friend: ""What's that?"" ""Me: (proudly) Totally gonna jerk off to this later."" Friends: ...  (Tumbleweed rolls) Oh... shit..  The next day at school, I was a fucking leper. A jizzy, lanky, half-pubescent leper. The eyes, the eyes! Reddit...I'll never forget them.   The girls looked at me distrustfully, like I was this lawn sprinkler of cum spurting in a haphazard 270 degree arc on a lawn of dead flowers. The boys were not amused, how dare I touch my own penis, that's gay. My gossip-ass-snitches-get-stitches-bitch-friends told EVERYONE.   So on it went, fucking D.K. barrel'd down the grade school social ladder. I honestly wanted to transfer schools. There was no possible way I could live this down. I was The Masturbator™. That was me.   Then, 8th grade happens. I show up first day of school expecting another year of revulsion, but suddenly my friends are downright chummy. Cool! Maybe everyone forgot over the summer! Ugh but the girls, those accusatory glares.....are conspicuously...absent. I'm going to dances. I'm holding hands. Why is everyone so suddenly.....nice?  OH HELL NO! YOU ALL FUCKING TOOK YOUR JUNK OUT FOR A TEST DRIVE AND DECIDED YOU LIKED HOW IT HANDLED. I was the goddamn test pilot and I crashed and burned, but you fucking lemmings decided that I had a thing going on that demanded further investigation.

t5_2qh13,lawstudent2,1343792545,"I disagree emphatically, and I'm a practicing intellectual property attorney.  What most artists *want*, as opposed to what © law provides, is *misappropriation law* which is also called *trademark.* To put this in layman's terms, the most important thing is that people do not reproduce your work *and claim it as their own.* That is the operative part: attribution. Giving credit where it is due. Letting people know **which artist created what, and not claiming the work of others as your own.** Copyright law is not in any, way, shape or form designed at protecting this. Instead, copyright law requires that for a fucking millisecond sample of someone else's song, for even *leaning* on an idea that is older than Shakespeare or Plato, for even referencing a commonly accepted fact, you need to get contracts signed by a half a dozen assholes. Copyright law is designed around protection of **permission.**  **This is preposterous.** Because **fuck** your permission. Speech, and ideas, are free. I should -- and do -- have every right to reproduce your ideas for the purpose of criticism, critique, and, yes, even commerce. Yet the absurdities of title 17, the DMCA, the technicalities of strike suits and strategic suits against public participation make copyright an effective vehicle for censorship, anticompetitive business practices and government enforced monopolies. I find this sickening.  Instead, what artists care about (and, if they don't, they are stupid) is **attribution.** Exempli gratia: Selling Nike Sneakers. More below.  Yes, you can use pictures of my work in articles, news stories, reproductions, derivations, satire, criticisms, reworkings, remixes, etc., just do me the favor of **crediting me. Do not claim that my creations are your own, even if you make money off of selling them.** This is what trademark law covers: you cannot reproduce, or 'pass off' the work of another as your own. If you sell Nike sneakers, you cannot rebrand them as moistanddampsneakers, even if you sell them at your store and make a profit. No, instead, you must keep the Nike logo on them. This exact same principle applies to art of any form, and the central ideas are protection against misappropriation, unfair competition and consumer protection. You all have google, look these concepts up. They are not difficult.  **This debate is called ""attribution v. permission culture.""** As someone who is related to artists, personally an erstwhile software developer, currently general counsel for a software company, a holder of degrees in mathematics, physics, and law, who is bar admitted and practicing, please let me assure you that copyright law takes a very close second place to patent law in the pantheon of hideous, absurd, backwards modern american intellectual property institutions. If you are an artist and think copyright protects your living, you are gravely and systematically misinformed, and you make me sad, good sir knight. **Any redditor who believes that permission culture is superior to attribution culture should delete their account immediately.** Think it through, people. Permission culture is a load of bullshit, and runs counter to every ideal this online community holds sacred, and, importantly, is based upon. Net neutrality, the first amendment, anonymous, remix culture -- these are all based upon the idea of attribution culture, as opposed to permission culture. If you truly believe that permission culture is the way to go, please, leave this site and enjoy living in the 17th century. Also, I hate you.  Art, like any other business, is about connecting with humans and selling them things they are willing to pay for at a fair price. If you think that copyright law is required to make this equation balance, you sincerely need a re-education in economics and psychology. Because it simply isn't true. This is the central part of that article, btw: copyright law always has, and always will be, about enforcing arbitrary government sponsored, privately owned monopoly over *ideas themselves.* If this concept does not sicken you, my god, get the fuck off my planet. /rant  **tl;dr I'm an intellectual property attorney and, no, copyright law, even in theory, is an unsalvageable mess that hurts innovation. Misappropriation / trademark law is all that is necessary to protect art / artists, and if you believe otherwise, you are pretty sincerely mistaken.**",©
t5_2tr68,atouk_zug,1343793208,"Putting everything else aside, ""OpenSDRDharp"" has no GPL protections at all.  A GPL must have a full legal name (aliases and pseudomyms are not allowed), and contact information in it.  The current version on the project page (OpenSDRSharp_v_0_0_1_Full), contains nothing other than a mirror image of an SDR# release, and a few added files.  One of these is a blank boilerplate GPL v3 (June 2007).  A blank GPL is not a placeholder.  It is as about as nonbinding a document you can get.  Only an empty file can be less binding, but linux users will even argue that it is still possible to see who created it.  The only copyrights that appear anywhere within the are;  Copyright © Youssef TOUIL 2012 (4 files.  You missed a few)  Copyright (C) 2012  OpenSDRSharp (49 files)  Copyright © GPL v2 (6 files)   The first is the proper and original copyright that was contained in the files as copied from the SDR# depository.  The 2nd is contained in most of the files where it REPLACED the proper copyright above it.  It is meaningless because OpenSDRSharp is not a proper entity in person or other registered entity.  The 3rd is contained in some of the files in place of the proper Youssef copyright, and is also meaninglesss.  The 2nd two examples are a direct and intentional subversion and defacement of the proper Youssef copyright.  Now to the empty GPL.  An incomplete GPL is a worthless document.  ALL of the required fields must be filled out to make it valid.  They even make it easy for you by showing you where to insert the proper information, such as "" Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;"".  But there's a problem with that.  You refuse to tell people your true name and would rather hide behind a nickname.  Also it states ""Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.""  Well that's just not going to happen either.  Real name + real contact info = people findng out who I am!  And there's further trouble.  These two lines;     b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or     author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal     Notices displayed by works containing it; or      c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or     requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in     reasonable ways as different from the original version; or   Section b requires preservation of author attributions.  But you just went and changed all of them in the source code!  And section c warns about misrepresenting the origin of the material.  Oopsies, changing them darn copyrights violated that little clause too.  Now in another folder we have an even different version of the GPL  Version 2 (June 1992).  And gosh darnit, that one's blank boilerplate, too.  Some days it's tough to get anything right, isn't it.",©

t5_2qh1e,Hovdizzle,1343795735,"This is something that happened to me about a month ago, but I'm lazy so instead of retyping everything, I'm just going to copy/paste EVERYTHING (conversations that are off topic included) I wrote about the situation on my FB page...  Andrew (me): Dear drunk people of Idaho Falls or those driving a car with an Arizona licence plate: Don't drink and drive. That way I, shirtless guy, and the Affliction wearing bro I was hanging out with who's name I don't know wont have to chase you down and restrain you when you try to flee the scene. Those air bags saved your life and I'm certain that canal looked like a good place for you to end it.  You're welcome.   Sincerely,   Me.  Andrew: Also, this Quesdilla from Bertos is massive. I dont understand how the expect me to eat it without a fork.   Amber: they dont   Amber: thats part of the joke   Andrew: It's not very funny then. D:   Emily: WTF?   Keri: I think another one of my friends was referring to the same guy in one of his posts. O.o Wait, did this guy crash into a canal or a Taco Bell? None of the above?   Andrew: None of the above. He ran into a truck that was parked on the street, hitting it hard enough to knock it into this persons driveway, smashing in to a SUV that was parked there. Then he skidded down the street past my buddy Sam's place before the car wouldn't move any more. This all happened while we were having a fire in Sams back yard.  By the time we all made it to the car, which was REALLY messed up, the guy whose truck got hit was already there and was on the phone with 911. The guy driving the car was fine, other than the fact that he was wasted. Everybody tells him to go sit down so he stumbles over to the sidewalk slowly, but doesn't sit down. Instead he makes his way across the street up the bank of a canal and keeps walking, then starts running when everyone tells him to stop. So Shirtless guy who I am assuming was a friend/relative of the guy whose truck got creamed, Affliction bro who was part of the party I was hanging out with and myself start chasing after the dude, who makes like he's going to jump in the canal, which if he did he would have probably drowned. Us three get the guy tackled and restrained just as a cop shows up and takes over.   Fun night all around. In total I think the guy damaged about four or five cars. Thankfully this happened around one in the morning and nobody but the turd driving the car got hurt.  http://i.imgur.com/gyB9y.jpg  Drunk dudes car that he drove half way down the street after smashing into the truck.  (That's basically the end of what happened to me, but my on the same night my friend got to experience a drunk driver smashing through the lobby of a Taco Bell, which he describes later on in the thread. Thankfully he was in the drive through at the time it happened)  Keri: I love your stories. :) Sounds intense! How do you end up catching all the excitement? Haha! Glad no one got hurt!   Cherryn: OMG! that is quite the story.... Tay saw the one that happened at Taco Bell... I will let him tell the story though. Way to go helping to save the day Andy!   Allen: Good catch Bro!   Andrew: Wait....someone crashed into Taco Bell?   Keri: Haha, yes. On 17th.   Andrew: When did this happen? MY TACOS!   Allen: Pshhhhhh betos is better   Amber: I'm willing to bet ""Affliction Bro"" was my buddy Christopher. He is fond of wearing Affliction, posted a photo of a wrecked vehicle with the caption ""tackled a drunk trying to flee"" and was at SAMs Palace of Poon (or something close to that) last night. Now, do I get a prize for identifying said ""bro""?  Andrew: Hahhahaah. I forgot that we tagged sams place as that now. Pretty sure that's him.   Andrew: Also Amber, you've been blessed with some stellar boobs. I think that right there is prize enough for anything. :3   Erica: Why are you still there? Seems like nothing but shenanigans. Already been to ID &amp; AZ &amp; back home to NJ &amp; now Philly. Read the signs man. The most unrest I had was in ID. Although, I still attest, any run in with police in IF was surprising positive. They maybe felt bad for me because im from NJ. Just run. Im going to gamble in Atlantic City &amp; hope luck pays out.   Andrew: Hahaha. If only it were that easy. Also, I miss your face Jersey.   Erica: Oh boy, you dont know how easy it is. Actually its awful. The Jersey nickname doesn't fly when you grew up here. Im missin your face also. I have to go hang out with the mafia now. Going to make it big in Atlantic City, ya heard??!!   Erica: I kid, but there's one way to roll...im irish, so im mildly accepted   Emily: OMG. This is one of the best Facebook posts I've seen in awhile.   Erica: Conglomorate of crazies.. Thats what this is.   Andrew: I feel so loved. Win me a car while you're out there gambling. ♥  Ellis: Srsly, Jerz- me too! I could use a new one ;)  Taylor: whoa Andy that is nuts! hahaha I was waiting in front of the Taco Bell drive through window when I heard the screeching of big tires, then BAM, CRASH, WHAM (kinda like an old batman episode apparently) and the Taco Bell workers were FREAKIN out, and I couldn't see what happened cause I was just behind the building at the drive through window. They had us all reverse and go out the neighboring driveway, cause a truck had plowed into Taco Bell's dining area, and was blocking the drive through exit, rofl. Retarded people are retarded. All I can say is, glad my order was not harmed in this accident, bahaha   Andrew: Hahahah. Wow that sounds freaking awesome/a little freaky. Did you get any pictures?   Andrew: Also Taylor your description reminds me of this...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mYHzIz57KM&amp;feature=related  ""Reality Hits You Hard, Bro"" - Original Interview   Andrew: And this!  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tcgw73CxEzs&amp;feature=fvwrel  Songify This: Reality Hits You Hard Bro (Extended Version)    And that's the end.

t5_2qh13,lawstudent2,1343797192,"Out of curiosity, how many times have you sued someone for copyright infringement?   My guess is that the number is somewhere between precisely zero and precisely zero. A copyright suit takes about fifty to a hundred grand to reach conclusion. If you are making that kind of money as an artist, that you can just kick 50k to your lawyers, disregard the rest of my post, because you are already doing kickass. 100:1, however, you are not.  Curiosity question series #2: Do you create art because of the nuance of copyright law? Do you even know how one goes about copyrighting things? Do you even know how you would go about enforcing a copyright? My sincere guess, to all of these, is ""no fucking clue,"" except for the question ""why do you create things,"" to which the answer, I assume / hope is ""because **i fucking love creating things.**"" Notice how 17 usc 106 didn't get within a country mile of that? Probably not. Whatever.  &gt; like becoming a speaker/pundit. Frankly this is all pretty low brow, and not to do with my craft.   Again, boohoo. Seriously, fuck yourself. If you are such a fucking snob you cannot lower yourself to the idea of 'making money,' I not only have no sympathy for you, I have active antipathy for you and you are probably cruising off of my (gladly paid) tax dollars.   I am an 'artist' too. I write constantly and hope to one day sell my workproduct. But the idea that I should have to fuck myself because you are on a vision-quest to make money off of your craft makes me vomit into my loafers. It's called adulthood. Compromises are required. You sell to people who are willing to buy. You may not love your audience, but you embrace them otherwise. If you cannot deal with these facts, you will never be self sustaining as an artist.  Do us a favor: keep crafting, and keep selling it. Copyright law has nothing to do with it. The quality of your craft and the audience for your craft is 100% of the equation. If you do not understand this, it is probably because you are an artist and not an economist, lawyer, mathematician or psychologist. So keep making your art, and do everyone a favor: be fucking good at it, be kind to your audience, listen to them and treat them like human beings. This is the key to success. The six reserved rights of © doctrine are utterly irrelevant to this quest. And if you spend time worrying about ©, please, please realize this is time you should be spending creating new art, and you are just fucking yourself.",©

t5_2qvm1,islandprincessgirl,1343803821,"Island Princess' Secrets to Help You Feel Better   © Dmitri Zakovorotny | Dreamstime.com  Aloha and Talofa (hello), I would like to share some simple steps to beating depression and thinking positive.  These are motivational and inspirational actions that help me every time.   When I had my 'mini-princess' I suffered post-natal depression.  It was like going into a dark room, filled with pictures of all the sad and bitter parts of my life.  Here are a few things that helped me, and I hope they can help you too, princes and princesses.  Remember, the night is very dark, but there is always a sunrise.   1) Every day I forced myself to walk outside.  It was winter (I don't live on a tropical island currently) and the air was very cold, but full of fresh oxygen that made me feel better immediately, got my blood circulating well and helped me to sleep better.  My mini-princess went with me in a baby sling and it helped her sleep better too.  Cold air does not make you sick, if it is fresh and full of oxygen.  As long as you are dressed well and moving around in fresh air, even cold air can strengthen your immune system, but be careful if you are already suffering from sickness or a lung condition.  Tips for fresh-air walking: When walking in the fresh air take full advantage of it by breathing deeply and thinking about calming and relaxing things.  Even shallow breathing can cause a physical feeling of depression (I get this easily as I have lung problems, ever since having pneumonia as a child)               The freshest air is in a forest-covered mountain or next to an     un-polluted beach.  Beaches are so special because of the          ‘negative ions’ in the air.  We have too many positive ions        indoors because of all the electric appliances and re-breathing     the air.  To be truly refreshed, go out into nature.    © Dmitri Zakovorotny | Dreamstime.com  2) Sitting inside and keeping still are the worst things for your body and mind.  Even if you are not depressed, you could become depressed simply by doing this.  If you have no choice but to be inside, make sure there is some fresh air circulating, and get a fun (safe) exercise video to do in your lounge room.  In the islands, we love to dance, and even now I love dancing in my lounge room, much to the amusement of my prince.  My favourites are Zumba and belly dancing workouts.  3) TV, video games, and especially the news can be depressing in large doses.  We were created to be outside, princes and princesses, looking up at the stars, not stuck to a screen.  As soon as I cut down on these unnatural pursuits I felt better.  Gaming and media addictions are real and can cause depression and anxiety because they reduce your time in real life and reduce your confidence to associate with real people.  I was so addicted to reading fantasy, but once I realized I preferred the fantasy to my real life, I quit.  Media addictions can be harder to quit than heroin, so if you or your family and friends think you are addicted, you may need a professional counselor or psychologist.   4) Even though I love islands, we were not created to be an island.  Isolation or keeping to yourself is a sign of depression, and a cause of depression too.  I didn’t want to tell anyone that I was depressed, because I was afraid they would think of me as a bad mama.  But keeping all my feelings to myself meant I had no support network and I was emotionally isolated.  By all means don’t tell someone who will criticize you, but talk, talk, talk to people who have your best interests at heart.  You will be amazed at how communicating immediately helps you feel better.  Professional counselors and psychologists are a great option, so that the whole burden of your emotions does not fall only to your sister, or boyfriend, or spouse.  If your depression is long-term they will need a support network too!    © Jinyoung Lee | Dreamstime.com  5) Special note: There are certain people who will isolate you and cut off your other family and friends however they can.  Spouses, boyfriends, girlfriends, friends, parents and more can all isolate you.  They will make you feel it is bad to tell anyone else outside of the little island the controlling person has created with you.  I will discuss this more in a separate post, that isolation is a sign you are with a controlling, even bad, person.  Remember, no-one has a right to own your thoughts and feelings.  You have a right to share them with any trustworthy person.  When something is not right you feel it in your stomach, and that uneasiness in itself and reluctance to share is a sign that you must tell someone that something is not right.  If the first person doesn’t listen, you must tell someone else and preferably (again) speak to a professional.  ‘Mauruuru’ (thanks a lot in Tahitian) for reading ‘secrets to feeling better’.  All the best in your journey and please comment if you would like to ask questions or share your thoughts and tips on feeling better.  Xx ‘Island Princess’  P.S. If you are so depressed that you can’t get into action or get out of bed, I am begging you to call a professional or a depression hotline immediately.  These people are not afraid of your sad, bad, mad emotions and they are waiting to listen.  It is a dark night for you, but the sunrise will always come.   P.P.S.  Depression can cause fear of socialising.  It is a normal symptom, but it is important that you talk to a professional or join a support group as soon as possible.  ",©

t5_2qh13,ThorLives,1343806406,"&gt; What most artists want, as opposed to what © law provides, is misappropriation law which is also called trademark.  No, it's not.  I'm a software developer and I want to earn a living from my work.  I don't believe your ""attribution copyright"" solves that problem.  &gt; Letting people know which artist created what, and not claiming the work of others as your own. Copyright law is not in any, way, shape or form designed at protecting this.  Yes, it is.  It just covers a lot more than that.  &gt; Speech, and ideas, are free.  You mean that in the ""natural world"" speech and ideas are free.  In the natural world, life is also short, brutish and nasty.  We've spent a long time trying to get away from the evils of the natural world.  You also don't have to pay taxes in the ""natural world"".  I suppose you're also going to complain about having to pay taxes?  Additionally, we're not talking about ""ideas"" here, since copyright covers a specific body of work, not just an ""idea"" or even ""speech"" for that matter.  &gt; Instead, what artists care about (and, if they don't, they are stupid) is attribution.  Yeah, all of us who disagree are ""stupid"".  Nice pre-emptive ad hominem for anyone who's going to disagree with you.  By the way, you should seriously checkout Creative Commons because it sounds like you've never heard of it.  &gt; as someone who is related to artists, personally an erstwhile software developer, currently general counsel for a software company, a holder of degrees in mathematics, physics, and law, who is bar admitted and practicing  WTF is the reason for even writing this, except to make some weird claim that ""You're very smart, so you must be right""?  &gt; Any redditor who believes that permission culture is superior to attribution culture should delete their account immediately.  Use some words to make your point rather than preemptively attacking anyone who disagrees with you.  &gt; copyright law always has, and always will be, about enforcing arbitrary government sponsored, privately owned monopoly over ideas themselves.  You've only proven that you don't actually know much about copyright, because copyright **isn't about ideas**.  There are tons of ways to remix ideas in ways that don't violate copyright.  Assuming you actually are a lawyer, you should know this.  Here's one example - checkout ""StarFront: Collision"".  It's a game that's an obvious ripoff of Starcraft.  It's also **not** a copyright violation, hence proving that **COPYRIGHT ISN'T ABOUT IDEAS**.  http://techland.time.com/2011/02/07/gamefronts-starfront-collision-looks-eerily-like-starcraft/",©

I must say that learning on the older aircraft models is a much more rewarding experience. I fly a Cherokee in BC, Canada and a 182 in the US (long story about dual country license/training). Both aircraft teach you to fly visually, and the Cherokee is just great for stall and spin training. Are the cirruses rated for stalls and spins? Parachutes are great and all that, but in most accident reports with those planes I've read, they state that *overconfidence in the parachute* was a key factor in those crashes.  Also, would you feel confident flying a from digital to analog? Be honest with yourself here.   Just my two cents. If you're ever in BC or Utah in late august PM me, mate!

t5_2szbf,The_Stoic_One,1343815010,"If the ph of your tap water is 7.4, then something in your tank is raising the ph. I don't see anything in the pics that could be the culprit, but it's a bit hard to see everything.  I see that your tank has only been running for two weeks. For the first few weeks, ecocomplete will increase kh and ph. This is direct from CaribSea: "" While Eco-Complete™ Planted does not affect pH and KH long term, you will find that it will give a small bump to both of these parameters initially, and this is especially noticeable with the use of RO /DI water. Fortunately this is just a small amount of Calcium Carbonate that is on, not in the substrate and it will dissipate with the first couple of water changes, usually in the first couple weeks. Planting the tank will also help. Keep in mind that one should never add particularly sensitive animals to a tank in the first few weeks anyway but that this is especially important with this situation if the animals are pH sensitive- requiring a low pH.""  if this is the case, do a 30% water change every 3-4 days until your ph drops to normal and stays that way.   Also, those ph uppers and downers are crap. They will lower/raise you ph for a bit, but whatever is causing the problem will cause it to bounce right back.  While your ammonia level is low, it should be at 0ppm which leads me to believe your tank wasn't fully cycled before you began stocking it. It usually takes 4-8 weeks to fully cycle a tank and in that time the initial ph increase from the ecocomplete probably would have subsided if that is indeed the issue.  Since your tank is not cycled, your nitrites probably haven't made their initial spike yet.  This usually takes a couple weeks to happen. Once it spikes, you may lose the rest of your fish.  Don't get too discouraged though, it's a common mistake that most pet stores don't explain to customers. Check out the link on the right under beginner info titled nitrogen cycle for more information.  You may get lucky and your fish may survive, but if not, read up on the nitrogen cycle and ""fishless cycle"" and give it another go. Good luck.",™

t5_2qhqb,0x0D0A,1343836690,"How it happened:  * Adultery is not a criminal offence. * Most decisions with the benefits system are decided by a strict legal framework to ensure fairness. * The benefits system currently has a much looser definition of partnership than marriage or civil union because many people haven't registered their partnership with the government. * Recognising polygamous relationships within the benefits system helps to *save* money. * If the system is changed to only recognise monogamy, then - within the system - more people are viewed as single (and get more benefit as a consequence).  Edit: Despite what The Gatestone Institute has to say about this being a problem with *Muslim* polygamy, as a *Gay White Male™* I'd just like to point out that these kinds of unconventional living arrangements are not entirely confined to that subset of the population.",™
t5_2s30g,echofive,1343839108,"Wow.  Post is real confusing.  Then again, you sound real confused.  Is John™ leading you on?  You're having feelings for a guy.  It sounds like you don't want to accept them.  Since you've never allowed yourself to feel deeply for someone (based on the facts presented) it sounds as if you're going through the same emotional turmoil many people did (myself included) when they first started having these kinds of experiences.  &gt;Do I tell him I'm emotionally retarded?  Yes.  If you want him to understand why you're behaving the way you are, and why you bit him, it'd help if you let him know.  &gt;That I love him and it's terrifying?  Yes, if you love him and you're terrified let him know what's going on.  I fear nothing more than irrationality and not understanding why something is happening, so not understanding why you're behaving the way you are would make me very uneasy.  &gt;Do some men intentionally play with women's feelings?  Yes.  Next question.  &gt;How can I be sure it's genuine?  There is no tried and true method to know if anyone's feelings are genuine.  Even worse, his feelings could be perfectly genuine right now and then change a week, a month, a year down the road.  That's the peril of deeply invested emotional relationships, but the benefits are also excellent when they succeed.  &gt;Is the risk worth the potential benefit? Should I just dip?  That's a personal question that only you can answer.  I have had and continue to have serious issues with trust and intimacy, but taking the plunge with my significant other has been the best decision of my life.  It's up to you to decide what you want and how you're going to get there.  TL;DR - Take a breath.  Figure out what you want.  If what you want is a relationship, try to understand how that may look and how you're reasonably going to get there.  You'll do fine.",™

t5_21of,win2012,1343846327,"Gold medal gymnast Shawn Johnson is taking questions on the Today Show’s Facebook page. The West Des Moines native is a special correspondent for the long-running morning show on NBC, the exclusive U.S. broadcaster of theLondon 2012 Olympics.  Facebook fans are asking her everything from what it was like as a former competitor to watch the U.S. Women’s Gymnastics team win gold to what it was like to do a commercial with Matthew Perry. The commercial plugs his new sitcom, called ""Go On,"" in which he plays a sportscaster going to group therapy. He consoles her for being an Olympic loser, to which she says ""No, I won a gold medal."" His reply is, ""and three silvers ... loser, loser, loser."" Then he's giving her a hug telling her it's OK. “It was so much fun doing the commercial,” Johnson answered. “Matthew Perry was one of the nicest people I've ever met. I've love to go back to the show for a visit!”  Others commenting are obviously Iowans, proud of their Olympic champion who won a gold medal on the balance beam in the 2008 Beijing Olympics.  Here’s a sampling from the shout stream:  Ethan Furnish: How is it Shawn being an Olympic champion and getting to see these girls become champions?  Edward True: Iowans ♥ Shawn Johnson  Greg Pack: Hey Shawn,Do you miss the Olympics and do you still wish you were competing in this Olympics?  Heather Roberts: What was your favorite thing about USA Gymnastics last night?  Tracy Ramsey: Have fun kiddo, and tell Gabby that Des Moines has a heck of a 'welcome home' for her.  Trisha Anderson Rogers: What advise, as a former Olympian, do you have for the Fab Five as they wrap up and will be heading home?  Jessica Smith: You are truly an inspiration Shawn. My daughter loves watching the commerical with you and your mom doing the routine in a house! Congratulations on your successes and many wishes of luck for your future!  Steven Bailey: What happened to the Russians last night? They seemed defeated before they took the floor. Did they get some bad news before the meet?  Laci White: How does it feel to be on the spectator side of the Olympics? What do you miss most?? BTW: You make us fellow Iowans very proud. Thanks for representing us so well.",♥

The Jonesboro Sun newspaper reports that Chavis Chacobie Carter shot himself Saturday night. Carter, 21, had been picked up on a felony warrant from Mississippi.  The bench warrant was issued by DeSoto County Circuit Court for contempt of court when Carter violated the terms of his three-year probation, according to court records.  Carter, whose address according to court records is the 8800 block of Sweet Flag Loop in Southaven, was arrested and charged in 2010 for two counts of sale of a controlled substance, marijuana. He was indicted on the charges by a DeSoto County grand jury in January 2011.  According to DeSoto County Circuit Court records, Carter pleaded guilty to one count on Aug. 31, 2011.  He received a non-adjudicated sentence, which allows first-time nonviolent defendants to complete certain conditions to avoid having a conviction on their record. Carter was ordered to successfully complete three years of probation and pay $100 a month for $2,154.50 in court costs assessments. He also was ordered to report for drug tests and pay drug testing fees.  Jonesboro Police Chief Mike Yates says his department is conducting an internal investigation after the death.  A police report says Carter was in the back of a patrol car with his hands cuffed behind his back when officers discovered he'd been shot.

Humans face their ultimate faith challenge and culture trade with intergalactic species is a common thing for kids (both humans and bio machines) that born from this year on.

t5_2qkdk,Iam7of9,1343869795,"Haha, from what I understand of bitches within my current cultural context of Oakland, they are anything but meek.  In fact, being a bitch could be advantageous in my conundrum, as I’d love to more decisive about which project I’ll propose!   :p   In terms of my background, I’m a former foster kid who moved to China for two years while I taught English, I then spent 8 months in Germany working as an nanny.  After 3 years, I returned to US and attended a community college for 2 years.  After graduating, I attended UC Berkeley where I double majored in anthropology and psychology.  Psychology was actually my first major and I was actually in the middle of writing my honors thesis on empathy and Social Dominance Orientation when I realized I’d actually accrued enough anthro credits to take on the additional degree.   After graduating, I worked in two non-profits until I saved up enough money for a trip to South America where I travelled, volunteered at two organizations for 2 months (I wish I’d focused more on this) and studied Spanish.  Since returning, I’ve been teaching an advanced ESL class.   Wow, life story.  Anyway, I can see myself working in the realm of android technology with a specific focus in Cognitive Psychology and virtual world social behaviors.  To do this, it would be amazing to work in both the U.S. and Japan, although I speak no Japanese!  In South America, I’m interested in going back to La Paz and studying how issues such as child autism are interpreted and addressed by local cultures.  In Peru, I’m fascinated by archaeological processes and how they impact traditional communities.  More generally, I am also interested in the development of non-profits and how an anthropological lens can be incorporated into such programs so that they’re more inclusive/reflective of indigenous interests and methodologies.    Again, I apologize for the novel, I’m notoriously long-winded.    Do you think it is possible for me to sort of design multiple projects and submit them to different professors and just make a wish that someone will want to snatch me up?  Any other advice you have would be greatly appreciated ☺  ",☺

Of course she was moaning nooo at this point but she was too horny to do anything but have me keep eating her out while taunting her about the possibility. I typed in “hey, what are you up to?” (any texting is not verbatim since this was on her phone and not mine so I don’t have records) to keep it tame into her phone and kept taunting her that she’d like it if I pressed send wouldn’t she, and eventually she relented and I pressed send. He didn’t answer for a while which was disappointing at first but he said something like “hey glad to hear from you stranger”. After that I texted back “I wish you were still here” and he wrote back, “I know I keep wishing we could have just hung out forever”. After I showed her that text she got so much hornier (not exactly sure why it was this point that got her into super horny mode but it was) which was so fucking hot, she was moaning “oh god” and “holy shit” while I just kept eating her out which was amazing (I made sure not to let her cum which was driving her crazy). I texted back “me too I had a lot of fun ☺” and then he texted “Fun doesn’t even begin to describe it. Ally, I didn’t even know what amazing sex was until last night”. After that she didn’t even resist at all when I showed her I was texting back “I feel the exact same way ☺”. And he texted back “You have no idea how glad I am you think so”.",☺

So I said, I know you’re a slutty enough girl that you want him to sleep over again don’t you (which I knew would work since it worked every time when I was convincing her to imagine I was him in the early days of us pretending I was him and her being reluctant about even that). And she said (after a few more nooo’s) “Oh my god yesss, I’m so sorry I’m such a bad girl”. I almost came right there but managed not to and just texted “Hey it turns out my parents and brother extended their trip, want to sleep over again?” And he texted “Of course I do. I’ll be there in 15, is that okay?” and I texted “Yes ☺” and showed her. After that she kept saying oh my god I can’t believe we’re doing this again, is this really a good idea? Which to be honest was more apprehensive than I was expecting her to be but we both knew it was going to happen again and I had to hurry to grab my stuff and hurry down the street in the opposite direction he was going to drive from. In retrospect I wish I had said give me an hour or something to give us more time to talk about it but in the heat of the moment I didn’t think of that.

t5_2r4eo,matriarchy,1343876122,"There are people with legitimate questions. We try to direct them to places like Google where they can search out the answers to their own questions. If any given member of SRS sat around answering questions, how many times would they have to answer the same question? Reddit employs a fractal comment system and is quite hard to get all of the good contributing responses into an easily accessible place.  Look at /r/atheism's FAQ. If a theist wandered in and started debating based upon a 101 idea, they are pointed to the FAQ or an article to learn about the ideology and justifications because it is too much to expect an individualized answer every single time someone trots out Pascal's Wager. If they continue to debate w/o educating themselves AFTER this, they will be banned because they're debating in bad faith. SRS employs a similar strategy except we point people to Google search or an actual direct link should we have one on hand. (Note: the latter part is from individual people in the SRS subreddits outside SRSprime, mods have to deal with too many bad opinions to do anything outside of banning.) Strict moderation is used to separate those entering discussion in bad faith from the one's entering in good faith. Good faith: admitting you do not know everything and honestly seeking all knowledge before coming to a conclusion. Bad faith: not being open to the possibility of being wrong.  SRSprime is for circlejerking about bad opinions™. The rest of the fempire has many educational and contemporary links to expand knowledge of sociology and social justice works.  The impetus to learning is on the person wishing to know. I, and many others, don't want to waste effort on someone intellectually lazy enough to not seek out knowledge on their own -- especially since none of us are being paid to be some anonymous person's tutor.

It is mostly meat but there is some spices and water in there. The texture when it's fresh made is very juicy and delicious. After a half an hour of sitting around, it is a little dry. We are required to stir it every 5-10 minutes to spread the juices around.  *****  **[Question](/r/IAmA/comments/xjgyu/_/c5mvx2b?context=1) (hoorayforboobies):**  &gt; How long is it kept for?

We usually use all the beef in the pan up within 30 minutes. It's on a heater the whole time so it stays warm. I definitely recommend trying it.  *****  **[Question](/r/IAmA/comments/xjgyu/_/c5mvwz4?context=1) (flyingcars):**  &gt; I worked at Taco Bell ages ago (1997ish) and the food preparation was always very clean.  Only gross thing I remember was that the occasional bag of slightly funky lettuce would get used (the lettuce was not past expiration or anything, but there was just something off about it).  So, what is the grossest thing you have seen happen with food prep at your Taco Bell?  **[Answer](/r/IAmA/comments/xjgyu/_/c5mvysa?context=1) (Lupinee):**  &gt; Yeah, I've seen the lettuce like that. The grossest thing I've seen has to be the fried foods. We'll keep the oil there for hours upon hours with stuff floating in it (old potatoes, tortilla chips). The fried food still tastes good but it is a little gross.  *****  **[Question](/r/IAmA/comments/xjgyu/_/c5mvyb1?context=1) (obamawho):**  &gt; Why do blacks work at Taco Bell but Mexicans work at McDonalds?  I notice that everywhere. Any insight?  **[Answer](/r/IAmA/comments/xjgyu/_/c5mvzt5?context=1) (Lupinee):**  &gt; Haha, it isn't like that where I live. Blacks work at Taco Bell mostly and McDonalds is also full of blacks. Every black person I've worked with has been a lot quicker than most people who work there. We hire people who will be fast and be able to keep up with the pace of our orders.  *****  **[Question](/r/IAmA/comments/xjgyu/_/c5mw1j1?context=1) (lovin_take_a_hold):**  &gt; What percentage of your customers are high?  **[Answer](/r/IAmA/comments/xjgyu/_/c5mw2ey?context=1) (Lupinee):**  &gt; Maybe 5% before 10:00 PM.

They used to be regular old tortilla chips that came in a bag.

I've seen it being put on the food with some sort of caulk gun, which was unpleasant.   **[Answer](/r/IAmA/comments/xjgyu/_/c5mwr75?context=1) (Lupinee):**  &gt; It comes in a tube that we put in a caulk gun thingy. The gun never touches the sour cream though.  *****  **[Question](/r/IAmA/comments/xjgyu/_/c5mwtlo?context=1) (ShaneD27):**  &gt; Would you say the Doritos Locos Taco is the best thing to happen to Taco Bell in years?  **[Answer](/r/IAmA/comments/xjgyu/_/c5mwuwz?context=1) (Lupinee):**  &gt; Yes, we make so much money off of it and it is so good.  *****  (continued below)",™

t5_2cneq,TomSelleckPI,1343904456,"Could you break it down a little, for those of us who are wondering just how you do it.  I imagine its goes something like this:    Wake up around 5, maybe a quick shower, then straight into a strong session of internet hate while the coffee is brewing.    Then a break for coffee, and a huge dump of course... No one can ingest that much hate and not have a colon full of hell spawn and wrath.  A quick pinch-off and right back into more internet hate.  Probably on the couch, but maybe you are a bit classier than I imagine and you got one of those fancy roll-up desks with the little cuby-holes.  Your wife calls it a desk, but you call it **The Hate-Station™.** You even say the ""TM"" out loud when you talk about it with your friend. Your wife said it was a silly name once, but it only took two black eyes for that never to happen again.  I digress...  So back to the keyboard, where your fastidious little fingers peck away on your pretty little hate machine: 52 words per minute. It used to be 74 but you broke 4 fingers in a tragic anal fisting session back in 99'... It was a good year... But you can only type so long before the daemons of an empty stomach starts screaming for more hate fuel... Chick-fil-a #4, ""white"" cheese of course...  So now those pointy little hate daggers don't move so fast, but they still get er' done.  You have added a second screen to the ""Hate Station"" so that can have live Breitbart RSS feeds and Foxnews.com running side by side with your thesaurus desktop widget: finding synonyms for hate and antonyms for tolerance can help keep the gears rolling on that old Windows 9H8 machine.  After pounding out a few epic rounds of hate spewing on several different internet forums, muddying the waters of the rare constructive conversation, you throw in the clutch and switch hate gears into some quick and effortless 'Heets'... that's hate-speak for hate-tweets... The International Hate Association adopted the term 'Heets' after a growing number of members thought it was clever... Ironically, most members are beginning to hate the term so there is growing debate over whether to continue to use it...  But I digress again...  As the sun sets, and your 'heets' get buried in the massive piles of forgotten digital waste, you move back to your roots, and start typing up a 7 page chain mail.  Though this old mare just ain't what she used to be either, these days you just click a button to update a list of 30 key ""Hate words"" that are pumped through the digital hateosphere and the hate mail just generates itself... you just have to click send.  Leaving you with plenty of time for some self-loathing caused by the enormous force of cognitive dissonance churning in your ever shrinking cerebral cortex...  Its not too much longer before you start to yawn.  So you warm a nice cup of cocoa and babies blood, and check on the hate seeds you planted earlier in the day on reddit.  Occasionally you get a few down votes here and there.... but every once in a while, once in a red moon, you get a metric ass ton of down votes... its these moments that pay the dividends, these moments that make it so easy to fall asleep at night, knowing you have a brand new day of hate coming just around the bend...   Well... how close was I?  I'm probably a bit off, i bet you don't really say the ""TM"" out loud, at least not anymore. Get some rest buddy.",™

I think C25k Reddit is about a program, and you think it's about simply achieving the goal of running 5k.  I don't see where that can be reconciled.   I would leave you with this pre-amble from the CoolRunning website, which attempts to define C25k :    **[The Couch-to-5K ® Running Plan](http://www.coolrunning.com/engine/2/2_3/181.shtml)** Our beginner's running schedule has helped thousands of new runners get off the couch and onto the roads, running 3 miles in just two months.  Our beginner's running schedule has helped thousands of new runners get started.   **By Josh Clark** Too many people have been turned off of running simply by trying to start off too fast. Their bodies rebel, and they wind up miserable, wondering why anyone would possibly want to do this to themselves.  You should ease into your running program gradually. In fact, the beginners' program we outline here is less of a running regimen than a walking and jogging program. The idea is to transform you from couch potato to runner, getting you running three miles (or 5K) on a regular basis in just two months.  It's easy to get impatient, and you may feel tempted to skip ahead in the program, but hold yourself back. Don't try to do more, even if you feel you can. If, on the other hand, you find the program too strenuous, just stretch it out. Don't feel pressured to continue faster than you're able. Repeat weeks if needed and move ahead only when you feel you're ready",®

t5_2r9tk,Hiskitten,1343916681,"i've thought that maybe the reason i haven't reacted yet is because i don't think it's really over. As angry and hurt as i am, i have always felt He is my soul mate, it wasn't just sex, it wasn't just D/s, it was a friendship that transcended any other relationship i'd ever had. It began as a friendship, we were both with others when we met online, but after losing touch for a couple of years, finding each other again and both being available, it exploded into such a strong, dynamic *relationship*. And i know most of the other relationships He'd had before me were a D/s nature...  So maybe He's just needy physically - and found someone to fulfill that. But i also don't think it's over.  However, i can't talk with Him...i'm taking His lead right now. He called me Tuesday afternoon, told me what He had to, talked with me till work issues intervened, said He'd get in touch later on, and i haven't even gotten a text. That's what hurts and that's why i feel so pathetic for wanting Him back, because it was a dump-and-run, and He KNOWS how completely committed i'd been to Him.   But if He gets in touch, i'll see if the discussion goes that way. This is all so new for me, being without Him after 7 straight years of belonging to Him and obeying Him.  (But between you and me and everyone else...if He ends up unhappy...i will get more than a little satisfaction...is that bad? *s*)  Thank you for your thoughts. ☺",☺

t5_2qstm,coopdude,1343921032,"[https://creditcards.chase.com/freedom/FAQ.aspx](https://creditcards.chase.com/freedom/FAQ.aspx)  &gt;Merchants who accept Visa/MasterCard credit cards are assigned a merchant code based on the kinds of products and services they sell. Chase groups similar merchant codes into categories for purposes of making rewards offers to you. Chase makes every effort to include all relevant merchant codes in its listed categories. **However, even though a merchant or the items that it sells may appear to fit within a listed category, the merchant may not have a merchant code that falls within that category. Therefore, purchases with that merchant will not qualify for the stated rewards offer on category purchases**.  If you log into chase.com you should be able to see the pending transaction (and many issuers let you see the merchant code too so you can see how it is categorized; for example, [on one of my credit card sites (not Chase)](http://i.imgur.com/KCSbJ.jpg).  If it somehow passes as gas instead of some advertising services code (what Google has *traditionally used*) I'd be pleasantly surprised. However, using the merchant category code is standard for cashback - the fact that Google is warning you may not get it seems to point towards them not passing it along.  Every issuer I've had has had merchant code as the way to determine category cashback. If you confirm any exceptions, I'd be surprised - and happy to edit my post to reflect it accordingly.   [From Discover](https://www.discover.com/credit-cards/cashback-bonus/cashback-calendar-it.html):  &gt;Sign up to earn 5% Cashback Bonus for gas (at stand alone gas stations), movies and admission to theme parks from 7/1/12 (or the date on which you sign up, whichever is later) through 9/30/12, subject to a cap of $1,500 in purchases. Movie ticket and movie rental purchases are those made at merchants classified as movie theaters, video rental stores, online movie ticket and movie rental services. **If a purchase is coded for a category other than those listed above, it will not qualify.** These purchases must post to your account by 9/30/12. Purchases made at warehouse clubs, wholesale distributors, or discount stores are not eligible. Rewards are added to your Cashback Bonus account at the end of your billing period. See Cashback Bonus Program Terms and Conditions for further details.  [Amex Blue Cash](https://web.aexp-static.com/us/content/pdf/cardmember-agreements/blue-cash/BlueCashAECB.pdf)  &gt;**You will NOT receive reward dollars for everyday purchases if a merchant does not submit the purchase using the correct industry or merchant code**. A merchant with more than one location may submit purchases using different codes. This means that purchases at some locations would receive a higher reward, while purchases at other locations of the same merchant would receive a lower or no reward.  [Penfed Rewards Visa (5% at any US gas station paid at pump)](https://www.penfed.org/Platinum-Cash-Rewards/)  &gt;**Visa® USA determines which transactions are classified as gas purchases paid at the pump and supermarket purchases based on Merchant Category Codes**  [Citi](https://www.accountonline.com/ACQ/DisplayPage?docId=CompleteDetailsPop&amp;sc=46EZGW71901Z000000W&amp;app=UNSOL&amp;siteId=CB&amp;langId=EN&amp;BUS_TYP_CD=CONSUMER&amp;DOWNSELL_LEVEL=2&amp;BALCON_SC=&amp;B=V&amp;DOWNSELL_BRANDS=V,VV&amp;DOWNSELL_BRANDS=V,V,&amp;DownsellSourceCode1=46EZHW51901Z000000W&amp;B1=V&amp;DownsellSourceCode2=46EZIWL1901Z000000W&amp;B2=V&amp;t=t&amp;d=&amp;uc=BDX&amp;AMEX_PID_AF_CODE=&amp;AAPID) (**Citi cards that were eligible for this should be stored on device** and thus the proxied mastercard wouldn't be used. Thus, the Forward **should** get proper cashback. **The only reason I offer this excerpt is to support that the MCC is used to determine cashback rates**.)  &gt;**We do not determine whether merchants appropriately identify all transactions you make on your Card Account, but we do reserve the right to determine which purchases qualify for ThankYou Points.**  Point is, the MCC is the standard code used. If Google has somehow gotten the networks to agree to let them pass on the code - great.

t5_2tnz9,miggyb,1343947825,"""Party of One"" centers around one character and doesn't really give the True My Little Pony Experience™. It seems to be a favorite episode of a lot of people, but there's also a lot of people who hate that one particular character.  ""The Cutie Mark Chronicles"" gives a general overview of all the characters, but at 22 minutes it might actually be too brief and feel like throwing-shit-at-the-wall-to-see-what-sticks to a newcomer.  Personally, I'd recommend any of the two-part episodes to get a good feel of what it's generally about. I started right at the beginning and don't regret it, it set a good foundation of what to expect from the show and the main characters and their flaws.  Caveat: While the show is often congratulated for not being written exclusively for ""little girls,"" make no mistake, that *is* their target audience. If, for example, you're someone who feels too homosexually gay to enjoy a good game of [Robot Unicorn Attack](http://games.adultswim.com/robot-unicorn-attack-twitchy-online-game.html) or listen to some tasteful [estrogen-inducing Eurodance](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozmTO4AXroI), you're probably going to feel castrated 10 minutes into an episode.  If you're a masochist or if you're really really curious about it but just need to be eased in, then I recommend going the [4chan](http://boards.4chan.org/mlp/) route and starting with the [ironic fanmade stuff](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGiBycxRNL4) and working your way down.  Edit: Don't click the ""ironic fanmade stuff"" link unless you want your YouTube ""suggested videos"" to be completely raped for the next two or three weeks (or forever).

t5_2qh2p,Dudesan,1343957692,"Remember, many Christians find it more comfortable to believe in a god who doesn't condone, command or commit murder, slavery, rape, child abuse, animal abuse, arson, torture, ritual mutilation, fratricide, patricide, matricide, infanticide, genocide, and so on than to believe in one who does. Unfortunately, since the Bible (Old Testamant and New) is pretty clear about Yahweh's position on these things, holding a belief in Loving Hippie Jesus™ requires ignoring huge portions of it. Or just never reading it in the first place, which seems to be the most popular option.  Well, let's say what Jesus has to say about that:  &gt;“Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished.  (Matthew 5:17-18, NIV)  Some Christians claim that his death and resurrection ""fulfill"" this. That is bullshit for one simple reason: last time I checked, Heaven and Earth haven't passed away.  Jesus also made his views on people ""picking and choosing"" quite clear:  &gt;[Jesus] answered them, “And why do you break God’s commandment because of your tradition? For God said:    *Honor your father and your mother;* and, *The one who speaks evil of father or mother must be put to death.*  &gt; But you say, ‘Whoever tells his father or mother, “Whatever benefit you might have received from me is a gift committed to the temple”—  he does not have to honor his father.’ In this way, you have revoked God’s word because of your tradition. Hypocrites! Isaiah prophesied correctly about you when he said:    &gt;These people honor Me with their lips, but their heart is far from Me.  They worship Me in vain, teaching as doctrines the commands of men.”  (Matthew 15:3-9, NIV)   Looks like Jesus has quite a bit to say about people who ignore commandments, in fact. But maybe it's just Matthew?  &gt;It is easier for heaven and earth to disappear than for the least stroke of a pen to drop out of the Law.  (Luke 16:17, NIV)  Okay, so Jesus is a bust. Let's see what the Epistles have to say about the Mosaic Code:  &gt; If you really keep the royal law found in Scripture, “Love your neighbor as yourself,” you are doing right.  But if you show favoritism, you sin and are convicted by the law as lawbreakers. For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it.   (James 2:8-10, NIV)  &gt;All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness,  (2 Timothy 3:16)  &gt;Do we, then, nullify the law by this faith? Not at all! Rather, we uphold the law.  (Romans 3:31)  &gt;Know this first of all, that *there is no prophecy of scripture that is a matter of personal interpretation*, for no prophecy ever came through human will; but rather human beings moved by the holy Spirit spoke under the influence of God.""  (2 Peter 1:20-21 NAB) ",™

t5_2s7k2,ThunderCatsH0,1343986727,"Salam and peace to everyone,  Couldn’t hold myself back after reading your post, being a redditor for about 2 weeks figured I should join the fun.  This is my first post and hopefully I can shed some light for you.  FYI – I too was an atheist for some part of my life, I also looked into other religions and made myself believe I was a Christian to see if any miracle would happen or some divine vision would come through perhaps Jesus himself but nothing happened at all.  I spent countless days, weeks, months and years figuring out what I was looking for.  (does that even make sense ? lol)  It’s natural for us to question and ask things, especially with the inner self and be true to those thoughts with rational reasons behind every logic.    I’ve read countless books, including the gospels, bibles, torah, quran, vedas, ramayan, etc…  and I read in depth not skimming through per say.    To begin I believe being an atheist is very important, in Islam that is.  It is part of the sha ha dah where one can become a muslim.  Just a sentence without baptizing or doing anything fancy of that sort.  The saying is La ilaha illAllah which means “There is NO GOD” “BUT GOD”.    Firstly I would like to congratulate everyone on this board in saying the 75% of the complete sentence to become a muslim.  Let’s focus on your questions.  I will not answer anything I do not have knowledge of as it’s strictly forbidden in Islam.  1.	A true GOD did give everyone equal rights in which only they have complete control of to a certain extent.  Free will is also agreed upon in Islam where everyone has their own will to do as they please but God (Allah) knows everything.  Some might argue and say if God (Allah) knows everything we will be doing how is it fair on us as human beings?  Well I can give a clear cut example of this.  Imagine a teacher has a class who divides it into 3 and predicts that secion 1 will get all A’s, setion 2 will get all C’s and last but not least section 3 will get all F’s.  The students have spent only a few weeks/months at most with this teacher who has gotten to recognize their habits and performance at test levels making it that much easier for the teacher to predict the outcome.  The teacher doesn’t just FAIL section C in the very first few weeks even though the teacher knows that they are headed towards the wrong direction.  The teacher puts through till the very end leaving it all up to the student to decide what he/she needs to do to straighten up.   Bumping into characters of many different races or religions who may appeal you is very common.  I have bumped into a jew who wouldn’t even look at another woman and to my surprise he said it keeps me from committing sin.  I asked, “How so?!” He replied saying, “We are men, you know.”  I once came across a hindu who after getting into a car accident with a friend of mine gave him a ride home even though it was my friends fault and offered him advice on always being kind to others.  The list goes on but kindness and religion go hand in hand.  Islam is not just a religion but a a way of LIFE. 2.	I agree, that is why I only rely on the Quran not the hadith. 3.	Till this day I have yet to come across a book with phrases man just can’t think of.  Why is it hard to believe that the Quran is not the same that was revealed to him which he revealed to his companions.  Think about this for a second, how many songs do you remember that you can sing to?  1400 years ago with no television or radios this was very common.  It still amazes me how our Presidents of the USA were able and capable of writing the way they did.  Even the messages on the currency which has phrases that make sense even now in this modern world.  Men were extremely wise with words and poetic back in the days.  Quran is a book that contains words only sent by God (Allah) to his angel who then came to his messenger like he did to the others and recited it.  The very first word revealed to Muhammad by the angel was “Iqra” which means “READ!”  “How can I read” said Muhammad. Angel responded again saying “READ”.  I believe the word READ is very important in this life.  Without reading we will go astray and not be able to do anything in this world to the point where we are now. You need to focus 100% on Muhammad not the caliphs or companions.  They come later in the game and are no where near as important as the prophets have been.  It would be unfair for God (Allah) to send us books and expect mankind to follow it without having an example.  It would be like taking the SAT’s without going through school with your teachers and having hands on experience.  The proof is all around us even now. Go talk to any muslim, he/she will know of many who have memorized the entire Quran.  All 114 chapters.  The miracle of the Quran is that if all holy books in the world were thrown in the ocean within a matter of hours the Quran can be reproduced because millions remember it in the ORIGINAL authentic manner it was revealed.  Even the dot of a period will be where it belongs.  If people hundreds of years later can memorize it with WAY more to memorize now days then anything else then back then it was a piece of cake.   4.	The Prophet married many woman but most were for political gains and reasons.  I’ve read many books about this issue but you have to keep in mind.  On Earth the most books written AGAINST any human is Muhammad.  It’s like going to the eastern side of the world (China.Russia, Arab countries) and reading how bad of a president bush was.  Unfortunately many people think of Muhammad as a pedophile without truly reading about him from the muslim side of view.   5.	Agreed.  He taught people to love and live.  At his time a church can be built as long as it wasn’t higher then the mosque.  Also they were required to pay taxes which was completely fair.  It’s only after his death where the fanatics took over. 6.	God (Allah) is not in on anything.  He knows everything we don’t know or can ever understand.  Obviously for Satan to disobey the angel and go against Gods (Allah’s) will was something he already knew and had planned for.  Anything we do is for a purpose, without it there is no purpose. 7.	In the Quran we are his creations.  It’s like the President of a company.  Imagine yourself being the owner of Google/Ebay/Facebook.  You are the SHIT. You are the real deal. You are the one.  You don’t do everything yourself, you have regional managers, district managers, area managers, store managers, etc. etc..   God (Allah) has gifted us by giving us the opportunity to s\erve him… afterwards you get rewarded ☺   8.	In Islam the biggest sin you can commit is put or associate anything with or next to God (Allah).  In the Quran it says our knowledge in this world as to what lies in the heavens is as if you dipped your finger in the ocean. Earth can fit a million times in our Sun.  There is a star called (arakanadin) ←def spelled wrong but its 5 million times bigger then our star Then comes beetle juice which is 300 times larger then that star... then comes the VY star, a BILLION times bigger then our sun.  This just stuff they have found so far… way more out there we can’t even see.  This gives you an idea of how Great your BIG your lord is.  We can’t even compare it to a dot in the ocean let alone the universe.  We as human beings can’t comprehend or have the capabilities of understanding how he is or what he looks like.  Moses if you recall requested to see him, he passed out from the brightness alone.  As a gift God (Allah) will let his creatures see him in paradise. Based on what the Quran says he is ONE and is alone.  Just like you can’t question your president of a company you can’t question that either.  9.	Muhammad is how God (Allah) want us to be like.  Humble, giving, smiling, kind, etc..  He set forth an example for mankind to follow.  He taught not to sleep without knowing your neighbours next door are sleeping with full stomach.  About 2 years ago our neighbours lost their house in a fire, not only did we shelther them but provided them food and living for 4 months.  They were Christians and were welcome to practice their faith away from ours. It was his teachings that let us do that other wise we wouldn’t have.  It is the month of Ramadan, I am giving charity (big chunk of it) to the poor.  I have many businesses in the wireless retail side of which I have to give portions of to the needy including my properties and and gold/silver sitting anywhere including money sitting in bank that hasn’t been touched to the needy.  If every muslim gave charity like they are suppose to there will be no hungry families going to bed at night.  The list goes on… how is this bad or evil?   10.	The Quran describes the birth of Jesus better then any book I’ve read.  The difference is it says it was the “WORD” of God (Allah) that impregnated Mary not the holy ghost or a part of God.  He said, “BE” and there he was.  ",☺

Talking to the enemy in EQ *HUMANIZED* pvp, and made it not only more rewarding, but more entertaining and engaging. Hell, some of best friends made in EQ were people I fought against in PVP. In WoW, that wasn't an option. 50% of the player base was segmented off from me, unable to chat / talk / discuss the fight we had, be it to give props or curse them out for ganking you low-life after killing a mob. On top of that, ""cross-teaming"" (aka grouping with players or guild(s) from another team) in EQ PVP added an extra meaty level of drama and diplomacy that forged alligences and mortal enemies that lasted for the duration of some guild's lifespans (and even beyond, spilling over into post-EQ-playing forum posts in small Zek forum communities still active to this very day!)...

This is the night and day difference that 99% of the Zek veterans will tell you regarding WoW (""modern-day"") PVP in MMOS vs. what EQ did right: They fail by instancing Dungeons/Raids away from PVP harm (and perhaps even instance the PVP, as well).  **When you let people have their own safe and fully-respawned instance of a dungeon on a PVP server you IMMEDIATELY kill world PVP.**  Everquest got it right, though not thanks to design, but instead due to tech limits. Server tech wasn't beefy enough in Vanilla EQ days to allow for mass-instancing of dungeons / raids on TOP of world zones already pushing the servers running each zone to the risk of crashing.  No, instead in EQ, EVERYTHING, from the best dungeons to level in, to the most badass dragon to slay for loot, required/forced you to fight your way INTO a zone (PVP). Once in you then must fight your way TO the boss (PVE). After all that, you STILL have to keep watch for enemy  guilds on opposing teams trying to rush the zone before re-pops to catch up to &amp; kill your raid before you can take down the currently respawned boss you seek.  **If you instance PVE, people have nothing to fight for in world PVP**, aside from griefing lowbies / ganking the occasional enemy you come across.   **Likewise, if you instance PVP, the thrill of unexpected player battles is lost**; the rush of knowing your levelling spot is something you may have to fight to keep since there's enemy teams in the same zone, and the randomness / uniqueness of PVP is made into some boring, automatically set-up / forced player vs. player assembly line activity.   **INSTANCING DUNGEONS, BOSSES, AND/OR PVP -- ON A PVP SERVER ESPECIALLY! -- IS TERRIBLE FOR PVP/THE PVP SERVER AS A WHOLE.**   Before anyone comments, yes of course it's less technically stresful / easier to instance content these days- I get that, I do. But you might as well not have PVP servers if you instance the raid content away from pvp / make it safe from pvp.  ^`  **DON'T INSTANCE DUNGEONS/RAIDS AWAY FROM PVP**, *please* Smed... don't do this. Please. Please * infinity^+^1. :)  ^`  **So there's my ~~plea~~** wall of text, haha. I'm a day late so chances are you'll never see this regardless, but I had to take the chance to talk directly to the man who can make or break EQNext PVP for the old-school EQ Zek vets. :)  Honestly, I was completely uninterested in the project until I heard you finally managed to re-assimilate Brad McQuaid into the Smed-Borg collective at SOE.   *He is McQuaidus of Smorg, magic resistance is futile.*  I've always believed in Brad's MMO philosophy (*The Vision*™), despite the shock and disappointment that was Vanguard's launch disaster / Sigil's death, simply due to the years of PVP memories old-school EQ delivered for me &amp; my friends. Not to mention, the legacy Vanilla/Kunark/Velious EQ / EQ pvp left can **STILL** be felt daily on the EQ forums with people posting pleas for Vanilla/Kunark/Velious classic servers; His work (with help from Trost &amp; Clover, without question) from SISA to 989 to Verant, Brad's Vision™ was consistent throughout all dev team changes.  (I know he's working closely with the Vanguard team to accomplish the goals and hopes he had for the game in Sigil's days, but I'm sure his input is welcomed and desired in EQNext's design... he's a chef that you can't afford NOT to have in the SOE kitchen. He may have lacked the resources and team at Sigil to win MMO Iron Chef, but Brad + SOE has yet to fail with the cake they bake.  ^`  Mmm, *cake*. Wait, what was I posting about again?  ^`   **But really, thanks for hopefully reading, Mr. Smedley**, and for all the fun this last decade+ has brought to me and my friends from SOE/Everquest/Planetside) :)",™

At that point it becomes Value City™ as you sac your Wellsprings/Solemns to draw answers and tutor up more lands, wipe the board with Mutilate and eventually drop your bomb or dig in with a Nighthawk or two.

This could be a professional organization, sports league, hobby group, what have you.  [Meetup.com](http://meetup.com) is a good place to be introduced to large numbers of people with similar interests.  From there you can determine who, if anyone, has the characteristics you'd want to pursue in a relationship.  * Know what you want, and don't be afraid to fail.  If you want a guy and you think you're compatible, go after it.  To succeed twice as much you have to fail ten times as much.  * You sound intelligent, and if you're as pretty as people™ say you are then you already have a leg up.  Confidence is key in many successful relationships, so investing in yourself and your self worth are always good choices.  * Let things happen.  The more you try to force something, the more force will be applied in return.  I know it sucks being single, but looking too hard for the one or trying to make something happen usually leaves you overextended and offbalance.  &gt;Even with my best guy friends, I'm seen as ""the girl next door"" or ""one of the guys"".  This is what I do when I like you but don't want to damage or lose the relationship.  I'm fairly confident I can successfully have sex with any number of women on any given day, but good friendships are few and far between.  And once you cross the boundary of friendship, it's nearly impossible (for me) to go backwards if the romantic relationship fails.  There's an element of risk you can't eliminate in crossing that threshold, and I'd rather keep you firmly in the camp of friendship, love, and comfort than in the dangerous realm of misreading your intentions and ruining a friendship.  Edit:  Or they just have no romantic interest in you.  For me, having a close female friend who I find attractive can mean the transition between friendship and romance is easier.  I have close female friends who are attractive and who I care for very much, but who I think would be incompatible in a romantic relationship, and so they remain friends.",™

If I'm understanding correctly, he doesn't care if their child takes part so long as his wife and other believers don't tell the child that ""this is the One True Way ™"" and allow her to make her own decisions.  Note: Not saying his wife would, just that this is a worry non-believers could reasonably be expected to hold.  You're correct that sharing isn't terrible, but the key word there is ""sharing""; if it starts slipping into ""this is how it is period-end-of-discussion,"" or if parental authority is used to compel the practice, there's a problem.  Why is empiricism passive aggressive? That's just a way of looking at the world that demands proof. If the child decides she doesn't want / need physical-world proof (she comes to believe that the divine transcends our reality or something), then it isn't a problem. Atheists and other non-believers don't hold that particular belief, and so deny the existence of supernatural (in the literal sense) gods and godesses based on empirical evidence. And that's OK because that's how they see the world.  Final bit? The child may already have the ability to observe, quantify and rationalize as an inborn human trait, but having a parent who can share with them the beautiful complexity of our universe in-and-of-itself (that is to say, ""only"" what can be observed, touched etc) is a gift to be cherished. He or she can teach them that it is OK to question what they hear / see, praise them for being inquisitive and, if the child so chooses, help them come to terms with being a moral person in a world that lacks a divinely ordained ""Good."" Could a religious individual teach these same things? Potentially, but you do atheist / non-believer parents an awful disservice by claiming that they ""literally have nothing to share but what the kids already got"" [sic].   TL;DR?

The QR code can be scanned using the ParkNOW! app, available for free at iTunes, Android Market, and soon the Blackberry App World. The cell phone payment is communicated to the IPS smart meter, which turns on exactly as if the payment was made on the spot with coins or credit card. Mobile NOW has a patent pending on the solution.  QR (Quick Response) code is a 2-dimensional bar code developed by Denso Inc. A QR code is readable by dedicated QR barcode readers and camera phones. The code consists of black modules arranged in a square pattern on a white background. The information encoded can be text, URL or other data.

t5_2qhk3,ExpendableOne,1344025449,"1. Feminism, in all of its forms, is this concept of equality that stems from and relies on the false premise that women are unilaterally oppressed by men and that men are unilaterally privileged and actively working as a collective to oppress women. There are some who take this premise to extremes and others who don't but the result if generally the same.  At the end of the day, the history speaks for itself and all you're left with a very biased movement claiming to hold on a monopoly on the topic of equality without ever actually doing anything for men and that is driven by male exclusion, misandry(much of with those feminists aren't even willing to acknowledged or acknowledge their complacency in perpetuating it), female chauvinism and gender bullying(like the old ""either you're a feminist or you hate women"" fallacy). Feminism is not just a movement that has always, first and foremost, exclusively fought for female interests(even when they were at the expense of men) but it is a movement that still, to this day, fails to truly acknowledged or deal with male suffering and most forms of gender inequality that benefit women and that refuses to step aside to make room for fairer, more balance, gender egalitarian movements that don't prioritize women above all else the way they believe women are entitled to.   2. Why is this concept of rape culture so heavily perpetuated while this culture of violence towards men is not only far more rampant but actually cause far more harm to men than rape does to women.  Why is rape, a crime that is far less severe than most forms of violence(sexual or non-sexual), still considered to be ""worse"" or more shocking, and warrants more attention(if not simply because of this belittling misconception that it exclusively affects women), than all the forms of violence which predominantly affect men?  Why is it okay for feminists to perpetuate and exploit this misconception that only women can be raped and that only men rape?  3.  This question is pretty generic, as there many specific issues to address and far too many ways in which men are hurt, marginalized or disadvantaged in society. The first major steps would be to promote genuine gender equality, in all aspects of life(whether it's romance/dating, working the hard/shit jobs, expecting women to not only be self reliant but also be willing to support men the way men have historically been expected to do for women, rejecting these social notions of male vilification and/or exclusion, promoting fairness in the courtroom and in the home), and promoting a fair and human treatment of men in general(kind of sad that it has to be emphasized that men should be recognized feeling, breathing and living human beings).    4.  There are countless ways in which men are stereotyped, demonized and belittled. Whether it's creep shaming, being labelled as doormats or ""nice guy™"" for being heterosexual while shy, introverted or insecure(insecurities which are completely forgiven and compensated for in women), that every male is malevolent by default, and that's just scratching the surface. For the record though, no one is ""fat because they play video games"", plenty of healthy, skinny and/or athletic men and women play video games, and ""slut shaming"" is essentially an extenuation of male sexual vilification(what is slut shamming, really, if not simply women penalizing other women for not living up to the general status quo of male repulsion/belittlement).   5. stop calling yourself a feminist. Call yourself a women's rights activist or call yourself an egalitarian but, at the very least, recognize that your relentlessness in adopting this label of ""feminist"" is nothing more than an shallow gesture of female solidarity(which is in of itself, inherently sexist) and a reluctance to change and progress.  Until you realize that ""feminism"", regardless of how you may choose to idolize it, is actually part of the problem, you aren't really in a position to deal with those issues.  6. A bit of both. I have yet to meet any feminist that wasn't personally bigoted or biased against men in one way or another, which I am willing to accept as anecdotal experience, but it is certainly hard to ignore the amount of bigotry that is not only inherent and fundamental to feminism itself but also completely widespread in feminism and society(social anti-male bigotry that is also largely ignored or, worse, presented as a plight for women by feminism).  It is, however, completely ignorant to ignore the harm that feminism has caused historically and still continues to cause or to try to project this idea that feminism is about equality(essentially glorifying a word, and by extension a movement, that has no right being glorified), when it clearly isn't.    7. They weren't. Women have always been a major influence on both social outcomes and on the men that drove them. Women have always been, since the beginning of human history, the privileged and protected gender. Women have always had sexual, social and emotional power over men, and have historically been provided for in nearly every way by men, while never having to be held responsible for the many atrocities that they themselves created, perpetuated or participated in.  Looking back throughout all of human history, men have suffered and died considerably more so then women ever have(It seems that for every woman that is raped, there has been at least two men humiliated, beaten, tortured and/or murdered), and this is all swept under the rug to please and appease women, or protect them from such inconvenient truths.  Male expandability and female pandering is and has always been a major part of basic human nature and not only has feminism completely ignored this fact when establishing their movement/ideology but they still continue to exploit it to promote their movement/interests.   8. A lot of people might not agree or simply think that a lot of these behaviors cannot be changed, but I am completely against all gender roles and expectations, especially the ones that are far from innate or who are superficial in nature. Men shouldn't be expected to pay for dates, nor should they be expected to die just to keep a woman slightly more convenient or safer.  I don't believe in separating any kind of public or social establishment by gender(including sports and/or washrooms), and I don't believe in holding men and women to different standards.  ",™

t5_2cneq,xiipaoc,1344028897,"You must not be a True Republican™ then, because No True Republican™ would support Barack Obama!  I'm only half-joking.  The Republican establishment has positioned itself squarely against Obama and intelligent thought, which is strange because Obama is really, really, really not that liberal.  Single-payer healthcare might be on the left side of things, though it's not far-left by any means, but Obamacare is almost completely a center-right system, but since it's got Obama in the name, True Republicans™ hate it.  The bigotry on gay marriage is really nothing but homophobia, and any intelligent and moral person should see it as an essential human rights issue, but because of a hard-wired knee-jerk reaction to gayness, True Republicans™ are squarely against it.  Then we have a lot of things that only stupid fundies want, like teaching religion (creationism, specifically) in schools, but the Republican establishment can't be much against it because they'd risk alienating their base.  Basically, True Republicans™ must oppose Obama in every possible way in order to convince people to elect Republicans instead of Democrats.  It can't be, ""well, Obama's all right, but we disagree with him on this and that""; it has to be ""Obama's COMPLETELY EVIL AND MUST BE STOPPED AT ALL COSTS"".  So it's completely unsurprising that some conservatives have not accepted True Republicanism™ and choose to stick to their values even when they're espoused by a Democrat.  Principled conservatives and principled liberals agree on a lot of stuff, but the Republican establishment has made agreeing with a Democrat some sort of scarlet letter.  It's great that you're bridging that gap.  Funny thing is, I think Romney himself would be in your position if he weren't running for president as a Republican.  I don't know what his true positions are, and nobody else does, either, but before he started running for president, he was very much on the pragmatic side of Republicanism rather than the dogmatic anti-Democrat side.  These two huge issues, gay marriage and universal health care, were both instituted in Massachusetts under his governorship, making Massachusetts actually lead the way on both fronts.  I want everyone in the country to have the quality of health care coverage I get as a Massachusetts resident through Romneycare.  I really don't think Romney would have been a terrible choice had he not switched all his positions.",™

t5_2qh1i,waubers,1344031043,"I was 17 and a month away from graduating from High School and on a random Friday night I had planned to have some friends over for a bon fire.  This was a pretty typical thing on weekend evenings.  On this particular Friday evening, my mother had made lasagna (SCORE!) for dinner, but it was my job to bake it when I got home since I was usually home by 3:00pm. Mom usually didn't get home until after 6:00 as she had a pretty long commute.    My Dad had finished working that day, and met some of his friends at a local tavern (bar to you non-Wisconsinites).  He called my mom at work and asked her to meet him and pick him up, as he had had a few. Mom called me and told me that she'd be home a little late because she was getting Dad.  So, I bake the lasagna, and when it's done have a piece, loosely cover it with foil and throw it back in the oven, and turn the oven down to 175F to keep it warm.  Figure this was about 6:00pm, so I assumed my parents would be home within a half hour.  About this time my friends start arriving for the bon fire.  I get distracted getting the fire going and the chairs set up and beverages in the coolers and what not, typical stuff.  I didn't realize it, but it was coming up on 7:30 before it dawned on my that my parents weren't home yet.  I head in the house, and turn off the oven, figuring they decided to stay out a bit, which usually results in them eating out.  11:00pm and I've now got probably 20 people hanging out, pretty good mix of guys and girls, chatting, roasting marshmallows, playing Sheepshead, being stupid, generally having a good time.  11:15pm and I see my Mom's car pull in the driveway. Next thing I hear the door of the car slam and I can tell Mom is pissed off.  Then I hear some yelling come from my Dad.  Not good.  I figured they were having another drunkfight©    The last years of my being in high school were marked with a massive increase in my parents drinking.  During that time I pretty much took care of my brother and just tried to stay under the radar of my Father.  I understand what happened very well now, but at the time I just kind of hated my Dad, at least when he was drinking, and cared more about shielding my brother from their shit than anything else.  Oh, and Magic: The Gathering, I cared about that a lot too...and seeing boobs.  What happened next wasn't pretty.  After Dad went inside yelling after Mom, I headed for the back door to our house to try to calm things down (a pretty typical thing I had to do).  I was greeted to my Father swearing at my Mom and calling her lazy and stupid and other unpleasant things.  My Mom was trying to ignore him and not embarass the family by having a huge argument with a yard full of people to hear it.  Before I said anything, she asked me where the lasagna was, I told her in the oven.    **Dad: ""What?  You left it in the fucking oven?  Why the fuck did you do that?  Are you stupid?  You fucking disgust me, you fucking lazy spoiled brat.  You're so fucking smart, why the fuck do you even need to live here?  Get you shit and get out, I don't want to see your face here ever again.  GET THE FUCK OUT!  I MEAN IT, YOU AREN'T SLEEPING HERE TONIGHT!""**  **At this point he grabbed my backpack (which had a laptop in it, that I bought with my own money...this was in 2000 so it was like $3k to replace) and thew all my stuff out the back door, while continuing to verbally berate me and my Mom.**  I started laughing, from the absurdity of his behavior, which just pissed him off even more.  I said, ""Fuck this"" and headed out the back door, checked my labtop for damage (it was okay) and grabbed my backpack.  I headed toward the fire and was intercepted by a couple of my closest friends asking what was going on.  I just told them my Dad was being an asshole and asked if I could crash by one of them, which they agreed to.  So, in 15 or so seconds, I went from being a non-speaking person in an argument to the biggest disappointment in my fathers existence and being kicked out of the house, near as I can tell, for him thinking I dried out the lasagna by leaving it in the oven.  Later that night, after my dad passed out, my Mother found me by the fire and told me I didn't have to stay somewhere else and apologized for him being the way he was.  I just told her that ""It's not your fault he's an asshole when he's drunk, and I wish you would just leave him""  She started tearing up and wend back to the house.  The following morning he had no recollection of what he said or did (or he just didn't want to have one).  Oddly, that pissed me off more than anything else.  I went to work and just downloaded a bunch of shit on Napster over my company's T1.  The following two weeks I finished up planning my college selection and housing.  I finally spoke to him when I told him I was going to be leaving for college in August and living on campus.  **tl;dr: Father kicked me out of the house because he was drunk and thought I overcooked the lasagna.**",©

I tried Burt's bees w/ NovaMin &amp; w/ flouride for a while, no difference (two tubes over months and I brush daily).  I still get cavities and my teeth still look weak and not-perfectly-white either.  Basically dentistry is an exhausted and slow field where nothing has changed since flouride---except for those who want to dish out thousands for whitening, veneers, cosmetic dentistry, and/or they have a dentist nice enough to prescribe them the good stuff that is actually effective at high dosages.  In fact, most toothpaste in America has such low amounts of flouride ( I guess due to fear of children swallowing toothpaste), it doesn't even make a difference.   I don't even eat anything with sugar really except on rare occasions. I don't drink any sodas or sugary anything. Still, every time you go to the dentist, ""oh looks like you might get periodontal disease soon™"" ""oh look there's another cavity."" ""Oh on the x-ray I say a microscopic crack on your teeth, better dish out another $500 because your awesome highest-rated insurance company won't pay for you unless you get mercury in your teeth which no dentist carries anymore due to health risks.""  Back on the subject, my dentist gave me sodium-flouride toothpaste that has high concentration (prescription), but they gave me such a small tube, because I dunno, they are afraid of chemicals or want to rob me some more.  Then they wonder why people don't go to the dentist.",™

t5_2qm6c,liloloaaloha,1344051667,"A few months ago, I had a dream about a very specific crochet pattern.  Two strands of [Lion Brand Homespun yarn](http://www.lionbrand.com/yarns/homespun.htm) held together, big ol' fatty hook (in this case N15 10mm size) and just double crochets, back and forth.  In my dream, it felt like one of the luxury blankets that sell for like $500, and when I finished the throw, it kinda did, at only a fraction of the price -- you can find the yarn at Wal-Mart for like $4.75 a skein.   Hope you guys enjoy it!  Here's the pattern, if anyone is interested:  10-12 skeins Lion Brand Homespun yarn - I used the color Regency N15 10mm hook   Chain 153 loosely, holding two strands together.  DC in 4th ch from hook, cont to dc across to last ch.  Ch 3. Turn.  Skipping first dc of last row, dc across to last dc, ending with dc on top of the ch3 turn.  Cont until you reach the size throw you want, or until you have only 2 skeins left.    Border:  At the end of last row, start working down the edge of throw, sc evenly until you reach the end.  Work 3 sc in corner to turn, cont to sc along bottom edge.  Cont with same pattern - sc evenly along the edges, with 3 sc in corners to turn - until beginning of border.  Join with sl st.  Finish off.   Hope everyone enjoys this!  Aloha ♥  ",♥

t5_2qq65,gedvondur,1344056451,"Full text of the announcement.  Got this in my email today. FYI Scotchit.  Hello U.S. Friends,  It gives me great pleasure to inform you that this year’s edition of Laphroaig® Cáirdeas Scotch Whisky has finally arrived! It’s aptly named “Origin,” because it contains whisky from our very first batch of Cáirdeas.  This whisky is now between 13 and 21 years old. We blended it (50:50) with another ‘special’ whisky we had been quietly maturing. This new spirit was then placed into small quarter casks, enjoying a very intense maturation for seven years. Both whiskies were fine expressions of Laphroaig® in their own right, but when blended together something exceptional emerged as befits this 18th anniversary.  It is 51.2%ABV strength and non-chill filtered, and as I’m sure you can imagine, tastes just wonderful. Here are the notes:  Nose: With a nose that constantly evolves and is full of flavour, Cáirdeas Origin begins with a quick hint of concentrated orange moving quickly into huge peat flavours, ashy, dusty with hazelnut. It becomes crisp and fresh with cold green apples, grapes and finishing with a fresh cut grassy flavour.  Palate: The flavours evolve slowly on the palate and with great body it begins with white pepper moving into an earthy peaty flavour, some slight salt then purple heather. Huge creamy apricots that last and last, and it ends with some charred damp wood.  Cáirdeas Origin is a very rare, special expression of Laphroaig® Scotch Whisky, with limited quantities in the U.S. So, without any further adieu, below are the markets where this exclusive expression should be available. Please check with your local retailers in these markets for dates of availability.

Ignoring it means doing business as usual until fossil fuels are no longer economical.  Maybe it's natural variation.  Things change.  We're smart, we can probably handle it.  The poor will bear the brunt but such is capitalism.  Luck of the genetic draw.

t5_2qh1i,SchoenBach,1344060749,"My story isn't particularly interesting, but whatever: we met when I was a junior in college, and he was a freshman (so that was 4 years ago). I really didn't know him that well and only met him through our mutual friend. We talked a few, but we really didn't start hanging out and getting close until spring term. The more I got to know him, the more I realized we have many things in common (i.e. we have similar tastes in music and the arts, political viewpoints, etc.), and to me, it was such a relief to finally find someone who I can empathize with and confide in.  And even though we had been best friends in college, we really did **NOT** spend much time together. Both of us had completely different groups of friends (he was with his frat friends, and I my international friends), but we ALWAYS decided to meet up super late at night at the park by the campus and smoked a pack of Djarums and had super in-depth discussions of things. In a way, the whole not-seeing-each-other-for-the-whole-day-until-3am really worked out for us (because we would never be sick of each other).  And so, I slowly developed feelings for him (**I caught the ghey**, btw...), and as we were walking around campus together, I said to him straight up: ""I really like you."" I was also probably inebriated when I spilled out my true feelings. He paused, and soon after laughed in disbelief, ""LOL, Jesus...... you're drunk."" Even though he rejected my drunken advancement (he's **straight**... durrr), we still remained close, and even closer than before.  It's not until near the end of my senior year where shit kind of hit the fan. He had trouble focusing in classes, things didn't work out with his degree, fucked up sleep schedule, and also rising tuition costs. And eventually he became depressed, and that's when I started to devote most of my time for him. We would always talk at our favorite fountain at 3am, vent our anger and frustration together, and huffed some more cloves.   But alas, things fell through, and he decided to drop out.  I was **FUCKING** devastated.  But I promised to myself that I would always keep in touch with him no matter what. He moved back to his hometown, and I just had to live with it (we still talked like a fiend on FB, but I was super sad that I lost my smoking buddy. I also quit smoking shortly after he left. Yay!). After I graduated in my super-senior year, I went on to do grad school in a nearby city. I talked with my friend on FB, and surprise, surprise: he was planning to move to the city with his friends!  ""OMG, I'll get to see my best friendskies again!"" I screamed in my mind.  I was absolutely overjoyed. When he moved in, we decided to meet up at a coffeehouse, and my he's changed. I had always known him as a fat chubby nerdy but adorable and mature kid, and now he's like a hot shot with haut-couture clothing, and ear piercings, etc. He told me that he's in a band and wants to see how far they will go. I got really excited for him, and I continued to support him.  Months later, they became, arguably, the best band in town (it's a big town, let's say, it's the capitol of a state). Got awesome reviews here and there, and their music is legit really, *really* good. Speaking as a music performance major, I can definitely attest to that.  Two nights ago, we chatted on FB, and he told me how everything, just, exploded in front of his eyes. And he told me about how everyone loves their music, etc. And naturally, I told him many times about how happy I am for him. After an hour of talking, he wrote me:  ""thanks for being the best friend in the world""  I then wrote, ""EEEEEEK! :3 CAN I PLZ QUOTE THIS? TEE HEE""  He ""LOL""'ed, then said ""i want to hug you.""  I think that might have been our **FIRST** open declaration of best-friendship in our **FOUR** years of camaraderie.   Before I went to bed, I updated my FB status: &gt;""thanks for being the best friend in the world"" - my best friend in the world :) ♥  tl;dr: **I FUCKING LOVE MY BEST FRIEND. FUCK YOU.**",♥

It was originally a way that effeminate men could be sold out of the slave trade for plantations, into the sex trade or sold as ""females"" to horny slave owners. The 5 pointed star was used as a marker to denote that they were for ""female use"" (the 5 points being the head, the arms and the legs) - a 6 pointed star was used if they were to be sold as men (the 6th point being the penis). Shortly after slavery ended, those with the ""badges"" got together and opened Brothels which specialised in transsexuals. They used the Star on the door or windows of the brothels to signify that it was a ""tranny"" house. The star became known as ""Espalhe a estrela aberta do sexo"".  &gt; In more recent times, it's become the marker of the tranny mafia group who kept the original name. Part gang, part prostitute union they pretty much control a lot of the travesti sex industry in Brazil and once your in, you have ""protection"" - for a fee of course, the tattoo is the prove that you are in the ""Union"". Wearing it without being accepted in the Union would have a punishment ranging from death, to full castration or acid thrown in the face (the last two disabling a TS from being a TS prositute).

It isn't as heavy on The Feels™, although it does have its moments, it has an amazing sound track-- it is a novel about a group of high school students forming a bad after all-- and it isn't overly long.  The only thing I don't really like about it is that it doesn't use a normal text box; which can make it a bit of a chore to read on some backgrounds while still being able to see them through the text box.  The other one I've read that I've really enjoyed since Katawa Shoujo but haven't finished off yet is Yume Miru Kusuri: A Drug That Makes You Dream. That one, at least on the one route that I have finished, was heart rending at times.   While it did have humor to break up some of the harsher moments, the end of the route I read just left me shocked at what your character tried to do. I won't spoil it here, but it was a good read.  This one also isn't without issues. It is far heavier on H-scenes than either Katawa Shoyjo or Kira☆Kira, with one of the three routes being little more than one H-scene leading into another.

t5_2snuc,koronicus,1344082021,"&gt;Were they all high functioning schizophrenics, who were somehow sane enough to hoodwink the masses while simultaneously misinterpreting that voices in their heads were the word of God?  Statistically, there have been a whole lot of humans throughout history. What percentage have started religions? Surely a smaller percentage than that of ""high functioning schizophrenics."" All you need to start a religion is one person (mentally ill or otherwise) who tells convincing stories and a credulous audience, then you can invent a religion. If the founder was lying, there's no way for anyone to find out after his (or her, but I notice that most cult leaders tend to be male) death. Never underestimate [the power of motivated reasoning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/When_Prophecy_Fails).  Heck, it gets even easier after religion already exists. Just look at the sheer number of Christian denominations. Each one of those was founded by someone who announced ""I have the true word of God, and all others are imposters/deceived/confused/etc."" When someone already has a vague belief in the supernatural, how hard is it to shape their beliefs by authoritatively explaining the *True™ secrets of the universe*? Most of these beliefs are by their very natures unfalsifiable, so how can you prove that the great creator god Sznobtar isn't whispering divine secrets into the ear of Her one true prophet? Like I said, all it takes is a credulous audience, and from there, the informal fallacy of [appeal to popularity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentum_ad_populum) can take over.",™

The lower pH of synthetic detergents, such as Cetaphil®, minimizes skin irritation and dryness [150,151]. In a small randomized trial, patients with moderate acne (treated with a benzoyl peroxide/erythromycin combination gel alone or combined with adapalene) were instructed to wash their faces with either a synthetic detergent bar (Dove® Sensitive Skin Bar) or soap [152]. After four weeks, the patients washing with the synthetic detergent bar exhibited less skin peeling, dryness, and irritation than those using soap.  &gt; [150] Draelos ZD.

Going to the hospital I was very out of it. On the verge of passing out. I think I almost died that day.   But yeah it makes you different. Because of the trauma I live a very ethical life. Treating everyone as equal and helping people that need helped. It makes me sick the acts of violence people can commit. I've learned to harness hate in a productive way.

t5_2qh2p,Dudesan,1344102738,"Remember, many Christians find it more comfortable to believe in a god who doesn't condone, command or commit murder, slavery, rape, child abuse, animal abuse, arson, torture, ritual mutilation, fratricide, patricide, matricide, infanticide, genocide, and so on than to believe in one who does. Unfortunately, since the Bible (Old Testamant and New) is pretty clear about Yahweh's position on these things, holding a belief in Loving Hippie Jesus™ requires ignoring huge portions of it. Or just never reading it in the first place, which seems to be the most popular option.  Well, let's say what Jesus has to say about that:  &gt;“Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished.  (Matthew 5:17-18, NIV)  Some Christians claim that his death and resurrection ""fulfill"" this. That is bullshit for one simple reason: last time I checked, Heaven and Earth haven't passed away.  Jesus also made his views on people ""picking and choosing"" quite clear:  &gt;[Jesus] answered them, “And why do you break God’s commandment because of your tradition? For God said:    *Honor your father and your mother;* and, *The one who speaks evil of father or mother must be put to death.*  &gt; But you say, ‘Whoever tells his father or mother, “Whatever benefit you might have received from me is a gift committed to the temple”—  he does not have to honor his father.’ In this way, you have revoked God’s word because of your tradition. Hypocrites! Isaiah prophesied correctly about you when he said:    &gt;These people honor Me with their lips, but their heart is far from Me.  They worship Me in vain, teaching as doctrines the commands of men.”  (Matthew 15:3-9, NIV)   Looks like Jesus has quite a bit to say about people who ignore commandments, in fact. But maybe it's just Matthew?  &gt;It is easier for heaven and earth to disappear than for the least stroke of a pen to drop out of the Law.  (Luke 16:17, NIV)  Okay, so Jesus is a bust. Let's see what the Epistles have to say about the Mosaic Code:  &gt; If you really keep the royal law found in Scripture, “Love your neighbor as yourself,” you are doing right.  But if you show favoritism, you sin and are convicted by the law as lawbreakers. For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it.   (James 2:8-10, NIV)  &gt;All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness,  (2 Timothy 3:16)  &gt;Do we, then, nullify the law by this faith? Not at all! Rather, we uphold the law.  (Romans 3:31)  &gt;Know this first of all, that *there is no prophecy of scripture that is a matter of personal interpretation*, for no prophecy ever came through human will; but rather human beings moved by the holy Spirit spoke under the influence of God.""  (2 Peter 1:20-21 NAB)  Well, shit.   This problem disappears quite quickly if you assert that most of the Bible is hogwash, and you only care about the good parts. If you prefer to cling to it as an inspired document, vague mutterings about ""context"" or about Jesus abolishing the old Law won't get you anywhere. ",™

After going to the station a few times and seeing him, I parked and just watched for ten minutes or so - the guy seemed to be making around $10 an hour just doing basic window cleaning, even though he'd only been around at that gas station a couple weeks.

""Feminist-Approved™.""  I'm entitled to my beliefs. I'm not a radical feminist. I'm just a regular one who tries to look at things from all sides. I agree with *some* of what MRAs say, but almost everything that Demonspawn said is just sexist, and he gets *upvoted* for it. *That's* why this place has an image problem, especially compared to a place like the feminist-friendly r/TwoXChromosomes, which downvotes pretty much any comments that say bad things about men (I rarely see them in the first place, though).  Just like how you're frustrated at certain issues being ignored, I'm tired of people assuming that my beliefs have been drummed into me by radical feminists. I have my beliefs, and you have yours. If people like Demonspawn and many of the other people on here aren't going to respect that, then I'm not going to sit here and take it. I'm trying to hold back anything that sounds too angry, but it's difficult when people claim my viewpoints and examples are invalid.  &gt;In fact, we know this is the case. We know that women, on a basic societal (and primal) level, are given more lenience than men.  He didn't specifically say anything about lenience. I agree that women get more lenience in *some* areas, but men get more lenience in others (the number of sexual partners they can have without being called a ""slut"" and often being expected to do more with their physical appearance, for example).   I'm just saying that even though men deal with unfair things, that doesn't mean women aren't considered disposable in other ways. What Demonspawn said about women makes women sound disposable. Seriously, I don't appreciate being told that my inherent worth is my womb and that women have to ""gain"" value, as if we're some sort of burden on society. I work, and so do a ton of other women, but according to Demonspawn, we haven't reached a level of ""worth"" on par with men yet.  &gt;Demonspawn is very blunt, hostile at times. Some of his positions are widely disagreed with by most other members here, but most of the things he said are in fact true, and phrased more bluntly than is common in typical feminist discussions.  ""Blunt"" and ""hostile"" is putting it lightly. *Most* of what Demonspawn said was full of bigotry and generalizations, which many of you people claim to be ""against"" (well, when it comes to judging *men* and *men's rights activists*, anyway). He even admitted to generalizing. I don't generalize *all* men or MRAs, but I'm not surprised to see sexism from people like Demonspawn.",™

t5_2qh1i,Valdovinos,1344164749,"Bear with me as I write a novel:  I have been burning out for a while. More of a long ramp than a straight fall for me. During sophomore and junior year in high school I stopped caring, failed a class blah blah. Senior year didn't go too well either. I ended up finishing high school about 50th percentile of my graduating class with a 2.5ish. That summer I decided not to go to a university because I wasn't offered financial aid.   I enrolled in a community college one city over and thus didn't know anyone. I took the placement exam and scored high enough to enter the honor's program and have tuition and books paid for for two years. I didn't maintain the required GPA the first semester and was placed on academic probation. In the end the scholarship only paid for my first year before I lost it. My next three semesters I received Pell Grants and scholarships, grades were never too good and hovered around a 3.0. However, during my time at that college I flourished. I joined a student organization, which I became President of in my second year. I made new friends that I still have (quality friends at that). During my time at this college I held two jobs on campus, one of which I still have, the other involved guiding new students through an orientation and campus tour. I met so many people and was/am on a first name basis with dozens of professors and college administration, I was able to go on retreats and actually become part of a community (as cheesy as that sounds).  I graduated from community college a year ago and started going to this huge university where I feel like ""just a number"". A few of my professors have known me by name, but I've never felt the same passion for knowledge and community building as I did at that community college (where I still work). I am having a hard time keeping my grades up, but I want to change that. I have no doubt in my mind that if I were to seek a niche at this university I would find one, but now I'm more interested in just finishing the degree and getting on with this part of my life. In less than 3 weeks I'll be starting my senior year. If all all goes as planned and I work very hard I'll have a BS in Economics in 3 semesters.  I guess what I'm trying to say is never stop wanting more. Just because you veer off the path doesn't mean you can't get back on it. Setbacks won't happen just once, but overcoming them gives you the momentum to keep going. You also have to want to do better and above all, you have to be willing to put in the work.    **TL;DR New beginnings are great, find what you're passionate about and don't let setbacks discourage you. I ♥ Pell Grants and the cliches you've heard make more sense the older you get!!!**",♥

Implicaţia este, desigur, aceea că unul dintre cele două posturi nu este reprezentativ pentru viziunea autorului, întrucât o viziune generală de toleranţă nu se poate manifesta simultan prin toleranţa etnică şi intoleranţa faţă de minorităţile sexuale.  Faptul că cel de-al doilea post vine ca răspuns la postul lui rockeh, post care (într-o manieră de asemenea umoristică) a înlocuit numele de Ion şi Janos cu numele Erzsi şi Saveta, sugerând că diferenţele cu ecouri xenofobe sunt oricum superficiale şi se estompează degrabă în faţa impulsurilor de reproducere, sugerează faptul că cel de-al doilea post al autorului este într-adevăr cel care nu este reprezentativ pentru viziunea sa. În acest fel, el creează un contrast între aparenţă (faptul că este intolerant faţă de minorităţile sexuale) şi esenţă (faptul că este de fapt o persoană tolerantă). Această figură de stil, prin care se enunţă un lucru din care de fapt se înţelege contrariul, este chiar ironia, termen definit de Dicţionarul Explicativ al Limbii Române chiar în acest fel:  &gt; IRONÍE s.f. 1. Cuvânt, frază conținând o ușoară batjocură, folosind semnificații opuse sensului lor obișnuit; zeflemea, persiflare. ◊ Ironia soartei = situație intervenită contrar tuturor așteptărilor, ca un joc neașteptat al întâmplării. 2. Categorie estetică și filozofică desemnând expresii sau imagini cu semnificații opuse sensului obișnuit, în scopul ridiculizării disimulate. ♦ **Figură de stil prin care se enunță ceva pentru a se înțelege contrariul**.

I had lost a bit of weight last year in preparation for a trip to Israel, and when I came back I injured my foot and got right back into the habit of not doing anything, and gained the majority of it back. So, a year later, here I am.  A little about me -    * 26 years old * Female * 5'2 ~~eyes are blue~~ * 286.5 lbs * Goal Weight = 140lbs * Daily Calorie Burn Goal = 2,700 calories * Daily Calorie Deficit = 750 calories * Daily Steps Goal = 10,000 steps (Not sure if this is realistic) * 100% Sedentary... until today.  I talked to my doctor again to help get me back on track, and he said that in his experience, he has only seen one person lose as much weight as I had twice after falling off the wagon for so long. That put me into ""Oh yeah? Well *I'll show you!*"" mode (knowing him, that's probably what he was doing. The man knows me well). So, today, I finally went out and did something. I fixed up my old bodybugg and slapped it on yesterday to get an idea of where my baseline was. Now that I have it, I moved today. Now, it isn't a lot of moving... I burned a little over 300 calories, but it took me an hour and I was sweating and head a good heart rate going.  The eating is going... well-ish. That hasn't been too much of a problem in the past, it's more the fact that it just hurts so damn badly to move, and then I get exhausted afterwards. I also get nauseated quite often when I'm exercising (and afterward) so at times I struggle to get in even 900 calories. Part of the issue is that I just get so damn tired, it's hard to cook anything and nothing sounds good.   So, there's my story, for better or worse.

t5_2qh0n,gallais,1344207543,"I went for [a typing derivation](http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=WjWf9Fhh) (you may want to decrease the font's size if you have a small screen like I do) or a proof in intuitionistic [sequent calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequent_calculus) if you prefer. If you manage to find nice pictograms for the brain / beauty parts, I guess it could look good.  Quick explanation : At the beginning Γ is defined as a bunch of operators. Let's have a look at one of them : Y. It is a function that given a conjunction of some A and some B (written A × B) followed by some C will give you back a conjunction of A, B and C (not a really complicated function as you may guess).  Then we prove that when we give the O and then the U defined in Γ to the operator Y (thus spelling ""you"") what we will get back is the conjunction of heart, beauty and brain. i.e. YOU is all of this.   How to understand the proof tree?  * A sequent     Γ ⊢ A means that in the context Γ we know that A is true.  * A deduction rule lists hypothesis on top of the bar and the conclusion one can draw from them at the bottom. By combining different deduction rules we build the proof tree.  \         Γ ⊢ Hypothesis1    Γ ⊢ Hypothesis2     _____________________________________name_of_the_rule           Γ ⊢  Conclusion  Here are the rules used in the proof and some intuition for them.  * axiom: if my context Γ tells me that something is a fact then it surely is!  \       A is in Γ      __________axiom       Γ ⊢  A  * modus ponens: if we know that A implies B (written A→B) and that A then we know that B.  \       Γ ⊢ A → B    Γ ⊢ A     ____________________modus ponens           Γ ⊢  B  * ∀ elimination : ∀ is the universal quantification. Eliminating it amounts to specializing the formula for a chosen argument: if P(A) is true for all A then it surely is true for B, ♥ or whatever else you want.  \       Γ ⊢ ∀A. P(A)     ____________________∀ elimination           Γ ⊢  P(B)   NB: In my derivation tree it's a bit more involved because instead of just proving that we can get e.g. some B we keep tract of how it was built! If f is a function building B from A and x is some A then f applied to x (written f x) is some B (and this is proven using modus ponens). All written up this gives:        Γ ⊢ f : A → B    Γ ⊢ x : A     ____________________________modus ponens           Γ ⊢  f x : B  If there's a part you don't understand feel free to ask. If you end up actually using this for your card, I wouldn't mind seeing the result. ;)",♥

t5_2sode,scartol,1344208567,"Male feminist here.   I don't know any feminists who want to ""shame men for [celebrating their sexuality]"". Obviously I can only speak for myself. I get frustrated not when men are celebrating their sexuality, but when they do so in a way that falls into stupid, violent, and/or dominating stereotypes about what it means to be masculine or feminine.   For example: A guy talking about having sex in and of itself doesn't frustrate me. What frustrates me is when the guy talks about how he ""hit it and quit it"" or pressured the woman to do things she wasn't too comfortable with. Or when a guy brags about how many meaningless sexual escapades he's had, stepping on the feelings of whatever females he's hooked up with along the way.   (Don't misunderstand: Sometimes both male and female -- in a heterosexual interaction; obviously different pronouns could be used in different contexts -- are interested in casual, no-strings-attached sex. I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about the guy *pretending* to be interested in the woman as a person, and then never calling again, etc. This answers, I think, the final question on your list.)  Which brings me to your next point:   &gt;I see the male urge to mate with many partners as being natural as many other species exhibit similar behaviors  Hmm. Well, many other species engage in [cannibalism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannibalism_%28zoology%29). But as a supposedly civilized species, we've trained ourselves to put certain filters on our otherwise-sensible-evolutionarily behavior, so as to interact with each other in a more humane and less barbaric way. So this is one reason to disabuse oneself of the notion that we should all be playaz in the name of propagating the species. (And given the type of guy who usually pursues this agenda -- I'm thinking here of the ""men"" of *Jersey Shore*, for example -- I doubt that's a gene pool we want to propagate heavily, anyway.)  And finally:  &gt;is there something wrong with finding some women sexy and some not?  Not necessarily. The questions relate to *how* and *why* you're doing this. If someone offers to set you up with a mutual friend, and after seeing a picture of her, you say ""She's kinda ugly"", that's a perfectly natural response, and -- although I would suggest to you that true beauty lies within -- I wouldn't be frustrated with your actions in such a context.   **However,** when a group of guys is standing in line for a movie, or eating lunch at the mall food court, or chilling at The Club™, and they're loudly judging every female who happens to appear based on their physical beauty for no real reason, then we're in scumbag territory.  Please note also that your opinion of female beauty -- like mine and the opinion of every other person on the planet -- is constantly subject to a powerful, well-financed, and ubiquitous propaganda campaign trying to convince you that there is only *one* standard of beauty, and it involves being underweight, passive (for the most part), deferential, and (usually) white. Throughout history many different body types have been considered ideal, and we just happen to be living in one where [this shape](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus_of_Willendorf) could never be drooled over by a majority of men.  Also please note that neither I nor most feminists I know advocate for a world when men are objectified or judged for their bodies in the same way women have been for centuries. Rather we'd like to see our society evolve to a point where we can appreciate physical beauty without hideous shaming, ridicule, judgment, etc etc.",™

t5_2qzqs,mutantmagnet,1344230983,"The following is a truncated revision for the contract I'm thinking of.  Preamble As customers of Valve Inc. we understand Valve’s need to make a new contract revising the terms for legal options. After reviewing your contract, and consulting your customer service representatives on the finer details, we can’t accept the terms as written and offer an alternative contract for you to consider.  We present this contract, not to represent just ourselves; but those who have already accepted the agreement in poor faith and to address the concerns of future consumers of Valve related products and services.  There is a tacit understanding made between us and Valve that Valve provides a venue for software developers and customers to sell and buy goods respectively with a set of advantages and disadvantages that we agree makes selling and buying on Steam worthwhile. Barring customers for using licenses they purchased under previous contracts because they won’t accept a new one with Valve is unconscionable and decaying the value both the developer and customer place in Valve’s services and platform.  An equally troubling problem is that Valve seeks to revoke our ability to act as a group. The ability to act as a group is a very powerful corrective force that allows people to make better judgements in how to deal with legal matters. It also allows them to better manage the costs in time and money by delegating responsibilities and sharing the burdens of any matter, not just legal.  Valve has long considered itself a good partner for buyers and a patron of positive consumer values. To throwout one of the most important tools in making the lives of their customers more efficient runs counter to past behavior and you need to carefully reconsider how you made such a faulty error in judgement.  All the changes found in this counter-offer is written in caps. To quickly find the changes simple search for the word [change].  To contact us for further negotiation you can *THIS WILL BE FILLED IN ONCE WE HASH OUT CERTAIN DETAILS*  Steam® subscriber agreement   &lt;snipped for brevity&gt;  10. Term and termination A. Term. The term of this agreement (the ""term"") commences on the date you first indicate your acceptance of these terms, and will continue in effect until otherwise terminated in accordance with this agreement. B. Termination by you. You may cancel your account at any time. You may cease use of a subscription at any time or, if you choose, you may request that we terminate your access to a subscription. However, subscriptions are not transferable, and even if your access to a subscription for a particular game or application is terminated, the original activation key will not be able to be registered to any other account, even if the game or application was purchased in a retail store. Access to subscriptions purchased as a part of a pack or bundle cannot be terminated individually, termination of access to one game within the bundle will result in termination of access to all games purchased in the pack will be removed from the account. Your cancellation of an account, or your cessation of use of any subscription or request that access to a subscription be terminated, will not entitle you to any refund, including of any subscription fees. Valve reserves the right to collect fees, surcharges or costs incurred prior to the cancellation of your account or termination of your access to a particular subscription. In addition, you are responsible for any charges incurred to third-party vendors or content providers before your cancellation. **[change]UPON CANCELLING YOUR ACCOUNT YOU STILL RETAIN ACCESS TO SOFTWARE PURCHASED FROM VALVE FROM STEAM BUT AREN’T GIVEN ACCESS TO ANY OF VALVE RELATED SERVICES AND ADDITIONAL SOFTWARE OTHER THAN THE SERVICE NEEDED FOR AUTHENTICATION OF YOUR PREVIOUS PURCHASE. IF YOU DECLINE TO ACCEPT THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT THIS ISN’T CONSIDERED TO BE CANCELLATION. YOU WILL HAVE THE SAME LIMITATIONS AS A CANCELLED ACCOUNT UNTIL YOU AGREE TO THE NEW TERMS YOU HAVE MADE WITH VALVE. [/change]** C. Termination by valve. Valve may cancel your account or any particular subscription(s) at any time. In the event that your account or a particular subscription is terminated or cancelled by valve for a violation of this agreement or improper or illegal activity, no refund, including of any subscription fees, will be granted. D. Survival of terms. Sections 2(c), 2(e), 2(f), 3(a), 3(b), 3(d), 3(h), and 5 - 13 will survive any expiration or termination of this agreement. Unused funds in your steam wallet are not refundable upon expiration or termination.   &lt;snipped for brevity&gt;  12. Dispute resolution/binding arbitration/class action waiver. Most user concerns can be resolved by use of our steam support site athttps://support.steampowered.com/. If we are unable to resolve your concerns and a dispute remains between you and valve, this section explains how we agree to resolve it. You and valve agree to resolve all disputes and claims between us in individual binding arbitration. That includes, but is not limited to, any claims arising out of or relating to: (i) any aspect of the relationship between us; (ii) this agreement; or (iii) your use of steam, your account or the software. It applies regardless of whether such claims are based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, unfair competition, misrepresentation or any other legal theory. However, this section does not apply to the following types of claims or disputes, which you or valve may bring in any court with jurisdiction: (i) claims of infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights, including such claims seeking injunctive relief; and (ii) claims related to or arising from any alleged unauthorized use, piracy or theft. This section does not prevent you from bringing your dispute to the attention of any federal, state, or local government agencies that can, if the law allows, seek relief from us for you. An arbitration is a proceeding before a neutral arbitrator, instead of before a judge or jury. Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court, and provides more limited discovery. It follows different rules than court proceedings, and is subject to very limited review by courts. The arbitrator will issue a written decision and provide a statement of reasons if requested by either party. You understand that you and valve are giving up the right to sue in court and to have a trial before a judge or jury. You and valve agree to make reasonable, good faith efforts to informally resolve any dispute before initiating arbitration. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send the other a written notice that describes the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and sets forth the relief sought. If you and valve do not reach an agreement to resolve that claim or dispute within 30 days after the notice is received, you or valve may commence an arbitration. Written notice to valve must be sent via postal mail to: attn: arbitration notice, valve corporation, p.o. box 1688, bellevue, wa 98004. The federal arbitration act applies to this section. The arbitration will be governed by the commercial arbitration rules of the american arbitration association (“AAA”) and, where applicable, the aaa’s supplementary procedures for consumer related disputes, as modified by this agreement, both of which are available athttp://www.adr.org. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this agreement. The AAA will administer the arbitration. It may be conducted through the submission of documents, by phone, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location. If you seek $10,000 or less, valve agrees to reimburse your filing fee and your share of the arbitration costs, including your share of arbitrator compensation, at the conclusion of the proceeding, unless the arbitrator determines your claims are frivolous or costs are unreasonable as determined by the arbitrator. Valve agrees not to seek its attorneys' fees or costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines your claims are frivolous or costs are unreasonable as determined by the arbitrator. If you seek more than $10,000, the arbitration costs, including arbitrator compensation, will be split between you and valve according to the AAA commercial arbitration rules and the AAA’s supplementary procedures for consumer related disputes, if applicable. **[change]YOU AND VALVE AGREE NOT TO BRING OR PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION EVEN IF AAA’S PROCEDURES OR RULES WOULD OTHERWISE ALLOW ONE. YOU MAY BRING OR PARTICPATE IN COLLECTIVE ARBITRATION. THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL OR COLLECTIVE PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT OF THAT PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL OR COLLECTIVE CLAIM. [/change]**You and valve also agree not to seek to combine any action or arbitration with any other action or arbitration without the consent of all parties to this agreement and all other actions or arbitrations. **[change]IF THE AGREEMENT IN THIS SECTION NOT TO BRING OR PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION SHOULD BE FOUND ILLEGAL OR UNENFORCEABLE, YOU AND VALVE AGREE THAT IT SHALL NOT BE SEVERABLE, THAT THIS ENTIRE SECTION SHALL BE UNENFORCEABLE AND ANY CLAIM OR DISPUTE WOULD BE RESOLVED IN COURT OR IN COLLECTIVE ARBITRATION.[/change]** Notwithstanding this section, you have the right to litigate any dispute in small claims court, if all the requirements of the small claims court, including any limitations on jurisdiction and the amount at issue in the dispute, are satisfied. This section 12 shall apply to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. If the laws of your jurisdiction prohibit the application of some or all of the provisions of this section notwithstanding section 11 (applicable law/jurisdiction), such provisions will not apply to you. &lt;snipped for brevity&gt;",®

The island, located about 50 kilometres off the coast of Whakatane, is an active volcano and a popular tourist spot.  Its web camera captured the small eruption from Crater Lake, GNS Science volcanologist Michael Ronsenberg said.  ""These phenomena are not unknown for While Island, but this is the first substantial confirmation that small scale eruptions are now occurring on the island and confirms the risk to visitors has increased,"" he said.  ""Eruptions can occur at any time with little or no warning. We advise extra caution should be taken, if visiting the island.""  GNS has changed the volcano's code from ""experiencing signs of elevated unrest above known background levels"" to ""volcanic eruption is underway with no or minor ash emissions"".  The alert level has also changed from one to two due to ""minor eruptive activity"".  It follows a code change last week when scientists discovered water levels in Crater Lake rose by about 3m to 5m overnight and the number of tremors had increased.  There was a particularly stronger seismic episode recorded Sunday morning, ending in a volcanic earthquake at 4.54am that day.  Rosenberg said: ""[The earthquake] had a sound signal, which meant something happened on the surface. So we went back and looked at the camera images.""  ""Obviously being at night time, there was no visual observations and initially we weren't able to determine what that small event was.  ""But we've narrowed it down and recognise that there has been full hydrothermal eruption.""  Rosenberg said there had not been any further eruptions, and the number of tremors had decreased.  ""It's now at similar levels to before the weekend.""  GNS Science was ""paying close attention"" to the volcano as the last ""gentle eruption"" had been in early 2001.  White Island also experienced a ""moderate-sized explosion"" in July 2000, when fresh lava was pushed out.  ""In the past this kind of activity has increased to small eruptions that produce ash, and that ash could drift as far as the mainland,"" Rosenberg said.  ""We can't predict what the volcano is going to do and we are not making any forecasts, but yes, it's certainly possible that the activity could ramp up again.""  - © Fairfax NZ News",©

t5_2cneq,sheasie,1344254839,"OK.  How about this:  Republicans are all about ""taxes"".  Fine.  That's an important one, I agree.  Conversely, I think the Democrats should be all about ""democracy"" -- fitting, by title -- also and obviously an important one.  Here's the pledge:  **TITLE:  One American. One Vote.™**  **PLEDGE:  I pledge to never limit an American's ability to vote.™**  (vs. I pledge to never raise taxes.)  Failure to sign would result in targeted SuperPAC ads branding you as being ""willing to rig elections"".  (It could easily be argued.)  So rather than deal with the potential attacks in the upcoming election, it's better to sign the pledge.  (Sure it's political blackmail -- just as Norquist's pledge is political blackmail, but why not... the ""One American One Vote"" pledge is way more reasonable than ""Never Raise Taxes"".)  So of course you eventually get all the Dems to sign the pledge (just as Norquist got all the Repubs to sign his).  Bonus if you could catch a couple of sleazy Republicans on video scoffing at that pledge. (That would be sweet nectar.)  **BOTTOM LINE:**  Everyone knows... that the more people who vote, the more likely ""liberal"" agendas will prevail.  (Which is why the Republicans are always trying to limit and effectively kill democracy.)  At the end of the day, the pledge would prevail and it would be effective, in that it will become easier for people to vote, and as more people vote, a Democratic agenda will prevail by nature... BY NATURE (i.e., guided by the Will of God, it could be argued).  EDIT/PS.

An edit will be forthcoming once I've read the post and I have more understanding of the situation.  ===  Okay, I've read it.  Wow, man. You need to get this woman out of your life, and the sooner the better. For starters, you're right about putting in a whole lot into the relationship and not getting anything out of it in return, and secondly, you're not only enabling her, but you're falling into a textbook case of enabling.  I will tell you this right now, because you really need a good dose of Tough Love™: **No matter what, this girl will never, EVER return your feelings.** She's taking advantage of them, consciously or not, and she's doing it purely out of self interest. She has no desire to take your feelings into consideration. None.  &gt;The awful thing is that I know this is all wrong and that I should just tell her to leave, but being around her makes me happy. I still hold out these hopes that we can someday be together, and I can get her off the drugs and get her some help.  To the first part: I don't believe for a second that you're happy when you're with her. You like the feeling of being around her much in the way somebody on drugs likes getting high. In essence, you've turned one kind of addiction into another, and you're convincing yourself that it counts as happiness, when all it really ends up being is you telling yourself that times are good even when they aren't. It's a lot like Battered Wife Syndrome, where a spouse will tell themselves ""Yeah, sometimes it sucks, but when it *doesn't* suck, things are great.""  To the second part: You'll never get her off the drugs. The only way she'll do that is if something knocks some sense into her, and I might even be talking literally. If she's as into the pills as you seem to indicate, then you keeping her around is only prolonging her addictive behavior. As long as she's around you, she can afford to keep doing it, she has a safe place to go in order to do it, and she has a shoulder to cry on and money to take if she needs it. You are not helping her ONE IOTA by keeping her around.  &gt;Keep in mind that I have really strong feelings for her still and don't wish to do her harm.  You're harming her right now, and you will continue to do it for as long as you're willing to ""help"" her. If you *really* want what's best for her, then you need to give her her own form of Tough Love™ and tell her to get out and never talk to you again. And man, am I EVER not kidding when I say that. It's best for both of you, and you absolutely cannot allow her to be part of your life, ever again. She's made her choices, and now it's going to be HER responsibility to decide whether she's going to sink or swim. But if she stays around you and you keep enabling her, she'll only sink.",™

I came to understand the Zionist conspiracies after 8 years of research into 9/11 prior to that I was not antisemitic. **The more one looks into the Zionist rabbit hole the deeper it gets.**   The SPLC is a Zionist operation with ties to most False Flag events in the USA.   **Hate and Slander for Profit** Dissecting the Southern Poverty Law Center Report A Special Report from Digger's Realm August 2009  This report was prepared by Dan Amato and edited by Ruth Miller of www.IllegalProtest.com  Digger's Realm is supported entirely by private donations. No government funds are involved. © Dan Amato. All rights reserved  Introduction BY DAN AMATO  In August, 2009 the Southern Poverty Law Center released a ""Special Report"" entitled ""The Second Wave: Return of the Militias"". In this completely fabricated conspiracy theory of a report, Mark Potok, Larry Keller and David Holthouse continue to point their fingers at legitimate American Citizens of this country - who have real concerns - and call them racists and hate-mongers.  In this ""Special Report"" of my own entitled ""Hate and Slander for Profit: Dissecting the Southern Poverty Law Center Report"" I intend to set the record straight on this piece of race-card playing, pile of lies that the SPLC continues to perpetuate in order to justify their existence.  If you have a second-grader handy, you could probably write a similar report as the SPLC has done and peddle it around as real journalism to all of the mainstream media outlets. They scarf this race dividing and hateful garbage up - and hey - they love a good conspiracy theory. They might even get some gullible, useful idiots to donate money to you thinking you're doing something good for this country and its people.  I urge all of you who are reading this to pass it on to your friends. The activities of the SPLC must be exposed for what they are. You can download a printable PDF of this full report here to hand out or spread around.

t5_2s4m9,ClashOfFeminizations,1344272540,"**How to argue like a white racist**  [ ]Anything but race – Racism is over. There must be some Logical Explanation that has nothing to do with race.  [ ]Blame-shifting – Blacks like to use the race card, crying racism and blaming whitey, but blacks are to blame for their own mess. Racism is so 1968.  [ ]ad hominem – question a commenter’s intelligence, character, age or motives.  [ ]Whites are individuals – so you cannot make general statements about whites. Besides, that would be racist.  [ ]“Blacks are racist too” - but they do not like to admit it. Find a case where a black person did something just as bad as what they are pointing out.  [ ]“You are the racist one” - turn the tables.  [ ]“I am offended” – how dare they call you a racist! You do not see a person’s colour – they could be purple for all you care!  **[✔]Arab trader argument – whites are not as evil as black people like to think. For example, it was not just white people who traded slaves: Arabs did it too! Few blacks know that, so make sure to point that out whenever you can.**  [ ]“But that happened to me too!” – whatever blacks complain about, try to find a case where a white person – you, a friend, someone in the news -  experienced the same thing.  [ ]Point out how “ghetto” and disagreeable black people are – because they are and it needs pointing out. No wonder no one gets along with them!  [ ]Talk down to them – they are imagining things, they do not know what they are talking about. How dare blacks tell us what we are like. What do they know? Are they white? [ ]straw man – argue against some stock position that is kind of like the post. That way you can copy your comments from another blog. Or from Ann Coulter.  [ ]Blacks need to be colour-blind – if they just stopped seeing race and talking about it so much then racism would go away!  [ ]Start quoting rape statistics – out of the blue, if necessary. Rates of imprisonment are good too.  [ ]The white inventor argument – whites invented everything so shut up already.  [ ]Demand proof – Make them prove it beyond a reasonable doubt with facts and figures. Find holes in whatever facts they present. Find counter-facts.  [ ]Make it about the past - and point out that your family never owned slaves. When are they going to stop living in the past?  [ ]Go back to Africa – if it is so bad here, then go back to Africa already!  [ ]Bootstrap – I made it on my own without help from anyone.  Blacks expect something for nothing!  [ ]Some of my best friends are black – so there is no way I am racist!  **[✔]Might makes right – all through history.**  [Source](http://abagond.wordpress.com/2009/10/05/how-to-argue-like-a-white-racist/)  ***  Too lazy to look through and check off all the other ones that apply, anyone want to?",✔

What is ultimately sad about all the time and effort that goes into ""researching"" these articles is that it is no more rewarding that studying, say, the mythology, legend, and prophecies of the fictional land of Middle Earth.      An interesting point I like to reflect on is that on their heads, these prophecies don't make hardly any of the connections that the Org makes.  It is only by the power of Holy Spirit™ that they make any of these applications or assertions.   But holy spirit is undetectable, untestable, and unknowable.  It is, literally, the most ephemeral substance in the entire Scriptures.  There is no defined way to receive it and it behaves in no understandable pattern.   Many Christians claim to have it, yet the Governing Body says it is the only group that it is active upon today.  If this is the entire reason we are to trust the Org, we need to have some *very* good evidence proving this so.  Yet,  every chance they've gotten to *really prove* that the holy spirit has revealed something hidden, it is failed in application (1914, 1918, 1975, etc...)  One would be reasonable to expect a higher success rate for such an illustrious group of men.      So the next time someone touts to you that the Org has God's holy spirit, ask them how they know.   Then, when they are unable to answer, tell them that you have a difficult time trusting someone who is always wrong.",™

You don't think people would create those things independent of government?  You don't think, like every other good and service in the world, those things would be created and provided by greedy, wealth-seeking entrepreneurs...who must rely solely on the value they provide to their market in order to remain profitable?  Further, would competition for those things be a negative? Surely someone from /r/business would understand that a monopoly maintained by force is a Bad Thing™.  That competition would yield greater efficiency, lower costs, innovation and increased quality, as it does in every single other unmolested market.  Rather than have the funds for these things extracted from me under threat of violence, is it absurd for me to suggest that I should be able to find them in a competitive market, voluntarily and without coercion?  To choose to pay for the one that fits my needs best (or indeed, not pay for one at all, even to my own peril?).",™

Racism is so 1968.**  [ ]ad hominem – question a commenter’s intelligence, character, age or motives.  [ ]Whites are individuals – so you cannot make general statements about whites. Besides, that would be racist.  **[✔]“Blacks are racist too” - but they do not like to admit it. Find a case where a black person did something just as bad as what they are pointing out.**  **[✔]“You are the racist one” - turn the tables.**  [ ]“I am offended” – how dare they call you a racist! You do not see a person’s colour – they could be purple for all you care!  [ ]Arab trader argument – whites are not as evil as black people like to think. For example, it was not just white people who traded slaves: Arabs did it too! Few blacks know that, so make sure to point that out whenever you can.  **[✔]“But that happened to me too!” – whatever blacks complain about, try to find a case where a white person – you, a friend, someone in the news -  experienced the same thing.**  **[✔]Point out how “ghetto” and disagreeable black people are – because they are and it needs pointing out. No wonder no one gets along with them!**  **[✔]Talk down to them – they are imagining things, they do not know what they are talking about. How dare blacks tell us what we are like. What do they know? Are they white?**  **[✔]straw man – argue against some stock position that is kind of like the post. That way you can copy your comments from another blog. Or from Ann Coulter.**  **[✔]Blacks need to be colour-blind – if they just stopped seeing race and talking about it so much then racism would go away!**  **[✔]Start quoting rape statistics – out of the blue, if necessary. Rates of imprisonment are good too.**  [ ]The white inventor argument – whites invented everything so shut up already.  [ ]Demand proof – Make them prove it beyond a reasonable doubt with facts and figures. Find holes in whatever facts they present. Find counter-facts.  [ ]Make it about the past - and point out that your family never owned slaves. When are they going to stop living in the past?  [ ]Go back to Africa – if it is so bad here, then go back to Africa already!  [ ]Bootstrap – I made it on my own without help from anyone.  Blacks expect something for nothing!  **[✔]Some of my best friends are black – so there is no way I am racist!**  [ ]Might makes right – all through history.

The judge has committed a great sin for being in violation of not only this part of the verse, but also for being unjust with his authority and ruling; 2. The family has committed a great sin for being in violation of this part of the verse and abusing the trust of their daughter; and 3. The rapist has committed a great sin for being in violation of this verse, on top of everything else he did.  This unfortunate and heart-breaking incident has nothing to do with Islam but everything to do with culture in a third-world country.

Most of their objections come primarily from pre-existing contempt for, or own projections of malevolence, towards male sexuality. I've never really seen any feminists oppose ""PUA/Game"" because it's actually pretty demeaning to men or reinforces the idea of strict gender roles for men. It's like rather than looking at all the gender issues that lead to the ""PUA/Game"" movement in the first place or saying to men ""hey, it's okay to be who you are!"", they just go ""hey! There are men willing to put a lot of money, time and effort to give up things about themselves we don't like, just to cater to our sexist demands, embody belittling gender roles that we're attracted to and do the work we're not really willing to do to meet men!"".  How many women, feminists or even PUA's are really willing to say ""it's okay for men to be shy or insecure too, we can meet you half way!"", ""you shouldn't have to pay to meet, talk or date women, your company is just as valuable!"" or ""You don't have to be a Man™, you are a human being and it's okay to just be a man""?  A lot of times you'll even find them encouraging game, with things like the ""anti-nice guy"" or ""friend-zone denial"" rants, simply because they don't want to acknowledge that there are gender issues that are hurting men or benefiting women, and that they are complacent to their existence.

Keep in mind the guy is pointing out that Linux hadn't reached the EAL certification Windows had, and yet Windows was still not acceptable.  Admittedly he's specifically pointing this out because their product is an OS that does have all three features.  There is plenty of information about what the FAA requires on the [FAA website](http://fsims.faa.gov/WDocs/8900.1/V10%20Air%20Trans%20Over%20Sys/Chapter%2001/10_001_002.htm), and littered throughout the internet.

t5_2qh2p,whateverweirdo07,1344408918,"The people you're describing are what I've been calling ""casual Christians.""  If you don't think the Christian bible can be taken literally, it blows open the doors on the religion. It just becomes some run of the mill, man-made philosophy. If you look at Christianity historically, scientifically ignorant people had no problem with the universe being created in six days. The Old Testament's explanation of the universe is perfectly valid to scientifically ignorant people. It's literally true to them. In scientifically literate cultures, that stuff is obviously ridiculous, so you have casuals hiding behind allegory. As Neil Tyson put it, at that point, religion simply becomes ""an ever receding pocket of scientific ignorance.""  If you go with the allegory angle, how is Christianity different than any other philosophy? Why would anyone dedicate their life and theoretical afterlife to something like that?  Let's get realistic here. What is one of the major things people are getting out of Christianity? It's comforting. It gives humanity a place in the universe. It gives them meaning, and it dulls their fear of dying with its promise of an afterlife. If the Christian bible is all allegorical, I suppose ""the kingdom of heaven"" is allegorical too, right? Most Christians believe that heaven is real.  That's pure casual Christian. If something is beneficial, comforting, and obviously fantastic (heaven), they literally believe in it. If something isn't comforting and fantastic (god flooding the world and killing almost everyone), then it's allegorical and they don't literally believe in it.  If you're picking and choosing passages from the Christian bible based on whether you like them or not, you're not a ""devout Christian.""  Why not go all the way with that train of thought? Why not just pull the things you like from Buddhist texts if you like something in them, too? Why not just pick and choose any philosophy you like? That's not Christianity. That's a smorgasbord of succor™.",™
t5_2qh2p,Dudesan,1344409400,"If you think Jesus nullified the Old Testament, you're gonna have a bad time.  Remember, many Christians find it more comfortable to believe in a god who doesn't condone, command or commit murder, slavery, rape, child abuse, animal abuse, arson, torture, ritual mutilation, fratricide, patricide, matricide, infanticide, genocide, and so on than to believe in one who does.  Unfortunately, since the Bible (Old Testamant and New) is pretty clear about Yahweh's position on these things, holding a belief in Loving Hippie Jesus™ requires ignoring huge portions of it. Or just never reading it in the first place, which seems to be the most popular option.  Well, let's say what Jesus has to say about that:  &gt;“Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished.  (Matthew 5:17-18, NIV)  Some Christians claim that his death and resurrection ""fulfill"" this. That is bullshit for one simple reason: last time I checked, Heaven and Earth haven't passed away.  Jesus also made his views on people ""picking and choosing"" quite clear:  &gt;[Jesus] answered them, “And why do you break God’s commandment because of your tradition? For God said:    *Honor your father and your mother;* and, *The one who speaks evil of father or mother must be put to death.*  &gt; But you say, ‘Whoever tells his father or mother, “Whatever benefit you might have received from me is a gift committed to the temple”—  he does not have to honor his father.’ In this way, you have revoked God’s word because of your tradition. Hypocrites! Isaiah prophesied correctly about you when he said:    &gt;These people honor Me with their lips, but their heart is far from Me.  They worship Me in vain, teaching as doctrines the commands of men.”  (Matthew 15:3-9, NIV)   Looks like Jesus has quite a bit to say about people who ignore commandments, in fact. But maybe it's just Matthew?  &gt;It is easier for heaven and earth to disappear than for the least stroke of a pen to drop out of the Law.  (Luke 16:17, NIV)  Okay, so Jesus is a bust. Let's see what the Epistles have to say about the Mosaic Code:  &gt; If you really keep the royal law found in Scripture, “Love your neighbor as yourself,” you are doing right.  But if you show favoritism, you sin and are convicted by the law as lawbreakers. For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it.   (James 2:8-10, NIV)  &gt;All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness,  (2 Timothy 3:16)  &gt;Do we, then, nullify the law by this faith? Not at all! Rather, we uphold the law.  (Romans 3:31)  &gt;Know this first of all, that *there is no prophecy of scripture that is a matter of personal interpretation*, for no prophecy ever came through human will; but rather human beings moved by the holy Spirit spoke under the influence of God.""  (2 Peter 1:20-21 NAB)  Well, shit.   This problem disappears quite quickly if you assert that most of the Bible is hogwash, and you only care about the good parts. If you prefer to cling to it as an inspired document, vague mutterings about ""context"" or about Jesus abolishing the old Law won't get you anywhere. ",™

t5_2qxih,jaspor,1344442120,"Hi everyone,  For those of you that don’t know, I’m Joveth Gonzalez, Community Manager for Star Wars™: The Old Republic™.   As most of you know, over the past few months, our team, our studio, and our game have undergone quite a few changes. Through it all, we’ve remained committed to the community and have worked with the development team to make sure that your voices were heard.  I wanted to take some time to reassure you all that my team, the community team, is still committed to you folks. As part of this commitment, we’re excited to let you know that we have been developing a brand new strategy for our team that focuses on developing new ways to bring you more information about the game and the people involved with SWTOR's development.   As we progress towards the recently announced Free-to-Play experience, you can expect more frequent updates to the game (which means more information coming to you) and more developer interactions.   The Star Wars: The Old Republic community is large and spread across many outlets, but rest assured that our team is scouring the forums, Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, fan sites, and anywhere that SWTOR is being discussed to make sure that we get your thoughts, comments, questions, and general feedback. Know that we are listening you, no matter where you choose to participate in the SWTOR community.  In the upcoming weeks, you’ll be seeing elements of our new community strategy as they appear on our site. One of our primary goals with this is to ensure that new information about the game is communicated as quickly and effectively as possible.   Last but not least, I will be re-introducing the rest of community team along with this new strategy. You may have already seen them here on the forums or on the website, but you will learn more about Allison Berryman, Eric Musco, Courtney Woods, Amber Green, Lars Malcharek, and Antonio Moreno.   We're all excited about the future of this game and with the new focus on more frequent content updates and the introduction of the Free-to-Play experience, you can expect more communication opportunities overall.  If you have any questions, thoughts, or ideas, please feel free to send us an email at community@swtor.com. You can also send me a PM here on the forums or reach me on Twitter @joveth. These are three different ways for you to get in touch. We will limit important announcements to only occur on our site, forums, our Facebook page, and/or the official SWTOR Twitter account.   Thank you, sincerely, for participating and being a part of our community over the past few months. We look forward to hearing more from you in the future.  Joveth Gonzalez | Online Community Manager",™

t5_2qh1i,carpe-jvgvlvm,1344474553,"Well I didn't date much in high school, and finally started hanging out with a much older (oooh, 19yo!) really cute boy. We'd go on long walks through the woods and make out after dusk. I really, *really* thought that was the pinnacle of, um, *consummation*, at least with this very nice guy that I wasn't in love or anything; it was just fun kissing and some feeling. Often. And it was exhilarating. This went on for almost two months (summertime ♥ )  One night, a few days before he was going back to college, he asked me, very coyly, to put *blarbarblar* pants. I didn't understand. Then he kissed me, and was still unusually shy and coy... I was confused and had no idea what he was looking for. But I was all sing-song happy, and he was quiet and serious, like he was in pain but content [horny as hell but I didn't know it]. He finally leaned over and whispered in my ear, 'put it down my pants.'  I was in a good-spirited mood, giggling at his shyness (again, horniness, but I didn't know), and I didn't really know what to do, so I played with the sides of his jeans, tugging on them a bit. I played with my dress, swayed a bit as I studied him. Then I got an idea, pulled a foot-long stick off the fence, and stabbed it down his pants. I was laughing and running, thinking ""ooh, fun game!"", but when I turned around, he was kneeling on the ground screaming.  I ran back when I realized he was hurt, but he couldn't speak. I offered to go call 911; he begged me not to. So I sat with him. He held my hand and said he liked me but I was just too young. (LMAO looking back he was the sweetest guy on earth!) After that night, he wrote me sweet letters, but always treated me like a kid sister. I mean, we never kissed again. :(  I learned a boy wants your *hand* on his nether regions, not a dead tree. \*sigh\*",♥
t5_2qh1i,rocketshipotter,1344474581,"Well, once a week, it's good to use a clarifying shampoo, especially if you use products, because it can help get rid of buildup from residue from hairspray, styling gel, volumizer, or whatever.   And if you dye your hair, typically it's best to get a new, color safe shampoo, especially if it's some shade of red or an unnatural color. Because using regular shampoo on certain colors can cause the color to fade pretty fast.   *The more you know™* ",™

t5_2ray9,antisocialmedic,1344487426,"&gt; For example, if a portion of your test includes equipment hoists and charged line drags, you could superset those two, and get really proficient at them. Functional training will be your best friend.  For this, did you have access to the actual equipment in question or did you find some other way to simulate it? I unfortunately recently had to leave the department I volunteered at because I moved away and would need to find a means for simulation. They do post the fitness requirements for entry. They are as follows;  * Event 1: High Rise Pack Carry: timed event;  (42 lbs; 19 kg) (may be carried in any manner) up the drill tower interior stairs five stories (48.5 vertical feet) and deposit it into the blue square marked on the top floor. handrails may be used,  Applicants must hit every step ascending and descending stairs in the tower.  * Event 2: Hose Hoist: A 42-pound (19 kg) donut roll of large diameter hose and 5/8-inch (16mm) kern mantle rope is used for this event; pplicant is not allowed to stand on anything other than the top platform while hoisting.is complete when the roll clears the railing at the top of the tower and is placed on the platform. The doughnut roll must remain on the platform. When descending the tower, the applicant must make contact with each step and grasp the handrail.   * Event 3: Forcible Entry: The forcible entry evolution utilizes the Keiser Force Machine™ (a chopping simulator). Using the 9-lb. (4 kg) shot mallet provided, the applicant must drive the 160-lb. (72.5kg) steel beam a horizontal distance of five feet (1.5m). Pushing, raking or hooking the beam is not allowed; only the head of the mallet is allowed to strike the beam. The handle must not come in contact with the beam at any time.    * Event 4: Hose Advance: The applicant must pick up the nozzle end of the 1 3/4” (4.45cm) charged hose line and drag it a distance of 75 feet (22.8m). Once the nozzle crosses the threshold 75 feet away, the applicant places the nozzle on the pavement.   * Event 5: Victim Rescue: A 175-pound (79.4kg) mannequin must be dragged backwards a distance of 100 feet (30.5m). Carrying the dummy is not permitted. Time stops when the applicant and victim completely cross the finish line.   &gt;Cardiovascular training should be a major concern, too, but every female I've seen at the physical test has performed poorly with heavy workloads. I can give you a workout regiment, if you'd like one. You could keep me posted on your weights/times, and we could work on your weaknesses and improve your strengths.  This would be very helpful and I would appreciate it a lot. I'm a fairly stout lady and stronger than most, but am naturally at a disadvantage when it comes to feats of strength. Any help on getting a regimen together would be highly appreciated.   I will look into that book as well, anything to help in that area would be great. Job interviews are a huge weakness of mine (I never know how to answer that damned question, ""what is your greatest flaw"", if I were honest it would be going through job interviews).   I appreciate all of your input, it has been very helpful. Thanks. ",™

Please support the film and help it get made into a commercially viable feature film by contributing at http://www.indiegogo.com/graystatemovie.  GRAY STATE SYNOPSIS The world reels with the turmoil of war, geological disaster, and economic collapse, while Americans continue to submerge themselves in illusions of safety and immunity. While rights are sold for security, the federal government, swollen with power, begins a systematic takeover of liberty in order to bring about a New World Order.  Americans, quarantined to militarized districts, become a population ripe for tyrannical control.  Fearmongering, terrorism, police state, martial law, war, arrest, internment, hunger, oppression, violence, resistance -- these are the new terms by which Americans define their existence. Neighbor is turned against neighbor as the value of the dollar plunges to zero, food supplies are depleted, and everyone is a terror suspect. There are arrests. Disappearances. Bio attacks. Public executions of those even suspected of dissent. Even rumors of concentration camps on American soil.   This is the backdrop to an unfolding story of resistance. American militias prepare for guerilla warfare. There are mass defections from the military as true Patriots attempt to rally around the Constitution and defend liberty, preparing a national insurgency against federal forces, knowing full well this will be the last time in history the oppressed will be capable of organized resistance.   It is a time of transition, of shifting alliance, of mass awakening and mass execution. It is an impending storm, an iron-gray morning that puts into effect decades of over-comfort and complacency, and Americans wake up to an occupied homeland. It is a time of lists -- black list, white list, and those still caught in the middle, those who risk physical death for their free will and those who sell their souls to maintain their idle thoughts and easy comforts. It is in this Gray State that the perpetuation of human freedom will be contested, or crushed.  Is it the near future, or is it the present? The Gray State is coming - by consent or conquest. This is battlefield USA.   Watch in 720HD for best quality.

The cause are various phenols which are initially produced by the yeast. Chlorophenols result from the reaction of chlorine-based sanitizers (bleach) with phenol compounds and have very low taste thresholds. Rinsing with boiled water after sanitizing is the best way to prevent these flavors.  Band aid aroma/flavour is a description of phenols. Some yeasts produce more than others, especially belgian yeasts and wheat yeasts.  Phenols plus chlorine results in the more medicinal side of things (I believe).  It may be your water had some, or the sanitizer left some behind that wasn't rinsed away.    I would assume the beer isn't infected and happens to be extremely phenolic which can also be bad in itself.  Wait another 3 weeks or so for it to finish carbonating/conditioning and see how it tastes then.  If it's still too harsh for you have some brave friends try samples and one of them may like it if they aren't as sensitive to phenols (sensitivity varies greatly between people).

[Here's the video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz9BJACR7yE&amp;feature=youtu.be).   As you can see, car riders have to fiddle with device almost every day, and change its settings depending on whether they are riding solo, with one other person, with more, or on special days. Seriously.  And for motorcycles... it is basically stupid. The placement requirements for the bike are the same as cars. So... any motorcycle without a windshield (many, perhaps even most bikes) will be instantly illegal, since the device must be on the windshield.  And that means the device is out in the weather, on a motorcycle, and can be stolen by any passerby and used by them on their own vehicle.  The stupidity is colossal.

t5_2sc3f,complex_reduction,1344566705,"Well yeah, but in a typical Steampunk setting rats would be very common. So if you wanted to keep the rats in the game, you could have ... I dunno ... Dr Disatro's Radtastic Rat-Attractor^© gadget you could throw down which would attract rats out of sewer grates etc, as opposed to Harry Steampotter wishing them out of a genie's arse.  Instead of flying around the street magically you could have ... Professor Maniac's Magnificent Magnet Master^© which lets you attract or repel yourself to/from metal objects.  You could have a limit to the number of gadgets you could carry at a time and have to select which ones would be most appropriate for the mission. Assuming this game will be open world(ish) ala Skyrim you could scout the locations ahead of time. Is there enough metal to make magnets a viable tool? Is it a dirty warehouse where attracting rats or other wildlife could be effective? Etc, etc.  I guess you could also go the ""Gentleman Barbarian"" route and go in with a clanky steam-powered minigun!  I dunno I just think they're seriously misreading why people are attracted to the Steampunk setting in the first place. One of the biggest attractions is that it's not a typical fantasy setting. The gameplay should be different to typical fantasy games. The more videos I watch the more I'm convinced this entire game is just an official Skyrim expansion pack.

t5_2qr7i,VolatileChemical,1344593101,"&gt; Circumcision? Lack of alternative male contraception?  First of all, they're working on the male pill, so cool your jets and hope it tastes like cinnamon. Second, circumcision isn't law. It's not right that *some* parents do it to babies when they can't protest it, just like baptism, assigning gender roles, or naming them ""Mortimer"". But it's not really comparable to the state denying freedom to mature intelligent autonomous adults who deserve respect.... and people named Mortimer, who, let's face it, you can't ever really respect.  &gt; Being talked at like mindless violent rapists and paedophiles is so much better.  First of all, props for the old-timey ""ae"" spelling of ""*pÆd*ophile""! I feel like the word *pedophile* has lost a lot of its respectability in recent times, not sure why. I blame the spelling. Number B: most rapists and pedophiles are men. (Yes, I know your counter-argument: most babies are girls. But you can still usually tell if they're an actual baby or an adult woman.) And beyond that, individual men aren't *called* rapists and pædophiles. I'd bet my fortune no one's ever seriously called you a pædophile (or even a *ped*ophile). As for rapist, some women on the street might be silently cautious of the possibility of men being rape-tastic; with good reason, 1 in 6 women are raped. But men don't have women *verbalizing* such fears and disapproval as dehumanizing put-downs every day. They don't have women talking to them on the street or at work as if they were rapists, or calling them rapists, like women get called ""sweetie"", ""honey"" or ""baby"". Men can take subways and walk past construction sites without women gawking and shouting ""Hey rapiiiist, lookin' for a good time?"" If anything, it's all these men who talk sexually or demeaningly to women who are acting like rapists... verbally that is, not with the, y'know, rape portion.  &gt; Equality quotas on simply entering a job meaning better qualified men being passed over for women.  The idea that Affirmative Action gives jobs to less qualified applicants is a common myth, much like the Sasquatch, the Loch Ness Monster, and the vastly underrated Loch Ness Sasquatch. This is a tragically underestimated fact... I mean, he's a sasquatch! Who can *swim*! Come on!! But I digress. For the most part, AA (the employment-related one that is, not the alcoholism group, the battery size, or — we were all thinking it — the classic 1992 computer game ""Ancient Anguish"") is about choosing the disadvantaged applicant when of *equal* qualification to an applicant who is both qualified and privileged. Especially in terms of gender, this is not a statistical concern for men. Per *Institute for Research on Poverty*: [""results show some evidence of lower educational qualifications among blacks and Hispanics hired under Affirmative Action, but not among white women. [...] For the most part, Affirmative Action does not lead to the hiring of minorities or women with substantially lower qualifications or weaker job performance.""](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CEwQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.irp.wisc.edu%2Fpublications%2Fdps%2Fpdfs%2Fdp111396.pdf&amp;ei=4cskUOS8K4Gy2QX73oHYBA&amp;usg=AFQjCNHLuzmoFpiaSW16yv-VnZjbvgob8g&amp;sig2=ZaZ_f8lpd8c0EyGzC4XTWw) Then again, that's not what the racist dad in *American History X* said, and he was the dad on ""Boy Meets World""... and how can you argue with Mr. Matthews?  &gt; Only attractive women would ever run the risk of being treated as ""sexy livestock"", the very same thing happens to attractive men.  In the media and in real life, most women, even the ones who don't meet your standards for attractiveness, experience objectification and sexual harassment at a rate not even approaching that for men... I mean, er, well, I say objectification and harassment because I can only *assume* that's what ""sexy livestock"" means... unless it's some kind of 'furry' thing. Or maaaybe it means [state legislators literally referring to women as livestock, as their rationale for legislation forcing them to carry dead fetus corpses inside their bodies for months](http://msmagazine.com/blog/blog/2012/03/31/at-11th-hour-georgia-passes-women-as-livestock-bill/). Or, NO WAIT I GOT IT, maybe it just means sexualization of women in *conjunction* with meat products! In which case, [the Paris Hilton Carl's Jr. hamburger car wash ad](http://money.cnn.com/2005/05/24/news/newsmakers/carls_ad/)! She made livestock *hella* sexy, and she's not even that attractive! Case closed.  &gt; Yes because men are rarely taken seriously when it comes to anything emotional [...] when they want to be a childs father...  Exactly! Like, even though most juries favour split custody if the child spent equal or less time with the child than the mother, apparently judges have the power to declare men ""not the child's father"", a power once previously the sole province of Maury Povich.  &gt; the targets of false allegations  *Exactly*. False rape allegations are a huge problem, even though the incidence of them by women against men aren't statistically insignificant... and I can only assume you meant rape, because that's the typical flashpoint of debate over false accusations of men; though we should also acknowledge, as a society, that men are the target of 99% of false *goatee* allegations. A soul patch is not a goatee, *ladies*!!!  &gt; when they are victims of abuse  **Exactly!** Don't you hate how if a man goes to the police with a case of abuse, the police just laugh in his face, slap him a few times, make fun of his shoes, and then toss him through a door sarcastically marked ""Important Crime Reports"" that actually leads to a back-alley with a brick wall. I mean, *so rude*! And it's not just with reports of domestic abuse; no, it's with crimes where the incidence of male victims is *above* negligible, too! Abuse against old men, young men, little boys, babies, all of it gets the old heave-ho thanks to the ""Cops Only Listen to Women Act"" of 1997. DAMN YOU CLINTON.  &gt; PEOPLE have regarded uppity PEOPLE with contempt for generations, mostly because the vast majority of uppity people have it far better off than most, those who are suffering from real hardships don't have time to be uppity.  Can't argue with that, I dare someone to try. Truly the greatest rethinking of history since Foucault and Marx combined to form *Farx*™. Obviously uppity folks like Martin Luther King, Frederick Douglass, Thomas Jefferson, Thich Quang Duc, Mahatma Gandhi, Harvey Milk, Norma Rae, Erin Brockovich, Spartacus, Jesus Christ, Braveheart, Mad Max, Atticus Finch, Luke Skywalker, Tobey McGuire's character in ""Pleasantville"" — none of them were actually suffering or witnessing any *hardships*, or disadvantaged at all... otherwise they wouldn't have had *time* in their day to be uppity and rebellious!

I'm not an expert, but I'm not just some fanboy who has no idea what he's talking about. I've played them both. I also have Puzzle Strike and Flash Duel (both of which I like)  Yomi's not a bad game. It just feels very... bland and samey. And Cadenza is totally beatable in melee with several characters. You just need to use your yomi to dash his press, and then hit him hard and dodge. Hepzibah and Demitras can do it easily, and smart Hikaru play will crush his stun guard.  And yeah, for the price, Yomi is just not worth it. Some pretty art, I guess. I also like the multiplayer modes in BattleCON. A lot more versatile system in that respect.  Overall, I found Yomi to be conceptually fascinating and actually boring. I found BattleCON conceptually intriguing and actually thrilling. Every move matters... a lot. There are no throwaways or dummy moves just to build your hand.  Reply to Edit: The same 5 top players use the SAME STRATEGY. When I say ""minimal strategies"" (plural) I was referring to number of different winning strategies available. They all seem to boil down to build a giant hand, then drop ubercombos. While the characters vary in how they build that hand, the secret to winning every game of Yomi is having a big hand. Look at your own words. Midori ""focus on building a huge hand"". Rook ""try to build up a huge hand"". Not the case with BattleCON. Not even close. You try the same basic strategy (along the lines of ""build a huge hand"") with 2 different BattleCON characters, and it won't end well.  Poker is skillful. I know this very well, I used to work for the #2 online poker site. But Poker has very restricted strategies. You scan the table, work out your EV, and bet based on that. It's so simple a bot can do it (and frequently does), and when a player does it too well, they get banned for being (mistaken as) a bot. Poker lacks variety.",™

Under this federal school accountability system, a school or district this year met AYP requirements if 87 percent or more of their students passed the state reading/English language arts test; 83 percent of their students passed the state mathematics test; 95 percent of their students participated in the state testing program and, depending on the grade level, had either a 75 percent graduation rate or a 90 percent attendance rate. Twenty-eight percent of Texas districts met these high standards.  These requirements are comparable to Recognized or Exemplary level performance in the 2011 state accountability system. No state ratings are being issued this summer because the accountability system must be retooled to use results of the new State of Texas Assessments of Academic Readiness (STAAR)™.    The state’s request to use a similar approach with the federal system and carry over the 2011 AYP ratings into 2012 as the state transitions to the new testing program was denied by the U.S. Department of Education.  Under the current structure of the No Child Left Behind Act, the passing standards in the federal accountability system must rise to passing rates of 100 percent on the mathematics and reading tests by 2014. This means steep increases in the requirements each year now through 2014.

The epitome of a team jersey for me would be the one from [Quantic](http://i.imgur.com/vY7Yu.jpg). The problems I have with this one is that the decorative Protoss theme takes away focus from the Cynical Brit logo and makes the jersey flashy in general, so it's cramped and bleak at the same time. The gradients withing the Protoss logo don't help it at all, Zooc can do a lot better. The blue spikes are unnecessary and cramp space around the main logo. The orange thingy around the neck is too detailed and not pretty.  I think you guys can keep the Protoss theme but make it more subtle and less out-front. The hexagon pattern is a win, it would be ideal with a radial gradient that's brighter towards the center so it brings attention to teh Cynical logo.  Sooo.. yeah. You asked for specifics. ♥ TB",♥

t5_2rmnf,nonsequitur1979,1344666451,"Yeah, nutjobs are endemic wherever you go.   You want to see rednecks, come to the Upper Valley where we primarily stock several varieties of Redneck Lite™:  #1: The Jeff-Foxworthy-wannabes- (my least favorite, simply because they are unoriginal and don't have a real identity) whose entire personality and sense of humor is directly copied from the ""Redneck Humor"" genre frequently featured on Comedy Central, practically verbatim.  They often pretend to be racist because they think it's edgy (not because they actually believe it and it was ingrained as in Southern varieties) but they tend to wither quickly when confronted with logic or the stink-eye. Usually could be described as socially conservative if not in a campy kind of way.  Found primarily in middle and lower class social strata.  #2: The classic Woodchuck (my favorite).  Minds their own business, typically works their ass off for a living, is not necessarily tied to one end of the political spectrum or the other fiscally or socially, can usually read people and their intentions way better than they let on, often more educated than they let on, views tourists and outsiders with bemused detachment.  Social strata varies.  I was once surprised to meet one who was filthy rich but you'd never know it.  He was very grounded and got his money by being a savvy, upstanding businessman and working his ass off.    #3: The ranting whacko:  mixed bag of complete WTF, thankfully rare but every town seems to have at least a handful,  practically embodies the most extreme possible conservative views,  ultra-nationalist, usually very misogynist/sexist, as a result has never been able to keep a female in their life, pretty much hates everyone and all of society, often quite smart but their talents are utterly wasted because they refuse to take that medicine which stops the voices, often doesn't like Republicans because they aren't conservative enough for their views but tends to like the more extreme elements of the party as well as a vast assortment of authors of conspiracy theory books. Likely maintains shrine to Bill O'Reilly in their attic. Often sympathetic to the Nazis. Social strata?... no attachments as they are isolationist and think that there will be no social classes once the Sasquatch-Pope-Alien-Illuminati conspiracy turns us all into mindless zombie cyborgs via fluoride in the drinking water.  Typically believes in racial separation.  Usually found working unloading bays/stock rooms at Walmart or hidden away in factory assembly-lines as their outspoken views and lack of a filter make them a bit unemployable in professions where one deals directly with the general public. Often known to believe in Bigfoot and get abducted by aliens.  Though unfortunate and likely mentally ill, this is ALMOST my favorite type because they are cheap fodder for throwing friendly barbs at some of my Republican-identified friends *a la* *""Y'know what, you guys can totally keep that one.  They're good for your image, right?  X-D ""* which usually earns me equally friendly harassment about some whacko who also happens to identify as liberal/democrat.  #Bonus: Transplanted Real Southern Rednecks™ - I was raised around this variety in my family's church groups.  As such, I humbly admit that as a result I now constantly struggle not to prejudge someone whenever I hear a southern accent.  If not up here in association with a religious group who has come to save us heathen New Englanders from ourselves, they usually come up to the area to escape heat or were the victim of a bad economy/weather disaster/circumstances down South.  Often quite racist but more subtle than what you tend to see on TV.  As with any social group, some are not racist and don't match the stereotype.  Can possess a disquieting knack for pretending to be syrupy sweet &amp; nice while secretly looking down their nose at you and your silly New England culture full of liberals, might even hate your guts without you even knowing it.  Often perplexed by New England Republicans as they are typically seen as being more liberal than the most liberal of Southern Democrats. Often rabidly adopted as mentors by variety #1 who fall over themselves to be able to see one in the flesh and worship appropriately.  Sometimes they are disappointed because it doesn't match the image on Comedy Central.  Also often mistrusted by variety #3 because they don't trust anyone who isn't a 2,000th-generation pasty-white townie into tinfoil-hat coordinated fashions.  Can often be found keeping company with variety #2 if they aren't racist or their racism isn't too overt and they are genuinely friendly.   Granted, these are only the main varieties I've observed.  There are hybrids and variations of these all over the spectrum and properly refined, specific nomenclature is virtually impossible given current scientific standards.   *Edit: sentence structure, details, dammit it's late and I can't sleep.

t5_2qh2p,ChemicalSerenity,1344667045,"&gt; the board becomes stagnant and petulant  Clearly, we're not looking at the same subreddit. Turn off [top] and try [new] sometime.  &gt; this board is filled with militant atheists  ONOES! [The dreaded militant atheists!](http://madmikesamerica.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/atheistscartoons.jpg)  &gt; Athiesm has nothing to do with science, or queers, or any of that other shit. Atheism is a theological belief in the lack of a deity.   All true... and if this subreddit was limited purely to discussions of theological belief (or more specifically, the lack thereof) that'd be an interesting point.  [But it isn't, so it isn't.](http://i.imgur.com/3mfBb.png)  &gt; There is no &lt;insert long list of isn'ts that actually are but I'm too lazy to look for&gt;  Turn off [top], turn on [new], re-evaluate.  &gt; The board needs moderation or it will suffer.  The board is inanimate. It won't suffer one way or the other. In the case of those mouth breathing neckbeards who figure they have the One True Way of Atheism™ and are all upset that everyone else doesn't fall in line, I'm really not all that concerned about them. They're not relevant, and clearly their opinions haven't any weight on any matter of importance. Haters, as they say, gonna hate... and their inchoate rage is often highly amusing.  Ultimately, what you go looking for is probably what you're going to find. I pass over the memes and facebook posts (although I often read and chuckle at them) and I engage in conversations that actually interest me. As a result, I regularly find interesting and entertaining people from diverse backgrounds to interact with in a meaningful way. Someone else coming in with glasses covered in shit is going to walk away having seen, surprise surprise, nothing but shit the entire time. I can't fix their broken perceptions, and their malinformed opinions have no real weight when I routinely disprove them with the conversations I personally have, so... not much to say.

t5_2qi58,CM816,1344667446,"&gt; Arsenal (Wenger) tend to take risks on younger players who aren't relatively known.  I was assuming this was the case, and it's drawing me to support Arsenal.  My most hated pro sports cliche is that a player is/isn't Proven™... or that a guy has/doesn't have a Track Record™.  I admire organizations that focus on good scouting and player development.  Disclaimer: I'm an American who's only very recently really getting into football.  I know enough to know that Arsenal was once very star-laden (&amp; maybe expensive?) but I'm a native Wisconsinite and obvious Green Bay Packers fan, and the Packers' GM has an approach that sounds very similar to Arsenal's of late -- forgoing expensive free agent contracts (closest NFL comparison to expensive transfer fees) to build through the draft and unsigned rookie free agents (cheap contracts).",™

You're also failing to understand that it's not about people's One True Way of Atheism™, it's about you and this board being annoying eyesores.

t5_2qi58,CM816,1344667840,"&gt; My point is, Arsenal cherry picks the best youngsters from other academies, players who the other teams scouted, trained and nurtured from ages as young as 8 or 9. Identifying talent at such a young age, nurturing players, and bringing them up is hard work. At the age where Arsenal scouts them, their foundations would have been laid, their talents more or less obvious.  I see what you're getting at with this; upvoted because I don't think you deserve downvotes.  However, I do still admire the strategy in these moves from Arsenal.  Instead of waiting until players are super-expensive with Track Records™ of being Proven Performers™ (aka veterans), they aim to buy players &amp; possess them through their breakout seasons &amp; then flip them if necessary.  At least, that's how it appears to me in this relatively short discussion.  EDIT: &gt; The whole thing is a business. Arsenal are the middle sized fish that eat the smaller fish, but get eaten when the sharks come hunting.  I think they appear to be eating the *right* smaller fish, however, for which they do deserve credit in terms of their scouting department.",™

Iran has produce hundreds, maybe thousands of Shahab-3 (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shahab-3) missiles with a range of ~2,000 Kl. putting every inch of the Pierson gulf in range from the most distant/remote/un-finedable launching spots in Iran. They are mobile. (All Israel can be hit from more than half of Iran.) **The warheads maneuver, making a non-ballistic flight path** and any ballistic anti-missile missile (Patriot, Iron dome, Arrow,) worthless against them. (Admittedly, this feature has reduced their accuracy to the point only ~ 3 of 4 strike the intended target.)   Israel sold upgrades to Iran... airframes from France, seeker-heads from Israel, and motors from Texas to make missiles the USN is defenseless against. http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=92a_1268399176 These are now in mass production and very cheep to produce. (You should plan on Iran having about 100 of these missiles for every US ship in the area.)

If there were a war, it will make Peal Harbor look like a boyscout jamboree and [all five Nuclear sites in Israel](http://www.atomicarchive.com/Almanac/IsraeliFacilities.shtml) will be turned to powder and sprinkled all over the place. Every military plane that takes off to strike Iran will have no place other than a highway straightaway to land on, (Rearming it won't be easy.) as runways are the proverbial ""sitting duck"".  ...  There is a lot of talk about Iran closing the straits of Hormuz.  If Iran is attacked, they will destroy every oil terminal, pipeline, platform and tanker within 2,000 kilometers.  There will be nothing left to ship through the straits!  *Insurance costs not withstanding☺*  See: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TcqVCEoQn8 22:07  There will be few oil shipments from the gulf for six months to years after hostilities have stopped. (Russia, stop drooling.)  ...  In the event of war with Iran, Pakistan will side with Iran.  See: http://indiandefenceboard.com/threads/pakistan-to-back-iran-in-event-of-war.1202/  Afghanistan can ask Pakistan to Nuke US bases in Afghanistan and that would not be an act of war on any other country.

t5_2snuc,vinterstum,1344736905,"&gt;This interpretation of ""inspired"" as meaning something akin to ""whispered the words into the ears of"" as opposed to the usual secular meaning of the word inspired, is a fairly new one. Inspired means inspired, not co-written. I agree that the terms are often misused by the uneducated.  What percentage of Christians who believe the bible was ""inspired"" by God believe it in the secular way vs as you put very well ""co-written""?  In that poll you posted, how many of those people from the ""inspired"" category should effectively be moved to the ""actual"" category.  You yourself say that the word has been changed across large swaths of Christianity (the uneducated).    I would be curious to see how that effects the numbers.  I contend that you'd probably be a little terrified to see how this effects not only the foundation of people's belief, but also subsequently the way they vote in America, and thusly having great effect on the rest of the world.  It's a real issue not just a doctrinal one.  I don't think we're too far away from each other on this point.  Though I don't personally see any evidence that it was inspired by God, I won't argue that it's a beautiful and important book to be read and studied as part of an essential cannon of great literary works.  &gt;I understand your point. Because ""for all people"" includes people who don't bother to learn the theology past the buzz words, we've got a problem.  Small point here, but important.  Many of those uneducated are ignorant by choice.  However, there are many who simply don't have the intellectual capacity, no matter how much they would desire to dig deep - my mentally handicapped aunt for one.  She can read, but the Bible will forever fill her with consternation, despite an ernest desire to understand it.  That's an obvious example, but you'll have to concede at least a sizable portion of those who don't understand the context COULDN'T understand the context.  This is a big problem for those who claim literalism and universal applicability, but obviously this isn't you.  &gt;What do you propose the solution to be? Limiting access to the Bible is like saying that because most people misunderstand the real meaning of phrases like ""freedom of speech"" and 'the right to bear arms"", we shouldn't publish the U.S. Constitution?  I think that the solution is to make it really clear that the Bible, like the Constitution, is just a compilation of the writings of men and has no authority beyond that of any other book.  And like the constitution, the ideas should and must be scrutinized and even open to being amended if one is going to use it as a life guiding text.  &gt;People doing things in God's name should reflect poorly on those people, not on God.  I was very careful to say ""not only in God's name but because of"".  That's an important distinction.  ""There are good people who do good things and bad people who do bad things.  But for good people to do bad things, for that you need religion."" ~ Steven Weinberg  &gt;I place no such limits on God's power, but I do accept that there are limits to the usefulness of books, even great books like the Bible. The Bible itself is NOT divine. Treating the Bible as if it were equal to God is idolatry.  Very well said.  And Brave.  Side note, totally unrelated, did you ever hold a different opinion or belief?  &gt;You seem pleased with yourself. I'm glad you're enjoying this.  Enjoying myself so much!  &gt;The Bible is not God. Even the good parts of the Bible come from unevolved, unscientific whatever-you-said.  I’m not sure why what we’re debating anymore ☹.  We really should just be having a beer or something.  (Seriously, if you’re ever in LA.)  &gt;There are the interesting questions! … Assuming all of that…  We’re moving into a totally different debate if we follow this bunny train, but I refer you to Epicurus, if you haven’t read him.  “Is God willing to prevent evil, but not able? Then he is not omnipotent. Is he able, but not willing? Then he is malevolent. Is he both able and willing? Then whence cometh evil? Is he neither able nor willing? Then why call him God?”   &gt;Education gets us around that problem, just like it does in the secular world.  I would contend that that it doesn’t get around the immoral preachments of the Bible, but that’s a different thread.  In this one, we both agree that the Bible is for everyone insofar as books are for everyone.  &gt;That's where the other documents come in.   I’m not sure how the Barman Declaration is a point. It’s undisputed that the first alliance formed by the Nazi party was with the Vatican who continued to support fascism throughout the war and is complicit in the atrocities.  If there were other Christians outside the Nazi party who disagreed, this speaks to my point that at the very least a lack of clarity points to man’s hand in the creation of the text.  We totally agree on this though, so hugs!  &gt;You place a lot more faith in what ""most people say"" than I do.  I place a lot of weight in the power of ideas.  I don’t believe in the precepts of any religion, so what adherents (especially progenitors) say about their own religions is important for me to understand them, especially since there is no central text that can be agreed upon universally.  I must refer then to opinions in order to form opinions about various beliefs.  &gt;I didn't think it was very supportive of your implication that the majority of Christendom held that view.  You started this post by agreeing that many uneducated Christians use the word “inspired” differently than you or I would.  I wish Gallup would poll Christians on whether they believe any of the writings of the Bible are evil if adhered to.  I’m pretty sure you’d see a dramatically different poll.  What people think is not important to me in terms of forming opinions – ideas are important, but not how many or who agrees with them.  For the purposes of debating specific beliefs, it’s important to have defining parameters as much as possible.  In this thread, I was challenging those who believe the Bible is inherent – I guess I just got into it with someone who doesn’t hold to this but somehow still claims Christianity. ",☹

t5_2qh7l,andero,1344842826,"**Five dried grams in silent darkness.** Or so it started. I went for the ""heroic dose"". I ground it up in a coffee grinder, then had the massive effort of swallowing it down in sips followed by gulps of lemon-water to avoid vomiting. Happily, that was the worst part of the trip.  I had resolved to take trip in silent darkness. After a while of laying in my bed, silent, dark, I was having closed-eyed visuals. Kaleidoscopic imagery. A dog barked outside. I was too cold. My breathing was too laboured. I was bored with the imagery. ""Really mushroom?"" I thought, ""I am kinda disappointed. I expected more."" The message: This is life. There is no time-out. This is life. Ongoing experience. And what was wrong here? I wanted to be warmer and I wanted to breath better. So I got up with the resolve to exercise-bike.  I passed by one of my roommates before she left. I had told her I would be taking 5gs. She was an intense person to see. Her face was tiled on the walls (an experience I had with another friend years earlier on 4gs). She left and I had the house to myself, plus her two cats and my other roommate's cat. I exercised, and I wrote...  * The influences acting everywhere are immense. I mean in terms of psychology or sociological distinctions. Even the most seemingly minute influence. The slightest thing we do not suspect affects our reasoning, including the unpleasantness of the dog barking outside, they do affect us. Immensely. * The trip was a balancing act. Progression and conservation. The drive to conserve the good things in life can be difficult to overcome as the satisfaction of progress comes only at the end of a great deal of output energy. Conservation can become a trap of inactivity. Procrastination is without merit. Tiredness becomes conservatism. * Every moment of life is a question of where focus centres. * My roommate's cats were digging around in my past by being physically behind me. **Cats will fuck with you**. Cat-food really does stink. * There was a blurring between stimuli and awareness. Between moments of awe, the awareness was distinct in place and time. The present goes back to fill in the blanks. [I could watch it re-write history] * This whole uncertainty principle is brilliant. One can only be distinct by motion xor location. Slowing down ends communication. * [I wrote a lot in reverse, backward letters scrawled in black ink, so it is hard to tell sometimes what I wrote] * Introspection is such bullshit. The doer simply gets distracted because the ∞ is just so beautiful it gives up in haste * When nice things are done for you, it is nice to appreciate them♥ And to reciprocate♥ [putting in that progressive effort] * We are each our own life: finite continuity within an undifferentiated multitude. * [on a person I loved] It was something beautiful before you came along and tried to make it something beautiful. It is not that trying to make something beautiful is wrong. It was not-noticing that it was beautiful all along and trying to change it into something beautiful that it wasn't. [This still echoes today!] * The suffering by lack of another does not heed turning a blind eye [Not paying attention does not make that suffering go away] * * Religion is the stupifying wonder that makes you food. * * Science is the process of figuring out what food is, good food, what 'good' means, what 'healthy' means, and how to go about obtaining these things in the most effective way possible (which may, and should, involve some stupifying wonder.) ((at least parenthetically)) * Being a good person involves taking care of things as well as being there for others, regardless of the sounds made or fluids expelled * Life is cats. Relationships are cats. The currency of life is simple pleasures (petting, warmth, and feeding) [I spent the trip with cats, OK!]  I also spent a great deal of time slicing and eating a tomato, stopping to peer into its flesh or the trees outside.  Overall, amazing, but mundane. This is life. Ongoing. On mushrooms, off mushrooms, this is life.",♥
t5_2qh2p,Light-of-Aiur,1344843264,"Eh... I knew I wasn't heterosexual back when I was in Catholic school, but I still liked the church atmosphere and was very good friends with some of my teachers and priests. I didn't want to disappoint them, or my family, so I kept going and kept trying to ""figure out"" what all the hullabaloo was about.  I did the whole thing: went to church, confession, confirmation... Hell, I was an alter server *and* a Eucharist administer (those lay people that pass out the Christ Crackers^™ during mass). Never found the faith, eventually gave up on it.   I think, then, that others in similar circumstances will ignore the teachings of the papacy and stay in the church to be with friends and family.

t5_2s3jo,manlycaveman,1344861071,"1. Different worlds can have different default drop levels. Like the drop gauge drops faster than normal in the last world. If you're ever put to sleep by an enemy then the gauge speed will increase. In a couple worlds there are areas with a pink/purplish mist that increases the drop rate if you touch it. I think Drop-Me-Not and Drop-Me-Never items may reset the drop rate back to default in addition to adding back some of the meter, but I didn't really pay attention to that.   2. Link points are gained by fighting along side the spirits in your party, petting them in the spirits menu, feeding them, or by using water barrels. Water Barrels are the fastest way to get points it seems.  3. You keep all attack skills, magic skills, support abilities (red circle icon), and spirit abilities (purple circle icon) after unlocking them. The passive stat boosts like HP Boost and Attack Haste are only equipped when the dream eater that has them unlocked is in your party.  4. The ""♥(5/5)"" thing is the affection/affinity level. The higher it is, the more your dream eater will help you in battle. Max level is 9. The pink bar is just the ""heart points"" for the next affinity level. As you pet, feed, use a balloon item, and stuff you get the heart points that increase the pink bar. When the bar is full the max affinity level goes up by 1 (until it reaches 9).   Dispositions change which skills your dream eater knows and the spirit's behavior in battle. For example: there's a disposition for the spirit Sudo Neku that makes it go into berserk mode immediately after entering battle (""psycho"" or something). You can check out the skills the spirits in your party have by going into the ""Stats"" menu, selecting a spirit, and then touching the bottom screen. The screen will switch and show all of their current skills.",♥

With the 10 meter dive's last day: under 850 people were logged in and watching the best nail-biter of the whole games. The footage online had zero commentary, just the video with graphics.  It wasn't live on any of the NBC TV networks. In fact, there was a lot of duplication going on: the basketball and soccer channels would show games also playing on CNBC and MSNBC.    So after it was clear that USA!™ had won gold in the final dive, they made it the leading footage of that night's Primetime coverage.

t5_2qh1i,kaihatsusha,1344883100," Every country has this.  I grew up in southern Arizona, so I knew what was *real* Mexican food, and what was *gringo* Mexican food.  Gringo Mexican is when you use a lot of salsa, cream cheese, and bland flour tortillas that have never been on a grill.  Taco Bell is an excellent example of Gringo Mexican.  I later moved to Seattle.  There was a taco chain there (probably still is) called **Taco Time**.  Now this place was even more gringo than Taco Bell, if that is possible.  The proof:  they sold Ore-Ida Tater-Tots® (you know Ore-Ida, named after Oregon and Idaho potatoes) but they labeled them **Mexi-Fries**.  I just about died laughing.  The Hawaiian Beni-Hana chain popularized Japanese hibachi/teppanyaki cooking in America.  Not really a thing in Japan.  I've tried American-style Chinese food in Puerto Rico... quite different from food made by Chinese families for themselves.  Then again, sometimes these things catch on.

Each session is supposed to last about 600 hours, but a lot of them have something really wrong with them; the one that the comic centers on for the most part takes under a day (unless you discount the time-traveling, which took like 4 days then). Lord English here is either directly or indirectly behind every event that led to this massive failure. The only words we've ever heard him speak are ""HOW CAN YOU OUTRUN ME... WHEN I'M ALREADY HERE?"" He's famous for killing the author and, most recently, to the shock and horror of the entire fandom, then descending into the afterlife to permanently kill everyone who was already peacefully dead.   Most of the comic takes the format of panels with moving GIFs on them, usually subtitled by a large amount of words (sometimes enclosed in a ""pesterlog"", which is an IM transcript that reads like the script to a play). Occasionally there are Adobe Flash^© animations like the one I showed you that are really cool. [Some of them are games.](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/index.php?s=6&amp;p=004692) They're all really anticipated.

t5_2r0gj,iambookus,1344914179,"Got a point there.   Mormons have programs designed to spread the word including a missionary force.  Just yesterday the Armies of Helaman song came to mind in relation to this thread.    &gt;1. We have been born, as Nephi of old,  &gt;To goodly parents who love the Lord.  &gt;We have been taught, and we understand,  &gt;That we must do as the Lord commands.   &gt;2. We have been saved for these latter days  &gt;To build the kingdom in righteous ways.  &gt;We hear the words our prophet declares:  &gt;“Let each who’s worthy go forth and share.”   &gt;3. We know his plan, and we will prepare,  &gt;Increase our knowledge through study and prayer.  &gt;**Daily we’ll learn until we are called**  &gt;**To take the gospel to all the world.**   Chorus   &gt;We are as the army of Helaman.  &gt;We have been taught in our youth.  &gt;**And we will be the Lord’s missionaries**  &gt;**To bring the world his truth.**   Words and music: Janice Kapp Perry, b. 1938 © 1983 by Janice Kapp Perry. This song may be copied for incidental, noncommercial church or home use.   As you can you see, the Church wants it's members to spread the message, and indoctrinates them to spread the message.   So am I asking for tolerance?   Not for them spreading the message if we don't want to hear it.  But tolerance for them to believe what they want away from us?  If that makes any sense.    The way I see it, I want to educate the ignorant.   I want them to see the light.  My family is still giving them their time and money, and it bugs the crap out of me.   They know I no longer believe as well.    However, my family is not on a mission to force me to believe, and they let me do as I like.  In reciprocation, I don't shove my nonbelief down their throats.    I agree with your defintions of strident vs nonstrident.   Going to r/lds and raising hell with fuck joseph statements is totally wrong.   Contrary facts are perfectly OK, and encouraged.   At the same time, I personally believe there's a place for it.   If someone quotes the prophets on my facebook wall, it's open season.  They put it out there so I can refute to my hearts content.  Uninvited arguments or contrary facts no matter how well thought out, will strengthen cognitive dissonance.    When they post publicly, they are inviting the arguments and contrary facts.    r/lds is a relatively private place, even though it is public, that is reserved to worship the way they like.   I personally believe that's keeping to themselves.   It's their online forum, and what does anyone expect when they go there except to see people praising their religion?  If I go to a gay bar, I expect to see gays.     The Church itself campaigns to bring the message to the world, not individual members.  Albeit, there are certain individual members that publicly exclaim their faith.  If other individual Mormons are tolerant of our nonbelief, then why antagonize them?  Especially when they are not antaganizing us?    **HOWEVER**  On the flipside, I personally believe that any news story, public endeavor, or anything the church does publicly can most certainly be challenged.    They made it public, and I can do the same thing.   Any individual making their opinions public can be challenged as well.    I am by no means asking for silence.   Respecting someone's religious beliefs in my definition is letting them worship as they so choose.  Call it tolerance if you like.   When they ask me worship the same as they do, that's when they are overstepping their boundries, and I can refute anything they say.     What do you think?    ",©

t5_2qgzg,the7thscreen,1344928247,"Research by Towers Watson and workforce mobility association Worldwide ERC® has revealed that multinational organizations are continuing to increase the number of employees that they relocate overseas, despite the fact that they anticipate a number of global mobility challenges.  Of those companies surveyed as part of the research, 45 percent revealed that they would be increasing traditional international assignments, with companies that are based in the U.S. being expected to relocate more employees abroad (54%) than those that are based in Europe (26%) or Asia (43%). However, the ERC 2012 Global Talent Mobility Study also indicated that global mobility is becoming increasingly difficult for many companies. According to information published in The Economist, the cost of relocating employees abroad is becoming an increasing problem, with over 75% of companies claiming that a “traditional” overseas assignment, which usually involves relocating an employee and their family for three to five years) involves expenditure that amounts to two to three times the expat’s annual salary. Of those involved in the survey, 69% cited prohibitive costs as a major challenge, 55% high housing costs and 51% mentioned cost-of-living allowances (51%). Discussing the findings, Peggy Smith, chief executive officer of Worldwide ERC, commented: “Having a fluid and flexible workforce is a key competitive advantage for multinationals operating around the world today.",®

From what I've read, Plex isn't planning on ISO support, so until that changes, I probably won't be using it (which kinda sucks, because I'd love to share the library over the internet and to mobile devices).  I also use WMC and XBMC. WMC is for live TV, recording, and the Netflix app, and XBMC is for my library. ",™
t5_2qzb6,asagohan,1344964572,"I took AP Japanese (second year college Japanese) in school and did pretty well. But after I graduated, I found myself unmotivated when studying independently or with friends. I could only study daily or semi-daily for maybe a few weeks at a stretch. I study like this intermittently, however it is futile from the time wasted relearning forgotten material.  It is the same with disciplines I am interested in: literature, philosophy, math, science, linguistics, french, russian, and such.  It is unsettling and unnerving to be unable to dedicate yourself to something, and to only possess a superficial knowledge apposite for casual conversation.  So, how does one not lose interest or focus, and continue to study in the scope of self-learning?

t5_2qhfg,Baron_von_Noodles,1344971345,"The author just posted this ""uncut version"" of the situation in the post along with his responses to each bit. Hope it helps clear things up.  ""'… currently we observe the situation, when some people use S.T.A.L.K.E.R brand for personal financial enrichment, violating all intellectual property and trademark laws and rights.' This is a bold statement coming from a company who has built a whole game franchise on IP violation. The S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games are only tolerated but not legally approved by Boris Strugatsky, who is the author of ""Roadside Picnic"" and the creator of the whole idea about the Zone, anomalies, artifacts and Stalkers. ""More than year ago the game fan from Hungary asked us to help promoting his first book in English and the website dedicated to this book called S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Southern Comfort, which we did with pleasure.""  Wrong. My very first step was to ask GSC for permission to use their IP such as game quotes etc., and received this permission in writing from GSC.  ""Oleg Yavorskiy, the head of PR department, thus made the announcements on our official and unofficial Internet resources about the book’s website and its future release. When the author put the book on Amazon, we asked him why he started to sell (!) the book without any agreements with GSC Game World as the right-holder."" Very wrong. I exchanged dozens of emails with Yavorsky/GSC about income sharing, royalty structure and even sales through Stalker-shop.com. ""Balash Pataki assured us, that the book like any other fan-content will be available for free, and he used the Amazon only for the convenience of the owners of Kindle. Unfortunately, there is no possibility to share the book for free on the Amazon, but he will keep the minimum price, and if the book is sold well, he will immediately sign a contract with GSC Game World."" Very wrong. As said above, sharing royalties was discussed at lengths with Yavorsky. Our agreement was: until sales reach 1000 copies, I can keep all royalties. Once 1000 copies are sold, we'll discuss how to proceed. It was a bad deal but no matter how hard I pushed for a formal contract, GSC failed to react on this matter. ""Regrettably, Mr. Pataki turned out to be a liar."" Thanks GSC for the perfect occasion to say: ""Let the Zone take me if I'm lying!"" Also, you can worry about paying my daughter's college fee in a few years.  ""Everyone who bought the book can see the writing on the very first page saying: © 2011 GSC Game World and used by courtesy of GSC Game World. All Rights Reserved […] Therefore, there were no free books giveaway, neither there was a low price ($7,5 now) on Amazon."" Got to admit I don't understand what GSC wants to say here. In any case the book copyright page proves that I acted in due diligence, doing my utmost to ensure GSC's IP is respected. ""We discussed this issue with Mr. Pataki several times, but he was first saying that the sales were not more than a few copies per month; and when we received the information on the actual sales, he threatened us to start the massive PR-activity: “the fan is harmed by a big and evil company”."" Very wrong.  1) Oleg Yavorsky and Joe Mullin have been informed about sales and royalties on a regular basis; after GSC ceased to exist as a game developer in December 2011 and Oleg didn't reply to any of my emails, sales reports went to Joe Mullin.  2) Earlier this year, a guy called Sergiy Grushko contacted me through Facebook chat out of the blue and demanded on behalf of GSC that I remove the STALKER logo from my books. This was a tricky situation. On one hand, since GSC has the IP rights, I had to comply. On the other hand however, I knew this would be very bad PR for GSC. I tried to talk Grushko out of this. Part of my efforts was a post on the book's FB page, asking my fans about this. The overwhelming response proved me right. Grushko only remarked: ""I understand your position."" Then GSC went quiet and I, perhaps stupidly, had hoped they really understand that keeping the books as they are would be in GSC's own interest. Moreover, I offered them to share the royalties as it had been agreed with GSC originally but Grushko ignored this. ""In April, he was already selling two books, having not even notified GSC Game World about the release of the second one.""  Wrong. I informed Oleg about the second book in due time but received no reply to this either. Joe Mullin however, as the man in charge of handling the non-Russian fan community, didn't object and promoted both books on the Official STALKER page several times.  ""Now, after several months of negotiations we realized that the author is not going to lower the book’s price, or give out the book for free (as it is normally done with any other fanworks)."" Wrong. After that chat with Grushko no one from GSC had contacted me for months. On 13 August 2012 I realized that FB removed my profile picture ""for copyright infringement"". (It was a painting by an artist specifically made for my book.) I sensed trouble coming and first asked Olga Kuzhel, now in charge of GSC's FB page, who denied any knowledge. Then I asked Grushko who also claimed to know nothing. At the same minute I received an email from Amazon informing me about a copyright infringement claim having been filed against my books, sent by Sergiy Grushko to Amazon on behalf of GSC. When I confronted him with this, he went berserk and accused me of stealing money from GSC and so on. I repeatedly told him: let's discuss this, let's come to an agreement, but don't go down the way you appear to have taken because fans will hate GSC for it, and after all both of us wants to keep fans happy. In the end I offered him to make the books available for free as he demanded but asked to keep the STALKER logo on their cover and the royalties collected so far (talking about the ""massive"" amount of 3700 USD.) I waited and waited for his reaction; he could have offered any reasonable and fair deal to share the royalties, say ""let's forget about it"" or just say no and press on with his demands. Bottom line: I received no reply. Why? Because at the very same moment he was busily typing the defaming post on the Official Stalker page.   ""We do not want to be considered an incarnation of evil, when we’re caring for equal rights for our fans.[…] if he wants to continue promoting his works, he should do it, sharing his books for free, as the other authors do."" Wrong. As said, the contrary of these statements can be proved. They did not ""request me to remove my books from any sales networks"" but took that step by themselves without consulting me. (Probably they didn't expect Amazon forwarding me their request. I guess GSC is used to a much less transparent business environment.) ""Other authors"" do not have the same agreement I have had with GSC. If Grushko/GSC doesn't know about my agreement with Yavorsky/GSC – sorry that's not my fault and there exists a word such as ""diligence"" for how Grushko/GSC should have proceeded. Not to mention ""public relations"", another word that appears to be missing from GSC's vocabulary.  All in all, it appears to me they never really wanted to settle this in a civilized manner. GSC's real intention is probably something else, related to their recently published ""official"" graphic novel, and one can assume they consider my two STALKER books, though written legally and on a basis of an agreement with GSC, a competitive product that has to be removed.  Matter of fact: the way GSC defamed me in front of 30 000 game fans, many of them friends of mine, was unnecessary, unprovoked and totally inappropriate. Hence I will file a legal charge against GSC for defamation, asking for non-damage compensation at an amount considered reasonable by US courts in California where cases involving defamation and libel committed on Facebook are settled.""",©

The point of the exchange was this:                              You made the statement that FL was ""rock solid GOP""^® and I challenged            that statement.    I provided solid facts to back up my challenge.  You instead blatantly chose to ignore the facts provided and the logical questions posed to you, and deflected with hollow rhetoric about whether or not the ""messiah"" would win FL this go 'round, and ""desperation"" &amp; ""excuses"".    So address the facts:  FL is has a majority Democrat voter base, voted for Obama in 2008, and has earned the title of ""swing state"" for legitimate reasons.  Don't reply with bullshit answers about the 2010 mid-term elections, which have been well established by anyone with more than one active brain cell as a nationwide combination of Democratic voter apathy and well organized (and corporate backed) Republican organizing.  That has no bearing on the majority Democratic registration of FL's voters, the closeness of past presidential elections, and FL's designation as a swing state.  Did you get all that or shall I repeat it?  Just in case...  • FL is a swing state - please look up that term.   • FL has a majority Democrat voter base - please use the link provided (above) to see for yourself.   • ALL 2010 mid-term elections NATIONWIDE (including other swing states) reflected DEM voter apathy and strong GOP organizing.

I think electing a huge GOP contingent to almost every elected office in the state is a pretty big change.*    It happened nationwide, and there was a clear reason (which I've pointed out ad-nauseum).  ONE change (even a big one) doesn't make a state with a largely divided electorate no longer a swing state.  Nice try though.  &gt;*Yes, Dem's have a grand total of 500k-ish more registered voters than Republicans.*    Again, the numbers thing is a weak point for you.  500K out of 9.7 million (only GOP and DEM) is a pretty big majority difference.    &gt;*...you'll be the one with your mouth agape on election day trying to decide which country you want to say you're moving to.*    You mean like the way Rush Limbaugh moved to Costa Rica when Obamacare was ruled constitutional?  Yeah, about that.  You see I'd never leave because I know this is the greatest nation on earth and I'll fight tooth and nail not to let right wing extremists ruin it.  I'll never give up on the US.  :)  &gt;*It's funny how you ignore the 2.9 million independents in the state, maybe that's because Obama is shedding independents at a break neck speed?*    Ha!  You may be surprised to know that my voter registration card reads ""NPA"" (no party affiliation).  In fact I was unable to vote in today's local primary elections because of this (FL has a closed primary system).  You know I almost DID mention the independent and ""3rd party"" voters, but to debunk your naive claim about FL being ""rock solid GOP""^® all I needed was to prove a minority status for the Republican voters.    Something you (and some of my genuine right wing friends - and I do have some very good right wing friends) don't seem to get is that we progressives are not thrilled with Obama, but he's a damned sight better than Bush, McCain, and **ANY** of the 2012 GOP candidates.  There are a lot of areas we progressives are critical of the president on, but we also know that he's done a lot of good too.  &gt;*It's cute how you keep acting like these 2 factors are no longer an issue.*    It's cute how you assign your own meanings to clear statements.  I never *EVER* said any such thing.  I never said these points were unimportant now or not an issue.  You, however, decided to revise the narrative.  I simply addressed the issue **multiple times** SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THE 2010 MID-TERM ELECTIONS.  Sorry, not sure if you're eyes are ""deaf"", so I wanted to be clear (*once again*).  In fact, if you want to discuss it beyond the 2010 mid-terms, I'll be happy to let you know that I have said for years and I *still* say, the GOP is one well oiled machine when it comes to organizing and staying ""on message.""  The DEM party is the exact opposite.  They're fucking terrible at it.  Jesus, if they had half the organizing discipline and skill of the GOP they'd be unstoppable.    edit: almost forgot, you're emotional",®

How much does it cost?  $3.99 / month, if you choose to go month-to-month.  For a limited time, we're also offering a yearly subscription option for $29.99, which works out to $2.49 / month. Do I need a PayPal / Google Checkout account?  If you have one, you can use it. But if you don't, and you don't want to create one, you don't have to. Make a onetime PayPal payment and look for this link on the subscription form. So how do I do this? To buy reddit gold, just visit reddit.com/gold. Is there any other way to join?

The panels can be a bit trickier to find at reasonable prices, but here's [one](http://www.amazon.com/Instapark®-Black-Mono-crystalline-Solar-Panel/dp/B004FX10ES/).    If 15W isn't enough to keep the battery going with all your accessories, Harbor freight sells a full-on 45W kit for about $170.  However it's probably a lot more than you'd really need.  You can get panels in less than 15W, but it needs to be able to charge the battery up durring it's (we'll assume here) 10 hours of usable light. You'll probably want to do some actual math on how much you're using.   Your typical lead acid battery varries from 12-14.2V, and could go up to 17+ when it's charging (i'm not exactly sure on the circuitry inside the charge controllers).  So make sure whatever 5V regulator you're using can keep up with your current draw. ",®

t5_2qhos,dusdus,1345060234,"I actually kind of agree with you about phonology -- I'm not really sure what kinds of questions mainstream generativist phonology is answering, and there's been a bit of a backlash in the generative community against OT and the like. I rarely deal with phonology myself, so to me, I think it'd be a no-loss game if we got rid of any notion of phonology in UG. But I'm sure a person who does generative phonology would have a very different opinion ;)  On one hand, I know where you're coming from -- if we treated Chomsky '55 on the same level of scientific rigor as we hold, say, Darwinian theory of evolution, modern syntactic research would be seen as totally incomprehensible. On the other hand, I'd like to think we're a very young field, and that we are making forward progress, as one does in any kind of science, and our methodologies are evolving along with the questions, so there is lots of room for revolution and revisions (after all, in Chomsky's own writings, there are probably 4 or 5 substantially different iterations of the generative enterprise that, to a person not deep in the syntax literature, look completely different). I personally believe that, at least for syntax/semantics, the generative approach is the best to explain acquisition, processing, and typology. And for that reason, the generativist enterprise is a great example of scientific research. (To answer your other question, there are a number of functionalist approaches to syntax that could be considered alternatives to mainstream Minimalism. I really don't see any substantial theoretical insights about the mind or language in those works, personally. There are also lots of non-Chomskyan generative formalisms, but I think that they should be best thought of as competing theories within the same framework. I personally  work within Minimalism, but I enjoy reading work in LFG from time to time, because I think it has an interesting perspective on a lot of issues)  Fwiw, I think the field will start to look very different now that Chomsky isn't quite the Primary Architect of the Theory®. I imagine that paradoxically a lot of his ideas will probably be more accepted and altered and fit with what we know about the rest of the brain, since a lot of his ideas won't be seen as ""Chomskyan"" anymore, but evaluated and modified in the same way as any good scientific idea should be.",®

Pfrimmer is just one of the tools in the toolbox that I use, although we never learned it as being called that. It sounds like it's just cross fiber intermuscular techniques.   To be really honest, statements like this: *""Pfrimmer Deep Muscle Therapy® works for the correction and prevention of serious muscle conditions such as ALS, Multiple Sclerosis, Muscular Dystrophy, Parkinson's, Cerebral Palsy, brain injury and stroke""* ([source](http://www.pfrimmer.org/)) make me really nervous. There's no citations, I've never read any studies on this (although I haven't read every study ever, so I obviously can't say that it's not out there), and none of the 10 or so RMT's I know who specialize in neurological pathologies have mentioned this technique. Also, almost all of the pathologies this technique claims to prevent are hereditary or idiopathic.   ALS: Idiopathic  Multiple Sclerosis: Genetic component, usually idiopathic  Muscular Dystrophy; Genetic component, idiopathic, usually shows up in childhood  Parkinson's: Idiopathic  Cerebral Palsy: Childhood/in-utero trauma, idiopathic  Brain Injury: Trauma  None of those things can actually be scientifically proven to be prevented by massage, so that claim bothers me. It's very circumstantial evidence. It's like saying, ""I've been doing this work on all these people and none of them got parkinsons, so this must prevent parkinsons!"" Well.... maybe, but probably not.   *Aaaaanyway*, it looks like it's just intermuscular cross fiber work following a particular methodology that someone developed. My advice is to learn your basic swedish techniques because you can use those for relaxation or intense therapeutic work, and develop your palpation skills before doing this sort of slightly specialized deep work, or you can hurt someone.   Sorry for the rant. I'm a person who needs me some citations. If you have some research or anything for this technique, please send it to me and I'll eat my words!     ",®

Many of my friends are fully signed up, self-righteous, members of the Vegan Police™. I understand this shit.   I notice there is at least one course with cheese so hopefully people won't be too picky. And the dessert at least will have egg binding the pastry? So that makes things easier. Try and stay away from Isinglass if you can help it (fish isn't actually a vegetable, eh) but if there is nothing reasonable in the style you are looking for then I shouldn't worry too much. However if you do manage to find some Vegan/Organic/Sustainable wines I'm sure the gesture would be appreciated.   I am still fairly new to wine geekery, and not to flash on this whole food matching business. Especially not with US specific varietals. Still. Feel free to ignore me. :)   The soup: The beetroot could be a problem. I would worry that a Rose would get lost against strong flavours like that. Maybe something a bit punchy-er? I would be almost be looking Australian. Cabernet rather than Shiraz for the earthyness. (Do you get Yalumba over there? Most their range are Vegan now)   The Crackers/Dip: Depends what is in the dip. A good savoury Pinot Noir seems like a great idea with the crackers though. I can't comment on Oregon, but Central Otago for sure.   Cabbage Slaw: Yep. Or Pinot Gris / Gewurtz? Something aromatic anyway. Sauvignon depends hugely on the style but if you get the right one... (Marlborough?)   Rolls: Seems like there is a lot going on there so something a little bit more restrained like a Merlot (with a dash of Malbec?) or a GSM is the go.

Four alleged militants died in a 4.30am attack when a bakery was struck in Miranshah bazaar, North Waziristan. According to Associated Press the victims – all ‘foreigners’ or ‘Arabs’ – were buying bread when the shop was bombed, marking a rare deliberate targeting of civilian infrastructure. Other agencies reported that a house was struck., or that the target was an apartment above the bakery. All reported that the building was destroyed.  So you can see they're relying on Associated Press here.  &gt; In the first reported CIA action in South Waziristan since March 13, up to four people were reported killed in a strike targeting  a vehicle in Khawashi Khel, 5km to the east of Wana. Security officials told AFP that alleged militants had been moving from one area to another near the Afghan border, and that ‘the US drone fired two missiles which completely destroyed the vehicle.’ Two local militant leaders were reported killed, both members of Maulvi Nazir’s Taliban-aligned faction.

It was a terribly worded release statement by Intel that caused much confusion in the tech world.  Edit: Since I know I'm going to get asked for a source... Intel seems to have removed the FAQ that addressed this.  It WAS located [here](http://www.intel.com/p/en_us/support/highlights/chpsts/imsm/sb/cs-031491.htm).  Here is the clarifying relevant text from that.  &gt;Intel® RST 9.6 will be released this week which includes TRIM support for SSDs. It will support TRIM with SSDs in an AHCI configuration, or with the RAID controller enabled and the SSD is used as a pass through device. An example of this use case is for users that want to use the SSD as a boot drive but still be able to RAID multiple HDDs together to allow for large protect data storage – a great use for the home theater PC. TRIM support for SSDs in a RAID configuration is under investigation and is not included in Intel® RST 9.6.",®

t5_2cneq,sheasie,1345212509,"I actually wrote about this topic as (essentially) **""the liberal's response to Grover Norquist"":**  Republicans are all about ""taxes"".  Fine.  That's a critical issue, I agree.  Conversely, I think the Democrats should be all about ""democracy"" -- fitting, by title (i.e., ""Democrats"").  And like ""taxes"", ""Democracy"" is also a critical issue that most (if not all Democrats) agree on.  So here's the pledge:  **PLEDGE:  I pledge to never limit an American's ability to vote.  One American. One Vote.™**    (vs. Gover's ""I pledge to never raise taxes."")  Failure to sign would result in targeted SuperPAC ads branding you as being ""trying to take-away your Right to vote"", or ""willing to rig elections"" (it could even be argued.)  So rather than deal with the potential attacks in the upcoming election, it's better to sign the pledge.  (Sure it's political blackmail -- just as Norquist's pledge is political blackmail, but why not... the ""One American One Vote"" pledge is way more reasonable than ""Never Raise Taxes"".)  So of course you eventually get all the Dems to sign the pledge (just as Norquist got all the Repubs to sign his).  Bonus if you could catch a couple of sleazy Republicans on video scoffing at that pledge. (That would be sweet nectar.)  **BOTTOM LINE:**  Everyone knows... that the more people who vote, the more likely ""liberal"" agendas will prevail.  (Which is why the Republicans are always trying to limit and effectively kill democracy.)  At the end of the day, the pledge would prevail and it would be effective, in that it will become easier for people to vote, and as more people vote, a Democratic (aka ""liberal"") agenda will prevail by nature.

t5_2sfmf,lasting_throwaway,1345222630,"&gt; Sure, monopolies are bad. Most monopolies are the result of state intervention that raises barriers to entry for small firms.  It's The State's Fault And Not The Natural Cause Of Laissez-Faire Capitalism™  Sure, because creating a free capitalist market would single-handedly dismantle the monopoly Monsanto has on agriculture, the oligopoly Microsoft and Apple have on computer OS's, etc.  No, it's not ""the state makes small businesses suffer™"", especially considering how many countries give research grants and tax credits to small investments, rather it's as simple as a case of ""a company is already established in that market and it will do hell if you try to squeeze in there with it"".  &gt; Then why do capitalists currently exist in your view? As I've explained, the reason is that workers typically don't want to take on all that risk.  Capitalists exist because of their very nature of being gamblers with lots of money. Workers are much, much less likely to ""band together"" and create their own co-op, because if their business fails, they will have lost everything and more, possibly leaving them to starve on the streets. Capitalists, being the reckless gamblers they are, simply invest in ""the next big thing"", and if they lose, they still have lots of money left anyways. If they win, they get more money to invest.  Also, you still haven't defined the ""risks"" that the capitalists take which would still be present in a workers' economy.  &gt; If a person goes from having no choices (only starvation as a prospect)--which is the situation of your worker before the capitalist arrives on the scene, to one extra choice (starvation or work in a factory), do you believe his situation has: 1. Improved 2. Stayed the same 3. Worsened  3. Worsened simply by the existence of the capitalist.  I repeat, *again*, that factory builders still need to build factories and workers still need to work inside factories. Trade between the two would naturally happen just like any other commodity (builders build factory, in return get commodities from factory workers), however, we do live in a plutocratic world where only the rich can get richer, so owing due to gamblers' nature of capitalism *only the rich are able to comfortably invest in private property*.  &gt; You're referring to the volatility of state dominated economies.  Give me an explanation as to how economic crises and the boom/bust cycle occur. Just curious.  &gt; Workers are not especially disadvantages by this volatility. They could pool their resources and become capitalists is they wanted to, they chose not to because they are uncomfortable with the risk.  Because if they fail their risk, *they fucking starve*. If a capitalist fails his risk, he can still go on living with what he has left. Sheesh, the tone of your speech almost seems like a rant against the stupidity of the working class, lol.  &gt; How is it determined that it has social value?  If someone actually wants it and is willing to ""buy"" it for the amount of labor embedded in it, it has social value.  &gt;  (and what happens when people disagree?).  They just don't buy it. That's it.  &gt; How is it determined that it is of a fit quantity and quality?  The consumers can do that, refusing to buy from a commune until their commodities are fixed, or if they are very irregular in their activities they can ""hire"" a quality control commune to oversee (but not directly affect) their activities.  &gt; (and what happens when people disagree?)  Again, nothing, it's not their business and they're not the ones using it.",™

And, by the way, it's going to have to be the left to fix this problem because you know the right never ever will. Ever.   Aug 16, 10:57 AM EDT  STUDY: COMPANIES PAID MORE TO CEOS THAN IN US TAX  BY BERNARD CONDON  AP BUSINESS WRITER   AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta BUSINESS VIDEO  BUY AP PHOTO REPRINTS  INTERACTIVE 	CAPTAINS OF INDUSTRY: COMPARING CEO PAY AND PERFORMANCE  NEW YORK (AP) -- Twenty-six big U.S. companies paid their CEOs more last year than they paid the federal government in tax, according to a study released Thursday by a liberal-leaning think tank.  The study, by the Institute for Policy Studies, said the companies, including AT&amp;T, Boeing and Citigroup, paid their CEOs an average of $20.4 million last year while paying little or no federal tax on ample profits, according to regulatory filings.  Some companies cited in the study said it was misleading. They also said they took advantage of tax deductions and credits designed to free up money for companies to spend in ways that stimulate the economy.  On average, the 26 companies generated pretax net income of more than $1 billion in the U.S., the study said.  The study blasted tax rules allowing unlimited deductions for CEO ""performance-based"" pay, like many stock options. It said the five biggest performance payers among the 26 companies took $232 million of these deductions last year.  Among the ""kingpins"" it criticized was CEO James McNerney Jr. of Boeing. It said he got $18.4 million in pay last year while his company received a tax refund of $605 million.  The study also laid into Citigroup for paying CEO Vikram Pandit $14.9 million while the bank received a net $144 million in tax benefits.  Eighteen of the 26 companies received cash back or credits to apply against tax in the future, according to the report.  The study, a 45-page attack on the corporate tax code, said deductions and credits are allowing companies to lavish big pay packages on executives so they can cut their tax bills while Washington gets less money in a time of trillion-plus deficits.  ""Our nation's tax code has become a powerful enabler of bloated CEO pay,"" the study said.  To calculate tax, the study used companies' own math based on accounting rules. Regulators require companies to estimate their tax bill and disclose it in public documents for investors.  The tax filings the companies make to the government, typically in September, are private and can differ from the estimate.  Another problem is that the study doesn't count tax the company plans to pay but has deferred to future years. The authors argue that deferred tax can be put off indefinitely.  Charles Bickers, a Boeing spokesman, said that the company's federal tax bill, including deferred tax, was $1.3 billion last year, not a net credit, as the think tank's study found.  Boeing did lower its tax, in part by using a popular tax credit encouraging companies to spend more on research and development. Bickers said that helped the company hire 11,000 people in the U.S. last year.  ""Boeing supports a simpler, more competitive tax code. At the same time, we have put the R&amp;D tax credit to exactly the use it was designed - creating U.S. jobs in a high-value, advanced technology industry,"" he said in a statement.  The Institute for Policy Studies said Boeing would have spent the money on R&amp;D without the credit.  In addition to performance-pay deductions and R&amp;D credits, the report criticized the use of tax havens that allow technology companies, for instance, to assign intellectual-property rights to shell companies in the Cayman Islands, so they can run profits through them and avoid taxes. It noted that 26 companies have a combined 537 subsidiaries in tax-haven countries.  The study also cited accelerated depreciation on investments, which allows a company to take deductions for big-ticket purchases in one year, as opposed to over several years. That cuts taxes in the first year.  The study said AT&amp;T used accelerated depreciation to save $5.2 billion on its 2011 taxes while paying CEO Randall Stephenson $18.7 million last year.  Sarah Lubman, an AT&amp;T spokeswoman, said the point of accelerated depreciation is to encourage companies to make investments. She said AT&amp;T made $20 billion in investments last year, helping to ""drive the economy and support good-paying jobs.""  She also said that the deductions won't be available to take in future years, which should increase taxes.  A Citigroup spokeswoman noted that the company lost money in 2008 and 2009 and used the losses to offset taxes on profits this year.  © 2012 THE ASSOCIATED PRESS. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

I injured my knee a little, which meant that I skip all the prayers ""because sitting down is really really painful"" (cue sad, exasperated face).  I haven't been to a single one except last week where I insisted that I could bear the pain for The Almighty.

t5_2sfmf,bitbutter,1345225913,"&gt; It's The State's Fault And Not The Natural Cause Of Laissez-Faire Capitalism™  Correct.  &gt; Sure, because creating a free capitalist market would single-handedly dismantle the monopoly Monsanto has on agriculture, the oligopoly Microsoft and Apple have on computer OS's, etc.  Correct. These firms rely very heavily on the state in it's enforcement of intellectual property law. Law that would be unthinkable on a freed market.  &gt; ""a company is already established in that market and it will do hell if you try to squeeze in there with it"".  How can it 'do hell'? Only with the help of the state. It's the same pattern always.  &gt; Workers are much, much less likely to ""band together"" and create their own co-op, because if their business fails, they will have lost everything   Why do they not start with smaller ventures then? Ones the wouldn't completely wipe them out if they failed? I think you know the answer really: They prefer to not even take a smaller risk. They'd prefer to work for the capitalists and have their wages forwarded whether or not the venture is ultimately successful, and so they're better off (at least in their own estimation) because the capitalists exist.  &gt; Also, you still haven't defined the ""risks"" that the capitalists take which would still be present in a workers' economy.  I don't know what you mean by a 'workers economy'. If you mean communism, this wouldn't exist for long to start with, the economy would collapse thanks to the impossibility of economic calculation under socialism.  &gt; Worsened simply by the existence of the capitalist.  The situation of the worker is made worse by the capitalist who offers them work, and whose investment brings into existence the means of production that would otherwise not exist? You haven't explained why this is the case. Frankly it sounds absurd.  &gt; that factory builders still need to build factories and workers still need to work inside factories.   People's role in life aren't static, but pretending that they are for a second: Yes, but they won't do this work for free. The capitalist will pay them to do it, while this option would not otherwise have existed. Again, the capitalist has helped.  &gt; we do live in a plutocratic world where only the rich can get richer,   No we don't, please don't exaggerate. Even under statism, which does artificially benefit the already wealthy, we still have thousands of examples of people from poor backgrounds becoming wealthy.  &gt; Give me an explanation as to how economic crises and the boom/bust cycle occur. Just curious.  It's too big a subject to go into here. but if you'd like to see a primer, you could start here: http://mises.org/daily/672  &gt; so owing due to gamblers' nature of capitalism only the rich are able to comfortably invest in private property.  It certainly takes wealth to begin. But (at least on a freed market, probably not under statism--granted) workers could pool resources and become capitalists, starting small (small enough that they wouldn't starve if it failed). What's stopping them seems to be a preference to take employment rather than take entrepreneurial risk, a perfectly understandable preference--and not 'stupid' at all.  &gt;&gt;&gt; One ""labor-hour"" is akin to one hour spent working on a product that has social value and is fit of quantity and quality,  &gt;&gt; How is it determined that it has social value?   &gt; If someone actually wants it and is willing to ""buy"" it for the amount of labor embedded in it, it has social value.  Okay. The 'amount of labour embedded in a thing' you're talking about cannot be the number of concrete hours it took to make it, since this would mean that the 'fair price' for the pies baked by a baker who was half as fast as his neighbour, wold be twice as much as his neighbours pies (which were otherwise identical, as far as customers were concerned).   So communist advocates of the labour theory of value need to posit the idea of abstract 'socially necessary labour', which probably _doesn't_ correspond to the actual amount of hours taken to make a thing. But to the number of hypothetical hours it would take for a 'competent' (however that's decided) person to make _a thing that people want_.  Here's the rub: to try to figure out how much 'socially necessary labour' is embodied in a thing, we have to look at how much people want it. _but this has no necessary connection to labour hours at all_! The hole 'hours' thing is utterly redundant.   The solution is to appreciate that the labour theory of value has been debunked more than a century ago, and that the subjective theory of value is a _much_ better fit with reality. If you look into it I think you'll get it. And it aligns perfectly with your market-like scenario of communes using prices (incidentally, this option is perfectly compatible with my preferred social order).",™
t5_2qh1i,AmpleWarning,1345225963,"A lot of good points have been mentioned already.  The main point of consideration for me is the nature of the announcement.  If we're talking about a scientifically-based, peer-reviewed, empirically verified study that says the world is going to implode, then we have several hurdles to overcome.  In truth, no matter how solid the evidence is, there will be mass numbers of people who will automatically discredit that evidence simply because it doesn't mesh with their world view.  So a large portion of the populace is probably just going to go heavily into denial mode.  This will probably continue right up until the actual moment of implosion.  Then you have the opposite end of the spectrum, where people have been waiting for something *exactly like this* to happen because it DOES mesh with their world view.  Doesn't matter if it's 150 years or 150 hours...these people will finally have their time in the limelight.  Millions of people will flock to these prophets and doomsayers.  For the first few years, the news will be an insufferable mess of wailing and prognosticating over the impending END TIMEZ™.  Then things will probably cool off, as people get used to the new concept of a world with a definable shelf life.  Even when we're talking about the end of the world, everyone will eventually get tired of endless reposts.  Of course, as time advances, more and more people with questionable morals will take advantage of the situation to further their own ends.  Insurance policies, protective amulets, reinforced storm cellars...anything that could possibly placate an increasingly worried populace will be on sale, and commanding increasing revenue as time goes by.  Then, as the final years pass, any natural disaster that occurs will automatically be seen as a sign of the Apocalypse.  The fires of fear will start to flare up, and the grandchildren of the original doomsayers will be the ones pushing the bellows.  Things that would normally be passed off as ""business as usual"" will rattle the populace and whip them into a frenzy.  Wars will start over minor offenses, and the value of life in general will drop significantly.  Then by the time the actual event occurs, it will destroy the last vestiges of a humanity that was already 75% in the grave.  But I'll be dead by then so lol Gotterdammurung.",™

However, it doesn't say anything about any other kind of fish, except this section:  ""Why are GloFish® the only fluorescent fish that can be sold in the United States? Because fluorescent fish are unique, their sale is covered by a substantial number of patents and pending patent applications. The providers of GloFish® fluorescent fish, 5-D Tropical and Segrest Farms, are the only distributors that have the necessary licenses to produce and market fluorescent fish within the United States. The production of fluorescent fish by any other party, or the sale of any fluorescent fish not originally distributed by 5-D Tropical or Segrest Farms, is strictly prohibited. For additional information regarding GloFish® fluorescent fish license details please click here.""  I went through all their pictures also. The only ones displaying the colored Black Skirt Tetras showed them *entirely green.* Not just a solid stripe down the fishes back. Plus, why are these fish (the tetras is all I'm referring to, not the actual Glo-Fish themselves.) sold as Mixed Fruit Tetras then instead of Glo-Fish Tetras? Which still leads me to believe that *this particular fish* is still an artificially dyed version. To include the ones I own. I HAVE some of these fish! I know what they look like. :)  The entire site is actually really interesting, and I'm glad you linked it. But I'm still going to say that these are dyed, as they don't look similar enough to the ones manufactured by Glo-Fish to be genetic. Or if my fish spawn, I guess their babies will actually tell me what's what.

t5_2snuc,lanemik,1345232833,"&gt;Don't tell the particle physicists! They need to keep their funding!  Particle physics has nothing to say about this because none of them posit a universe (or particles) that is actually without cause. All quantum mechanics is contingent upon the existence of the relativistic quantum field which itself is contingent (upon what nobody knows).  &gt;Our best model of the universe so far, drawing on quantum mechanics, indicates that reality is probabilistic.  And yet, still contingent and these probabilities are grounded upon physical stuff. Honestly, the more I see it done the more I think that appealing to QM is the new god of the gaps. Quantum uncertainty of the gaps. ""Do you have a problem with a stupid philosopher poking holes in your naturalism? Just use Quantum Spackle®!""  &gt; Things can happen not because they were caused to happen, or because they necessarily happened, but because they could happen.  They can only happen because of a cause, the relativistic quantum field which itself is contingent. As David Albert (Ph.D. in theoretical physics) puts it:   &gt;The fact that some arrangements of fields happen to correspond to the existence of particles and some don’t is not a whit more mysterious than the fact that some of the possible arrangements of my fingers happen to correspond to the existence of a fist and some don’t. And the fact that particles can pop in and out of existence, over time, as those fields rearrange themselves, is not a whit more mysterious than the fact that fists can pop in and out of existence, over time, as my fingers rearrange themselves. And none of these poppings — if you look at them aright — amount to anything even remotely in the neighborhood of a creation from nothing.  ...  &gt;Now, I can't blame Kant for not knowing quantum mechanics in the 1700s. But what we've observed wins. The things that we observe on a day-to-day basis, the objects and events at our middle-world scale, are indeed either caused by something or necessary. But that's not the only scale there is in the universe.  Can I blame *you* for not knowing QM? How about philosophy?",®

t5_2qmiy,wobblebonk,1345233014,"So... maybe some people won't like my answer.  I suspect you got a cheap 10m HDMI cable no?    &gt;720p/1080i Resolution - The Standard HDMI® Cable has sufficient bandwidth to transfer 720p/1080i video signals between 720p/1080i rated source and sink (display) devices.  Note that this tends to indicate that it MIGHT work with 1080p. If you're outputting 120hz that's even more data than 1080p. HDMI data is uncompressed and frankly with a cheap cable the high frequency performance is going to suffer. Do I need to explain that sending 1920 × 1080 at 120 fps is going to inherently be a pretty high frequency operation that will suffer with long cables?  The easiest thing to do to test if the cable is just not cutting it is to move your computer near the receiver and use a much shorter cable and see if you experience the same behavior or if it works properly. If so I would look into getting a cable certified for high speed hdmi certification at that length. They have some on mono-price... if it still doesn't work I am opposed to recommending some super expensive hdmi cables ;/  Is this really an audiophile question? ;/ whatever.  Perhaps a squeezebox could be used to have wireless sound from your pc with that setup relatively cheaply, but ""without losing audio quality"" is a tricky one here, depending on your beliefs and how important certain measurements are to you.",®

t5_2qore,BishopAndWarlord,1345235798,"True, Blizzard ""soon"" is between now and sun-death, but they didn't say soon for the patch day.

t5_2qh2p,zongxr,1345235994,"&gt; Are you seriously suggesting that government is behind some of our greatest achievements and not individuals?   NO I'm NOT... you should work the Romney campaign... it's the same twisting of Obama line on business. Are you suggesting to me that without the governing structure our modern society would have emerged? Without the protection and investments made by it? Are you suggesting that NASA would have naturally developed? And why is it all of sudden accomplishments are made by individuals but Government isn't about bad politicians vs good politicians, or bad policy vs good policy, instead Government is some kind of generic catch all boogyman? You individualize when convenient and then group together when your demonizing.   &gt; I think you are reaching for reasons to condemn me for living in a society I have no real choice but to live.  What you mean by real? You mean no convenient alternative... society gives to benefits.... you take advantage of them at the same time looking to place your cost on to the rest of us.. and then make excuses for it.   It's the fundamental flaw in your ideology that you haven't taken the time to consider because your emotionally attached to it because of your general dissatisfaction with it's performance as of recent.   &gt; because all you're doing is trying to excuse the arrogance the State   See how emotionally attached you are you ideology.. You see Government as an entity... it's not it's a SYSTEM.. it's an idea.. it's mostly intangible. Removing it's physical manifestation doesn't solve your freedom™ issue. A governing structure will remanifest in one way or another, and always has. Take Uganda the libertarian ""Paradise"", a weak and nearly non-existence centralized government has given rise to the warlord and the pirate who have their own governing structure, typically much simpler than what we find in the more traditional governments.  &gt; ""We built this for you, therefore you owe us,"" is not a reason to steal from people  What do you MEAN we built this for you, screw you we built this for US... and YOUR trying to take it for FREE... WE PAID for it, you are not part of WE or US, and taking from US is stealing. Your just washing your hands of responsibility because it's convenient and in your best interest to do so.   Also if you can use your reasoning you would know humans can BOTH be function as part society AND as an individual. Your not ANY more individual than me so you can get off your high horse in that respect.   But you don't care and so why should I? I've already been labeled destructive and a Statist. I've already been disregarded even though you have yet to challenge the core principal behind my argument. And thats just fine, I'm not about the challenge the Pope on the existence of Jesus, so why would challenges the central tenants of an extremist ideology be any different.  I'll take the last word... but you never really countered any of my arguments... so it's really just 1 more word in a long line of words that you ignored. ",™

But basically, in order to keep costs down a lot of pre-built computers are manufactures using motherboards that are compatible with only one type of RAM or CPU or whatnot; therefore, upgrading to the next generation becomes near impossible.  Looking online, I found [this specification list.](http://support.gateway.com/emachines/desktop/2011/emachines/el/EL1358G/EL1358Gsp2.shtml) Notice in the processor section it lists ""AMD Phenom™ II X3 triple-core processor."" That's the best possible processor you could upgrade your computer to, given the specifications of your computer's motherboard. The issue is that this processor is ~$150 to buy. That leaves you with $100.  I noticed in another post that you mentioned you had a GeForce 430 (?); I don't know exactly what settings you want to play your games at, but if you're looking for maxed out settings the graphics card alone will set you back around ~$250.  Bearing all that in mind, I'll recommend these actions:  1) Check out the BaPC Beginner's Guide (on the sidebar). Read through it and make sure you understand a) why you want a gaming computer, b) what you want out of this computer, and c) what all the parts of the computer do.  2) Be prepared to set aside some time for the next week (not a lot. Like 30 mins a day on average, if that) and just surf through various threads in this forum. Read. Absorb. Post questions in other people's threads if you have them (i.e why this part, why that choice, etc.).  3) When that period is over, come back and do some independent research and sort out a) if you want to upgrade or overhaul, b) what you are willing to spend, and c) what kind of gaming experience you're looking for.  4) When that's done, start looking at parts. pcpartpicker.com is REALLY handy. Look at builds done at a similar budget.   5) Post a Build Ready thread. People will critique, they may even tear it apart. But it's helpful.  6) Order some parts based on the advice. Put it all together.   7) Have a shitton of fun for the next few years on your new (or upgraded) gaming machine.",™

Show him:  *** g 12/10 pp. 22-23 How Can I Explain the Bible’s View of Homosexuality? *** If someone asks: “What’s your view of homosexuality?” You might reply: “I don’t hate homosexuals, but I can’t approve of their conduct.”  ✔ Remember: If you’re guided by the Bible’s moral code, then that is your lifestyle choice, and you have a right to it. (Joshua 24:15) Don’t feel ashamed of your view.—Psalm 119:46. Shouldn’t Christians treat all people with respect, regardless of their sexual orientation? Absolutely. The Bible says: “Honor men of all sorts” or, as Today’s English Version renders it, “Respect everyone.” (1 Peter 2:17) Therefore, Christians are not homophobic. They show kindness to all people, including those who are gay.—Matthew 7:12. If someone asks: “Doesn’t your view of homosexuality encourage prejudice against gays?” You might reply: “Not at all. I reject homosexual conduct, not people.”  ✔ You could add: “To illustrate it, I also choose not to smoke. In fact, I find the very idea of it repugnant. But suppose you’re a smoker and you feel differently. I wouldn’t be prejudiced against you for your view, just as I’m sure you wouldn’t be prejudiced against me for my view—am I right? The same principle applies to our differing views of homosexuality.”  It's good that the WTS has at least changed their view on this a bit.  Tell him he she accept the WTS' new light on this matter instead of relying on his own prejudices. =)",✔

It's not NIV is evil or opposite, but simplified so much as to obscure (from my view, at least) some important shades of meaning. Here's an example I ran into yesterday:  King James Bible (Cambridge Ed.) For he performeth the thing that is appointed for me: and many such things are with him.  Young's Literal Translation For He doth complete my portion, And many such things are with Him.  New International Version (©1984) He carries out his decree against me, and many such plans he still has in store.  (note that NASB, ESV, etc. are all similar to KJV. NLT is different. But ""carries out his decree against me?"" here's a link with a bunch of translations if you're curious: http://bible.cc/job/23-14.htm)  Here's another one that irks me: ""no variableness nor shadow of turning"" (KJV, etc.) vs. ""does not change like shifting shadows"" (NIV). (http://bible.cc/james/1-17.htm)  These aren't the only, nor the best examples, just recent ones. Does my shades of meaning point make sense? I don't mean that you can't grow by reading NIV (my first Bible was NIV: my main Scripture source for ~4 yrs) or that I would not respect an NIV-reader or anything, just that i don't read it myself and wouldn't recommend it if someone were shopping.

Racism is so 1968.**  **[✔]ad hominem – question a commenter’s intelligence, character, age or motives.**  **[✔]Whites are individuals – so you cannot make general statements about whites. Besides, that would be racist.**  **[✔]“Blacks are racist too” - but they do not like to admit it. Find a case where a black person did something just as bad as what they are pointing out.**  **[✔]“You are the racist one” - turn the tables.**  **[✔]“I am offended” – how dare they call you a racist! You do not see a person’s colour – they could be purple for all you care!**  **[✔]Arab trader argument – whites are not as evil as black people like to think. For example, it was not just white people who traded slaves: Arabs did it too! Few blacks know that, so make sure to point that out whenever you can.**  **[✔]“But that happened to me too!” – whatever blacks complain about, try to find a case where a white person – you, a friend, someone in the news -  experienced the same thing.**  **[✔]Point out how “ghetto” and disagreeable black people are – because they are and it needs pointing out. No wonder no one gets along with them!**  **[✔]Talk down to them – they are imagining things, they do not know what they are talking about. How dare blacks tell us what we are like. What do they know? Are they white?**  **[✔]straw man – argue against some stock position that is kind of like the post. That way you can copy your comments from another blog. Or from Ann Coulter.**  **[✔]Blacks need to be colour-blind – if they just stopped seeing race and talking about it so much then racism would go away!**  **[✔]Start quoting rape statistics – out of the blue, if necessary. Rates of imprisonment are good too.**  **[✔]The white inventor argument – whites invented everything so shut up already.**  **[✔]Demand proof – Make them prove it beyond a reasonable doubt with facts and figures. Find holes in whatever facts they present. Find counter-facts.**  **[✔]Make it about the past - and point out that your family never owned slaves. When are they going to stop living in the past?**  **[✔]Go back to Africa – if it is so bad here, then go back to Africa already!**  **[✔]Bootstrap – I made it on my own without help from anyone.

t5_2qhh7,rmc,1345326308,"Yes I have to agree here. Ireland is not as bad as you appear to make out.  There are several things to remember about Ireland &amp; modern Irish people, especially if you're in the USA and are aware of Irish-Americans.   * Irish-Americans (AFAIK) are quite old fashioned, and more staunchly catholic, and anti-LGBT, than Irish people. Some of the rules for the New York Paddy's Day parade are cringeworthy to Irish people (""England out of Ireland""?!?! WTF? Here we have local migrant groups marching in our Paddy's Day parades)  * Ireland has changed a lot in a generation. Literally. There has been a massive social change in the last 20 → 30 years. So yes there was a referendum to legalise divorce in Ireland, in 1996, and it passed by ~ 50.3%. However now that issue would not be controversial at all. A Taoiseach (like Prime Minister), Bertie Ahern, was separated from his wife and lived with his long time partner. No-one complained about his family values.  * Lots of people in Ireland are ""ethnically Catholic"", and will mark ""Catholic"" on the census forms. This is because for a while ""Catholic = Irish, not-catholic = english"". There were recent survies of Catholics in Ireland (not just Irish people, Catholic Irish people), and the majority (~60+% do not agree with the Church on sexuality).  * Yes abortion is illegal in Ireland, however the UK, where abortion is legal, is a 1 hour plane journey away. This ""half solution"" is good enough for most people to not want to shake things up too much. It is explicitly legal to travel abroad for an abortion and to hear about getting an abortion abroad, no censorship nor ""police at the border"" situation here. Abortion is probably easier to get in Ireland than some parts of USA.  Some examples of Ireland being progressive w.r.t. LGBT equality (rather than anecdotes):   * Last Irish presidential election (last year), we had an only gay, and long time LGBT activist (David Norris), run for president. He (along with 2 previous presidents) is responsible for legalising homosexuality here. He got ~ 6.2% of the first preference votes (☹).  * Of the 7 presidential candidates, only 2 were not in favour of marriage equality, and they got a combined total of only 5.6% of the votes. That means 94% of the population voted for canidates who supported marriage equality.  * Here's a video of the now president (then TD (like congressperson)) calling for marriage equality, 5 years ago. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9cSSH6imyM  * There are sevaral openly LGB people in the parliament.  * It is illegal in Ireland to discriminate based on sexual orientation, or gender identity. A trans person was fired from their job for wanting to transition, and successfully sued them. The government is introducing laws to allow trans people to change their birth certs (but it dragging their heels).  Ireland isn't perfect, but it is incorrect to say ""Ireland is the US, but 50 years back in the past"". Ireland is a modern, liberal country. ",☹

t5_2rlnw,ForeverAFeminist,1345330398,"&gt;What you posted is, instead, a reason that a man would want to post in SRSwomen.  Except that /r/SRSMen is NOT a place merely for men. It's a place for pro-feminist men, who are in fact a minority on this website. Meanwhile, feminist women are a minority within a minority. Hence why /r/SRSWomen needs to have a policy of banning men in order for women to speak without getting drowned out by men. It's a safe space for women.  &gt;So your argument is that SRSMen is about men's issues, and that's all the discussion a man would need?   Men are free to contribute at /r/SRSDiscussion and /r/SRSFeminism.  &gt;If men have on place for discussing women's issues, why would women need places for discussing men's issues?  Men AND women are welcome at /r/SRSMen. Ideally, we would have a userbase at /r/SRSMen that is 45% male 45% female 10% different identity, but we don't. Instead, as expected on a website dominated by men, we have it skew towards men being the dominant voice. In order to **compensate** for this skewing, we allow women to comment in /r/SRSMen, and we don't let men comment in /r/SRSWomen.  It's a basic matrix as far as how welcome the different genders are presented in each subreddit:   | | | | :--|:--|:-- &amp;nbsp; | Women | Men SRSWomen | ✔ | **X** SRSMen | ✔ | ✔  This is to compensate for the rest of Reddit, which basically looks like this:  | | | | :--|:--|:-- &amp;nbsp; | Women | Men All | **X** | ✔ [2xc](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes) | ✔ | ✔  Your username identifies you as a feminist, so do you also support affirmative action, or no?

t5_2qhh7,rmc,1345376386,"OK, let's all just cool our jets a minute. I think there are lots of things that we all need to take into account about ""Ireland"" and ""Irish-Americans"" and common American attitudes about Ireland.   * Irish people often come into contact with Americans who seem to think we're in the mediæval age (e.g. recent post on r/ireland of a college student who thinks that everyone speaks Irish ('Gaelic') and St. Paddy's Day is a very religious holiday http://www.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/y4owo/ill_be_studying_in_your_beautiful_country/ ). Yes we have electricity and washing machines and stuff here as well. Irish people, when talking to Americans can get a bit sick of trying to fight the stereotype that we're all backwards.  * There is a massive asymmetry in information. Irish people are going to be aware of Ireland and probably USA. However lots of people in USA will not know anything about Ireland today.  * Politically aware Irish people, esp. LGBT people, will be aware of what's going on in the USA, esp. with LGBT rights. We see high level politicians invoking God and talking about their Christian Faith, things we never see here in Ireland. We see high level politicians in USA actively fighting LGBT rights. Here we see the Civil Partnership Bill (which is like marriage but no rights to children) pass without an opposition vote in the Dáil (lower house of parliament) and 90% in favour in the Seanad (upper house). (Looks like the elected politicans had no problem ""wrapping their head around it"").  Hence we Irish people see someone (who I presume is from the Americas) talk about how Ireland is like the USA but ""wind the clock back 50 years"" on LGBT issues, we just know that person didn't do the basics of research, and it makes one go ""Hang on a minute!"".  I know there's a lot of America bashing, which is unfair and inaccurate, so don't take this as a ""nyanya amerikkka sux"" way.  Imagine someone said ""It's amazing Obama got elected, because in lots of states in the USA, black people cannot vote and have to sit in a different part of the bus!"". That would show someone Just Doesn't Know What They Are Talking About™. That's what it feels like when an American something like ""Ireland is deeply Catholic"".  Also, this is a Northern Ireland *Unionist* politician. They would never call themselves Irish, and lots of Irish people would not call them Irish either. It is totally wrong to think they speak for Ireland. It would be like quoting a Mexican politician as what the USA thinks!",™

t5_2qpp6,SadCritters,1345420754,"...They WERE doing this well.  And you're a complete moron for trying to argue that in THIS thread specifically---Where the OP admitted they counted ALL THE ZvZ'S as wins.  Zergs were doing well way before the patch. You should probably go look at some of the scales from before it. ( Which entirely support what I am saying. )  The Ghost nerf is when Terrans started losing to Zergs. ( Because Terrans were no longer able to rely on Snipe to kill every Zerg unit. )  The only thing I am angry about is how stupid you are---Which is very frustrating because you feel that your opinion is a considered ""Fact"" versus what has actually happened.   I already pointed out that you're using logical fallacies to try and get your point across. I already pointed out when Zergs started winning most of their games versus Terran.  All you keep doing is restating your argument of ""Herpderp Queens and Overlords. Herpderp that patch made Zergs win."" as though someone's going to actually accept your opinion versus facts; when in fact Terrans are still reeling from the previous patch---Not the one you are pointing out.  You're arguing actual facts with your opinion.   I'd probably go back to school, if I were you.  You also entirely dodged the fact that I pointed out the Infestor Nerf. Zergs were still winning after that nerf---According to your horri-bad logic, that means that the nerf actually made Zergs STRONGER because Zerg win-rates continued to climb.

t5_2qhff,viborg,1345435248,"I don't know if the mechanism is fully understood, but it does seem the effectiveness of the herb I had in mind, Astragalus or Huang Qi, has not been fully demonstrated. Here's some info from [Wikipedia:](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astragalus#Research)  &gt;Research  &gt;The biotechnology firms Geron Corporation and TA Therapeutics of Hong Kong have been working on deriving a telomerase activator from it. The chemical constituent cycloastragenol (also called TAT2) is being studied to help combat HIV, as well as infections associated with chronic diseases or aging. However, the National Institutes of Health states: ""The evidence for using astragalus for any health condition is limited. High-quality clinical trials (studies in people) are generally lacking. There is some preliminary evidence to suggest that astragalus, either alone or in combination with other herbs, may have potential benefits for the immune system, heart, and liver, and as an adjunctive therapy for cancer"".  &gt;A study published in the 15 November 2008 Journal of Immunology, researchers shed light on the antiviral and antiaging benefits of Astragalus. In their paper, a team of researchers from the UCLA AIDS Institute described how their work with cycloastragenol reduces the aging process of immune cells, and enhances how these cells respond to viral infections. The compound works by boosting production of telomerase, an enzyme that allows for the replacement of short bits of DNA, known as telomeres, that play a key role in cell replication, cancer and human aging.  [More evidence in favor:](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pat.357/abstract)   &gt;Abstract   Sulfated astragalus polysaccharide (sulfated astragalan, SA) was prepared by chemical modification of astragalus polysaccharide abstracted from an astragalus menbranceus used as a Mongolia herbal medicine. Anti-HIV activity of SA was assayed in vitro and the results indicated that the SA showing high anti-HIV activity and lower cytotoxity. Sulfation of astragalan was carried out by using sulfur trioxide-pyridine complex in a mixture of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) to give sulfated astragalan with degree of substitution (DS) of 1.14–1.20 and a number average molecular weight (Mn) of 1.27–1.46 × 104. Copyright © 2003 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.  [And most recently](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22083896) (although this is published in Planta Medica, I don't know what kind of journal it is):  &gt;Abstract   Two Chinese herb-derived small molecule telomerase activators, astragaloside IV (AG-IV) and cycloastragenol (CAG), have recently been shown to improve the proliferative response of CD8+ T lymphocytes from HIV-infected patients by upregulating telomerase activity. Here, we examined the signaling mechanism of AG-IV and CAG. Telomerase activity in human embryonic kidney HEK293 fibroblasts was increased upon treatment with increasing concentrations of AG-IV or CAG. Both compounds induced the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) in a time- and dose-dependent manner in HEK293 cells and HEK-neo keratinocytes. AG-IV and CAG also stimulated ERK phosphorylation in other cell lines of lung, brain, mammary, endothelial, and hematopoietic origins. Use of selective inhibitors and dominant negative mutants revealed the involvement of c-Src, MEK (ERK kinase), and epidermal growth factor receptor in CAG-induced ERK phosphorylation. Our data indicate that AG-IV and CAG may exert their cellular effects through the activation of the Src/MEK/ERK pathway.",©

t5_2qh61,SavageHenry0311,1345444088,"If anyone's interested in what Pilar means, here's a little medicolegal word-vomit.  There are three types of consent in medicine:  Expressed consent - The patient states, either verbally or in writing that it's okay to do something.  I say,""The doc thinks you'll feel better after some IV fluids.  To do that, I need to poke you in the arm with this huge rusty needle.  You ready for some pain, bud?""  When the patient says,""Do your worst, Henry.  You're a fucking punk and you're gonna miss the first three sticks anyway.  Might as well get this line started while we're both still young,"" that's expressed consent.  Informed consent - The patient has a clear understanding of the act, it's intents, consequences, and ramifications.  This is usually done in writing.  When you go in for a scheduled surgery, for example, you sign a whole bunch of paperwork stating what you're getting done, what could go wrong, that it might not work, etc.    I use informed consent a lot as an EMS type.  It's actually illegal for me to take a person who is of sound mind to the hospital against their will.  If that person refuses transport, I'm supposed to get them to sign a form that says basically ""If you don't go with ol' Henry here, you might die.  That's not his fault.""  Note the ""of sound mind"" part.  I transport people against their will all the time.  Once, I took this dude from an Occupy Wall Street demonstration.  He'd been huffing computer cleaner all day, and had two empty Xanax bottles that had been filled within a few days.  He was stumbling, had apparently urinated on himself, and was not oriented to time, date, location, or events.  The whole way to the ED he lectured me in semi-coherent, slurring words about how I was a corporate shill profiting from denying working people their basic human rights.  The words ""You'll be hearing from my attorney,"" and ""you fucking scumbag kidnapping corporate thug"" were mentioned.  I'm not a kidnapper (the rest is open to interpretation) because it was impossible for him to give informed consent to a refusal of treatment/transport.  He was gorked out of his mind.  Which leads us to....   Implied consent - The patient implies consent by their actions.  If you show up to your doc's office for another yearly physical, it's understood that you aren't going to hire a lawyer to go after the nurse that took your blood pressure because she put a BP cuff around your arm.  You knew that would happen, and you showed up anyway...  If you've just had a grotesque and improbable blender accident, and cannot sign legal forms due to the blood spurting from the stumps where your hands used to be, that's okay.  A reasonable person in their right mind would want some help.  The hairy palm floating in your smoothie and the arterial blood arcing through the air are a hint to me, your friendly ambalamps driver, that you want to go to the ED.  Just because the answer to every question I ask is ""Fuck the Vita-Mix Automatic Mix'n Machine® and all five pre-programmed settings,"" doesn't mean you're going to die.  ",®

t5_2qh6c,jasongardin,1345458722,"&gt;I feel I can no longer claim to be apart of the ""Christian"" faith...that focuses on accepting Christ so that I may go to heaven  Yes! Yes! Yes! This is fabulous news, because the Christian Gospel is so much bigger that just 'hey say this prayer and accept these doctrines and you'll go to Happy Place™ when you die!'  &gt;How is it even possible to know all of that while living a human experience? To understand what ""God"" is? I always found the most meaningful parts of Christ's message to be that of doing your best in living a full life, loving, caring, forgiving, etc..and they often seem to be ignored.  The thing about Christianity is that it basic and essential doctrine is that what it means to be God and what it means to be human are jumbled up together, and in at least some real sense, mean the same thing. We call this the Incarnation and it's what we mean when we say that Jesus is both fully divine and fully human. Part of what it's like to be God is to be human.  So Jesus teaches us lots of things, about compassion and peace and justice and even, gasp, *holiness.* And what's going on here is that Jesus says that these teachings open us up to life as we can most fully live it. Jesus' teachings show us what God is really like, yes. But importantly, they also show us what being human is really like.  The Christian Gospel has many implications, but one of them is that God is trying to make me human again. By necessity, being a human being means I am connected to other people. I am not an island. My humanity is bound up with everyone else.   But I'm isolated. As far back as I can remember, I've been isolated. Some of it really isn't my fault, but if I'm honest, lots of it is. This is what we mean when we talk about 'sin.' Famous Christians like Augustine and Martin Luther have talked about sin as 'homo incurvatus in se,' that is, 'human beings turned in on themselves.'  We've become less human than we were meant to be. Jesus is, for us, fully human and so he shows us what being fully human means. Love your neighbor. Turn the other cheek. Be compassionate. And the real surprise is, when we start learning what it means to be fully human, we discover that these same things are actually what it means to be divine.  &gt;Do many Christians not ask these questions?  So, yes. Many *many* Christians ask these questions. If I'm honest, serious Christian faith doesn't start until you *do*. ",™

He, his party and any project he's associated with would be a target for heavy criticism, and his fellow party members would ""suggest"" stepping down from any current position simply because he could damage his party's election results at any level, from local to federal.  A relatively recent (early 2011) political scandal hit our defense minister Guttenberg. Apparently, he had plagiarized parts of his doctoral thesis. In the end, he more or less voluntarily stepped down from all of his political positions.  Somewhat more extreme was the case of Sarrazin, former politician and then member of the Bundesbank's board of executives. Having a history of controversial remarks regarding immigrants and poverty, he published the book ""Deutschland schafft sich ab"" (Germany abolishes itself), basically about the beautiful and intelligent *True Germans™* losing to the stupid and barbarian Muslim immigrants. This was a major scandal, and quickly lead to renewed calls for his resignation. He didn't leave voluntarily and I think even threatened to sue for wrongful termination or something, but in the end he was forced to resign.

Therefore, I put to you, that they don't care about tethering unless you use a lot of data, in which case they don't need to care about whether you are tethering or not because they can can limit you under the top 5% of users clause!",™

Linen is great for the heat, Brooks Brothers has some great Irish Linen short sleeve button downs in great colors, I un-button the collars and leave them that way.  John Nordstrom has some white, blue, and tan linen slacks, on sale for $50 right now, very nice and comfortable, but wrinkle easily.  They also have matching jackets on sale if you want a suit, but they are fully lined.  Varvatos makes a white linen jean that has a modern cut.    I avoid polo shirts, so I can not help there.  Fishing clothing is great for active wear and comes in may colors and price ranges, you simply will not find a cooler shirt or pants.  Simms, Orvis, Columbia, even Under Armor are making them.  They almost always have pockets, roll up sleeves, and vented backs.  The pants are often, but not always, zip offs and might have an extra pocket or two.  The best place to find a selection of this type of apparel is Bass Pro Shops and Cabelas, seriously, I just sent MFA there.    When it is time to be active and fashion no longer matters I stick to the fishing shirt and fishing/hiking/rock climbing pants.  A size over on the shirt (the shoulders will not look right), the right length sleeves, and correct length pants go a long way if you are on an expedition.  For example, here is my normal hot weather no one is around I am spending a week in a kayak in uninhabited islands and it is 110°F outside.  http://i.imgur.com/xWKJth.jpg If you are going to be in the sun a white long sleeve shirt and off white/tan pant are the best you can have.

Infuse the mash with near boiling water while stirring or with a recirculating mash system raise the temperature to mash out at 168°F (76°C). Sparge slowly with 170 °F (77 °C) water, collecting wort until the pre-boil kettle volume is around 5.9 gallons (22.3 L) and the gravity is 1.053 (13.2 °P).      The total wort boil time is 60 minutes. Add the first hop addition once the wort starts boiling. Add Irish moss or other kettle finings and the second hop addition with 15 minutes left in the boil. Add the last hop addition at flame out. Chill the wort to 67 °F (19 °C) and aerate thoroughly. The proper pitch rate is 2 packages of liquid yeast or 1 package of liquid yeast in a 2.4-liter starter.      Ferment at 67 °F (19 °C) until the yeast drops clear. At this temperature and with healthy yeast, fermentation should be complete in about one week. Allow the lees to settle and the brew to mature without pressure for another two days after fermentation appears finished. Rack to a keg and force carbonate or rack to a bottling bucket, add priming sugar, and bottle. Target a carbonation level of 2.5 volumes.",®

Then, surely this discovery does not render all our previous talk about water meaningless - it may have been false to say ""Water is composed of hydrogen and oxygen"", but we were nevertheless speaking the truth when we said ""The oceans are filled with water.""  Similarly, if we discover that we are in fact in a Matrix, then our beliefs about the world aren't suddenly revealed as false, because all the would show is that the *words* we were using have final referents different from what we had originally thought. It's still no less true that (say) ""The sun is shining"", since by ""sun"" we mean ""bright orb that illuminates the day"", and whether that thing is a ball of gas or a structure in a computer program, it makes no difference that could possibly affect our use of the word ""sun"".  Likewise, when you try to imagine what it would be like if we were in a Matrix, you think of things like ""vats of bodies"", ""computer programs"", etc.; but we have no choice but to conceive of such things *as they exist in our world*, since this world is our only source of knowledge. A notion such as a ""Really Real™ vat that my Real™ body is Really™ in right now"" is necessarily meaningless, since it is beyond the borders of our knowledge.  **TL;DR: It is incoherent to suppose that we're in a Matrix, since we only know the meaning of words by our knowledge of the world presented to us, and that includes the word ""Matrix"".**",™

Idiot at the front window goes up to the wrong car (this car was full of teenage girls), gives them a handful of treats, and says ""I hear there's some dogs in the car..."" They were not pleased.  During our downtime at the store, we would get some of the wilder girls to do some more adult themed dares. Luckily our manager was a 20 year old male, so he would allow it and encourage it. On one such occasion, a bunch of us were in the back breakroom daring two gals to get crazy.

t5_2qn9g,randonymous,1345580394,"'Modification' means little.  It just means the DNA has changed.  Nature modifies DNA all the time.  UV light modifies DNA.  What is often done in the agriculture industry is a gene is modified in vitro and when the optimal sequence is found it is recorded. But that is unnatural.  So then they irradiate a bunch of seeds until that same sequence is actually found in plants - via a 'natural' process.  A label that might be useful would be similar to an ingredients list - a gene list.  The following genes were inserted, knocked out or modified.  The genes already have names.  It would force consumers to learn about genes.  And it would actually be informative.  And at the moment there are not particularly many genes being modified/changed in these organisms.  This also allows consumers to guide the kinds of genes they would like to have.   Imagine a list:   **Known significant genetic modifications (either by in vivo or in vitro modification):**  *Genes inserted:*    * Vitamin B Synthase, Dextrin protease, HSP4835 (Confers frost resistance), Protexon™ (Roundup™ resistance)  *Genes Deleted:*   * Cyanide synthase, tubulin c (inhibits pollen synthesis)   With this list, someone could advertise ""Protexon Free!!"" the same way we do with ""No High Fructose Corn Syrup!"".  And it does so without fear-mongering the addition of vitamins and true health benefits added to grains that ultimately are the only way this world will be able to feed itself.   To ask for absolutely no modification will be akin to living without electricity - it might have some good goals at heart, but it objectively makes little sense.  Modern Amish even use a phone now and then.  There was great fear of electricity when the public knew nothing.  This is similar to the coming wave of biotechnology.  It would be silly to label something 'electric' vs ' not-electric'.  But it would be far more reasonable to say 'this device does not interfere with xxxxxxx, and runs on 110V AC current.  It has been deemed safe for use in the home so long as not used near water.'",™

Some good points for XML I had not considered due to my blind hatred:  * XML can represent objects and add values arbitrarily while preserving structure. * XML has properties.  So:      &lt;foo&gt;       &lt;bar&gt;Hello!&lt;/bar&gt;     &lt;/foo&gt;  This in JSON is like      { foo: { bar: ""Hello!"" } }  But      &lt;foo&gt;     &lt;bar&gt;Hello!&lt;/bar&gt;     &lt;bar&gt;World!&lt;/bar&gt;     &lt;/foo&gt;  requires a migration of the structure:      { foo: { bars: [""Hello!"",""World!""] } }  And now      &lt;foo&gt;     &lt;bar lang=""en""&gt;Hello!&lt;/bar&gt;     &lt;bar lang=""de""&gt;World!&lt;/bar&gt;     &lt;/foo&gt;  again drastically changes:      { foo: { bars: [{ lang: ""en"", content: ""Hello!""},{ lang: ""de"", content: ""World!"" }] } }  And you have to decide on a conventional name for the ""content"". Much to my in-built distrust of XML and the Enterprise™ culture surrounding it, it's an interesting point. If you're providing an API, every time you update with some small thing, in JSON it requires a different structure.  S-expressions can also do it:      (foo (bar ""hello!""))     (foo (bar ""hello!"") (bar ""world!""))     (foo (bar :lang ""en"" ""hello!"") (bar :lang ""de"" ""world!""))  Which is the nicest of all three in my opinion. Shorter than the JSON, less verbose than the XML. But s-expressions don't get any developer-love outside the Lisp communities.  **EDIT:** Before anyone else bothers with a mark-up vs serialization false dichotomy, remember that this isn't what my post is about. Look at s-expressions. That's not a mark-up format. But it has the good things about XML: namespacing, properties and arbitrary element adding. XML just happens to *additionally* be good for mark-up.",™

Obama was a naïve politician (I think) who had no clue that none of the shit he wanted to do would be possible or even beneficial (to him at least). He never pushed for draconian abortion laws, or any such Stone Age law.   As for the funding of Obamacare, that's all economics stuff that I can't be bothered to learn, because math is hard and I'd rather have someone else do it.

At least in terms of manpower, Obama has had the military all but withdraw entirely from Iraq, and moved a few thousand into Afghanistan. I'm not a pro-war person by any means, but I'm also not a big fan of ""it'd be really hard to do, let's not do it."" Since Obama was sworn in, the buildup of forces in Afghanistan (Happiest Place on Earth^® since 1990) has led to the deaths of Al-Qaeda's top 3 leaders. Ended the movement entirely, no. Crippled it, yes. It's no longer at the point where they can fling planes at us, but if we were to leave now, any progress made would be even more pointless. They're not Nazis, where killing the head causes the rest to shrivel and flake away. It's more like a Hydra.   I guess my point is ""devil I know.""

We've been doing it longest and we've got most pilots. Plus we're cheap too    We can raise your standings for any/all empire NPC corporations with agents in high sec, from Amarr Navy to Zainou.   Current Manager/Point of Contact for all matters : Imiarr Timshae   Our price list follows :      150mil for 0.00 to 1.00     200mil for 1.00 to 2.00 (350mil 0-2)     250mil for 2.00 to 3.00 (600mil 0-3)     300mil for 3.00 to 4.00 (900mil 0-4)     350mil for 4.00 to 5.00 (1250mil 0-5)     400mil for 5.00 to 6.00 (1600mil 0-6)     450mil for 6.00 to 7.00 (2100mil 0-7)     550mil for 7.00 to 8.00 (2620mil 0-8)     850mil for 8.00 to 9.00 (3470mil 0-9)     3000mil for 9.00 to 10.00 (6470mil 0-10)  Bear in mind - During this service the client will accumulate a considerable amount of LP (and a little ISK too). The LP (and ISK) is yours to keep - from 0 &gt; 6 is about 100k LP average.  FAQ :  Q Are the prices cumulative?  A No, for example 0 to 3.00 is a total of 600m (150 + 200 + 250).   Q How do you accept payment?  A I take payment in advance, in single stages or in multiples. Or for the whole job if you prefer. For example if I am starting to do 0 &gt; 1, I take 150m, and when you reach 1 I charge 1 &gt; 2, being 200m.  Q How does the service work?  A You are in fleet with me while I complete missions! This can either be via a fleet you create a fleet advert for me to join, or vice versa, or just manually where I invite you when I am online.  Q Do I need to be in the same system/constellation/region as you?  A No, you can be anywhere, even wormhole space.  Q Are you booked right now? Is there a waiting list?  A TSCA is not a single man operation. It's an Agency, after all. I operate it but we have dozens of mission runners all over the world. If I'm fully booked there will be several Agents ready to provide the service at all times.   Q Do I get bounties and rewards and LP?  A You get a split of the LP and the mission reward, but not bounties unless you are in the mission.  Q Do I keep them?  A Yes! Our prices are adjusted for this. The LP is yours to spend as you see fit, as is the ISK in your wallet.  Q How do you check my standings gain for payment?  A We use www.eveboard.com, which lists your standings. You may be asked to update them via this on a regular basis.  Q What timezone are you in/do you operate in?  A I'm English currently residing in the UK. Eve time is best. However I am not a single person. Our Employees number in the dozens and are in Belgium, Iceland, the US, France, Holland, Malasyia etc.   Q Do you still provide this service? The last bump is very old and I want these now!!  A I will always provide this service. I've done it since September 2009. The day I stop providing this service will be the day I die. Do not mail me with ""Do you still provide standings?"" The answer will always be ""Yes. What is your start point, end point, corporation and timezone?""",™

t5_2rdj4,PumpGuru,1345668508,"[West Paw Design](http://www.greencupboards.com/west-paw-design/c/) is the leader in the organic bed industry. The Organic Bumper Bed® is made with a removable organic cotton cover, helping our Earth by reducing the amount of chemicals we put into the ground. The cushion used on the inside of the donut dog bed is made from 100% recycled IntelliLoft®, which was previously plastic soda bottles. Since it takes less energy to clean and recycle plastic bottles than it does to make new plastic, you are not only helping keep plastic from going to landfills, but lowering the carbon footprint too.   Most dog beds are made of cheap, mass produced synthetic materials that are extremely harmful to animals. There have been studies done on the chemical levels of animal beds. They first started in [2008](http://www.ewg.org/reports/pets) and the public knowing has grown greatly over the years. [Triclosan](http://thebark.com/content/toxic-chemical-found-dog-beds-and-toys) has been found in a broad range of consumer products. This chemical has been known to cause insulin regulation and hinder brain function.   Overall, I believe if you love your pets as much as you love your kids you should always provide them with the best products possible. It may be a few bucks more but it totally worth every penny.

I won't really comment on that because of the small number of effective cannon rushes that have been performed against Terrans.  Zerg is a different matter. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise, but so long as you aren't building seven cannons---You usually come out really, really far ahead if you caused the Zerg to either cancel their Hatchery or out-right lose it. 'So long as you play safe and expand you will be fine. Just make sure to build defenses and prepare for an all in or nydus or something weird.   I'm a Master's Zerg and I can openly say that trying to come back from a lost Hatchery is near-impossible if you went Forge First when it comes to your first Hatchery being put down. ( Especially since this implies that your Spawning Pool is delayed and you can't really immediately send a proper counter-attack....Especially with the size of maps now. ) You can, however, recover from a cancelled hatchery. The Zerg should place a new hatchery at their third, after your cannon's are about to finish at his natural. It's still difficult, as your bases are spread out and you need to make units to take your Natural---But not that awful..  If you destroy the Hatchery while doing a cannon rush at the natural---Your friend is right. You are generally the winner, you are extremely far ahead, and so long as you didn't make 5+ cannons, you will stay ahead.   'Another important aspect is when to realize you are not going to be able to cannon rush and stopping making cannons. Sometimes, it's just enough damage to cause the Zerg to pull a ton of Drones and go back to your normal Fast-Expand plan.   ♥  ",♥

After a time you'll build up a thicker skin and these comments won't annoy you as much anymore ;)  The reason I would not block, is because there are people with constructive help. I personally like to give people some help after I recognized some of their errors in-game. It's really frustrating if the player auto-blocks everyone.  I had the worst experience a couple of months back (Silver league too b.t.w.). I still remember it. It was a match against a Terran. I send out my 9-probe to scout his base. No wall-off. One supply, no barracks. For a while, seeing something like this made me slow down my game, thinking ""my opponent is not very good. I'm way ahead"". Until I got caught off-guard by too many cheeses (proxy rax and so on). This time I did not want to make the same mistake. My game went into overdrive. I checked for proxy locations, went into full-defense mode. No proxies to be found... anywhere. I re-scout the base. Still no wall-off, 2 marines, 2 marauders, to my 20ish supply army, including one colossus (yes I built it before re-scouting, silly me).  At that point I had a fairly good idea what was going on: I was playing against someone new to the game, and I felt really bad. I did not want to make him lose interest in the game. My though process: ""Finish the game, and offer a few coaching games after"". So I attacked. He quit the game much faster than anticipated :(  The next thing I did was open a chat to discuss the game, only to find out that he blocked me. Probably because he just allows chats from friends. Out of desperation, I tried to contact him again a few times, but he logged off soon after.  I felt really bad then, and left the game as well. I was disappointed in myself :'( I was not able to give my opponent a ""good game"". Yes, I could have just parked my army outside his base, and start the chat. Which I now do if this situation comes up. But I didn't at that time. I still feel very bad now, thinking about it. If he'd accepted the chat, I am sure we could have had a couple of fun games...  ♥  *edit*: formatting ",♥
t5_2qh16,Gawdor,1345712189,"I have to be fair on one point. It **is** extremely effective for touch devices, and to that end if touch devices eclipse mousing devices in the enterprise, then there is the slightest of chances this could end up a belated success ... I am not holding my breath or betting a second mortgage on it though.  Even if you introduce a docked tablet into the enterprise, you will invariably wind up with a keyboard and mouse, I *tried* really hard to use a Dell ST1120 tablet in a dock with a keyboard, sans mouse and using my finger to navigate the device, it kinda worked if all I was doing was switching between email, web, and word processing ... but trying to navigate a larger number of apps became a chore.  I am thinking that Microsoft have banked on touch being the future, unfortunately they took the route of switching instead of transitioning tech in a world where the tech is transitioning and not switching, they have jumped the gun instead of nurturing the tech over the period of a few years giving people the option of classic or Metro with auto switching if there is a touch device and no mouse present. It could have been done easily, but someone somewhere either said ""fuck that"" or the myriad of staff at Microsoft never saw the forest for the trees.  ""We Shall See"" ™",™

t5_2rfxx,Skawurl,1345725038,"I wouldn't suggest orianna, as her gameplay can get really advanced, really quickly.  Same with Cassiopeia, instead I would get champions that have certain functions to get better at.  Personally starting with Ezreal, you learn skill shots really quickly, master him and it can get you over a lot of humps.  Next I would suggest mastering someone who has a key ultimate, one that brings a lot to a team fight and not purely for execution, try galio, amumu, or morgana to learn how to position yourself into a team to make yourself more effective when using AoE champions.  After that, each champions mechanics really start to differ from here, my last suggestion is to practice last hitting with champions you'd like to play and get used to their auto attack animation.  If you want a real challenge, attempt to last hit with the worst auto attack animation in the game, Karthus.  Don't use any of his skills, just practice last hitting with his god awful auto attack animation, it's really quite fun to master.  Most importantly is after you've gotten these basics down, positioning of AoE, skill shots, and last hitting, you'll need to master a champion which does take time.  Every champion is incredibly versatile so pick those that you're great with, not those who everyone else plays.  Teemo main is fine, but learn the builds and the proper kiting mechanics associated with that champion.  Right now I would only suggest to stay away from Sejuani, she's in an incredibly bad position from what I can tell, she's not quite a troll pick, but she does need some buffs which I hope come in a patch soon™  Other than that, champions will be balanced out for those a little too strong and those a little too weak, Eve's getting some good buffs as well as twitch, hopefully sej will fall in line too.",™

Nice, dickholes, thanks for the imagery there.  **Raiders**  I got nothing bad to say about you guys, you gave us Campbell *and* Michael Bush.  So thanks for that, and uh...good chat.  **Rams**  Christ, has it really been 2 decades since the greatest show on turf?  Seems like now it's the greatest shitshow on turf.  You guys should be ashamed that Steven Jackson is literally killing himself for your shitty team.  **Ravens**  Caw caw, mother fucker.  A couple years ago, the Bears came into town and your team beat the shit out of the Bears by a bunch.  I sat next to the visiting team's owners box and Michael McCaskey himself said ""sorry, we'll get 'em next time"" to me as he was leaving.  I didn't say shit back, it was a God awful loss.  So fuck you guys for that, k?    **Redskins**  OK, so this one might get a little personal here, and I apologize for that to my Redskin fan homeys on this board.  That said, here we go:  STFU you stupid ignorant Redskins fans.  Your team hasn't shown shit since the fucking 90s, why are you CONSTANTLY thinking your team is so damned good?  Every year, the morons I live around get all geeked up about the ""12 and 4"" season they're about to have.  Motherfucker, you haven't gone 12-4 or better since Bush 1 was in office.  STOP IT, you make yourself look bad, frigging idiots.  **Saints**  Ain't none of us give a single flying fuck about that bounty scandal shit, Jonathan fucking Vilma, or your head coach.  ***WE DON'T CARE***.  Ok?  **Seahawks** God I can't wait until my team plays yours this year.  It's so fucking ON.  I'm starting to develop a dislike of your team, based off the cockiness of your fans.  Fucking sea chickens.  Like a damned yard bird except on water.  **Steelers**  Old and slow.  Just like our defense.  Except maybe not.  We'll see.  I got nothing for you guys, except I hate how you're consistently good.  Fuck you guys.  **Texans**  One good season, boys.  Just 1.  Let's not get all crazy here.  A history of 8-8 indicates mediocrity.  If you do it again this year, I will LOL so fucking hard.  **Titans** I'm gonna draft Chris Johnson this year.  If he sucks, I will personally drive down to TN, find each and every one of you Titans fans on reddit and kick you square in the nuts for leading me to believe he could be good again.  So for your sake, and your ball's sake, I hope he does well.  I'm itching to kick some shit this year.  **Vikings**  Fuck your team for *almost* making me feel sorry for it.  Christ, what happened to you guys?  You're like the Charlie Brown of the NFL.  That's not a compliment, folks.  ",♥

t5_2qh1i,ropers,1345746636,"&gt; I know nothing about the historical basis for any of Alexander_Scriabin's statements, but if Hitler really didn't believe in the divinity of Christ, then...he was not Christian. That's kind of the basis for the entire faith, no?  Not by a long stretch. Let me put it like this: Many Buddhists don't believe in the divinity of the Buddha, yet they're still Buddhists.   Granted, I may have my own biases, because as a polytheist I have my own outsider's perspective, but I dare say that if you believe in the basic [desert monotheism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desert_monotheism) package (the one and only –jealous– God, Abrahamic morality, i.e. a unidimensional/scalar morality of ""good"" vs. ""evil"" with shades of grey in between, etc.), *and* you self-identify as a Christian, then the question of whether Jesus of Nazareth was actually divine or just a spiritually centrally important enlightened fellow human being is really just another one of those doctrinal questions that Christians like to (often violently) disagree with each other over. It's basically the same thing as the questions of whether or not those *walking-on-water* and *water-to-wine* miracles were literally true, or whether the host literally turns into the body of Christ. Furthermore, there are denominations, sects and flavours of Christianity that are [far more accommodating](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaker#Universalist) to [outside ideas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mormonism). Of course, there are those Christians who say that a Quaker or Mormon and essentially ""everybody except us"" isn't a *Real Christian™* either, but [see above](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/yo30p/history_buffs_and_history_teachers_of_reddit_what/c5xgksr). I say if it sounds like a duck and calls itself a duck... I strongly feel that religious identity is or largely should be self-assigned and declared. Does it make you a Christian if others (your parents, etc.) tell you that you are one? Okay, I'll even concede that there's some merit to the ""does the group accept me as a member"" approach, but no one else ought to be able to decide what you get to believe. IMNSHO, it's pretty much taken as read in Germany that Hitler was a Christian (albeit not a good one). I pretty much only ever hear quibbling about that from US-American Christians, which I think has more to do with US politics and culture wars than anything else.   &gt; Also, along with what someone else said: I think the point of this discussion was the idea that believe or lack thereof in a particular religion does not have a bearing on someone's actions, it's just a handy scapegoat.  Who's scapegoating? (I think my culture war association appears rather plausible...)  PS: I want to add something: I said before that it's pretty much taken as read in Germany that Hitler was a Christian. One reason that's so, one reason why German Christians don't really try to contest that point is that they're not going to lean themselves out of the window that far, because at least the members of the Nazi generation who are still alive do remember that most of them too were Christians and Nazis. They know that even if one could say that by some odd standard Hitler was ""technically not a Christian"", most Germans/Nazis definitely were. So they're just not going to go there. Of course the same culture wars aren't even really fought in Germany as they are in the US, so it would be pointless anyway, but even if they were, then that part –disputing that Christianity and Nazism were bedfellows– would be a no-win battle, and they know it. Most of those strident US Evangelists meanwhile don't know it, so as with many US culture wars, the stridency of their claims is really informed by obliviousness.",™

t5_2qzb6,dhlawrencexvii,1345753861,"So, here's the story...  The very first David Lawrence (I) was born in 1677 to Glanagh and Norah Lawrence, and the average age when bearing the next generation David Lawrence has been 20.01. David I fought alongside William Wallace, feeding him the line, ""Scotland must be free!"" He actually meant that he did not want to pay for anything, and was beheaded for being too talkative at royal functions. His wife was the real brains in the outfit, and was soon beheaded herself for being too brainy.  My family was from the Border region of Scotland, and the Lawrence spawn soon ruled much of the countryside, but got sick of all that golf and all that noise from the bagpipes. They did, understandably, miss the haggis, though, and having emigrated south to Brighton on the English seacoast, made the Lawrence fortune by introducing haggis fast food stands there (David III), noting that the British really don't care what good food tastes like.  We Lawrences made our way westward, across the Atlantic, and settled Jamestown with the East Indian Trading Company, where the haggis stands failed miserably (poor David IV). Agile were my ancestors, and haggis was quickly replaced, with the help of friendly yet incomprehensible native Americans, with their beloved ""corn dogs"" (V). It was with that simple and sodium-laced change that the Lawrence fortune began to grow at an exponential rate.  We've done quite well over the years, and have been actively controlling the economy, politics and social discourse in every organization from the Masons (David II) to the Trilateral Commission (VI) to the Star Chamber (XIV), even extending our influence to groups like The Weathermen, the Rebel Underground and New Kids on The Block (you may know my distant cousin, Joey ""Haggis"" Lawrence - nephew to XVI).  Each individual group we Lawrences control has a facade that guides and shepherds a different facet of society, but behind each is a profit motive. I eschewed all that, choosing instead to be an actor. My family has always kept that very, very quiet, trying to avoid the pain and embarrassment of me not having driven a bank into receivership (VIII), a hedge fund into bankruptcy (XI), or a slutty trollop from the wrong side of the tracks across state lines for a dangerous back alley abortion (XI - yep, same guy).  Nonetheless, I hold my head high.  You've also probably had a brush with Lawrence greatness, and not even known it. Here are a few facts: a particularly thoughtless David Lawrence (XII) married into the Heinz family when we controlled Pittsburgh, and then Pennsylvania politics, and demanded material change in the formulae of #4, #33 and yes, #57 of Heinz' 57 varieties. It is well known that a relative of mine founded Sarah Lawrence College (VII); it is *not* well known that I am, as a member of the family, allowed to date any coed there I desire, whether she has pedigree or not. My family has majority interest in the St. Lawrence Seaway. The ""La"" in La-Z-Boy is short for, yes, ""Lawrence"". We lease Lawrence, KS to the residents there for $1 per year. Lawrence™ is a registered US trademark: my crazy grandfather (XV) had threatened to demand licensing fees from everyone using the name, until we managed to have his drip adjusted.  As you can see, we Lawrences have been busy.  The truth? Because I could, and I had a few moments reading the very first email ever sent to me asking what the XVII in my name was all about, I started typing and made all that stuff up.  Here's the real story. When I had to choose a Screen Actors Guild name (they have to be unique), there were lots of David Lawrences already in the Guild. The same was true on IMDB.com, where I was the seventeenth to register my information, and where my name appeared as David H. Lawrence (XVII). So in an homage to my digital side, I chose that as the name I use as an actor, hoping that it would appear on IMDB.com as David H. Lawrence XVII (XVII). Just so you know, there's lots of humor in redundancy, you know.   Unfortunately, IMDB doesn't seem to want to end my name with the Roman numerals XVII, despite several plaintive pleas, expensive bribes and failed lawsuits. And, further, with the success of my recurring character on Heroes, IMDB ""upgraded"" my listing entirely, and now I am the first...David H. Lawrence (I).  Go figure - I just can't catch a break.  (Update: after becoming a beta tester for IMDB Pro, an insider fixed it. I now have my XVII: http://imdb.me/davidhlawrencexvii )  Thanks for asking. And thanks for watching, listening and reading.

I will try to help you as others have helped me, with the knowledge and the understanding and all the rest of it, as best I'm able. (Looks like /u/Reveelectrique would do a much better job.)  With regard to your first question: It all depends on what standard you use for success. ""Game"" works because it's predicated on a narrow, *very* short-term view of what heterosexual male-female relationships are all about. Men who can spit game and get women into bed are quite successful in achieving their piddling goals for the weekend. (Obviously there's nothing inherently wrong with short-term affairs with fully-informed, mutually consenting partners, etc etc.)  I can't pretend to speak for woman who are attracted to such things, but of course we all enjoy feeling special, having a good time, etc etc. There's nothing surprising about that. When it becomes a situation (as it so often does) where the guy doesn't call the next day (despite promises to the contrary), pretends not to remember the woman, or acts in some other disrespectful way, women likely wise up -- but by then it doesn't matter because the guy is on to his next target. (I'll put an asterisk here so I can refer to it later on. * There is is.)  However, once the thrill of the chase wears off, this guy realizes that his only mode of relating to women involves trickery, deceit, dishonesty, and other pathologies. He realizes he has no recourse for a relationship approaching actual fulfillment or contentment -- to say nothing of how he relates to his mother, sister, etc. If he has female friends, he's probably just trying to find a way to get her into bed. And this is just one of the examples of how patriarchy hurts men. (Footnote here about how of course some people prefer not to be in long-term relationships, and that's fine, and it all depends on what you want, and being communicative and honest with other people, etc etc.)  Let's return to my asterisk as a way to approach the questions in your second paragraph. The process I describe in the paragraph with the asterisk exists on a continuum, containing all the different ways guys have of spitting game. On one end (Let's call it The Awesome Zone) we find things like genuine conversation and honesty and being open. These things take a *long* time. Usually nightclubs are horrible places for these things. They tend to be less fun than body shots and [spinning around on the dance floor](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/ykiko/eli5_how_to_dance_with_a_girl_at_a_club/c5wfb0h).   On the other side of that continuum (The Horror Zone) we have forcible, violent rape committed against a person who is desperately struggling against the act. Everyone -- even Rep. Todd Akin -- agrees that things in The Horror Zone are abhorrent and to be avoided at all costs.  But just a little ways down the continuum, back toward The Awesome Zone but still very far away from it, are things like ignoring someone who's saying ""No"", but not struggling. And forcing yourself on someone who's too drunk to resist. And using drugs like rohypnol to obstruct the person's memory. These things are all rape, but they're sometimes considered less egregious forms of it.  Further toward The Awesome Zone (but still very far away from it) we have the aforementioned trickery, deception, lies, mind games, ""negging"", and other pathetic tactics used by the insidious PUA ""movement"". Here's where society comes in. Why? Because patriarchal culture -- what many people refer to as ""rape culture"" -- encourages guys to move further and further away from The Awesome Zone and closer and closer to The Horror Zone, because Real Men™ do whatever it takes to ""conquer"" the woman. If you can't get her into bed, then you must be a wimp, a wuss, a pansy, a dork, a loser, etc etc.   Every magazine featuring women in passive, hypersexualized positions and (un)dress sends guys this message. Every music video with mostly-naked babes being [body chopped](http://www.caroljadams.com/book_pron.html) sends this message. Every disempowered, flighty, emotions-only, intellect-never woman on ""reality TV"" sends this message. (Plenty of women buy into the scenarios presented above, for various reasons.) Every episode of *The Man Show* and every one of the 460 Hooters ""Restaurants"" in the US sends this message. It's about conquering, it's about domination, it's about ownership of the female body.  Also: I strongly recommend Jean Kilbourne's [Killing Us Softly](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-1993368502337678412) video series for another look at these important topics.  I hope this is helpful. If you're looking for actual dialogue and dialectic, please feel free to ask questions.

t5_2qh8e,Moustachiod_T-Rex,1345808832,"&gt;You're really trying to argue that the sexual dimorphism of our brains suggests that women are inherently less capable at logical thought than men.  No, he isn't trying to argue that.    As a biologist™ I can say that there is enormous sexual dimorphism within many species of Animalia. We all accept that the male of species X has different behaviours and morphology than the females of species X. These differences can be fine and sometimes they can be massive, but I can't think of a single example in which those differences are non-existent.   That's not at all controversial to say about any species other than humans. But why? You can measure differences between men and women. One great example is that: men produce lots of testosterone and only a small amount of oestrogen, while women are vice versa. These hormones are linked to physical and behavioural changes.   So then why can't people accept that maybe it's not entirely due to society that women and men make different (but equal) choices. And why is this always framed in a negative way. For instance I see people saying ""Society makes women not want to be engineers, society is evil"" but rarely do I see ""Society makes women not want to be garbagemen, janitors, miners or soldiers, society is evil"". You're pissed off because you're only looking at the jobs women don't do that are considered well-paying or high status, and ignoring the jobs women don't do that are really quite horrible, low paying, dangerous, etc.   So no, nobody is arguing that differences between men and women mean that women are 'incapable of logical thought'. They're arguing that women and men can sometimes make different choices, and that those choices aren't necessarily due to their upbringing or society. It's shocking that people consider this to be a controversial point.",™
t5_2qh6c,aim2free,1345810636,"Thanks for your comment ❣ I been away from internet for a while, vacaction and such. I would say that you have grasped the problem in a very similar way as I have but how to interpret things is a highly ambigous problem.  This is correct, when you say:  &gt; humanity's best interests *while living on Earth*  This is, however, somewhat more troublesome:   &gt; Furthermore, it seems that your perfect end goal is on Earth (it would seem).   My perfect end goal is a world without suffering and without unnecessary limitations where all people are good, and... where I can fly :-)  The big question is: Why are we here?  I feel that this world is too full of struggle and annoyances. Too much crazyness and selfishness and obscessions with different things where people are abused, stupid, violent and so on.  This is an unacceptable state for any world. This is the reason it has to be fixed, but I also consider the world so crazy that the most likely is that we are not meant to stay here. This is one reason why I'm not too positive to life extension technologies, as they can basically just make you stay longer in a kind of prison...  Anyway, I consider Love being the fundamental force. With Love everywhere in every mind and heart there doesn't need to be suffering.  My goal is to make this world a world full of Love. This doesn't imply that this world is where we should stay, but it could be the key to reach our ""heaven"".  One can just speculate, but my idea is that the world as we see it now is like a fence. When we have learned to live in this world, then the fence may be taken away and the real world in full glory appear.  I had actually a revelation in 1987, a visual one, in the evening, it lasted about 3 minutes under heavy convulsions and cold sweat. What I saw as a 2x2m picture flooding with light on my wall was the front page of this book, which was released by Keith Curtis a couple of years ago [After the Software Wars](http://keithcu.com/wordpress/?page_id=407). From 1987-2009 I hadn't understood what I had seen more than it was very positive and warm and I felt it was Love behind. I had seen what looked like a kind of portal on the left and that it looked like a wonderful city and people. When I saw the book 22 years later I immediately recognized it, and immediately understood the message.  What is the main problem with this world from my perspective is that we do not share our love and what is shareable to benefit all, and we also use technology in a way which is absurd, as we use technology to a large extent to control and supervise people, instead of helping and assisting people. As in the old dystopic visionary movie [Metropolis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolis_%28film%29) from 1927 by Fritz Lang. I asked Keith Curtis where the picture on the front page came from, and he told me that it was part of a larger work [Metriopolis 2208](http://thmc.deviantart.com/art/Metropolis-2208-75669429) by Niels Seifert, which was cool as I often used to refer to that movie :-)  This all made sense! After having seen that revelation in 1987 I immedietely became a believer and decided to do something about the world. I wrote a report (to finish a course) which was a vision about the technological and social development on Earth from 1987 to 2037, which I denoted ""TankeNyckeln"" (it's Swedish and could be interpreted as ""Mind Key"" or ""Mind Wrench"" (would with today's naming be a Tablet). My report was lost a few years but a friend had a copy and scanned it for me. I have put it [here for now](http://www.scribd.com/doc/94021562/TankeNyckeln), but I intend to translate it to English and a few other languages.   The predictions during these 25 years have been highly accurate. Even the fact that [ARM processor](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/epic/arm/8243162/History-of-ARM-from-Acorn-to-Apple.html) now is the one being encouraged by the big ones :-) The ARM, which was released 1987 and I proposed as the basis for the TankeNyckeln is now even [used for brain simulations](http://www.eetimes.com/electronics-news/4217840/Million-ARM-cores-brain-simulator) and already in most smartphones and tablets.  The last pages about 2037 describes a world without suffering, without wars, violence, crimes, abuse and starvation. A world full of Love and collaboration.  As I consider the big contemporary prophets to be [Richard Stallman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman) and [Richard Falkvinge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Falkvinge), I made [this somewhat jokular picture](http://bloggar.computersweden.idg.se/hardcoreopensource/files/2011/04/Metropolis.png) with Stallman (which sounds like Superman in Swedish) to the left, me in the middle and Falkvinge to the right in April 2011.  Basically what Jesus said was to share your love and your things, which he illustrated well with the fishes and the breads. This is exactly what Stallman says [about software](http://www.gnu.org/music/free-software-song.en.html) and Falkvinge about [knowledge, information and culture](http://falkvinge.net/2012/06/02/the-game-of-acta-mid-battle-analysis-next-actions/). For my own has been a patent abolishonist the last 12 years, but got very happy  when the Pirate party was funded in late 2005, to support my visions about a free world.  To generalize the concept of software freedom to immaterial as well as material freedom I have forked the general public license into [Generic Pitchfork Licence](http://wish-it.se/gpl) suitable for an arbitrarily advanced technology (as exemplified by the fishes and the bread by Jesus).",❣

Which is more evil, to torture someone, or to kill them without trial?  Bush tortured people, and I thought the US couldn't sink any lower, but then we got a Democratic President who decided it was ok to assassinate Americans.  So which is the lesser evil, really?  Maybe you think the Dems are less evil because they talk about helping the poor, but they don't actually help the poor when they have control of the government.  Clinton was the President under which Welfare got cut.  The way this country works is this: when the owners need something anti-Left done, they do it under a Dem President.  When they needs something anti-Right done, they do it under a GOP President.  Why?  Because the cheerleaders won't go after ""Their Guy™"".

Rather, both systems of oppression are virus-like monsters of social infection, against which we must struggle and resist.  I understand your frustration, since patriarchal thinking is by its very design based on exactly the split-personality psychopathy embodied in those fictional characters.  For example, when a man has a daughter, it's quite common for him to suddenly recognize all of the hideous, piggish, violent, obnoxious, predatory behaviors he has participated in during the earlier parts of his life. This has been a constant theme of comedy from Bill Cosby (""I know how men think. I used to be one."") to *30 Rock* (""Wait a second. Is *every* woman someone's daughter!?""), but of course these jokes disguise a serious flaw in the male psyche.

t5_2sode,scartol,1345816395,"This is my first experience with that song, and while I agree with you that a distinction must be made between art and personal narrative, I will make the following point:  The author/speaker split is decidedly more difficult in hip-hop than in *any other art form*, because from its very beginning, hip-hop has always and forever been about ""keeping it real"". When the Geto Boys describe how [their minds were playing tricks on them](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KutXyPEEbQs), it's not some abstract artistic statement -- it's a painful narrative dredged from years of violent street hustle and actual suffering. When Ice Cube talks about [medicine in low-income areas](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m04b0rRKT6o), he's not giving an academic overview of the flaws in for-profit health care -- he's describing what it's like for poor black people trying to get medical help.  This is not to say that it's impossible for a rapper like Mr. The Creator to create a persona which is totally separate from his actual identity. But the question then becomes: What is the purpose of this persona, and what are we to understand about human nature or his experience/philosophy/whatever based on the stories in his work? It seems to me that -- like Eminem before him -- Tyler is mostly working with ""stuff gets crazy in my head sometimes"" (hardly a blinding or even significant statement) and ""it's just a joke"" (which is a sorry excuse for a defense of something so abhorrent).   I love literary works that examine the darker side of human experience. Dostoyevsky's *Notes from Under Ground*, Poe's *Cask of Amontillado*, Dambudzo Marechera's [Black Sunlight](http://www.penguinclassics.co.uk/nf/Book/BookDisplay/0,,9780143026204,00.html) -- these texts do a good job of obeying the (probably apocryphal) instruction from the French writer Colette to ""Look at that which pleases you for a long time, and that which displeases you for a longer time."" I simply do *not* get this from anyone in Odd Future. Instead it strikes me as simplistic nihilism and intentionally shocking, because that's the Flavor of the Month™.  [I also wrote about Tyler the Creator on my blog last year.](http://www.fbesp.org/synapse/?p=288) Perhaps you'd like to have a look.  &gt;As disturbed as I am by the sexism in these clips, sexism alone does not disturb me in this way. I’ve learned how to critique the negative gender dynamics in so much of the hip-hop I love, while simultaneously celebrating the positive, artistically viable elements — often in the same song!  &gt;What bothers me about these videos is the gruesome gendered violence, aimed specifically at women. It is sexualized violence, the same type that showed up in Cronenberg’s epically stupid movie A History of Violence (which disturbed me every bit as much as these videos, lest anyone think I’m picking on the poor rappers here).",™

Why would this be? First, the largest sex organ we possess is the brain, so if you are smart, the sexual fantasies you have will be much richer, detailed and kinkier than the rest. Secondly, if you are in a position of control or high stress and are dominant throughout the workday, taking a break from also being sexually dominant is necessary for balance. That doesn’t mean my clients want to be dominated all the time. Just every once in a while when the pressure builds up.”",♥

That's why they're douchebags and the Apple family isn't. The show says as much.  &gt; Also, so what if ponies have genetically inherent potentials that result in disparities in ability and economic utility? By specializing according to their own comparative advantage, everypony could allow their income to transcend their productive possibilities regardless of the absolute advantages of others;  And that's what they do. The only thing is, there are many ponies who have clearly moved past thinking of it in terms of ""income,"" who are no longer mired in antiquated notions of score-keeping.  &gt; this is a very basic microeconomic lesson, and demonstrates how specialization and free trade can allow anyone to economically uplift themselves in a free market,  Correction: It can allow anyone who was born with enough breathing room to develop specialized skills (rather than having to work 18 hours a day in a sweatshop to keep from starving the instant they turn 13) and who is lucky enough to not be dragged down by forces beyond their control to economically uplift themselves. The rest of us? SOL, and if the market reigns supreme, there is literally nothing we can do about it.  &gt; rather than to drag others down for the sake of equality.  The rich ponies in Canterlot seem to be doing just fine. Rich humans would still do just fine in an economy of true choice.  &gt; This is why Cutie-Marks are so important to ponies: they help identify their niche in the market.  That's the thing. You're viewing everything solely in terms of its value to The Market™, when the ponies could easily have moved past that.  &gt; Eonomic liberty necessarily implies the freedom to withdraw consent in unwanted transactions. Look at Fluttershy: she hardly socializes outside of her circle of close friends, and lives a self-sustaining lifestyle at the fringes of the Everfree Forest, only rarely purchasing goods and services in the market.

t5_2upm6,thaiinblack,1345829275,"Beef cattle keeping by smallholders in a  mountainous province of northern Vietnam in relation to poverty status,  community remoteness and ethnicity.  Huyen Le Thi Thanh, Tuyet Van Dinh Thi,  Andre' Markemann, Pera Herold, Anne Valle Zate. Animal production  science, acepted 1 Aug 2012 (CSIRO).   Abstract: Vietnam's national beef demand is  continuously increasing, but is not able to be satisfied by domestic  supply. Because land scarcity is a major constraint to beef production  in many parts of the country, attempts to enhance beef production in  Vietnam have focused on small-scale household farms in remoter areas.  The present study aimed to investigate the relation between cattle  keeping and poverty status of household farms in Son La province,  Northwest Vietnam. In addition, altitude, community remoteness and  technology adoption of the investigated households were considered for  an evaluation of the feasibility of smallholder beef cattle production  in the upland areas. Data on livestock production of 299 randomly  selected households of different ethnic groups in the lowlands and  highlands of Yen Chau district, Son La province, were collected by using  structured and standardized questionnaires. The poverty status of the  households was defined on basis of daily per-capita expenditures (DPCE),  dividing the investigated households into poor and non-poor farmers  with DPCE below and above the rural poverty line, respectively. Cattle  keeping farms in Yen Chau district showed advantages in terms of  available land and labour resources compared to non-cattle keeping  farms. Cattle were kept mainly by non-poor farmers, particularly the  Thai, whose farm holdings are most commonly located in the lowlands. The  number of cattle raised on farm was related to the poverty status of  the households and remoteness. Cattle compete with other livestock in  the use of limited farm resources. Cattle keeping farms more frequently  applied feeding innovations to reduce feed competition on farm than the  non-cattle keeping households. For the very poor, small animals are more  appropriate than beef cattle production activities. Only in the  identified advantageous regions, smallholder farmers might engage in  beef production, if appropriate policies are implemented to support them  in raising cattle. Consequently, the development of beef production  under those conditions could contribute to poverty reduction by  increasing smallholderâ€™s incomes in the remote highland regions.

If you are taking classes that can be considered pharmacy related those can count (I used some that way).  Also if you belong to your state pharmacy association they often have continuing education credits you can earn by attending their meetings.  Other ways include drug rep talks where they often serve you dinner and you learn.  As long as they along technicians to attend and give you CE credit through technician specific questions you can use those and usually are free.  Hopefully you have went to nabp.net where you can create a profile and easily track all your continuing education credits.  That is a great place for technicians and pharmacists alike to track their CEUs.  On the PTCB website they list these places to obtain CEUs:   American Pharmacists Association American Society of Health-System Pharmacists Illinois Council of Health-System Pharmacists Michigan Pharmacists Association National Pharmacy Technician Association Pharmacy Technician's Letter Pharmacy Times Power-Pak C.E.® RxSchool ® U.S. Pharmacist    These are just a few examples and included the Power-Pak but I suggest if you are a member of a state organization to look there as they are free usually if you are a member or contact them to see how much they cost.  I haven't done the project or anything like that but it says that subject matter may include medication distribution, inventory control, pharmacy law, drug therapy, pharmacy operations, etc.  You setup a project regarding controlling your store's inventory or heading the form creation, utilization, and documentation for your pharmacy's MTM program or something along those lines.  I think as long as you can show that it relates to pharmacy, your pharmacist will fill out the form, sign off on it, and it allows for learning three objectives you are golden.  Good luck! ",®

t5_2sokd,MrTurburdaugh,1345859904,"Okay well here's the low-down up-town around scoopidy doop.  I am an extraordinary expert in all types of machines and I wrote my PhD about things that Turing so I believe I can help you out here.  I will include a wonderful historical story from history along with my explanation but keep in mind I failed history 46 times from 1906-1912 when I had to continually repeat mean old Mr. Kevin's junior high history exxxxxtravaganza! so the historical element in this story may be entirely made up.  In 1906, coincidentally the same year I began failing history, a young, proper Englishman named Alan Turning began studying in the fascinating field of ultrafast surgical techniques that could be performed while skydiving.  One of his greatest disasters came in 1908, when the printing press was invented by Eli Whitney.  Turning attempted to learn how to use it, but was baffled by the confounded nature of the machine.  Having only one 'n', he spent many years researching how to use the machine to print his name.  Finally, in 1978, he settled on just changing his name to 'Turing' because 'Turnig' sounds stupid.  But from that point on, he vowed that he would spend his time creating a mathematical model that would one day allow us to make Microsoft® Word where you can have as many 'n's as you want.  And, of course, leads us to his famous machine.  His first 19 attempts (many of which were destroyed when Napoleon invaded Mars in 2263) were actually pretty much exact replicas of a printing press.  This is when he made his first realization.  ""Eureka!""  He exclaimed, while clothed (unlike the famous philosophiser Archimesocralato).  ""My machine is not going to physically sit around and print words onto a computer monitor.  It must be an abstract construction!  Turing immediately ran to his most trusted academic partner and closest friend, Macho Man Randy Savage, to work through his thoughts.  ""Listen Andre,"" Turing said.  ""Randy..."" replied Macho Man Randy Savage.  ""Whatever.  Anyway, my machine is going to be capable of doing anything - anything anyone can dream up!  If you only have one 'n' well gosh darnit you can still print your entire name instead of living a life of shame and regret.""  ""Hold on a second,"" said Macho Man Randy Savage, parsing through a textbook on Logic, ""Gödel's incompleteness theorem, published in 2005 by the aptly-named Gödel's incompleteness, says that no universal set of axioms can possibly exist.  No matter how powerful your machine is at granting wishes, there will still be wishes that it can't grant.  It's not a star rod.""  He said incredulously.  Macho Man Randy Savage loves the Paper Mario games.  ""You're right...""  Turing pondered.  ""Hold on, though.  I understand that there are problems that can't be solved by my model, but that's okay.  It will be universal to a very, very important set of problems.  In particular, any problem that is algorithmically decidable will be solvable on my simple mathematical model!  ""Whoa there""  said Macho Man Randy Savage, ""that was a pretty dense statement you just made.  Despite my PhD in computer science where I have extensively studied the set of decidable languages, you should tell me what they are for expositions' sake.""  ""Hey sure thing"" said Turing gleefully.  ""A problem is considered to be decidable if it's computable by an algorithm - essentially, if there's a series of steps that someone can take exactly to get from point A to point B it would turn out exactly the same way every time.  Consider a very basic problem.  I have seven apples in my right hand and one hundred and fourteen apples in my left hand.  If I asked you to tell me how many apples I had, how would you know?""  ""Holy funnelcakes you really do have that many apples!""  Exclaimed Macho Man Randy Savage.  ""However, it's addition.  Addition is a pretty straightforward algorithm.  I know, in my head, what the sum of any two one-digit numbers is.  For example, I can look at 7 and 4 and add them together using predetermined, unchanging information and get 11.  The one then carries, which can be determined by seeing that I now have a two-digit result, and the process repeats as I go down the line.  I can do it for any number, no matter how large.""  ""Exactly!""  Turing said.  ""Now let's think about the fundamental parts of this algorithm as you described it.  You told me you had several very important things in your mind.  Let's go over them!""  ""First, you have the fundamental knowledge of how to add.  And how do we know how to add?  We feed two numbers into that number cruncher you call a head and it spits out another number.""  ""Now, I'm going to write out all the numbers from 1 to 18 on a piece of paper.  18 is the largest number that two one-digit numbers can add up to.  Now, starting from each one digit number, I want you to draw a line to its sum with the second number labelled on the line.  For instance, let's draw a line from '1' to '6' and label it '5', indicating that '5' and '1' add up to '6'.""  ""This seems really tedious"" said Macho Man Randy Savage, while somehow drawing a line from 8 to 1803 and labeling it 'purple'.  ""Yes.  That's why my machine will do it.  This part of the machine is what I call a Deterministic Finite Automata, named after my friend and colleague Deterministic Finite Kevin.  We can give it a one digit number and a starting point (the second point) and after following one line, we have the sum of the two numbers.""  ""Okay, so the machine has some process that determines how to add.  Good, but now what do I do once I have that sum?  Right now we lose that information as soon as the machine gets another input and starting point!  I can't even finish this simple addition problem!""  ""Never fear, Hulk Hogan!  Our Finite Automata has no persistent state, but how do people remember things?""  Turing looked down at the piece of paper still in Macho Man Randy Savage's hand.   ""Ahh you clever dog!""  Said Macho Man Randy Savage, finally understanding what the second essential piece was.  ""We can take the result from the finite automata and write it down!  Once its written down, the machine can tell the finite automata to run again and write down again, and so on and so forth!""  ""Right.  And here's what's even cooler - a finite automata can do ALL of that managing operations for us.  We can have states that say: 'run add on the first two things I see on the paper' 'write down result' 'run add on the next two things' 'is there anything left on the paper to run?'  This automata will be more complicated, but is easily constructable without a persistent state.  It can also run ad infinitum, which allows us to add numbers with as many digits as we desire!""  ""We're gonna need infinite paper for that man..."" said Macho Man Randy Savage.  ""Okay, you've got me hooked.  But this is just simple addition!  How would you manage more complicated problems?""  ""Well, think about this.  Isn't addition just a building block for so many pieces in mathematics?  Well, we just built ourselves one of the most basic building blocks.  I will spend a lot of time proving my Church-Turing thesis, which will state that any arbitrary algorithm can be constructed through the use of our two important pieces: the definite finite automata which contains our rules and operating instructions, and the persistent state, or memory, which we use to record and recall information.""  (Historical note: it is called the Church-Turing thesis because Turing was at odds with the church at the time for going against the papally held belief that the Sun revolved around the Earth.  He named his thesis after the Church to try to make amends.  He also sent them some edible arrangements.  Mmmm!)  ""Unfortunately, the incompleteness theorem is kinda a thorn in my side."" Lamented Turing.  ""See, this machine can't decide problems that are undecidable.  Seems like a self-fulfilling definition there but I promise it's a little important.  Take, for example, the problem of trying to decide whether an arbitrary Turing Machine will ever finish its operation.  Addition is easy - we can look at the automata and decide right away whether or it will get a result or not.  But since we throw a persistent, changeable state into the mix with my machine, we can't always know.""  ""Fortunately, problems that are this hard can't be solved by anyone.  Therefore, I guess my machine is good enough.""  Anything that a computer can do, a Turing Machine can do.  As Macho Man Randy Savage learned, any algorithm can be constructed so that it can be run on a Turing Machine.  This provides a mathematical, abstract representation so that we can study the properties of computation.  Important things include the aforementioned decidability, computational complexity (how long an algorithm will take to run or how much memory it will require), or even recognizability (whether a machine can even recognize a correct answer when it sees one).  Turing would go on to sell his abstract, theoretical machine on eBay to hopeless scrubs who pay for things that don't exist.  He made a fortune and retired to live on Mars with Napoleon and Macho Man Randy Savage, whose name Turing still has yet to learn.",®
t5_2tnz9,Illuminatesfolly,1345860051,"&gt;I made the modern art connection too. Literal-minded empiricists fail to see the value of anything subjective. They are too object oriented to devote effort to anything but cut-and-dry provable facts. They feel insecure around art interpretation, so they adopt a suspicious view of it as worthless sophistry, effectively disregarding it and minimizing the complexity of their own internal realities.  Disagree! (Slightly?)  The problem with the STEM majors generalized is the lack of perspective, and only that! Literal minded empiricism is not something that precludes the recognition of 'hermeneutic tyranny' in subjectivism; it is the only defense against it! Empirical research is the only means to verifying something true™ about the natural world. Even then, empiricism rests on assumptions that will, for all of time, be unverifiable assumptions about the nature of the universe. Empirical research and scientific thought are the means to escape the oppression (/jerk) of death itself, as death represents in its coming the failure of order and the loss of discerned truths to the ever present interpretations of human cosmogonical subjectivism.   *""To be a neckbeard STEM major is to be alive.""*   *-Ron Jesus Sagan Tyson*  If I were to make a suggestion to Redditors that fall into the generalization of this comment justly, it would be:  The STEM major needn't sacrifice their humanity for their skills in programming, but rather, should spend their necessary GE credit understanding the humanitarian context of Science. This is the failure of most posts on Reddit, and the failure that all Scientists must overcome in their understanding of the world if they are to evolve their constant anger into resigned despair.

t5_2qh1i,Again_what_learned,1345918604,"Copied from a previous post, here is my terrible proposal story:   My gf (now wife) and I had been enduring an LDR, as she was forced to return to the UK when her work visa expired. We'd decided we were in it for the long haul, so I was sponsoring her, but it was a long process.   1 year into the L-D part of the relationship , I was sure. I had asked her for ring size a long time ago, so I could surprise her, but she ABSOLUTELY failed at measuring her hand. She gave an wildly inaccuratesize. Like an R. that’s a UK sizing for GODDAMNED MASSIVE. this caused me to have the size converted when looking for rings and have a lot of trouble finding rings that could be resized to that point. I guess that is one excuse I have for not realizing I was buying a goddamned hoola hoop.   Anyways, I run around Vancouver trying to find a ring in this size. I had in my head a ring we’d seen on a wonderful trip to Vienna together, when I was there for work and she was able to meet me there from the UK. It was an antique, and very yellow gold, with a three stone setting, but understated, and she loved it. I made the mistake of not getting it that time. But yellow gold and three stone settings are not all created equal.   So I finally found a ring that was proportionate to Shrek, and it’s gold and three stone, so I get it. It’s huge. I don’t think. I just get something which I think will be right, and reminded me of my ever fuzzier memory of this other ring. Seriously this thing was massive. It could be mistaken for a wrestling championship belt. And ugly.   So I take this massive ring in its massive box and get on a plane for a planned trip to see her at her parents place near London. We had planned a trip to a manor, where we’d visited the first time I came to England. It was my plan to propose then and there., on a nearby field where we’d had a picnic.  BUT IT WAS CLOSED.   I found out the day before, so I am at a loss. We look at other trips to take. Everything is closed or not really right. And I only had 4 days left in the country.   So my gf mentions she promised that she would visit and help out her friend’s horses. I’d been there before and it was in the English country side. It was beautiful and sunny and pastoral. I thought it would work.   So I hid my massive ring box in my Gore-Tex jacket, despite not a cloud in the sky, and say “I just like having a jacket”. We get to the place, it’s a beautiful place. It’s a great day.   We proceed to muck out the stalls. For over half an hour, we are raking out horseshit. And I am getting more nervous. There’s no chance in my mind to delay this, I will propose. When we’re done, I ask if we can take a walk. She thinks it odd, especially as I take my jacket. We go up the hill, and at the first clearing, stumbling, I trip over my hastily prepared lines, and show her a ring box the size of my fist and open it to reveal a clusterfuck of a ring the size of a bracelet.   It was not my finest moment.   We go shopping for a proper ring the next day, and show it off to her family.  I returned the Shrek ring ™ for our wedding bands, and it’s a funny story now. All good.  TL;DR - Got a huge ugly ring, proposed after digging up horseshit for an hour. ",™

See, XSLT is the only decent way to apply markup decorations (navigation bar, header, footer, etc) to a bare web page, and XSLT accepts only XML as input.  This makes it a perfect use case for HTML5's XML serialization: HTML5 → XSLT → HTML5 with said decorations  You *can* do things like this with any old templating system like FreeMarker or PHP, but then there's no guarantees that the result is well-formed, everything that needs to be escaped is, etc. Ugly, messy, error-prone, and generally not worth the massive pain in the ass that it is.  You also can't do fun things like expanding macro elements (e.g. `&lt;w:copyright/&gt;` → `&lt;span class=""copyright""&gt;Copyright © Whatever&lt;/span&gt;`) without XSLT or something like it.

Here's  a summary of the presentation on nicotine. Here's  the keynote address from that year on youtube, just in case you doubt the whole thing even exists.  I think my point wasn't coming across. I know I could hunt it down myself, the point was I shouldn't have to. The internet has been around long enough for people (and by that I mean media) to figure out that movable type limitations don't apply, space is not really a premium. They could and should have linked to the stuff you just did, falling short of that is just bad journalism on their part. It doesn't really matter if I or anyone else could understand it, if they're going to cite it they should also reference it. (and no, not a cardiologist, but I'm told I can make hearts skip a beat... I don't believe it myself)  &gt;If you're so willing to reject information unless it's sourced, and unless that source has some clickable blue text, why didn't you cry foul at OP's article? It's the exact same amount of content and sources as the article that we're apparently fighting about.  No reason other than I must not have been paying attention at that particular moment.  &gt;Scientific consensus built over time on a foundation of good studies that are part of a larger body of research  That's the biggest problem I have with most of the current studies on nicotine or even tobacco. Those studies are *actually* studies on inhaling a burning cigarette, but the conclusions they come to are that all nicotine is bad, all tobacco is bad, etc. It's crap science and they should be ashamed of themselves, but nobody is calling them out on it because smoking and anything related is Evil™.  &gt;I just get passionate about this sort of thing  Well, that makes two of us. :)",™

Bränna kyrkor osv känns brutalt. Räcker med en rivning på vanligt sätt. Sen att folk får tänka på Gud om dom vill, det kan man ju så klart inte reglera. Tänka är fritt, men att utöva religion samt bygga religiösa byggnader och ha på sig religiösa symboler och plagg är ju nåt vi kan förbjuda. Eller helst bara få folk att inse hur jävla dumt det är.

(I'm still a fan, but seriously, I went through a pretty serious obsessive phase.) My dad got me concert tickets as a Christmas gift to see him in Toronto, and I booked a campus tour of York University so I could skip school and go to Canada for the day.  David Bowie canceled that concert because he got laryngitis or something. It wasn't rescheduled for several months, and when I found out the date I called my dad to make sure he could get off from work and other arrangements, and he said no problem. For months I was on him about this, and the night before he says he can't go. I had less that 24 hours to find someone willing to drive four hours to another country to go see David Bowie (and it's not even like I had the tickets in my hand; he'd hung onto them … or had sold them, I still don't know).  It didn't end up happening. That was 2004. David Bowie has not toured since. I'm still a little broken up about it.  I've forgiven my dad since then — it was a pretty serious affront to seventeen-year-old me. He's making it up to me by taking me to see Bruce Springsteen next week.  I'm looking forward to it, but I also got my ticket from him three days ago. Just In Case™.",™

I really do hope your fear or startle-ness is real and not fake. And I do hope you get your views as a LPer and not just because you're female.  **Video:**  * Fancy title intro. Quick and recognizable. Pretty big though, but that's me. It's not bad since you stood still and whatnot.  * Watching this at 720p. To my eye, there's not much of a quality increase, but a sharpness and color increase. Seems good, but there's some grain to it. I think this was rendered at h.264 or wmv. I get the same problem with my Dead Space LP. The only fix is some minor color correction and contrast. May want to look into this, but I doubt it'll be needed since Bioshock has a natural dark tone. Course this is because I was looking for video errors.  * I don't think you needed to transition solving the puzzle unless you messed up. I believe some people would like to ridicule you (you're only human) for messing up once or twice. I died about 3-4 times and started transitioning those quick stupid deaths one after another keeping the good commentary.  * If I recall correctly, this game has the option to enable subtitles. Enable it. Do it. This is not mainly a recommendation or an option. Trust me on this. There's no real down-side to enabling this. You sometimes speak over the in-game vocal audio and if you can't fix this or get around it the subtitles will really help you out. This seems to benefit you more because you do like to reply during character vocal scenes (it's fun), so the subtitles will really help balance it out for those who are curious to what they characters are saying.  * I found your ending to be redundant. In fact I find all endings that use LP footage of the game they're lp'ing at the end to be redundant. This is a personal note and not a neutral or general stand-point. I think it would be best to highlight a clip at the end of another game you have LPd or another video. But if you're trying to use the end to high-light (what you believed to be) funny parts in your LP, I think it would be best to highlight what you just showed in the ep, even if it wasn't considered a best in your opinion. Although I must say it was quite hilarious seeing you freak out.  **Audio**  * Quick introduction and welcome. Fancy and basic.  * Mic quality. That's kinda loud. I can't quite explain it, but it's not in terms of how loud you are, but how much the audio is booming. I know your mic has a pop filter, but I think the mic is too close to your mouth because after speaking I can hear the 'after-breath'. There's an issue with this because I feel like you were using a DB boost, but that might not be the case.  I honestly can't pin point it, but if you listen closely to a clear audio track in a LP and listen to yours. You may understand what I mean by the ""boom"" in your commentary audio if you compare it to [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOupGPpjfJU#t=4m20s) or [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wozFfzAfVY#t=6m57s) (listen for about 20 seconds). His audio doesn't seem pressured of the sort. It sounds natural and well balanced. This may be a bit hard for you depending on how loudly or softly you speak. I've had some issues myself with this and thanks to a couple of peer reviews here I think I've gotten the hang of it. What I do is sing and try to hold notes and keep that level of commentary and audio without mumbling. What I would normally mumble I would also try to keep at that audio range.  * Game audio is pretty low. I want to hear Atlas' manly voice! May need to balance the **in-game vocal audio with music/sfx audio**. I think your commentary and game commentary audio is at a good balance.  * ~ok~ balance of keeping quite during in-game audio, but it can be worked a little better. It's kinda hard when it comes to games like these, but the best thing is to surrender and yield to in-game audio. This is your call though to have your viewer want to listen to you or story. I like to not talk because it gives me time to think about commentary about the situation, my thoughts during or after, etc.    **Commentary:**  * The commentary isn't anything special. It is listen-to-able, but for those who are looking for hilarity and unique-ness they might not find it here (in this LP).   * You suffer from the same problem I did (and maybe still do at points, but I am trying to fix that). You tend to announce things you are already doing or looking at a lot. It's ok to this, but not for the whole video. You have bits you ridicule the splicer's death because of science. And then there's another bit after the first memory part where you're trying to get a door to open (before seeing a dead big daddy). That's good. Try to work around that.  * This part didn't really have you whimpering and it seems to be a newer Bioshock LP part. Not much action here, but more of conveying the game. S'all good. Some parts have em, some don't.  * You started off so well with the LP, but I felt like some of the energy was lost (then somehow for a bit regained later on). This did affect your commentary a bit.  **Final Thoughts:**  * The LP wasn't that long. In fact it was barely considered medium length. That's fine with me, but I've found people prefer a 15-24 minute length LP. First-time seeing your LP I was a liiitle engaged, enough to want to keep watching a little more, but it already ended. I think you could have had me or the audience for another 5 more minutes.  * Not a fan of using a gimmick/sexuality/ethnicity to promote oneself, but that's me. I'm not going to tell you that calling yourself A.W.C isn't going to get you less views because that will be a lie. People do fall for that. I also kind of promote this at the same time because I think it'll help more females come out more and not hide themselves to the internet (though I don't blame 'em). This is more a personal thing based on how many people I've met online only to turn out they were female and were nervous on how I or others would react after revealing themselves online.  * You definitely have potential if you fix your mic-quality / volume issue and keep some good energetic commentary. This means clear, understandable vocals, following by quirky comments and remarks.  * I was annoyed a bit when you talked over the game's character dialogue audio. This is me personally, but I'm sure no one likes to listen to two voices at a time and have their brain figure out who to listen to only to figure out before it's too late (Eg. they already finished saying their dialogue after deciding who to pay attention to).  * If I weren't criticizing your video I **MAY** would have left about 7 minutes in (when you reach the machine after the harvest option), but at the same time I saw that I was half-way done. If I wasn't criticizing your video I probably would have stayed because I did keep a small interest at the 8 minute marker. This is because of the big-daddy fight.  * I'll check up on you randomly again maybe around the 1X part of your LP to see how you've improved. I've always tried to finish Bioshock, but I always get as far to Andrew Ryan before I get bored with the game. Watching your LP will be a get around to finally ""finishing"" Bioshock and close that chapter.  Unless I really emphasized you to consider it or do the option provided, remember that this is just critique from one person and this information should be used to reflect and review yourself and maybe open your mind to any problems I or you have missed. There is always room for improvement.  P.S. I just want to throw out that I'm more of someone who only watches/listens to LP if the voice is right. You, my good lass, give me an iffy impression on whether or not I will stay after Bioshock (assuming I stayed for it). This is personal. I'm sure others nit-pick with other things just as much as I do.",♥

t5_mouw,delldell,1346094176,"Circumcision is the only surgery in history ever recommended as a universal means of preventing disease. Nowhere else in medicine is surgery on a healthy organ considered an alternative to proper hygiene. The claim that circumcision prevents AIDS was made on the basis of observational studies of men already circumcised and randomized controlled trials where men underwent a circumcision at the start of the study.  All of the studies attempted to predict what happened on a microscopic level by studying conditions on a macro level, which is far less precise. Researchers were not able to observe exactly when, where, or how each individual got infected. Therefore, a fundamental assumption was made that is possible to draw conclusions about the mode of transmission of HIV by enumerating the success of transmission in specific populations.  [Regarding penile sensitivity and HIV transmission], the most common reason men give for not wearing a condom is that it reduces sensation and pleasure. Circumcised men experience a progressive loss of sensitivity as a result of their circumcision, [which] will only discourage condom use further.  [Furthermore], loss of penile skin from circumcision frequently results in tightened, scarred skin on the erect penis.  This eventually increases friction during intercourse, which increases the likelihood of abrasion through which HIV can pass…[also], circumcision advocates propose to persuade men to be circumcised because it will protect them, and afterwards tell them not to have unprotected sex because it won’t protect them. This dangerous [and confusing] message may make many circumcised men worldwide feel that since they are now [supposedly] at decreased risk, they are sufficiently protected without condoms.

Kanin, in over 40 percent of the cases reviewed, the complainants eventually admitted that no rape had occurred (â €œArchives of Sexual Behavior,â€ Vol. 23, No. 1, 1994). Kanin also studied rape allegations in two large Midwestern universities and found that 50 percent of the allegations were recanted by the accuser. ... Kanin's findings are hardly unique. In 1985 the Air Force conducted a study of 556 rape accusations. Over one quarter of the accusers admitted, either just before they took a lie detector test of after they had failed it, that no rape occurred. A further investigation by independent reviewers found that 60 percent of the original rape allegations were false. ... According to a 1996 Department of Justice Report, of the roughly 10,000 sexual assault cases analyzed with DNA evidence over the previous seven years, 2,000 excluded the primary suspect, and another 2,000 were inconclusive. The report notes that these figures mirror an informal National Institute of Justice survey of private laboratories, and suggests that there exists ""some strong, underlying systemic problems that generate erroneous accusations and convictions."" (that's 40% for those not counting) ... That false allegations are a major problem has been confirmed by several prominent prosecutors, including Linda Fairstein, who heads the New York County District Attorney's Sex Crimes Unit. Fairstein, the author of â€œSexual Violence: Our War Against Rape,â€ says, ""there are about 4,000 reports of rape each year in Manhattan. Of these, about half simply did not happen.""""

You'll only either make yourself upset, or look at her like she's damaged, or both. Refer to item 1, and remember that in this instance: ""ignorance is bliss."" Unless it's her sexual history. She needs to be up-front about that; diseases are nothing to trifle with, ya feel me? * If you get dumped, or do the dumping, SOMEONE, regardless of intention, will get hurt. It is inevitable. Don't stay in a relationship 'cause you don't want to hurt the other person.  * Long-distance relationships are not for everyone. For me, personally, they never work out. Find out whether Long Distance Relationships^© are right for you. * If things don't end up working out: there will be more. Love is nothing like the books say; you don't just love ONE person, and if that doesn't work out, then it's The End. No; it's more, you'll always carry a torch for her, in your heart, but you know that it wouldn't work for [these] reasons. So you move on. You find someone else, and inevitably, your heart will work again; you'll find someone else that will make you feel the same way she made you feel.  * On the topic of ""breaking up"".... if it turns out that, for some reason, it was a crazy break-up and you find out she's a crazy bitch, then learn from it. Keep it in mind when you're looking for love again--because if you meet someone with similar traits as her, who tends to overreact to the same shit she did, then it's probably not gonna work out.

On August 2, 2002, a White House directive issued by its Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) told the FDA, USDA, and EPA to create ways that contamination from ""field tests could be found acceptable.""   * Source: (OSTP 2002. ""Proposed federal actions to update field test requirements for biotechnology derived plants and to establish early food safety assessments for new proteins produced by such plants,"" Notice, Office of Science and Technology Policy, Federal Register,Vol.67, No.149, p. 50578-50580.)   On November 19, 2004, the FDA proposed a ""Guidance for Industry,"" which acting FDA commissioner Lester Crawford described as ""a high priority for the Administration and the industry, to enhance public confidence and avoid product recalls.""   * Source: (Lester M. Crawford, Acting Commissioner of the FDA. Speech before The U.S. Vatican Mission's Conference ""Feeding A Hungry World: The Moral Imperative Of Biotechnology,"" September 2004)  What the new guidance does not do, however, is protect public health. In fact, it does the opposite. If approved, it would increase the chances that the world food supply will suffer dangerous untraceable contamination.  The gist of the new draft guidance is this: A GM crop developer voluntarily provides the FDA with answers to two pages of questions. These may include the results of two superficial tests on their crop that take as little as 20 hours to complete.   If crop contamination is later discovered, companies can claim that they have complied with FDA requirements and the agency can declare that their prior ""evaluation"" shows that the contamination will not cause harm. Armed with what appears to be a legal defense, companies would become less likely to spend the money needed to prevent contamination.",™

t5_2t7no,chrisdancy,1346116765," I'm 43.  I've been in IT my whole life.  Six years ago I started speaking at (IT Conferences) about, IT ""stuff"".  I quickly got bored with telling people what they should have known already.  I started getting involved and following interesting people in social media; twitter mainly, a little facebook, a bit of youtube.  Over the past two years, I have shifted my topics to be more ""futurist""   I combine ideas I read about into concepts that I see today and then just ""imagine"" the middle ground.  Here are some lame powerpoints http://www.slideshare.net/chrisdancy    I usually use a lot of media in them.  I read a lot of crap in reddit and twitter about the social media.  I have been called a ""social media guru"" and  ""futurist"".  I don't think I'm either, I think I'm a good storyteller and an average public speaker.  I can share with you my journey to average joe, that gets to go to a lot of countries and speak about the future, I just returned from Australia where I did a keynote with a dude named “Ross Dawson” who I’m pretty sure is a “futurist”.  You are already doing the hard part, keeping up to date and reading.  Next keep your research (articles, blogs, videos) in evernote or some tool.  Tag them so you can get to them quick. Heck I even use pinterest for fun future videos http://pinterest.com/chrisdancy/video-of-it-future/  Next think up some WILD things you want to speak about and create a description and title, here are mine http://www.servicesphere.com/blog/2012/7/11/roadmaps-for-yesterday-the-2013-conference-season.html  I do this 12 months out so I can start saving the information I need for the presentation, I know nothing about.  Then submit to speak at local meetups, conferences or any event that will let you in!  Grow into who you are, and tie each presentation into your own experiences.  If you are lucky, someone will say, “Hey, you’re like a futurist”  At that point it’s done, you are a futurist.  Oh, one more thing, in the future, you are a futurist, I know this because I’m from the future ☺  Good luck. ",☺

Not sure about the TV (I don't watch much), but I've DEFINITELY noticed that if I sit too long on the laptop (I develop software) or reading a book — I don't know if it's just the sitting or the sitting and looking at something up close — that can make an anxiety attack start coming on. (And by then it's too late for a walk or change of pace to do much good; I've got to set a timer or something.)  I use L-Theanine; it doesn't do much for me, except the actual doing of it (pouring powder in my gums, letting it dissolve... lol, trying not to choke on the ""dust""). But maybe because I'm really used to benzos.  I don't have ""fears"", really. (Or if I do, they're real.) But I do procrastinate on some things. I usually get them done at the very last minute. That's a huge source of anxiety for me, even though I know I make my own problems. (I have a mental block with certain things: I stare at it and can't do it if it deals with my parents.

t5_2cneq,ropers,1346158950,"""Nazis"" is a possibly even more interesting word, because for various reasons, and not undeservedly, the term has come to symbolize ""the epitome of an unquestionably, undeniably evil group"". The implicit supreme outrage against Nazis is of course entirely justified, and having a collective term for ""a group of humans that all reasonable people agree upon is the ultimate in *Evil™*"" is certainly linguistically useful. However, use of the term brings its own dangers.   For one, there is an inflationary effect. McDonald's forget the cheese on my McDouble and wouldn't give me another one after I had eaten it anyway? They're fucking fast food Nazis, I'll tell ya! This inflationary use of the term belittles, trivialises and misleads, because what becomes a byword for just about damn near anything becomes a byword for nothing.   The other problem is that it's all too easy to pretend that some time in 1933, Evil Hellish Nazis somehow magically appeared and then proceeded to bludgeon, pillage and most of all murder with industrial efficiency, only to vanish into thin air twelve years later. It is not useful to forget that Nazis were also quite ordinary humans (just like their victims), and mythologising them by putting them on an ""ultimate evil"" pedestal invites such forgetfulness.

t5_2qh8e,J-Factor,1346161865,"Your link goes on to state that not all emotional appeals are fallacies:  &gt;So, one distinction between relevant and fallacious appeals to emotion is based on the distinction between arguments which aim to motivate us to action, and those which are intended to convince us to believe something. Appeals to emotion are always fallacious when intended to influence our beliefs, but they are sometimes reasonable when they aim to motivate us to act.  For example (from Wikipedia):  &gt;""Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, look at this miserable man, in a wheelchair, unable to use his legs. Could such a man really be guilty of embezzlement?""  The fact that man is in the wheelchair has no relation to their potential embezzlement.  Now, how would you define the emotional appeal in 'Go Back...'? It shows the plight of detainees in detention centers and the war-torn reality of the countries they're fleeing. These topics are clearly relevant to the border protection debate. The act of relaxing border protection laws would have a direct effect on the detainees and future asylum seekers from these countries. So I ask, where is the fallacy in their argument?  Claiming that empathy 'weakens us' seems awfully callous. Empathy is a fundamental part of humanity and border protection is a very human issue. Do you feel the same way about other laws that have no purely 'logical' grounding, but exist just because it's The Right Thing To Do™?",™

The adrenaline from almost dying creates an extreme, instantaneous chemical reaction, that is actually sparked by the internal combustion engine within the bike itself (note: a BMX bike can be used, but the backflip has to be performed through a flaming hoop). Make sure you apply enough, as too small of an amount will be insufficient to cause a reaction. Ideally, time should actually slow to a crawl while midair, in order for the chemicals to have enough time to mix.   Please note that a backflip must be performed, not a front flip, because the bike must be brought into the ""axe nebula""™ created from the can at the specific angle.

Edit: Also - Pam and Jim are supposed to go through a rough time in the last season.  I read all of this on this article which I cannot find right now, but I think it would be kind of interesting.  My guess is that Dwight saw Karen in Jim's bed when they went to Tallahassee, even if Jim tried to kick her out from sex 100 times - and Pam misinterprets this information.  After seeing a good 50(?) hours of footage, I can say that the show is turning out good.  Especially where it left off now with Oscar and the gay senator.  The couples I predict/would like to see: Erin and Andy, Pam and Jim (obviously), Angela and Dwight, Oscar and Senator Robert Lipton, Kevin and Meredith (it was hinted he hit on her season 8), Michael and Holly (duh), Phyllis and Bob Vance, Vance Refrigeration©, Robert and that weird girl.  I have really high hopes for this season.    Also - at the end of the pilot episode, (the first episode) the main theme starting playing as the background music of a scene.  That would be awesome for the last episode.  Also, we're supposed to find out who does the documentary, and who the Scranton Strangler is, and all ""questions we have will be answered.""

All politicians fall all over themselves to show how much they care about [Hard Working American Families™](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardworking_families). This ticket would like to gut programs that help the middle class and poor in order to ever so slightly increase the wealth of the extremely rich.      From 1970 to 2012, median household income increased at one-tenth the rate it did from 1949-1979. 80% of all income growth from 1980 to 2005 went to the top 1% of wage earners. In 1954 the marginal tax rate on the top bracket was 91%, in 1964 it was 77%, in 1982 it was 50%, under Reagan it fell to 28%, and it's now 35%.     **[The top 1% holds about 35% of the nation's wealth. The top 5% holds nearly two-thirds.](http://www2.ucsc.edu/whorulesamerica/power/wealth.html)**   **[The bottom 50% holds only 1.1% of the nation's wealth [PDF]](http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL33433.pdf)**. So you could move less than a thirtieth of the wealth from the top 1% to the bottom 50% and the bottom 50% would become twice as wealthy. Wealth distribution in this country is insane, and the Republicans want to make it insaner.    On economic issues, the Republican party serves the interests of the super wealthy and no one else. By wealthy, I don't mean comfortably upper middle class, million dollar home, double six figure household income wealthy. I mean [greater than 8.4 million](http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/17/measuring-the-top-1-by-wealth-not-income/) in net worth wealthy. Not doctor wealthy or successful small business owner wealthy, but tycoon wealthy, million dollar yacht wealthy. Now of course the Republicans need to have a pitch as to how serving the interests of the wealthy actually serves everyone's interests, and of course [that pitch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply-side_economics) is bogus.    &gt;ability over celebrity     Another platitude.     &gt;pragmatism over idealism     And another empty platitude said by every politician ever.     It's the same old game from the Republicans. On money issues, serve the wealthy elite at the expense of everyone else, play up the trickle-down angle, and be sure to brand the GOP as the party of God and Country - the party of all real freedom-loving god-fearing patriotic Americans - in order to get rural and/or middle/working class whites to go along with a party that pisses on their economic interests from great height.

t5_2rww2,hannahpsmith,1346262267,"For liquid foundation I really really like Urban Decay's Naked Skin foundation. I haven't been able to wear it too much because it's been way to hot and I work a job where I sweat a lot but the few times I have worn it since it came out I've found the medium coverage is just what I need (I have an anxious habit of picking at my face and it covers all the little damage spots that sometimes get left behind).  In powder foundation I like Studio Gear's Dual Identity Wet/Dry foundation and Too Faced's Amazing Face Powder Foundation. I would definitely suggest moisturizing before putting either of these on though I find if I skip moisturizing before Too Faced it isn't AS big of a deal. Studio Gear kind of dries out on me before the end of the day. But other wise I think they both have great staying power.  And I use Tarte's Amooth Operator™ Amazonian Clay Waterproof Concealer. It's creamy so I find it easier to use than say theBalm's Time Balm concealer (which I just don't like).  I know you didn't ask about primers but I figured I'd suggest some anyway. I've used Urban Decay's Pore Perfecting Primer and Brightening Primer and they are both fantastic. I like theBalm's prime, Tarte's Perfecting Primer and Brightening Primer, and Smashbox's Photo Finish Primer in Adjust. However, theBalm's primer, Tarte's Perfecting Primer and the Smashbox Primer are all silicone based so if you have acne prone skin you will probably have to deal with breakouts due to the silicone.

t5_2qh5b,saijanai,1346293585,"Of course.   One interesting tension is between TM-the-non-religion and TM-the-Belief-System:  The most Hardcore Believers™ naturally rise to the top in any organization, especially an organization with, well, ""non-mainstream ideas"" that are formally codified in some way.  The TM organization exemplifies this process quite nicely.  However, because they claim non-religion status, they give up many of the legal and social protections that religions enjoy against being ostracized for being totally off-the-wall. Currently, the Department of Defense and the Office of Veterans Affairs are conducting independent research on the efficacy of TM and other meditation practices in treating and preventing PTSD. The TM organization has to maintain both external behavior AND internal behavior that is sufficiently mainstream to not automatically prevent governmental agencies from using their services.  It will be interesting to see what happens in the next few years as the research is published and evaluated (I'm assuming that despite their believer status, the in-house TM researchers haven't deliberately fudged data so that the results of various meta-analyses that have been published comparing the effects of TM and other meditation techniques like mindfulness will be confirmed in the US government-run studies).  Same thing applies to the world peace projects. The TM organization has to maintain a certain standard of behavior in all TM projects or they lose a potential customer which could double the number of people taught TM worldwide within a few years if the research turns out as they expect it will.

t5_2qhh9,jeannaimard,1346295667,"&gt; Avec la souverainté du Québec arrivera la disparition lente mais présente de la langue anglaise.   Avec 330 millions de locuteurs tout autour du Québec, la langue anglaise ne disparaîtra jamais du Québec. Elle ne deviendra même pas folklorique!!!  &gt; L'anglais deviendra encore plus minoritaire qu'aujourd'hui grâce aux lois telles que la Loi 101 et les immigrants préfèrent apprendre l'anglais comme deuxième langue que le français car c'est plus utile à apprendre grâce au fait que c'est la langue universelle, donc c'est plus facile communiquer à l'international avec l'anglais que le français.   Dans un Québec souverain, il n’y aura absolument plus aucune ambigûité sur le fait que le Québec est indubitablement français.  Évidemment, certains voudront apprendre le rosbif, mais c’est leur affaire.  &gt; Donc, avec la souverainté du Québec arrivera surement une grande baisse de nombre d'immigrants par année.  Et bien, voilà du gratiné: en vlà un qui s’imagine que les immigrants ne viennent ici que pour apprendre le rosbif…  J’ai déjà vu des opinions chtarbées, mais là, on frappe des sommets…  &gt; Pour ce qui est des immigrants qui habitent déjà le Québec, il y a un grand nombre qui partireront avec la souverainté, justement à cause du fait qu'ils parlent surtout l'anglais.  Et bien bon débarras! Ça fera ça de moins pour pousser les immigrants à s’angliciser.  &gt; De même que le français est une très belle langue, c'est un fait que c'est plus utile apprendre l'anglais.   Mais c’est utile aussi de parler le chinois, de tricoter du Phentex®, de faire des grilled-cheese sans que ça colle à la poële, de rouler à vélo, de fourbir un vase, de dévisser un clou, d’arroser les fleurs, de changer son poisson d’eau, de lire un livre de Marcel Aymé, de se limer les ongles, d’effoirer un maringouin, de faire de la confiture de gadelles, de laver les vitres, de chauffer sa maison, de faire du vélo, d’aller voir un film, de marcher dans le parc ou de traire une vache.  &gt; Idéalement, l'on devrait être capable de parler au moins les deux langues, par contre certaines personnes, d'ailleurs les immigrants, n'ont pas l'option d'apprendre les deux, alors ils apprenent l'anglais, ce qui fait que si jamais le Québec devenait un pays séparé du Canada, plusieurs immigrants ne pourront y plus vivre facilement et conséquemment déménageront.

t5_2qpp6,SadCritters,1346332058,"There's this weird thing called mining efficency.   It's pretty important.  ""Muy importante"" one might say.  I understand that in Platinum they don't really worry about that kind of stuff---But getting your natural is pretty important as a Zerg player ( Or any base. ).  Playing one base versus a two-base Protoss is pretty bad.  Like I said---I would willingly test your theory. I'll be Protoss. I'll block you in. 'Then I'll watch you starve or sit eons behind me. It'll be cute~. ♥ ( Because I like to watch people struggle. )  Spending 450 minerals to block a 300 mineral building isn't that bad, considering it then forces a 300 mineral+expense to stop said block, and place a ""macro hatchery"" instead of an actual base.  Not making Zerglings in the early game is entirely forfeit, considering you are doing ZERO damage to the Protoss player until you actually get your natural at least started ( which assumes you've placed a macro hatchery. ). This means the Zerg won't be that far ahead in Drones, because the Protoss player will be running off of two chronoboosting Nexus' to get two fully saturated bases around the same time. As soon as they wall you in, they can pick up Probe production and a Nexus, not have to worry about making units---Since you won't be attacking them for a while, and place late cannons at their base.  I find it laughable that you feel like no damage is done to the Zerg and that it doesn't put them behind.  ( I'm not sure if you know this, but you usually have to kill all three Pylons THEN the cannon. The Queens can't reach the Cannon without being hit as 5&lt;7. The Spine Crawler can't reach the cannon, usually, from the top of the ramp because any smart Protoss will place it behind the third Pylon. This requires you to kill ALL THREE Pylons THEN the cannon while taking your natural at the same time. Do you understand how long that takes in-game for two Queens and a Spine Crawler to do?)  TL;DR: You're wrong and I'd love to test it with you. I'm a Master's Protoss and Zerg and would loveeeeee to see what you're saying work~. ♥",♥

It forces nothing, because you'd make the Queens and spine anyways. How can you not understand that? When it was overpowered it forced Roaches because Queens couldn't attack from high-ground.  Do you not understand what the concept of sunk cost is?  It is mathematically impossible for the Protoss to come out ahead if the Zerg responds well. I don't care what you think, you're objectively wrong. Zerg simply makes Drones faster than Protoss can possibly make Probes, especially after delaying production long enough to drop 3 Pylons.  &gt;The Queens can't reach the Cannon without being hit as 5&lt;7  And high ground &gt; low ground. The cannon can't see the Queens.  &gt;Do you understand how long that takes in-game for two Queens and a Spine Crawler to do?)

t5_2qxih,dulfy,1346364168,"Terror from Beyond is a new Operation that takes us to Asation, a remote planet in the Gree Enclave. Asation is a swampy, wetland world that was terraformed by the Gree thousands of years ago. It is not a Gree homeworld, but it does house some incredible technology assembled long ago by the Gree crafter caste. Key among this technology is the Hypergate, a massive device capable of transmitting matter from across the galaxy. The Dread Masters have sown chaos on Asation by activating the Hypergate, letting through untold horrors and monstrosities. It’s up to players to cut a path through these creatures, defeat the agents of the Dread Masters, and deactivate the Hypergate at any cost.   Terror from Beyond offers five new major boss encounters that will challenge even the most highly-coordinated groups of players. In keeping with previous Operations, Terror from Beyond includes one “puzzle” encounter that really steps outside of the bounds of what you normally see in a boss fight. To defeat this new enemy, players will need to work together to repair a massive, ancient Gree computer from within the machine itself. Unlike previous puzzle encounters where the solutions were relatively easy to figure out, this one has players leveraging their particular group composition to control a chaotic situation. It’s very different from the things that we’ve done in the past, and I’m excited to see what players think.  In addition to strange creatures and agents of the Dread Masters, players will run into a familiar face on Asation. No spoilers, but here’s a hint: he’s not going to be very happy to see you.  The final encounter in Terror from Beyond pits players against a creature of unprecedented scale in Star Wars™: The Old Republic™. It’s easily the most visually striking encounter we’ve ever built. In Explosive Conflict, we took a gauntlet-style approach to the final boss, which worked very well in the context of a military operation. This is totally different. You get to fight something that is huge and otherworldly. The difficulty is highly execution-based, and the mechanics are very positional and fun.  This Operation introduces the next tier of progression in Star Wars: The Old Republic, including a new set of PvE gear. The hard difficulty mode for Terror From Beyond is balanced for players wearing a full set of Campaign gear, which can be acquired from Operation: Explosive Conflict. Augments will become increasingly more important the deeper you get into Terror from Beyond. Story mode will be available for players who just want to see the sights, but it’s no walk in the park.

Retire a harness immediately if:  ♦ There is any kind of rip or hole in the webbing.  ♦ The webbing is burnt, singed, or melted.  ♦ There are any torn threads, or heavy abrasion to the webbing.  ♦ Bar tacks are abraded or showing wear.  ♦ One of the buckles is cracked, corroded, has a burr, or is damaged or deformed in any way.  ♦ The webbing is faded from exposure to ultraviolet light.  If a harness has been involved in a severe fall, but is not obviously damaged, it still may be ready for retirement. If you have any doubts about the dependability of your harness, retire it and get a new one.  Anytime you retire a piece of gear, destroy it to prevent future use.""  Nothing about the nylons failure potential over time if the harness has no physical damage and or exposure to U/V, moisture or corrosive chemicals.",♦

With the Mortar and the Fire Bellows equipped, he travels to Burstone Quarry, the Cael's source of energy-providing minerals.  He makes his way through the area mostly without getting himself into any real danger. Through a maze of switches and moving walls, he passes through the quarry and defeats Sir Lunky, the oldest and biggest of all Lunkheads. After getting rid of the beast, he unexpectedly faces Zulf, who warns him about the impending doom for the Bastion. Nonetheless, he grabs the Shard and returns to the Bastion.  Meanwhile, the Ura have invaded the Bastion. The pets try to defend it, but without Kid's help they'd be powerless. Beef manages to kill all the Ura, but his pet Pecker has fallen in battle. Rucks reveals the origin of the Calamity: the huge catastrophe that destroyed most of the continent was Caelondia's doing. They had intended to wipe the Ura out. No wonder Zulf was furious after learning about this. The Bastion is in rough shape, but the Shard can heal a lot of the damage. Rucks says that the only thing that's missing now is the last Shard to finish the task and restore the Bastion.  Now the Ura also have their eyes set on finding the last Shard to prevent the kid from getting it. Worse yet, it is located at Urzendra Gate, the main entrance to the Ura's domain. Will Beef manage to get there quicker than them anyway?  **My take:**  I was mentioned! \*swoon\*  In all seriousness though, I get the feeling that Beef has found his weapon combination. He just blew through everything with an ease that I have rarely seen in a first-time player of *Bastion*. The funny thing is that every Bastion player develops a favorite weapon combination (I'm more of a Hammer/""Something Wrong"" guy), and everyone is confident that their weapon combination is the best -- but if you talk to another Bastion player about it, theirs is bound to be completely different from yours. For me, this was the first time seeing the Bellows/Mortar combination played to its full potential.  We just saw the second turning point in the story, and the first big reveal. It was the Cael who caused the Calamity, and not by accident but intentionally (though something appears to have gone wrong). That's a pretty big deal. Assuming Zulf has told his countrymen, they can't be happy about it. I'm stoked to see Beef's adventures past Urzendra Gate.  **Tidbits:**  In Burstone Quarry, we learn that the Cores and the Shards belong to the same kind of extraordinary minerals, deriving their powers from microscopic windbags that live inside them. Apparently they record everything that goes on around them, too. A relation between that property and the Bastion's theme of *restoring what used to be* seems likely, and will be elaborated on at a later point. (Yes, the game has quite a few surprises in store still.)  Before this explanation for the Cores' power, we had to presume them to be *Magic™*. The artifacts, especially the City Crest that the Kid is wearing on his back, seemed much more symbolic. The City Crest symbolizes the Star of Caelondia, it stands for the City, so it would make some kind of sense that it would have the symbolic power to bring parts of the City back to its former glory. Likewise, if the Cores contain the ""essence"" of an area, it makes sense that the area would crumble after the Core is removed. That ""essence"" would be added to the Bastion, where it would be used to create more land. We know now that the Cores literally remember stuff, because sentient beings live in them. I'm not sure how I feel about this and if I didn't like them better when their internals were more mysterious. [Parallels to Star Wars](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Midi-chlorian) come to mind.  All enemies that Beef has encountered so far immediately despawned after death. Gasfellas dissolve into air, Squirts explode, some others simply vanish. The Ura soldiers are the first (and only) enemy in the game that leave corpses behind that linger lifelessly on the ground for a while. This serves to point out that, no matter how you feel about killing Beasts and Windbags, *you are killing actual people now*.  Urzendra Gate is the gateway to the Ura stronghold. They were proficient diggers and used to live in a huge tunnel network. In a strange display of the Calamity's twisting of the world, these tunnels have been turned inside out and are now high up in the sky. (I would have told you this next time, but I hope it helps with understanding the upcoming area better. Also, depending on how things go, we might see Beef go venture further past Urzendra Gate next time already, so it's better to know this now.)  **What to look forward to:**  Beef and his favorite weapons in Ura territory? They'd better take him seriously.  Urzendra Gate is a bit unusual in the way it's presented, we'll see how Beef manages with that. Now that we know that the Cael are responsible for the Calamity, expect some more background knowledge and insight by Rucks into how such a situation could arise in the first place, and what Zia's father has to do with all this. The final Shard is within reach. Go Beef!",™

It would seem to me that even if the caps did matter, that it would be probably cost effective to employ a person along the line of people who separate the stuff on the conveyor to grab plastic water/soda bottles with caps and push that end of the bottle into a small-ish set of rotating rubber cones that would spin the cap off.  I'd say not too much risk of a torque injury since it's not tightening the lid but loosening it, then again, I'm sure there'd be a way for someone to get hurt.  They could even just push the capped end into an opening in a cutting machine that would cut the end off.  In fact I'd bet there would be a way to incorporate that into the automation process.  Moot though, knowing now that the myth has been busted.  Especially locally!

t5_2smhl,SenSidethink,1346397431,"&gt;The 3600 damage is based on using DFG on someone with 2.2k HP. That sounds like a fair amount. So, yeah, your AD build that you claimed does ""better"" burst damage... does half the burst damage. That's totally the same damage! (No it's not, you're a fucking idiot.)  You math sucks big time. Around 1100 Damage (Since your combo is around 2500) on 2200 hp would mean 50% flat damage. Good luck finding someone with 0 MR. If i would calulate it this way around my garen can oneshot a tank at 1/4 hp, sure thing.  &gt;And, yes, we're comparing pre-mitigation. Which is better for the AP build, as MR tends to be higher than armor. But I'm even willing to concede that point, to your favor. Your pre-mitigation damage is a shitton less for the AD build. Which, again, you said did better burst! Whoops, you can't do math.  You need DFG and Lichbane to do anything beside double W. I can start with a shitton AD and armorpen and just faceroll people by using Q-W-Q-E then go R-Q-W-Q-E and i got 6 sources of AD damage out + 2x W with lower damage while you just got 6 skills with suckish damage since only your W scales with AP.  &gt;(Trinity Force would give ~160 damage per proc, by the by. So, if you only have one proc which is all you give the Lichbane), your build is up to 2.2k)  2.200 compared to around 2.500 without DFG. DFG got a 60sec cooldown while ALL my autohits still deal a heavy amount of damage since i actually have AD. You burn out your ulti and double-W and then you are left with atleast 6sec of doing nothing waiting for your W to come back or trying to get lichbane procs on them. Means AD deals less burst, but still damage AFTER the burst not only every 60sec.  &gt;And Lichbane does give MR, even if it's not a huge amount. It's similar to Hexdrinker. Because, seriously, what 4 items do you get on Rengar that gives 200 bonus AD and a bunch of tanky stats? Maw + Wriggles + BT isn't very tanky.  200 bonus AD is actually pretty easy. Look at the build they used in the spotlight for example. TF, LW, GA all work extremly good on him and you will still end up with heavy amounts of AD while being able to soak damage up.  ###tl:dr:  - AP does a bit more burst, but extremly less dps with a 60sec cooldown on 1/3 of your complete combo. - AD does nearly the same burst, but higher dps without any 60sec cooldown. - Oh yea.. and your math sucks big time.

t5_2qh3p,intoto,1346406248,"Herpes can grow when there is an excess of arginine in your bloodstream.  That amino acid is a major component in the makeup of the virus.  Arginine is a semi-essential amino acid that you get from a variety of food sources, but generally, things like nuts, grains and seeds have them in abundance.  The body can also make it, but most of the arginine comes from eating foods containing arginine.  The body utilizes arginine and lysine via the same pathway for absorption. If you consume high amounts of arginine, you may become lysine deficient, then excess arginine builds up in the body.  That excess arginine can trigger a herpes outbreak, because the virus can access it and start to replicate.    &gt;Professor Lawrence Corey explains that the herpes virus uses human cells like factories to grow new herpes viruses. When the newly grown viruses are completed, they burst through the cell, killing it. These new viruses are then free to infect new cells and repeat the cycle of infection. However, Corey says, growing each new virus requires 84 proteins, mostly composed of arginine. If arginine runs out, the new viruses cannot be finished. No new viruses means no new symptoms.  Read more: http://www.livestrong.com/article/301800-the-effects-of-arginine-on-herpes/#ixzz257CBZTAW  So, what can you do?  Generally, eat a balanced diet of foods and avoid excessive amounts of foods high in arginine (nuts, grains, seeds, chocolate, berries, onions).  Instead, to avoid herpes outbreaks, you can eat foods that are higher in lysine (yogurt, milk, cheese, butter, meat, apples, pears, figs).  Generally, at the onset of a herpes outbreak, there is often a warning of shooting pain occurring from the nerves that are used by the virus to travel to the surface of the mucous-membrane skin.  When you get that pain, avoid arginine high foods and take lysine supplements.  I recommend taking 1g every 4 to 8 hours.  Often the excess lysine in your system causes your body to utilize all the arginine available, leaving none for the virus to use to replicate.  That can stop an outbreak before it ruptures the skin.  All of this information applies to both HSV-1 and HSV-2.  By watching what you eat, taking lysine supplments when an outbreak starts and until it ends, you can, in many instances, practically eliminate future outbreaks.  You can also minimize the length and severity of outbreaks when they do occur.  Lysine supplementation is not completely risk and side-effect free.    &gt;Supplemental lysine can cause side effects including nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain, gallstones and elevated cholesterol, especially when taken at higher doses.   &gt;People with kidney or liver problems and pregnant or nursing women should not take lysine.   Read more: http://www.livestrong.com/article/474717-arginine-lysine/#ixzz257CTJeZv  &gt;Prescription drugs taken orally, such as acyclovir, famciclovir, or valacyclovir have been developed to effectively treat herpes infections. These medications can be used to alleviate the symptoms of an outbreak and shorten its course or to suppress recurrences, reduce the number outbreaks and prevent spreading the disease. This type of treatment is not curative and can get expensive, especially if it is used daily to suppress outbreaks.  &gt;For HSV-2, try taking monolaurin, a nontoxic, antiviral supplement made from lauric acid (a fatty acid found in breast milk) and glycerin. It is used to treat infections with all strains of the herpes virus along with other viral infections including measles, and HIV, the human immunodeficiency virus that causes AIDS. Monolaurin is believed to have the potential to permanently inactivate the fat coated viruses that cause these diseases by fluidizing the lipids (fats) and phospholipids in their envelopes, leading to the disintegration of viral particles. Monolaurin, sold under the brand name Lauricidin®, comes in the form of mini pellets. Dosage should be individualized, and Dr. Jon J. Kabara, the physician/researcher who developed monolaurin, says that the usual recommended initial dose is 1.5 grams once or twice a day for one or two weeks. The dose can be increased to 3.0 grams once or twice daily thereafter. A maintenance dose can be 3.0 grams two or three times a day. The idea is to start with a low dose and then increase it gradually until you notice a positive response. Take monolaurin only under the supervision of your physician, who can prescribe it, determine your best dosage and monitor your progress.  Herpes is not a death sentence.  It can be managed, and it is possible to stop all outbreaks in many people and for many people to never transmit the virus to their partners because they avoid contact when the active virus is shedding.  Become an expert on the virus, how it works, how it can be defeated.  You will be glad you did.  http://www.sandiegohomeopathy.com/downloads/Lysine_Arginine_Foods.pdf   Another drug that is effective is docosanol, but it doesn't require a prescription, so the medical establishment rarely mentions it, although as a topical treatment it is about as effect as acyclovir.",®

What about the functionality, you might ask?   The ThinkPad ($2100) works wonderfully for my video editing and rendering and the FHD screen is glorious. The specs make this computer perfect for my processing-intensive college program (quad-core i7 3.7GHz, 20GB of RAM... 4GB stock, 16GB from eBay...  NVIDIA® Quadro® K2000M, etc.) material-wise, this thing is a tank. I've already taken the back off (to put RAM in) and the keyboard to check the other pre-installed RAM stick) and it's rock solid. close the laptop and push on where the Apple symbol would be on the thinkpad and there's a slight bend but you can FEEL the amazingness. Extremely solid. If you stepped on this, it probably wouldn't missed a frame of rendering... or if you dropped it, it would stop spinning the HDD until it's safe to turn on again.  The MacBook ($1600'ish) on the other hand is A PIECE OF SHIT. After 1 year, it ceases to work (hinge is extremely loose so it doesn't know when it is closed or open so I have to leave it open. when I or someone else accidentally closes it, I've got to unscrew the bottom to remove the battery and reset it. along with that, it overheats even when not on my lap because Apple doesn't put proper air-circulation in their products. because of the over-heating it now cannot even play YouTube videos at 360p quality without lagging or needing 3 minutes to buffer. material-wise, when it's closed (oh no, take those screws out) and you push down on the Apple symbol, the entire aluminum backing bends and if you push too hard you can hear cracking. not something you want to hear from a $1600 piece of sh... erm...

Here's part of the article.  *A blog and forum community for helping entrepreneurs young at heart better their small businesses. |   916 readers* *Anatomy of a Successful Viral Video* *August 22nd, 2007 by Darius Monsef*  So there was a video post (Trust Me Im A Professional) that hit the front page of Digg.com today, where in a video supposedly shot in 1994 a motivation speaker talks a woman into doing a trust fall where she smacks her head on the floor. The controversy comes from the intro clip to the video that shows what is supposedly the same man, selling his motivation material today, 13 years later…  So how can this guy who knocked a woman out on stage still be a motivational speaker? He isn’t. It is called a viral video. Made specifically to fool you into talking about it.   Notice that there is an eerie resemblance between the [girl who smacks her head in 1994 and a girl in his current promo video…](http://i.imgur.com/xtjZo.jpg)   - Same shoulder length dark curly hair, pulled back over the top with a hair clip. - Same brown jacket &amp; pink undershirt (stage lighting is blowing out the colors)  *You can see there is a black padded mat that she falls on too.  Viral Video Production Tip: If you’re going to shoot all your material in one day… make sure to do wardrobe changes.  How Well Their Viral Video Worked Many people ask why somebody would want to create a viral video like this… Attention. And they’re getting a ton of it.  The video was uploaded to Break.com (Video Link Here) yesterday Aug. 21, 2007. At the time of this post the video has received nearly 500,000 views in just 24 hours. The viral-ness of the video is beginning too… Posts have gone up on Snopes.com, eBaumsWorld.com, and who knows how many people have emailed and IM’d it.  **Why This Video Worked So Well**  - #1 Somebody Gets Hurt We love watching a dad get hit in the nuts by his son’s plastic bat… the skateboarder who doesn’t quite make the full rail slide… we love watching people get hurt.  - #2 Polarize People Some people will notice that something doesn’t sit right with the video and will post their opinions in the comments. Others that think it is real POWNE them by saying how real it is… so goes the comment flame-wars. Watch this for an example of how it usually goes (College Humor: Internet Commenter Meeting). When you split the crowd you get them invested in a side and proving themselves right. It is this conflict that will draw more comments, attention, etc.  - #3 Mullets Scientists still can’t explain why some people still think mullets are cool or why the rest of us can’t help but love them.  - #4 Bring People to Justice - As noted by Philipp Lenssen The â€œletâ€™s pull something to the light to bring them to justiceâ€? factor. It creates a dissonance when we see a fraud working or a crime taking place, and we want to help bring the world towards order again.
