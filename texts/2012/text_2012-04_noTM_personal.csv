Apparently they have made their destruction system so complicated that they can't write a manual on it, so for user convenience they wont release any mod tools at all.  This is of course not the real reason (I ramble), however I remember some DICE dev saying in an interview that ""everything is too complicated for modders to get a grip of"". This is just utter bullshit, though, since the mod community have shown time after time that they actually innovate and piss on the devs when it comes to creating the content for the finished engine.  [Empires mod (Wayback machine)](http://web.archive.org/web/20040401142732/http://www.empiresmod.com/about.html), for example. It let you have a commander (in BF1942), that watched over the battlefield, could place buildings (barracks that people could spawn in, armories that had ammo and health boxes, refineries over geysers to collect resources so you could build more, basic RTS stuff), while the soldiers were actual people playing. It was very buggy and at first, but the head dev back then was a fucking magician with them config files and it got really good and was appreciated by the community. It eventually moved on to the Far Cry engine (for a little while), and is currently on the Half Life 2 engine. I haven't played it in a while, though.  You also have [Galactic Conquest](http://www.moddb.com/mods/battlefield-galactic-conquest) (also for BF1942), which also was a total conversion. To Star Wars, complete with drivable AT-ST (two-legged walker), Millennium Falcon, X-Wing and a lot of other things (although I believe the AT-AT (four-legged walker) was not in the mod). My favorite map was definitely the assault on Hoth (which had a destructible home base for the rebels). Oh, the fun! Ninja edit: This mod also had space battle maps. Death Star also featured.  (Desert Combat needs no introduction since it's almost as known as BF1942, at least if you back up a couple of years)  It's so sad that the developers are forced to lie. The mod tools are not made because modders can't handle the engine. The mod tools are not made because of money. Fucking money. Why would we buy expensive DLC's if there were free mods? And the game franchise would get locked up forever since everyone would ""refuse to buy the sequels"". Idiots. I hate it. Games should be about fun, not about money. Even though money controls everything and it's big boy EA top bosses who decides and they are cigar smoking, whiskey drinking golf players with monocles and the same attitude as [Cornelius Hawthorne](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peZaQ_7GFoU). Well I guess everyone's gotta eat.  Sorry for the wall of text ♥  Edit: While the text might seem hateful/ragey against DICE, it's not meant like that. I love 'em :)",1438,16,0,0,1,1,♥

t5_2qwxl,TheNinja2203,1333359776,"###Easter 2012: Chocatrice vs Evil Chicken  Few rivalries are as fierce as that of the Evil Chicken and the Chocatrice, who are going head-to-crest in an Easter egg hunt most fowl. The Easter Bunny is missing – presumed dead – and the Easter eggs he left lying across RuneScape are the target of the Evil Chicken and Chocotrice’s wicked wager: to find out who can turn the greatest number of adorable little chicks into diabolically delicious snacks!   Report in to the Evil Chicken or the Chocatrice in Varrock square to find out when the next Easter egg hunt is starting. Once you’ve pledged your allegiance to your chosen villain, you’ll be gifted with a patented Eggsterminator®, which will turn the innocent chicks within the eggs into fried chicken drumsticks or chocotreats, depending on whether you have scotch eggs (for the Evil Chicken) or marshmallows (for the Chocotrice) selected in the Combat Styles tab.   Hunts are held on every odd hour (so, 9am BST, 11am BST, 1pm BST etc.) There are 5 eggs to find per hunt, and you have you have a little under 2 hours to find them. You may be able to convince the Evil Chicken or the Chocatrice to set you off in the right direction, but after that it’s down to you and your fellow players to find the rest. Breaking the eggs doesn’t stop other players from finding them, so it might be wise to work with some partners in crime. Join the EvilEggFind or ChocEggFind chat channels to find suitably unscrupulous associates.   If you seek out, hatch and destroy 3 chicks, and then hand the relevant treats to the bad-guy you’re backing, you’ll earn the right to claim an egg or chocolate-themed mask, to show the world your shame (or lack thereof). You’ll need 3 drumsticks for the egg on face mask, or 3 chocotreats for the chocolate egg on face mask.   Get all 5 eggs in a single hunt, and you’ll earn a lamp giving you XP in the skill of your choice. You’ll need to be a member to do this, as at least two of the eggs will always be in members-only areas.   Finally, RuneScape members among you finding all 5 eggs in a total of 3 hunts can claim a permanent version of the Eggsterminator. It’ll be no yolk doing this, but persevere and you’ll wreak eggy ruin across RuneScape for ever more.   Need more help? Join in with the Community team’s clue nights on the 5th, 7th, 9th and 11th of April. Watch our Twitter feed, or head over to the dedicated thread at 10pm (BST) on those days.

For Dillinger, since you have made your presence so dutifully known to CENTCOM's Hasbara Reddit Operations^® , I've put you on a level 6 watch list at the NWO headquarters. We will be watching your every move, your every comment, your every upvote, downvote and submissions in order to determine if we should send a covert CIA heart attack drone to your location.  I've also sent a team out to bug your landlines, your cell phones, GPS on your car and bicycle, and a keylogger on your laptop. Nowhere will you be able to turn that we haven't tracked. We've cloned your family members and replaced them with Mosadd agents (don't worry, they are safe, but have been put in a behavioral re-training facility). We are listening and watching to everything you say. We will attempt to beam mind control radio waves directly into your head. Radio waves so powerful not even tin-foil will stop them. I can assure you, we will eventually control your every thought and move. In Star Trek terms, resistance to our control will be futile. We even put a bug in your toilet to analyze your diet (we must know how you've managed to break free from our mind-control water fluoridation program).   I've also taken over your Facebook account and made the status update ""I've had a change of heart, I love black people, meet my new girlfriend Shantay, she's also Jewish! Shalom everyone!"".

t5_2qhkh,ndt,1333431081,"There's as many ways of doing it as there are people doing it. I did wholesale propagation of less common natives for the nursury trade and reclamation projects for several years and while this is probably excessive for most people who just want to take a couple of cuttings, I've rooted over 150 species of plants, shrubs and trees using this system. Obviously this is not going to work for some plants and other are better done as hardwood cuttings, etc. but this-will-root just-about-anything® including a lot of things that aren't suppose to root from softwood cuttings.  * Sanitize a razor blade, and pane of glass or other sterilizable cutting surface. * Take your cuttings when the stem just starts to harden slightly but is still fresh and limber, not woody. * With the razor cut a clean slice right below a leaf node at a 45 degree angle * Remove the bottom 2-3 sets of leaves and remove the top growing point. You should still have at least 3-4 leaves above ground. * Dip the trimmed portion in rooting hormone, I prefer dry but it doesn't matter. * Push a pencil into the rooting medium (1 part perlite, 1 part vermiculite, 1 part peat moss, a dash of time release fertilizer like ozmocote). Do not push the cutting into the medium as it will remove much of the hormone, drop it in a hole. * When all your cutting are in water it in to settle the medium.  OK, that's all pretty standard but here's the excessive part for most people but makes a huge difference.  * Put the cuttings under misters, in full sun but under shade cloth. The misters should come on for a second or two whenever the leaf surface dries out. That might be once every 10 min or once every 10 hours, it depends on conditions.  Rooting under mist in a high light environment I can get a manzanita cutting to be well rooted and ready to pot up in under two weeks and it's growing like gangbusters right from the start with nary a single cutting lost to rot. In the standard low light, stagnant humid environment like you get with a plastic dome next to a window, it can take twice as long and usually results in a significant number of lost cuttings and many things won't root at all.  Having done both, there is no comparison. ",34621,258,0,0,1,1,®

I am however voyaging toward a career as a screenwriter/author/writer-of-all-trades and have been studying the film industry for quite a while.  You can tell where this is going.  P❤m Wonderful Presents: The Greatest Movie Ever Sold was fascinating to me.  I have a few questions relating to this film.  1.  When you were initially contacting advertisers over the phone you had some difficulty getting any of them to bite.  Do you think this was because documentaries don't draw as large an audience as feature films, the premise of the film itself was unconventional and possibly uncomfortable for a company to get behind, your reputation, or a mix of any or all of these factors/something else.   2.  Do you think it would have been possible to make this film before the success of Super Size Me and other projects?   3.  Do you think it would be better if the U.S. had laws like São Paulo and could not advertise outdoors?  Or do you think that they are important to the aesthetics of our country and provide some of the beauty and cultural identity we have.  I.E. Some advertisements are beautiful but do you think we would be better off focusing artistic expression on art as art, not art as ads; or artistic expression through architecture?   4.

They walk in with their great idea, and want you to sign an NDA just to hear a single word of it. 9 times out of 10 they're pitching the facebook of business or the YouTube of enterprise video or some other blank of blank. They just need you to do all of the hard work in exchange for some small share of the profits.  Here's a hint for all of the idea guys out there. If you have a great idea, and no one else is doing it, it's probably because it's a bad idea. You're not the first person who had that idea, you're probably not the 100th. Great ideas are ideas along the lines of ""an mp3 player that's easy to load music on"" or ""an e-reader with a well known, trusted retailer backing it"". Those are the ideas that make a fortune.

Well, I hung out with my cousin, sister-in-law and nephew this evening, that was nice. * Today was eventful in regards to finding a job. Received the email with the tests I've been waiting for for over a week. Completed 2/4, the other two wouldn't work on my computer, so I emailed technical support. Still waiting on a reply. I also received an email from another agency I'm registered with regarding a possible data entry position. I slept in, so by the time I emailed back they were closed, so I'll have to call in the morning to see if the position is still available. But even if it is, there's pretty much no way for me to work it out. First I'd need to bring ID to the agency, but I don't have ID. No SIN card, license, and an expired passport. Nor do I have a car (obviously), so I'd have to bus there with money I don't have. Then I'd have to bus to the job. =/ I suck. Need to get myself more prepared. * Took a break from French stuff today after yesterday's LEARN ALL THE THINGS French madness. * Going to ask my mom if she can bring me to get my license on Monday. Also if I could pay her back when I *finally* have a job... I don't see her agreeing, but we'll see. * The weather's been pretty crap all week. If I can get up while it's still sunny tomorrow, I'll go outside and just sit. Could use some fresh air. * Brushed my teeth once and flossed once. * No exercise today. Tomorrow, **definitely.** * I helped tidy up the house today, but not my room. * I'll be reading chapter one of The Shack before sleep. I read the foreword on the night of Day One. * Practiced ukulele for maybe 2 hours, spent another 2 hours finding tabs/chords of more songs to learn. * Yeah... It's 5:47AM... &gt;_&gt; * Anyone have any tips on how to boost self-esteem and confidence? Something I could do daily? I guess I'll look that up tomorrow. * I started writing something on the night of Day One... Haven't forgotten about it and I will not be giving up on it. I think if I complete it, it'll be a nice boost to my confidence in myself and my abilities, or might be a push to write more and not give up when I have ideas. * Did a bit... I could do better.

This is configured at the organization level on a per-external organization basis, with one organization relationship in place with each external organization you want to share free/busy information with. This provides the other organization access to your Availability service at the level of detail specified. You can also restrict which internal users' free/busy data is accessible by specifying a security distribution group; only members of that group will have their free/busy data accessible via the organization relationship. Organization relationships are discussed in detail in the ""Organization Relationship"" section of this chapter.   The organization-level prerequisites to enabling two-way free/busy access between organizations are: Both organizations must be running Exchange Server 2010 Client Access servers. Both organizations must have federation trusts created and configured for the SMTP domains of the users who will be accessing free/busy between the organizations. The creation and management of federation trusts is discussed in detail in the ""Federated Trust"" section of this chapter. Both parties must have created and configured an organization relationship with the other organization as discussed in the ""Organization Relationship"" section of this chapter.

The LEDPB10W-40E LED boat light from Magnalight produces 3,440 lumens of bright light while drawing only 40 watts @3.35 amps from a 12 volt electrical system. Four CREE XLamp MC-E® ten watt LEDs producing 860 lumens each are paired with high purity optics to produce a 20 degree spread spot beam approximately 450' long by 75' in width. We also offer floodlight versions with a 40 degree beam spread to provide more light over a larger area nearer the fixture, making flood versions ideal for use as spreader and area lights. These LED light bars are waterproof to 3 meters, sealed against intrusion by dust and dirt and very ruggedly constructed to withstand the demanding conditions found in marine environments.  An integral Pulse Width Modulation controller, high output, low power requirements, high durability and versatile mounting options makes these LED light emitters a superior lighting solution for boats and marine applications where versatility, extreme durability and efficiency is needed.  Heat Management: Heat is the single largest factor in premature LED failure and color shifting. These LED units contain advanced drivers which use pulse width modulation to control heat buildup rather than simple voltage regulators which are typically harsh on sensitive electronics and can contribute to early LED failure. These units automatically sense the temperature of each LED and adjust the energy frequency or ""duty cycle"" accordingly to maintain heat levels within acceptable ranges. This system in essence flashes current at an extremely fast on and off rate to each LED based upon the LED's core temperature. This flash rate is too fast to detect with the human eye, but provides precise control of the current flowing to each LED and thus the heat it generates. This allows the LEDs to be driven at up to 100% capacity without overheating or visible loss of light output. The LEDs are always driven at the same voltage but the duty cycle, however, is changed to alter how long the LEDs are actually on or off. The end result is more light with less heat and longer LED life with an average 70% lumen maintenance after 50,000 hours.  PWM Control: The PWM drivers in these units provide boaters with an extremely versatile lighting option. The pulse width modulation drivers provide the ability to tap into a provided input wire with an external pulse generator and adjust the duty cycle of the current being applied to the LEDs. Thus, you can connect an external dimmer, switch or pulse control and adjust the perceived output of the light, effectively causing the light to flash, dim or brighten to the desired levels. This ability makes these LED fixtures capable of acting as beacons and signal lights as well as all around lighting fixtures.  Additionally, this method of controlling light output results in a corresponding drop in amperage draw, so if the duty cycle is cut back to 50% there will be a matching 50% reduction in amperage draw. These units are also able to monitor and adjust input current to maintain the correct LED voltage levels regardless of input levels across a specific range. These LEDP10W series light bars can operate on current ranging from 9 to 46VDC without any modifications necessary as a result. This ability to sense and adjust input current also provides protection against voltage spikes and drops that can occur in a watecraft's electrical systems which would otherwise result in burning up or premature LED failure without it.

I agree 100% that people drink the kool-aid and totally went balls deep into barefoot/min running and that most of them when talking about forefoot vs heel striking don't know what they're talking about.  Even on this thread we see it.  But the fact of the matter is, you are absolutely correct in that people (and as the defendant claim's, Vibram) did not follow the advice of the exercise science community.  But again, that's the whole point...the science **doesn't know**    Here's the American Podiatric Medical Association's statement on Barefoot running -  &gt;Barefoot running is a possible alternative or training adjunct to running with shoes. While anecdotal evidence and testimonials proliferate on the Internet and in the media about the possible health benefits of barefoot running, research has not yet adequately shed light on the immediate and long term effects of this practice.  So, when Vibram says ""you get all the health benefits of barefoot running combined with our patented Vibram® sole that protects you from elements and obstacles in your path.”  One could infer that there are actually (proven) health benefits to running barefoot.  From Vibram's site -  &gt;The benefits of running barefoot have **long been supported by scientific research**. And there is ample evidence that training without shoes allows you to run faster and farther with fewer injuries. (bolding mine)   That's really the heart of the matter right there because **there is not that scientific evidence**.  Vibrams can try and cover their ass all they want by giving you a plan and telling to start slow and that it might take a year for the adjustment to occur but that's not the point, the point is that, according to Vibram, once you've adapted you'll miraculously have all these ""health benefits"".  /r/triathlon can circlejerk all they want about heel vs forefoot striking but just like Vibram, they can't prove anything, the science just isn't there.

Freedman, PhD,corresponding author Uta Landy, PhD, and Jody Steinauer, MD, MAS The authors are with the Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences and the Bixby Center for Reproductive Health Global, University of California, San Francisco.  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2636458  &gt;**Nontreatment, Delays, and Transport of Patients** &gt;Obstetrician–gynecologists working in Catholic-owned hospitals described cases in which abortion was medically indicated according to their medical judgment but, because of the ethics committee's ruling, it was delayed until either fetal heartbeats ceased or the patient could be transported to another facility. Dr P, from a midwestern, mid-sized city, said that at her Catholic-owned hospital, approval for termination of pregnancy was rare if a fetal heartbeat was present (even in “people who are bleeding, they're all the way dilated, and they're only 17 weeks”) unless “it looks like she's going to die if we don't do it.” In another case, Dr H, from the same Catholic-owned hospital in the Midwest, sent her patient by ambulance 90 miles to the nearest institution where the patient could have an abortion because the ethics committee refused to approve her case.  &gt;&gt;    She was very early, 14 weeks. She came in … and there was a hand sticking out of the cervix. Clearly the membranes had ruptured and she was trying to deliver… . There was a heart rate, and [we called] the ethics committee, and they [said], “Nope, can't do anything.” So we had to send her to [the university hospital]… . You know, these things don't happen that often, but from what I understand it, it's pretty clear. Even if mom is very sick, you know, potentially life threatening, can't do anything.  &gt;In residency, Dr P and Dr H had been taught to perform uterine evacuation or labor induction on patients during inevitable miscarriage whether fetal heart tones were present or not. In their new Catholic-owned hospital environment, such treatment was considered a prohibited abortion by the governing ethics committee because the fetus is still alive and the patient is not yet experiencing “a life-threatening pathology” such as sepsis. Physicians such as Dr H found that in some cases, transporting the patient to another hospital for dilation and curettage (D&amp;C) was quicker and safer than waiting for the fetal heartbeat to stop while trying to stave off infection and excessive blood loss. Dr B, an obstetrician–gynecologist working in an academic medical center, described how a Catholic-owned hospital in her western urban area asked her to accept a patient who was already septic. When she received the request, she recommended that the physician from the Catholic-owned hospital perform a uterine aspiration there and not further risk the health of the woman by delaying her care with the transport.  &gt;&gt;    Because the fetus was still alive, they wouldn't intervene. And she was hemorrhaging, and they called me and wanted to transport her, and I said, “It sounds like she's unstable, and it sounds like you need to take care of her there.” And I was on a recorded line, I reported them as an EMTALA [Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act] violation. And the physician [said], “This isn't something that we can take care of.” And I [said], “Well, if I don't accept her, what are you going to do with her?” [He answered], “We'll put her on a floor [i.e., admit her to a bed in the hospital instead of keeping her in the emergency room]; we'll transfuse her as much as we can, and we'll just wait till the fetus dies.”  &gt;Ultimately, Dr B chose to accept the patient to spare her unnecessary suffering and harm, but she saw this case as a form of “patient dumping,” because the patient was denied treatment and transported while unstable.",20744,607930,0,0,1,1,©

The respiratory requirements of developing embryos likely created selection for brooding, so a thorough understanding of the respiratory morphology of belostomatid eggs could help explain how brooding behaviors facilitate embryonic gas exchange. This study used scanning electron microscopy to document the respiratory microstructure of the eggs of Abedus herberti, a back brooding giant water bug. The exochorion is similar to that of other belostomatids in texture and organization except that the respiratory region is confined to the uppermost quarter of the egg. This is the area exposed to the atmosphere by encumbered males. A plastron network made up of densely packed vertical projections demarcates the boundary between the respiratory and nonrespiratory regions of the chorion. The internal chorion is composed of alternate air-filled and denser layers that likely facilitate the movement of oxygen from the aeropyles at the top of the eggs to the developing embryonic tissues.

Goodbye t.  ok, we've gotten rid of the three most common letters.  the fourth most common letter is the o.  if you got this far you are doing really well!  only two more, and half of all the letters will be hidden!  that's because the six most common letters occur half the time.  letters i and n are next. that wasn't too bad, right?  here are a great couple lines from steve jobs:  ""life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact; that everything around you that you call life was made up by people no smarter than you.  the minute you understand that, you can poke life; you can change it, you can mold it, embrace it, make your mark upon it.""  let's remove some of the mouseover hints, before adding letters.  you probably know a, e, and o pretty well, so no more hints for them.  also, i is pretty easy and looks like an i, so no hints for i now.  you are doing very well if you've gotten this far.  let's do no more t hints. t is everywhere.  if we do no n hints, we can move onto more letters.  this could be a good time to go to memorize.com/dotsies.  or, if you're enjoying just reading this way, that's good also.  s is the next letter. it is an easy one.  it is a sassy shape. see how it sits in the middle.  letter h is after s on the frequency list.  h is harder than s but is higher than i.  did I mention you are doing fantastically well?  only two more, and about three fourths will be dotsies!  r kind of looks like an r, with the hole at the top.  you rarely regret reading an r, or whatever.  d is a dot above the e, of course.  some dudes do good deeds, but deny doing them.  excellent, that takes care of three fourths of letters.  after the next group we'll be at about ninety percent!  now do the first two tables on memorize.com/dotsies.  do the sixth and seventh tables too, since they correspond.  that should help you be comfortable with the first ten letters.  now we can start turning some hints off.  let's remove s because it's so simple.  now so long to h hints for now.  only two more left, and we're at seventy five percent.  r has the hole at the top, so let's remove it.  and d is the single dot, so let's delete its hints.  wow, now three fourths of the letters are dotsies.  that is fantastic! be sure to tell us on twitter.  it is down hill from here.  do the third table on memorize.com/dotsies.  that way we can add the next five all at once.  they are l, c, u, m and w.  ok, so how is this? you're now up to ninety percent!  the last eleven letters are used surprisingly rarely.  the last six are only used two percent of the time.  some have argued they should be removed from the alphabet.  let's see where we are now: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz.  not bad! you are doing splendidly if you're reading this!  reach around to your back and give yourself a good pat.  or maybe even a quick massage.  ok, stop massaging yourself. hints off!  we'll do the next two tables quickly.  once you know most of the letters you can often guess the rest.  now go to memorize.com/dotsies and do the fourth table.  the letters are f, g, y, p and b.  they're off now, but it doesn't look much different, eh?  it's truly down hill now. only one more group after this.  i'm going to turn the hints off in a moment.  are you ready? the letters in that group were so rare anyway.  ok, the hints are off again.  now, onto the very last group!  go to memorize.com/dotsies. and do the last table.  letters v, k, j, x, q and z are now dotsified!  that means every single letter is dotsified and you're a friggin expert :).  if you didn't notice, check out the ""combine"" link on memorize.com.  you can use it to do all the tables at once.  ok, hints are now off for the last group!  this is the full dotsies font without the hints!  you may notice that it's no longer stretched out as well.  the dots are very close to squares.  and here it is a bit smaller. congrats - well done! this makes you one of a pretty select group. chat with us on twitter!  How far did you get? Review on memorize.com/dotsies, or see some of the links above for what to do next.  © Craig Muth 2012  """,36335,611,0,0,0,1,©

Patent-pending construction of 8 fibers (7 HMPE Dyneema® plus 1 Patent Pending GORE® Performance Fiber) and 32 weaves (pics) per inch. GORE® Performance Fibers improve abrasion resistance, increase casting distance &amp; accuracy and reduce line vibration. HMPE Dyneema® fibers provide high strength &amp; sensitivity, hydrophobic water-repellent protection and small diameter.  I've been using fireline for a while now as well, and the feel of this stuff was the first thing I noticed. To me it feels much smoother than fireline. With fireline I could feel the weaves as I ran my fingers down the line, whereas this feels much smoother to the touch. It also behaves differently than fireline... it's hard to describe but to me it was easier to manage/had less line memory.

Here's what I found after a little research:  These terms are related to processor temperature for desktop and mobile systems base on Intel® processors. To allow optimal system operation and long-term reliability, the processor must not exceed the maximum case temperature specifications as defined by the **applicable thermal profile**.  TCASE is the temperature measurement using a thermocouple embedded in the center of the heat spreader. This initial measurement is done at the factory. Post-manufacturing, TCASE is is calibrated by the BIOS, through a reading delivered by a diode between and below the cores. (The temp you reference is the temp measured during production of 66.8C. The reading delivered by the diode, post production is listed as 72.8C)  Tjunction is synonymous with core temperatures, and calculated based on the output from the Digital Thermal Sensor (DTS) using the formula Tjunction = (Tjunction Max – DTS output).    From what I've read, ideally the core temps should be 15-20C below Tj Max (91C according to Real Temp).   Edit: The paragraph is cut and paste from intel site.

I guess maybe it hit in an odd angle and all the weight pressed down on it and the small plastic bit connecting which was around the size of the 3.5mm jack broke now I'd only had the headset for around 4 months and had never fallen or anything like that and considering how sturdy my past headsets had been this struck me as (no offense) crap material or design and after looking online I saw some ppl also found that the quality was lacking.Now I know you've released the HD one and maybe you fixed it but that experience left me with a bad taste. Second might not really be so much on you as it is on how rough I am on with my mice but basically one day it stopped working possibly due to falling so much when I go to my friends and try to untangle cables but I'd had my previous mouse which was razer last over 2 years where as this last 6 1/2 months maybe.Now these might of been isolated incident's but this is what happened to me and I take my knowledge from my experiences but maybe these were freak accidents idk but I hope this was of help besides I really love how you support e-sports , white-ra and the color red :p tl;dr bought 2 pretty pricey items from you.at most lasted 6 months. might of been just bad luck don't listen to only one person and make your own well thought out decisions. again hope I was of help I still love you Thermaltake ♥",1753,1,0,0,1,1,♥

I had my birthday in January, and he had started looking for the ideal gift around Christmas. He had something in his mind that *""I don't have yet, don't know I want yet, but that I will totally love""*. He had the worst of luck finding it: first he couldn't find one for sale because there aren't many of them around, because they never produced a new batch of them and because most collectors want to keep it. Then he found one for sale on Ebay, but was overbid in the last couple of seconds. Search started again, and then he found one, bought it, and had to wait a while for it to be shipped from America to Belgium.   He dropped a few hints:  - You want it, but you don't know you want it (yet).  - You probably don't even know it exists.  - It's brown.  - It has twelve things in it, ten that are similar and two that are different.  - It can, in a way, produce sound - but don't be misguided, if you smash a vase, it produces sound as well.  I was curious, he kept teasing me with it. I have been looking forward to last Saturday for a while and couldn't believe my eyes when I saw it. Apart from some ""extras"" he found (a couple of books with pictures and lyrics), he got me [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Solo_Collection): **Freddie Mercury's entire collection of solo work, combined with two DVDs and other unproduced soundbits and pre-final versions of songs, bundled in a big book with photos and a biography.**   I am really really happy, and since I teased you by letting you know I was getting a gift, I thought I might as well let you know what it was.  ###I am the happiest girl in the world.  Not because of the Freddie Mercury book/collection, but because of the man who gave it to me. ♥",835858,387505,0,0,1,1,♥

Below is the text from his family:   *This past Saturday, a group of us including my bf, best friend and her husband along with her brother, Junior, went camping in the Anza Borrego desert mudcaves. Time flew by and it was Sunday morning, just enough daylight to start exploring the caves. Jr decided to go ahead of us and barefoot, with no flashlight, he managed to get through the pitch black cave until we reached him at the point within the cave of climbing a rope up about 10-15 feet above us to get to a vertical shaft we would have to free climb with help from a rope from up top the mountain. Needless to say I couldn't do it, and my best friend and I walked back to camp through the cave, the same way we came in. By then the boys had already climbed to the top of the mountain, and came down the side of it. Jr was still up above us when we came back through the caves entrance.   Around noon, on Sunday, we began calling out to him to come down the same side the boys had come down earlier, but he insisted on resting his feet. 20mins go by and we begin calling to him again only to get no response. Wondering where he went, Michelle and I walked around to the back side of the mountain where there is a canyon ravine type of land behind it, and we began calling out his name in a panic. Went back to camp and told the boys to go back into the cave to check if he had gone back in because it was hot outside on his bare feet. 45 minutes later the boys reached the top and call down to us that he wasn't in fact in that cave at all, and began to track his movements via footprints atop the mountain (covered in holes, leading down narrow to man-sized shafts, straight into caves) with only enough information to know that he wandered above the mountain but there were no tracks leading down any side.   After searching for almost two hours we immediately drove out of the desert leaving the water tent and a note telling jr we went to get water and food, and we drove as fast as the terrain allowed to the border patrol checkpoint on the highway to inform them of a missing person in our group. Since Sunday afternoon, without water, food, protection, flashlight, sweatshirt, or shoes, junior has been missing. Sheriffs, rangers, border patrol, helicopters, volunteer search and rescue teams, and search dogs have all been searching for him since. These mud caves are extremely unstable and can collapse with pressure, or with rainfall they fill up. Tomorrow is estimated that it should be raining and this terrifies us because we don't know where he could be, and rain would make things 100 times harder to search for him. We are all praying for his safe return and I ask that you please take the time out to pray for him and his family, and if anyone is willing to join the search party please contact me at (PM me for details).

t5_2cneq,wikidd,1334085347,"It's not about hate though; lets ignore the large chunk of people who still engage in hateful bigotry (which happens even here on Reddit). It's about how the legacy of discrimination pervades our culture and discourse, and so cheapens and demeans us all.   I went to a bit of effort to find [this video](http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/the-big-picture/5465-Relics) in my browsing history, so please watch it. It's about racism, but I think the same logic can be extended to other prejudices. Failing to engage critically with ones own behaviour causes one to perpetuate the discrimination. It's not enough to think to yourself ""well gee, women should be free to leave the house and we shouldn't lynch black people, I guess now I'm all liberal!"". As well as changing your ideas, you also have to change your behaviour.  The really annoying thing is that it's not hard to not be a bigoted shitposter, it just requires a bit of empathy and decency. When someone says that they find something offensive and/or discriminatory, don't get defensive and go ""ah! logic proves you wrong!"" or ""well, if I were in your place"". Empathy is about imagining what it's like to be *someone else*. Don't put yourself in their shoes, try to be *them* in their shoes. It's like [bad kerning](http://xkcd.com/1015/): most people don't know about it but it's not hard to understand. When you do though, seeing it done wrong is *really* annoying.  Which brings us back to SRS. SRS does engage in lots of bigoted anti-white male cis straight etc humour. If it's wrong, it's only as wrong as the rest of Reddit. If straight white men were an oppressed minority then Reddit as a whole would be like SRS (without the funky CSS I guess) and SRS would be like Reddit is now.  But hey, at least it's contained within the circlejerk. There's no downvoting, no shitposting invasions or anything that causes a problem for the rest of Reddit. Despite that, it's highly controversial - it seems Reddit taken as a whole doesn't like being made fun of!  tl;dr discrimination is subtle and complicated. I didn't mean to shit so much either, but I think I like wallowing in it with you ♥",7880,1127,0,0,1,1,♥

t5_2qm4e,Cebus_capucinus,1334100124,"I am going to simplify things for you - but in general the Earth's biogeochemical systems are in balance. Meaning the natural cycles of GHG's - [nitrogen cycle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_cycle), [CO2 cycle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_cycle), water cycle, oxygen cycle... are balanced between what is stored (either as plant material, underground, or in water) and what is in the atmosphere (effecting Earth's temperature). Since these natural sources of GHG's are in balance over short time scales (geologically speaking) the Earth's temperature does not fluctuate very much. Over large time scales (hundred of thousands to millions of years) the Earth's temperature does change naturally, but very very slowly. For example: ""The global carbon budget is the balance of the exchanges (incomes and losses) of carbon between the carbon reservoirs or between one specific loop (e.g., atmosphere ↔ biosphere) of the carbon cycle"". This means what is naturally put back into the atmosphere (as proposed by your friend) is naturally reabsorbed by the biosphere - the carbon cycle is in balance - and there is little to no global temperature fluctuation.  Now you add humans to the equation - we are taking stored sources of GHG's (oil, natural gas, coal), burning them and shoving the resulting GHG's into the atmosphere at faster rates then the Earth can naturally reabsorb them. We are contributing more to the 'income' side of the equation and not balancing it with the 'losses' side - and the Earth cannot make up the difference fast enough. It is also important to note that what we are burning is the result of millions and millions of years of stored carbon and we are releasing back into the atmosphere in the span of a 150 years. The Earth's cycling systems cannot keep up - so the atmosphere gets clogged with GHG's resulting in global warming.  Basically we are the problem, this is the scientific consensus. Humans are causing the current observed global warming, not nature.  TL;DR: Your friend is wrong - irregardless if the mariana trench (and by that I assume they mean undersea thermal vents) is a source for greenhouse gases these are natural derived sources offset by re-absorbtion mechanisms that also occur naturally in '[biogeochemical cycles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biogeochemical_cycles)'.

I've really enjoyed it, but I don't think that I have much perspective on how good it is aside from the fact that I was very impressed with the man who sold it to me and taught me to shoot, and I figure his opinion is worth more than mine could be.

t5_2qh6c,IRBMe,1334130534,"&gt; We so often hear that children should not be indoctrinated into religion by teaching in public schools, but it's worth remembering that there's no reason to believe that indoctrination into atheism will be any less harmful.  Yes, it would be awful!  The kids would start the day by praying to Hitchens, before singing Satanic death metal.  Each of the classrooms would have a little model coffin, each with a little Bertrand Russel inside, nailed to the walls and posters of the Flying Spaghetti Monster up everywhere.  There would be a mandatory class dedicated to reading and studying The God Delusion.  Each week, the kids would be taken to the local Sam Harris Worship Building (©) for their periodic Atheist Sermon, where they would listen to quotes from atheist philosophers and sing John Lennon's Imagine - original lyrics, of course.  At the age of 10, they would be required to take part in a confirmation ceremony in which they denounce all religion, take the blasphemy challenge and confirm their atheism.  Eventually, atheists would start to open their own universities and colleges where they can continue their education with an atheist slant. Biology classes would remind students that evolution clearly disproves creationism and physics classes would explain that God is not required to explain the origins of the universe. There would be strict rules and regulations. Any student found with a Bible or a Qu'ran would be severely disciplined.  Eventually atheism would turn into a recognized subject at all universities across the world. Students would study The God Delusion and learn of the much more subtle interpretations than they had learned in school, they would study atheist philosophers, atheist history, arguments for atheism and so on.  More Churches of Sam Harris would spread across the world, but there would be disagreements! The church would fragment into two schools of thought: the Sam Harris denomination and the Hitchens denomination. Further fragmentation would result in the Church of Russel, the Church of Dawkins of the Latter Day Saints, and the Dennettons.  Oh, the humanity! We must stop this atheist indoctrination before it begins! It starts with one student in Bible class saying ""*Well that's stupid*"" and before you know it, you have Dawkins Worshippers knocking on your door early on Sunday mornings and ""*In reason we trust*"" printed on your money.",84647,359,0,0,1,1,©

If we are only dealing with identity as a social construct then it would be possible for two things to have all and only the same (intrinsic) properties but not be identical. It also allows for two objects of the same material constitution and spatial location with respect to us to not be identical because time has passed.   Of course those issues can be alleviated by appealing to what works and what people normally say.

t5_2r4oc,Valkyrja_bc,1334182901,"It really does sound like The Eagles' Brood, third in the series, here's a review of the book:  In the author's The Skystone (1996), set in the last years of the Roman occupation of fifth-century Britain, the sword Excalibur was forged, presaging the reign of King Arthur years later. This time, the narrator, grand-nephew of the forger of the sword, is none other than that (traditionally) eerie being, Merlin the sorcerer--sanitized here to the most high-minded of soldiers who survives wars, betrayal, and a tragic love affair. Caius Merlyn Britannicus, born in a.d. 401, is the son of the Commander in Chief of the forces of the fortress/town of Camulod, a community of Romans and Britons. Merlyn's best friend from boyhood is his cousin Uther Pendragon, a mighty warrior and the son of a Celtic king, though with a terrible temper that can show itself off the fields of war. Torturing Merlyn is the suspicion that it might have been Uther who brutally beat the waif whom Merlyn will name Cassandra after she violently resists Uther's sexual games. The deaf and dumb Cassandra (her real identity will be a surprise) is healed and then secluded, eventually becoming Merlyn's wife until her savage death. There are wars and invasions, waged principally by King Lot of Cornwall, wars that bring awful innovations like poisoned arrows. There are also theological conflicts, since the free-will doctrines of Pelagius are condemned as heretical by the Church. Merlyn's trek to a seminal debate of theologians is marked by skirmishes--he rescues the warrior/bishop Germanus at one point--and by the discovery of a half-brother. All ends with the deaths of those fierce antagonists Lot and Uther, and with Merlyn holding up Uther's baby son by Lot's dead queen, a baby who has ``the deep golden eyes of . . . a mighty bird of prey . . . a King perhaps, to wield Excalibur.'' With plenty of hacking and stabbing, pontifications, dogged sex, and a few anachronistic mind-sets: another dipperful from the fertile Arthurian well, sans magic but brimful of action. -- Copyright ©1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

t5_2qk68,TheLastBoyScout,1334254659,"Im sure others will post some of this too, but I'm just going to run down my list and what I learned playing in the rain.      ♠ Good Rain Gear that breaths... That sounds dumb I know, but being able to control your body temp and not get too hot or too cold is important.      ♠ Gore-Tex (or similar products like Keen-Dry) Shoes help a lot. However, just remember that if water gets over the top of the tongue of the shoe, they will get and stay wet.      ♠ Have a back up of everything.... Clothes, Shoes, Socks, etc. If you get wet be sure to change first thing in between rounds. Fresh, dry clothes, socks, and shoes could be the difference maker. While you are dry and happy, someone is soggy and miserable.      ♠ Bring a large golf umbrella. The bigger the umbrella, the easier it is to keep your bag on your stool and off the wet ground, yet its still small enough to remain under the umbrella and dry while you are putting.      ♠ Bring a really small and compact umbrella. This way, if it looks like rain, but you don't want to carry your golf umbrella, its small enough to fit in your bag out of the way if you do need it.      ♠ Buy a leather chamois. I love these things. They work better than those microfiber towels or synthetic shammys or sham-wows. Leather chamois (or shammys) work best when wet and ring out easily. It will make any disc, no matter how wet it is, dry and grippy. Just be sure to slightly pull and stretch the chamois when it is drying so it remains supple and smooth to the touch. You don't want a rough chamois.      ♠ Bring extra towels and put them in a ziplock bag. This way you have dry towels in the bag if you really need them. If you have a leather chamois, you shouldn't really need them.      ♠ A pair of waterproof socks are a real deal maker. If you cant get Rocky (Gore-Tex) or Seal Skinz (the cheaper version of Gore-Tex), then use this old trick from Scouts: Bring 2 bags that bread comes in and 2 rubber bands to hold the tops of the bags up and to keep water from getting in. I've told people to do this before, and as they told me, they feel dumb when they first put them on, but were so happy at the end of the round when their shoes were wet, but their feet and socks were dry.      ♠ If you struggle with gripping your discs at all, bring some windex in a small spray bottle and put it in your bag. Also, take a wash rag and soak it in windex then put it in a ziplock bag. If you dry your disc off, the wipe it down with the windex rag, and wipe down your hand, you will remove any residual water and oils and have a super tacky grip. This also works well for regular play if you struggle with discs slipping out of your grip.      ♠ Bring an exercise band. Most people really don't want to go out and practice in the rain, so using an exercise band will help you get loose and stay loose. Also, the extra movements will help you warm up if you start to feel a little cold or the temperature drops any. Also, if its raining and you can find a dry spot to stay out of the rain, ask someone to play catch with. Get about 15 feet away and take turns ""putting"" at the other person stomach. Makeshift baskets FTW.      **PRO-TIP:** If your Gore-Tex shoes get wet and you need to dry them, this generally is a big no-no. There is a trick though, you want to hang the shoes up against the inside of the dryer door, and let the shoe laces hang over the top. This way when you shut the dryer door, the shoes stay up against the door and don't make a huge banging racket. Now, you only want to dry the shoes until they are slightly damp. The Gore-Tex material will actually start to degrade in heat, so you just want them to get to where they are nice and steamy, and almost dry. This amount of heat will allow the Gore-Tex material to shrink just enough to restore any waterproofness. This means if you have a pair of Gore-Tex shoes that are leaking, clean them up really well, get them soaking wet inside and out, and then dry them almost all the way. After they finish air drying they should be totally waterproof again. As always, I suggest using a Gore-Tex approved wash to help maintain the Gore-Tex material and as an added protection against water. I learned this from a Rep. for Gore-Tex.",14602,1057,0,0,1,1,♠

t5_2qzb6,huzzy,1334261218,"Somewhat correct.   Love is not *entirely* missing prior to marriage, it usually exists before marriage in most cases.  Granted that before marriage, interactions between man and woman are limited, this love may be weak since the couple have not gotten to know each other that well.    However as time goes on, and if the love is fostered and nurtured properly, it will only grow.   Therefore it is possible that you love someone more after 40 years of marriage than when you first met that person given the fact you've shared a lot of experiences with that person and have gotten to know that person better.    This is a theory of mine that I've been working called, GLUE^©.  It is an acronym for Growing Love Under Expression. Basically it states that love for another person grows as time goes on and you get to know that person better (i.e. ups and downs of life; joys/sorrow; events such starting a family, having children etc.).   It comes with the  tagline: GLUE is what keeps us together.^TM",41238,326,0,0,1,1,©

t5_2qh68,Slappy_MC_Garglenutz,1334262083,"[Here's the pic of the lynx.](http://i.imgur.com/48zMU.jpg)  And a quoted copy of the article:    He weighs in at up to 14 kilograms, but thanks to his enormous feet shaped almost like snowshoes, looks as though he is floating on air as he ambles along the snow.  His legs are long and powerful, his coat is thick and grey, and the patches of fur that frame his face look like the kind of beard sported by aristocrats.  When Trevor Kinley opened up his e-mail earlier this week, he saw the subject heading “A Little Morning Surprise” and the photograph of the majestic beast.  “You can’t help but be struck by how beautiful it is,” says Kinley of the March 28 photograph of the animal known as the Canadian lynx.  “I’ve only had a glimpse of one in the wild, so to capture such a clear image is a rare treat.”  What was an even bigger treat for Kinley, a biologist and road ecologist for Parks Canada, is the precise location for the photograph: the Redearth Creek overpass in Banff National Park, just a few kilometres up the road from the Sunshine Village ski area.  The overpass is one of six that are part of the wildlife-crossing project in Banff National Park.  Combined with 38 underpasses along the stretch of Trans-Canada Highway that cuts through this wildlife-rich area, the intent of the crossings is to keep the number of animal deaths on the highway to an absolute minimum, thus ensuring that nature’s balance is retained.  Started in 1996, the project has included not only the building of animal crossings throughout the park, but also the ongoing monitoring of their effectiveness.  For years, the way researchers kept tabs on usage was through old-fashioned tracking of animal prints. In recent years, motion-sensitive cameras have filled in much more effectively.  “The remote cameras are left there for weeks at a time,” says Kinley.  Every three weeks or so, someone goes in and retrieves the data from the cameras and reviews them.  “Most of the time, we see bears, deer, elk,” he says.  But this time, there it was — a National Geographic-worthy image of the elusive Canadian lynx.  This is partly due, Kinley notes, to the relatively lower numbers of the species in the park. Estimates are only in the dozens for this animal that prefers to roam in high evergreen forests.  The other reason is that the majority of the lynx that call Banff National Park home prefer the environs around Lake Louise, where the latest passes have only recently been ready for use.  “You’ll find more bears east, more lynx west,” Kinley says.  Add to that the fact that lynx have proven to be more wary of the passes than other wildlife — “their learning curve appears to be much higher,” says Kinley — makes for only the most rare of sightings even for those who spend their time tracking animals.  “It was like he was posing for us,” says Tony Clevenger of the March 28 photograph. “It’s like he’s floating on top of the snow — it’s really compelling.”  Like Kinley, Clevenger, who works with the Western Transportation Institute, is also excited about it, but for other reasons.  “Now, we can start to study more closely what they respond to, and look at such factors as crossing dimension and fencing,” says Clevenger, who is one of the world’s foremost roadway ecology experts.  “It is going to be an exciting time for us, to get a much better understanding of this particular animal.”  A research collaboration between Parks Canada and the Miistakis Institute, the monitoring project is one that has caught the attention of conservationists around the world.  Its hefty price tag — wildlife mitigation measures are estimated to account for nearly one-third of the $310-million cost of the Trans-Canada Highway twinning project from Castle Junction to the B.C. border alone — and other aspects of the 15-year project have met with some controversy.  But those in the field say there’s no denying that Banff National Park now serves as a model for effective management of human-wildlife conflict.  Over the past few years, Clevenger has worked with groups in Colorado and Washington state that use the Banff model: “I always call Banff the only laboratory in the world where we can do this research.”  While the successes accumulate, it’s still a rare treat for those devoted to their preservation to see the Canadian lynx is in its grand, natural state.  “I’ve been doing this research for more than 15 years, and that’s probably the best image I’ve seen of a lynx,” says Clevenger. “I’m looking forward to seeing more in the future.”  Valerie Fortney is a Calgary Herald columnist.  vfortney@calgaryherald.com © Copyright (c) The Calgary Herald",20719,28903,0,0,1,1,©

t5_2cneq,ucccft,1334330475,"(CBS News) Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa), the senior Republican on a Senate committee overseeing immigration and visa policy is calling for action following a CBS News report featuring whistleblower Jay Palmer.  Palmer, a principal consultant for Infosys, accuses the tech giant of putting Americans out of work by illegally bringing in foreign workers at lower wages.  ""CBS This Morning"" featured Palmer's story on Thursday.  Now, Grassley is pressing for ""a thorough investigation by the Departments of State and Homeland Security of the B-1 visa program.""  The B-1 visa allows foreign companies to send employees to the U.S. for meetings. But Palmer says Infosys was sending them to the U.S. for jobs.  (Watch John Miller's original report below.) Grassley said, ""If you're bringing them here to work full time and maybe cheaper labor, it's not only against the law, it's immoral and unjustified and unethical.""  Palmer says the practice displaced American workers qualified for the same jobs, but, he charges, it increased profits.  Palmer said, ""For example...if I'm gonna pay you $15,000 a year, why would I pay an American or a legal worker $65,000 a year? It makes no - it's just economics.""  Ron Hira, an expert on immigration and visa policy, told CBS News the problem is bigger than just one company. ""A number of companies, very profitable, large companies that are expanding very rapidly are exploiting loopholes that should be closed,"" he said.  Palmer says after he blew the whistle, Infosys retaliated against him. Now he is suing the company. Infosys categorically denies all of Palmer's allegations, saying they will address the facts in court.  On ""CBS This Morning"" Friday, CBS News senior correspondent John Miller said the State Department has acknowledged that the B-1 visa program needs more oversight because of the potential fraud.  Miller said, ""I think one of the things that has irked Sen. Grassley, is in 2011, the company in this story, and there are others, applied for 4,700 more of these worker visas on the idea that they needed nearly 5,000 people that had skills so specialized that no American computer worker could do them.""  The living conditions of the people who come to the U.S., Miller said, are of concern also to Palmer and fellow Infosys employee Marti Harrington.  ""(They) were appalled by the conditions,"" Miller said. ""These people came in on either these specialized worker visas or visas where you're just allowed to come for a meeting and not supposed to work at all and were stacked three in a motel room. They were in tiny apartments. Jay Palmer actually went out with his own money and bought air mattresses for them to sleep on and a lot of them didn't want to be here. His charge is that this is all about profit.""

Parents say they appreciate the diapers' Grow-With-Me fit, stretchy sides expand and soft overlapping tabs. A mesh liner allows air to reach baby's skin, and an absorbent core wicks moisture away from the surface to promote dryness. The N-size diapers feature an umbilical cord notch to accommodate a newborn's sensitive navel area, and all sizes have a useful wetness indicator (a yellow line that runs down the center of the diaper which turns blue when wet). On the downside, sizes 3 and 4 use Dry Max material and gel; this makes the diapers thinner, but some parents attribute rashes to Dry Max.

t5_2cneq,greengordon,1334336541,"From the paper you cited:  &gt;We found crop yields to be 20% lower in the organic systems, **although input of fertilizer and energy was reduced by 34 to 53% and pesticide input by 97%. Enhanced soil fertility and higher biodiversity found in organic plots may render these systems less dependent on external inputs.**  The factors I emphasized are going to become increasingly important as climate change changes growing conditions.   Here are sample results of some [long-term US studies](http://www.rodaleinstitute.org/fst30years/yields):  * Over the 30 years of the trial, organic corn and soybean yields were equivalent to conventional yields in the tilled systems.  * Wheat yields were the same for organic and conventional systems. (Wheat was only added to the conventional system in 2004). * Organic corn yields were 31% higher than conventional in years of drought. These drought yields are remarkable when compared to genetically engineered “drought tolerant” varieties which saw increases of only 6.7% to 13.3% over conventional (non-drought resistant) varieties. * Corn and soybean crops in the organic systems tolerated much higher levels of weed competition than their conventional counterparts, while producing equivalent yields. This is especially significant given the rise of herbicide-resistant weeds in conventional systems, and speaks to the increased health and productivity of the organic soil (supporting both weeds and crop yields).  * Farmers who cultivated GM varieties earned less money over a 14-year period than those who continued to grow non-GM crops according to a study from the University of Minnesota. * Traditional plant breeding and farming methods have increased yields of major grain crops three to four times more than GM varieties despite huge investments of public and private dollars in biotech research. * There are 197 species of herbicide resistant weeds, many of which can be linked directly back to GM crops, and the list keeps growing. * GM crops have led to an explosion in herbicide-use as resistant crops continue to emerge. In particular, the EPA approved a 20-fold increase in how much glyphosate (Roundup®) residue is allowed in our food in response to escalating concentrations.",76700,7676,0,0,1,1,®

Here's the full post:  &gt;The new Quentin Tarantino movie Django Unchained is set to be released this year and we have now been given the official movie poster for the movie, as well as the official movie synopsis. The Weinstein Company has described Django Unchained as follows:   &gt;Set in the South two years before the Civil War, ""Django Unchained"" stars Academy Award®-winner Jamie Foxx as Django, a slave whose brutal history with his former owners lands him face-to-face with German-born bounty hunter Dr. King Schultz (Academy Award®-winner Christoph Waltz). Schultz is on the trail of the murderous Brittle brothers, and only Django can lead him to his bounty. The unorthodox Schultz acquires Django with a promise to free him upon the capture of the Brittles – dead or alive.    &gt;Success leads Schultz to free Django, though the two men choose not to go their separate ways. Instead, Schultz seeks out the South’s most wanted criminals with Django by his side. Honing vital hunting skills, Django remains focused on one goal: finding and rescuing Broomhilda (Kerry Washington), the wife he lost to the slave trade long ago.  &gt;Django and Schultz’s search ultimately leads them to Calvin Candie (Academy Award®-nominee Leonardo DiCaprio), the proprietor of “Candyland,” an infamous plantation where slaves are groomed by trainer Ace Woody (Kurt Russell) to battle each other for sport. Exploring the compound under false pretenses, Django and Schultz arouse the suspicion of Stephen (Academy Award®-nominee Samuel L. Jackson), Candie's trusted house slave. Their moves are marked, and a treacherous organization closes in on them. If Django and Schultz are to escape with Broomhilda, they must choose between independence and solidarity, between sacrifice and survival...    &gt;Written and directed by Academy Award®-winner Quentin Tarantino, DJANGO UNCHAINED is produced by Stacey Sher, Pilar Savone and Reginald Hudlin. The executive producers are Harvey and Bob Weinstein, Michael Shamberg, Shannon McIntosh, and James Skotchdopole. DJANGO UNCHAINED will be released in the U.S. on December 25, 2012, and internationally by Sony Pictures Releasing International.*       &gt;Django Unchained stars Jamie Foxx, Leonardo DiCaprio, Samuel L Jackson, Kerry Washington, Sacha Baron Cohen and Kurt Russell.

I found a little curl one-liner for polling Google Finance, so I made an AppleScript with it.  This script takes a list of stock symbols separated by spaces as input arguments and queries Google Finance for the price and relative performance compared to the last trading day (delta and percent change).  For example, running the following command in Terminal.app (don’t forget to cd into the same directory as the script):      osascript stockinfo.applescript AAPL IBM INTL MSFT  would generate output like the following:      SYMBOL          PRICE       DELTA       PERCENT     AAPL            605.23     ⬇ 17.54    -2.82%     IBM             202.80     ⬇ 2.52     -1.23%     INTL            20.00      ⬇ 0.03     -0.15%     MSFT            30.81      ⬇ 0.17     −0.53%  There is some basic error handling, too, so if you put in a ticker that it doesn’t recognize you would get results like:      SYMBOL          PRICE       DELTA      PERCENT     FOOBAR          ???         ???        ???

t5_2qhkh,foty8,1334462052,"http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/hs104  Propagation  Leafy Stem Cuttings. This is the most feasible method to propagate large quantities of plants. Leafy stem cuttings may be propagated from the apical 4–6 inches of cane when the cane is succulent but still firm. Application of Rootone® to the cut stem can also improve rooting efficiency. Cuttings should be placed to a depth of 2 inches in a perlite and peat or peat and sand mixture. The cuttings should be misted, especially in the two- to four-week period before the roots are formed. It is important to promote good water drainage.  Root Cuttings. All blackberries can be propagated by root cuttings. This is the fastest method to produce new plants. Cut roots ¼–½ inch in diameter into 6-inch pieces. They can be directly planted in the new location, grown as a potted plant, or placed in a plastic bag in a refrigerator. When planted directly in the field, uneven stands often result during the first year. Potted plants can be grown in the nursery for up to one year. When planted in soil, they should be covered with 2–4 inches of soil. Planting is best accomplished during the winter. Substantial quantities of suitable roots can be had by plowing a furrow and severing the roots adjacent to the mother plant.  Suckering. The easiest and most rapid method to propagate blackberry is to utilize the suckers that naturally form from roots. Simply sever the sucker from the point of attachment with the mother plant and move it to its desired location. Removing suckers has minimal or no impact on the mother plant. Genetically thorny blackberry cultivars will remain thorny and genetically thornless blackberry cultivars will remain thornless whether propagated from stem cuttings, root cuttings, or suckers.  Tip Layering. Semi-erect or trailing blackberries can be propagated by tip layering. Tip layering sometimes occurs in nature and is a viable method for the homeowner to propagate relatively few plants. The technique is to bring first-year vegetative shoots into contact with the ground and cover the shoot under approximately 3 inches of soil. A more efficient method of tip layering is to remove the shoot apex to induce lateral branching. Next, during the summer, dig a 3-inch-deep hole that slopes toward the mother plant and vertically away from the plant. Place the terminal end of the shoot in the hole and cover the shoot with three inches of soil. By the fall, the shoots will have produced roots and the plant can be transplanted.",18,1,0,0,0,1,®

And then defines that it's for non-commercial use only, which further clouds the issue:  &gt; you may use the Service solely for your own non-commercial entertainment purposes by accessing it with a web browser or an authorized, unmodified Game client  And then we find the coup de grace. You may not under any circumstances:  &gt; B. exploit the Service, a Game or any part thereof for any commercial purpose, including without limitation: (a) using the Service at a cyber cafe, computer gaming center or any other commercial establishment without the express written consent of Blizzard, unless otherwise stated in a Game EULA; **(b) communicate or facilitate any commercial advertisement or solicitation**; (c) gather in-game currency, items or resources for sale outside the Game without Blizzard’s authorization; or (d) perform in-game services in exchange for payment outside the Game, e.g., power-leveling;  &gt;**C. use the Service for any “e-sports” or group competition sponsored, promoted or facilitated by any commercial or non-profit entity without Blizzard’s prior written consent;**  This section 2c is what really mandates the tournament license. Emphasis mine. Section 2f echoes the SC2 EULA section 2f:  &gt; F. host, provide or develop matchmaking services for any Game or the Service, or intercept, emulate or redirect the communication protocols used by Blizzard in any way, for any purpose, including without limitation unauthorized play over the Internet, network play, or as part of content aggregation networks;  Section 7 outlines how Blizzard is allow to suspend accounts:  &gt; ACCOUNT SUSPENSION/CANCELATION. BLIZZARD MAY SUSPEND, TERMINATE, MODIFY, OR DELETE ACCOUNTS **AT ANY TIME FOR ANY REASON OR FOR NO REASON**, WITH OR WITHOUT NOTICE TO YOU. Accounts terminated by Blizzard for any type of abuse, including without limitation a violation of these TOU, a Game-specific Terms of Use, or a Game EULA will not be reactivated for any reason.  Section 12b(a) essentially says that you're not allowed to attack their service. I'm not a sysadmin, but if I got a ton of connections from the same IP when I'd normally get only one or two from any specific IP, I'd probably think that something was up.  &gt; (a) institute, assist, or become involved in any type of attack, including without limitation denial of service attacks, upon the Service or otherwise attempt to disrupt the Service or any other person’s use of the Service;   The Battle.net ToU doesn't have [binding arbitration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitration), but SC2 EULA does.  **TL;DR** Blizzard can do anything they want to your access to the game at any time and there's nothing you can do about it without getting lawyers involved, and that'll probably not make Blizzard want to restore your access or ever do business with you again. So, when shit happens, complain to the right people: Blizzard, Reddit, game sites, etc.",20352,16078,0,0,1,0,®

STOP MAKING FUCKING EXCUSES FOR THE THINGS YOU LOVE AND START EXPRESSING THAT YOU LOVE THEM.  I love thinking about deep as fuck game ideas, such as ""A horror game where the enemies sneak up on you and shout Dubstep into your ears""  THIS IS VERY FUNNY.

Not sure if this goes here but I used to play the violin for 5 years when I was younger. Wasn't passionate enough to continue down that road, but it was a great experience.  OK THAT WORKS.  THE REST:  • Want to share songs, movies or games back and forth  YAWN  • Need a gaming partner  OK  • Want to have a discussion about physics, computer science, philosophy or any other of the sciences.  SEE ENDING BELOW  • Have a mind-boggling puzzle that nerd-sniped you and want to join forces in order to solve it  I DON'T KNOW WHAT NERD-SNIPED MEANS, NOBODY ELSE DOES EITHER, AND THIS SUCKS. THROW IT OUT.  • Any question about anything in that huge block of text above  MEH.   Ok final thoughts: I'm going to be cruel here. All the women you want to be dating? They're dating me. And all the other guys who love science and computers and everything you love, except we're fun, because we can express ourselves. The hot nerdy girls STILL WANT a guy who can express his emotions. It's a weird, weird thing, but those women all lunge at the handful of men who aren't wrapped up in their heads. If you unwrap your emotions from their carefully constructed packaging and take them out and play with them and display them to others, WOMEN WILL LOVE YOU. Especially if you can play around and make them laugh. You can do this when you're talking to friends, but jesus, pretend the following: all of your friends don't know you, and the only way they know whether they want to meet you is by reading this profile. Would it work? Or would you change it?  You'd change it. So do so.  Final dirty statement: a lot of girls on okcupid have profiles that, in the absence of pictures, are far more interesting than yours. They express themselves and are interesting. So ""barely work on"" is meaningless. All that matters is how you communicate. So work on that!  There's your book. Now instead of asking for more advice, go fix what's broken. Evolve the damned thing until it works. And yes - smile. ",117792,6372,0,0,0,1,☑

t5_2qh2s,rbrumble,1334519558,"For you then:  ______  From Dragon 127, pg. 3  Tucker’s kobolds  This month’s editorial is about Tucker’s kobolds. We get letters on occasion asking for advice on creating high-level AD&amp;D® game adventures, and Tucker’s kobolds seem to fit the bill.  Many high-level characters have little to do because they’re not challenged. They yawn at tarrasques and must be forcibly kept awake when a lich appears. The DMs involved don’t know what to do, so they stop dealing with the problem and the characters go into Character Limbo. Getting to high level is hard, but doing anything once you get there is worse.  One of the key problems in adventure design lies in creating opponents who can challenge powerful characters. Singular monsters like tarrasques and liches are easy to gang up on; the party can concentrate its firepower on the target until the target falls down dead and wiggles its little feet in the air. Designing monsters more powerful than a tarrasque is self-defeating; if the group kills your super-monster, what will you do next—send in its mother? That didn’t work on Beowulf, and it probably won’t work here.  Worse yet, singular supermonsters rarely have to think. They just use their trusty, predictable claw/claw/bite. This shouldn’t be the measure of a campaign. These games fall apart because there’s no challenge to them, no mental stimulation – no danger.  In all the games that I’ve seen, the worst, most horrible, most awful beyond-comparison opponents ever seen were often weaker than the characters who fought them. They were simply well-armed and intelligent beings who were played by the DM to be utterly ruthless and clever. Tucker’s kobolds were like that.  Tucker ran an incredibly dangerous dungeon in the days I was stationed at Ft. Bragg, N.C. This dungeon had corridors that changed all of your donkeys into huge flaming demons or dropped the whole party into acid baths, but the demons were wienies compared to the kobolds on Level One. These kobolds were just regular kobolds, with 1-4 hp and all that, but they were mean. When I say they were mean, I mean they were bad, Jim. They graduated magna cum laude from the Sauron Institute for the Criminally Vicious.  When I joined the gaming group, some of the PCs had already met Tucker’s kobolds, and they were not eager to repeat the experience. The party leader went over the penciled map of the dungeon and tried to find ways to avoid the little critters, but it was not possible. The group resigned itself to making a run for it through Level One to get to the elevators, where we could go down to Level Ten and fight “okay” monsters like huge flaming demons.  It didn’t work. The kobolds caught us about 60′ into the dungeon and locked the door behind us and barred it. Then they set the corridor on fire, while we were still in it.  “NOOOOOO!!!” screamed the party leader. “It’s THEM! Run!!!”  Thus encouraged, our party scrambled down a side passage, only to be ambushed by more kobolds firing with light crossbows through murder holes in the walls and ceilings. Kobolds with metal armor and shields flung Molotov cocktails at us from the other sides of huge piles of flaming debris, which other kobolds pushed ahead of their formation using long metal poles like broomsticks. There was no mistake about it. These kobolds were bad.  We turned to our group leader for advice.  “AAAAAAGH!!!” he cried, hands clasped over his face to shut out the tactical situation.  We abandoned most of our carried items and donkeys to speed our flight toward the elevators, but we were cut off by kobold snipers who could split-move and fire, ducking back behind stones and corners after launching steel-tipped bolts and arrows, javelins, hand axes, and more flaming oil bottles. We ran into an unexplored section of Level One, taking damage all the time. It was then we discovered that these kobolds had honeycombed the first level with small tunnels to speed their movements. Kobold commandos were everywhere. All of our hirelings died. Most of our henchmen followed. We were next.  I recall we had a 12th-level magic user with us, and we asked him to throw a spell or something. “Blast ‘em!” we yelled as we ran. “Fireball ‘em! Get those little @#+$%*&amp;!!”  “What, in these narrow corridors? ” he yelled back. “You want I should burn us all up instead of them?”  Our panicked flight suddenly took us to a dead-end corridor, where a giant air shaft dropped straight down into unspeakable darkness, far past Level Ten. Here we hastily pounded spikes into the floors and walls, flung ropes over the ledge, and climbed straight down into that unspeakable darkness, because anything we met down there was sure to be better than those kobolds.  We escaped, met some huge flaming demons on Level Ten, and even managed to kill one after about an hour of combat and the lives of half the group. We felt pretty good — but the group leader could not be cheered up.  “We still have to go out the way we came in,” he said as he gloomily prepared to divide up the treasure.  Tucker’s kobolds were the worst things we could imagine. They ate all our donkeys and took our treasure and did everything they could to make us miserable, but they had style and brains and tenacity and courage. We respected them and loved them, sort of, because they were never boring.  If kobolds could do this to a group of PCs from 6th to 12th level, picture what a few orcs and some low level NPCs could do to a 12th-16th level group, or a gang of mid-level NPCs and monsters to groups of up to 20th level. Then give it a try. Sometimes, it’s the little things—used well—that count.  Roger E. Moore ",28597,2045,0,0,0,1,®

t5_2qk68,TheLastBoyScout,1334546955,"Congrats on hitting metal. It always keeps you coming back for more and trying that much harder when things like this happen.    The Blizzard discs for me really don't give me that much more distance around 150 gram weights. The Blizzard Bosses are what I have found to be the most reliable, and around the 130 gram range. However, unless you are in a distance competition, i wouldnt recommend throwing them, as they are very movable and unpredictable at times.    What I throw really depends on a few things and what purpose my disc has for being in the bag.... I throw a mix of Champ and Star for most of my drivers, and typically i try to choose Champion plastic for my Overstable version of a mold, if I can find one with the right qualities that Im looking for, but more on that in a minute.    Well, Let me run down what plastics are and order of durability from most durable to least durable:  **♠** CE/Titanium (CE was just a tough plastic that was resistant to scuffing. Titanium is a polymer blend to add durability)   **♠** Champion/Elite Z   **♠** Star/ESP (a blend of Champion/Elite Z and Pro/Elite X for added grip)   **♠** KC Pro   **♠** Pro/R-Pro/Elite X   **♠** DX/Pro D    Typically, the stiffer the plastic, the more resistant to scuffing it will be, and thus more durable.    Now, one thing that I hear commonly is that Champion plastic is more stable than Star or Pro. While one would assume this is true, its really not if you were to compare the discs as they were brand new.   Lets take a Roc for example. A DX Roc is by and far the most stable Roc you can get off the shelf, but because they break in the quickest people usually tend to go with Champion or Star over the DX. So, for extended durability in the long run, they give up DX which has more glide. If we invert the chart above (reading it from bottom to top) you get a list of discs that have the most glide to the least amount of glide. This is one factor that causes people to believe that a disc is more stable, simply because it didnt go as far. If you were able to throw a DX Roc, a KC Pro Roc, a Star Roc and a Champion Roc (which for the sake of this argument all have the same exact specs, weights, and dimensions and are all from the Rancho mold) on a flat trajectory, you would have to watch how quickly the disc goes from flat and to a hyzer angle to truly measure stability.     Like i said, its all hypothetical since Champion and Star plastics tends to mold up with a thicker wing. This combination of being slightly thicker and having less glide usually means it will be more likely to fade when you need it to, making it more reliable, and thus preferred.    Now one thing that you have to be aware of is that for some reason, and I haven't figured out why nor had anyone else offer me an explanation, certain molds are more stable in Champion plastic than they are in Star and vice versa. Champion Sidewinders are less stable than Star Sidewinders, while Champion Roadrunners are more stable than Star Roadrunners. So knowing what type of plastic works best for the disc you are throwing is important as well. The same thing applies to a Glow disc. The Glow material seems to not only make a stiffer disc, but it tends to mold up flatter. Im guessing something about the glow material allows the disc's flight plate to cool slightly faster than the rim. This causes it to appear flatter, which means its more low speed stable, and the flight plate shrinking first means it pulls the parting line of the disc up higher. Here is a good article that Blake T wrote that gave me the basic ins and outs on what to look for years ago when i first started the game: [http://www.discgolfreview.com/resources/articles/discqualities.shtml](http://www.discgolfreview.com/resources/articles/discqualities.shtml)      The one last piece of advice I can give about looking at a disc before buying it, is something i mentioned about Glow discs and the parting line: [http://i.imgur.com/6vDPw.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/6vDPw.jpg). This is a little thing i put together a few months ago and posted. This will help you find like discs no matter what production run they are from, or what plastic they are in. With how a disc cools affecting how the final product comes out, it can make it very hard to grab discs that fly the same within the same mold and plastic you prefer. Knowing the specific parting line heights and how much of a hook they have will save you lots of time and effort when trying to find backups and replacements. The higher the parting line and the deeper the hook, the more overstable the disc will be regardless of the plastic.  ",14602,1057,0,0,1,1,♠

t5_2rpq5,mikal619,1334574143,"Jeep® is the oldest off-road/sport utility vehicle brand. In 1940 the US Army put out specifications to the automobile industry for a vehicle they wanted for the future. The Army knew that they needed a vehicle that could withstand many different terrains and conditions. The first prototype delivered to the Army was from the American Bantam Car Company which had just brought Karl Probst on board for the project. Two other prototypes were produced by Ford and Willys-Overland. The Army felt that the American Bantam Car Company was too small to supply the number of vehicles needed and it then allowed Ford and Willys-Overland to make attempts on their designs after seeing Bantam's vehicle in working order. Willys-Overland offered the lowest bid and won the initial contract. Willys-Overland now had what would become the standardized jeep design. In early 1941 the company showed the off-road performance by driving it up the steps to the US Capital Building in Washington, DC. They started work building the new MB military vehicles at their plant in Toledo, Ohio. ",0,1,0,0,1,1,®

t5_2qk68,TheLastBoyScout,1334589261,"My Thoughts:      **♠** Dave D's Tip is one of the most important in putting. He is right, everything else is *SECONDARY* to making that quick last second movement.      **♠** Avery's point about putter choice: That it feels good in your hand, and makes you putt with confidence. This game is 95% mental. And 100% of that mental aspect is being *CONFIDENT* in your self and your abilities.      **♠** Avery talks about there being minimal wrist spring. Most people mistake the finger spring for being wrist spring. Wrist spring + finger spring = being off line to the right of your line (assuming RH putting).      **♠** Avery talks about focusing on one link when aiming, or the basket as a whole. I disagree with this. I like what Cam Todd says on this matter. He feels that you should always aim at the pole. Its solid, and its always in the center of the basket regardless where you are. Moving around the basket the location of the chain links always change, so you are never aim in the same exact location, just a general on.      **♠** Jussi's remarks about putting in the wind. Spot on.      **♠** The 3 Points of Putting: **1)** Routine. A good routine will help you overcome many distractions, including pressure situations. If you have made the putt 1000s of times in practice, then making the same putt to win really is no different. It's still the same putt. **2)** Commit and Execute. Another duh moment, but still something people struggle with. As Avery said, you have to be confident in knowing you are making the right choice in your plan of attack. If you aren't feeling it, step off the putt, take a deep breath and fully exhale, then set back up and make the putt. **3)** Practice is almost a given. If you don't put in the time, you'll never see any benefits.         I would say that over all its a decent video. Its mainly for players who have been playing for a while and doesn't go in to as much depth as Dave Feldberg does in some of his videos, but it does make some good points that would benefit any one.",14602,1057,0,0,1,1,♠

Moving around the basket the location of the chain links always change, so you are never aim in the same exact location, just a general on.  My inexperienced logic on the matter, from a purely geometrical standpoint. You have to take in to consideration the degree of variance. Say you have a 10-15 degree variance in your putts, at 10 feet you're off by inches, but by the time you're out to 40 feet, your range of variance is wider than the chains. Taking fade into consideration at that distance; shouldn't you be aiming towards the edge of the chains, or are you just trying to have enough speed on it to keep it from fading?",1405,174,1,0,1,1,♠

Rather than just right-clicking at and selecting ""save image as"", you need to use the download link on the deviantart page. That'll give you a .zip folder with the .bmps inside it. I guess I may as well walk you through the rest, just in case. If you don't already have a rar extractor like winrar or something, I'm pretty sure you'll need to get one of those to get inside that zip folder. If you don't have one just google it and you'll fins one pretty quickly.  In the zip folder there are two other folders which contain different versions of the animation, one of which is stretched for some reason. You'll need to extract one of these (just drag it from the extractor window to your desktop or somewhere in your documents) to use with the [boot updater](http://www.coderforlife.com/projects/win7boot/). Assuming you've downloaded that, just run the .exe  and in the first drop-down in the window, select ""animation"". From there, just find the folder you extracted and the rest should be pretty self-explanatory. ninja edit: you can also change the text on the loading screen to, like, ""loading sburb, ©Crockercorp"" or whatever.

There is no other commandment greater than these.  To define what sexual immorality is, we must first define what immorality is. From what I can tell, that which goes against the commandment to love thy neighbor (or be excellent to each other, as I like to put it) would be immoral. Murder, theft, etc are all things that harm another person. So the question is, would showing such affection harm someone? This is for you to decide, and for her to decide for herself. Paul's epistles should account for social context, though the bottom line is the above, be excellent to each other. Taking what we know about psychology and modern relationships between people, that message may have been worded differently to us.

Bleach + acid = chlorine gas, ~~AKA mustard gas.~~ Derp  &gt;What Happens When Bleach and Vinegar Are Mixed  &gt;Chlorine bleach contains sodium hypochlorite or NaOCl. Because bleach is sodium hypochlorite in water, the sodium hypochlorite in bleach actually exists as hypochlorous acid:  &gt;NaOCl + H2O ↔ HOCl + Na+ + OH-  &gt;Hypochlorous acid is a strong oxidizer. This is what makes it so good at bleaching and disinfection. If you mix bleach with an acid, chlorine gas will be produced. For example, if you mix bleach with toilet bowl cleaner, which contains hydrochloric acid:  &gt;HOCl + HCl ↔ H2O + Cl2  &gt;Chlorine gas attacks mucous membranes, such as your eyes, throat, and lungs and can kill you, so causing that reaction isn't in your best interest. If you mix bleach with another acid, such as the acetic acid found in vinegar, you get essentially the same result:  &gt;2HOCl + 2HAc ↔ Cl2 + 2H2O + 2Ac- (Ac : CH3COO)",124894,18153,0,0,1,1,↔

Dell XPS doesn't get the same performance as the Alienware, until you get to 17 inch computers. That's to be expected since Dell owns Alienware.  Asus doesn't list prices online.

TOSHIBA [QOSMIO](http://www.mytoshiba.com.au/products/computers/qosmio/f750/pqf75a-065024/specifications#details) is above $2000, and has a worse GPU. It's also larger at 15+ inches.

RG mana ramp with Skarner, opponent never does anything.  Sona needs to be 1/1 and the heal needs to be 2.  Viktor's ability to turn cards to Artifacts is quite OP, mana cost of 1 too cheap.  Xerath's 4 mana cost 4 damage + 4 draw is too good. If it was 2 and 2 it would be fine.  Xin and Yorick quite well designed I'd say, though I think Xin ability should be 2 mana. Not too big of a deal though.  God I'd love to have Ziggs in my deck♥  Wow, I used to have a deck that could've abused Zilean so hard.   So yeah, overall, pretty much OP but well thought out.",53244,11026,0,0,1,1,♥

(Besides the perfectly worthy goal of learning, of course)  You might make different choices if your goal is to make money, vs preserve what you have, for example. Perhaps you want to keep half your money very safe and risk the other half trying to get some return. Knowing your goals is extremely important in investing.  What duration are you thinking about? If you might want the money in 1 year, or 5 years, or 10 years, that affects your choices.  In general, the sooner you might want the money, the less risky asset you want. Government insured savings accounts, certificates of deposit, and government (US or Canadian) bonds are less risky, where 1 year CDs and bonds are lower risk (and lower interest rate) than 5 year CDs and bonds.  For some advice, I suggest reading http://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Bogleheads®_investment_philosophy Much if it is targeted towards people saving toward retirement in the US.

Beginning prior to the launch of Diablo III, in order to carry a Battle.net Balance greater than €100 EUR / £80 GBP (or equivalent), players will be required to attach a Battle.net Authenticator or Battle.net Mobile Authenticator to their Battle.net account. In addition, we will be instituting a Battle.net Balance maximum limit of €250 EUR / £200 GBP (or equivalent). We’ll go into more detail about the different options for making purchases in the currency-based auction house prior to launch.   &gt;**Global Play:** When Diablo III presales began, we mentioned as part of the purchase process that Diablo III players would be able to choose to play on game servers based in the Americas, Europe, or Asia, regardless of what region they were connecting from or which language-version of the game they purchased (with certain restrictions). As you’ll see in the updated TOU, the name for this functionality is “Global Play,” and we’ll be providing more information about exactly how it works, including the restrictions noted above, prior to Diablo III’s launch.   &gt;Stay tuned to diablo3.com for further details on the currency-based auction house and Global Play in the coming weeks.

t5_2r0gj,4blockhead,1334894408,"&gt; Do you ever think that the point of all the ""administrative"" stuff is part of a (perhaps unintentional) self-deception? EG; people get so caught up in the details of their after life, and the steps to attain it, that they never stop to see the bigger picture?  I think it definitely keeps people's minds occupied. They don't have to worry about how many wives Joseph Smith had, or why he was marrying other mens wives, or fourteen year old girls if they're busy rereading the Book of Mormon for the forty-second time. The temple is part of providing an endless amount of busy work for those so inclined to engage in. It's a poker game, and they're betting that if they stick it out to the end they'll win, cash in their chips, and be reunited with their dead relatives. *Surely, all of that time isn't wasted.*  &gt; It seems like Mormons may have a better retention rate.  I have already stated and placed my bets on this subreddit- I think that mormonism is going to be drastically reduced due to information being freely available on the internet. When all of the historical facts about Smith's philandering, the false testimony of the witnesses to the Book of Mormon, are widely recognized and common knowledge leaving will become an entirely viable option. Smith is the lynchpin of the religion, and he's a weak peg- even as a martyr. Because mormonism emerged relatively recently it is still possible to debunk its claims using contemporary known sources. If we had any physical evidence, like the golden plates, matching native american DNA, then they would have a claim to being the *one true church.* Without them, the church is an also-ran. Smith's claims are not enough to hold it all together. The [community of christ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_Christ) have found this to be true, too. I predict an exodus similar to what has happened in the Catholic church when the scale of their abuse was exposed.  The mormons have some unique problems, too. The leadership have invested in [a $5 billion downtown shopping mall](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_Creek_Center). That property may become a long term cash sink, and not the cash cow that they had predicted. Brick and mortar retail is a risky proposition, in my opinion. Looking at the fancy shops-- the Brooks Brothers, the Tiffany and Company, the True Religion Jeans^® -- people may actually stop and wonder why they are paying tithing if it is only going to go into maintaining Salt Lake City's high-end shopping district. Some people may actually want their tithing to do things to help the poor. I don't know what the retention rate is for other religions, but I think mormonism has a tough row to hoe ahead of it.",85337,113227,0,0,1,1,®

t5_2qh1i,diannee3,1334910020,"CRASH, bang, clank, clatter! Reveille, I quietly drop from the bunk. If there is a more crass way of doing anything it will shortly make its way into the government’s repertoire of daily behaviors. I leave the 33 gallon, galvanized steel garbage can clattering between the bunks for someone else to retrieve as I make my way to the showers. I dress carefully in the pants and shirt I’ve folded and pressed under my mattress and take pains to securely pin up my long hair. Never give them an excuse! Make up my bunk ship shape. I’m ready for whatever they throw at me.   At seventeen I’m here to make my escape. As bad as everyone else thinks this is, it’s a cakewalk compared to what I’ve been living. As rude, crass, crude and demanding as they are here, it’s impersonal. They can’t touch my emotions because I have no attachments, and they can’t touch me physically unless I start it. Freedom!   Standing in company formation waiting our turn in the mess hall, “They” inform us of the new rules. Male and female companies will now be segregated for meals and classes. It takes longer to get breakfast this morning because of the new routine. There’s lots of grumbling and complaining about this new insult being heaped upon us, but what are we to do? We’re just a bunch of powerless recruits stuck in a hopeless situation called boot camp.   I finally get my turn at green eggs and Kellogg’s Raisin Bran with no raisins. I used to think “green eggs” was just a nursery rhyme, now I know that if you make up dehydrated eggs in advance and leave them sit long enough before you cook them, they will turn a beautiful shade of snot green. The Raisin Bran? I don’t know. I think they must buy the stuff that failed quality control and serve that to the recruits. Whatever… it’s breakfast of a sort.   I have 20 minutes to eat, drink coffee and warm up. The Master at Arms is the only one allowed to wear a watch; and so I keep a close eye on her, making sure I leave the chow hall before she does. When she returns the Master at Arms stands at the door to the barracks and writes up any one returning from mess after her. They are AWOL. Absent WithOut Leave is just a step shy of desertion; it’s about the worst thing you can be accused of in the Navy without actually doing anything. Of course it goes without saying that if you’re accused by the government then you obviously are guilty. “What do you mean innocent until proven guilty? You’re in the Navy now! You have a right to one hour sleep, one meal per day, not necessarily hot and pay if congress has authorized it! That is correct recruit; you gave up your rights when you decided to protect everyone else’s.”   I spend most of the morning pondering my new situation. I hate being bullied! I hate stupid rules! Hey, that’s what I’m supposed to be escaping. So much for freedom. I’m supposed to be paying attention to class, learning their version of military history and the Navy rules and regulations, but I’ve already read these books. My recruiter loaned them all to me before I got here. I’ve already quoted page and paragraph to my Company Commander, showing that as a woman I don’t have to cut my hair, only keep it up off my collar. So much for keeping a low profile. Why can’t I ever take the easy path?   I go through the same pointless segregation of the sexes again at lunch, but this time I have a plan. I choose my targets carefully; they are the popular ones, the outspokenly disgruntled ones and the watch wearing ones. I pass the idea along, careful not to let the ones in power know what’s up. The time has been set. The plan formed. The plan widely disseminated. I continue to check on our progress throughout our segregated afternoon classes. I make sure the plan crisscrosses the line.   Again, I am standing in company formation waiting for dinner. This is the third meal of this new routine. You would think it would move faster now, but no, the line has stalled out. There is no movement, no coming and going of the recruits as they finish dinner and head off to study or practice folding their clothes for the next inspection. No movement, company after company of recruits all standing at ease awaiting their turn at what ever slop is being served tonight.   Finally I’m allowed in line. I dish up my meal. I take some of everything. Lots of everything! I sit down with my company and eat my fill. We all watch our Master at Arms. None of us leave early. Exactly 20 minutes after our Master at Arms sits down, she stands, tray in hand and surveys the company. Seventy nine recruits stand as one; we drop off our trays for the Kitchen Police. Mine is not the only try that is still full to over flowing. The dirty try conveyer is avalanched with the sudden dump from exiting recruits. The excess food and slimy dishes clattering to the floor as we quickly walk back to our barracks. None are late returning.   CRASH, bang, clank, clatter! I quietly drop from the bunk to do it all again. There is no announcement this time, but when we get to the mess hall things have quietly returned to normal. We learn from the KP that the last recruit was served dinner some time after 2300 and the KP were up all night cleaning the mess. More than 8000 recruits participated. Ah, esprit de corps! I think we’ve got it.   Never again will I believe that I am helpless. Never again will I believe myself powerless. Government abuse can only persist in the face of an apathetic citizenry. I have learned to choose my fights with care, but not based on the size of my opponent.  © 2008 Dianne",140,2303,0,0,1,1,©

t5_2qpp6,EvilTomahawk,1334952610,"▶ Must we play StarCraft 2?  Fomos: There are gains and losses with the introduction of SC2 into our league, but most of the analysis points to the fact that running a SC1-exclusive league is no longer viable. Some say that the introduction of SC2 is not a choice, but a necessary step in the world of capitalism. Additionally, the issue of finding a sponsor for Team 8 is not completely independent of the overall decision.  Stars Coach Lee: For STX Coach Lee and myself, we were in this business forever. You can call us the grandfathers, the original fans. Nevertheless, times have changed, and we know that we must accept the changes. Sponsorship and other problems don’t resolve by themselves if we don’t act.  Team 8 Coach Joo: When I meet with corporate executives, I can definitely feel the tensions and worries. Despite that, my personal wish is for StarCraft 1 to fade away as a legend, but maybe in the future we’d say the same thing about StarCraft 2. None of us can stop the flow of time. The reality is that not a single country outside Korea has an offline StarCraft 1 league right now. In the times where eSports is going global, we can’t help but choose StarCraft 2. The times demand that we play both SC1 and SC2. Soon the proleague will be completely SC2, but I dearly wish that we don’t abandon SC1, which has led and carried eSports for the past decade. Personally, I wish that SC1 would continue, even if the league is much smaller and shorter.  STX Coach Kim: Even if one doesn’t agree with the introduction of SC2, the real problem has nothing to do with the selection of the game. We have made numerous mistakes in the past and there are still many things we can improve on, but if we don’t correct them right now then we will be here and discussing the same problems again and again. Team 8 Coach Joo just mentioned that the transition to SC2 was demanded by the popular culture at this time, but I think it’s our fault that we made SC1 less popular. There was no shortage of popular games in the past decade. Cart Rider and Sudden Attack have much greater number of users than StarCraft 1. Instead of looking at the transition as a cultural evolution kind of view, I think the fault is that we didn’t give it our best when SC1 scene was at its peak. Really, we’ve boasted about the 100,000 crowd attendance at Gwang-ahn-ri (most of the PL finals were held at this beach), and done nothing else. It will be the same with SC2. Just because it has a large global market, we can’t be naïve about the game. There is no guarantee that the same problems won’t arise again.  Fomos: But sure, when SC2 came out, SC1 suddenly felt old, and many felt an obligation to play SC2.  STX Coach Lee: I think Blizzard named their new game very well. If the name of SC2 wasn’t “StarCraft 2”, I’m quite certain we wouldn’t even need to have this talk right now.  Team 8 Coach Joo: The things I said about tidings of time and culture didn’t mean that we must absolutely play SC2. I was just lamenting at the fact that Korea is the only country with a proper SC1 league. It’s true that SC2 isn’t as popular here in Korea as it is globally. Look at MLG, they’ve grown to the stage that they can rent out the Anaheim Convention Centre, and attract a huge number of fans despite the entrance fee. The important fact is that when we made a grand scene with SC1, the global focus was mediocre at best, but the potential for the same is much better with SC2 right now. eSports infrastructure is being developed and refined overseas at an unprecedented pace.  STX Coach Lee: Well, SC1 was released in 1998 and about 2 years later, the game in itself has already sort of faded off. We revived it as legitimate eSports content and have kept it going for this long, until today. It was essentially dead overseas and many people pointed fingers at us for playing an archaic game. However, as times passed, the number of SC1 fans increased, both here and globally. When did TeamLiquid first launch? I feel like the number of SC1 fans are actually steadily growing globally. Of course, we can’t really compare with the number of SC2 fans, but the interest for SC1 is definitely there. Some are saying SC2 will open the doors to globalize the Korean eSports scene, but I have a different viewpoint on this. Some say sending Korean players to overseas SC2 market is globalization and expansion. I see it as a reduction of our domestic eSports scene. Yes, earning foreign currencies overseas is good for players, but for so many years we’ve declared ourselves the leading eSports country, and it sounds like we’ve given up on being the leader now. If we had a strong infrastructure here and sold only the contents overseas, the players wouldn’t need to go far away to have a sustainable career.  Fomos: Realistically, it seems impossible for SC1 to be globalized in the way you described it.  STX Coach Kim: I know that’s the general consensus around, but have anyone really tried their best to do it? The popularity of SC1 rose naturally without any extravagant marketing efforts. The large number of replies on videos and articles on TeamLiquid didn’t exist a couple years ago. If we want to globalize with SC1, we should have explored those options much earlier. We were consumed in our own arrogance that SC1 was “our” league.  Fomos: On a related note, it is very unfortunate that the Shanghai Proleague finals were cancled last year. It may have been too little too late, but it was one of the largest attempts at globalizing SC1 content.  STX Coach Kim: Exactly. Those should have been made available from the beginning. I’m not an educated expert on global economy, but in the past two decades where major investments were made into the Chinese market, eSports failed to look into the possibilities. The reason why I’m blabbing on about this is that we must not miss those opportunities in SC2. When we commit ourselves to SC2, we have to do our best to make it enjoyable, and we must not make the same mistakes we made with SC1. Shouting “globalization” without any credible knowledge is not the solution.  ▶ How fast will the existing progamers adapt to SC2?  Fomos: When SC2 is incorporated, one of the major worries is that neither game will be at the high quality we are accustomed to. Let’s discuss.  STX Coach Lee: Right now, there is no point in comparing with GSL or other established SC2 leagues. Our job is to work hard to appeal to our fans in the best way possible.  CJ Coach Kim: I agree that we shouldn’t be comparing game level/quality with other established leagues, but fans will still compare. Then again, our fans have confidence in our progaming team system and the years of experience, so they will patiently wait for us to catch up and even exceed.  Team 8 Coach Joo: The preparation time is very short and the two games will coexist side-by-side instead of a full transition, so it will be tough in many ways. I’d like to share a little story with our team. You all know that we helped SKT prepare for the finals by being sparring partners. To be honest, since we didn’t make the playoffs, we were already practising SC2 at the start of postseason. When our players went back to SC1 one morning, they felt like the screen was lagging. Many of them made hotkey mistakes. Then, the same day afternoon, the issues subsided and we were grooving along as usual. Our practice games were amazing, and we beat SKT 4:2 on the mock finals (laughs). Since SC2 has a much faster pace, some players actually micromanaged better in SC2. There will be complaints in the beginning, but most of them will adjust just fine.  Fomos: Perhaps an analogous situation would be runners training with sandbags then taking them off near the competition date? Please share more stories like this, I’m sure the readers are curious!  Stars Coach Lee: I first thought that the better players in SC1 would be better players in SC2, but it didn’t hold true for everyone. It’s more of a case-by-case thing. Some players are only good at SC1, some only at SC2, and some are good at both. In any case, I’m confident that practice will make up for the gaps. Honestly, some of the players that were, let’s say, terrible at SC1, are now absolutely demolishing others in SC2. We all started at the same time, but already we’re seeing skill differences.  ▶ StarCraft 2, a new opportunity for players?  Team 8 Coach Joo: One thing that’s changed in our team is that our players were never late to lunch, and after that they all took the scheduled rest. Now, after lunch, all of them head straight to the computers. It’s a new game and they find it interesting. I think some of them know that it’s a new opportunity to climb the ranks, so they focus better than before.  CJ Coach Kim: It’s true. Some of our players used to feel like catching up to the top class SC1 players were simply impossible. Now, everyone feels like they’re on even ground. They’re very committed their practice time.  Team 8 Coach Joo: For all the players who lived in the shadows of TBLS, SC2 is a great opportunity. It’s like someone hit the reset button, and we’re off to a new race.  Fomos: To look at the positive side of things, the bottom-rank players would aim to be the new TBLS of SC2, and the existing TBLS and similar level players would aim not to lose their prestigious positions.  Stars Coach Lee: Some of our old players that considered retirement in the past while actually regained the passion while practising for both games. If we kept going with SC1 only, our team would have had retirement news to release.",37213,15326,0,0,0,1,▶
t5_2qpp6,EvilTomahawk,1334952654,"▶ Coaches chat about the Proleague  Fomos: It seems like the coach of the champions, SKT Head Coach Park, became rather silent in the past few minutes. I know that you guys are planning to have a vacation in Hawaii, but after that you’ll be strapped on practice time for Season 2.  SKT Coach Park: There are so many things in my mind right now. Even if we squeeze out every day we can, we get 10 days or so.  CJ Coach Kim: Still, the word around town is that SKT will win the upcoming season anyway.  Stars Coach Lee: Yeah! I heard SKT is full of grandmasters.  Team 8 Coach Joo: Is that why the upcoming season is being delayed a little? Did you all hear about the delay?  All: Hehehe  Fomos: If the season is delayed, teams get more practice time... is that why?  CJ Coach Kim: Our team is fine if the season starts tomorrow. Let’s not give SKT time to practice!  SKT Coach Park: No! Why are you guys all ganging up on me?  Fomos: Wow, the jealousy towards the winning team is definitely real! Back on topic, do some teams just have inherent advantages when it comes to preparing for SC2?  Stars Coach Lee: Yep, that’s SKT. They act fast, and they somehow get all the information before we do. Plus they steal replays.  CJ Coach Kim: When it comes to SC2, the team is SKT. I heard they are very good already. I heard Bisu and Fantasy were already grandmasters on the ladder, and some others as well.  SKT Coach Park: All rumours, I say! Our best player is diamond. You guys are too caught up in the fact that we practiced SC2 prior to the previous season, but we honestly stopped playing SC2 when the season started, and only recently picked it up again. Actually, what I know is that STX practiced SC2 early, even during Season 1.  STX Coach Lee: Who told you that? We didn’t touch SC2 during Season 1.  SKT Coach Park: We honestly played SC2 for just 2 weeks, okay? We forbid the players from playing it after that.  STX Coach Kim: The word around town back then was that SC2 would be incorporated into Season 1. KeSPA kept hinting at that, so we did our part in preparing for it. In Season 1, we were at a disadvantageous position because we spent too much time on SC2.  SKT Coach Park: Another thing I want to clarify: we ended our SC2 practice after those two weeks not because we heard that SC2 wouldn’t be included in Season 1, but because there were so many new maps for SC1. We decided to allocate our time to those new maps, not SC2.  CJ Coach Lee: Considering the “lucky” timing... you also understand that we had to shake our heads about that? (laughs)  STX Coach Kim: Knowing where to get up-to-date information is a good skill to have.  SKT Coach Park: No, that’s not true. Regarding SC2-related information, isn’t Woongjin the fastest to access those?  Team 8 Coach Joo: Woongjin does get the info quickly but they’re just slow at reacting.  All: Hahaha  STX Coach Lee: Yeah, fine, our team spent a considerable amount of time practising SC2. We do have grandmasters in our team. Many of our players felt hostile towards the new game in the beginning, but now they’ve accepted it and they enjoy the game for the most part.  Fomos: When it comes to freedom and low-pressure environment, it’s Samsung Khan. Coach January, how is your team doing?  Khan Coach January: Our team’s practice schedule is the toughest of all teams, so I don’t know why people think our guys have it easy. We are not a loose-minded team. We are practising SC2 at about the same pace as the other teams, but at the moment, I think we are the worst at SC2.",37213,15326,0,0,0,1,▶
t5_2qpp6,EvilTomahawk,1334952666,"▶ Things to prepare before SC2  KT Coach Lee: Personally, we are lacking diversity and quantity in contents. We’re down to just a single broadcasting station and we lost one of the two major individual leagues, so there are too little games nowadays. I hope that with the addition of SC2, more contents will be made available. Other than leagues and competitions, I hope we get more events and TV variety shows. Instead of viewing it as an acceptance of failure in SC2, we should look at SC2 as a new opportunity for expanding our scene.  Team 8 Coach Joo: As Coach Lee said, I hope Ongamenet will be with us in making good preparations for the addition of SC2. Perhaps an introductory-level program, for the fans, would be beneficial.  Stars Coach Lee: All of OGN, KeSPA, the teams, and sponsors must work together to form a positive atmosphere. Our job is to showcase the exciting, high-level games, but all is meaningless if there are no fans. We have to prioritize our fans. There is very little time remaining, and we must act fast.  KT Coach Lee: Do you remember the program called “Doctor Yong’s Manner Pylon”? [T/N: Kingdom had his own SC1 show] In the beginning people were confused as to why such a show was necessary, but I remember that it gained popularity quite quickly and the viewership numbers were decent. Similar kind of informative and fun programs will be needed for SC2.  SKT Coach Park: I agree, and I have similar ideas as well. I hope that the association will vitalize the amateur scene with amateur leagues and such. Playing it once is better than hearing about it a hundred times. We have to work towards increasing the number of users.  CJ Coach Lee: But, from OGN’s point of view, they can’t allocate that much time and money into SC2 if they aren’t going to have the viewership numbers to justify it. Nowadays, they’re trying very hard to popularize LoL.  Stars Coach Lee: Hopefully we’ll have more broadcasting stations and internet casts in the future. It may seem unreasonable to do everything at once right now, but these are issues that we must eventually tackle together, piece by piece.  ▶ Time will remedy the players’ skill issue.  Fomos: With all that being said, the number of SC1 fans still overwhelms the number of SC2 fans in Korea. In that aspect, the addition of SC2 seems rather force-fed. To hold on to fan support, the key will be how fast can players showcase the level of skill they used to in SC1. Some fans worry that should some of the high-profile SC1 fail to adapt, their legends and records will be tainted. For example, a godly figure like Flash can potentially crumble to newbies in SC2, or he could continue his dominance in the new game as well.  KT Coach Lee: Flash didn’t play SC2 for a long time. All the experience he has with SC2 comes from a short period of time while he was in rehabilitation. He didn’t even know what the units do or were good at, but he managed to reach masters with ease. I am one of the many that are curious to see how well he will do in SC2.  All: Sigh, it’s Flash again.  Khan Coach January: We should force Flash to play Protoss in SC2.  Team 8 Coach Joo: Nono, I’ll make Jaedong play Terran so you should make Flash play Zerg~.  KT Coach Lee: Prior to this season, the abolishment of ace matches attracted a ton of criticism, and many fans were worried for us. However, many fans grew to appreciate and enjoy the new format anyway. We can make it enjoyable for the fans.  Stars Coach Lee: The current generation of SC2 superstars all have some history with us. MVP used to be with us. Other ex-BW progamers include Nestea, July, MMA, etc. Maybe we can call them for some helpful tips on how to transition successfully. I am confident that all the players will reach excellent playing quality in a very short time.  KT Coach Lee: If we had the time, we could have tested it out in a pre-season format. Too bad that we’re running short.  Stars Coach Lee: The bottom line is, if the addition of SC2 fails, both SC1 and SC2 could die. In the times where eSports is losing its fire, we have to do whatever it takes to make it burn brightly again. If the side-by-side, mixed format happens to go well with the fans, I’m fine with this format for the season after that as well.  Team 8 Coach Joo: Pessimistic people said that SC1 has been dead for years now, but look at the recent Proleague Finals. The game quality was excellent, and fan support was overwhelming. Again, we come back to this, the key to the future of eSports is in the hands of the fans. Another important aspect is the history of eSports, written by the star players. I am certain that in SC2, star players and stylistic players will arise and make headlines. I hope that teams and media can catch on to those and produce interesting stories for the ages. From what I’ve seen at our practice, game quality will not be a problem for long.  ▶ Last words, for the fans!  Fomos: Thank you all for participating. Before we call it a day, I would like each one of you to have a few words for the fans.  STX Coach Kim: I fear that I happened to play devil’s advocate today, but really I am excited and hopeful for the upcoming season. Playing both games will not be easy, especially when we are relatively unfamiliar with one of the games. However, SC2 has a simple interface and we have transferrable skills from SC1, so it won’t take long. I’m sure if you fans stick with the players and the teams, you will be comfortable with the new format. We are facing a new challenge, and I hope that you will be there with us.  Khan Coach January: It’s sad that the new format was hammered down to us with very little input from the players and the teams. That’s why I didn’t have a lot to say in this conference. As a coach, I will do my best and I can say for the players that they’ll each give it their best as well. Pushing for the survival of SC1 may be a tough thing to ask, but I hope the upcoming leagues will reflect the opinions and desires of the fans and the players. I ask you to be open-minded about the changes, and we’ll do our part to provide you with quality content.  STX Coach Lee: Let me add that it’s true what Coach January said; communication within the league is not very active. I hope that that more communication windows will be open between the players, fans, coaches, sponsors, and the league.  Team 8 Coach Joo: Fans support was overwhelming as always in Season 1, but we didn’t have enough contents to showcase. After all, SC1 only had one league in the past few months. We can’t let our guard down just because the stadium attendance was up. When SC2 is added, I know that satisfactory smiles from SC1 game could immediately turn into frowns when SC2 is aired next. We will do our best to prevent that from happening. If fans leave the scene, eSports will cease to exist. I hope that some of the league executives and producers will keep that in mind.  Stars Coach Lee: There will be uphills and downhills. Now we aim to climb a new mountain. KeSPA, the teams, and the players – we all have to climb together. I was full of worries at first, but now have high hopes for the future. SC2 isn’t the end solution, and it’s possible that we try different games in the future too. No matter what mountain lies ahead, I hope the fans will be with us all the way. Lastly, since TBLS is all reset now, next season belongs to Woongjin Stars!  CJ Coach Kim: I think all the coaches want to say the same thing. We’ll give it our best, and we’re positive that the outcome will be good as well. Even outside of eSports, new challenges shake things up and negativity will be there in the beginning. Please continue to support us, and let us know how we can make it better for you. We will do our best.  KT Coach Lee: Even after the closing of MBC Game and the disbanding of several teams, we couldn’t have a proper conference like this. I know that this conference owes a lot to Fomos and their 5th anniversary celebration, but I also think the desire for the better future of eSports put us together today. Every single player, every single person involved is working with the common goal, so I ask you to let us know how you feel. Give us both criticism and support. Soon before you know it, we’ll dazzle you with the games you love.  SKT Coach Park: For the loyal SC1 fans, I understand the mixed format looks like a complete foolish gimmick. I hope you understand that it was the best we could do under the current circumstances. I encourage you to have high hopes for the upcoming season. I’m confident that Bisu and Fantasy will be global leaders in SC2, so look out for us!

Last time I did a big clean, I recycled out [a lot of garbage](http://i.imgur.com/TR5AT.jpg), I bought a Billy from IKEA for all my crap, and ordered a long Firewire cable, so all my external drives are off my desk, and I finally have enough space for a mouse. * Fixing up my car (typically sub-$100 repairs, usually in the $5-25 range) * Driving [cool cars with the right kind of music blasting](http://i.imgur.com/fBgxW.jpg).

The screen is the part of the laptop that you'll spend the most time interacting with, so don't skimp on it. * NVIDIA® GeForce® GTX 675M (Fermi) 2GB GDDR5 - A powerful GPU will be the most important thing for gaming. You might want to consider waiting until more powerful cards become available - I've heard good things about the 7990M and 7970M, though I don't know when they'll be out (read: not in the next month). * Hard Drive - Either go with an SSD or a Hybrid drive. The P150EM and P151EM *should* support mSATA drives, but Malibal doesn't seem to offer that; if you were to buy from XoticPC, I would recommend an 80GB mSATA drive as the OS and either a normal HD or a Hybrid drive, depending on your budget (alternatively, to avoid having to deal with limited space on the OS drive, an mSATA configured as SRT and a large HD). * IC Diamond 7 Thermal Compound, CPU &amp; GPU - You don't want to overheat, and the better thermal compound will help a bit. * Processor Upgrades - The i7-2670QM is probably fast enough for DIII, though it couldn't hurt to upgrade it a bit; if you wait for a few days it might be replaced with a IB variant at the same price (NDA is lifting tomorrow, supposedly, which would mean that they'll probably be available to buy sometime this coming week). * Memory Upgrades - From what I've heard, there's not much noticeable difference between 1600Mhz RAM and 1866Mhz RAM, and 8GB is enough for gaming; you can always upgrade it later if you really need it. * Wireless - I recall reading an article comparing the basic wifi card with higher-end variants; the main difference was in the time it took to connect to wireless networks.

t5_2s8bl,fightslikeacow,1335116289,"[](/c29) Alternate Season 3 opens with the Mane 6, Cadence and Shining Armor dragging running away when the Changeling Queen is distracted by the new power.  Shining Armor and Cadence have to forcibly prevent Twilight from staying to protect Celestia, while Rainbow Dash assures Twilight that she'll be all right, she's one tough pony.  (Fluttershy mutters under her breath that she's not so sure.)  Cut to opening theme song.    As they run through the castle, they realize that they still need to find the Elements of Harmony.  Now the Changelings are super-powered, but they're starting to fight amongst themselves, as some wish to consume all of Canterlot, but others want to use their new power to take power in the heirarchy of changelings, some run off to go and conquer their own corner of the world.  A few are just changing into stranger and stranger things.  One changes into Discord, and suddenly its eyes go googly and it sprints away to the Canterlot Gardens.    Our heroes take their chance and, through a series of close calls (and more than a few Changelings tricked in the confusion), sneak their way to the Elements.  Along the way, they meet up with Spike, who tells them that he saw Twilight's parents be teleported away by friends of theirs.  They had looked like they were in a state of shock.  The Changeling Queen is seen in cutaway scenes consolidating her power, while Celestia tries to talk her into saving the ponies of Equestria, especially from the muderous rage of one of her chief lieutenants. Meanwhile, that lieutenant (let's call him the Changeling Commander) discovers the existence of the Elements of Harmony from a librarian he eats (he was disguised as the one book this librarian needed to take before she fled, as she clutches it to her chest with one hoof, the book mutates and expands, growing teeth and a mouth that swallows her in one gulp.   Our heroes get to the Elements, and Twilight convinces her friends not to run away with the Elements, as they had originally been planning, but to use them to defeat the Changelings now.  Its the only way to save Celestia, and the only way to save Canterlot.  If they don't make a stand, thousands of ponies will die.  Shining Armor, however, is not convinced.  The Changeling Queen overpowered *Celestia*, and that was before she got supercharged by Cadence, Princess of Love.  He's not looking forward to seeing his little sis and his fiancÃ©e, his two favorite ponies in the world, be destroyed. They need a plan and they need more muscle. They can regroup with the Royal Guard battalion who were doing training maneuvers outside of Trottingham. Shining Armor is a Captain of the Royal Guard, and isn't about to argue, so he tries to teleport them away to safety, but he is too weak.  So's Cadence.  Twilight won't take no for an answer. She and her friends have saved Equestria twice with the Elements of Harmony, her brother doesn't know how much she's grown.  They agree to put it to a vote.  Three ponies are for leaving: Shining Armor, Cadence, Spike (sheepishly) and Rarity--what Shining Armor said made sense.  Fluttershy abstains.  But more are against leaving: Rainbow Dash, Applejack, Twilight, Pinkie Pie and... Spike?  The first Spike laughs an evil laugh.  He's the Changeling Commander, who slipped in while they argued.  The Commander transforms into a huge version of himself and grabs Fluttershy before Twilight can teleport them out.  End part 1.  To be continued.",3656,1028,0,0,1,1,©

t5_2qzb6,TominatorXX,1335134717,"I'm so sorry for your struggles with this disease and I wish you the best of luck. I have a close loved one who is struggling with cancer as well. I recently read with interest a Harper's magazine article discussing alternative fasting during chemotherapy resulting in much higher survival rates.  http://harpers.org/archive/2012/03/0083829   Personally, we have found information about Joanna Budwig useful. Basically it's using a strict diet and cottage cheese and flaxseed oil to help oxygenate your cells. Budwig was a German government biochemist who studied fats and oils.    This website has a lot of the research that supports her theory and the basic outlines of her diet, the flaxseed/cottage cheese, etc.  It's basically an organic, vegetarian diet with cottage cheese and flaxseed oil blended. Avoid all sugar and meat. Her books are on amazon.  http://www.healingcancernaturally.com/budwig_protocol.html   What I find impressive about Budwig is she's a 7-time Nobel nominee, a German scientist who worked for the German government researching the health effects of oils and fats. Link to research page and testimonials: http://www.healingcancernaturally.com/index-budwig-testimonials-research.html Who Was Dr. Johanna Budwig? Dr. Johanna Budwig (born 30 September 1908, died 19 May 2003, pronounced Yaw-hun-nah Bood-vig), a seven-times Nobel prize nominee, was a qualified German pharmacologist, chemist and physicist with a doctorate in physics who worked as the chief expert-consultant for drugs and fats at the former Bundesanstalt für Fettforschung (Federal Institute for Fats Research). Described as ""the world's leading authority on fats and oils"", Dr. Budwig studied in-depth the effect of hydrogenated and other denatured fats upon human health and found it to be desastrous, while she discovered the truly ""essential"" and powerfully healing nature of essential fatty acids on all manner of degenerative diseases including cancer. She authored numerous books (among them Cancer - The Problem and The Solution, Das Fettsyndrom [The Fat Syndrome, discussing the links between fats and next to all diseases of the heart and lung as well as cancer], Krebs, ein Fettproblem [Cancer - A Fat Problem, on the right choice and use of fats], Der Tod des Tumors [The Death of the Tumor], as well as numerous scientific papers and treatises in which she published her findings on the critical importance of the right fatty acids and the deleterious effect of the wrong fats on human health (the use of ""wrong fats"" having become widespread since the invention and ubiquitous introduction of the hy  YOU CAN GET HER BOOKS ON AMAZON.  BELOW ARE SNIPPETS FROM THE WEBSITE.    Cancer: Essentially A Problem of Right and Wrong Fats &amp; Lack of Sunlight? An important introduction to Dr. Budwig's protocol Copyright © 2005 - 2011 Healing Cancer Naturally ""What she (Dr. Johanna Budwig) has demonstrated to my initial disbelief but lately, to my complete satisfaction in my practice is: CANCER IS EASILY CURABLE, the treatment is dietary/lifestyle, the response is immediate; the cancer cell is weak and vulnerable; the precise biochemical breakdown point was identified by her in 1951 and is specifically correctable, in vitro (test tube) as well as in vivo (real)..."" Dr. Dan C. Roehm M.D. FACP (oncologist &amp; former cardiologist) in ""Townsend Letter for Doctors"", July 1990 What would you think if you heard someone claim that there is a diet-based protocol centered on the ingestion of two simple foodstuffs plus sunlight that has actually helped heal numerous cases of cancer including saving the so-called terminally ill - some given a few hours to live!? If you react like many, you will think that this sounds far too simplistic to be true. And yet it is. As Dr Willner, M.D., Ph.D. (The Cancer Solution) writes, ""Numerous, independent clinical studies published in major medical journals world-wide confirm Dr. Budwig’s findings…. Over 40 years ago Dr Budwig presented clear and convincing evidence, which has been confirmed by hundreds of other related scientific research papers since, that the essential fatty acids were at the core of the answer to the cancer problem…You will come to your own conclusions as to why this simple effective prevention and therapy has not only been ignored—it has been suppressed!"". Or as someone commented, ""Over the years I have been given a lot of different advice as well, so when I heard about Dr Budwig’s protocol I too was very sceptical, until I tried it."" Before you proceed to reading any further, please know that not everybody reacts the same to this or any other treatment, and that in any healing diet or protocol one may undertake, one should never underrate the often amazing power of the Mind, i.e. the placebo or belief effect, as well as the influence of the emotions and energetic and spiritual factors on both the disease and healing process.   Comments on Dr. Budwig’s work As mentioned above, Dr. Budwig and her work have been attacked and silenced by vested medical, industrial and pharmaceutical interests throughout her life (compare History of Alternative Cancer Treatment). A very balanced comment by Dr. Vincent Gammill of the non-profit Center for the Study of Natural Oncology reads: ""Budwig's observations were correct, but her conclusions require clarification. Flax oil or FSO/CC [cottage cheese] is not in and of itself an anticancer diet. It simply helps correct (perhaps even overcorrects) an omega-3 deficiency in our diet. This can affect many pathways ranging from prostaglandins to cellular immune function."" In fact, Dr Armin Grunewald, MD, Dr. Budwig's nephew concurs when he writes, ""Dr. Budwig's approach is not a method of healing cancer but a technique which strengthens the body's own immune defence against cancerous cell  Memorable Quotes on Dr. Budwig's work In addition to quotes already featured above, here are statements by Dr. Budwig and more comments by several physicians and researchers. ""This diet is far and away the most successful anti-cancer diet in the world"". Dr. Dan C. Roehm M.D. FACP (oncologist &amp; former cardiologist) ""I suggest that all those who find it necessary to add other protocols or to add supplements to it have not even given the Budwig Protocol half a chance. They just don't look beyond the flaxoil/cottage cheese part. There is much more to it than that. It is a scientifically well thought out, all natural approach to health, that has a tremendous rate of success and track record... and it costs next to nothing. I think that if it were very expensive and much money could be made on it, it would be much more popular because it would be pushed by business. But as it stands, it doesn't lend itself to it. So you have to take it at practically no cost or go for some other high priced methods."" Wilhelm H ""It's not the results of the ‘bone scans’ or ‘CTs’ which are of crucial importance ... but whether the cancer can be gotten under control or not. While many of the test methods used by us physicians are certainly scientific, they say nothing about the patient's state of health*. Dr. Budwig's approach is not a method of healing cancer but a technique which strengthens the body's own immune defence against cancerous cells.""  ""Of all the nutritional theories that I have investigated, Dr. Johanna Budwig’s is definitely number one ... Nowhere in the world have I found not even remotely such fantastic cases as with Dr. Budwig. It’s phenomenal."" Lothar Hirneise, eminent German cancer researcher and author of Chemotherapy Heals Cancer and The Earth Is Flat ""Over 50% of Dr. Budwig's patients were doctors or relatives of doctors who knew why in such a serious disease they would rely on the experiences of this brilliant physicist, chemist and pharmacologist rather than follow the prevailing opinion which says that tumors must be destroyed through chemotherapy and radiation."" From the back cover of Dr. Budwig's last book: Cancer - The Problem and The Solution ""And what do I actually do? I give cancer patients simple, natural foods. That is all. I take sick people out of the hospital, when it is said there that they do not have more than an hour or two left to live, that the scientifically attested diagnosis is at hand and that the patient is completely moribund. In most cases I can help even these patients quickly and conclusively.""",13781,122420,0,0,1,1,©

Published on Tuesday, February 24, 2004 by the Los Angeles Times  Politics Questioned in Hospital Plan Proposed children's facility in Iraq is backed by first lady and linked to a Bush family friend  by T. Christian Miller and Johanna Neuman   WASHINGTON — Earlier this year, First Lady Laura Bush formed an unusual alliance with the White House National Security Council to fund a new state-of-the-art children's hospital in Iraq.  But rather than being embraced as a welcome addition to a nation with a shattered healthcare system, the proposed hospital has quietly become a battleground.  Critics have questioned not only the wisdom of a high-end hospital in a country without basic healthcare, but the politics behind the proposal. The hospital would be operated under the guidance of Project Hope, a charity whose president is a Bush family acquaintance from Texas.  The clash, believed to be one of the few between the White House and Congress over a specific reconstruction project, has left the National Security Council bargaining for the hospital's fate and legislators questioning the administration's overall plan to rebuild Iraq.  ""I am concerned about spending large sums on a state-of-the-art hospital that may be more the result of political pressure than the best use of taxpayer dollars,"" Sen. Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Operations Subcommittee, said in a statement.  In an interview with The Times, Laura Bush acknowledged her support for the project and stressed the importance of improving children's healthcare in Iraq, which has one of the highest rates of child mortality in the Middle East.  She said the idea first came up in conversations with national security advisor Condoleezza Rice and Shirin Tahir-Kheli, the NSC's senior director for democracy, human rights and international operations.  The first lady said she knew Project Hope's chief executive, John P. Howe III, from his days as president of the University of Texas Health Science Center, when President Bush was the state's governor.  Her determination to build the hospital comes as the first lady seeks a higher profile in government and politics during a presidential campaign year. She has already stepped up her appearances at fundraisers and begun a campaign to raise awareness of women's heart health issues.  ""It will be a hospital with new, good equipment,"" Bush said. ""We hope that can come to pass.""  The hospital, with a price tag of at least $500 million, ran into trouble almost as soon as the administration introduced it in Congress in January as part of a cluster of projects to be financed from $18.6 billion in reconstruction funds approved last fall.  The initial proposal called for ""state-of-the-art tertiary pediatric"" care, with a child cancer ward and centers for high-risk pregnancies, burn treatment and even plastic surgery.  Rep. Jim Kolbe, an Arizona Republican who heads the House Appropriations subcommittee on foreign operations, raised doubts about the necessity of such an expensive hospital in a country with little infrastructure, according to GOP sources.  Congressional staffers who reviewed the proposal expressed skepticism about whether it was better to fund a high-end medical facility or pay for basic public health measures such as clean water and vaccinations.  ""It was a question of opportunity cost,"" said a Republican budget analyst. ""We only have so much money. The question is, 'Where is the most productive use?' ""  In response to the objections, NSC officials repeatedly stressed the first lady's backing of the hospital and Project Hope, according to congressional officials who were involved in the negotiations.  In the end, Kolbe agreed to provide about $4 million to the project for drawing up blueprints and operating plans for a hospital focused on primary medical needs.  An NSC official defended the project as necessary to improve children's healthcare in Iraq.  ""A children's hospital will give children access to quality care for a range of pediatric medical conditions and save countless lives,"" the official said.  Another person close to the project said, ""This is more than symbolic.""  The NSC, which has scrambled to repackage the hospital proposal, is expected to come back with a modified plan later this week. The plan is expected to call for Project Hope to raise $50 million for training and equipment for the facility.  One version of the plan called for U.S. taxpayers to fund the hospital under a $50-million contract awarded in open competition by the U.S. Agency for International Development, which has overseen much of the infrastructure improvements to Iraq's health system. The agency would build the hospital so that it could be expanded to the higher-end pediatric facility that was envisioned initially.  USAID officials said such public-private partnerships have been used before, once with Project Hope at a children's hospital in Shanghai. Project Hope raised more than $40 million for that facility.  They stressed that no final decision had been reached on the Iraq project, even though a USAID contractor has posted a job listing on the Internet for a construction manager.  ""These partnerships are a win-win because they bring in the private sector to match the U.S. government contribution, resulting in the best deal for the U.S. taxpayer,"" said Luke Zahner, a spokesman for the agency.  One proposed location for the hospital was Basra, but community leaders there questioned the need for a specialized children's hospital. Improving the decrepit, 682-bed general hospital should take priority, they said. There are also continuing problems with the supply of water and electricity.  More than 80% of the city government's office equipment, supplies and vehicles were looted after Saddam Hussein's fall last year, said Fakhir Mousawi, Basra's director general.  ""I would prefer that that money be spent on the services and infrastructure that we need right now,"" Mousawi said. ""Most of the public utilities should get maintenance and rehabilitation.""

I think you should keep it but it's important to take care of it if you want to project an image of 'I'm a man who wants long hair' rather than 'I'm too lazy to get a hair cut'.   That jet black is a very sexy hue, but from my own experiences and also having Indian friends with long hair - I also know it can also looks greasy :( Keep product usage to a minimum‼ And explore different products to find something that yields gloss and not grease.  I love the little kink in your locks as they meet your shoulders, but I think straight hair suits you much, much more - maybe invest in hair straighteners or take a little bit of length off so it's not as heavy, if you don't want to cut or straighten it then maybe look at tying it back?  And one last comment - your full body shot shows you to have quite a nice physique, but there is the tiniest bit of baby fat on your cheeks and neck that I think makes you look younger (in the bad way) maybe lose 5lbs and see if that helps?",23679,37,0,0,1,1,‼

t5_2qil9,atomicoption,1335205904,"I'm not sure I can agree with any of that. You're right that *if* the goals for nullsec are as you state, your solutions may help, but I'm not convinced those are the right goals for nullsec.  ***Conflicting visions for nullsec: ***  -----------------------------------------------------  **Vision 1. A land of many princes**  This vision is the one we hear endlessly from small pirate corps who want to damage the sov of major alliances. They want nullsec to be more like lowsec where ownership is fluid from day to day if not hour to hour depending on who can make and maintain a show of force in a given spot. Everyone gets a small chunk of space, but it's very unstable.  People who favor this vision want mechanics that neuter blobs and force the number of pilots in your corp to be much less important if not irrelevant compared to tactics or the skill of your pilots--including for sov. People who prefer this usually favor eliminating structure shoots and implementing mechanics that have nothing to do with your ability to repeatedly field a fleet with the high DPS currently needed to down all the structures and stront timers in a reasonable amount of time..                                    -  **Vision 2. Player owned empires**  This vision is more similar to what we have. In it Sov should work more like the hisec empires do, where major alliances create relatively stable sov regions with complicated hierarchy's of loyalty, alliances, betrayals, espionage and politics.   Sov is purposely difficult to take without a large group of people and huge ISK investment from all different time zones that can be coordinated together for days or weeks. Small pirates and gangs may be able to harass individual ships or other small groups, but they have little chance of seriously damaging (much less taking and holding) sov against the large player empires. This vision is similar to the current idea of the nation in real life where 99% of the places on earth are held by some large country and while a group of 20 guys can make an area unsafe for others, they have no hope (*and shouldn't have any hope*) of actually challenging the sovereign of the area. Territory changes hands via treaty or during large scale wars between alliances, and small corps and alliances rely on NPC pirate sov areas to maintain a foothold.  The people who favor this vision usually just want quality of life changes that break the monotony of endless structure shoots during wars. Some also want a mechanic to police against AFK cloakers, or the easily gankability of mining ops, or the nightmare of large scale logistics.    -----------------------------------------------------------  [full disclosure: I'm in dreddit]  Personally I prefer vision 2 because this is where the biggest drama in EVE comes from. Without large alliances you wouldn't have had the massive, newsworthy scandals, thefts and intrigue that put EVE in the gaming press regularly. Massive wars also give me a sense of being part of Something Important®. EVE is definitely not the most fun game I've ever played, but it is the most *interesting* game. I constantly get distracted by other games that are much more fun, but I keep coming back to EVE because the concepts are just so cool.  Also without the large relatively stable alliance sov areas, nullsec wouldn't be a worthwhile place to make ISK and we'd all have to have hisec mission running alts.",6243,84,0,0,1,1,®

t5_mouw,istoleyourcookie,1335220379,"No, I think you have my idea of fanning the flames right. But do you really have knowledge of all servers to start calling everyone who disagrees with you racist?  First, Any good server (which I'd like to think I am) does they're best to treat all tables equally, even the ones you hate. And don't think that every server sees a black table coming and thinks to themselves, ""well, i'm not giving them service"". I'm pleasantly surprised any time I get a good tip. It's nice to know people like you, and even better when they show it in monetary form. That doesn't mean that my expectations aren't lower for some groups than others.  Second. If a business owner was presented with four different choices of a merchandise vender, he would chose the one that would generate the most money and required the least sacrifice on his part. That's the same choice servers have to make every single day. The problem is this study only looked at black v. white. I would treat a black table better than a white one if they were more polite, but there are other races and other factors out there too. I would treat drinkers better than a church crowd because I know the work would be easier and the reward would be better.  Third. That study really isn't the best one to base an opinion on. It's more of a convenience sample than anything else. It has a small sample size and covers only a small regional are. There are too many lurking variables to give it any real credit.

t5_2s7tt,sammew,1335225841,"All-purpose Flour  Shelf Life: for cabinet storage, up to 8 months if properly stored in a sealed container or if tightly wrapped, and for refrigerator storage, up to one year.   Amaranth Flour  Shelf Life: up to 6 months in the freezer if properly stored in a sealed container or if tightly wrapped.  Other Considerations: will not keep well if it is stored in a warm location or if it is exposed to sunlight. The flavor and aroma of amaranth flour will become bitter if it is stored improperly or for an excessively long period.   Barley Flour  Shelf Life: up to 4 months in the freezer in a sealed container or if tightly wrapped. The flour has a short shelf life when stored in a cabinet.  Bread Flour    Shelf Life: several months in a cool, dry cabinet when stored in a sealed container or if tightly wrapped, and up to one year in the freezer.  Brown Rice Flour    Shelf Life: 4 to 5 months when stored in the refrigerator and up to one year in the freezer when stored in a sealed container or if tightly wrapped.  Other Considerations: has a high oil content (because of the bran and germ), which causes it to become rancid if stored improperly or if stored for an excessive length of time.  Buckwheat Flour    Shelf Life: up to 2 to 3 months in the refrigerator and for 6 months or longer in the freezer in a sealed container or if tightly wrapped.  Corn Flour    Shelf Life: up to one year in a cool, dark cabinet if properly stored in a sealed container or if tightly wrapped. The shelf life increases if the flour is stored in the freezer.  Flaxseed Meal/Flour    Shelf Life: 2 or 3 months if properly stored in a cool, dry cabinet in an airtight container that does not permit light to pass through. It will keep 6 months in the freezer.  Other Considerations: exposure to light will deteriorate the effectiveness of the omega-3 fatty acids in the flaxseed meal/flour, which are so effective in reducing cholesterol. When shopping for flaxseed meal/flour, look for packages that protect it from exposure to light.  Job's Tears Flour    Shelf Life: several months in the refrigerator and 6 months or more in the freezer if properly stored in a sealed container or if tightly wrapped.  Kamut® Flour    Shelf Life: up to one year freezer storage if properly stored in a sealed container or if tightly wrapped.  Other Considerations: whole-grain Kamut flour usually lasts longer than whole-grain wheat flour because it has a lower moisture content than wheat.  Masa Harina    Shelf Life: about one year if properly stored in a sealed container or if tightly wrapped in the freezer. It will keep several months in a cool, dry cabinet.  Millet Flour    Shelf Life: millet flour will keep for about 2 months in the refrigerator and 6 months or longer in the freezer. The flour should be tightly wrapped for refrigerator or freezer storage. A completely filled and sealed glass jar also works well for refrigerator storage.  Other Considerations: can become rancid quite rapidly if it is not properly stored. It is usually best to grind millet as needed to ensure the best flavor.  Oat Four    Shelf Life: up to 3 months cabinet storage if stored in sealed containers or if tightly wrapped and up to 6 months if stored in the freezer.  Quinoa Flour    Shelf Life: 4 to 6 months in the freezer if stored in sealed containers or if tightly wrapped.  Rye Flour    Shelf Life: whole-grain rye flour should be stored in the refrigerator, tightly wrapped or in an airtight container, where it will keep for several months. It will keep in the freezer for up to a half-year.  Other Considerations: If stored properly, rye flour with the germ removed will keep for longer periods than whole-grain rye flour.  Sorghum Flour    Shelf Life: 4 months freezer storage if properly stored in sealed containers or if tightly wrapped.  Soy Flour    Shelf Life: 5 to 7 months if properly stored, tightly wrapped or tightly sealed plastic or glass containers. The refrigerator or freezer are the best locations for storage.  Other Considerations: full-fat versions of soy flour do not keep as long as the fat-free versions.  Spelt Flour    Shelf Life: if stored in sealed containers or if tightly wrapped, spelt flour will keep for several months in a cool, dry cabinet and 6 to 12 months in the freezer.  Teff Flour    Shelf Life: when stored in tightly sealed containers or if tightly wrapped, teff flour will keep for 4 months in the freezer.  White Rice Flour    Shelf Life: when properly stored, in a tightly covered container in a cool dry location, white rice flour may last indefinitely.  Whole-Wheat Flour    Shelf Life: 6 months to one year in the freezer if stored in tightly sealed plastic containers or if tightly wrapped. It will keep for only a few months if stored in a cabinet.",78812,2914,0,0,1,0,®

After that, just say what the essay is about, history/backstory of the movie/book, and tell them what you're gonna explain in the body paragraph, but don't go into too much detail or repeat your body paragraph.     In the body paragraph, pick two of the questions and write about them.  For the end of the body paragraph, try to relate the two questions/how they affect or influence your views/how your views affect the answer to the question/etc. (This should be the longest paragraph: like 12 sentences.)   In the conclusion, tell them what you have just explained in the body paragraph, but with more thought-provoking stuff about philosophy or relating it to today.  End with a clincher sentence that ties everything together.  Remember to use good transitions from paragraph to paragraph.  Try to make the transition sentence have something in common with the last sentence from the other paragraph.  If you didn't read the book, use sparknotes to get the gist and go from there.   The questions I would go with so you don't have to know too much about the book: ♦ How is the main character developed? ♦ Describe one memorable scene from the book. Why is this scene memorable for you? ♦ Tell why you enjoyed the book or why you did not. It is not enough to say a book is “exciting” or “boring,” you must explain why you feel this way.

t5_2qhx4,DandyManderz,1335261629,"Some people just like to do a little bit of research before they believe the first thing that they hear or read.   GYNECOMASTIA  &gt;Gynecomastia is defined as the accumulation of breast tissue in men and results from increases in the circulating estrogen/androgen ratio.33 Marijuana has been associated with the development of gynecomastia in an early case series,1 but a case control study showed no association.34 Given the effects of marijuana on the HPG axis in males and the possibility that noncannabinoid components of marijuana smoke have affinity to the estrogen receptor,6 an association with gynecomastia is plausible but has not been convincingly demonstrated.      http://www.ukcia.org/research/EndocrineEffects.pdf    Abstract  &gt;Eleven patients diagnosed with idiopathic gynecomastia requiring mammoplasty were compared with matched controls to determine if there was an association between cannabis use and gynecomastia. Patients with gynecomastia were not significantly different from controls regarding their history of cannabis use. For those who admitted using cannabis, patients had a higher average frequency but a shorter median duration of use than controls; differences were not statistically significant. Our epidemiologic evidence does not support the previously reported relationship between chronic cannabis use and gynecomastia.  ☆      The opinions or assertions contained herein are the private views of the authors, and are not to be construed as official or as reflecting the views of the Department of the Army or the Department of Defense.

t5_2qkeh,potterarchy,1335279982,"That's an interesting point. Certainly North Koreans and South Koreans don't call their countries ""North Korea"" and ""South Korea"" - they're ""Democratic People's Republic of Korea"" and ""The Republic of Korea."" So they're kind of fighting over the title of ""Korea,"" and that might be the case with their language, too.   The cool thing about language though, is that after awhile everyone just kind of forgets stuff. Take Pennsylvanian Dutch, for example. The language isn't actually Dutch, it's an old German dialect - called *Deitsch* in Pennsylvanian Dutch (the German word for ""German"" is *Deutsch*, and Pennsylvanian Dutch is a dialect of German, so *Deutsch* and *Deitsch* are related words). Everyone today is completely unaware of this, but once upon a time, the similarities between the *Deutsch* language and the *Deitsch* dialect were totally obvious. It just took a giant upheaval of immigration to the States and several centuries for those two languages to get separated.  [Right now](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_language#Names), South Koreans refer to their language as *[Hangugeo](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%ED%95%9C%EA%B5%AD%EC%96%B4)*, and North Koreans as *[Chosŏnmal](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%EC%A1%B0%EC%84%A0%EB%A7%90)*. [Both *Hanguk* and *Chosŏn/Joseon* are names for Korea](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Names_of_Korea#Ancient_history), and ""-*eo*"" and ""-*mal*"" both mean ""language"" or ""speech"" in Korean, but this knowledge may fade away over time, and those two words might become completely separate.  Again, only really time will tell. It may be that North Korea crumbles, and they're united again under one common language. Or, North Korea may continue to isolate itself - but to what extent, it's uncertain. North Koreans will continue to get access to ""standard"" Korean through their Dear Leader, but what they speak at home may become completely non-standard. We'll have to check back in a couple of centuries.  (Boy, I've just gone all wall-o'-text on this thread. Sorry! I get excited about language... ☺)",92144,73903,0,0,1,1,☺

t5_2tkvu,raisedgrooves,1335317253,"The 42LE 4-Speed Transaxle uses fully-adaptive controls. Adaptive controls are those which perform their functions based on real-time feedback sensor information. The transaxle is conventional in the use of hydraulically applied clutches to shift a planetary gear train. However, it uses electronics to control virtually all other functions. The following components are serviceable in the vehicle: valve body assembly, solenoid pack, manual valve lever position sensor, input and output speed sensors, transfer chain and sprockets, short (right side ) stub shaft seal and the long (left side ) stub shaft and ball bearing. Note that the factory recommends that before attempting any repair on the 42LE 4-speed automatic transaxle, always check for proper shift linkage adjustment. Also check for diagnostic trouble codes with the Chrysler DRB scan tool (or equivalent). Use Mopar® Type 7176 Automatic Transmission Fluid only. Do NOT substitute transaxle fluid. If the differential sump requires fluid, use 80W-90 petroleum based Hypoid gear lubricant. The transaxle can be removed without removing the engine. Use the following procedure. Disconnect negative battery cable. Remove the engine air inlet tube. The crankshaft position sensor is located on the upper right side of the transaxle bell housing. Unplug the crankshaft position sensor connector and remove sensor. Unplug the transaxle wiring connector block located on the right shock tower. To free the connector from the harness, remove the wire ties. Raise and safely support the vehicle. Remove the front wheels. Remove the strut to steering knuckle bolts on both sides of the vehicle. Disconnect the tie-rod ends if required. Remove the Anti-lock Brake System (ABS) wheel speed sensor, if equipped. Remove the halfshafts from the transfer case by inserting a prybar between the halfshaft and the transaxle case and pry the shaft from the transaxle housing. Swing the shafts out of the way keeping the joints straight and suspend using wire. Be careful NOT to damage the halfshaft seals. Do NOT let the halfshafts or CV-joints hang unsupported. Internal joint damage may result if allowed to hang free. Remove the engine-to-transaxle brackets and the transaxle bell housing cover. Mark the driveplate to the torque converter and remove the torque converter bolts. The driveplate-to-torque converter bolts are NOT to be reused. Unbolt and remove the starter assembly from the bell housing and allow the starter motor to sit between the engine and the frame. Disconnect the oil cooler lines from the transaxle and plug to prevent excess fluid leakage. Remove the transaxle dipstick. Disconnect the gear selector cable from the transaxle. Disconnect the exhaust pipe from the exhaust manifold and position out of the way. If the clearance will NOT allow for transaxle removal, remove the exhaust system from the vehicle. Support the transaxle using a transmission jack. Raise the transaxle slightly to relieve the weight off the rear transaxle mount. Remove the engine-to-transaxle brackets and the transaxle mount through-bolt. Remove the rear crossmember mounting bolts. Pry the transaxle mount rearward to separate the mount from the transaxle. Remove the rear crossmember. Lower the rear of the transaxle to gain access to the bell housing bolts. Remove the bell housing bolts. Place a drain pan under the dipstick in the transaxle to catch transaxle fluid that will drain out of the case. Remove the dipstick tube from the transaxle and plug hole. Remove the engine-to-transaxle bolts and lower the transaxle from the vehicle. The driveplate-to-torque converter bolts and the driveplate-to-crankshaft bolts must NOT be reused. Install new bolts when ever these bolts are removed. Inspect the driveplate for cracks. If cracks are present, replace the driveplate.",31896,15344,0,0,1,1,®

t5_2qh1f,powerfox,1335324329,"Most DisplayPort outputs support the cheap adapters linked to above because they're actually capable of producing an HDMI or DVI signal. The adapter simply routes the signals to the correct pins on an HDMI or DVI connector. This is a compatibility mode supported by most output devices known as [DP++](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DisplayPort#Compatibility_with_HDMI.2C_DVI_and_VGA). DisplayPort inputs do not feature this compatibility and are only able to accept DisplayPort signals. HDMI and DVI outputs are usually only capable of outputting HDMI and DVI signals, as well as VGA on some devices. As a result, an active converter like the one I linked to is necessary for connecting an HDMI output to a DisplayPort input.  The product pages for the adapters from Monoprice all include a disclaimer like this: &gt; This device is not bi-directional.  It can only connect a Mini-DisplayPort source to an HDMI® display.  It will not work in reverse.  I have a Dell U2711, which has a DisplayPort input. The full 2560x1440 resolution is only supported using dual-link DVI or DisplayPort. DisplayPort is better than dual-link DVI for several reasons. The cables are much thinner and the connectors are smaller and easier to use. DisplayPort also supports audio, which allows me to connect my speakers to my monitor. This is useful for cable management reasons, but it also allows me to connect my 5.1 speakers to my Mac mini, which would normally require a USB sound card. I also have a Windows desktop that I regularly use. Having the speakers connected to the monitor allows me to switch computers by simply plugging the Mini DisplayPort cable into the one I want to use.

But my Master explained humiliation is really the return of humility...it strips me of all my inhibitions and reservations and there are a LOT of ways He achieves that...  There are times He'll just point out to me the things i love having done to me, and that makes me blush, which He then points out to me, which makes me blush even more...etc. And yes, it turns me on emotionally as well as physically.  So talk about what humiliation means to you, and your Master...i don't think He means to degrade you, but He definitely enjoys putting you in touch with that basic part of your psyche that helps you get into a deeply submissive mindset.

Canadian Helicopter Force (Afghanistan), Task Force Freedom’s Griffon Helicopter Pilots and Door Gunners stay current by practicing their enemy engagement drills at Texas Helo Range.  Flying in evasive maneuvers while engaging targets allows the entire Griffon crew to stay at the top of their game so that when a real threat is encountered they are able to neutralize it with precision.    Operation ATHENA is Canada’s participation in the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan. The mission of Task Force Kandahar, the Canadian-led brigade in ISAF Regional Command (South), is to set the right conditions for sustainable progress in security, governance, development and peace in the districts of Panjwa'i, Dand and Daman in Kandahar Province, in conjunction with the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, the Afghan national security forces, and other coalition and civilian partners.

t5_2sgq6,panthuralexander,1335449676,"No. Mass effect one and two were amazing. But the mass effect 3 dlc ending thats coming soon and the launch dlc wasnt fair at al. Games should be completed when they are released and addons like maps and new quests, or even! Game fixes like the new added ending to mass effect 3 should be free. They used to be free, like back in half life 2 days. It seems like the industry is regressing and screwing all of their player base.

If you lived in a video game world, which game would it be?  **[Answer](/r/IAmA/comments/ssh9y/_/c4gpw3w?context=1) (Gaijinworks):**  &gt; Klonoa.  Love that environment.  *****  **[Question](/r/IAmA/comments/ssh9y/_/c4gpk3y?context=1) (AdviceFromAPyro):**  &gt; Got any EGB swag? I'd love to get my hands on a poster or something.  **[Answer](/r/IAmA/comments/ssh9y/_/c4gpx2q?context=1) (Gaijinworks):**  &gt; Most of that's long gone, and what I do have left isn't ""extra"" so I wouldn't sell it.  All I have left is my Assassin's Case, a few posters, a couple phone cards, and a hand-painted cel used to make one of the animations in the game that the Japanese production staff gave me as a gift.  *****  **[Question](/r/IAmA/comments/ssh9y/_/c4goiu5?context=1) (Minifig81):**  &gt; The problem PTrowe, is, I live on disability. I live on 40$ after taxes, and I get a monthly stipend of 121$ for food (with food stamps) every month.  &gt;  &gt; Moving would cost 4-10 times more than what I'd ever be able to earn in a single month.  **[Answer](/r/IAmA/comments/ssh9y/_/c4gpy84?context=1) (Gaijinworks):**  &gt; If you're disabled, can you even have a job?  Wouldn't you lose your disability?  *****  **[Question](/r/IAmA/comments/ssh9y/_/c4goc5k?context=1) (infinitecandy):**  &gt; Ah thank you for the reply.  Well if it does come out know that it will be a Day 1 purchase!  **[Answer](/r/IAmA/comments/ssh9y/_/c4gpyq2?context=1) (Gaijinworks):**  &gt; We'll do our best.  Thanks for your support!  *****  **[Question](/r/IAmA/comments/ssh9y/_/c4gn4e9?context=1) (InYourHands):**  &gt; So Sony would not allow never before localized titles through the PS2 &amp;amp; PS1 Classics lines? That's actually really disappointing. Part of me hoped that without the disc manufacturing and shipping costs we could've seen a resurgence of games forgotten in Japan. &gt;  &gt; Would you happen to know if the lack of present day PS2 QA would prevent games localized only in Europe from getting a DD-only release?  **[Answer](/r/IAmA/comments/ssh9y/_/c4gq0hb?context=1) (Gaijinworks):**  &gt; If they went through QA anywhere in the world, they would be a candidate for emulated release, but if they required changes (Japanese-&amp;gt;English, for example) they would have to be re-QAed, and if there was no QA line for that platform, that's a problem.  There are a few territories that are still QAing PS2 titles (not the US, but elsewhere), and we're trying to see if we can use those QA lines for a US product, but it's a longshot.  We ARE trying, though.  Hang in there.  *****  **[Question](/r/IAmA/comments/ssh9y/_/c4gpzhy?context=1) (AudibleKnight):**  &gt; I don't really have a question, but as a huge fan of Working Designs, Lunar 1 + 2 (both Sega CD + PS1), Alundra, and Popful Mail I just wanted to thank you for your work in publishing some of my favorite games of all time.  **[Answer](/r/IAmA/comments/ssh9y/_/c4gq2j1?context=1) (Gaijinworks):**  &gt; Thank YOU! Fans like you are why we really pushed the envelope to make the games and their presentation better and will continue to push for that in this venture.  *****  **[Question](/r/IAmA/comments/ssh9y/_/c4gqmrl?context=1) (bigheaddemon):**  &gt; What do you guys think about the success of Carpefulgur, RockinAndroid, XSEED and Nyumedia with bringing Japanese games to steam? Do you see a potential market there? &gt;  &gt; Also Popful Mail is one of my favourite JRPGs, so thanks for allowing me the chance to play it!  **[Answer](/r/IAmA/comments/ssh9y/_/c4gr4do?context=1) (Gaijinworks):**  &gt; Steam is a great platform.  They have been choosier about what games to allow on it, so that's still somewhat of a concern, but I personally only see it getting stronger as an outlet, so it's wise to consider it, for sure. &gt;  &gt; Popful Mail has so many great little bits in it, and the characters like Nuts Cracker are great.  I love it, too.  *****  **[Question](/r/IAmA/comments/ssh9y/_/c4grk2a?context=1) (delyoto):**  &gt; I wish I had seen this sooner.  I have loved the Lunar games since I was a child.  I know that when you were at Working Designs that you made a few references to a Lunar 3, was there any actual talks of creating another game in the series with Studio Alex or were those comments more of a speculative or PR nature?  Also, how do you feel about the Dark Scimitar?  **[Answer](/r/IAmA/comments/ssh9y/_/c4grv41?context=1) (Gaijinworks):**  &gt; What was supposed to be LUNAR 3 was started and stopped numerous times, then Studio Alex was killed and it became really hard for me to see how the next one could happen without its ""heart"". &gt;  &gt; I believe in the power of the Dark Scimitar.  Nothing that cool-looking could disappoint. ;)  *****  **[Question](/r/IAmA/comments/ssh9y/_/c4gruv7?context=1) (smokesteam):**  &gt; Hi Victor, havent spoken to you in *years*. Loved your work with the Sega CD and Saturn titles. Despite some of the fuss regarding the translations I thought you did a bang up job or localization. &gt;  &gt; Seems like you are still maintaining a console focus. I dont have a Sony thingie and probably wont ever buy another one, cant find my DS, but I do have an iPhone and do enjoy ports of the classic RPG games over to IOS. Any chance of you guys doing anything in that area?  **[Answer](/r/IAmA/comments/ssh9y/_/c4gs0vt?context=1) (Gaijinworks):**  &gt; Thanks for the compliments and support from the old days! &gt;  &gt; As long as you promise not to play it on the toilet, I'll see what I can do about iOS in the future.  The toilet should be a iphone-free zone.  *****  **[Question](/r/IAmA/comments/ssh9y/_/c4gt2nw?context=1) (Guild_Navigator):**  &gt; I don't know if it was Victor Ireland,but somebody from GA in an Gamespot interview said 10 years ago almost to the date that ""the die has been cast"". That Sony was going to be the perpetual new console champ and that Xbox ""will NEVER catch on"". &gt;  &gt; Oh how things have changed... Sorry guys,but you don't get a penny from me. Kickstarter is for American gaming only.  **[Answer](/r/IAmA/comments/ssh9y/_/c4gvr8f?context=1) (Gaijinworks):**  &gt; I didn't know stormfront.org members played video games.  *****  **[Question](/r/IAmA/comments/ssh9y/_/c4gtryj?context=1) (Armen80):**  &gt; Hello Victor and John, &gt;  &gt; I have been watching the kickstarter project and being a fan of former WD, I really hope that this will work out eventually. &gt; I had sent some artworks back then during the WD era and remember fondly these days, as well as the high quality packagings of LUNAR and Arc the Lad Collections. &gt;  &gt; I'm an animator/storyboarder, but also worked on indie games like Pier Solar for the Megadrive/MCD and Battlekid 2 for the famicom as cutscene director and character illustrator. &gt; Being a PCE and Lunar fan, I'm also doing a small demo of Lunar the SilverStar for the PCECD. &gt;  &gt; http://www.hostingpics.net/viewer.php?id=713301PCEsaithpreview.png &gt;  &gt; http://www.hostingpics.net/viewer.php?id=556543PCEWDCpreview.png &gt;  &gt; The end of WD also marked the end of an era. I really hope you will succeed and revive the passion that existed back in the old days. &gt;  &gt; Good luck, &gt;  &gt; A.M &gt;  &gt; PS : Still waiting for a localization of Tengai Makyou 2 and Cosmic Fantasy 3 for the PCE/virtual console :) &gt;   **[Answer](/r/IAmA/comments/ssh9y/_/c4gvryt?context=1) (Gaijinworks):**  &gt; Even if this KS doesn't fund, we'll continue on and release the game as Digital only as planned. Once the game is out, it will be an easier sell for the next installements since all of them are so much better than the frist. &gt;  &gt; I love Tengai and hope to do one eventually.  Dtto all the CF ones we didn't do.  *****  **[Question](/r/IAmA/comments/ssh9y/_/c4gvifo?context=1) (allcapsarelocked):**  &gt; You guys should have supported the Dreamcast.  Yeah I know it did not last long but you could have turned a profit on Dreamcast.   &gt;  &gt; Investing in the PS2 did not do you guys that well at all.  There was way to much competition from Square Soft at the time. &gt;  &gt; Also not supporting the XBOX was a big mistake.  XBOX uses would have liked to have a few good Japaneses, but you gave everything to the PS2. &gt;  &gt; Look at what happened Working Design is now dead. &gt;  &gt; And your Kickstarter Class of Heroes 2 Deluxe for the PSP® system is a joke bring that to a dead System now.  You should port it for iOS and Android.  **[Answer](/r/IAmA/comments/ssh9y/_/c4gvtcm?context=1) (Gaijinworks):**  &gt; If other publishers who were supporting Dreamcast were making little or no money, there's no way it would have been profitable for us.  Ditto XBOX - there just weren't many Japanese games at ALL to do because it wasn't popular in Japan (an understatement).   &gt;  &gt; It's much easier to run a video game company from a recliner with imaginary games and imaginary money.  *****  **[Question](/r/IAmA/comments/ssh9y/_/c4gt1bd?context=1) (Dustwhisper):**  &gt; Why has noone managed to create a good JRPG for Europe/US? I LOVE JRPGs but I always found them just a TEENY WHEENY bit too grindy at times, not to mention some of them have some serious mechanic flaws (Like in Blue Dragon where superduper great items might be found in a completely random corner of a rooftop in the desert without an inkling of a hint as to where it might be so it's buttonspam running into walls).  **[Answer](/r/IAmA/comments/ssh9y/_/c4gvv4e?context=1) (Gaijinworks):**  &gt; Actually, the general trend has been to make JRPGs easier, so they practically hold your hand and grinding isn't necessary.   Then at the other end, we have a divergence to ""old-skool"" games like Demon's/Dark Souls where they are mercilessly punishing if you're a careless player.  I personally am a fan of the middle ground to hard type JRPGs.  The hand-holding ones are just boring to me.  They might as well be visual novels.  *****  (continued below)",21827,1,0,0,1,1,®

t5_2qknd,regisfrost,1335463232,"&gt; &gt;Rustling came from nearby. Karam was digging in his fallen tent. He came up with a small bundle. &gt; &gt;“Karam?” Jarid said. &gt; &gt;Karam glanced at Lord Jarid, then lowered his eyes and began to tie a coin pouch at his waist. Halfway through, he stopped and laughed, then emptied it. The gold coins inside had melted into a single lump, like pig’s ears in a jar. Karam pocketed this, probably in case it transformed back eventually, though no man would take it as it was. He fished in the pouch and brought out a ring. The blood-red gemstone at the center was still good. “Probably won’t be enough to buy an apple, these days,” he muttered. &gt; &gt;“I demand to know what you are doing. Is this your doing?” Jarid waved toward the departing soldiers. “You’re staging a mutiny, is that it?” &gt; &gt;“This isn’t my doing,” Karam said, looking ashamed. “And it’s not really yours, either. I’m...I’m sorry.” &gt; &gt;Karam walked away from the torchlight. Bayrd found himself surprised. Lord Karam and Lord Jarid had been friends from childhood. &gt; &gt;Lord Davies went next, running after Karam. Was he going to try to hold the younger man back? Instead he fell into step beside him. They vanished into the darkness. &gt; &gt;“I’ll have you hunted down for this!” Jarid yelled after them, voice shrill. Frantic. “I will be consort to the queen, you realize! No man will give you, or any member of your houses, shelter or succor for ten generations!” &gt; &gt;Bayrd looked back at the stone in his hand. Only one step left, the smoothing. A good spearhead needed some smoothing to be dangerous. He brought out another piece of granite he’d picked up for the purpose and carefully began scraping it along the side of the slate. &gt; &gt;Seems I remember this better than I’d expected, he thought to himself as Lord Jarid continued to rant. &gt; &gt;There was something powerful about crafting the spearhead. The simple act seemed to push back the gloom. There had been a shadow on Bayrd, and the rest of the camp, lately. As if...as if he couldn’t stand in the light no matter how he tried. The darkness was always there, weighing him down. He woke each morning feeling as if someone he’d loved had died the day before. &gt; &gt;It could crush you, that despair. Why would making a spearhead change that? You’re being a fool, Bayrd. It just seemed to him that the mere act of creating something—anything—fought back. That was one way to challenge...him. The one none of them spoke of. The one that they all knew was behind it, no matter what Lord Jarid said. &gt; &gt;Bayrd stood up. He’d want to do more smoothing later, but the spearhead actually looked pretty good. He raised his wooden spear haft—the metal blade had fallen free when evil had struck the camp—and lashed the new spearhead in place, just as his pappil had taught him all those years ago. &gt; &gt;The other guards were looking at him. “We’ll need more of those,” Morear said. “If you’re willing.” &gt; &gt;Bayrd nodded. “On our way out, we can stop by the hillside where I found the slate.” &gt; &gt;Jarid finally stopped yelling, his eyes wide in the torchlight. “No. You are my personal guard. You will not defy me!” &gt; &gt;Jarid jumped for Bayrd, murder in his eyes, but Morear and Rosse caught the lord from behind. Rosse looked aghast at his own mutinous act, panic on his wide face. He didn’t let go, though. &gt; &gt;Bayrd fished a few things out from beside his bedroll. After that, he nodded to the others, and they joined him—eight men of Lord Jarid’s personal guard, dragging the sputtering lord himself through the remnants of camp. They passed smoldering fires and fallen tents, abandoned by men who were trailing out into the darkness in greater numbers now, heading north. Into the wind. &gt; &gt;At the edge of camp, Bayrd selected a nice, stout tree. He waved to the others, and they took the rope he’d fetched and tied Lord Jarid to the tree. The man sputtered until Morear gagged him with a handkerchief. &gt; &gt;Bayrd stepped in close. He tucked a waterskin into the crook of Jarid’s arm. “Don’t struggle too much or you’ll drop that, my lord. You should be able to push the gag off—it doesn’t look too tight—and angle the waterskin up to drink. Here, I’ll take off the cap.” &gt; &gt;Jarid stared thunder at Bayrd. &gt; &gt;“It’s not about you, my Lord,” Bayrd said. “You always treated my family well. But, here, we can’t have you following along and making life difficult. There’s just something that we need to do, and you’re stopping everyone from doing it. That isn’t right; I guess this isn’t either. Maybe someone should have said something earlier. Well, that’s done. Sometimes, you let the meat hang too long, and the entire haunch has to go. It’s just the way of things.” &gt; &gt;He nodded to the others, who ran off to gather things. He pointed Rosse toward the slate outcropping, which was nearby, and told him what to look for in good spearhead stone. &gt; &gt;He turned back to the struggling Lord Jarid. “This isn’t witches, my Lord. This isn’t Elayne...I suppose I should call her the queen. Funny, thinking of a pretty young thing like that as queen. I’d rather have bounced her on my knee at an inn than bow to her, but Andor will need a ruler to follow to the Last Battle, and it isn’t your wife. We can’t fight anymore. I’m sorry.” &gt; &gt;Jarid sagged in his bonds, the anger seeming to bleed from him. He was weeping now. Odd thing to see, that. &gt; &gt;“I’ll tell people we pass—if we pass any—where you are,” Bayrd promised, “and that you probably have some jewels on you. They might come for you. They might.” He hesitated. “You shouldn’t have stood in the way. Everyone seems to know what is coming but you. The Dragon is reborn, old bonds are broken, old oaths done away with...and I’ll be hanged before I let Andor march to the Last Battle without me.” &gt; &gt;Bayrd left, walking into the night, raising his new spear onto his shoulder. I have an oath older than the one to your family, anyway. An oath the Dragon himself couldn’t undo. It was an oath to the land. The stones were in his blood, and his blood in the stones of this Andor. &gt; &gt;Bayrd gathered the others and they left for the north. Behind them in the night, their lord whimpered, alone, as the ghosts began to move through camp. &gt; &gt; &gt;A Memory of Light copyright © 2012 by The Bandersnatch Group, Inc.",43616,32868,0,0,1,1,©

Intel VT-d can help end users improve security and reliability of the systems and also improve performance of I/O devices in virtualized environment.

You can't criticize him!"". I respect Tastless, &amp; I'm sure everyone here who is criticizing him respects him immensely! The thing is, he is *not* casting well, at least not nearly as well as he used to. We all know he is capable of being awesome. It's just that for some reason he is not. It's obvious that he doesn't know much about the game &amp; the recent metagame. He doesn't seem to play, even know maps &amp; stats, unit buffs, &amp; recent patches.   It's like his brain is stuck with the same mind frame as the early seasons. Every time he is asked (because, let's face it he rarely takes the initiative) about maps, he quotes maps from the first seasons. Every time they talk about units, he says something like: ""I don't know what the do now I know they were buffed/nerfed, I remember they used to do X. Even when they talk about builds, he doesn't know any modern builds (other than 1/1/1). I know he is supposed to be the play by play &amp; he is not supposed to be the one that gets into the strats &amp; builds, but he needs the bare minimum. Artosis needs someone to talk with, that understands &amp; builds off of what he says. The worst part is he really seems (&amp; I know it's cliché) to have lost his ~~passion~~ interest for the game. Like at the end of a game, he just repeats what happened. The thing is, Artosis wants to talk about the game &amp; he does, but every time he is stalls, all he gets from tasteless is the same old stuff like: ""Yeah you're totally right""/""Yeah I've just got nerd chills watching that""/""X really played well"" etc etc... &amp; then waits for the commercial.  The recent Artosis/wolf-Artosis/khaldor casts have made this painfully obvious. Artosis seems 100% more enthusiastic when he is casting with wolf/khaldor than with Tasteless &amp; that's without the awesome chemistry Tastosis has.

t5_2rz1w,Red_player,1335547706,"It's good that you're speedling expanding. I wouldn't recommend the gasless styles until you are at least in mid platinum. You simply can't rely on your opponents knowing what they are doing/going for FFE. I'll try to walk you through a speedling expand build I've been working on recently. I'll warn you that zvp is my worst matchup too though. :q  Wall of text incoming!  ---  Do a speedling expand (meaning get your gas and pool before expanding. I don't care about specific timings.).  **Dronescout at 14 supply**. Depending on what you see, (FFE or not), you're going to be doing one of 2 builds.  **If you scout him going FFE** with your dronescout, pull guys off gas at 100. Delay your second queen until your natural is up, take a third and drone to 7:00. At 7:00, make a roach warren, evo, 2 gas, and put guys back into your first gas. (it's ok to do this step earlier if you see him chronoboost his cybercore a lot)  **Scouting the followup to his FFE**: Check when he takes his gas in the natural. The more he takes, and the earlier he gets them, the more likely he is to do a tech heavy play like Stargates, DTs or blink stalkers.  Send an overlord scout into his main at around 7 minutes to see if he's making a lot of gateways (4+). If you don't see any gateways you know he's not doing any big gateway plays, and you should prepare for DTs or Stargates, unless you actually see him going for something else a robo.  ---  **If your dronescout sees a gateway and a cybercore.** Use your lings to find out what unit he makes after the zealot. If it's a stalker or another zealot, he is saving his gas for something else. Sac an overlord immediately to find out what. Also check for chronoboost on the cybercore, as that means a likely 4gate.  (To defend a 4 gate, you shouldn't go above 23 drones. Make some spines and pump lings like your life depended on it, because it does. Getting a roach warren doesn't hurt either.)  His expansion should be up by 6:30. If it isn't, you should *really* worry one base shenanigans. (I like making a round of lings at 30 supply if I'm not sure he is expanding. If he is, you can probably snipe a few sentries, and if he isn't, you just keep making lings.)  I like taking my third whenever I see him expanding. I think that is a good heuristic to follow, but others might disagree.  Poke into his natural every once in a while to check his army composition. Lots of sentries=low tech and probably defensive. If he's starting to make a lot of zealots and stalkers, you should prepare for an attack. If his sentry count was never very high to begin with, you should worry about some kind of tech. Again, send in an overlord at ~7:00.  You probably want to get your roach warren and upgrades a few minutes earlier against gateway expands, but I'm not sure about exact timings. Honestly, it's been a while since I played against a gateway expo. :s  ---  I'm a diamond player, so obviously you should take what I'm saying with a grain of salt. Anyways, I hope this helps.

t5_2qh2p,boywithumbrella,1335576401,"&gt; OK, good: now look at the progress you've made.   Well, for one I made you go from indirectly implying we are idiots (""This *really* is not that hard to understand, people"") to outright swearing (""the *fucking conversation*""). Isn't that an achievement?   No, I do not think I committed non-sequitur in this conversation. Reason for that, first and foremost, is that I do not agree with you that the discussion you cut into is meaningless - that is only your opinion, which probably arises from the fact that you don't find the topic interesting. I tried pointing that out, but it apparently wasn't direct enough.   So I'll reiterate.   &gt; foster precise thinking   is what I very much want. However when I hear ""Semantics is just irritating"", or you suggesting ""If you think of the rainbow [this]... If you think of the rainbow [that]"" - that's where I see, that precise reasoning is definitely *not* taking place. For however irritating you might find it, but you use words to express yourself. Those words have meaning. What meaning that is and how you use it is semantics. Whether you like it or not, what you say is semantically loaded, and I can and will point out to you if I find you're wrong or I disagree with you. So, let's get to semantics.   Now if you would look up the word ""rainbow"" in a dictionary, the first (literal) definition of that word will be something along the lines of   &gt; rainbow |ˈreɪnbəʊ| (noun) an arch of colours visible in the sky, caused by the refraction and dispersion of the sun's light by rain or other water droplets in the atmosphere. The colours of the rainbow are generally said to be red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet.   [in this case it's Oxford Dictionary of English 3rd edition © 2010]   Now you'll see that the main definition of the word 'rainbow' will start with it being a visible arch. Most probably it will also be mentioned of what colours the rainbow consists. At this point (if thinking precisely) you should ask yourself - does the physical phenomenon it's describing only manifest in the form an arch? Does it consist of only the colours mentioned?   No, no it doesn't. What does is our perception of it. And the word for that perception is 'rainbow'. Quod erat demonstrandum ^( since you're so fond of latin )  Lastly,   &gt; a meaningful discussion of the underlying concepts.   if you want to discuss the underlying physical concepts of rainbow - why don't you go to r/AskScience instead? I really don't think it is more suited for r/atheism than semantics of perception.   .  post scriptum ^( hey look! more latin )   &gt; I'm the only one who's made a relevant point not asserted in the first two or three comments.   I get it, you need to prove yourself - and you did make a (valid) contribution, congratulations on that! But you have to understand, that even if you have the knowledge in the field of natural sciences to direct us ignorant people, not everybody does - and so we have to resort to humanitarian discussions instead, until you come along and enlighten us that what we're talking about is utterly meaningless. Forgive us, for we know not what we do... ",16780,1647,0,0,1,1,©

t5_2qh2p,Geohump,1335651650,"former religious college attendee here, I have to disagree. The atheists are not being hypocrites when they pick out offensive Scriptures from the Bible to recite to Christians.  According to the Christians, God is perfect, and the Bible is the perfect word of God. Therefore there can be no errors, no mistakes, no imperfections in the Bible. When atheists pick out so much as one clearly false statement or line etc. in the Bible they are effectively voiding all claim to inerrancy of the Bible. And if the Bible is not inerrant, then it cannot be the word of God. If the Bible is not the word of God, then all the fundamentalist Christians, who are the mental equivalent of the fundamentalist Muslim jihadis, (who had a few hundred more years to become less violent, note what were Christian fundamentalist doing 300 to 400 years ago?), must give up their claims that the ""word of God"" (""the Bible"") must be followed explicitly.  So, when atheists produce these ""offensive statements"" by cherry picking from the Gospels or the Old Testament, or any part of the Bible, they are effectively poking holes in, and totally voiding, claims that the Bible is the word of God, which effectively destroys all all claims of Christian fundamentalists.  Note to fundamentalists: if any single part of something that is alleged to be perfect and be demonstrated to not be perfect or not be true, then the entire body of that which was alleged to be perfect, is corrupted and false.  At every point in human history, wherever there have been fundamentalists of any religion, they always turned out to be extremists, and they always turned out to be evil. If you are a fundamentalist Christian, you are an agent of Satan, not one of God's servants. Please read Revelations and find the verses of Scripture that say that the stars in the sky will fall to earth. Now go find an astronomy textbook, or even look in Wikipedia, and look up the weight of the sun, and the weight of the earth. It is not even remotely possible for any star much less all the stars in the sky, to ""fall"" to earth. Should any single star get anywhere near the Earth, it will shred the earth to bits just from the title forces before the to get anywhere near each other, and the disintegrating bits of the earth be sucked into the gravity field of the sun, and into the sun's body. Anything great science student with an interest in astronomy will tell you about this. Now imagine the several hundred million stars in the sky trying to get anywhere near the Earth at the same time. Earth's sun is rather tiny by galactic standards. There are stars out there in the galaxy that are larger than Earth's orbit around our sun. In other words if one of these stars I mentioned were placed in the position of our current Sun, the star would completely fill up the space inside the orbit of the earth. They are that big.  By the way this kind of information is elementary school science. here's one of the larger stars that we have discovered so far:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VY_Canis_Majoris   It is thought to be about 2000 times the size of our sun. Earth's orbit is 93,000,000 miles. This star is 870,000,000 miles in diameter, or almost 10 times wider than the Earth's orbit.  I find that particular script in Revelations to be quite a revelation.  http://bible.cc/revelation/6-13.htm    King James Bible (Cambridge Ed.) And the stars of heaven fell unto the earth,  New International Version (©1984) and the stars in the sky fell to earth  King James 2000 Bible (©2003) And the stars of heaven fell unto the earth ",57307,1418,0,0,1,1,©
t5_2r2jt,cleos,1335652958,"That was one study that I cited - that's not what the basis of ""there's no such thing as PMS"" is. On the second post, I cited another study that look at menstrual cycles and mood cycles and compared the moods of men, ovulating women, and nonovulating women (women using birth control) - all three groups demonstrated mood patterns, but the three groups were all similar. In another post, I cite (although without full citations, as that required me to flip to the back of the book and write them down) an additionally four studies relating to PMS (if you search for the name, year, and related key words you'll probably come up with it). It's not wise to look only at hormone-related studies for a wide range of reasons, in part because when hormone differences are found, their effects are usually quite small and, while statistically significant, are not always clinically so - and often moderated by social and psychological variables.  However, I went on ebsco and did a search for testosterone, menstrual cycle, and irritability:  &gt; Dougherty, D. M., Bjork, J. M., Moeller, F., &amp; Swann, A. C. (1997). The influence of menstrual-cycle phase on the relationship between testosterone and aggression. Physiology &amp; Behavior, 62(2), 431-435. doi:10.1016/S0031-9384(97)88991-  Plasma testosterone (T) and aggressive behavior were measured in 12 women (aged 18–39 yrs) with and without perimenstrual affective symptomatology (e.g., depression, irritability) during the menstrual, midfollicular, ovulatory, and premenstrual phases of the menstrual cycle. The Point Subtraction Aggression Paradigm© was used to quantify aggression. Ss had 2 response options: a point-maintained option (100 presses earned a point worth 10 cents) and an aggressive response option (10 presses ostensibly subtracted a point from a fictitious partner's counter). Ss were provoked by the periodic subtraction of a point that was attributed to the responding of a fictitious opponent. Although T increased during the ovulatory phase, aggressive response to provocation remained unchanged across the menstrual cycle. T did not differ between groups during any phase. A relationship between T and use of the aggressive response option was seen only during the midfollicular phase. These data suggest that the relationship in females between endogenous T and aggression is inconsistent, that self-report of perimenstrual symptomatology is a more consistent predictor of aggression across the menstrual cycle than is T, and that perimenstrual emotional symptomatology is not related to T levels.  The following study was conducted in Sweden:  Eriksson, E., Sundblad, C., Lisjö, P., &amp; Modigh, K. (1992). Serum levels of androgens are higher in women with premenstrual irritability and dysphoria than in controls. Psychoneuroendocrinology, 17(2-3), 195-204. doi:10.1016/0306-4530(92)90058-F  Serum levels of progesterone, total testosterone, free testosterone, androstendione, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate, 17-OH-progesterone (17-OHP), and sex hormone binding globulin were measured in the follicular phase, around ovulation, and in the luteal phase of 11 women with severe premenstrual irritability and dysphoria (PID) and in 11 age-matched controls with no premenstrual complaints. Serum levels of free testosterone were significantly higher in the Ss with premenstrual syndrome (PMS) than in the controls in the luteal phase, the follicular phase, and around ovulation. DHEA levels were significantly higher in the PMS Ss, as compared to controls, around ovulation, while 17-OHP levels were higher in the PMS women in the luteal phase. Androgens may be involved in the pathophysiology of PID  However, it's important to note that correlation does not equal causation, meaning that it could be the androgen change that leads to irritability, or it could be irritability that leads to the change in androgens. For example, in [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rtkte/iama_former_transgender_individual_who/c48y8aj) post I mention how hormones can be influenced by behaviors.

t5_2txom,cabbagery,1335678704,"It seems to me that the 'purpose' of academic discussion is in line with the relentless pursuit of knowledge/truth. I see three emergent scenarios:  1. Those who have [access to] knowledge and/or truth provide it to those who do not. 2. Those who do not have [access to] knowledge and/or truth seek it from those who do. 3. Those who recognize that their own knowledge is limited seek to increase it.  As it turns out, every academic falls into category (3). Academic discussions, therefore, can satisfy up to two of the above *from every perspective*. This makes them highly efficient means of furthering the relentless pursuit of knowledge/truth, and presumably the most efficient means available at present.  More broadly, in the spirit of your own answer, I would say that in order to have an academic interest in a [particularly narrow] field, a person must first have some level of knowledge or interest in that field, which must meet some minimum threshold. To be interested in becoming a cardiologist, for example, a person must first have some available knowledge of anatomy and physiology. In some cases, a cursory familiarity will suffice, whereas in others it won't. It's hard to see how a person could think to become a Lego® Master Builder (yes, it's a real occupation) without first knowing that such a thing was even *possible*. Surely there are scientific fields which are sufficiently narrow in focus as to be analogous to the non-academic role of Master Builders (I struggle to think of any, but that's presumably because I'm sufficiently well-educated that I am minimally familiar with most fields).  This is all to say that education is crucial. It is the very thing which makes academic pursuits *possible*. If we value academic discussion, then we must value education, and if we truly desire to have the pursuit of knowledge/truth actually be *relentless*, then we must encourage education for *all humans*. This last claim falls nicely in line with the recognition that all academics fall into category (3) from above -- not only does every proper academic recognize that her knowledge is limited, but she recognizes that every other human stands a reasonable chance of increasing her knowledge, provided that they receive an education such that the possibility exists.",24679,785,0,0,1,1,®
