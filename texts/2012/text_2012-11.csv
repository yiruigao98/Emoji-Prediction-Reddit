t5_2qh1o,ErrantWhimsy,1351728068,"Here is our official fact sheet about these two.    About Berani and Dumai   **Berani**  What is he? A Malayan tiger ( Panthera tigris jacksoni). Native to Penisular Malaysia. Only an estimated 500 remain in the wild. There are 55 Malayan tigers in Association of Zoos &amp; Aquariums accredited zoos in North America.  Name: Berani (pronounced Burr-ani) means “brave” in Malay; he was named by the veterinary staff at Tulsa Zoo.   Born:  Aug. 26 at Tulsa Zoo.  Birth weight:  Approximately 2.5 pounds  Current weight: 12 pounds, 15 ounces.  Parents:  Mother, Jin, 4; father Gahara, 7.   His litter: He was a single birth.   Why is he being hand-reared? He was not getting enough milk and his mother was inattentive, Tulsa Zoo veterinarians said.   Why is he coming to Point Defiance Zoo &amp; Aquarium? It’s best for hand-reared tigers to be raised together. They’ll acquire tiger behaviors from one another and learn to socialize and  behave in an appropriate way with humans and other tigers in zoo-based populations.  How different are Malayan tiger Berani and Sumatran tiger Dumai?   Malayan tigers are a bit bigger, lighter in color and lankier in body formation. They are native to the tropical forests of Peninsular Malaysia. The Tiger Conservation Campaign estimates that fewer than 500 remain in the wild.  ·         Sumatran tigers are the smallest subspecies of tiger. Their fur is a darker orange than that of Malayans. They are also the only remaining tiger subspecies that lives on an island.  They are critically endangered, and as few as 300 live in the wild.   **Dumai**  What is he? A Sumatran tiger (Panthera tigris sumatrae). Native to the Indonesian island of Sumatra. There are 74 Sumatran tigers in Association of Zoos &amp; Aquariums accredited zoos in North America and about 375 as part of the Global Species Management Plan. Only an estimated 300 remain in the wild.  Name: Dumai (pronounced doo-my). Dumai is a city in the Sumatran province of Riau. Members of the public picked Dumai in an online survey of six names submitted by members of the Asian Forest Sanctuary staff who care for the cub.  Born:  Aug. 22 at Point Defiance Zoo &amp; Aquarium.    Birth weight:  Approximately 3 pounds.  Current weight: 14.2 pounds – a 425 percent gain since birth.  Parents:  Mother, Jaya, 9; father, Malosi, 4.  His litter: He was a single birth.   Why is he being hand-reared? Zoological staff and veterinarians decided to separate him from his mother when it was clear that intervention was crucial for his health. Within days of his birth, he was not getting enough milk, was dehydrated and his temperature was low. He is now thriving.   **General questions about the tigers**  *Is it rare for two subspecies to be reared together?* Yes. It’s not common, but it does occasionally happen.   *What do they eat?* Each of the cubs is fed a special formula designed to give him the nutrients he needs to thrive and grow. Their teeth are coming in, and they also are beginning to eat a type of ground meat.  *How long will they be hand-reared?*  It depends on the tigers’ growth and the zoological staff. Zookeepers will know when the tigers are big enough to thrive without round-the-clock attention. That likely will be when they are 4 to 6 months old and weigh around 100 pounds.  *How long will they live in the Cub Den?*  Until they outgrow it. Then, they’ll be shifted to the Day Room in the Asian Forest Sanctuary.  *How big will they get?* Each may reach 275-300 pounds when fully grown.  *Will Dumai return to Jaya or Berani to his mother at Tulsa Zoo?* No. The two cubs will remain together as “brothers” as they are cared for and shifted onto exhibit at Point Defiance Zoo &amp; Aquarium.  *How long will they stay at Point Defiance Zoo &amp; Aquarium?* That decision is up to Species Survival Plan® officials. Typically, they remain at their home zoos until they are sexually mature, which occurs at about age 3. Then, a decision is made about where to place them for breeding purposes to increase their numbers and maintain genetic diversity in the subspecies. Berani will eventually be mated with a Malayan tiger; Dumai with another Sumatran.   *Do other zoos have Malayan and Sumatran tigers:* Yes, but only two other zoos in the United States – Dallas Zoo and San Diego Zoo – have both.   *What are the threats to tigers in the wild?* Poaching and habitat loss due to human encroachment on their native lands.   *How can people learn more about the tigers?* Go to pdza.org for information on tiger conservation, awareness and fundraising efforts.",®

t5_2qh2p,Dudesan,1351729215,"I've heard many christians claim that there's a distinction between ""moral, civil, and ceremonial laws"", but not one has ever been able to give me a straight answer about how they tell the difference between the three. It's clearly about what they find personally distasteful or silly, but admitting that that was the case would rather undermine their positions, so don't expect them to admit it. Apart from a few commands which were explicitly intended for a specific people at a specific time, there is absolutely nothing to indicate that most of these laws weren't supposed to be binding for everyone for all time. Indeed, in many places (See Leviticus 23:21, for example), it's explicitly stated that they *are*.  Remember, many Christians find it more comfortable to believe in a god who doesn't condone, command or commit murder, slavery, rape, child abuse, animal abuse, arson, torture, ritual mutilation, fratricide, patricide, matricide, infanticide, genocide, and so on than to believe in one who does. Unfortunately, since the Bible (Old Testamant and New) is pretty clear about Yahweh's position on these things, holding a belief in Loving Hippie Jesus™ requires ignoring huge portions of it. Or just never reading it in the first place, which seems to be the most popular option.  Well, let's see what Jesus has to say about that:  &gt;“Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished.  (Matthew 5:17-18, NIV)  Some Christians claim that his death and resurrection ""fulfill"" this. That is bullshit for one simple reason: last time I checked, Heaven and Earth haven't passed away.  Jesus also made his views on people ""picking and choosing"" quite clear:  &gt;[Jesus] answered them, “And why do you break God’s commandment because of your tradition? For God said:    *Honor your father and your mother;* and, *The one who speaks evil of father or mother must be put to death.*  &gt; But you say, ‘Whoever tells his father or mother, “Whatever benefit you might have received from me is a gift committed to the temple”—  he does not have to honor his father.’ In this way, you have revoked God’s word because of your tradition. Hypocrites! Isaiah prophesied correctly about you when he said:    &gt;These people honor Me with their lips, but their heart is far from Me.  They worship Me in vain, teaching as doctrines the commands of men.”  (Matthew 15:3-9, NIV)   Looks like Jesus has quite a bit to say about people who ignore commandments, in fact. But maybe it's just Matthew?  &gt;It is easier for heaven and earth to disappear than for the least stroke of a pen to drop out of the Law.  (Luke 16:17, NIV)  Okay, so Jesus is a bust. Let's see what the Epistles have to say about the Mosaic Code:  &gt; If you really keep the royal law found in Scripture, “Love your neighbor as yourself,” you are doing right.  But if you show favoritism, you sin and are convicted by the law as lawbreakers. For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it.   (James 2:8-10, NIV)  &gt;All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness,  (2 Timothy 3:16)  &gt;Do we, then, nullify the law by this faith? Not at all! Rather, we uphold the law.  (Romans 3:31)  &gt;Know this first of all, that *there is no prophecy of scripture that is a matter of personal interpretation*, for no prophecy ever came through human will; but rather human beings moved by the holy Spirit spoke under the influence of God.""  (2 Peter 1:20-21 NAB) ",™

t5_2qh5j,nobody25864,1351759141,"TL;DR  &gt;That's assuming centralizing information is impossible.  No, it's assuming you don't have any price information on the means of production, which we've both agreed you don't, and therefore cannot tell if you're profiting from your actions.  Let me borrow an example from something I read once:  Let's look a bit more at how things work in a free market. Mr A is a successful businessman. He comes up with a great new idea, say laptops that glow in the dark. He does his market research, and finds that customers will pay an extra 50 bucks for a glow-in-the-dark laptop. [Yes, I am making this all up, and I'm going to make up all the prices involved, too.]  So he opens up his catalogue of Shines in the Dark Plastics, and he is very surprised to find that that stuff is pricey. In fact, it will cost him 60 bucks per laptop to coat them. He will not make any more money on those planned shine-in-the-dark laptops, in fact he will lose 10 bucks per laptop.  Not wanting his dream of great fortune to go up in smoke, he calls up Mr B, CEO of Shines in the Dark Plastics, and asks him for a discount. ""I can't do it,"" says Mr B. Mr C is buying up all my stuff like there's no tomorrow, and paying full price. So he's going to get it all, unless you outbid him. I certainly can't give you a discount.""  Intrigued at this point, Mr A calls up Mr C. ""How can you possibly afford to pay B's outrageous prices for his Shine in the Dark Plastic™?""  ""Simple,"" says C. ""I make glow in the dark skeletons, and people love them. Every Halloween they pay a cool hundred bucks per skeleton. Sixty bucks for the plastic, a few more for other expenses, and I make about twenty dollars a skeleton. And it's become a tradition to buy a new skeleton every year. I'm a rich man.""  Mr A hangs up indignantly, and decides to move to a Socialist country, where he thinks he might have better luck. Comrade Marx, leader of the country, welcomes the talented and experienced Mr A with open arms, and appoints him head of a newly opened laptop factory, with carte blanche to do as he pleases.  ""This is more like it,"" says Mr A, rubbing his hands together. ""To each according to his needs. Well, my factory needs some Glow in the Dark Plastic, and Comrade Plastic, who runs the factory that makes the stuff, has agreed to give me as much as I want.""  The glow-in-the-dark laptops hit the shelves. People are pretty pleased with the cute little novelty laptops, which sell at a very reasonable price, until Halloween comes around. They go to their shops to get some skeletons, but there are none on the shelves. When word leaks out about what happened, that all the plastic went to coating their laptops, they go home disappointed, cursing their stupid laptops, and look yearningly over the border at Freemarketville's homes, all gloriously decorated with shiny, scary, skeletons.  You see what happened. The free market, with its price system, made sure that the shiny plastic was used for what people wanted most. The Socialist country, by contrast, had no clue about how to use its supply of glow-in-the-dark plastic.  Of course, this story is not just about novelty plastic. The exact same thing will happen to all the resources at the Socialist country's disposal. Lacking a price system, they will have absolutely no idea how best to use them.

De finns de som gillar att hoppa mellan korta osäkra anställningar. Hon borde försöka att inte behöva arbetstrygghet. Staten kan inte gå in och anpassa samhället så att alla får arbetstrygghet. På samma sätt finns det människor som gillar flexibiliteten med andrahandsbostäder. Du kan säga upp lägenheten med en månads varsel och snabbt flytta till ny ort där ett nytt vikariat hägrar. Denna typ av flexibilitet och individens val är väldigt viktigt för många människor och det kan staten inte sätta sig över. Att försöka justera något som är kopplat till generella strukturer är absolut inte statens roll. Den ska blott hålla sig undan när den okuvliga individen springer livets gatlopp. /slut ironi",™

And think deep in your body. Try to remove tension. Don't ""pull"" it up.  If you are under age 21, alcohol does NOT help. Ever.  (are the children gone?)  Ok. I have used alcohol a few times for a performance or an audition. But the results I've found have been VERY inconsistant. What does help is making sure I'm not dried out, and that I'm in good voice with a good, muscle relaxing warm up.  A good massage also helps open stuff up. Love a massage when my voice is feeling weird.",®

t5_2qm4e,n3cr0,1351836535,"Basically the principal is that water evaporates (transpiration) mainly from the leaves at the top of the tree and the water is pulled through the dead cells that form a type of ""tube"" system leading up the tree.  I don't know for sure what the internal cell structure of this tree system looks like, but based on gravity and how the cells are typically structured in trees, I'd say that its more probable that this is the case.  I suppose it would be possible for it to be plumbed backwards and the water would flow up the right tree and then down the connecting branch/tissue and then up the left ... but that seems very unlikely since these pathways are build from one root structure up the trunk of a tree.  edit:  I didn't address the question.  Overall I would say the tree on the right is better off because the typical limiting factor in a forest like the one pictured is water.  Overall having access to more water would allow the tree to support more leaves (in reality more leaves would be required to maintain a certain level of water transmition to the air to keep the water flowing up) and so would then absorb more sunlight allowing it to convert more energy to nutrients and on and on.  Basically the advantage of pulling extra water without the added time required adding the girth to the trunk would be a great leg up.  That being said, I'm going off a single picture, could be completely off ☺",☺

One I can consider my closest friend, we've talked nearly daily for like 6 years though we live in different states. We've met like twice and he's freaking awesome and talented! It doesn't even feel like it was that long ago. We've supported each other and vented when we need to. :)  Another is a friend from like '04, ""Alex"", from Kazakhstan. We're not close, we don't know what each other look like but we talk whenever we're online. He refuses to use the internet for anything beside AIM /youtube anymore so it's always great to hear from him! He's aged so much, it's scary. He wants to be a history professor and goes on tangents a bout middle eastern history; pretty neat stuff. I don't remember where we met.   There's a clique of friends in michigan that I still talk to regularly, I think I met one through 4chan because he and his friend (on gaia) were trolling me on the forums. Not sure how exactly we all got acquainted but it feels like I'm a part of their social circle. With one friend in particular that I was Skyping with... he was talking about proposing to her. She came online a few days later flipping out and showing me her ring. &lt;3 One of his friends comes online at random to have me tell him bedtime stories too. &gt;.&gt;   2 from 4chan: somebody posted my address on 4chan with all my details including screen names so I got messages on AIM / ICQ with trolls. 2 in particular were warning me and helping me out while I was flipping out. They're never online anymore but I get texts occasionally when they have phone service.  There's also a group of my friend, my ex, and my friends ex. We'd game together, we'd skype together, we'd raid together, and just chill and talk. We were all pretty close for a few years. I talk to them individually once in a blue moon now, they both hate my ex, my friend just had his first baby, and the other chick and I text. They play LoL occasionally, though I can never join anymore.   Most recent ones have been  homies from g+ ♥♥ though i've been so caught up in school that i feel like a butthole for never joining hangouts anymore.

t5_2ss5b,captain_sourpuss,1351863356,"Thank you for your reply. Now I just want to work with you to figure out why you are offended. Are you sure offense at my comparison is the right reaction? I'm not trying to talk down here, but what many people miss is that the outrage people have over a human being raped should be felt by humans learning about how animals are being treated too.  I'm still not saying both cases are equal, I am saying that we don't need to even figure out how close they are, I am saying, and I believe showing that both issues are **offensive enough** to be demand that they are addressed - now rape actually is harder to stop since you will always have psychotic or antisocial people, eating meat is trivial to stop. All that is needed is putting down the knife.  As for your points  Milking&gt; One of the ways to argue a point is to quote someone from the opposite camp. I might be biased, some 'veggie magazine' might be biased. But let's hear it from a company producing milking machines: http://www.copulsation.com/humane.htm - ""*The CoPulsation™ Milking System is the only humane way to milk a cow*"" - great. So there might be a solution (its actually a bit disputed that this system works). Sadly this new technology has a minute market share and according to the milking industry's journals the US alone has a $2 billion loss per year with milk having more than the allowed amount of pus due  to mastitis (an eyedropper of pus per litre, I believe, is allowed. Yum.).  Held up when being stunned&gt; Again, lets see what the pro-meat industry shows us. A tiny fragment out of 'Our Daily Bread, a video *sponsored* by the meat industry. This, again, is as good as it gets.  [cow gets killed](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JxvG67w864#t=1h23m) - note how the cow's head isn't held down at all, how often do you think an unlucky cow will have moved its head at an 'inconvenient' time? Of course this 'stunning' went perfectly, it's a promotional video, but do you think the cow looks chilled out before it gets shot? Yeah.. this goes wrong a lot. And even if it goes wrong only once every 10 cows.. that is a horrible death for 15 million cows a year.  Your own words already betray you, it is hard to deny that I'm actually painting the most optimistic, yet realistic picture of how animals are treated. This is why I 'love' the example so, it is actually VERY hard to disprove. I'm not showing you the dreaded animal torture videos from factory farms, it's easy to claim they are an exception. This is the best cows get and it is *horrible*. Of course we can all dream about some hypothetical happy farm where everything is perfect, and if that ever gets achieved we can discuss 'humane meat' again, but right now, eating meat is directly supporting the largest amount of suffering in our world. The only question that remains is if for some reason animals suffering does not count, we can do whatever we want with them. Is this your point? Animals are property and whatever we want, no matter how cruel, is fine? Purely for our pleasure?  So. Let's talk again about ridiculous. WHY are you ridiculing it? Because ""everybody knows that... ""? Fuck that, you just never have never thought about it. Most people haven't, it's not a crime to be ignorant, but it is a crime to STAY ignorant now you are hearing the other side. Read up. Try to actually disprove what I'm saying. Or are you more comfortable just plugging your ears and going 'la la la la I cant hear you'?  ps. so you can't say I'm ignoring points.  Pointy teeth (aka 'canines'): [vegetarian](http://images.nationalgeographic.com/wpf/media-live/photos/000/005/cache/giant-panda_543_600x450.jpg) [vegetarian](http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01412/Gorilla-eating_1412804i.jpg) (mostly, sometimes some ants)  [vegetarian](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/Tufteddeer-2.jpg/428px-Tufteddeer-2.jpg) - plus it's a bullshit argument anyway. Even IF the teeth were 'made for meat', it is completely undisputed that you can eat a healthy plant-based diet without significant effort so there is no NEED to kill animals to survive. That is history perhaps, but saying something is OK because it USED TO be true is idiotic. They said the earth was flat. Everybody thought so. Are you going to take me serious if I jump up and down demanding that it is still true because we USED to think so?   Your arguments are failing all around you. All you have left is your selfish 'suffering and death tastes nice'. Do you think people will look at you kindly if this is your explanation for why you are directly responsible for it? Do you think YOU deserve being treated kindly when you are the one without power or a voice? ",™

You can't whistle unless you find high cover and lean around the corner. Some things are impassable and opaque but don't block line of sight. Oh, and Connor constantly glitches on top of objects and alerts guards.   And contextual controls - fuck right off with that. When a stealth sequence consists of your character doing something completely boneheaded, with you staring at your controller thinking ""what the fuck"" every 5 minutes, that's a problem. Trying to run by guards to rip off a poster, or you just disarmed a guard and want to pick up their weapon (why don't you just grab their weapon in the first place)? Too bad, contextual controls means you're in combat, and all the B button does it make you wave your hand around in counter stance. I actually miss the whole thing where you had to draw a weapon to be considered ""in combat"".  Awesome things:  Dogs. Board games.

This is a do-it-yourself guide: call or internet if you can, but ultimately just go. Also, we're running regular event listings below the volunteer opportunities, not because we're trying to pretend that everything is fine -- like certain fucking marathons -- but because after you've spent the day washing out muck water or running up stairs, dancing feels double good.  * Red Hook: Volunteers needed today at to cook food and coordinate aid. 767 Hicks Street, Brooklyn.

t5_2ss5b,Sylocat,1351885779,"Ironically, there is a simple, effective and easy way to fight SRS, if only the ASRS/SRSS crowd would pull their heads out of their asses long enough to see it.  Namely, don't let SRS be the only viable option for feminists on Reddit.  Don't get so wrapped up defining yourself by your opposition to SRS that you wind up defending actual bigotry just by extension of your defense of the innocent. Don't let SRS be the only ones to call the worst of it out. If SRS is the only one addressing the big problems, then their jumping on false positives makes them look right too. Their judgment looks better, by comparison, to people who actually care about social justice issues but aren't necessarily Social Justice Warriors™, so they have no other flag to rally around.  If enough of us banded together and provided an actual legitimate alternative, the Fempire would be hobbled instantly, and everyone would be happier. But no, apparently it's more fun to post and upvote sexist and racist insults, *allegedly* just because we want to offend a group of people who draw their power from being offended (and not just because we actually agree with them and just want to use, ""Why are you calling me out?

t5_2qh96,Girlwithnousername,1351897328,"Sorry for the length of this reply, I’ve been going to gigs for a very long time.  1. Be prepared for talkers. You get people who want to chat to their mates at almost every gig. Either accept it, or try to stand halfway up on the sides or nearer the front to avoid them. The majority of talkers are usually late arrivals and generally stand towards the back (very generally, they do infiltrate crowds everywhere!). Don't be afraid people to ask people to very politely be quiet if it's a really special song for you, say, played at a really low volume or acoustic. You'll usually get a glare or maybe a 'how rude' reply, but most people do then quieten down if asked politely enough.   2. People will push in front of you to get to their friends with drinks, or just to get in front of you... You just have to sort of deal with it really. You probably should move to accommodate them unless you want beer spilt over you! It’s not a big thing though and you soon get used to it.  3. If you stand very close to the front you could get crushed/in a mosh pit/have people crowdsurfing over your head. This depends on the bands really, but I've seen people moshing at the front of middle-of-the-road indie bands who are playing songs that you’d think are impossible to mosh to (quite funny in hindsite).   4. Drinks (including water) at gig venues are usually twice what you'd pay in your local bar and the toilets, more often than not, are grotty and/or run out of toilet roll very quickly.  Or maybe this is just a UK thing.  5. There are good and bad places to stand at most gig venues. This can depend on many things: having a pillar in your way, the slope of the floor (or lack of slope, meaning everyone’s on the same level including really tall people), where the band come on stage, whether you’re on a path to the bar or the toilets or the exit. Don’t be afraid to experiment during the gig and move through the crowd to find the right place for you.  6. Exactly the same applies with sound. You can have a venue who have an excellent sound system in place, but if the band bring mediocre kit or if the soundman on the night isn’t very good, the sound can end up being below-par. So just find a place where the sound is good for you (but bear in mind that sound can change drastically between support and main acts due to differences in music genre and/or having their own different/better/louder kit – so good sound could suddenly become ear-popping).  7. The ‘doors’ time is often far off actual stage times. If you’re not at all bothered then just turn up for doors time stated. But if you’d rather not hang around waiting, call the venue and ask them what time the bands are on stage.  Here’s what I find in most venues: ‘doors’ state 7.30pm. The first support act actually comes on stage at 8pm. They’re done by around 8.30pm. It takes half an hour for a kit change and the main act is on stage at 9pm. Don’t take this as read (or is it red? I can never remember) though - it varies between venues.   8. If you are female, carry a handbag with as little as possible in it. You’ll be amazed at how heavy the most seemingly light handbag becomes after carrying it on one shoulder for four hours. Keep the bag close to you/take a bag that’s not easy for someone to get their hands inside. Also, wear sensible shoes.   9. I don’t know what applies outside the UK but here you can’t take your own drinks in, even water. You’ll be made to throw it away before entering the venue.   10. You can often find some pretty cool merchandise and beautifully hand-made cds at live gigs. Check out the merch table. Be prepared to pay a bit more than you’d usually expect to though. Merch sales are a really great way to further support smaller bands so I always check out the merch table and have come away with some absolutely beautiful items (there’s a lot of trash out there too though).  11. If you’re going to a huge venue, don’t be afraid to leave before the last song if you want to guarantee not having to queue for ages for the tube/bus/local train home. Most transport systems are efficient enough to handle the flow, but if you live pretty far out/are at risk of missing your connection, you do not HAVE to stay until the end!   12. Bearing the above in mind, if you do want to see every single song played, most bands do encores. Some even do two or three (I once saw one with four, which was absurd). The gig is not over until the lights come on, so don’t be mistaken into thinking that it’s over when they go off stage and many people start to leave. It’s ALWAYS when the lights come on!  13.  Use earplugs.  14. DON’T FORGET TO TAKE YOUR TICKET!  15.  Gigs are not a place to be self-conscience. Dance however you like and in whatever manner that best suits you; nobody around you will be paying the blindest bit of notice. But  - do dance. I believe it’s the law ☺  16. Enjoy. I hope you have a wonderful time and that you soon become a gig addict. ",☺

Family can't tell us a thing about her except that she's diabetic.  This registers little with me at the time.  As I'm putting an IV in her (complete with arm-bar, since she's so restless), she grips my arm, stares me in the eyes, and in a rare moment of clarity, says, ""I'm *starving*!"" then immediately goes back to her rapid, deep breathing.

t5_2s6lr,casualslacks,1351906882,"&gt;I've read that AoEs are more important in the early solo game  I'm building up the Gunslinger deck and I generally play solo. I find the attacks that chain/jump to multiple targets more effective and faster to cast than the various AOEs I have at my disposal. Although, it's worth noting that there are multiple types of AOEs.  &gt;Is there a way to respec or refund my points in case I do something stupid? The game is complex and I want to experiment but I'm afraid I will create extra work for myself if I don't have a plan.  No way to respec that I know of. You just keep adding points until you have all of the abilities. Hence, redoing quests. I decided to go after the Gunslinger deck just to avoid spending too much time thinking about it. I hate theorycrafting. The Devs have been talking about adding starter decks for a couple months just to give new players something to build towards. I imagine they'll put that out soon™.",™

Rhodiola Rosea is a mild MAO-B inhibitor, and has some minor stimulant effects. MAO-B reduces your body's ability to break down dopamine. The L-Tyrosine is converted in the brain to dopamine, and caffeine also increases dopamine activity. Concerta (methylphenidate) works by inhibiting dopamine reuptake, so the overall rise in dopamine activity due to the synergy between the supplement and your medication is probably at fault for at least the stimulation, if not also the nausea.  You're probably going to want to significantly reduce your concerta dose if you want to take the supplement at the same time.",®

The Nazi party didn't have hard boundaries, it was an idea, one shared by industrialists and financiers in the UK and America. Eugenics was implemented first in the US and arguably continues to this day if you look at the prison population. Fascism won and the situation could hardly have gone worse. We have been on the edge of nuclear war for a long time, and we have at least a few Russians to thank for it not happening. One incident involved three Russian subs off the coast of Cuba told that should all three commanders agree they could launch an attack. US boats started dropping depth charges and outside of radio they were under the orders that if they all agreed they could launch nukes. Two thought that war had started and wanted to launch, [Vasili Arkhipov](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasili_Arkhipov) said no. We have been that close an unknown number of times.  Remember what Germany did? They invaded about four countries before the war started, and the Jewish issue came at the end of the war and makes strange economic sense if it happened like we are lead to believe. What have America done? If we ignore the millions killed by direct US aggression and CIA backed coups, they are currently occupying Libya, Egypt, Iraq, Afghanistan, and are at low level clandestine war with Pakistan and Iran. Israel is an apartheid state. The UK is an accessory, whilst harbouring some of the more significant financial terrorists and money laundering systems. The middle east from being on a comparable level social progress to the west (health care, woman's rights, education, etc) was in large parts knocked back to the stone age. Africa has been a hideous mess when we think of past and present day South Africa. There has been all manner of genocidal events, and America's middle eastern war games seem to be heading south. Indonesia doesn't fare better.  In many ways the wars of the 20th century have yet to end because fascist authoritarian militantism still is here. And we see it at home with secret courts, corporate lobbying, failure to properly police high level crime including hacking, expenses, and now a pedophile ring that probably includes aristocracy if not royalty and high members of the church (previously ""isolated"" to Ireland, now Mainland UK). We are funding the coup in Syria, we give political support to Israel, we are probably the largest tax haven, and Cameron® is agitating for war with Iran.",®

For example: http://www.staples.com/Brother-Refurbished-EMFC-J6710DW-Inkjet-All-in-One-Printer/product_470646  With brother your cost per page will be lower, but I would get the super high end one to cover failure of the print head.

t5_2qi1h,ram1546,1351977571,"Libye : le consultat américain de Benghazi, succursale de la CIA ? terrorisme(979) - CIA(70) - Wall Street Journal(4) - Attaque de Benghazi(2)  02/11/2012 à 09h:38 Par Jeune Afrique         Un bâtiment du consulat américain de Benghazi (Libye), le 12 septembre 2012. © AFP Pris d’assaut par des éléments proches d’Al-Qaïda au Maghreb islamique (Aqmi), le 11 septembre dernier, le consulat de Benghazi abritait une mission secrète des services de renseignement américain (CIA), rapporte le Wall Street Journal, dans son édition du 2 novembre. Selon le Wall Street Journal, dans son édition du 2 novembre [Lien payant], le consulat de Benghazi qui avait été pris d’assaut par des éléments proches d’Al-Qaïda au Maghreb islamique (Aqmi), le 11 septembre dernier, n’abritait pas que des diplomates. Au contraire, d’après le quotidien, seuls sept des trente responsables américains évacués après l’attaque travaillaient pour le département d'État. Les autres auraient essentiellement été des membres des services de renseignement, la fameuse Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). L’assaut contre le consulat, le jour de la commémoration des dix ans des attentats du 11 Septembre 2002, s’était produit dans un climat international de manifestations antiaméricaines suite à la diffusion d’un film anti-islam sur la Toile. L’ambassadeur Christopher Stevens et trois autres personnes sont morts durant l’attaque, qui a provoqué une tempête politique aux États-Unis, en pleine campagne électorale pour la présidentielle du 6 novembre prochain. Discrétion Les républicains du candidat Mitt Romney reprochent en effet au président sortant Barack Obama de n’avoir pas su sécuriser de manière satisfaisante les installations diplomatiques américaines dans une ville particulièrement exposée aux actions violentes d’Aqmi. Mais si les effectifs de sécurité n’étaient pas pléthoriques, c’est peut-être surtout en vertu de la discrétion que souhaitait garder la mission diplomatique de Benghazi. De fait, le WSJ affirme que plus d'une vingtaine de membres de la CIA opéraient en secret dans un bâtiment annexe du consulat, où s'étaient retranchés des membres du personnel après une première attaque. Les deux agents de sécurité libyens tués le 11 septembre travaillaient d’ailleurs pour l’agence et non pour le département d’État. Communication Or ce seraient surtout des problèmes de communication entre la CIA et les diplomates américains qui pourraient expliquer les failles en matière de sécurité, explique le WSJ. Qui indique également que la mission secrète de la CIA avait été entamée peu après le début de la révolte anti-Kaddafi, en février 2011. Selon le journal, l’objectif était de lutter contre le terrorisme et de mettre la main sur les armes lourdes du régime.

t5_2qhu8,cinemashow,1352006886,"Correct...Sorta. The Hemispherical rules differ for IFR and VFR traffic. VFR traffic flies at even thousand altitudes +500 for Westerly headings. IFR traffic flies at the even thousand feet.( And the Odd thousand feet for easterly headings). Therefore the rules state that traffic should be separated by a vertical distance of 500 feet.   Also when in proximity of an uncontrolled airport, there may be four or five aircraft all in the same traffic pattern. The distances are very close. It can be stressful. There could be 2 a/c on the downwind leg separated by less than a mile one on base and one on final. And this is when everyone is following FAR/AIM uncontrolled airport procedure. Lotta cowboys out their making their own rules in a traffic pattern at an uncontrolled airport. Oh. I forgot to add to this scenario.  Ultralights are often doing their ultralight thing at non controlled airports. And nobody is required, by law anyway, to be using proper self announce intentions.    The biggest problem in a traffic pattern situation that would be seen by the FAA as a violation would be if two aircraft were on the active runway at the same time. That would be classified as a runway incursion. ie One aircraft had landed and was rolling and was at the far end of the runway, and one aircraft on final would just touch down.   Runway incursions have been a dominant feature in all of the FAA's safety briefings. Aircraft behavior on airport taxiways have been scrutinized and many rules are now in place over the past couple of years to prevent runaway incursions. The definition of a runway incursion has now included any two aircraft with any part of them on an active runway at the same time i.e. crossing over the departure hold short line while another aircraft is still on its landing rollout. Or one aircraft has not crossed over the hold short line while taxiing off the active rw while another ac is landing.    Fok! Please excuse my wayyyy toooo long reply. 😛",😛

He got a promotion to second in command of NASA, with the guarantee of becoming the boss when the current boss retired.

Central to the theme of these essays is that a genuinely nice male is desirable, but that many Nice Guys™ are insecure men unwilling to articulate their romantic or sexual feelings directly. Instead they choose present themselves as their paramour's friend, and hang around doing nice things for her in hopes that she will pick up on their desire for her. If she fails to read their secret feelings, Nice Guys™ become embittered and blame her for taking advantage of them and their niceness. The essays are particularly critical of what HBI sees as hypocrisy and manipulation on the part of self-professed Nice Guys™.[25][26]  Haha if any HBI ppl are on reddit they seriously need to [](/getin) if they aren't already :D",™

When Steam was launched on Mac over a year ago, did we suddenly see Apple's overpriced shiny hardware become a bastion for gamers? **Nope.** The same sorta happened with the Cider framework. Yes, a few EA games supported it but the Mac hardly became a gaming platform.  Don't get me wrong, I appreciate that Valve are supporting Linux but I seriously doubt they are going to single handedly usher in the Year of the Linux Desktop™  Also, I can see Steam for Linux simply not being worth it simply because the library of Linux supporting games is very shit just like it is for the Mac store. Sure you may see a few indie titles here and there but would you really want your platform clogged up by inferior FOSS games like Tux Racer, FreeCiv, OpenCity, The Battle of Wesnoth, and Frets on Fire? Most of which usually are free open source clones of already successful games. I mean *nobody* would greenlight even 40% of the shit games in that list.  Unless Valve tries to go the route of and outdoes Cedega, PlayOnLinux, and Wine; they would have accomplished nothing. This approach would rather rely on Windows 8 being a clear-cut failure so bad that it causes a mass-exodus from Microsoft's OS. And that won't happen, after all Windows ME never did it.  One other way that Valve could make Linux big is if they did the impossible and made it really easy for developers to port to Linux somehow, because at the end of the day it's as Steve Ballmer once said.

t5_2qh2p,throwaway0013,1352160011,"&gt;Kolob? God Living there? Not doctrine.  That's odd, because part of the Book of Mormon, right in the Book of Abraham 3:2-3, it says:   *""saw the stars, that they were very great, and that one of them was nearest unto the throne of God;....and the name of the great one is Kolob, because it is near unto me, for I am the Lord thy God: I have set this one to govern all those which belong to the same order as that upon which thou standest.""*  Then, in the Book of Mormon, Facsimile 2, Explanations to Fig. 1.:  *""Kolob, signifying the first creation, nearest to the celestial, or the residence of God. First in government, the last pertaining to the measurement of time. The measurement according to celestial time, which celestial time signifies one day to a cubit. One day in Kolob is equal to a thousand years according to the measurement of this earth, which is called by the Egyptians Jah-oh-eh.""*  The Book of Abraham describes a hierarchy of heavenly bodies, including the earth, its moon, and the sun, each with different movements and measurements of time, where at the pinnacle, the slowest-rotating body is Kolob, where one Kolob-day corresponds to 1000 earth-years.  (Abraham 3:4):  *""And the Lord said unto me, by the Urim and Thummim, that Kolob was after the manner of the Lord, according to its times and seasons in the revolutions thereof; that one revolution was a day unto the Lord, after his manner of reckoning, it being one thousand years according to the time appointed unto that whereon thou standest. This is the reckoning of the Lord's time, according to the reckoning of Kolob.""*  &gt;There is a lot of racist history found in religion broadly, and in most cultures. I hate it, everyone thinks its lame.  Not like in the Mormon church, but nice attempt at deflection.   &gt;Garments protecting Mormons? It's really more of a spiritual protection than a physical one. They remind Mormons of promises they have made to live chaste, serve God, etc.  True.  The only correction necessary.  &gt;but the Mormon bashing is a free for all  Ah, the old Mormon persecution complex™.  Your exaggerations do little to draw attention from the facts.

t5_2qh1e,SomePostMan,1352196624,"Well, I'm late to the party here...  I wrote out a long explanation of how I think the trick is done last time I saw this posted in a dead \/r/frisson thread^[1](http://www.reddit.com/r/Frisson/comments/velha/pennteller_fool_us_926_this_magician_will_blow/c545da5?context=3), in case anyone is interested:  &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; *Edit: timestamps below were based on [[this version]](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAjLQAc_2-Q).*  `- - - - -`  My best (shitty) guess:  In replacement tricks like this, the special card is often pre-chosen.  1. The 7♦ was pre-chosen, just like he joked (""it's okay if I see the card... I've seen this trick before""). He palmed the 7♦ in on top of Deck #1 [2:38 ... his hands appear empty at least for a moment but the angle and cut is limiting], the one he opened and that Penn shuffled. (Note that he didn't ask Penn to pick a random card, but the one ""on the back"".)  2. He swapped decks when he took the pen out [2:49] (as Penn noticed). The ""cooler"" deck that he brought in was:   · a shuffled deck with the joker, premiums, and 7♦ taken out, facing up;   · with the bottom half of the deck (8♦ and up) slightly pushed out (~1/16"") to make that slot easy to access;   · snugly in the box, with the bottom open, in the wrapper, with the bottom of the wrapper open;   · with a bit of easy adhesive (e.g. post-it-note glue, which won't smear or dry but will stay put for a second);   · with one custom-made extra-large card (~1/8"" wider, ~3/8"" longer) on top of it all to conceal the fact that the deck's in a box, sealed, and the bottom's hanging out.   (Note the angle of the deck toward the camera to maximize this effect.)  3. He finds the split in the deck and slides the signed 7♦ *face-down* into the deck at that spot (you can see him sliding it in carefully), then closes the bottom of the box and the wrapper behind it [3:00] while misdirecting with the Penn-pen joke and the sway of his body and laughing. Note his right thumb &amp; co. lingering near the bottom of the deck for a few seconds longer (camera angle limiting again).  4. He places the whole thing (sealed box with custom card on top) into Penn's hand, with his hand on top of the custom card, and has Penn cover it before removing the custom card.   &amp;nbsp;   (Sidenote:   ""Would it be impressive if I pulled out your card?"" This is to incorporate this seemingly-superfluous card into the act, so it doesn't seem so suspicious.   ""That would be very impressive."" Penn's just playing along and being nice. That trick alone would require only a slight palming of the card, and no deck switch.)   &amp;nbsp;   He claims the custom card he removed was the joker (and he probably made it a joker on the face side to be safe, although the camera contrast is too high to see) (of course, the cooler deck-box-wrapper never had a joker to begin with).  • Voila: Penn's holding a resealed deck containing 52 factory-ordered cards with his in the correct spot, but turned around. Shawn has him inspect the outside but not open it: there are no slits. He tears off the seal from the top. (It appears that he left the bottom of the seal on the deck, but again there's a camera cut. That might have been important or not depending on how he messed with the bottom.) The rest is automatic and he's very careful to turn the 7♦ around by the tips of his fingers so no one can suspect he simply palmed it in at the last moment.",♦

t5_2qil9,ccp_manifest,1352213612,"by CCP Ytterbium  The tiericide locomotive is well on track so far. Retribution ship changes are already packed and ready to be delivered to your personal fireplace on December, the 4th.  With the bulk of our work out of the way though, this begs the question, what are we going to do now with all that precious free time? Eat marshmallows on the CCP office balcony? Impossible, it’s snowing outside. Break CCP Fozzie’s fingers with the Nerfbat™? Already done. Fondly trim CCP Unifex’s hairs while singing dirty French limericks? No can do, he is desperately and irrevocably bald.  Well, guess that leaves us no choice but to move forward with future balancing plan then. Let’s assume 2012 is not the end of the world, the universe and all things we hold dear, and let’s take a peek into what we want to start tweaking next year.  Battlecruiser operational  Yes comrades, battlecruisers are indeed next to get through the tiericide revolution. Let’s face it, they had it coming, as current tier 2 variations perform too well while tier1s are found wanting. With this in mind, the plan is to adjust total slot layout to 17 on all of them and split them into two categories depending on their expected role.  First, the attack version; they favor speed and damage over resilience, which fits the current tier 3 battlecruisers extremely well.  Oracle, Naga, Talos and Tornado: are mostly fine, except for the mobility which is a little too high, and signature radius, which could be increased a bit. Apart from this, little needs to change. Second, the combat flavor, which follows in the footsteps of the frigate and cruiser variants – made for front line duty, they have a good balance of firepower and resilience.  Prophecy: expected to be changed to a drone boat. This is a role revamp that will radically modify its slot and fitting layout. It will most likely have less bandwidth but more drone bay than the Myrmidon.  Ferox: we would like to reinforce the sniping nature of this ship, most likely by replacing the shield resistance bonus with a hybrid damage bonus. Nothing is set in stone yet, as we need to find ways to ensure it doesn’t compete with the Naga.  Brutix: this ship role conflicts a bit with the Talos, mainly because the latter is more mobile and packs more punch. We want to explore options on how to turn the Brutix into a more reliable close-range brawler, while the Talos keeps a kiting advantage.  Cyclone: ancillary shield boosters have significantly improved this ship performance; however, it won’t hurt to make sure it’s in a good shape before moving on.  Harbinger: assuming direct control. Problems on this ship are tied with the shield versus armor tanking issues, which need to be looked at.  Drake: once again, blame the modules, not the hull – while missiles are being looked into by CCP Fozzie, shield tanking is the root of the problem here.  Myrmidon: this vessel is mainly fine, but it couldn’t hurt giving it a bit more drone bandwidth and bay to make it more of an improvement when compared to the Vexor.  Hurricane: counting CCP Fozzie’s adjustment to its fitting, the cruiser boost should reduce its over-the-top versatility, especially if battlecruisers slot layout is altered to 17 as mentioned above.  That’s the big lines for battlecruisers. As usual, your voice will be heard through feedback threads posted on the proper forum sub-section when the time is right (https://forums.eveonline.com/default.aspx?g=topics&amp;f=270). It is also worth noting that we will adjust ship mineral requirements as we continue with the rebalancing.  You sunk my battleship  Next on the ship rebalancing queue, battleships suffer the least from the current “tier” system, and most of them are fairly well balanced. However, some still require a little face lift, since we are one year into the future and we have the technology.  As usual, we would like to keep up with the ship line classification we have been using for frigate, destroyer and cruisers so far. This is not designed to arbitrarily pigeon-hole vessels into narrow roles, but to provide a basic line of operation for anyone to understand and follow through. The ship role and purpose on the battlefield will still greatly be influenced by the choice of modules, rigs and ammunitions you make.  First, let’s have a look at the disruption line, which only has one ship so far:  Scorpion: fine at the moment, it dies fast in fleet of course, but that’s what the ECM role brings to the hull anyway. Then, we have attack battleships, where most of the changes will be:  Armageddon: this ship is performing well at the time being, and thus we have little reason to alter it.  Megathron: just like the Thorax on the cruiser level, the Megathron role will be changed slightly to make it less resilient, but more mobile so to make proper use of blasters. Think of it as a ship closer to the Typhoon in terms of speed and agility. Next to a Talos, it will be more durable, more flexible, but still cumbersome to have in small gangs.  Typhoon: this vessel is very good when you possess all skills on earth and beyond trained to 5 – for being a jack of all trades, it has nothing really going for it. That is why we would like to change its role to a missile platform. Next to the Raven, it would have less range, but more mobility for more close range in your face damage.  And finally, combat vessels. They share the same functions as explained for battlecruisers above, so without further delay:  Apocalypse: is behaving well at the moment, so there is little point in changing it.  Raven: the king of the hill lost its throne a while back. That’s mainly due to cruise missiles being terrible in most situations, and torpedoes not always being usable with a slow, cumbersome hull.   Dominix: still remains a popular ship. It is fairly good, except for the drone mechanics themselves, which are terribly outdated. While we are not certain when this can be tackled, it definitely has high priority on our to-do list.  Tempest: we are mostly fine with it at the moment, no major change planned.  Abbadon: a nice ship with fine purpose in fleets and large gangs. Rokh: is also all good, very competitive with the Abbadon  Hyperion: the hull could be improved, but again most of the issues come from passive versus active tanking problems  Maelstorm: has a good role as well, no need for major changes  Again, mineral requirements are most likely to be tweaked as we go through the balancing process. Below you can see how all tech1 ships come together with the new tiericide overhaul.  IMAGE: http://cdn1.eveonline.com/www/newssystem/media/63522/1/2013shipbalancing.jpg  I love it when a plan comes together  As announced at the beginning of the year(http://community.eveonline.com/devblog.asp?a=blog&amp;nbid=9129), skill requirements will be modified when we are done overhauling tech1 battlecruisers and battleships. This consists of:  --Breaking Destroyers and Battlecruisers skills into four racial versions with an identical training multiplier (thus making it four times harder to get all races trained) --Changing skill requirements for Racial Cruisers from Racial Frigates 4 to Racial Destroyers 4 --Changing skill requirements for Racial Battleships from Racial Cruisers 4 to Racial Battlecruisers 4 --Changing skill requirements for capital ships from Racial Battleships 5 to 4, but introducing or increasing other skills to keep the same overall training time requirements  ",™

I watched that so many times; I'm not sure how I missed the fact that he fanned out the cards to offer a whole range instead of just the top card... it's very hard to see from the angle, but it's there.  My next best guess is that he palmed in a stack of about fifteen 7♦ so the whole range of the fan was forced.  The card pretty much had to have been pre-chosen, so figuring out what he did in the beginning to force it was the hardest part, with the camera angles and cuts and everything. (It's also comforting to note that, if the card was actually random, he likely would have just asked Penn to pick the card himself out of the shuffled deck without taking it back, as that would have made the trick much more impressive in that situation.)",♦

t5_2qxih,crafter,1352240750,"&gt; **Star Wars: The Old Republic – State of the Game**  &gt; Hello everyone,  &gt; This is the first of many regular “State-of-the-Game” postings to you, the players. It’s something I’ve wanted to do for a long time, and finally have the opportunity to get it started. I’m hoping to use these postings as a direct way to address some of the top unresolved issues that most concern our community. I won’t get to everything all at once, but I’ll try to hit some of the big ones, and talk about these topics as openly as I can. It’s my hope that you’ll respond with more comments, questions and concerns. As you do, I will then take these and either roll them into my next update, or have the Star Wars™: The Old Republic™ community team answer them directly as we usually do. Sound good? OK!  &gt; Before we begin, let me introduce myself for those of you who do not know me. My name is Jeff Hickman and I am the Executive Producer for Star Wars: The Old Republic. I have been working on the team for about 2 years now and was responsible for most of the Live Services and ultimately the launching of our award-winning game. Twelve years ago, I joined the industry as the Director of CS for Dark Age of Camelot (DAoC) with Mythic Entertainment. In the years since then, I have engaged in just about every role you can imagine on an MMO team (except art, because I suck at art). In the early days at Mythic, I helped design several expansions for DAoC, produced and ran their daily operations and in 2005 was given the opportunity to become Executive Producer for that beloved game. Between then and now, I built, launched and operated Warhammer Online and I was also Executive Producer for Ultima Online. I’ve devoted my life to MMOs and the people that play them, and have some cool tattoos to prove it:  &gt; When we decided to go Free-to-Play earlier this year, we had weeks of discussion with everyone on the team about where we thought the game was going, what we thought was going right and what was going wrong. We uncovered a lot of issues, but three things really stood out:  &gt; 1. Our game is awesome. People love it and want to play it.  &gt; 2. The subscription requirement was driving away huge numbers of people who do not want to commit to paying monthly.  &gt; 3. The frequency of our Game Updates was way too slow. People were leaving because we were not releasing new content fast enough to keep up with the pace at which it was being consumed.  &gt; You are now seeing the results of these conversations. Free-to-Play goes live this Fall, and we are dedicated to getting Game Updates out to you every 6 weeks or so. Though each of these efforts is incredibly challenging for the team, they have accepted that challenge and have tackled them head on!  &gt; But we know there is more we can do, more you want us to do. So today, I thought it might be more useful to dive into some more granular and “hot” topics.  &gt; **Topic #1: Staff: Why are some developers leaving The Old Republic™? How will the game be affected?**  &gt; Answer: People leave for a lot of reasons. Some have worked on the project for 6+ years and are simply tired and want to go work on something else. Others may not agree with the direction that the game is heading – Free-to-Play is not for everyone and requires a big shift in thinking and culture within the studio. Still others do not have the right skills for the roles that we have as the studio evolves and changes. When any single person leaves, whether we make the decision or they do, it is difficult, but the studio and game live on and thrive as we change, actually thrive because we change. The core of what makes the game and studio great are still here; quality in our game and in our workplace, people that are passionate about both, a camaraderie with each other that helps us support one another, and key people like James Ohlen (who was at BioWare from the very start) who continue to help us carry the banner of BioWare and who are dedicated to help evolve and improve Star Wars: The Old Republic.  &gt; **Topic #2: Bugs: How does testing work? Why do bugs get through? Why did Game Update 1.4 have so many of them? What are we doing to improve the process?**  &gt; Answer: MMOs are undoubtedly one of the most complex games on Earth. We employ hundreds of QA professionals to ensure that our game is high quality, but sometimes bugs get through. We test every step of the way as we develop the game or change to the game. We have many, many development environments that work in a sequence to push updates from initial construction, to code and content integration, to internal end-to-end testing, to player facing testing on Public Test Servers and then on to the Live servers. Sometimes (like in Game Update 1.4) we make changes that have unintended (and undiscovered) consequences on completely different parts of the game (the performance issues that showed up in the update are a great example of this). These unintended changes happen more often than you would think (or we would like), though we usually catch them before they go live. We have recently put new measures in place both on the development teams and in QA, as well on Public Test Server (where we should find many of these types of issues), to catch things like this in the future. I am not saying it will not happen again – bugs will always happen – but we will strive to give you the best, high quality, bug-free experience that we can. As a side note, we finally got a lock on the last of the major issues from Game Update 1.4 and appreciate your patience with that one.  &gt; **Topic #3: Oceanic populations. Are we doing anything about them?**  &gt; Answer: We are very aware of the concerns with the population levels on the Oceanic servers. The problem is pretty complex, as the solutions we have either split the populations further (like allowing Oceanic players to move to North American servers), or would force players to go to server types (PvP or RP, etc…) that they do not want to be on. Our current plan is to wait for Free-to-Play to launch and see what the influx of new players does to the populations of these servers. We will give it a little time and if we do not see significant improvement, then we will move ahead with the solution that offers the best playing experience for the Oceanic community.  &gt; OK, that is it for now. Please keep your comments and questions coming and I will try to answer the biggest, unresolved questions in these “State-of-the-Game” posts. I want to thank you all for the opportunity to be involved with such an amazing game like Star Wars: The Old Republic. I will do everything in my power to take care of the game, and help guide it to a great future.  &gt; Jeff Hickman &gt; Executive Producer",™

t5_2qh21,nathanielb,1352260703,"Hey aradabaugh, I'll see if I can help you a bit with this.  You say you're new to Ruby, so, my immediate response that I did a 37 minute presentation at this year's RailsConf regarding some of what you're mentioning (http://confreaks.com/videos/900-railsconf2012-how-to-find-valuable-gems). Primarily, that presentation talks about finding and evaluating gems... hopefully it's useful to you.  If nothing else, go see The Ruby Toolbox (https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/) and crowdsource your knowledge.  So, I do recognize your point and issue with naming.  That's one of my biggest concerns with Gems - and one that's not simple to fix.  Gems are required to have globally unique names to be useful (you can kind of get around that with custom gem hosts, but that's beyond your questions).  That means that someone came up with a library that did a task (say authentication) and named it something.  Then dev #2 came along and tried to make it better for vary it, and since Naming Is Hard™, often dev #2 will simply name their new library with a varient of the original gem's name.  And in most cases, the first name wasn't great anyway.  The problem simply compounds.  So, RubyGems (""gems"") are simply easily distributable Ruby libraries. They provide some extra meta data about the library (version information, other gem dependencies, summary, author info, etc.) Often a gem's scope is very focused, the functionality is very small, and the concerns - if written well - are very isolated.  A gem, by itself, is not your application.  It is simply a bit of code to do some certain task, hopefully well.  This idea is spread pretty much across all other languages with Perl having CPAN, Node has NPM, Python has PIP, etc.  Ruby certainly wasn't the first, and absolutely will not be the last implementation of this idea.  Now for your Bundler questions.  I mentioned that gems names are unique.  When you install gems, at its most basic level, you'd ""gem install bundler"" (to install Bundler).  But, typos are often an issue... so at some point, someone has name squatted typos of popular libraries.  You noticed that with ""bundle.""  If you look at the bundle gem's details (https://rubygems.org/gems/bundle), it has a runtime dependency on ""Bundler"" and the author has left a kind note.  If you trust him, then it is just a friendly way to install bundler for you when you have a typo.  If you don't trust him, maybe he's installing malware on your machine when you typo. ;)  Honestly, I've never seen that happen.  But it's possible and will likely happen some day.  Some gems install executables, like Bundler which installs ""bundle.""  Some gems are simply Ruby code that gets required into your application.  If you use Bundler and define a gem dependency in the Gemfile, then Bundler will often require the library for you.  This is the case when using Rails, which has a dependency and uses Bundler and Gemfiles.  It's pretty simple to see what a gem does.  Just go to Rubygems.org and search for it, or just make the URL yourself: https://rubygems.org/gems/GEMNAME.  You'll immediately get an idea of its dependencies, usually a link to the source which is often on Github anymore, often it'll have a link to the documentation, and author or description information.  I hope that helps.  Certainly let me know if you have more questions about it.",™
t5_2qh1i,kristianwithak,1352261520,"I was working at McDonalds in Pickering (near Toronto) Ontario, and i always had custom name tags. ""assman"" and ""poppin fresh"" were a couple of them. I finally figured out how to use the symbols on the label maker and the first symbol was the handicapped one. So i made a label that stated ""Retard"" with a handicapped symbol on either side of the  word. I was pretty high and there hasn't been any orders for about 35 minutes, so i asked my co-worker in the kitchen with me if he dared me to put it in the next order that came. He said no, but i felt like in many ways, i already dared myself. Next order on the screen was a 10pc Chicken McNuggets. I slapped the sticker on the inside of the box over the ""Nugget"" part so on the inside it said ""10 piece Chicken Mc♿Retard♿"" About an hour later, a lady came in, and she was crying. I asked the cashier what the hell was goin on and he said ""i undo, this bitch is crying and holding a nugget box"" i thought to myself, ""who the fuck waits an hour to eat there nuggets?""  I talked to my manager later and it turned out her son had Downs Syndrome. I asked my manager if i was going to be fired and he said we'll have to talk to head office. They called head office and it turns out the person who was at the top of the chain at McDonalds Head office also funded a school for mentally challenged children. soooooo i was terminated. ",♿

t5_mouw,PolywellFan,1352272197,"The Polywell has been mentioned several times on Reddit.  It is a new idea for a fusion reactor.  Here is how it works:  1.	Electrons emitted.  They experience an electric force pulling them towards the rings. 2.	Electrons caught (the magnetic Lorentz force is stronger than the electric Lorentz force).  3.	Electrons captured in center.  The electrons are boxed in by 6 magnetic mirrors.  4.	A large (~1E12) electron cloud is captured in center.  5.	Uncharged deuterium gas blown towards rings.  6.	Deuterium hits edge of electron cloud.  Gas heats up past 16 eV and ionizes. 7.	The Ion falls towards the electron cloud.  Ion heats up past 10 KeV.   8.	If two deuterium ions hit at more than 10 keV, they can fuse. 9.	The fusion product is too energetic to be held in the cloud.  More details at: http://thepolywellblog.blogspot.com/2012/09/how-it-works.html  Critics argue: 1.	Electron and ion cloud temperature must be within 5% of itself (this is bad).  2.	X-rays are generated which strip away all machine energy.  (But recycling this loss may be possible)   3.	The ions have a bell curve of energy, where most of the ions are too cold (but this has not been shown experimentally).   There are many unanswered questions.  But what is clear the machine can fuse material.  It may be the newest, cheapest and smallest machine in the world to do so.

For example with a Combat Level 158 character with 80 Strength and 76 attack wielding full Bandos with a BGS, I could only land about 2% of my hits on a TzHaar-Ket (the level 127 melee mobs in the TzHaar City.) This game is **STILL** LuckScape.™ This time you just get to mash a few bittons to give a chance for one of your lucky attacks to actually have an effect.  Yes, this was Melee vs Melee on a mob about 30 combat levels below me with the best gear money could buy and I could hardly hit it.  If Jagex want to make this game skillful, they need to just nuke the combat triangle from orbit, give everybody a 100% chance to hit, scale down damage a little to accomodate for this and actually make the game require a good amount of skill instead of ""countering.""  Rock-Paper-Scissors works for RTS games. Not MMORPGs. I honestly feel like Jagex have merely tried to just slap an action bar and a few unique abilities on an already existing and already fucking awful combat system, and just made it worse.  This is not the overhaul I was hoping for. I was hoping for combat to be more engaging, more skillful. I was hoping that I'd be able to land nearly all of my attacks and that gear and stats would no longer govern your chance to hit. I was dead wrong. In fact, you have to be even luckier than before to land a hit because of how much they fucked over combatants who aren't fighting in a style according to their foe's weakness.  As for luck, it doesn't belong in Runescape at all. Do you think World of Warcraft would have been the dominant MMORPG if your hit chance was 2% instead of 95% baseline and weren't actually raiseable by stats? **FUCKING NO.**",™

t5_2qxih,crafter,1352325806,"&gt; **Developer Update: Free-to-Play Option**  &gt; Greetings and Salutations!  &gt; Our scheduled launch for the Free-to-Play option for Star Wars™: the Old Republic™ is approaching quickly. The team developing this option has been working hard to hit this date, and as I write this, we have an alpha version of the complete experience up and running, and have been running extensive play tests of the experience. Early feedback has been extremely positive; from both die-hard Star Wars: The Old Republic fans as well as players who have never played the game before. We are now deep into a polish phase, working on bringing the complete experience up to the high quality level that our customers expect from a BioWare game.  &gt; As the Lead Designer of the team that has been working on the new Free-to-Play option, our goal is to bring to you the best possible experience. We started this process several months ago, and since then we have been led by two core philosophies that are crucial to how we view and think about such a large design shift.  &gt; The first core rule is that we want to be sure that players can reach level 50 without paying a cent, if so desired. The final design meets this requirement: Free-to-Play players can play levels 1 through 50 and enjoy the vast majority of the classic storyline and side quests during their journey. A member of our Marketing team once observed that Star Wars: The Old Republic is roughly 24 times the size of the original Star Wars™: Knights of the Old Republic™ game. Well, now BioWare is letting players have all that story content for free! That’s not to say there won’t be restrictions – Free-to-Play players will earn experience more slowly, for example, and several aspects of the gameplay experience are limited. If you have friends who love Star Wars™ and the BioWare-style storytelling, but were uneasy about the monthly subscription, or paying $60 up front for the box – well, come mid-November, those concerns should be erased.  &gt; The second core rule is that subscribers should not experience any degradation of their gameplay experience. Those of you who are still paying a monthly fee should still get the same gameplay experience and you won’t find anything taken away from you and the gameplay that you currently enjoy. Furthermore, we really wanted to be sure that in no way would subscribers feel they needed to make purchases from the Cartel Market in order to be competitive in the game.  &gt; We not only met these goals, in my opinion, but exceeded expectations – subscribers will enjoy new benefits from the update, including two more quick slot bars, a new purchasable Cargo Hold tab, and a monthly grant of Complimentary Cartel Coins to spend however they like in the Cartel Market. Subscribers can also buy the same experience boosts available in the Cartel Market as Free-to-Play players, which allow characters to advance at a rapid pace.  &gt; We highly value all of our players and it is important for us to ensure that our players recognize the value offered in both the subscription and Free-to-Play option.  &gt; **Rewards Program**  &gt; We also felt it was very important to thank our subscribers for being members of The Old Republic community. To reward all of you, we will grant Complimentary Cartel Coins to every player who has been a subscriber prior to the launch of the Free-To-Play option. The actual size of the grant will depend on how many months you were a paying subscriber prior to our announcement and after our announcement. There will also be special grants to those who purchased the Star Wars: The Old Republic Collector’s Edition and Digital Deluxe Edition. Want to know how many Complimentary Cartel Coins you have earned? Click here to find out! We are literally granting millions of dollars worth of Complimentary Cartel Coins as part of this program. But you’ll only receive a grant of Complimentary Cartel Coins if you’re an active subscriber when the Free-to-Play option goes live!  &gt; Look for more ideas of what Cartel Coins can purchase in coming weeks! Here’s a hint: fans of vehicles and pets will not be disappointed. Also, there will be a wealth of equipment that will be fully moddable, adaptive in weight and have no class restrictions, giving players wildly new directions in which to customize their appearance.  &gt; **Preferred Status**  &gt; And we have not forgotten about those of you who once had accounts, but cancelled. We are hoping to get you to come back and play! Any player who has ever paid a monthly subscription fee will be given Preferred Status automatically when Free-to-Play option is launched. Players with Preferred Status do not face the same limitations as a Free-to-Play player and will find that some restrictions are either removed or greatly reduced.  &gt; In addition, Preferred Status can be earned by any Free-to-Play player who spends a minimum of $4.99 at our web store.  &gt; **A Brave New World**  &gt; The team has been hard at work developing the Free-to-Play option. We feel like the Free-to-Play option will be a huge boost for both the game and the community by giving more fans access to the game. Star Wars: The Old Republic is a fantastic game and a top-tier MMO. We are looking forward to welcoming all of the new fans! We appreciate your support!  &gt; May the Force Be With You  &gt; Damion Schubert &gt; Star Wars: The Old Republic Lead Designer",™

t5_2qgzt,Itkovan,1352352965,"What point are you trying to make by repeatedly stating this is the signature performance model?  (A fact I have know since far before this post, as every review I've ever seen has been of the signature performance model.  Often Elon Musk loans out his personal vehicle for reviewers, but not this one as his is black.)   Further, you don't seem to understand Tesla is a startup car company.  Ramping up production takes time.  They've sold out - from memory - two plus years worth of production.  Even taking into account the improvements they are constantly making.  They have doubled production volume repeatedly but it's still not enough.   Why would there be that kind of demand?  Why would there be that kind of demand from a market which tries to leave no model variant stone unturned?  I mean fuck, we've got crossovers that look like everything from station wagons to mini SUVs, SUVs of all sizes, even bastardized cars like the 5 series GT and the original form of that, the CLS.  Which then spawned stuff like the CC.  We've had a market where companies were trying to make stuff like the Subaru Baja and Pontiac Aztek.  Fuck me, if the existing entities thought they could sell a fucking goat strapped to a pig with a hybrid logo we would be seeing ads for the amazing GoatPig XLE Hybrid™.   It took these silicon valley guys to completely overhaul how we saw EVs.  The previous wisdom was you couldn't sell something with a limited range or lackluster performance, so Tesla first released the Roadster which addressed both of those.  But of course cost quite a bit.  Then the ""wisdom"" changed to that well, yeah, you can make a small light roadster, but it's impossible to pull off in a production sedan.  So now they've released one, and it fucking rocks.  The awards are starting to roll in - we'll see many more - because this is a game changing vehicle.    It is the ipod of the vehicle world.  You are the CmdrTaco.  Infamous quote ""No wireless. Less space than a nomad. Lame.""  No one gives a shit about aluminum.  This thing is sleek, it's fast, it's well put together (COUGH Fiskar Karma COUGH,) it's fun to drive, and it's practical.  The only con is that it is expensive, but it's still a landmark vehicle **precisely because it IS a step towards EV vehicles for the masses**.  There is a mountain of technology that could not have gotten started without being in $100k vehicles.   But! Aluminum!!  Shut up.  This is a step towards EVs, yes it is the signature model, yes you can buy them for less, YES other mfrs had the capability to make this before they did, BUT. THEY. DIDN'T.  Just like no one came up with the iPod or iPhone before Apple did, at least not in the way that caught on with the masses.",™

t5_2qh2p,Dudesan,1352355617,"&gt;Of course, that's assuming we ran the world the way Jesus advocates it in the Gospels  What Gospels have *you* been reading?  Remember, many Christians find it more comfortable to believe in a god who doesn't condone, command or commit murder, slavery, rape, child abuse, animal abuse, arson, torture, ritual mutilation, fratricide, patricide, matricide, infanticide, genocide, and so on than to believe in one who does. Unfortunately, since the Bible (Old Testamant and New) is pretty clear about Yahweh's position on these things, holding a belief in Loving Hippie Jesus™ requires ignoring huge portions of it. Or just never reading it in the first place, which seems to be the most popular option.  Well, let's see what Jesus has to say about that:  &gt;“Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished.  (Matthew 5:17-18, NIV)  Some Christians claim that his death and resurrection ""fulfill"" this. That is bullshit for one simple reason: last time I checked, Heaven and Earth haven't passed away.  Jesus also made his views on people ""picking and choosing"" quite clear:  &gt;[Jesus] answered them, “And why do you break God’s commandment because of your tradition? For God said:    *Honor your father and your mother;* and, *The one who speaks evil of father or mother must be put to death.*  &gt; But you say, ‘Whoever tells his father or mother, “Whatever benefit you might have received from me is a gift committed to the temple”—  he does not have to honor his father.’ In this way, you have revoked God’s word because of your tradition. Hypocrites! Isaiah prophesied correctly about you when he said:    &gt;These people honor Me with their lips, but their heart is far from Me.  They worship Me in vain, teaching as doctrines the commands of men.”  (Matthew 15:3-9, NIV)   Looks like Jesus has quite a bit to say about people who ignore commandments, in fact. But maybe it's just Matthew?  &gt;It is easier for heaven and earth to disappear than for the least stroke of a pen to drop out of the Law.  (Luke 16:17, NIV)  Okay, so Jesus is a bust. Let's see what the Epistles have to say about the Mosaic Code:  &gt; If you really keep the royal law found in Scripture, “Love your neighbor as yourself,” you are doing right.  But if you show favoritism, you sin and are convicted by the law as lawbreakers. For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it.   (James 2:8-10, NIV)  &gt;All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness,  (2 Timothy 3:16)  &gt;Do we, then, nullify the law by this faith? Not at all! Rather, we uphold the law.  (Romans 3:31)  &gt;Know this first of all, that *there is no prophecy of scripture that is a matter of personal interpretation*, for no prophecy ever came through human will; but rather human beings moved by the holy Spirit spoke under the influence of God.""  (2 Peter 1:20-21 NAB)  ----  Well, shit.   This problem disappears quite quickly if you assert that most of the Bible is hogwash, and you only care about the good parts. If you prefer to cling to it as an inspired document, vague mutterings about ""context"" or about Jesus abolishing the old Law won't get you anywhere. ",™

t5_2rbu1,ITSigno,1352380644,"Give me a break. You know the problem as well as I do. There is a well-earned perception that police officers that screw up/go too far/commit crimes do *not* face the same punishment as a non-LEO in the same situation. In the cases where the department takes action, the union fights it and gets the job back for the misbehaving officer. And the DA will almost never press charges against an officer.  &gt;The reddit hivemind  Call it what it is: The majority opinion. We aren't borg wired into some common thought structure.   As to videos of good interactions getting downvoted to oblivion.. are we on the same reddit? I can recall several such videos being successful. Hell, I recall one a couple of months ago that was from a news segment in a local tv station that was nothing but gushing praise for an officer with lots of interviews from local residents. He couldn't have paid them to be so kind.  That said, there are far more videos with poor behaviour. There is, however, a very simple reason why: people don't post the boring videos on youtube. The video of the drunk lady in cuffs sitting on the curb who kicks the officer is a frequent repost. And the comments are filled with people supporting and people condemning the officer. Reddit isn't a hivemind, but controversy breeds discussion. The videos with good behaviour are unremarkable because that's how it is supposed™ to be.  Now, I do think there are far bigger issues than individual officers. There are serious systematic problems (e.g Police Officers' bill of rights, asset forfeiture, collusion between Police and DA's office/local justices, etc.)  I love it when I see police departments getting involved in community outreach, helping prevent problems before they become an issue, and so on. But that doesn't mean I, or anyone else, has to like the abuses.

t5_2qhlc,LawyerCT,1352392640,"Good question and one we naturally get asked a lot. In terms of performance--and thatonedude1 &amp; you bring up below--DNT+ creates fewer page errors than Ghostery. We do a lot of testing and receive a ton of bug reports from our users about page errors, like this video isn't loading on ESPN or this comment box isn't working, and we make individual tweaks to prevent that from happening. However, I believe Ghostery currently has a slightly longer list of trackers they block than DNT+, although we're always working to expand that when we find new ones. DNT+ blocks tracking by default, whereas you have to manually turn that on in Ghostery.  Other than error rates, there's not a huge difference in what the products do. In terms of business model/philosophy, however, there's a pretty big difference. Ghostery is owned by Evidon, formerly called Better Advertising Inc. They make money when Ghostery users opt into GhostRank, which collects and sells to advertisers aggregate information about the sites you visit, the ads you see, the links you click, etc., in order to build ""better"" advertising. They clearly state this [on their website:](http://www.evidon.com/solutions/encompass) &gt; Evidon Encompass leverages a proprietary library of more than 1,100 tracking scripts, as well as the seven million-member, opt-in Ghostery® panel, which anonymously supplies tracking code data on over 26 million websites.   Contrast their business model with ours: we have a freemium model and use zero tracking. We don't collect personal information through DNT+, period. We make money when our customers choose to buy one of our premium products, like [DeleteMe](http://www.abine.com/deletemedetail.php). We don't have any trackers on our site or in DNT+, and we don't sell (or have) user data through our add-ons. In sum, Ghostery is monetized through Evidon, an advertising compliance company. DNT+ is monetized through consumers who decide to pay us.",®

t5_2qndt,pojut,1352393171,"As someone that straddles the line, let me tell you that asking this question is only going to cause you extreme frustration.  You see, what the Republican party is supposed to stand for, what it used to stand for, and even what it **says** it stands for, doesn't match up with what they actually *do*.  Republican (and, to an extent, Conservative) values include reducing the size of the federal government as much as reasonably possible, reducing the intrusion of federal laws into the daily lives of the common citizen, leveling the playing field so that the only thing holding back your success is *you* (and a bit of luck, of course), and just generally letting people live their lives. Those common slogans you hear about freedom, liberty, etc? They're not just empty platitudes; they're accurate and correct representations of what Republican beliefs actually are.  Sounds good, right? Well, here's where the frustration comes in. The actual Republican **Party** does almost none of those things. They advocate ""shrinking"" the size of government while exploding the size of our military. They advocate ""keeping government out of our lives"" while condoning the war on (some) drugs, regulating marriage, pushing for prayer in public schools, etc. They advocate people having the freedom to make it on their own, while heavily stacking the deck against the common man in the form of massive corporations lining the pockets of Congress (all while claiming that it's ""just the way the free market goes"".) Worst of all, they advocate freedom of religion, so long as your religion involves praying to a half-naked guy nailed to two slats of wood.  Now, don't get me wrong: there are a LOT of Republicans out there that still hold True Republican® values, and the vast majority of them are honest, hard-working people. Unfortunately, these authentic Republicans aren't the ones running the party, and are often labeled as ""RINOs"" (Republicans in Name Only.)   In short, the Republican party has been hijacked by the very whackjobs that they accuse of ruining this country.",®
t5_2sff7,agentlame,1352394634,"&gt;How did this crap start and what made you think it was a niche that needed to be filled on reddit?  I think it started when SRD passed about 10k subscribers.

t5_2qh1i,UnreasonablyHostile,1352395970,"Hey, I've got a crazy idea! Instead of doing some bigoted fingerpointing, let's Ask Social Science™ what terrorism really is (and isn't).  First, we need to define ""terrorism."" According to the law of the United States (18 USC § 2331):  &gt; (1) the term “international terrorism” means activities that—  &gt; (A) involve violent acts or acts dangerous to human life that are a violation of the criminal laws of the United States or of any State, or that would be a criminal violation if committed within the jurisdiction of the United States or of any State;  &gt; (B) appear to be intended— (i) to intimidate or coerce a civilian population; (ii) to influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion; or (iii) to affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination, or kidnapping; and  &gt;(C) occur primarily outside the territorial jurisdiction of the United States, or transcend national boundaries in terms of the means by which they are accomplished, the persons they appear intended to intimidate or coerce, or the locale in which their perpetrators operate or seek asylum  More simply, ""terrorism"" is defined as an act which breaks the law of the United States **and** is designed to influence its policy (foreign or domestic). Despite ""terror"" being in the word, the emotion of fear is not, itself, a defining characteristic of terrorism.  So, why might a person or group of people resort to terrorist acts to influence the policy of the United States? I know what you're thinking: ""religion,"" ""fundamentalism,"" ""ignorance,"" ""they hate are freedums."" Well... you're completely and utterly wrong. But good job. Terrorism, first and foremost, is *rational*. How? ""Rational actors"" are best defined in light of the ""thin"" model of rational choice: that rational actors are those who “select from among available alternatives the option that best serves their self-interests"" (Yee, 1997). The important difference between rational and irrational actions is that *rational* actions are believed by the actors themselves to be instrumental in attaining the goals they hold in light of their beliefs (see also Taylor, 1988).   Terrorism, as a tactic, is not very resource heavy or easy to prevent/end. Terrorist groups can cause significant damage with very few members and very little funding- just look at 9/11. If you lack significant resources (a common characteristic of non-state actors), but you hold goals which are significantly at odds with the system in which you theoretically operate, then terrorism can appear to be a legitimately rational tactic.   Terrorists **are not in any sense** motivated by religion, fundamentalism, ideology, etc. into undertaking terrorist actions- their beliefs only inform their goals, not the route by which they seek to attain them. The only way to stop terrorism is to create a situation in which terrorist action is no longer the most readily available rational choice; in other words, a system in which all actors regardless of views are heard equally and fairly, with each holding a fair chance of having their viewpoint acted upon either at that time or in reoccurring contests at some point in the future.   We have a name for that system: ""democracy.""  Edit: oh, and just in case you wanted to blame Islam in particular, consider this: there are approximately a billion Muslims on the planet. There are also approximately a billion Catholics, and maybe 600 million Evangelicals. If Islam ""causes"" terrorism, then Catholicism causes pedophilia and Evangelism causes closeted gay hookups.  Or maybe religion has nothing at all to do with it, and you're just ignoring the large number of high profile non-Muslim terrorists, like the Red Army Fraktion, the Tamil Tigers, the ELF/ALF, the KKK...

Sound quality is the best I have heard but I'm no authority on sound. the Mic is amazing, this was one of the key factors of buying it, Very clear with noise cancelling that really works, Due to the cups insulating the ears it has a Mic monitor as well, so you can hear yourself speak. the morphing is Fun, and the volume roller and mute is in a good position. the battery life was around 11 hours to begin with - now a year later its around 10 hours (takes around 2hours to fully charge) radius is crazy good... The freedom is great. The disconnecting issue seems to be more related to which usb port you have it plugged into and/or what the other adjacent usb ports are doing, particularly Usb3 ports, their activity interferes with the same frequency logitech uses, this is a motherboard/hardware issue that's apparently well known, and not logitechs fault. however perhaps if logitech moved to different band the problem will disappear. experiment with your ports 'till you find a good one, I found the furthest usb2 port away from mobo did the trick.

t5_2qpol,Emperor_Mao,1352472340,"As someone that straddles the line, let me tell you that asking this question is only going to cause you extreme frustration. You see, what the Republican party is supposed to stand for, what it used to stand for, and even what it says it stands for, doesn't match up with what they actually do. Republican (and, to an extent, Conservative) values include reducing the size of the federal government as much as reasonably possible, reducing the intrusion of federal laws into the daily lives of the common citizen, leveling the playing field so that the only thing holding back your success is you (and a bit of luck, of course), and just generally letting people live their lives. Those common slogans you hear about freedom, liberty, etc? They're not just empty platitudes; they're accurate and correct representations of what Republican beliefs actually are. Sounds good, right? Well, here's where the frustration comes in. The actual Republican Party does almost none of those things. They advocate ""shrinking"" the size of government while exploding the size of our military. They advocate ""keeping government out of our lives"" while condoning the war on (some) drugs, regulating marriage, pushing for prayer in public schools, etc. They advocate people having the freedom to make it on their own, while heavily stacking the deck against the common man in the form of massive corporations lining the pockets of Congress (all while claiming that it's ""just the way the free market goes"".) Worst of all, they advocate freedom of religion, so long as your religion involves praying to a half-naked guy nailed to two slats of wood. Now, don't get me wrong: there are a LOT of Republicans out there that still hold True Republican® values, and the vast majority of them are honest, hard-working people. Unfortunately, these authentic Republicans aren't the ones running the party, and are often labeled as ""RINOs"" (Republicans in Name Only.) In short, the Republican party has been hijacked by the very whackjobs that they accuse of ruining this country.",®

t5_2cneq,pojut,1352479311,"As someone who only decided to vote on the day before the election (more on that in a second), I'll chime in here. Personally, I **refuse** to vote against someone. To me, a vote means that I **support** someone, not that I **don't** support someone else. You can argue all day long about the practicality of this approach vis a vis reality, but it won't change the fact that I'll only vote in favor of someone. Choosing between ""the lesser of two evils"" is a pointless exercise to me, and the only time a vote could be considered truly wasted.  Now, on to why I personally almost didn't vote this year. I was planning on voting for Buddy Roemer (I vehemently disagree with the guy socially, but almost 100% agree with him fiscally.) Once he dropped out of the race, completely conceded, and then endorsed Gary Johnson, I took it to mean he didn't want people writing him in. An assumption on my part to be sure, but there it is all the same. Because of this, I was content to sit out the election. While I'm *very* glad that Obama beat out Romney, I don't personally support Obama. As previously mentioned, this means I wouldn't actually vote for him, even though I wanted him to ""win"" when compared to Romney.  The only reason why I ended up voting (and, yes, I did write Roemer in, even though it didn't really matter in the grand scheme of things) was, as pointed out by my wife, the large number of important ballot initiatives in the state we live, Maryland. We had gay marriage (voted in favor of), an increase in the number of gambling permits to increase total tax revenue while lowering the tax burden on individual MD casinos (voted in favor of), an initiative granting police higher-ups the ability to make certain decisions without the approval of the police union (voted in favor of)...lots of important stuff. If I recall, we had a total of 10 or 11 ballot initiatives, all of them a fairly Big Deal®.  So, to sum it all up: I, and many others, refuse to vote against someone. Voting for someone, or voting on a lot of important ballot initiatives, are the only two ways to get me in a booth. Trying to convince me to vote **against** someone is the fastest way to make me want to sit on the sidelines. ",®

In this case we're talking about pen digitizers. Pressure based digitizers work differently than the Wacom digitizers, for example, and you see it when a Wacom pen can be detected without touching the screen. The capacitive sensors are using (IIRC) our natural body electrostatic to detect touch, and so the pen mimics that by doing the same.

Combattants islamistes près de Tombouctou, en avril. © AFP/Romaric Ollo Hien Alors qu'une intervention armée dans le nord du Mali se précise, les jihadistes affluent. Parmi eux, des jeunes venus des camps sahraouis. Enquête sur une dérive mafieuse et terroriste. Lentement, inexorablement, la perspective d'une guerre des sables pour la reconquête du Nord-Mali, désormais planifiée sans plus de précisions pour le premier quadrimestre de 2013, se rapproche. À Tombouctou, à Gao, à Bourem, à Tessalit et dans toutes les localités de l'Azawad quotidiennement survolées par des avions de surveillance, les jihadistes s'organisent dans la fièvre pour la mère de toutes leurs batailles. Un vent de paranoïa souffle sur les katibas d'Aqmi, du Mujao et d'Ansar Eddine, qui multiplient contrôles et arrestations au sein d'une population civile soupçonnée d'abriter la cinquième colonne de l'ennemi impie. Des caches d'armes, de carburant et de munitions sont creusées à la hâte autour de la demi-douzaine de camps d'entraînement récemment ouverts pour accueillir les nouvelles recrues venues de tous les recoins d'un « Sahelistan » qui s'étend de l'Atlantique au Darfour, attirées autant par les primes offertes - jusqu'à 3 000 euros par individu - que par les mirages de la guerre sainte. En petits détachements de 40 à 60 hommes, jusqu'à 300 volontaires selon les services de renseignements français sont ainsi arrivés courant octobre à Tombouctou et Gao, dont une bonne partie, pour ne pas dire l'essentiel selon les témoins, s'expriment en hassaniya, le dialecte arabe des Maures et des Sahraouis. Rendue publique par l'AFP le 21 octobre et développée depuis dans plusieurs reportages, l'information selon laquelle des membres du Front Polisario auraient rejoint le Nord-Mali a été aussitôt démentie par la direction du mouvement indépendantiste, le ministère français des Affaires étrangères précisant de son côté qu'il n'avait « pas eu connaissance » de liens entre le Polisario et les jihadistes. À juste titre. L'on imagine mal, effectivement, Mohamed Abdelaziz et les chefs du Front s'acoquiner avec des groupes terroristes en guerre ouverte contre leur hôte algérien. Sauf que ni lui ni les autorités d'Alger ne sont jusqu'ici parvenus à enrayer la progression du virus salafiste chez les jeunes des camps de réfugiés de la région de Tindouf, encore moins à empêcher le départ de ces desperados d'un exil sans fin vers les rivages chimériques du jihad rétribué. Totalement occultée par les indépendantistes sahraouis et les médias algériens, l'existence dans les camps d'activistes se réclamant de la Salafiya Jihadiya (ou, plus récemment, d'Ansar el-Charia) n'est pas un phénomène récent. Importé à la fin des années 1990 par des étudiants sahraouis rentrés des universités algériennes et de cette pépinière salafiste que fut l'Institut théologique saoudien de Nouakchott (fermé en 2003), l'islamisme radical trouve rapidement un écho favorable dans trois mosquées très fréquentées du désert : Omar Ibn Al-Khattab (camp dit de Smara), Abou Bakr Assedik (camp dit d'Aousserd) et Alkitab wa Assouna (camp de Laayoune). C'est là qu'ont lieu les premiers recrutements, sous la houlette d'imams autoproclamés tels que Mohamed Salem Lahbichi et Abba Ould Saleh, alias Abou Salman. La première participation connue de salafistes radicaux issus des rangs du Polisario à une tentative d'opération terroriste remonte à décembre 2003, lorsque la police mauritanienne arrête, à Nouadhibou, un ancien soldat de l'Armée populaire de libération sahraouie (APLS) pour vol d'explosifs. Il s'agit là d'un acte isolé, mais son auteur, Baba Ould Mohamed Bakhili, reconnaît très vite travailler pour le compte du Groupe salafiste pour la prédication et le combat, le GSPC, qui deviendra Al-Qaïda au Maghreb islamique (Aqmi) en janvier 2007. Acide nitrique Cette connexion se vérifie quatre mois plus tard lors du démantèlement, toujours en Mauritanie, d'une filière de recrutement jihadiste dont l'animateur, Mohamed Lamine Ould Louleïd, dit Maaouya, vient des camps de Tindouf. Elle se confirme de façon spectaculaire en juin 2005 quand deux katibas du GSPC, la katiba des Moulathamine de l'Algérien Mokhtar Belmokhtar, et la katiba Tarek Ibn Ziad, dont le noyau dur est composé de Sahraouis, prennent d'assaut le poste mauritanien de Lemgheity. Elle ne fera plus de doute au cours des années suivantes, à l'occasion de plusieurs accrochages violents survenus en Algérie (attaque de la brigade de gendarmerie d'El-Menia, en avril 2006), en Mauritanie (démantèlement d'une cellule d'Aqmi dont l'objectif était d'assassiner l'ambassadeur d'Israël, en octobre 2008) ou au Niger (combat de Telemses entre la katiba Tarek Ibn Ziad et l'armée nigérienne, en décembre 2009). À chaque fois, des Sahraouis ayant reçu une formation militaire dans les camps du Polisario sont impliqués.      Les émirs d'Aqmi recrutent au sein des camps du Polisario.  Pour Abdelmalek Droukdel, le chef suprême d'Aqmi, et les émirs successifs de la zone sud - Yahia Djouadi, Nabil Makhloufi et depuis peu Djamel Oukacha, alias Yahia Abou el-Hamman -, recruter au sein des camps du Polisario est à la fois un moyen de combler les pertes dans leurs propres rangs et l'assurance d'obtenir des moudjahidine aguerris, connaissant parfaitement le terrain saharien. Arrêté au Mali en novembre 2007 alors qu'il cherchait à se procurer une quantité importante d'acide nitrique, puis extradé en Mauritanie où il purge depuis une peine de dix années de prison, Hakim Ould Mbarek, fils d'un fonctionnaire du protocole du Polisario, illustre un autre aspect de cette collaboration : le trafic. Avec son complice Maaouya (cité plus haut), il détournait dans les camps de réfugiés des stocks de médicaments, de munitions et de pièces de rechange, puis les enfouissait dans des caches repérables par GPS, avant de les vendre aux jihadistes. Une dérive mafieuse qui va rapidement prendre de l'ampleur. Le 7 septembre 2009, quatre cadres du Polisario dont l'adjoint du commandant de la Ire région militaire Taleb Ami Deih sont kidnappés en territoire algérien par un gang d'Arabes Bérabiche du Nord-Mali et emmenés à Taoudenni avant d'être libérés quelques jours plus tard contre le paiement d'une rançon par la direction du mouvement indépendantiste. En cause : une cargaison de cannabis venue du Maroc et non livrée à ses destinataires maliens. Deux mois plus tard, trois humanitaires espagnols sont enlevés sur l'axe Nouakchott-Nouadhibou par un groupe se réclamant d'Aqmi et dirigé par Omar Ould Hamma (dit Omar Sahraoui), ex-membre du Polisario naturalisé malien et trafiquant notoire. Capturé à son tour par des agents mauritaniens à Gao, puis exfiltré vers Nouakchott, Omar Sahraoui sera finalement échangé en août 2010 contre les humanitaires qu'il avait ravis. En décembre 2010, un nouvel incident survient entre l'armée mauritanienne et une colonne de trabendistes sahraouis. Arrêtés, ces derniers citent le nom de leur commanditaire, Mohamed Ould el-Mhaidi, alias Rubio, baron régional de la drogue, ex-cadre de la IIe région militaire du Polisario et proche du patron des services de sécurité du Front, Mohamed Ould Laakik. Réalité sordide Dans la nuit du 22 au 23 octobre 2011 enfin, c'est le coup d'éclat, mais aussi le coup de grâce pour la crédibilité sécuritaire du Polisario. Deux humanitaires espagnols et une italienne sont kidnappés au camp de Rabbouni, à quelques dizaines de mètres des locaux abritant la présidence de la République arabe sahraouie démocratique (RASD) et amenés dans la localité malienne d'El-Khalil, non loin de la frontière algérienne (ils seront libérés neuf mois plus tard). Considéré comme l'acte fondateur du Mujao, la branche dissidente d'Aqmi qui règne aujourd'hui sur la ville de Gao, et revendiqué par son chef militaire, le Malien Ahmed Tilemsi, alias Abderahmane Ould el-Ameur, ce rapt a été commis par des Arabes Bérabiche guidés par une poignée de Sahraouis, dont les dénommés Aghdafna Hamadi Ould Ahmed Baba et Mamina Ould Laghfin. Familier de Rabbouni, ce dernier finira par être arrêté (et débriefé) par les services mauritaniens à Nouadhibou, le 5 décembre 2011. Là encore, cette opération terroriste à connotation religieuse recouvrait une réalité sordide : un règlement de comptes entre trafiquants.      Aucun barrage, aucune patrouille, aucun champ de mines ne pourra empêcher la jeunesse sahraouie de prendre la piste de Tombouctou.  Les autorités algériennes se sont longtemps contentées de mettre en garde la direction du Polisario, preuves à l'appui. À plusieurs reprises, des camions militaires sont venus déposer à l'intérieur des camps les dépouilles de Sahraouis enrôlés dans les rangs du GSPC (puis d'Aqmi), tués lors d'opérations de ratissage. De son côté, le Front a réagi avec embarras, mais sans la vigueur escomptée, se contentant de procéder au « nettoyage » de quelques mosquées suspectes et de remettre pour interrogatoire à la gendarmerie algérienne une dizaine de salafistes du camp d'Aousserd, en juillet 2008.

t5_2qh63,rightc0ast,1352529489,"&gt; Call me cynical, but I don't think listening to Rothbard and Paul everyday made him a very intelligent man. It is always difficult to learn much about a man by one sentence, but this is a guy who walked on a stage, in front of many cameras, and thought this was something he needed to say. He probably thought it was funny, he probably thought it was smart.  It's referred to in the game as throwing red meat. I don't like it, and couldn't personally do it. I think that Ron couldn't either, despite having religious views where inside his head *he's thinking the exact same thing*. Things like this pandering are why I could never get on the stage at the RNC, and why Ron never did.   It's why Rand will probably at least be able to attempt a serious run in a few years. Shifting demographics will probably mean an apology of sorts for this, eventually. Something else his father refused to do. Americans *love* an apology and atonement. Hell, some of our most successful modern politicians have apologized for being in the klan.   I mostly agree with everything else though. Philosophically at least.   The religious baggage makes almost everyone involved suspect, and more to the point, not true libertarians^®  &gt; No one's liberty is limited if homosexuals aren't allowed to marry, but surely gay couples are stripped of certain liberties if it is not allowed.  It's that religious baggage again. It allows a person who has spoken in most other regards in ways that such a stance is really surprising ... yet they can sit there and rationalize it as something not that differnt than this. (note, I disagree. Just pointing it out)  &gt; Look, given the existence of the state itself, and the republican nature of US governance, this is a state's right's issue. Some will allow it, which is their prerogative, but I don't think they should. No one's freedom is limited. All gays are still free to marry, they just choose not to do so. There is no clause that says you *must* love a person you marry, and if they want tax breaks, a gay male and female couple could meet up and get the breaks. They are both free to the same degree you and I are. We are all free to marry a member of the opposite sex. That's marriage. That's the legislation, even though I don't think government should be in the business of marriage at all!  It's hard to swallow ... but inside the head of the person who believes there is a sky king ruling our eternal existence ... it's not something I can't understand if I put myself in their shoes. It's ... unfortunate. ",®

t5_2qh5j,RedBjorn,1352567040,"&gt;Don't rights exist to protect people from vigilante justice?   I'm an anarchist, vigilante justice is the only kind I consider legitimate.  &gt;What qualifies you to be arbiter of what is right and what is wrong?  The same thing that qualifies whatever authority is enforcing rights: nothing. I'm not saying I am the decider of what is actually right and wrong, just that I can come to my own conclusions without prepackaged Morality!™, which unfortunately only comes in the context-free variety.  &gt;What if what you believe is wrong or harmful isn't what I believe is wrong or harmful?  Then we disagree. In addition to rights, I also don't believe in authority so we'll just have to work it out. That's how morality evolves, something it can't really do when constrained by rights.  &gt; For example, say I'm a hardcore social conservative who thinks abortion is mass murder, can you convince me that I'm incorrect in thinking it's wrong? Based on your rubric here, what prevents me from going out and killing doctors because I think they're mass murderers? (hyperbolic example, yes, I know, it's just the first thing that popped into my head)   That's a perfect example of what is wrong with rights. Arbitrarily determining morality without context inevitably leads to picking and choosing who is worthy of rights and who isn't (in your example, valuing being that don't yet exist over beings that do), because you can't protect one person's (or perceived person's) rights without eventually violating another's. Its why I believe all morality should be decided in context.  &gt;This argument and line of reasoning is extremely sophomoric and doesn't account for the complexity of ethics and murky nature of ""wrong"".  I find it to be neither complex nor murky once you relinquish rights and authority, and related imaginary things like value. Without those you are left with objective human equality and moral decisions completely free of the complications that authority and rights bring. Incidentally, ""no rights"" is just ""equal rights"" minus whatever authority presumes to predefine them.",™

His friends think I'm bad news but the issue is that I had an undiagnosed and untreated illness. At the times when I was not in control and said really hurtful things I truly felt that I was valid in my perceptions, but now I see what was really my responsibility.  I now have regular contact with my ex. I have to be really mindful when I am around him though, so I don't fall back into old habits or dynamics of our past relationship. The only way I was capable in regaining a friendship was in going into treatment for BPD. Until of late, he hasn't really understood what BPD is compared to the diagnosis of bipolar which I thought I was when we were together. Also, in the process of treatment I have become more aware of myself, like when my bpd thoughts and behaviors start creeping in. Because of this awareness, I was able to truly apologize for the pain I caused him, a true apology.  It kills me to think I hurt him. But the best thing I can do is keep bettering myself more and more. What I have realized is that I truly love him, not for my selfish needs anymore, but for the beautiful, peaceful, brilliant ( I could go on and on 😊) person he is. He is worth going to Drs. and if in the long run we don't end up together I am going to be a better person either way.  If you don't mind me asking, how long were you two together? Is there realistically a chance you two could get back together? And Why don't you go seek treatment?  If anything is too personal I hope you tell me and then I won't bring it up again unless you like.   Be well friend! I hope you are coping okay! ",😊

I’m a bit of an aloof, quirky, and sometimes depressed girl, and I somehow give the impression of being a bitch even though deep down I truly care about being close to people.    To give some background, I grew up in an EXTREMELY religious household with a mother who was mentally and emotionally unstable.  As soon as I left the church, I ended up in a relationship with someone who was very loving, but also disturbed (and did lots of drugs) and I felt like I didn’t have the chance to discover my new identity outside of religion.  Long story short: I broke up with him hoping to rediscover myself, he went a little crazy and we ended up in an argument that ended in him resorting to physical violence and trashing my apartment…And despite all of that, he found someone else and seems happy. I realize that it can’t have been a healthy relationship to begin with if it ended like that, but every time I look at myself and see a failure because I can’t win over a crowd like some other girls can, I can’t help but think of how comforting the relationship was and of how I had someone who never would have broken up with me. I still blame myself for the way things ended, and it's making me feel too inadequate to even try out new hobbies.   I know the whole complaining about break ups thing may sound whiny, but I would appreciate input on what things any of you have found helpful in overcoming personal flaws and anxiety, starting a life from scratch or just things you enjoy doing by yourself that you think make you a better person to be around!

t5_2ra79,aspophilia,1352680512,"Thank you so much you guys. I will respond individually soon.  He never responded to my request to talk so I wrote this. It pretty much says it all but I am still scared to hit send;  ""I wanted to say this in person. I want to hear your responses and look you in the eyes so I know what you tell me is the truth. So I can let this go knowing I have all the information and that there is no further reason to believe that there is any hope that we'll ever be together. If you were here I'd ask:  ""Do you love me?"" I imagine you would say no.  ""Do you want to be with me?"" I imagine you would say no or that you don't know.   Then I would tell you I love you. More than I've ever loved anyone. That I want to be with you so badly and that I wish we could have another real chance. Because we're good together. We fit. I appreciate your intelligence and understand you better than most people probably do. We are alike. Just being close to you makes me happy. But I know that's not true for you. Despite us being such a great match you want someone else. Someone who doesn't want you. And I think even when she's remarried you will still wait for her.   I didn't lie to you when I said I didn't feel like a booty call. I didn't feel used. But last night when she texted you and you sat right next to me and called her.... something clicked and I realized that I was really just in denial of what we are. Of what I am to you.  The thing is, I love you too much to watch you wait and torture yourself over something that will never happen and I respect myself too much to pine and wait for you like you wait for her. Because unlike you I can see that I have to let go. It's not healthy for either of us to do this. I can't make love to you... kiss you and touch you.... only for you to walk away from me right after like it means nothing when it means everything to me. Despite how close and connected I feel to you when we have sex and how passionate it is, I don't think you feel any of it. And then I cry myself to sleep because I miss you as soon as you go and I know that I will have to practically beg you to come back just so I can go through it all over again.   I'm not sure you care about me at all. Even as a friend. Because if you did, when I say I needed to talk you would be here for me. You would patiently listen to me even if I was saying things you didn't want to hear. And you would be honest with me. You would help me let go. Instead you do to me what has been done to you despite how much you know it hurts. It's not fair. I deserve more from you than that.   I love you with my whole heart. I miss you every moment and I think about what things could be like if we were together. I think about the things we use to talk about after I first emailed you. When you said you could picture us snuggling on the couch on Sunday mornings while the kids played. It was just a fantasy. It wasn't real. But I just want it so badly that I can't let it go.    Knowing you would rather be alone than with me.... that what I have offered you and after giving all of myself to you, that I'm still somehow not good enough.... it's too painful. I've never felt so worthless. I feel like nothing because even at my best you can't love me. Or you won't. Not just that but you won't even try.   I don't know what else to say. I don't know if you will respond to this. I honestly don't think you will. I know it's difficult for you to deal with things like this so you avoid it. It's easier to ignore than to deal with things that might be painful or messy. Easier to stick with the life you know than to change it even if it could be better. Easier to lose someone who loves you than to admit that you might be making the wrong choice.   I want to be your friend but maybe that's too hard right now. I want more than you're willing to give and I can't pretend I want less. I need time maybe, though I don't think it will make me stop loving you.   There is this fantasy in my head where you read this and suddenly realize what you could lose. That you would miss me. That you would tell me you want to try and give us another shot. But it's only a fantasy and I don't hold any hope for it. I'll still love you. For the rest of my life. And if we don't talk anymore after this please know that I will always miss you and I'll always want you. I really want you to be happy and I hope you find what you need.   You have no idea how hard it was for me to write this knowing it could mean you'll be gone and I'll never again get to feel your hands on my face before you kiss me or feel safe as you hold me as i lay next to you in bed. But I can't lie to myself and pretend I'm ok with how things are. If you don't want me I have to learn to accept that and let you go.   Love this powerful is rare and shouldn't be wasted but I heard once or twice that if you really love someone you should set them free. I really love you so I'm doing the only thing I can to prove it.  ❤  http://youtu.be/IwVeH9E6o_0 "" ",❤

t5_2tltc,selfabortion,1352684095,"I've done a fair amount of Kafka study and might be able to toss a couple things your way.  Unfortunately, it has been some years and I don't seem to have as many of my old papers/bibliographies as I'd have expected.  I haven't read any of the following sources in a long time, so the degree to which they help you may vary. If I find anything else, I'll edit and post it here.    Danielle Allen - ""Sounding Silence.""  MODERNISM / modernity. VOLUME EIGHT, NUMBER TWO, PP 325-334. © 2001 THE JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY PRESS  (This one focuses on ""In the Penal Colony,"" at least in the first portion that I re-skimmed.  If you don't have a way to pull the article, PM your e-mail address)  Everyone interested in Kafka owes it to themselves to read ""The Myth of Sisyphus"" by Albert Camus; he spends a lot of time on F.K. in that long essay.  It's a wonderful read, even if not the most academically rigorous.    I wrote a 20 pager that was essentially a Foucauldian interpretation of ""The Trial.""  The following citation is in my bibliography for it and may or may not talk about Kafka to any significant degree.  It has been several years since I wrote the paper though and I don't have access to a journal database to skim this article.   Hassan, Ihab Habib 1925- *Negative Capability Reclaimed: Literature and Philosophy Contra Politics* Philosophy and Literature - Volume 20, Number 2, October 1996, pp. 305-324 – Article  Here is one that mainly focuses on The Trial, but his themes are pretty consistent throughout all of his work, so might be worth a look:   Kundert-Gibbs.  “’I am powerful, and I am only the lowest 	Doorkeeper’: Power Play in Kafka’s The Trial and Pinter’s Victoria Station.”  Pinter at Sixty.  Ed. Katherine Burkman and John Kundert-Gibbs.  	Bloomington: Indiana University Press.  1993.  149-160.    Bonus trivia: Nobel Laureate Harold Pinter co-adapted ""The Trial"" into a pretty good film version, with Kyle MacLachlan (aka Dale Friggin' Cooper!) and Anthony Hopkins.   EDIT - George Steiner and John Updike are both writers of note who have written about Kafka in the introductions to various of his works.  I'd search for their names and Kafka together to see if they have put out anything in addition to those.    Here's another to try that I'm fairly positive I read at some point: [Authority, Autonomy, and Choice: The Role of Consent in the Moral and Political Visions of Franz Kafka and Richard Posner](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1737920)  Another thing: Walter Benjamin is a pretty heavyweight theorist who I believe has written a moderate amount about Franz Kafka.  Try searching any journal databases you have access to for items with both of those names.  ",©

And it's kind of like gazing into the abyss too at times, depending on the subreddit. Either way, it's probably too late for you to flee since you've already posted. I used to lurk for a while, and that was relatively benign. Then I started posting, and then the karma lust kicks in and now I spend my nights with insomnia. That's the Reddit Experience™!  Me? I just post here and there all the time, never really staying in one place for long, aside from the /r/mylittlesupportgroup subreddit. I keep telling myself I ought to branch out more. You're probably doing it right.   Debates are fun! Philosophy debates in particular. Are you much for those?  And maybe you can answer this for me... what's the deal with Skype? Is it primarily used as an instant-messenger? I've almost always considered it more of a VoIP application. Is there any kind of etiquette rule when it comes to Skype?",™

His people then lied about that.  Then we got a bill that was a huge giveaway to the industry.  In this case then, a private meeting isn't just a private meeting, it's hypocrisy in action.  If it was GWB, you'd agree, but it's ""Your Guy™"" so you cover for him.  Naturally.  &gt;He had a majority in both houses for about seven weeks and he never had a super majority in the house. Your knowledge of civics or possibly, your math skills need improvement.  Again.  The bill was passed in budget reconciliation where only a simple majority was needed.  Simple majority, not supermajority.  So now what's your excuse for the corporate givaway bill we got?

t5_2qh1a,pnpbios,1352732089,"Wayland is an implementation of EGL on Linux. What is EGL, you are asking?  &gt; EGL™ is an interface between Khronos rendering APIs such as OpenGL ES or OpenVG and the underlying native platform window system. It handles graphics context management, surface/buffer binding, and rendering synchronization and enables high-performance, accelerated, mixed-mode 2D and 3D rendering using other Khronos APIs.  Right now, Most hardware OpenGL implementations communicate from inside X using DRI2, meaning that X needs to be up and running before you can start making calls.  Wayland goes around this, because it offers a more direct path to the hardware. You can instance your OpenGL context wherever in the boot process you like, so long as the kernel has the right modules. Essentially, loading the graphical subsystem could be in run level 1 instead of run level 5.   ",™

t5_2cneq,Wiskeyjac,1352750481,"Ok, you're going to get a lot of flack over this one, and in part that's justified, but I'm going to go off of the assumption that you're a bright young man/woman/cabbage and have just stumbled onto the concept of the Illuminati and Worldwide Conspiracy™   Now, these are exciting things for a few reasons.  1. First of all, it's a nice, complete, explanation of Why Things Are The Way They Are.  It presents an exciting narrative (Ancient Secret Societies), presents a clear villain (The Illuminati Who Control Everything), and weaves in just enough real-world facts that it has a hint of truth to it.  It tells a tale of how we got here, and presents a clear picture in an otherwise muddy world.  2. On the subject of a clear picture, the Illuminati conspiracy story has another factor in its favor: It's a black and white picture.  There are Bad Guys™ controlling everything.  There are Good Guys™ desperately trying to get the word out to the unwitting populace, risking everything for the sake of The Truth™.  The story explains a very complicated world in a very simple way.  People cling to conspiracy stories for much the same reason they may cling to religion, or any other myth: it makes the world a less scary place because, as bad as things may be, at least there's order to the world.  3.  Finally, one of the most satisfying things about conspiracy stories is that they reassure the believer that the bad things are not their fault.  ""It's not your fault we treat black people/the poor/homosexuals/etc like shit, the all-powerful Illuminati have made it that way.""  In these stories you can, and should, fight that organization but it's not your fault if you can't make a positive impact.  In fact, your inability to affect the status quo or to make anyone else believe in the story just reinforces how powerful the Illuminati is (in the story).  So, in the end, look on stories like the Illuminati as you would any other myth:  There are some truths to be found in there --about how to act in a hostile world, for example-- but it is not literal truth.  Heck, if you want a laugh at the whole thing I'd recommend Robert Anton Wilson's Illuminatus Trilogy.  It's a bit dated, and stuck in '60s counterculture, but it's a nice teardown of the Illuminati story.",™

t5_2qm4e,aywwts4,1352756786,"http://www.princeton.edu/~oa/safety/hypocold.shtml has a lot to say on the effects of fuel and glucose to warm the body and treat hypothermia. If you ran out of calories and glucose shivering stops sooner and you die sooner, not just ""Starvation"".   Shivering - generates heat through increase in chemical reactions required for muscle activity. Visible shivering can maximally increase surface heat production by 500%. However, this is limited to a few hours because of depletion of muscle glucose and the onset of fatigue.   The basic principles of rewarming a hypothermic victim are to conserve the heat they have and replace the body fuel they are burning up to generate that heat. If a person is shivering, they have the ability to rewarm themselves at a rate of 2 degrees C per hour.    Moderate  2. Add Fuel &amp; Fluids  It is essential to keep a hypothermic person adequately hydrated and fueled.  a. Food types  Carbohydrates - 5 calories/gram - quickly released into blood stream for sudden brief heat surge - these are the best to use for quick energy intake especially for mild cases of hypothermia Proteins - 5 calories/gram - slowly released - heat given off over a longer period Fats - 9 calories/gram - slowly released but are good because they release heat over a long period, however, it takes more energy to break fats down into glucose - also takes more water to break down fats leading to increased fluid loss b. Food intake  Hot liquids - calories plus heat source Sugars (kindling) GORP - has both carbohydrates (sticks) and protiens/fats (logs)  Severe  Warm Sugar Water - for people in severe hypothermia, the stomach has shut down and will not digest solid food but can absorb water and sugars. Give a dilute mixture of warm water with sugar every 15 minutes. Dilute Jello™ works best since it is part sugar and part protein. This will be absorbed directly into the blood stream providing the necessary calories to allow the person to rewarm themselves. One box of Jello = 500 Kilocalories of heat energy. Do not give full strength Jello even in liquid form, it is too concentrated and will not be absorbed. ",™

So I looked at both of those ones you recommended and my only concern is I currently have a ATI Radeon™ HD 5750 Graphics card  which supposedly needs a 450 Watt PSU.

t5_2s4wg,caferrell,1352808508,"In reviewing your question, it looks like we didn't really answer your question, at least not directly. So, this is my take on who benefits from the endless war.   - Defense contractors, including both arms manufacturers and security companies (spies and mercenaries). No wars, no growth. No growth, no contracts.   - the top military brass. Advancement to general rank and above happens very slowly or not at all during peacetime. When the Pentagon is at war, and especially when there are multiple wars or multiple fronts in a war, then promotions happen rapidly. These men have great influence over US military policy, and as of the beginning of the War on Muslims, they have great influence over foreign policy.  - Israel. America's wars against Muslims divert attention from the real security problem in the Mideast, which is Israel and its treatment of the Palestinians. Under cover of the Endless War that started eleven years ago, Israel has expanded greatly into the occupied territories until a Palestinian state has become an impossibility. I wager that war with Iran will include the forced expulsion of Palestinians from their own land.   - Pro-war think tanks. This means most Washington foreign policy think-tanks. When the US is on a war footing, there is ample money available to finance these fancy bloviators. It is only a drop of money, compared to the river of money spent by the government, but it is important because these outfits provide the seemingly rational justifications for the American self-destructive foreign policy.   - The [Primary Dealer Banks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_dealer). The wars increase spending. That spending increase is not limited to defense and intelligence because law-makers sell their votes on defense authorizations for votes on their social spending programs. Therefore Bush's GWT™ also brough us Medicare Part D and ""No Child Left Behind"". As government spending increases way beyond government revenue, the deficit must be financed by issuing debt. That debt and the transfers of that debt between the Primary Dealers and the Fed create a river of free money for the banks.

t5_2qh0y,lexyeevee,1352836351,"You know I still have a soft spot for Perl, and you know I know the language fairly well, but I still remember _exactly_ why Python felt like such a breath of fresh air.  It was three things, really.  **Data structures.**  I was so, so sick of having to slap `@{...}` and `%{...}` all over the place in any code that did more than set a few keys or tried to be remotely clever.  Especially when wrapped in a `map` block, and maybe then wrapped in an anonymous hashref; that is too many levels of different braces.  This is somewhat better in current Perl, where the builtins understand references.  Current Perl wasn't around when I switched to Python.  :)  **Cheap classes.**  I don't mean in the sense of ""classes are really hard in perl, wahh"".  I mean in the sense of _I write one line and now I have a class_.  I don't have to make a `package` declaration (or, more likely, a new file) and import something; I just say ""this is a class"" and then it is a class.  The difference in effort sounds small, but it felt like a huge barrier was removed.  In Perl, classes feel like a scarce resource that I should dole out carefully; in Python, they're just another language feature.  **Exception handling.**  Low blow.  Sorry.  But it _works_ in Python.  It half-works a thousand different ways in Perl.  Also pretty nice: **first-class keyword arguments**, eliminating a problem Perl still can't agree on how to solve.  **Bound methods** were a surprising nicety, too, though hardly switch-worthy.  And while I _despised_ the **whitespace** at first, it has since occurred to me that I was delimiting blocks once for humans and once for computers, and now braces just feel like worthless noise.  I do miss some clever tricks from Perl, like `import` shenanigans and syntax extensions via `sub(&amp;)` and dynamic scoping♥ and Moose's freeish type constraints.  But Perl also lacks Python's bag of tricks, like decorators and first-class metaclasses and generators.  And I think Python's metaprogramming on the whole is slightly more approachable and looks somewhat less like black magic.    _Addendum:_ There is one other very major and understated advantage Python has here, and that is that it is **replicatable**.  That is, someone else can build an alternative Python interpreter and be reasonably confident that it can be compatible with stock Python.  In fact, this has happened multiple times, to great effect: we have Cython for writing C extensions with Python syntax (compare XS, good lord), we have Jython and IronPython if that's your bag, and we have an extremely promising JIT experiment in PyPy.  Perl has `perl`.",♥

t5_2rdsl,Mabeline,1352872774,"t;a is still much more similar to whatever the hell it was in early beta than any other tribes game.  most of the problems with the game stem from 3 things, the class system, health regeneration, and the physics. everything else (sniper wtfbroken, can't add depth in the form of asset play, blah blah) follows from those fundamental problems.  the physics are at the core of these issues. t;a tried to make the physics accessible to new users but ended up making a set of physics that is woefully inadequate when you want to play at a decent level. the physics are super floaty and there's a bunch of Weird Shit™ that all create their own nasty little imbalances. seriously, jets accelerate you at a fraction of their initial speed over ~72kph, gravity is capped at ~280kph downwards, gravity acceleration is ramped down as you go over ~185kph (in any direction!), for fuck's sake, **your explosives literally do 60% as much impulse to yourself as they do to others**  the only reason that you can even jet most of the time is because the jetpacks straight up *turn off gravity*, otherwise they'd be far to weak to do anything. hell, on bella omega if you started falling down the conduit it was actually faster to fall all the way to the bottom of the tower and jet back up than it was to try and turn around using your jetpack. that shit is broken in arena, broken in tdm, and it's *sure as hell* broken in ctf.  while we're talking about it, health regeneration just straight up breaks everything. being able to freely regenerate all the health you lost, all while moving, drastically imbalances the game. cappers grab with near full health, having paid nearly nothing in the speed for health/time tradeoff that every other player on the map must obey. cappers already have the advantage of time, this just pushes them way over the edge. the only things that really compensate for that imbalance are mines and sentinels.  the class system is the last big one. the 2 weapon system forces classes to be one dimensional, which has a lot of secondary effects. the biggest offender here is the sentinel (with all of the heavy classes getting honorable mention).  the sentinel is always going to be either ridiculously overpowered or useless because the laser rifle is essentially it's only useful weapon for engaging people. with simple 3 weapon loadouts (assuming proper physics &amp; disc jumping) you would be able to put a laser rifle on a disc/chain light and not have it be overpowered because you can move the weapon into a utility role.  when you have more than 2 weapons it's not completely devastating that the laser rifle is only going to put a few hundred damage on someone because that's not the only purpose of the sentinel. instead of needing the laser rifle to even participate in playing the game, you can fall back on your other weapons to allow you to control terrain/air with disc/chain.  dueling is always going to be hampered by 2 weapons. the classic disc/chain/nade loadout makes duels almost *fun* when properly balanced and combined with a responsive set of physics.  the class system has other secondary effects like artificially injecting way too many weapons into the game and preventing any sort of deeper play. weapon pickups can't really happen, which straight up breaks real base play, and you can't really differentiate the classes in a useful way with higher weapon counts. a medium is really just a fat light when medium doesn't have the advantage of being able to specialize without huge versatility penalties.  it's all 'fixable', but it doesn't seem the developers feel its broken",™

t5_2sc5r,klepas,1352907041,"I’m writing on this topic tangentially at the moment (I’m looking at his perspectivism and experimentalism).  I’ll list a few relevant sections and then make a note on how I read Nietzsche re. logic (and subsequently knowledge).  From his corpus I’d say the Gay Science has a lot on your topic(s), and its treatments are well worth reading. In particular, check:  * §109: *Let us beware.*—nature of the universe and our anthropomorphisms; idea of de-deification/reintegration into nature; * §110: *Origin of knowledge.*—the idea of the incorporation of truth as a condition of life (probably worth reading OTL first); * **§111: *Origin of the logical.*—**origin? logic/illogic; the basic idea of there being ‘equal’ things; follows from §110 on the evolutionary nature of these ideas, as in, how they benefitted a species; * **§112: *Cause and effect.*—**worth reading for so many reasons, but specifically as this is positioned immediately after the origin of knowledge and logic which precede it. * §115: *The four errors.*—might as well… (flows from the others) * **§121: *Life no argument.*—**the conditions of life may include ‘error’… * **§335: *Long live physics!*—**a slightly longer, but brilliant section. Well worth reading for the sentiment and ideas of logic, knowledge, the objects of knowledge, causality, …  (Most of the start of book three—which starts with §108—is worth reading. The line of inquiry and the ideas are related in ways that keep me re-reading them, finding new and intriguing things most times. They also relate strongly to many other parts of his corpus, and contain some of the core motifs of his work.)  §§354–355 are also worth reading as they continue his earlier thoughts on the origin of knowledge.  Reading §112 and §335 together and looking for links and ideas between the two is well worth it.  Edit: TL/OTL—On Truth and Lies in a Extra-Moral Sense/On Truth and Lies in a Non-Moral Sense (I prefer the former, as it’s closer to the German (*Über Wahrheit und Lüge im außermoralischen Sinn*). It’s freely available online in PDF/doc/whatever. In many aspects this is staple, although it precedes the Gay Science and many of his later works that followed in the 18880s. It’s just a short essay and quite a nice read (even here his use of language is quite… captivating—it’s a worthy read).  As for general text availability, (more on that below) Wikipedia/Wikisource should also have a lot of Nietzsche’s stuff, though translations might not be as good as that of Kaufmann (which is what I’ve found—I really prefer Kaufmann’s as they are much ‘truer’ to the original German, which I read too).  If you don’t have access to a copy of The Gay Science I believe the Kaufmann translations are available online somewhere, and they’re dirt cheap (like $5–10, if that) from most online bookstores. Happy to also point you in the direction of even further reading if you like. :3  ===  Now, as for your questions…  My own reading is that, no, Nietzsche would not accept a logical proof for the existence of God… a meta-narrative deity figure?—given his writing on theology, the death of God, the shadows of the dead God, … etc.—certainly not. As for logic generally… my take is he would not discount it—it has usefulness (it’s has become the cornerstone of our computing in many ways). I do not see him refuting it as it being either outright ‘false’ or egregious, **but** must be considered in relation to the idea of ‘truth’. If there can only be a perspectival truth, that is rooted contextually to the time, the ‘subject’, and how they inscribe themselves in the world, then a system of logic that deems that there are things that are equal, or that we could presume mutual inclusivity/exclusivity becomes suddenly complex and problematised.  For example, I feel he would refuse to accept that the [law of noncontradiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_noncontradiction) was primeval and somehow intrinsic to the world, the universe, and it’s just a dandy happenstance that we humans crawling on this planet were smart enough—apart from the millions of other species that preceded us on this planet alone, and even now—to ‘discover’ or figure such a thing out. Nietzsche’s perspectivism would challenge the LNC, for these two statements that would otherwise be mutually exclusive could be both be true, at the same time, in the same sense, from different perspectives (and contexts). And this ‘truth’ cannot be denied to any of the perspectives, for they hold true for that person under that perspective, time, context, …. (Alenka Zupančič has written on this in the latter half of her book *The Shortest Shadow*, specifically taking the idea of a point-of-view as ≠ the gaze of a ‘subject’, which extends the idea of Nietzsche’s perspectivism as being more than the mere PoV of a subject. See below on the subject–object dialectic.) For him, all these concepts are *ours*, and given perspectivism, cannot be held to somehow be absolutely, positively true above all, to all, as a fundamental law (following from §121):  &gt; *Life no argument.*—We have arranged for ourselves a world in which we can live—by positing bodies, lines, planes, causes and effects, motion and rest, form and content; without these articles of faith nobody now could endure life. But that does not prove them. Life is no argument. The conditions of life might include error.  In this sense ‘logic’ is a cognitive requirement per se, which we have developed over a *long* time. By now we’ve honed it (that does not by any means require it to be *‘better’*), and then made use of it for everything under the sun (including morality). Further, we can’t demonstrate that these laws of logic have a direct counterpart from which we deduce them in the world, nor, necessarily, that they apply to other species.  The same thus applies to mathematics. We cannot do away with them ‘entirely’, as they are functional (either evolutionarily, or, now technologically) necessities upon which our lives are now conditional—we rely upon them for so much. However, and crucially I think, Nietzsche, wants us to tickle the idea that ‘untruth’ or error can be a condition of life… (see Beyond Good and Evil §4 here too).  At this point it’s actually quite interesting to see how some of these sections elude to the idea that these ideas—which carry an *ontological character*—are subtly, but firmly embossed syntactically in our language (language does not ‘objectively’ represent reality…). It’s incredibly difficult to think, as it were, from a position outside of the human; from a ‘neutral’, ‘perfectly’ or ‘purely rational’ or disinterested position—it’d be an absurd impossibility. We remain looking at “life from within life itself”, and Nietzsche wants to *affirm* that (to do otherwise is the deny or negate life, viz., *asceticism*). (There is some stuff I’ve come across which actually toys with the idea of Nietzsche as poking at some of the limitations of the subject–object dialectic here, but I’m still poking my toes into the water in that regard, Zupančič being one.)  Mhh. In closing, my feeling really is that Nietzsche, in casting doubt over these domains of epistemology, logic, philosophy, science, … is not just casting their methodologies into doubt and question, but chiefly, their premises. They rest on a *very* different conception of ‘truth’ from that which he has developed—cf. foundationalism, positivism, or those of idealism, or even the Kantian real/apparent distinction…—and most importantly, having questioned and displaced these premises, all these questions of epistemology suddenly (also…) become *ontological* in character—they concern the nature of being itself (of *being*, and of *becoming*). We cannot endure a science that denies this character, and must come to a new, more vibrant, audacious, experimental, playful, perspectival way of being (ala «a *gay science*»).  ===  **Note on Nietzsche’s language and “objectivity”:**  I just wanted to add an additional note with respects to Nietzsche’s choice of language in some of the above sections. First off, be wary of investing into common value judgements (i.e. moral evaluations) of things like ‘stronger’, ‘weaker’, ‘the herd’, and orders of rank (‘higher’/‘lower’). These carry a different meaning than what we today commonly attribute to them (e.g. strong = better; weak = bad). If you’re keen on reading more and being sensitive to Nietzsche’s use of these adjectives reading Genealogy of Morals is vital.  As for “objectivity”: Nietzsche rejects this as *an ideal* (and a severely delimiting one at that). Perspectivism ≠ pure relativism, that is, it’s not just a case of accepting that others may see or understand thing X in a different manner to you, and that thus experiences are subjectively mediated (and thus knowledge and ‘truth’ correspondingly carries this subjective element which *must thus be accounted for*). No—Nietzsche’s perspectivism extends beyond this. We cannot ‘attain’ or ‘yield’ or necessarily even come ‘closer’ to an “objective knowledge” by ‘adding up’ all our perspectives, as if it would reveal all/more/as many aspects of an object. Nietzsche rejects that an object carries intrinsic properties that we must thus embark to discover—this is an outright rejection of previous metaphysical narratives, including—especially—Kant’s the thing-in-itself. To posit the existence of such a (noumenal) realm (or any other system of epistemology/science/philosophy that does anything similar) relocates the question of truth to the metaphysical (*…shadows of the dead God…*), a *metaphysical truth*.  &gt; *This reflecting on the reflection is the surest way to avoid the question of the gaze, a question that most certainly does not coincide with the point from which we look at things and reflect upon them.* **The fundamental disjunction at stake in any process of knowledge is the disjunction between the “perspectival point” from which we look at things** (the standpoint or viewpoint) **and the point of the gaze (this being the place of the subject in the thing).** The true question concerns not where we stand when we are reflecting on a certain object, but, rather, **where we stand within this object itself.** (*The Shortest Shadow*, pp. 107–108)  Further (same page, IIRC):  &gt; The crucial point here is not to understand this in the all too common fashion: as the stance according to which all objects are constructed by something (be it the subject, or some sort of discourse) other than the object itself. The point is quite different: if all objects are constructed in the process of knowledge (or, for instance, in the process of speech about them), it is precisely because there is an irreducible object-element in them (in the pursuit of which we “construct” the object). To put it differently: if objective reality is constituted, not simply given, this is because something of the order of the object is given. What stands in the way of the ideal of purely objective knowledge is not some subjective element, but, rather, an element of the object itself. And I am not talking about some inert matter that the subject’s gaze can never penetrate; I am talking about the gaze itself as the (irreducible) object-within-the-object.  [This coincides with N. on the ‘unknowability of actions’, of the new, and the general idea of an excess of life all definitions of life (hitherto, and generally)—hence his call for an affirmation of life and its disclosures…]  Zupančič makes use of the Lacanian concept of ‘the gaze’ here, but I feel like the point comes across (it’s been a few years since I’ve touched the little Lacan I’ve done, and having just read the relevant passages of Nietzsche I feel like I can tag along fine). This is essentially a reiteration of the above, that our point of view and our ‘gaze’ do not coincide. We ‘objectify’ reality under the subject–object dialectic (for that is how we relate today at a meta-level to the world, viz., “I am a *subject* that senses *objects*…”), and we invest or ‘inscribe’ ourselves into the very objects which we constitute (conceptually, through language, through speech, …). In this sense we are ourselves constituted in and through the objects which we perceive and then ‘understand’/render intelligible/… (there’s another problem here too: the presumption of ‘wholeness’ in objects). Again, there is no innate ‘intelligibility’ or “intelligible character/essence of things” (again cf. Kant, idealism, foundationalism, positivism, …).  And thus, to bring it back to logic, any system of logic that is placed on a pedestal, as a metaphysical truth, from which we proceed denies Nietzsche’s perspectivism, his conception of truth, his understanding of language; his understanding of life, being, and becoming. Systems of logic are useful to us—we may utilise them toward some goal, but the possibilities of deriving this truth or that falsity are preset and conditional upon the basic presumptions he outlined in the early parts of GS: III (e.g. presumption of existence of equal entities, presumption of mutual inclusivity/exclusivity, and precisely *what* we hold to be equal/unequal, inclusive/exclusive—again, presumption of ‘wholeness’ also). A perspectivist approach would clash with any such system that replaces previous elevations of truth upon the metaphysical pedestal once held by ‘God’ (God is dead… shadows of the dead God…).  ===  I hope that wasn’t too long and didn’t venture too far off your questions. For quite a while I was skeptical of his treatment of logic too, but having read more of his corpus, specifically on his perspectivism I feel like I can better grasp what he is getting at, and how he feels warranted in defenestrating logic (which is what it read like upon a first glance).  (disclaimer) This is my reading of Nietzsche, directed in part by the course I’m doing. Also, I smashed this out in like ~~15~~ 30 minutes so I may have missed some crucial sections… :s  This stuff messes with my mind (and I kinda ♥ it). Any other Nietzscheans keen to wade in here? (:  ===  **tl;dr:** working from different conceptions of ‘truth’; logic, maths, … cause and effect, … etc. are conditions of life (in a variety of regards, esp. over time); read first 25 or so aphorisms of GS: III; ‘will to truth’ … knowledge as more than mere utility; life as a means to knowledge; a view of life from within life itself; importance of affective states; perspectivism.",♥

So tell yourself you are beautiful, breath and relax :)    Enjoy yourself :) although tough, transitioning is super rewarding, and so worth it!      ♥",♥

t5_2qh9z,Alignmed,1352919332,"EBA clients and customers include world-renowned medical centers, professional sporting teams, soccer moms, and active retirees. We have input from over 20,000 individuals and 1400 physicians who have used and recommended EBA garments. These people represent a varied population that includes major universities, renowned medical clinics, physical therapists, strength coaches, computer users, surgeons, law enforcement, soccer moms, Air Force Academy, active retirees, and professional athletes from the NFL, MLB, NBA, NHL, Pro Tennis, MLS, etc... No one is exempt from the stress and strains of their environment. EBA customers are people who care about body preservation or find that the products are an amazing means to make themselves look good!  EBA® posture improvement devices are built with state of the art materials that feature moisture wicking, anti-microbial, and biocompatible properties that meet the demands of advanced physical activity. EBA technology behind the solutions is based on the basic science principles of balance, form and function. EBA designs form fitting garments with variable tension bands called ""Neurobands"". Neurobands stimulate muscles and nerves to align the body’s joints with each stride of the leg or movement of the hip, back, shoulder, chest and neck; in response the body uses less energy and reduced fatigue means less vulnerability to injury. EBA is anatomic apparel that backed with clinical findings from prestigious medical research institutions. EBA garments offer an alternative to individuals with concerns related to muscular, neurological, and postural strain, or to those who simply seek wellness solutions. The company is committed to understanding the interactions of multiple biological responses in the human body and to integrate them into apparel that is comfortable and attractive.  Over time, the aspects of modern life and aging can be as hard on the body as the challenges in sport. We are not designed for long periods of static, sedentary work. The body thrives on movement and variety. Mother Nature did not design our bodies for long periods of repetitive motions such as sitting or keyboard use. Work-related musculoskeletal repetitive stress injuries (RSIs) are the fastest growing category of work-related illness. Across North America, half of all workers' compensation claims are due to MSI, the most common being low back pain, carpal tunnel syndrome; shoulder pain, and neck pain. It is estimated that over 50% of all RSIs can be prevented. Most work-related musculoskeletal injuries result through risk factors attributed to awkward postures. These risk factors arise from poorly designed workstations and equipment condition, but the biggest rise is due to the computer terminal and the physical stresses it places on joints, muscles, nerves, tendons, bones, general comfort and health. Especially in the hip area!  EBA garment solutions stimulate muscles to joints balance while simultaneously allowing you to move easier without restriction, to do things more efficiently and less prone to injury. It doesn’t matter if you are climbing the corporate ladder, shipping supplies, or sitting at a desk in front of a computer terminal; EBA solutions require only a form fitting garment that can be worn as outer or under clothing.",®

It seems as though the new patents that were awarded to Taiyo Kagaku are for mineral formulations in combination with L-theanine, as well as exclusive rights to sell it for specific applicaitons. [Source](http://www.nutraingredients-usa.com/Industry/New-patent-protects-Suntheanine-PMS-claim)  &gt;Taiyo Kagaku Co., Ltd., Japan has been awarded several manufacturing and use patents for Suntheanine®, which they have begun to strictly enforce. The patents cover several applications which include reducing anxiety, suppressing behavior problems of pets, reducing PMS symptoms, promoting relaxation, etc.  ___________________________________________________  &gt;The granting of a new US patent to Japan's Taiyo Kagaku for the use of pure form L-theanine brand Suntheanine with minerals to alleviate PMS symptoms  ______________________  So it looks like they own the patents for specific combination formulas and manufacturing techniques, as well as use patents for animal anxiety, women's health, etc. It does not appear that they hold the exclusive rights to the levorotory isomer anymore (if they ever did).

t5_2smhl,EonOmega,1352988588,"Okay. Pantheon actually has sustain in top lane, which nobody realizes. It's called Doran's Blades and the Vamp Mastery. This, in addition with his E's passive gives Pantheon some actually decent sustain. (Each hit is a crit, so you get back 200%. 9% lifesteal is 18% lifesteal, etc.)  He can sustain fairly well with this. If you want to take Pantheon top lane, you need to realize two things very quickly.    A: Pantheon needs to poke to kill.  B: Pantheon generally sucks at dueling.   Pantheon is great at skirmishing, and can duel when he's sufficiently fed, but he capitalizes much better when he can poke people down.  However, top lane is where the bruisers go, and you need to be able to counter that.   You want to be able to beat the shit out of any lane you're up against. Some lanes are easier than others, but in all lanes, you need to utilize Pantheon's skill tricks.  Firstly: Pantheon's passive + W makes for exceptional skirmishing. When towerdiving, you can go in with your passive up, Q them, autoattack, W them, autoattack(or E if you can aim and compensate for their movements but honestly if they're below 15% it's crit-crit-city so hit them.), and then Q them again for the finisher. (Ignite at the beginning/end depending on how humiliating you want to be etc etc.)  Pantheon does well against lanes that are not Lee Sin or Lee Sin's asinine brother Shen. Basically people who have armor steriods, mad sustain, and annoying stick-power are people Pantheon hates.   Pantheon capitalizes on taking advantage of fuckups.  When you kill your enemy lane, you want to gank. You have the POWER because you're PANTHEON, MANLEAP MASTER.  You go GANK bot lane get a DOUBLE KILL and walk back into your lane feeling like a boss. Like no seriously Pantheon can pull some sicknasty ganks off after 6 so just shove your lane, buy, then gank bot or some shit.  Pantheon loves AD. If you buy defensive items that don't have AD on them, you should feel bad because you are bad. Doran's blades, Brutalizer, Hexdrinker, Last Whisper, Phage, these are all earlygame items that Pantheon likes and can get to help capitalize on his abuse of AD. If he is crushing his lane so badly that they want to commit seppuku, he can get ""The Riven Build™"", or ""Bloodthirster GA"".   Basically, Pantheon is a poke laner and your friend should play him like one. If he absolutely needs mana, he should go something like armor yellows and mp/5 blues. He needs the armor for top lane unless he's vs vlad in which case poke that bitch down and kill him.  ",™

The Marine Commander can spam a Battery for every room if he really wanted to do so and assuming he actually knows how to arrange the guns, they can be a *tremendous* irritation. If you want to actually maximize their value, every single player has to go Gorge and then you're hamstringing your team with no real offense lifeforms that blew 19 res on Gorge and relatively worthless Hydras.  ---  On top of being limited per-Gorge and not per-Room...  1. Sentries have 500 health and 100 armor. Hydras are 350/10 when built and 450/50 when ""mature"". (The fuck?) 2. Sentries cost 5 TRes for the gun and 10 TRes for the Battery, so 15 TRes. A single Hydra costs 10 PRes in the Gorge and 3 per Hydra, so 13 PRes. But wait: PRes rate is 0.125 that of TRes rate, which means it takes 8 times as long to get the resources to place them! (The fuck?) 3. Sentries have a hit-scan weapon. Hydras have a projectile weapon. Hydras can actually miss. (That said, they *are* 360° view versus the Sentries being 160°.) 4. Sentries take 3 seconds to construct, the Battery takes 5 seconds. The Hydra, excluding Gorge Time™, takes 10 seconds to build. (The fuck?) 5. The Wiki doesn't have a value for it but I'm pretty confident that Sentries have a *significantly* longer range than Hydras. (This wouldn't be such an issue if Hydras couldn't miss and also had a range that was actually useful. Some tech point ceilings are actually slightly too high for Hydras to hit Marines directly underneath them... The fuck?) 6. (Note: I don't know the accuracy of the Wiki in this but I'll still include it.) Sentries (allegedly) deal Structural damage, Hydras deal Normal damage. What does this mean? Sentries get double damage against buildings. Why? Who knows. (As for Normal damage, if you're curious: Damage is 1:1 for health and 1:0.5 for armor, so armor absorbs 2 points of Normal damage.)  I'm not going to try and interpret the damage readings on the Wiki for the Sentry. It says a minimum of 3 up to a maximum of 20 versus 15 per Hydra Spike.  Nothing but drawbacks and the only time I've found Hydras even marginally useful is against Marines that are too stupid to push against my Gorge Base. And even then, I have to stack them on top of one another so that they can focus fire enough damage to kill ONE Marine.",™

t5_2qhb9,B_boru,1353001623,"The government is currently considering new legislation regarding cannabis in order to allow the sale of sativex. It is expected that the legislation will be put forward in the new year.    ""Sativex is the world’s first prescription medicine derived from the cannabis plant. The medicine is standardized by both composition and dose and is being developed for the treatment of conditions such as spasticity in multiple sclerosis, cancer pain, and neuropathic pain of various origins  Sativex is administered as an oral spray which is absorbed by the patient’s mouth. Sativex® contains active ingredients called ‘cannabinoids’, which are extracted from cannabis plants grown and processed under strictly controlled conditions. It is composed primarily of a 1:1 ratio of two cannabinoids-CBD (cannabidiol-a non-psychoactive cannabinoid) and THC (delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol). The CBD:THC formulation is believed to enhance the therapeutic benefits of THC while modulating the unwanted psychotropic and other THC-related side effects, such as tachycardia. The spray delivery system keeps THC from entering the blood too rapidly and also minimizes the development of unwanted psychotropic effects.""  It will be interesting how the government can legislate that chemicals in a bottle are fine but the same chemicals on a leaf or bud are not.   The main difference will be the delivery system , using a spray rather than smoking.  But in general it is great that the media and general public seem to be educating themselves (even those that don't use or even want to use cannabis but also see that they should not deny it to others). Finally we might see the people of Ireland drag themselves into the 21st century and a step closer to true individual freedoms. ",®

t5_2cneq,trai_dep,1353007132,"Ironically, it’s not hard to come up with a scenario that is reasonable, at least from the militia’s perspective, to launch a military operation in Benghazi.  1) Two of their members were being held for “interrogation” in a “suite” there. (Thanks to Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo, concerns of torture would be reasonable). These are a direct blow-back of Conservatives’ Global War on Terror™.  2) The area was already awash in protests, thanks to the video posted by Conservative Christians &amp; conmen, providing a perfect cover.  3) Conservative Congress had already cut embassy security funds, ensuring that they wouldn’t be protected to the extent that was required (embassies, let alone counsels, which are even lower priority).  4) Local militia take advantage of the above, using the organic protests as a cover. As often happens in these situations, facts on the ground are confusing and conflicting, with blended motives and events, making it difficult to figure out what’s going on. Resulting in predictable (but honest) misstatements.   5) The CIA briefs various people, including WH personnel, of the confusing situation, also blending Egyptian riots (a reasonable assumption). It takes several days for things to sort themselves out.  6) Normal Fog of War situation. Shrug, learn, move on. Don’t make the same mistake again. Mourn our losses.  The ironic thing is that a) the Mohammed video DID play a crucial role, giving the militia cover. And many of the levers on this can be traced to Conservative policies/initiatives. #s 1-3 are a **direct** consequence of the American Right Wing making fertile ground for the Benghazi attack. It’s quite arguable that they are to blame more than any other US group for this, besides the militia attacking the consulate, of course.  Conservatives *really* hate America.",™

I hope you have a few tiers of payments; if not perhaps think about that?  The iPhone app goes up the front as your Complete Solution® package - and you can also give it a higher à la carte price if you like too? The re-branding is a result of re-thinking what you mean to the market now and reflecting that increased value and skills that you're able to bring.

t5_2qxih,v1sper,1353054715,"&gt;Hello everyone! We appreciate you joining us to play Star Wars™: The Old Republic™, and we hope you enjoy the game. As MMORPGs are large and complex projects, inevitably we do discover issues that may affect gameplay. We're working constantly to fix anything that will affect the player experience, but for now this is our current list of high priority in-game known issues. Please note that this is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all bugs that the developers are working on. Also, we encourage you to report any issues that you do not see on this list via the in-game /bug feature.   **UPDATED: November 15th, 2012**   **General**  * There is not currently an indication for Free-to-Play players to inform them that their characters are not able to use guild repair funds.  * While using looping emotes (such as /dance), players may be unable to open certain containers or unlock abilities. * Preferred Status Players are given an incorrect message indicating their maximum number of GTN sales. * Free-to-Play Guild Leaders are currently not able to view default rank permissions.  * If players have selected ""Hide Head Slot"", cinematics will briefly display helmets before they disappear. * Some emotes may have incorrect voice overs or display the wrong text in the chat window. * If players join a group conversation via holocall, their preset mood emote will not function and cannot be set.  * French and German versions may be missing proper text for tooltips, item descriptions, vendor tabs, or titles.   **Cartel Market**  * Free-to-Play and Preferred Players are incorrectly allowed to purchase the Legacy Fleet Pass item from the Cartel Market when it has no benefit for them.  * The button on the sale tab of the GTN that allows you to purchase additional sale slots is not visible after a player purchases the 4th sale slot upgrade, even though a 5th sale slot upgrade is available in the Cartel Market. * Characters who have already obtained HK-51 are not currently prevented from purchasing him as an unlock in the Cartel Market.  * Characters with Level 50 are not currently prevented from purchasing or using Experience Boosts.  * Characters with Valor Rank 100 are not currently prevented from purchasing or using Cartel Market Valor Boosts. * Emotes that are unlocked via the Cartel Market are currently only applied to the unlocking character rather than the whole account.  * Some Cartel Market items designate that they can be sold when they cannot.  * Some items on the Cartel Market may have missing or incorrect icons.  * The description for unlocking additional inventory slots currently does not inform Subscribers that they are able to unlock additional space using in game credits.  * Tooltips for equipment that requires Event Equipment Requisition Authorization do not update properly when players unlock the requirement. * Some boosts in the Cartel Market do not have complete tooltips. * There is not currently a confirmation when making Cartel Coin purchases outside of the Cartel Market   **Classes and Combat**  * Attacking pets from the opposite faction will cause abilities to have incorrect animation.  **Crew Skills**  * Once players convert to Subscriber Status, extra Crew Skills are not unlocked automatically. Players must go into the Cartel Market and select which skills to unlock. Players will not be charged for these unlocks after subscribing.  * When sending multiple companion characters on the same mission granted by a Mission Discovery, only the first mission will be successful and duplicate missions will be consumed.  **Companion Characters**  * If players give a gift to their companion but then unsummon the companion before the cast bar is complete, the gift will disappear and no affection will be granted. * Khem Val's weapon is not visible when sheathed. * Companion Lightsaber glowing may persist in some circumstances after the companion has been dismissed.  * Gault: When the ability ""Volley"" is activated manually by the player, the channel bar will only appear briefly and the ability will cancel early. When it is used by Gault automatically, the channel will work properly.  * Companion conversations will not trigger properly in the Drunkard's Vote Cantina on Coruscant.  **Group Finder**  * Players who disconnect while their group is in the Group Finder queue will not receive random rewards as intended after completing Group Finder content.  **Flashpoints and Operations**  * Operations phase entrances will not change from orange to purple for players who purchase Weekly Pass: Operations while in a group, but the pass will be in effect.  * The timer for resetting a Flashpoint phase does not reset after 5 minutes as intended.  * Flashpoint: The Foundry: Players will experience a client crash after the conversation with Helm Officer Martos. This only occurs in Hard Mode.  * Operation: Explosive Conflict: The ""Protected"" buff may remain on Ugnaugh Machinist longer than intended.  * Operation: Explosive Conflict: The reticle for the Hover Tank ability ""Charged Burst"" may incorrectly disappear after it is disspelled.  * Operation: Terror From Beyond: During the encounter with Kel'Sara, the ""Mark of Death"" ability will not be visible by players with a Graphics Quality Preset of ""Very Low"" * Operation: Terror From Beyond: Recognizer and Regulator's targeting reticles may not display properly when players are standing on the outer (blue) circle of the encounter's platform.  **Legacy**  If players are on a mission step that requires them to return to their Capital World (Dromund Kaas or Coruscant), using the Legacy ability ""Priority Transport: Capital World"" will not properly update the mission step.  Workaround: Players must return to their ship, leave the Capital World, and then return by means other than the ""Priority Transport: Capital World"" Legacy ability in order to advance the mission.  **Missions and NPCs**  **Missions**  * Section X: The Shackle Remote mission item from [DAILY] March of the Dread Guard is incorrectly displayed in the Mission Log for [DAILY] Hyperbiology and [DAILY] Targeted Misfire.  * Section X: Lost Reconnaissance: Slaying the Voracious Tuk'ata does not grant intended progress towards the mission step ""Defeat Wild Beasts."" * Section X: March of the Dread Guard: When attempting to use the Shackle Remote mission item on Trandoshan Prisoners, players are incorrectly given an error that should indicate that the item is only usable on Gammorean and Trandoshan Leaders.  * Section X: March of the Dread Guard: The mission step for ""Return to the Mission Dropbox"" does not have a mapnote.  **Class Missions**  * Trooper: Justice: Players can currently become stuck while attempting to complete the Trooper mission Justice if they fall into a section of missing floor encountered during the mission.  &gt;Workaround: Players can avoid the hole, but if they become stuck they must use a Fleet Pass or other area transition pass (like Priority Transport: Capital World) to become unstuck.  * Bounty Hunter: Honor or Glory: This mission does not have mapnotes.  * Bounty Hunter: Number One With a Bullet: The loading screen text does not update as intended. This does not affect the character's game progress, and the mission's completion is valid.  * Sith Warrior: Contact Made: When beginning the mission, it does not show up under Balmorra on the Galaxy Map.  * Sith Inquisitor: The Prophet Arrives: Players are not rewarded with proper lightside/darkside points for this mission.  * Imperial Agent: Hostile Takeover: When using the ""Droid Disguise"" to infiltrate the VerveGen Corporation, characters will become completely invisible. * Jedi Consular: Find the Ancient Weapon: This optional Class mission on Voss does not currently update as intended when players successfully loot the mission item.

t5_2qvhj,goretsky,1353054913,"Hello,  All recent Thinkpads contain a whitelist in their BIOS firmware of wireless MiniPCIe cards that work with the device.  If you install a wireless MiniPCIe card that is not whitelisted, the machine with throw up an 1801 error on power up.  If you look at the T520's [hardware maintenance manual](http://support.lenovo.com/en_US/guides-and-manuals/detail.page?LegacyDocID=MIGR-76854) in the Parts Index section, you should find a listing of recognized wireless MiniPCIe cards.  These will be listed with a FRU (field replacement unit) number:  *  Intel Centrino®Wireless-N 1000 - 60Y3241  *  ThinkPad 1x1 b/g/n Wireless LAN Mini-PCI Express Adapter II - 60Y3247 *(I'm assuming this is currently installed one)*  *  Intel Centrino Advanced-N 6205 - 60Y3253  *  Intel Centrino Advanced-N 6300 - 60Y3233  *  Intel Centrino Advanced-N + WiMAX 6250 - 60Y3195  *  Intel Centrino Advanced-N + WiMAX 6250, Russia SKU - 60Y3209  Unless you are currently using a WiMAX (a/k/a 802.16e) network, I would suggest going with the 6205/60Y3253 if you have two wireless antennas in your W520 (for a maximum speed of 300Mbps), or the 6300/60Y3233 if you have three (max. speed 450Mbps).  The HMM should provide details on how many your model contains.  At the very least, the two-antenna model will always work.  As mentioned earlier, you need to get the specific whitelisted MiniPCIe card for your W520, a ""generic OEM"" will not work.  When making your purchase, search on the FRU number and get a unit that has that.  On eBay or Amazon, the listings will usually contain the FRU number as well as mention compatibility with your model of ThinkPad.  Regards,  Aryeh Goretsky ",®

t5_2rzjk,Praxibetel_Ix,1353060015,"Not being a smart ass but can some one tell me at least one story of utopia that has compelling plot and was successfull? I would love to read one. Seems to me that any story based in a utopia would have no conflict because in the sense of the word the setting is perfect. And if the utopia  is just a guise to control  or mislead, then it falls back to the category of dystopia. Even if it is a comedy about how much it sucks to live in a perfect place void of any conflict or challenge it runs close to being dystopic again.  And those purely descriptive short stories about how advanced and perfect the future will be does not count. I.e. home of the future type shorts   P.s.Sorry for bad writing ... on phone  EDIT:  I guess when I was reading the post my mind jumped straight to the thought of a story that takes place within a stand alone utopia with no outside interactions. for example as if the earth had become a one government utopia but had yet to make contact with any other species or conflicting nations. This idea still leaves room for the interactions of the inhabitants but in a perfect world.  BUT in this perfect world who needs to interact with other people?  What would be their reason for interaction?   ""Hi bob, today is a great day.""    ""indeed it is. Did you need something Jim?""  ""No. I just was using our Telicom to speak to you from my home pod.""  ""Ah, yes don't you love our home pods? They allow us to do everything virtually.

The problems with the current situation are deeper, and far more complex, than most people like to consider.  We have the issues that pertain to these workers themselves; the dangers in getting here, the abuse they receive due to their legal status, etc.  We have the issues that pertain to the US; we cannot simply absorb every person that wants to come here, no country could and the idea of a wide open border in a world with folks that think itâ€™s ok to strap on bombs and blow themselves up in crowded placed is problematic.  We have the issues that pertain to Mexico; they want the status quo as it relieves stresses on any social services they provide there (those most likely to consume those resources are the ones who come to the US illegally) and the influx of US funds those workers send back to Mexico account for a large part of their economy.  So, I am all for making it easier for them to work here legally (simple criminal background check that does not include prior residency issues).  However, along with that I would say that *not* being here legally (after the implementation of such a system) should carry fairly harsh penalties, and employing someone who is not here legally would carry harsher penalties.  Path to citizenship is another matter that can be addressed after the larger issue of undocumented workers has been dealt with.  Though, I *do* think citizenship should require a working knowledge of the English language because, while we do not have an â€œofficialâ€ language in law, we do have a de facto one in practice.

t5_2sfmf,LeeHyori,1353100600,"It does make sense what you wrote!  I mean, in some sense, at the end of the day, it looks like we have to make some consequentialist considerations. If, for example, we concede what you say about income disparity, then I suppose we would have to talk about whether or not government (a) is in fact the best tool to reduce income disparity, and (b) whether reducing income disparity is even a good thing. Once we think about that, we have to discuss what these ""good things"" are, and what the aim of all this policy-making is. So, is it just the preference for prosperity and wealth over impoverishment and suffering and misery? These are all philosophical considerations in some form or another. (♥)  Milton Friedman rejected principled libertarianism, and a bunch of libertarian thinkers hate him for it. He described himself as a pure consequentialist libertarian, and only valued ""liberty"" insofar as it was a variable in the consequentialist calculus. But even then, we could say that he was just a utilitarian, and really just philosophizing on those grounds. So, it looks like we can never escape the philosophical paradigm, but I understand what you're saying. Seems like it's a matter of higher order vs. lower order intellection. (I wrote a paper when I was a little younger about this: ""The three layers of intellection,"" which I think you kind of touch on here... It goes 1. Policy, 2. Ideology, 3. Philosophy.) But back to the main topic.  I think what you're trying to suggest is that there really is just a pragmatic aspect to all of this, and that trying so hard to commit ourselves to some abstract theory should not be our supreme priority. I just think that this in itself is a philosophical question that can be abstracted quite easily, but it's really hard to wrap my head around it all, so I can't articulate it well for you now.   On the whole, I do know myself to be someone who really does not like *ad hoc* solutions or judgments. I'm a big stickler for consistency and coherence, and I guess what I can extrapolate from you is that sometimes, we don't have time to think about these things when real people are actually suffering.

There is indeed marginal cost in the production of music - studio time, gear, engineers, producers, etc. You could arguably go as far as including marketing and promotion.   yeah well i can watch a movie that cost millions of dollars sometimes tens of millions to produce for free on TV. You cant explain that ©. Its no longer costs millions for the TV station to broadcast it. And they cover their expenses via revenue because the better is their programme the better is their REACH. The better is the REACH the better is the revenue. Same for the artists no?  Also continuing on movies vs music line most of costs of movies are recovered in theaters not in DVD's (lol DVD's). Why shouldnt most of the costs of the music be recovered on the concerts?  THe truth is the value labels add to the music is disproportionally small to the revenue share they receive from said music. They are no longer required and thus their share is starting to approximate actual value of their services. The ""market"" correction.That is all.",©

t5_2sfmf,Quierochurros,1353123373,"The problem is the idea that *fewer* regulations equals a level playing field. The fact is that we have to make choices. Do we have anarchy or do we have laws. Ok, we choose laws. But now, who makes them?   Yes, a lot of regulations might be redundant, poorly written, our geared toward helping a particular company win a cola war or something, and I'm fine with removing or rewriting those.   But I've heard arguments about how ""unfair"" and expensive it is for a small business to have to comply with the ADA, as in ""Fuck the handicapped, that ramp costs too much."" OSHA? ""*Two* first aid kits? Kept *close to* the machinery? Tyranny!""  A lot of regulations are *good, necessary* measures that ensure there is some recourse against the 1% that controls the vast majority of wealth and power. ""Freedom"" is just a word and an idea without laws to back it up. Many slaves lived more comfortably than sharecroppers did because there was no regulation to protect the sharecroppers. Workers striking for better pay and conditions were killed for their troubles. Triangle Shirtwaist fire, anyone?

t5_2sfmf,Quierochurros,1353129416,"I'm going to respond to this with a quote, then tie it back to your initial question.  ""Corporations *are* people, my friend.""  My beef with libertarians in recent weeks is due to two things: their tendencies to lambast Obama and to play the martyr while doing so.  Now, I may be seeing a skewed sample since I just see posts that make my personal front page, but all the posts I see from libertarians seem to boil down to ""Obama is a war criminal who anally raped the Constitution and reddit is one giant circlejerk that loves him."" Invariably these posts have a huge karma score and are filled with reasonable discourse from redditors of all stripes -- with libertarian responses upvoted every bit as much as liberal ones. I think a lot of libertarian redditors have a confirmation bias regarding reddit being liberal and really tend to remember the liberal comments.  Regarding Obama -- we all want to end the ""boots-on-the-ground"", ""hot"" wars and Obama seems committed to that. All of his alleged unconstitutional acts seem to be part of the War On Terror™ and, in his eyes (and those of his advisors), helpful in the continued prosecution of that war as ""boots-on-the-ground"" involvement is reduced. Plus, many (most?) of these were already in place from the previous administration(s).  None of that is to say that I approve, but why would I make a stink before the election? I know elections are almost the only way the public can hold a President directly accountable for his actions, but why would we do it in this case?  Honestly, I think part of Obama's reasoning behind the way he has conducted the war is that it covers his ass from Republican attack. They couldn't use the old ""Democrats are pussies"" attack. And what was the GOP going to do? Attack him on civil liberties? Not when the only thing they see as liberty is low taxes.  And, sure enough, who did they nominate? Mitt ""Corporations Are People"" Romney. Did he every give any indication that he would do anything to cease those policies? No, and given the hawkish talk regarding Iran (and Russia!) those pouches would have been expanded in all likelihood.  Why does reddit seem anti-libertarian? I think largely because libertarians have, of late, been repeatedly criticizing Obama during an election for policies which his only real competition would likely only expand upon. And that's not even mentioning all the other things that may have occurred in a Romney administration. Corporate persohood, embryonic personhood, the ACA and Dream Act -- Romney's policies on these were enough to make us overlook what we don't like about Obama. Now that the election is over I won't be surprised to see more criticism here. That is, if Republicans in DC aren't completely batshit crazy. If they're attacking him non-stop and obstruction is the order of the day (as in first term) I imagine liberals won't be too critical because they still support many of his goals.",™

t5_2qore,exaltedgod,1353150754,"Yes and no. And I know some are not going to agree with this, but then again... this is contracting law. While you (MajorMajor) are sort of correct with the contracting agreement, you are not right on who and what the parties are in this case. So, let me clear some things up (respectfully of course =) ).  This here states the first ""party"" (Diablo 3) which in all legality is the game client itself (thus Blizzard as they own the rights to it) because it is the game client that is a ""software"" to your computer (i.e Party 1):  &gt;**The Diablo® III software program, and all files that are delivered to you by Blizzard Entertainment, Inc. (via on-line transmission or otherwise) to ""patch,"" update, or otherwise modify the software program, as well as all printed materials and electronic documentation (the ""Manual""), together with any and all copies and derivative works of such software program and Manual (collectively, the ""Game"") is the copyrighted work of Blizzard Entertainment, Inc. or its licensors (collectively, ""Blizzard"").**   &gt;Any and all uses of the Game are governed by the terms of this End User License Agreement (the ""License Agreement"" or ""Agreement"").  The second party is the end user BUT before the end user even gets a chance to get access to the paid service, they have to agree to be Party 2.  &gt;Before playing the Game, you must: (i) obtain an authorization code from a ‘box’ copy of the Game or through the Service; and (ii) **register for and log in using an authorized account with the Service (the ""Account""). The Game is distributed solely for use by authorized end users according to the terms of this License Agreement.** Any use, reproduction, modification or distribution of the Game not expressly authorized by the terms of this License Agreement is expressly prohibited.  **HOWEVER** Because Blizzard cannot see the difference between one user on a computer that logs in via a profile and another (for example me and my brother), the ""technical"" end user still has to be identified. For those that try to argue, ""Well you agreed to the ToS upon installation thus you are the end user,"" not technically as I could use an account and my brother could use the same account and unless he is there and agrees in a written and notarized way, there is no other way to be absolute that he agreed to the ToS. So, the only way to perform this is via the account log in. So, Party 2 is technically the account in which a person(s) signs up for before playing the game (it is referred to as the ""Account"" in the ToS). Being that this account is not hard coded into the chips on the motherboard of the computer and the fact the ""user"" has to use a browser to get to an account outside of the client itself makes this ""Account"" a software. (i.e. Party 2 -second software).  Now that we have Party 1 and 2, we can establish any any third parties that may or not not be authorized via the contract. Blizzard has said **""any unauthorized third-party software""**. Whether this is Loot Alert and I change the code by a letter to make it mine, whether I write a script to scrape the RAM to get information and have it displayed elsewhere. This is all a third party. Blue posts have said countless times (stuck behind a firewall at work and cannot reach the battle.net site for proof) if you have to use another tool other than the game and you, it is a third party, why risk it? But lets say I happen to be wrong, I am only human you know. So does this keyboard need a software other than the script that is written to display the information on it? More than likely yes. So there, that's another party outside of the agreement.  &gt;Official Blizzard Quote (Source) We've recently issued several rounds of account bans for cheating in Diablo III. In each of these cases players used a hack program for exploitive purposes, for example to zoom out their game view and kill monsters that were beyond the normal range at which AI is triggered. As we do with all Blizzard games, we will continue to monitor Diablo III for cheating and take action as needed. As a reminder, we don't permit the use of hacks or other third-party software in conjunction with Diablo III. Most of the programs out there that are intended for use with the game are actually cheat programs and automation programs (""bots"") that exploit Diablo III's mechanics and provide players with an unfair advantage. However, ""third-party software"" also refers to any file or program that attempts to:  * Obtain information about Diablo III that's not normally available to the player   * Transmit or modify the Diablo III game files   * **Provide access to features or abilities beyond what is allowed by the game's design**   * Change how Diablo III interacts with Battle.net In addition to undermining the spirit of fair play, this type of software can cause nasty technical problems, game-related bugs, and stability and performance issues with Battle.net. All of which can put a demon-sized damper on your gaming experience. As we've said in the past, playing Diablo III legitimately means playing with an unaltered game client. We strongly recommend that you avoid using anythird-party software which interacts with Diablo III—even if you are accessing that software from a reputable third-party site—as doing so can result in permanent ban from the game. For more information on all of this, you can check out a copy of the related policy for Diablo III over on our Customer Support site.  So just to make sure everyone is on the same page.. the third bullet:  &gt;**Provide access to features or abilities beyond what is allowed by the game design.**  Being that the game does not make this users keyboard perform the desired function normally, it violates this statue. I apologize if I came across as rude or snobby, that was not my intention.  edit: Found a cached version via my SSL proxy (in other words the links might not work).spelling and grammar.

Only thing missing for some is Photoshop and Adobe Suite, though Gimp is more than enough for most people.  We use it in a professional environment at work for web graphic design and it does the job fine.  As for iTunes... well, fuck that shit.  I can see from other comments that Android has been mentioned, and I can see your reservations...  My advice is to get an Android handset and never look back.  I've done iOS and Android, and there really is no contest now.  It used to be that Android lagged far behind as far as hardware went.  Now, Android shits all over even the latest iOS devices.  The OS is far better, with way more killer apps (SSH, etc).  Rooting my SGSII and putting on CyanogenMod increased the battery life dramitically (getting rid of all the bloatware).  With the bloatware it was quite frustrating, and I can understand some people not getting a good experience from a telcom provided handset out of the box, but once you pluck up the courage to install Android as it was meant to be, then you really do get a far better experience.",☑

We solved this problem by eliminating tillage,” says Almir Rebelo, grower advisor and president of Friends of the Earth, a Brazilian grower organization influential in the adoption of no-till farming in Brazil.  &gt;With conservation tillage, farmers leave the stubble or plant residue on the soil’s surface, rather than plowing or disking it into the soil.  The new crop is planted directly into this stubble, and genetically modified (GM) herbicide-tolerant plants make it possible and practical for growers to control weeds in the crop by applying an herbicide rather than plowing.    http://dmedia.ucsc.edu/~bsharris/film%20170a/proj3/monsanto/biotech-gmo/asp/topic5392.html?id=ConservationTillage  &gt;Roundup Ready® Crops Have Major Positive Impact on  Tillage Practices*  &gt;The benefits of conservation tillage systems in crop production including reduced  tillage and no-till are well documented. Reduced soil erosion, reduced labor and  fuel costs and conserving valuable soil moisture in drier climates are among the  many benefits experienced when growers shift from conventional tillage to  reduced tillage and no-till. University weed scientist have additional information  to show corn, soybean and cotton growers adopting Roundup Ready cropping  systems increase the use of conservation tillage practices.  Nearly 1200 growers in six states (approximately 200 per state) were surveyed by  telephone in the winter of  2005-2006.  A large  percentage of growers  transitioned from  conventional tillage to  conservation tillage  including no-till and  reduced tillage systems  after adopting Roundup  Ready crops in their crop  rotation (Figure 1).  http://btny.purdue.edu/weedscience/2009/GlyTillage09.pdf  &gt;In a study published in 1993, researchers at the University of Kentucky found that no-till methods decreased soil erosion by a whopping 98 percent. More recently, investigators at the University of Tennessee reported that no-till tobacco farming reduced soil erosion by more than 90 percent over conventional tobacco cultivation.   http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=a-case-for-no-till-farmin  &gt;“We had some erosion, but not nearly to the extent of conventionally-tilled farms,” said Caviness. “Due to the residue on the soil surface, raindrops absorb better and don’t have the explosive impact on the soil. The subsurface of the soil is also protected by the dead roots that hold everything together.”  &gt;Bednarek said that soil infiltration test results from Caviness’ farm indicate findings consistent with other no-till operations.  http://www.ia.nrcs.usda.gov/news/successstories/Caviness.html   Herbicide resistant crops make no-till a much more practical option and have resulted in a significant increase in no-till farming and reduction in conventional tilling since their release.",®

t5_2qlqh,3825,1353247002,"When the iTunes store began offering apps that used cellphone light to cure acne, federal investigators knew that hucksters had found a new spot in cyberspace.  “We realized this could be a medium for mischief,” said James Prunty, a Federal Trade Commission attorney who helped pursue the government’s only cases against health-app developers last year, shutting down two acne apps.  Since then, the Food and Drug Administration has been mired in a debate over how to oversee these high-tech products, and government officials have not pursued any other app developers for making medically dubious claims. Now, both the iTunes store and the Google Play store are riddled with health apps that experts say do not work and in some cases could even endanger people.  These apps offer quick fixes for everything from flabby abs to alcoholism, and they promise relief from pain, stress, stuttering and even ringing in the ears. Many of these apps do not follow established medical guidelines, and few have been tested through the sort of clinical research that is standard for less new-fangled treatments sold by other means, a probe by the New England Center for Investigative Reporting has found.  While some are free, thousands must be purchased, at prices ranging from 69 cents to $999. Nearly 247 million mobile phone users around the world are expected to download a health app in 2012, according to Research2Guidance, a global market research firm.  In an examination of 1,500 health apps that cost money and have been available since June 2011, the center found that more than one out of five claims to treat or cure medical problems. Of the 331 therapeutic apps, nearly 43 percent relied on cellphone sound for treatments. Another dozen used the light of the cellphone, and two others used phone vibrations. Scientists say none of these methods could possibly work for the conditions in question.  ‘Bogus’ claims  “Virtually any app that claims it will cure someone of a disease, condition or mental health condition is bogus,” says John Grohol, an expert in online health technology, pointing out that the vast majority of apps have not been scientifically tested. “Developers are just preying on people’s vulnerabilities.”  Satish Misra, a physician and the managing editor of the app review Web site iMedicalApps, adds: “They take some therapeutic method that is real — and in some cases experimental — and create a grossly simplified version of that therapy using the iPhone. Who knows? Maybe it works.” But until testing shows otherwise, “my feeling would be that it doesn’t.”  To be sure, there are many outstanding health apps, particularly those intended for doctors and hospitals, that are helping to revolutionize medical care, according to physicians and others. Among the most well-regarded apps for consumers: Lose It for weight loss, Azumio to measure heart rates, and iTriage to check symptoms and locate hospitals with the shortest emergency room wait times.  But consumers have almost no way of distinguishing great high-tech tools from what Prunty called the “snake oil.” Without government oversight or independent testing of apps, people mainly must rely on developers’ advertisements and anonymous online reviews, many of which are positive but some, such as this one, are not: “Shame on Apple for even allowing this piece of crap on here. . . . It preys on people with health issues.”  When contacted, Apple declined to discuss its apps or its app development process. The company’s lengthy guidelines for app developers say it will reject apps that crash, have bugs, do not perform as advertised or are sexually explicit. A Google spokeswoman also declined to discuss its apps or rules for developers. The company’s content guidelines say it bans sexually explicit material, gratuitous violence or anything that may damage users’ devices.  The FDA is drafting regulations that outline which types of health apps would need government approval before they can be marketed. But the regulations have been bogged down by debates, hearings and legislative back-and-forth over whether government oversight would stifle innovation. “Applying a complex regulatory framework could inhibit future growth and innovation in this promising market,” six Republican members of Congress wrote last spring to the heads of the FDA and Federal Communications Commission, reflecting some of the concern.  A few private groups, meanwhile, are working to assess the quality of various apps. Misra’s iMedicalApps gets health-care professionals to review software applications that mainly interest physicians. Happtique, a subsidiary of the Greater New York Hospital Association, is about to launch the nation’s first app certification service, which will evaluate apps for safety and effectiveness. It will award some apps the high-tech equivalent of the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval.  Smartphone stress test  Misra, an internal medicine resident at Johns Hopkins Hospital, says he’s most concerned about apps that claim to test or treat consumers for serious diseases. These apps can sometimes give inaccurate information or lull people into ignoring symptoms that might need medical attention.  Cardiac Stress Test, for instance, says on Google Play (where it sells for $3.07) that it can determine “if you are ready for sports or if your heart is not in a healthy condition.” A person performs 30 squats in less than a minute and then enters his heart rate into the app’s calculator, which reports whether the user is in shape for exercise.  “It’s hard not to imagine how this app could give folks a false sense of security,” Misra says, noting that assessing someone’s cardiac status is not just a matter of looking at his heart rate.  Simon Bertrand, who developed the app for his own use, said it is designed to help healthy people monitor their heart, similar to apps that monitor weight or body mass. “If you are in poor health condition,” he said in an e-mail, “go to see a doctor.”  Later, in an interview by phone from France, Bertrand said his app was available for sale on Google Play within minutes of his submitting it to the company. “It’s just a test. It’s not an application that claims to cure.”  Cellphone light as therapy  Apps that rely on cellphone light cannot possibly have any therapeutic value, experts say. While light treatments can be used to relieve some medical problems, cellphone light is in the wrong spectrum and far too weak to make any impact at all, said the FTC’s Prunty.  “Using the light of the cellphone is automatically suspect,” Prunty said, which is why the agency decided last year to file complaints against two developers who claimed cellphone light could cure acne.  The FTC argued in its complaints that the developers’ claims were “false or misleading.” AcneApp, which sold for $1.99 on iTunes, claimed that blue light fought bacteria and red light helped heal skin. “Rest the iPhone against your skin’s acne-prone areas for two minutes daily to improve skin health without prescription drugs,” it said. The app was downloaded 11,600 times, according to the FTC complaint.  A similar app for Android phones, Acne Pwner, was downloaded 3,300 times, the FTC said.  [...]  © The Washington Post Company",©

t5_2cneq,half_cocked,1353255066,"Nice. Great source of information from the Union that caused the company closure. I give you this, from Hostess:  ""Hostess Brands Inc. today announced that it is winding down operations and has filed a motion with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court seeking permission to close its business and sell its assets, including its iconic brands and facilities. Bakery operations have been suspended at all plants. Delivery of products will continue and Hostess Brands retail stores will remain open for several days in order to sell already-baked products.""  ""The Board of Directors authorized the wind down of Hostess Brands to preserve and maximize the value of the estate after one of the Company’s largest unions, the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers International Union (BCTGM), initiated a nationwide strike that crippled the Company’s ability to produce and deliver products at multiple facilities.""  ""On Nov. 12, Hostess Brands permanently closed three plants as a result of the work stoppage. On Nov. 14, the Company announced it would be forced to liquidate if sufficient employees did not return to work to restore normal operations by 5 p.m., EST p.m., Nov. 15. The Company determined on the night of Nov. 15 that an insufficient number of employees had returned to work to enable the restoration of normal operations.""  ""The BCTGM in September rejected a last, best and final offer from Hostess Brands designed to lower costs so that the Company could attract new financing and emerge from Chapter 11. Hostess Brands then received Court authority on Oct. 3 to unilaterally impose changes to the BCTGM’s collective bargaining agreements.""  ""Hostess Brands is unprofitable under its current cost structure, much of which is determined by union wages and pension costs. The offer to the BCTGM included wage, benefit and work rule concessions but also gave Hostess Brands’ 12 unions a 25 percent ownership stake in the company, representation on its Board of Directors and $100 million in reorganized Hostess Brands’ debt.""  “We deeply regret the necessity of today’s decision, but we do not have the financial resources to weather an extended nationwide strike,” said Gregory F. Rayburn, chief executive officer. “Hostess Brands will move promptly to lay off most of its 18,500-member workforce and focus on selling its assets to the highest bidders.”  ""In addition to dozens of baking and distribution facilities around the country, Hostess Brands will sell its popular brands, including Hostess®, Drakes® and Dolly Madison®, which make iconic cake products such as Twinkies®, CupCakes, Ding Dongs®, Ho Ho’s®, Sno Balls® and Donettes®. Bread brands to be sold include Wonder®, Nature’s Pride ®, Merita®, Home Pride®, Butternut®, and Beefsteak®, among others.""  ""The wind down means the closure of 33 bakeries, 565 distribution centers, approximately 5,500 delivery routes and 570 bakery outlet stores throughout the United States.""  ""The Company said its debtor-in-possession lenders have agreed to allow the Company to continue to have access to the $75 million financing facility put in place at the start of the bankruptcy cases to fund the sale and wind down process, subject to U.S. Bankruptcy Court approval.""  ""The Company’s motion asks the Court for authority to continue to pay employees whose services are required during the wind-down period.""  ""For employees whose jobs will be eliminated, additional information can be found at hostessbrands.info . The website also contains information for customers and vendors. Most employees who lose their jobs should be eligible for government-provided unemployment benefits.""  See, I can get my biased sources just as easily as you can. Listen, liberal. Just because you can copy and paste just like any other user on Reddit doesn't make you a scholar and expert in business and how it works.   The only fact that stands out and cannot be refuted is that if the striking employees returned to work on the day they were told to, they would still have jobs. It is a simple as that. They didn't and now we taxpayers have to foot the bill when 18,000+ workers sign up for unemployment benefits (which, by the way, we will have to pay for since the employer is no longer in business) and food stamps. So, congratulations, liberal. You won once again. 18,000+ new welfare cases for your ever expanding government hand-outs. Shit, what's the big deal in adding almost 18,000 new people to the food stamp programs already unsustainable 47,000,000 beneficiaries. Way to go.  But then again, what an I bitching about?

There are four things Protoss can do off of two bases, besides getting a third.  Immortal-Sentry all in: Abduct solves a lot of this issue, without actually adding power to the Zerg army like the Infestor does. Vipers *feel* like weaker Infestors. They don't root. They allow for micro. They don't have any way of physically *harming* another unit.  Blink all-in: Blinding cloud the stalkers, force them to blink, blinding cloud them again and surround. Seems easy enough to warrant testing. Again, this puts micro in the hands of *both* the Zerg **and** the Protoss. Currently, until the late-game, Protoss is the only race with the *chance* to micro. ( Morrow summed up how Zergs feel in an article on this. )  Stargate: This is the most interesting to me as the Viper will actually make you *want* to make Hydralisks. It makes it so that the tech switch to Colossus from the Protoss isn't insta-death on the Zerg's part. This will, by far, be the most interesting aspect of this change.  Two Base Timing with Colossus: Again, something that becomes hold-able with Vipers. This actually makes it so that a Roach/Hydra Composition stands *a chance* versus Colossus. Both Zergs *and* the Protoss would be microing, instead of what currently happens---Zerg A-Clicks, grabs their Infestors, then tries to Micro those and leaves it up to the Protoss to worry about the rest. If Protoss lands the perfect forcefields, Zerg's dead. If Protoss miss-micros, they're dead.  Zealot Pressure on your Third ( I don't count this, so it's not part of my initial list.

Sometimes it comes from a pylon, at which point if you make Roaches---You hold easily off of three bases.    The Viper makes it so that Zerg micros, but it's abilities aren't as powerful as the Infestor. En-Masse, Infestors are always good. They give you free units and do damage. En-Masse, Vipers are considerably weaker. If you have no army to support them, I don't care *how many abduct's you land*: my units are just going to fight you from the inside out now. ",♥

t5_2cneq,highguy420,1353263545,"As a self-proclaimed ""vehemently pro-union"" person, and apparently someone who possesses the ability to clearly articulate yourself on the subject, I'd greatly appreciate your feedback on a topic I have been trying to fully grasp.  Recently I realized that, while I don't think anyone should ever be prevented from, or forced to join a union by law, unions are actually an ineffective stop-gap. An improper solution to the problem that distracts from the actual problem.  I base my new opinion on the simple fact that the unions cannot ultimately do the single thing they have promised their members. They do not own the company that provides the work, and therefore they cannot guarantee access to work. At any time, if the board of directors thinks they can make more money moving production to another country without unions, they can do that and the unions have no ability to stop it.   This realization actually opened up an entirely new perspective on corporate governance. I realized that the traditional corporate model is inherently flawed. It is simply unsustainable. Sure, in some cases you can have an altruistic CEO that values the company as their personal possession and sees money going to the company and workers as an investment in their own company, but that is rare in the modern day and age. Most of those types of companies are small and employ far too few people for unions to be a concern (Little Debbie may be one of those rare large exceptions). But for the most part we can clearly see a myriad of examples of corporate greed setting the overall tone for the industry.   The problem, as I see it, comes from the inherent conflict of interest in the board room. The board members are forced to decide if they want less profit or more profit at the expense of the workers. The only way to erase that conflict of interest is to conflate the concept of the worker and the board member. When every worker is a member of the board there is no conflict of interest.   When discussing this, many people have brought up the fact that you could lose control of the company, but nobody ""controls"" the company, so how could you lose something you don't have? Once the company is transferred to the workers the only outcome can be what the workers voted for. They can then decide if they want a larger paycheck, which is taxed and partially withheld for various state and federal programs, or they can choose to have a larger dividend check when the corporation pays out annually, taxed at corporate gains rates.   In the traditional ""I put the money in, I should get a return on my investment"" sense there are other business models that may work better for that. This is not something an investor would choose for themselves. This is something the workers either choose to create from the ground up to ensure a job for themselves and their coworkers, or something the workers choose for themselves in response to a corporate shutdown.   This also means that these companies are much more resilient. Sure, the workers could all decide that they would rather not work and only make a small paycheck each by hiring people in China to do the work for them, but without that profit being concentrated into the hands of a few people it's not generally large enough of an amount to be worth considering. The workers will choose to keep their high-paying job in a rewarding workplace. A handful of people can't shut the plant down against the wishes of the workers.   Now, unions have played various roles in history, however in the recent past they have been used by the corporations to pacify the workers while they gut our country of its wealth. That sounds hyperbolic, so let me clarify a bit. By wealth I mean our ability to produce. The factories that have been moved to China, Mexico, South America, India, Africa and other places with cheaper labor are our ability to produce more than we consume as a nation. Without the ability to produce goods and trade with the world we will go broke. Anyone with a checking account knows we can't spend more than we make for very long. That's what I mean by the wealth of our nation. I'm not talking about currency itself, but the ability to provide for ourselves as a country.   Furthermore, the unions were effective. Too effective. In the '70s we had the highest wages, highest per-capita income, and lowest corporate profit percentage in our recent history. The workers had demanded their fair share, and they were sharing in the wealth these companies were producing. The shareholders saw this as a problem, because they have traditionally been able to divert much more of the profits away from the workers into their own accounts. The only way to rectify this was to move the factories to countries where unionization and worker rights didn't exist. But to do so suddenly and drastically would leave the blame solely on their shoulders.  The unions played a crucial role in helping the companies slowly move their production overseas. By giving the workers the ability to slowly negotiate themselves out of a job they were able to point the blame at the unions themselves. They would shut down factories they already planned to shut down quietly, instead they would do it with much fanfare and the blame attributed to union actions (e.g. Hostess^® had planned to shutter factories months ago long before they could blame the strike). And their arguments were plausible. And people believed them, because they wanted an enemy, an antagonist in the story. Those greedy unions destroyed the company. Well, it was greed, but union greed is only a very small part of it. For the one finger the board members point at the union there are three pointing back at them from the same hand.  There were other factors as well, especially as the problem worsened. Walmart^® fits in later on in the game by gaining enough control of the market demand that they could help put pressure on the smaller companies who refused to offshore, convincing them to either move production to cheaper markets or liquidate their brand and assets to others who would do so (Huffy^® and Rubbermaid^® as two prominent examples). There are documentaries that cover this so I won't get into too much detail, but I will briefly explain that they were such a large customer for any brand that their production demand alone forced many companies to borrow money and build new infrastructure to service Walmart^® alone, then they would make threats to pull the products from their shelves, causing the company to either reduce the price they are charging Walmart^® (sometimes below their own cost of production) or walk away from their brand and/or principles. They used their control of market demand to force companies to move production offshore.   Instead of solving the problem, the unions were co-opted into being complicit in the slow and ultimate gutting of our production infrastructure. And they even took the blame for it too. For promising us access to work and a living wage they sure did gravely miss the mark. I'd characterize their performance as ""distracting us from the real problem while vying for increased control over the workers"". That sounds much like the same goals of the corporations. Maybe the lesson to learn is that concentrating power seems to cause an opportunity for corruption. Whether we are concentrating the productive output of hundreds or thousands (or millions) of workers in the hands of a few board members or concentrating the human productivity of hundreds or thousands (or millions) of workers in the hands of a few union representatives.  To reduce the concept to simplest terms we are fighting the exploitative concentration of power with another system that concentrates our collective power. Great, now we have not one but two bureaucracies vying for a slice of our productive output. The board must make a profit, and the union dues must be paid. And then we get some of what's left, hopefully. That or they outsource our jobs to countries with one less leech sucking from the profit stream. Why not remove both leeches and keep high-paying jobs in the country?  I have recently come to the conclusion that those who wish to actually protect their jobs must begin the process of buying the companies they work for. Buying the company from the board of directors, especially when they are already considering selling it off, can take a company that is profitable, but not profitable enough for the investors to keep it, into a company that thrives and provides jobs for hundreds or thousands of people. Sure, those investors put money and effort into starting the company, and they made their money back, now that it's ""only"" providing jobs for the workers the investors don't want to put time and effort into the company any longer, but the workers still have an incentive to maintain the company. In many cases the workers will also be in a better position to understand changing market factors and the best direction to take the company better than a board made up of investors whose only interest is making a profit from this, and all their other companies they sit on the board of.  Having had this profound realization as to the nature and inner workings of the modern corporate model I am compelled to find others to discuss it with. Even those who I consider open-minded and intelligent about the subject have strong reservations against it, arguing against logic and reason for the existing corporate model. The idea seems so foreign that ""there must be something wrong with it"". The way you describe things and the point you made about privately-owned corporations makes me think you are someone willing to consider this and capable of providing worthwhile and well-reasoned feedback.  As an interesting note, the only union I have found that aids in this process is the IWW. I have no opinion or experience with them, but I'm interested in your opinion on them as well.",®

t5_2qh1i,dtmeadows,1353266047,"I was in Rome for 2 weeks in January studying and it took me a few days to figure out the food situation. Here's a couple rules I came up with:  1. If the menu outside the door advertises for Americans, hell if it's in English, No.  2. If there's even a menu/ad outside the door, that's a risk...  3. If it's located near the big spots, Il Coliseo, The Pantheon, Spanish steps, etc. you're gonna have a hard time finding good food. It was extremely rare to find any good spots within a few blocks of these places. However, once you started to get away from there into the less popular areas, the food quality, uniqueness, authenticity got so much better. Example: The Jewish Area. Holy shitbiscuits, that food was some of the best in Italy.  4. Do not be afraid to ask the waiter what to get. This applies for anywhere on this planet pretty much. They work there, they eat the food, they've watched people order for a while... they know what you should get.  5. If the staff doesn't speak any English (which was quite rare... in fact in three weeks of being in Italy, I only clearly remember two such interactions. One was with a guy I asked for directions in Rome and he spoke Spanish so we were in the clear. The other was with the grandfather of a farm we stayed on in Tuscany... and the magic of communicating with him as he drove us to the train station was... I digress.) So, if the staff doesn't speak English, don't be afraid. Use your intuition, find something with the right words and go for it(You can always just stick with Cacciatore, Carbonara, and if you're at a good restaurant after following the previous steps, and get a glass of the house wine with it, I don't think you're gonna go too wrong).   So yeah, I was annoyed with Rome for the first few days, cause my classmates wanted to follow the signs or just use their Rome™ books... then I said fuck it and started doing stuff more on my own, stumbling upon the rules above. By the end of the trip, I ended up loving Rome more than Florence, Siena, Montepulciano... as you can tell by me writing so much on a simple comment... ",™

t5_2sbzt,MendaxRelator,1353277004,*Pastelodan* is a well known creature of the Cestian planes. Fierce hunter by nature this creature has been around for at least 73 million years. Fossil records indicate rapid change in scull structure some 55 million years ago. Before that evidence indicate this was once an omnivore. Today its diet consist mainly of meat.   It is the fastest known land hunter. It can't run very long but it achieves mind boggling speeds at short bursts of time. Strong back legs and long tick tail enables the creature great maneuverability and once it goes hunting no creature stands a chance. Movement can be described more as hopping then running. Hunting success rate is well over 70% which is extremely high.   Pastelodan does not chew its food. It rips the meat with his powerful jaws and strong teeth and swallows it in chunks. Its long tusks on the side however are not used for eating. They are used for display of power when mating season comes. Female tusks are much smaller.  Although it appears creature is hearless it is covered in very short but though fur. Fur serves little purpose because its environment is hot throughout the whole cycle. It is very adapt to hot weather so no additional insulator is required.  *This short introduction to species was brought to you by Pharmacuticon ^223™*   *More detailed information can be found in the virtual library of Aneandria.*,™

Avro Lancaster B Mark I, NG128 'SR-B', of No. 101 Squadron RAF, piloted by Warrant Officer R B Tibbs, releases bundles of 'Window' over the target during a special daylight raid on Duisburg. Over 2,000 sorties were dispatched to the city during 14-15 October 1944, in order to to demonstrate Bomber Command's overwhelming superiority in German skies. Note the large aerials on top of the Lancaster's fuselage, indicating that the aricraft is carrying 'Airborne Cigar' (ABC), a jamming device which disrupted enemy radio telephone channels.  WINDOW was the code name for small metallised strips, like tin foil, designed to be dropped in bundles from RAF bombers. The result was a gently drifting cloud of metallic strips that created confusing signals on German radar screens and concealed the position of the actual bombers.   The British government had delayed the use of the top secret WINDOW. The fear was that as soon as the RAF used it, the Germans would find the metallised strips on the ground and take up the idea - using it on raids against Britain and disabling Britain’s own vital early warning radar. The British didn’t know that the Germans had already thought of the idea of WINDOW anyway - but had not used it for exactly the same reasons as the British.

t5_2qh13,cynoclast,1353338456,"There are things which are Good™ which take lots of time, energy and talent investment. That is, they are costly and produce no profit. They are a money-sink. Say there's a cancer drug (not necessarily this one) that for a variety of reasons simply is not profitable to produce. Immensely costly, rarely prescribed, and the people who need it are mostly poor (since most people are poor).  You have a situation that only altruism and being good people can solve. That is, giving the effort or money away, effectively. Why would the free market provide this thing? Simply put, it wouldn't. Why would it? No chance of profit. Most healthcare actually falls into this category. Which is why it appalls me that we still have for-profit health-insurance. It is barbaric. But I digress...  This is one of those instances where the people, knowing it is the right thing decide to do it. So they create this thing called a government to represent their interests, and staff it with people, and everyone fund it collectively (since it is agreed to be a good thing) via taxes on themselves. A pool of money is made available, and the burden is shared since everyone agrees it is good. And viola, society provides a good thing to itself. Something a free market would simply never have a reason to provide.  You could argue that the demand for the drug would allow for it, but what if the people who need it are mostly too poor as most people are? Do only the rich people who need it get it because the costs are so high? Well, in a free market, yes. So the poor people who need it can't afford it and die for its lack.  The free market is good for a lot of things, but healthcare is not one of them.",™

t5_2qpp6,Kronen,1353339647,"Lol dude, I aint mad.  Truth is truth.  I'm watching some Netflix and chilling.  No cookies this early in the morning though.   ""They are improving, but there are none that are at ""TV-quality"" acceptable levels.""  Very true.  None of these organizations, with the possible exception Dreamhack have raised their production level to television grade production.  With your pro-player track record, I would have though you'd be more understanding of falling short of expectations.  But you're correct hold them to a high standard.  If you're going to criticize, perhaps offer constructive criticisms?  ""How about the problems with MLG and IPL and LSC etc""  First problem with that statement is that you're putting LSC on the same level as the other two organizations.  The texas brothers shoudl be incredibly chuffed that their production was even close to those larger organizations.  Secondly, what are you complaining about when it comes to IPL?  What major tournament foibles have they committed?  MLG, hell yes.  Problems galore.    ""lol wut? I'm not drama-mongering anything, just expressing a disappointment that the same people who are complaining about over-saturation hurting their tournaments aren't producing tournaments that ""rise above"" the rest of the crowd.""  You're drama-mongering because nothing you've offered here has any redeeming value nor any notes of constructive criticisms.  And you add at the end a ""back to r/lol etc ♥"", the very definition of trolling and drama-mongering.  How is that hard to understand?  Have a nice day!  ",♥

t5_2qj8f,Cornelioid,1353346997,"&gt; Debunk this.  I couldn't resist anyway.  &gt; You, not much different than 99.99% of the rest of humanity living today and who have lived so far, are idiots.  Tu quoque.  &gt; When someone comes along and starts an actual discussion about the possibilities of Tesla's work, it's being downvoted to oblivion, not because I'm an idiot, not because I'm offending someone, not because I'm off topic, but simply because this is the Right Thing To Do™ in /r/skeptic/.  You fail to mention the several responses you got. Of the direct responses, a couple trashed the ideas and claims you put forth but not one insulted you personally, and others opened the door for you to present arguments and evidence. That many members of /r/skeptic violate reddiquette is grounds for complaint at some level, i suppose, but it hardly says anything about the quality of their skepticism.  &gt; I've been a member of this community for about 3 years now, and the main thing I noticed here is that you like saying ""Oh! hey look at these retards! they think the moon is made of cheese"", and get a bunch of upvotes.  I call confirmation bias, and this would be easy to test. Pull a (clustered) random sample of posts and comments, weighted by votes, perhaps, and see how much of the dialogue this kind of derision actually constitutes. (As a small case study, consider the reactions to your own comment in the aforecited thread.)  Ditto next two paragraphs.  &gt; This is no longer a community - it's a public brothel filled with cheap whores, and most of the 57k listen on the sidebar, are well, the customers who simply enjoy coming in, doing a quicky, and going out.  Ad hominems of the slut- and sex worker–shaming variety, which as such are particularly repugnant.  Here's a suggestion: Cite some actual examples of the problems you refer to—i don't at all doubt that they do occur—and write up a post explaining why they trouble you (being careful not to assume that your own experiences are everyone's), ask what others in the subreddit think, and see what comes out of the discussion.

Because you got a package confiscated before doesn't give them probably cause to open every single piece of mail you get.   That's like saying, since you got pulled over for marijuana before, now every time you get pulled over the police have the right to search your car.  They will have to get a search warrant for every single piece of mail to be opened. A search warrant gives them the right to open the package for the search warrant they requested. Not to open every piece of mail.",®

t5_2qhk3,electriophile,1353349708,"&gt;and entertainment?  Who said anything about entertainment?  I certainly didn't and I didn't see anyone else mentioning that either.  All anyone would get is extremely basic food, shelter, and healthcare, but if they ever want modern comforts, cars, nice houses/furniture, or just to do anything other than stare at a wall for 24 hours per day, they'll have to work.  Such provisions would be highly dependent on regular drug testing, of course.  You also seem to be under the impression that the only people who use federal aid are those who don't want to work and just leach off of the system.  There are *plenty* of people who work hard and have jobs, but still don't have enough to make ends meet.  $7.25/hr will **not** pay for food, housing, clothing, education, healthcare, and utilities.  It just isn't possible, especially if more than one person needs to be supported on such an income.  And don't give me that ""they should have worked harder so it's their own fault they're poor.""  It doesn't matter if every person in the country does everything right and works their ass off; there will *always* be people at the bottom.  It's simple math.    &gt;That's akin to saying ""because magic.""  It's no more magical than the Libertarian argument that a completely unregulated free market will somehow put employers and employees on the same level, and using private for-profit companies to take over virtually all government functions would somehow increase everyone's standard of living and happiness.

Rest day on Friday or sometimes I play an extra day of Volleyball. I eat around 2200-2700 calories a day, my weight has stayed 170-180, but spiked to 185 after a weekend with some drinking (I usually avoid drinking) Back down to 180 this morning (Yes I know water weight changes a lot)   My Goal is to being able to play sand volleyball and feel comfortable in my own skin there, AKA Look awesome. I'm not following a set routine because I felt most routines would interfere with my volleyball playing schedule. What I mean is that I do have a routine, something that I put together and was working for me, but I stopped when my Real Life caught up to me and I took a break for about 2 months and after about 3-4 weeks, I'm back to where I was.

I am a redditor as well, and you're spontaneous admiration for the Best Buy Monster Cable's® has inspired me to share my admiration for them as well.    As an electronics wizard, I know a thing or two about technology, and after purchasing a High Definition Television set I knew I needed the best possible HDMI cable to ensure movie theater quality at an affordable price. I knew there was no other option than to purchase the Best Buy Monster Cable®. Plated in 21K Gold and coated with a reinforced layer of crystallized diamonds, you can bet your ass the cable won't suffer from nickonium ionization, the most common cause of loss in picture quality in HDTV sets across the country. Now, even an electronics wizard like myself isn't qualified to set up the cable for the best possible picture quality, so I made sure to purchase the GeekSquad® technical support as well. They ensured a professional setup and arrived within 3 weeks. I also purchased the 3 year service plan, because even gold plated cables are still susceptible to witchcraft and other supernatural causes. All of this at the low price of $12,000 (purchase price does not include state taxes). Compare that to the $420,000 required for opening a theater and you can clearly see how great the value is. I love my Best Buy Monster Cables®, and you will too.",®

He generally keeps to himself and doesn't bother anything as long as I leave the TV on, and have a constant supply of room temperature chili dogs.  Fees are $20/month.  As far as nitrates go, I have recently gotten him to start relieving himself in the guest bathroom.  It was a challenge, but after losing hundreds in coral due to the complications that transpired after his ""shit bath"" technique proved ineffective, we got it down.   He is a 1939 model.  It's dated, I know, but they just don't make them like they used to.   This model has a German accent as well, which is really the only way I can justify the price.  Hope this helps!",®

t5_2tnz9,Ropeguy,1353379017,"I find it hard to sympathize with people who constantly refer to Israel as a apartheid state or even comparing Israel to Nazi Germany since they throw around these definitions on nearly anything they don't like.    Last year I had to take a first year Social Science class in order to graduate. In my classes they would regularly call the country I lived in was an apartheid state and would only give the flimsiest of evidence to support that claim. Want to know where I live? CANADA.   If Canada is an apartheid state which after going on the Googs' is ""A policy or practice of separating or segregating groups."" then I have no idea what chance any country has. Don't get me wrong, Canada is not perfect but if Canada is so easily declared an apartheid state, what chance would Israel have with the tension surrounding this conflict?  Support Israel, Not supporting Israel it really doesn't matter to me. But after seeing how some of these people like throwing around words such as ""Nazi"", ""Holocaust"", and everyone's favorite ""Apartheid State™"" it makes it hard to try and get a grounded answers when instead your voice gets drowned out with buzzwords like you are playing the worlds shittiest game of Scrabble.",™

t5_2qjvn,brostep19,1353382900,"I like you. It's refreshing how aware and willing you are to examine. It seems rare, especially in females. If you communicate openly like this with him, it seems like it should be easy to resolve any issues between you. Unless it's just a relatability I'm experiencing, since your measured personality type is very similar to mine. What's his personality type?  I don't think you should shun your desires. You don't even seem to be asking for much at all. It feels good to make little gestures. It doesn't cost much, or require much effort. Its power is in the symbolic meaning, not matter; no mountain-moving required. It's just part of daily life together, where you form your own traditions and language of love.  Like if he wakes up in the morning still tired but has to get ready for work. You're still asleep, and he's just in his daily routine. He gets out of the shower, and is going through the motions, toweling dry, brushing teeth, and he goes to clear the fog off the mirror. But he thinks how you'll be up soon and will take a shower too. Then he sees the mirror, how you'll be standing here too, doing similar things, and he has an idea. He dips his finger into some soap, and draws you a little smiley face, with ""I ♥ U"". Then he goes about his business, and when the mirror dries it's not visible. But when you wake up, and are lost in your own thoughts, not paying attention because everything is out of muscle memory, you get out of the steamy shower, wrap towel around you, and awaken to a surprise as you see what he left for you, and your day is started with a smile.  That is so inexpensive physically. He didn't even have to walk a step out of his routine, yet it reminded you that he was thinking of you. That's all you want, to keep the love alive. Plants don't need to be watered every day, and they can go for stretches in the shade. But after too long, and they begin to wilt. It isn't expecting too much to have some rain and sunshine now and then. It replenishes the soil and provides what's needed to keep it going.  What about messages? Post-it notes are cute, but maybe those aren't around, and it's a waste of resources. But he must have a smartphone, right? Does he send you little things throughout the day? Does he share with you his thoughts and feelings, because he feels deeply connected and wants to express and share with you immediately? Does he ask about what you're doing? Does he send little presents, like cute pics, neat tidbits relevant to your interests, etc.?  When he's doing something for himself, does he do it for you too? Like if you both drink coffee, and have a machine to make it, when he's making one for him, does he do it for you too? Is there anything like that where he wants to share something new? Like, maybe you normally make coffee in the morning, and he doesn't drink it, but he knows you like it, so he's at work when he sees people enjoying this unusual flavor or recipe, and it totally looks like something you'd love, so he comes home excited and when you're all comfy and appear in the mood he whips it up with a sneaky smile, and serves to you this delicious treat, where your ""*mmm*"" gives him pleasure?  Does he derive pleasure from your pleasure? Is he thrilled to touch you, not because he's feeling the same sensual pleasures, but because it feels just as exciting to give you pleasure as it does to get? Does he want to pet you like a kitten, and make you tremble?  Is he creative?  Maybe it's partly his personality traits, but also his motivational system not being setup to feel rewards for the behaviors you want. Maybe it'd be possible to retrain some of that to feel pleasures from what gives you pleasures.  There could be lots of little ways you tax him and cause stress and frustration without being aware of how, or why. But you said you'd like to understand, so have you asked him? Can he identify it all and write out a list, so you can empathize with him? He might've tried to explain some things, but you not get it, so he just become angry. But can he write a report, where it's just a straight to the point outline? Maybe a big diagram, with both of you, then branches from each of you showing your inputs and outputs, then how those connect to each other. Then maybe he can calculate why there's not a balance where you're both replenishing each other, and what each of you specifically need to do.  It's funny because you said before something about wanting to play tennis sometimes, and that's like one of the least taxing sports ever. Even if you don't make it competitive, and just go out to try to see how many times you can keep the ball going back and forth. That sounds like fun, and it involves numbers, with scores. It'd also strengthen bonds, and be an activity of love.  It might be that marriage was primarily about organizing those in-and-out forces to form a system that actually produced something and had a chance of enduring long enough to maintain it for a while. The guys wanted the girls, and felt energy to single one out, then rush into her full speed. But then he's done, and is free to go.  Everything was codified though, to work with all those motivations, and keep it moving, like a locomotive steam engine. He has the fire, but it can't burn out so fast, because it's contained, and the oxygen choked to control its intensity. Then it's all channeled in ways that route the energy to move the vessel down the tracks.  Once that's gone, guys jerk off, kill some bad guys in a game, eat some snacks, and go to sleep. It's a fire burning with no utility. Not only that, but the fantasy of it all has allowed the desires to spread out in impossible directions where a lot of people can't even apply it in real life. It's a similar reason why some drugs are illegal.  But if we supposed that were just how life is today, and wanted females to get their fix too, then how could that be done? Typical male-rewards are easy to trigger, because there's little attachment required. You flash a picture of breasts, and the person need not even exist. It could be a computer graphical invention of a fictitious female, but the visual patterns trigger his senses, and he is aroused. He needs not know her name, speak to her, or even recognize she is sentient. All of that is irrelevant to his desires. She can be blind and deaf, which he never know, and still she serves as a sexy toy to reach the goal of climax.  But a female, while some have learned rewards in similar ways, typically need context. They can be aroused visually, and reach climax, but that's not the point. They feel those pleasures, but it's not the goal. Once they orgasm, they don't have that same sense of being done, like they beat the level, finished the game, got the ball in the final hole, and it's over. A guy, typically needs nothing else. His erection drops, and even touching the penis at that point can feel overly sensitive in a, ""Ow, go away!"" way, where just seconds before that same sensitivity was, ""Oh, MORE!""  So she cannot merely just masturbate to an image, or play a game filled with detached goals. She wants a story, a plot, a contextual involvement where there's sustained connection. She doesn't just want to collect the coins, she wants to know the character's name, and put the coins away in a treasure box, where they can be given to other characters with names, to write a story of life, love, and happiness.  That makes it inherently different, because he can wake up enough to watch some porn and masturbate, then it vanishes, with no trace. He didn't impregnate anyone, he doesn't know her name, he doesn't care at all about her and will probably never see her again. She's not anything but patterns of light. He's left with nothing but the residual effects, which are mostly a spent feeling of release where there is absence, and the resulting goo that came out his appendage.  How can you get the same? Your version likely requires knowing his name, having memory of him from before. Then your husband would be jealous and upset that you're having an emotional affair. Well, if he won't feed you love, then what are you supposed to do to have your needs fulfilled? He can masturbate to pictures of prostitutes, as a virtual version of stopping off at the brothel, but you sending love notes is cheating? It hardly seems fair, and just a technicality because his biological needs happen to not require context.   It's not really possible to have a female equivalent. If there were love-whore guys with websites, where they write romantic expressions, is that enough? Can you get attached to a guy you truly don't know? Can you visit a site, where you know his name, you read letters you feel could be addressed to you, he keeps you updated on his life, and you receive little text messages randomly every couple days, ""Papers are piling up, but I glimpsed a bird upon a branch outside the window, and lost in a daydream could only dream of you. Miss you. &lt;3""  But it's all porn? Where hundreds or thousands of women, in loveless marriages or isolated loneliness, get caught up in fictional fantasy? Do the husbands mind? Do they take it to be part of the new modern era, where marriage is formality, and porn is how we meet our needs? Do you both go to bed, he look at the girl he likes bent over in lingerie, and you read a love letter and see the pictures sent just to you, even though in reality both of you are 1 of many all looking at the same person? Why don't you both just roll over and look into each other's eyes, him being your love letter, and you being his slut?",♥

t5_2sv87,Imponaut,1353386768,"Not needy sounding at all, love questions, love discussion. I think that some larger creatures can have a place in this deck, and ultimately it depends on how you envision the deck winning. I like Thundermaw Hellkite, he might as well say ""Becomes unblockable when he enters the battlefield.""  I see your new list is running 47 cards, which leaves some room. I'd say cut Dispel entirely, bump your land count to 24 total (2 more of the Steam Vents and Sulfur Falls) and maybe weigh your basics more towards Mountains (based on the existing list. Keep an eye on your color breakdown, and build accordingly.)  I'll mention again that Curiosity is completely broken in this deck. Searing Spear? 2 to them and draw a card. Think Twice? 2 to them and draw two cards. It's nasty.  I run mine as a burn them to death via Guttersnipe, but again, follow your heart (or Izzet-Brand Vascular Turbine™) and test, test, test! There is nothing wrong with going through 11 builds of one deck before it clicks for you.",™

t5_2qh1i,thinkythought,1353390593,"This is exactly what I was thinking, but on a grander scale.   How much time do you have? See if you can apply for a street use permit. It shouldn't be too expensive.   Now go to some ""hertz rentals"" type place. Scout it out first for the cost of this. This should, in theory, cost less than about $500. The permit might be a couple hundred. Have a fundraiser and get as many people involved in the play, parents, etc to chip in. Ideally make this under $20 a person. I mean fuck it, you can spend that much at Taco Bell.   You need a big, like 26ft box truck, sections of chain link fence with either the wide metal foot bases(better) or the cinderblock ones, and several rolls of the cheapest white plastic sheeting from Home Depot/lows. Look for the really thin stuff they put on the outside of crappy scaffold jobs and in crawl spaces when they halfass it. Like 3mil or 5mil. Whatever's cheapest.   Now this is where the street use permit comes in. They always protest across the street. Build the fence all down the PARKING SPACES of most of the street. Like as far out as cars would usually be, then at the ends curving in toward the sidewalk. Your goal is to either make them stand behind it, or stand far enough away that everyone just drives by them on the way there and doesn't see them really when they're at the place.   If they try and stand IN FRONT of it, they're breaking *the law*™ and the cops will tell them to get back on the sidewalk. They're abstructing a motorway, bla bla bla. Loitering in the street is illegal in like every city and town in the US.    If you can't get the permit, you'll probably even still have some success with the fence. It will take them more than a couple hours to come tear it down. Probably until the next day. Have someone watching it, but not obviously. I'm sure there will be people milling around outside the school watching the protestors and etc. blend in.   everyone involved needs to be cool, and in on it. Park the truck a few blocks away. Set it up as quickly as possible beforehand, maybe right before sunrise. Wear reflective construction tshirts(cheap, goodwill often even has them) and utility belts if you can borrow them. Basically, look like you're doing something aboveboard, and DON'T TALK OR JOKE ABOUT IT UNTIL ITS OVER. Pick the fence up AFTER they leave and as quickly and quietly as possible. This will go better both directions if you can drum up a bunch of theater geeks or other friends to help load/unload the truck very quickly. I'm talking like 16-20 people.   You'll also need a cool parent to rent/drive the truck because of the rental rules, but at least when I was in highschool it wouldn't have been hard to find someone's smartass dad.   I can't think of a legitimate reason this is a bad idea. It's totally incidental the fences are there quote unquote. Those houses are getting their driveways repoured early next morning or some plausible excuse.   Speaking of which, what's across the street?   Regardless, the idea here is to create a ""free speech zone"" with some level of plausible deniability, at least a tiny bit, and give them the shit sandwich choice between standing in/behind your wall, or being far away.   And this varies from city to city, but in my city ""school grounds"" included the sidewalk ACROSS the street from the front and rear entrance. A sympathetic principle could call the cops they use for truancy issues, etc who are usually pretty buddy buddy with the schools and say that some protesting hooligans are going to be disrupting school activities by protesting there. Schools are not public property, even when they're public schools.  they can kick out whoever they want.   Honestly I fucking love the fence idea though, we almost did that here years ago against the same trolls.  **EDIT:** I missed a critical step! Start getting people to not park on that side, if its even legal parking for anything but schoolbuses or something, several days before. Paste up ""please don't park here, school project"" signs, or if you get your permit real fold out no parking signs.   If you have a permit, and towing yard will LOVE to tow the cars there. I'd try and avoid it if I could though, maybe just arc the fence around the car so they can drive off. That would just be mean and uncool :( if WBC people park there the night before though, power lulz. Get them towed at 7am or however early your permit starts and enjoy your sweet, 100% legal burn.   Also, when you apply for the permit, say its related to a school project, or even the play. And that you need reserved space to load and unload equipment from rental trucks or something plausible like that. Once you have the permit, you could set up fucking bouncy houses there. You've basically ""rented"" that space. WBC can call the cops or city, and the city will just go ""oh yea James fartymcmootz has a permit for that space until 10pm"" and they're *fucked*. Just make sure you read the entire street use permit cover to cover like five times.  **Tl;dr** get permits, rent a truck and fencing, and build an opaque fence in front of them that they can't legally stand in front of.

As such, your inquiry is being forwarded to the appropriate marketing teams for their review. &gt; &gt;We appreciate the time required to advise us of your concern. We hope you will continue to be one of our loyal consumers for many years to come. &gt; &gt;If you have any additional questions or comments, please contact us by calling 800-283-8915, Monday through Friday, 9:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time. &gt; &gt;Sincerely, &gt; &gt;Morgan &gt;Consumer Relations Representative          Only ever once before have I had a company tell me my inquiry was being forwarded to marketing. That resulted in the company introducing a small line of snack foods. I don't know if they'll do anything with this, but it's interesting to have that as the reply.         What they *didn't* do is give some kind of excuse for not considering the suggestion, like Godiva did when written to about their response to Howard Gordon's inquiry about adding Movember to the company's causes (since they raised funds for breast cancer in October.) It will be interesting to see if anything further comes of this.",®

t5_2qh7d,spasticpoodle,1353426288,"One other thing...  At the end of the season, you should try this:  1. Run the engine until it is at operating temperature. 2. Drain out remaining fuel. 3. Pour Sea Foam™ into the fuel tank. 4. Start engine. 5. Wait for engine to suck the sea foam in. You know it got to the engine because huge plumes of white will start coming out of the exhaust, and the engine will die. 6. Wait 5-10 mins. 7. Drain out remaining Sea Foam from fuel tank. 8. Remove spark plug. 9. Pour 1 tsp motor oil into cylinder, pull starter cord a few times to distribute oil throughout the cylinder. 10. Reinstall the spark plug.  What this process does is multi-pronged...  1. The sea foam displaces fuel in the carburetor, and cleans all of the orifices in the carb. This prevents varnish from forming in the carb. 2. When the sea foam is introduced into the combustion chamber, it causes built-up carbon deposits to be burned off. This helps your engine run better. 3. Pouring a small amount of oil into the combustion chamber, and then cycling the engine coats the cylinder in oil, helping to prevent the formation of rust / corrosion while in storage.  If your fuel tank were metal, I would suggest refilling it with stabilized gasoline to prevent corrosion, but since it is plastic, this is not necessary.",™

Detroit is good, but we should be better. Also I'm pretty sure this is the first good Thursday game all season.  --- [](/WAS) over [](/DAL) - Yeah okay Dallas, you beat Cleveland... in overtime. If RGIII can play as well as he did last week, they should be able to pull this off.  --- [](/NE) over [](/NYJ) - I feel like this could possibly be a trap game that the Patriots lose, but after their dismantling of the wildcard race-leading Colts, it's hard to see them losing this one.  --- [](/MIN) over [](/CHI) - Unless the Bears can get that O-line in check, Jared Allen and friends will have a field day on Campbell/Cutler.  That being said, it's hard to see Minnesotta scoring very much.  --- [](/CIN) over [](/OAK) - Is anyone picking Oakland at this point?  --- [](/PIT) over [](/CLE) - It saddens me to pick against Cleveland after that post this week, however, even without Baconburger, Pittsburgh will probably win.  --- [](/IND) over [](/BUF) - Colts will win after being destroyed last week.  --- [](/DEN) over [](/KC) - It would be exciting to see who the Chiefs chose as their quarterback, you know, if anyone cared, or if it mattered.  --- [](/SEA) over [](/MIA) - Tannehill won't be able to pass on the Sherman Tank and co.  --- [](/ATL) over [](/TB) - Tough call, but Falcons always seem to be able to pull off stupid close wins. I imagine Matt Ryan is going to be pretty motivated as well, so we'll see.  --- [](/JAC) over [](/TEN) - Chad Henne looked like Tom Brady last week throwing some stupidly accurate balls like [this one](http://cdn0.sbnation.com/imported_assets/1308527/jagsaregood_medium.gif) and [this one](http://cdn2.sbnation.com/imported_assets/1308557/houstonnuts_medium.gif), which make you wonder why he's a backup.  Assuming that wasn't a fluke they should be able to beat the Titans.  --- [](/BAL) over [](/SD) - Is there a single optimistic San Diego fan out there?  --- [](/STL) over [](/ARI) - Both these teams are playing bad and they should feel bad. Gotta pick one though, a tie might happen too.  --- [](/SF) over [](/NO) - Kaepernick Kaps off another win here, against an improved Saints team looking for a post-season spot.  Hehe, get it ""Kaps""... IT'S A JOKE. Hopefully he plays and my joke doesn't go to waste.  --- [](/GB) over [](/NYG) - Unless the Giants forgot it's November it'll be hard to expect anything good out of them. Giants fans shouldn't be worried though, this happens every year. Also the rest of the NFC East sucks Egg McMuffins™.  --- [](/CAR) over [](/PHI) - Foles and his foals will fall to fat cats in front of their fans.

If a simulation exists in any way that we can imagine it, it has boundries. If it were perfectly designed, it would be flawless within those boundries. Even if it is without boundries in terms of limits on specific values (speed, displacement, size, mass, whatever), there would need to be a limit on the scope of the simulation, unless our simulation is being carried out in a limitless world. (i.e. as we understand devices, they have limits in their computing power and storage. Even if that limit were inimaginably large, the limit would still exist.

t5_2s5jo,Trees4twenty,1353438257,"here i just copied it from a rollitup site… too much to type. talking about pro-tek silica here. Ive used several that worked great.   The latest research proves that plants benefit in many important ways from supplemental soluble silicon. These benefits include greater tolerance of environmental stresses such as cold, heat, drought, salinity, mineral toxicity or deficiency, improved growth rates, accelerated root development on cuttings and improved resistance to insects and fungi. Soluble silicon promotes natural fungal defense mechanisms in plants, significantly reducing, and in many cases eliminating entirely, the need to use fungicides. Silicon deposited in epidermal cell walls enhances plants' resistance to small sucking insects. The resulting increased mechanical strength in epidermal cell walls enhances leaf presentation to light and improved stem strength. Soluble silicon enhances metabolic functions and plant growth rates by balancing nutrient uptake, distribution and transport and increasing chlorophyll concentration in leaves resulting in improved pollen fertility, fruit and flower count. Silicon deposition in the plant's epidermal cell layer acts as a barrier against penetration of fungal hyphae from powdery mildew, black spot, Pythium and Phytophthora, etc. Silicon is selectively transported to the site of fungal infection and is utilized by the plant metabolically to combat the growth of fungi. Silicon is also incorporated into cell walls improving heat, drought and cold tolerance by reducing transpiration. The added mechanical strength makes the plant less dependent upon osmotic pressure for leaf and stem turgidity. Silicon, selectively transported to the site of fungal infection, plays an active metabolic role in combating fungal growth by the production of polyphenolic compounds, part of a plant's natural defenses against fungi and insects. Silicon is rapidly bound in leaf tissue and deposited in a non-translocatable form within 24 hours of uptake. Therefore a continuous source of soluble silicon is very important to combat pathogens. This can be from constant feeding in hydroponics or from retention in the growing medium. In some plants, foliar applications appear to lead to even lower rates of disease. Silicon, taken up by the plant via the roots, is moved to old leaves first, whereas fungal infections tend to attack the new growth first. Foliar application to the new growth Pro-TeKts the tender new leaves. Foliar sprays of soluble silicon have also been shown to be effective for the control of aphids and other sucking insects on many plants. Epidermal cell walls containing silicon deposits act as a mechanical barrier to insects. In addition to the silicate deposits in the leaves, the intracellular content of silicic acid also acts as an effective sap sucking inhibitor for many insects. Discover the Benefits of Silicon Nutrition in Your Plants! Pro-TeKt ® “Silicon Increases Resistance to Pathogens In growth tests at the University of Florida dry weight in Dendrobium nobile, Aeschmea fasciata, Spathiphyllum and Anthurium scherzerianum provided 49 ppm soluble silicon increased from 18% to 80% over the dry weight of control plants grown without supplemental silicon. 32 of the 39 species evaluated in this test took up additional silicon when it was provided. Those plants are considered Si-responsive and had greater leaf thickness as well as greater dry weight. Silicon Increases Metabolic Rates and Stress Resistance Soil and Soilless Mixes: Apply Pro-TeKt® at a rate of 1:1500 to 1:3000 (1/2 tsp to 1/4 tsp/gal) depending upon the plants' requirements. Hydroponics: Continuously feed Pro-TeKt® at a rate of 1:750 (1 tsp/gal). Research has shown that silicon benefits plants in the following ways: improved resistance to wilt, resistance to water stress (heat and drought), enhanced leaf presentation resulting in improved light interception, enhanced reproductive growth, and increased tolerance of zinc deficiencies, cold temperatures, excessive phosphorus, manganese, sodium and aluminum concentrations. Silicon, deposited in the cell walls, forms a protective layer reducing transpiration through the outer cells. Silicon deposits in the cell walls of xylem vessels prevent compression of the vessels under conditions of high transpiration caused by drought or heat stress. Temperatures much above 90° F cause plants to virtually cease their metabolic functions because water is lost through transpiration faster than it can be replaced via the plant's root system. This results in harmful increases in intracellular mineral concentrations that inhibit plant functions. Increased levels of silicon in cell walls reduce transpiration loss caused by higher temperatures and the low humidity of typical interior growing conditions thus allowing continued metabolic functions at higher temperatures. Plants wilt less, resist sunburn and are generally more tolerant of heat stresses. Cuttings and plugs are more tolerant of the stresses encountered during root formation and potting up as a result of decreased transpiration. Studies at the Universities of Florida and Minnesota have shown significantly increased success rates in propagation of cuttings when silicon is applied foliarly through a misting system, or as a drench or soak prior to sticking. The surfactant characteristics of Pro-TeKt® result in better uptake of water and the minerals dissolved in it for better nutrition and growth. Silicon has also been shown to result in higher concentrations of chlorophyll per unit area of leaf tissue. This means that a plant is able to tolerate both lower and higher light levels by using more of the available light. Moreover, supplemental levels of soluble silicon have been shown to produce higher concentrations of the enzyme RUBP carboxylase in leaf tissue. This enzyme regulates the metabolism of carbon dioxide and enables the plant to make more efficient use of available levels of CO2. Silicon deficiencies often are indicated by malformation of young leaves and a failure of pollination and fruit formation in many cases. Plants with silicon added to the nutrient formula also show delayed leaf and flower senescence. The shelf life of cut flowers, specialty pot crops and plugs is also extended. Leaves are thicker and darker green compared to those grown without soluble silicon.   Here is a link that explains how it helps with certain micro nute uptake and lockouts http://www.fngla.org/reports/75/finalreport.pdf  Here is a quote from an article at Maximum Yield (one of my new favorite sites, see sig link),,,,,,,,,  Silica – the missing macro element  Silica is much more than a trace element in many plant species. In fact silica is considered to be a beneficial macro element for many crops with a wide range of benefits for hydroponic crop production. Several plants need silica for growth including rice, sugar cane and tomatoes. Silica is transported from the roots and travels up to the shoot in the xylem vessels and is deposited mainly as hydrated silica dioxide or as polysilicic acids. Once silica has been incorporated into plant issue in this form, it can’t be redistributed throughout the plant, so it needs to be in constant supply if the entire plant is to contain a useful amount. The use of soluble forms of silica as an additive in hydroponics is not new; many cucumber and rose growers are aware of the benefits of adding silica to the nutrient solution, whether it is in an organic or non organic form. Silica in cucumbers, for example, reduces the incidence and severity of powdery mildew and other fungi. Silica contributes to the strength and thickness of cell walls, helping to keep leaves in a good position for good light interception and to resist attacks by fungi and insects. Silica also assists with the absorption and translocation of several macro and micro nutrients and plays a role in allowing plants to survive and thrive in adverse growing conditions such as high salinity or excess elements in the solution or soil. Silica in solution should, however, not be considered a micro element; levels as high as 140 ppm have been shown to have the most significant results since silica is naturally found in many plant tissues at up to 10 per cent or higher (dry weight). In the past silica has been a difficult element to supply at high rates in hydroponic nutrient solutions. Chemical forms such as potassium metasilicate not only have a very high pH, but tend to form a glassy like substance, which blocks drippers and emitters when the enriched nutrient solution comes into contact with the air. These days more forms of silica are available on the hydroponic market and nutrient products and supplements containing silica as a macro element are readily available and easy to use.  ",®

Do you think that they think of themselves as terrorists? What labels do you think that they use to describe Israel, partially as a result of being branded terrorists? Their labels are, I'm sure, as equally laden with negative connotations, and therefore just as unhelpful in resolving the conflict.  Again, just to make sure, I'm not in any way condoning their actions, but rather attempting to point out that the words we use to describe each other end up framing the discussion. It results in negotiations being a non-starter from the get-go. Israeli's cannot be reasonably expected to negotiate with people they view as terrorists. And they view them as such because they label them as such. Just as the Palestinians cannot be expected to negotiate reasonably with what they view as an illegal, oppressive, occupying force. Even calling them Israelis vs. Palestinians is similarly but of a lesser magnitude anti-helpful. They are all people.  Yet every human being on both sides is nothing more than a corporeal meatbag made of mostly water that eats, shits, and loves. If each constituent member would realize this all at the same time, and simply decide to stop fighting, the conflict will have ended.  They aren't different because they were born of Israeli or Palestinian vaginas. Swap two of them at birth and see which side they fight for. So it obviously is not genetic. They view each other as different because they've been taught that they are and have decided to oppose each other. Each generation has the chance to choose, and can even change their minds later, but for a variety of reasons they do not. One of those reasons is the persistent perpetuation of labeling.  You see Palestine vs. Israel. I see a bunch of people caught in a loop, none of which want to die. And the labels on both sides serve greatly to perpetuate it because the hostility is a learned thing. And everyone involved in the fighting on both sides chooses to be. We are all capable of changing our minds at any point. Just as soon as we realize that we can.  Just a different perspective on things.

That's cuz you're really really dumb.   &gt;Keynesian economists **believe** that in the short run, productive activity is influenced by aggregate demand (total spending in the economy) and that aggregate demand does not necessarily equal aggregate supply (the total productive capacity of the economy). Instead it is influenced by a host of factors and sometimes behaves erratically, affecting production, employment and inflation.[1]  &amp;  &gt;Austrian economist Friedrich Hayek criticized Keynesian economic policies for what he called their fundamentally ""collectivist"" approach, arguing that such theories encourage centralized planning, which leads to malinvestment of capital, which is the cause of business cycles. Hayek also argued that Keynes's study of the aggregate relations in an economy is fallacious, as recessions are caused by micro-economic factors. Hayek claimed that what starts as temporary governmental fixes usually become permanent and expanding government programs, which stifle the private sector and civil society.[29]  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keynesian_economics  ---     I can see you're a ""believer"" in that flawed system, and though both math and history are against you, you suspend disbelieving in facts to maintain belief in Keynes.   *Don't stop ""believing!

It's not even a choice. You simply are not convinced.  Next try the outsider's test of faith. Why are they christian instead of muslim or mormon? Show the link between childhood indocrination (where and when you were born) and your beliefs. Based on no better or worse evidence than the other religions.  If you want specific advice refuting the design-based arguments (who created life, species, consciousness, the universe, morality, etc.) or any other particular arguments (ontological, cosmological, transcendental), I think we can help with that too.  Bible verses all day:  Numbers 31 31:15 And Moses said unto them, Have ye saved all the women alive?  31:17 Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him.  31:18 But all the women children, that have not known a man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves.   Women's rights: Genesis 3:16  Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.   Isaiah 3:12  As for my people, children are their oppressors, and women rule over them.   1 Corinthians 11:3  But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God.   1 Corinthians 14:34-36  Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but they are commanded to be under obedience as also saith the law. And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church.   Ephesians 5:22-24  Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body. Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing.   1 Timothy 2:11-15  Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection. But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence. For Adam was first formed, then Eve. And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression. Notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing.   Titus 2:4-5  Teach the young women to be ... obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.   1 Peter 3:1  Likewise, ye wives, be in subjection to your own husbands.   Psalm 137: 9   English Standard Version (©2001) Blessed shall he be who takes your little ones and dashes them against the rock!  1 Timothy 2:12 (King James Version)  12But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence.  Deuteronomy 22:28-29 (King James Version)  28If a man find a damsel that is a virgin, which is not betrothed, and lay hold on her, and lie with her, and they be found;   29Then the man that lay with her shall give unto the damsel's father fifty shekels of silver, and she shall be his wife; because he hath humbled her, he may not put her away all his days.  Leviticus 25:44 English Standard Version (©2001) As for your male and female slaves whom you may have: you may buy male and female slaves from among the nations that are around you.  Deuteronomy 22 22:20 But if this thing be true, and the tokens of virginity be not found for the damsel:  22:21 Then they shall bring out the damsel to the door of her father's house, and the men of her city shall stone her with stones that she die: because she hath wrought folly in Israel, to play the whore in her father's house: so shalt thou put evil away from among you.  ""But those mine enemies, which would not that I should reign over them, bring hither, and slay them before me."" (Luke 19:27. In a parable, but spoken of favorably.)  John 15:6 If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned.  Jesus encouraged the beating of slaves: ""And that servant [slave], which knew his lord's will, and prepared not himself, neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes."" (Luke 12:47)  Matthew 10:34 ""Do not suppose that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I did not come to bring peace, but a sword.  Jesus said that whoever calls somebody a ""fool"" shall be in danger of hell fire (Matthew 5:22), yet he called people ""fools"" himself (Matthew 23:17)  1 Samuel 15  15:2 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I remember that which Amalek did to Israel, how he laid wait for him in the way, when he came up from Egypt.	     15:3 Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass. Matthew 5:17-18 17 Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.  18 I tell you the truth, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished. New International Version (©1984) The LORD was with the men of Judah. They took possession of the hill country, but they were unable to drive the people from the plains, because they had iron chariots. Kings 2 2:23 And he went up from thence unto Bethel: and as he was going up by the way, there came forth little children out of the city, and mocked him, and said unto him, Go up, thou bald head; go up, thou bald head.  2:24 And he turned back, and looked on them, and cursed them in the name of the LORD. And there came forth two she bears out of the wood, and tare forty and two children of them.    34:13 And thorns shall come up in her palaces, nettles and brambles in the fortresses thereof: and it shall be an habitation of dragons, and a court for owls.  34:14 The wild beasts of the desert shall also meet with the wild beasts of the island, and the satyr shall cry to his fellow; the screech owl also shall rest there, and find for herself a place of rest.   ""And if your hand or your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it from you; it is better for you to enter life crippled or lame, than having two hands or two feet, to be cast into the eternal fire,"" (Matt. 18:8).  ""And these will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life"" (Matt. 25:46).   31 “Behold, I am against you, O arrogant one,” Declares the Lord God of hosts, “For your day has come, The time when I will punish you  ""And the devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are also; and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever,"" (Rev. 20:10).  http://carm.org/hell-eternal ",©

t5_2qh1i,Itkovan,1353477234,"&gt; the bureaus will still double ding you for multiple inquiries that aren't on the same credit bureau on the same day.   Not entirely accurate either, according to [myfico.com](http://www.myfico.com/crediteducation/creditinquiries.aspx): *Looking for a mortgage, auto or student loan may cause multiple lenders to request your credit report, even though you are only looking for one loan. To compensate for this, the score ignores mortgage, auto, and student loan inquiries made in the 30 days prior to scoring. So, if you find a loan within 30 days, the inquiries won't affect your score while you're rate shopping. In addition, the score looks on your credit report for mortgage, auto, and student loan inquiries older than 30 days. If it finds some,* **it counts those inquiries that fall in a typical shopping period as just one inquiry when determining your score**. *For FICO scores calculated from older versions of the scoring formula, this shopping period is any 14 day span. For FICO scores calculated from the newest versions of the scoring formula, this shopping period is any 45 day span. Each lender chooses which version of the FICO scoring formula it wants the credit reporting agency to use to calculate your FICO score.*   In other words you are probably correct for all types of inquiries except mortgage, auto, and student loan inquiries.  For those mentioned categories your information is definitely not correct.  At least according to myfico.com.  However, they are kinda the authorities on FICO scores **since they invented them**: ""[myFICO® is the consumer division of Fair Isaac, the company that invented the FICO® credit risk score that lenders use.](http://www.myfico.com/Company/AboutUs.aspx)",®

t5_2qh1i,wugs,1353480033,"I worked as a ""bagger"" at Food Lion, a grocery store chain under Delhaize Group (they also do Bloom, Bottom Dollar, and a couple other chains).  ""Bagger"" was my unofficial title, the one people would be familiar with. The company called me a ""service associate"" and I was basically a bitch boy.  * The packaged meats are, in my opinion, really clean and safe. The sanitation in that area of my store was outstanding, and I worked in a pretty crap store. * I'd think it would be common sense, but don't go shopping on the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd of a month, or the first weekend of a month unless you HAVE to. Those were the shittest times to work just due to the busyness * Always grab from the back. People usually know to do this with things like bread -- (If you weren't aware, new bread, if shelved according to Food Lion policy, is in the back. This was part of my job and I got yelled at once for just pushing the old bread to the back. It makes sense because if it goes bad it gets wasted.) -- but it's important for the weirdest things. The manager that hired me originally got fired because the district manager caught her on tape using deodorant off the shelf and then putting it back. Stockers put the shittiest goods, the ones that ALMOST have to be trashed, but not quite, in the front. * If you have your bagger carry your groceries to your car and really want to tip him/her, do it outside. We can't accept tips, technically speaking, but one woman who I saw often once said I ""looked like I was having a bad day"" and gave me $20 covertly. She obviously became my favorite customer and we chatted a lot after that as I helped her. * If you drop something and it breaks, PLEASE TELL SOMEONE IMMEDIATELY. You would not believe the number of people that will step in a mess and make it worse in the fifteen or thirty minutes it might take an employee to notice the spill. It's rare for the person cleaning to get upset with the person making the mess, but if you're really afraid of that, immediately tell a cashier. That person won't have to clean up the mess regardless, and they'll call someone else for you. Bottom line: the quicker we can get to the mess, the less of a mess we have to deal with. * Don't. Bring. In. Fake. Coupons. When 4chan figured out that coupon counterfeiting thing, my entire store stopped accepting printed coupons. There's nothing worse than having to tell a 65-year-old woman that her printed coupon isn't accepted just because a bunch of Really Cool™ middle schoolers want free Monsters. * If you wear a bookbag in the store and look remotely under 21, prepare to be watched like a fucking hawk. You could probably get away with drinking in the bathrooms, though, since there's a trashcan and no surveillance.",™

t5_2smxb,hexarin,1353520043,"Over the course of the series Erikson grows up as an author, and the writing improves.  AFAIK GotM is his first published piece of literature, and its rough edges reflect that.  The high tone of the prose, particularly at the start of the book, also irked me.  That morphs into more palatable writing as time goes on, but be prepare to roll your eyes on occasion.   MbotF's somewhat unconventional structure can also compound one's confusion.  Keeping up with characters and places can also be bewildering, and though this tradition is kept up throughout the series it does get easier.  The perspective from which the story is told is also constantly shifting.  You'll get perspective on events from a number of different sources.  This can be a rich source of detail, but it will also probably leave you saying, ""wait, who is this again?"".  Introductory text frequently doesn't feel that way, or feels incomplete.  Some will see this as a weakness, but I believe it is very much intentional.  The narrative doesn't exist to tell a single story about a single person or people (though it *is* nominally about the ""Malazans"").  The author has stated that he wanted his books to be a window into a time and place in his world.  You've got to get used to not having the whole story.  This can make you feel smart (or stupid...) as you piece together clues (or don't...) about the intricate world.  Even if you don't end up putting things together, Erikson also occasionally comes right out and gives you the answers.  That can be annoying or a relief, depending. YMMV.  The book is chock full of detail that ends up being foreshadowing, though in a much less focused way than KKC.  Offhand mentions of far off places and obscure players are priming the reader for eventually going to those places, and meeting those players.  It just might take another million words to get there.  Seriously, some ideas are dialed in from a ridiculous distance.  You might forget the details along the way on a first read through, but rereads really shine as you've got a lot more context to fit them into.  Gardens of the Moon is far from a perfect book.  You've got to be willing to give the author a chance (and by chance, I mean hundreds of pages) to find his voice.  I found the climax of the book to be a worthy payoff with no shortage of badassery™ going on.  I'd go on to say that the series as a whole is a treasure trove of cool ideas, characters, dialog and subversion of bad fantasy tropes.  It is *really* long however.  If you dig it like I do/did, it will fall under ""more to love"".",™
t5_2qh1o,bradfish123,1353520161,"http://www.animaleyecare.net/diseases/pra.htm  ok, so PRA is a genetic disease which causes cataracts late in life, but fixing the cataracts won't help anything...  &gt;Dogs with PRA usually develop cataracts that are termed ""toxic cataracts"", in the mid to late stages of PRA. Cataracts are opacities within the lens, and usually both eyes of dogs with PRA develop cataracts. There are many causes of toxic cataracts, but the most common cause in dogs is PRA. As the retinal tissue slowly dies, it releases toxic by-products of cell death that are absorbed by the lens, causing lens damage and cataract development. The cataracts can be severe enough to aggravate vision loss. In addition to supporting retinal health in dogs with PRA, antioxidant nutritional supplementation may help reduce the severity and slow the progression of toxic cataracts. If retinal function is completely lost in a dog with PRA but toxic cataracts are mild, antioxidant supplementation with Ocu-GLO Rx™ might be continued in these patients to help support lens health in an attempt to delay cataract progression. This is because while vision cannot be restored, there can be painful complications from the development of advanced cataracts. Cataract surgery would not be performed in these patients, as it would not help restore any functional vision.",™
t5_2ranw,farfigneugan,1353520282,"*Desiderata*    Go placidly amid the noise and haste, and remember what peace there may be in silence. As far as possible without surrender be on good terms with all persons. Speak your truth quietly and clearly; and listen to others, even the dull and ignorant; they too have their story. Avoid loud and aggressive persons, they are vexations to the spirit. If you compare yourself with others, you may become vain and bitter; for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.  Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans. Keep interested in your career, however humble; it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time. Exercise caution in your business affairs; for the world is full of trickery. But let this not blind you to what virtue there is; many persons strive for high ideals; and everywhere life is full of heroism.  Be yourself. Especially, do not feign affection. Neither be critical about love; for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment it is as perennial as the grass.  Take kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering the things of youth. Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune. But do not distress yourself with imaginings. Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness. Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself.  You are a child of the universe, no less than the trees and the stars; you have a right to be here. And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should.  Therefore be at peace with God, whatever you conceive Him to be, and whatever your labors and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life keep peace with your soul. With all its sham, drudgery and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful world. Be careful. Strive to be happy.  © Max Ehrmann 1927",©

t5_2qhwp,Pharnaces_II,1353522218,"I guess I can give a quick overview:  * The Walking Dead  Fantastic game with a really touching story. The latest episode just came out in the last few days so the story is complete. Not much in the way of gameplay, it's mostly a game where you talk to people and solve simple puzzles.   Recommendation: Buy  * Age of Empires 3  Don't bother. AOE3 was an okay RTS when it launched but it never *felt* like Age of Empires and suffered from some balancing problems in multiplayer. No one plays it anymore, really, and the campaigns aren't very memorable. Age of Empires 2 can be found for like $2 online or pirated since Ensemble is dead (RIP ;_;) and is better in every way.   Recommendation: Don't buy  * XCOM  Definitely a controversial game. It's simplified, consolized, and has a lot of RNG. If that bothers you look elsewhere, but if you're looking for a tactical shooter and can accept getting instagibbed because you rolled a bad number then it may be worth picking up. There are 3 planned pieces of DLC, though, so you might just want to wait until next year's Summer Sale.  Recommendation: Buy it in another sale unless you want it right now.  * Darksiders 2  It's like Darksiders 1 but better. Can feel pretty grindy and you'll get lost in doing quests to solve quests to solve more quests to move forward in the story. Not a very challenging game, but definitely one of the best recent hack'n'slashers. The PC port had some problems but I'm pretty sure they've mostly been ironed out by now. Lots of DLC, so if that bothers you wait for a GOTY edition.   Recommendation: Buy or wait for GOTY edition  * Terraria  It's like Minecraft but different. If you're into that get it, if you're not don't. I've had lots of friends put 100+ hours into it easily without getting bored and there's still a decent sized community around for it.   Recommendation: Buy it.  * MTG  I've never played it but my friend who is into MTG tells me that this series is crap and you should get the Magic Workstation tool instead. Don't take my word for it, though.  edit: See Lotier's post for details on the game:  &gt;The point of the game is more to learn Magic: The Gathering. It is a small controlled subset of M:tG. If you just want some playtime with Magic, its great. If you want to full Magic experience, start playing with paper cards or get involved with Magic: The Gathering Online. (I, in fact, would argue that Magic Workstation is pirating Magic cards as the money spend on it doesn't go at all to the Wizards of the Coast.)  Recommendation: None  Flash sales:  * PAYDAY  This game is awesome. It's like Left4Dead except you do lots of different heists and there's a huge persistent upgrade system that, when completed, gives you access to a pretty damn hard difficulty setting called Overkill 145+. Lots of random elements like Left4Dead so each playthrough feels different and there's a lot of replayability. Tons of secrets, too. Best in coop because the squadmate AI is kind of doofy but 2 people can play it just fine.  Recommendation: Buy it and its DLC and get a friend to do the same  * Operation Flashpoint franchise  It's like the original Operation Flashpoint, but shit. Pass, get ARMA 2 or wait for ARMA 3 instead.  Recommendation: Pass  * The Amazing Spiderman  It's like the old Spiderman games, but shit.   Recommendation: Pass  * Limbo  Some people, myself included, call Limbo incredibly pretentious. It's short, sweet, and the art style gets in the way of progression numerous times throughout the game. If you're into the ""games are art"" movement Limbo may be for you, if not I'd say pass.  Recommendation: Decide for yourself  * Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic 2  If you like roleplaying games and haven't played KOTOR 2 you should be ashamed of yourself. It is, without a doubt, one of the best games of all time. Great story, great choices, and one of the only pieces of Star Wars media that isn't black and white.

t5_2qh3s,jimbonics,1353523064,"So this seems like as good a place as any to share my Limo + Star Wars story...  1999, driving a Hummer Limo around Miami. I get a call from the company, asking me if I want to drive around R2-D2 (Kenny Baker), Darth Vader (David Prowse), and Boba Fett (Jeremy Bullock) for two days while they were in town for some comic con promoting the upcoming Phantom Shitass.   You're god damned right I did!   I was pretty stoked, so I picked up a bottle of champagne and OJ to treat them to some Mimosas, since it was around an 11am pickup on a Saturday.   They were staying at some below-average Holiday Inn, immediately taking any and all glamor out of my Star Wars Fantasy. In addition to the three dudes, there was also Kenny Bakers SO, who will henceforth be known as Midget-Wife.   So I show up, get out of the 28ft. Hummer limo (in 1999 these things were pretty rare), and introduce myself. Darth Vader is 9 feet fucking tall, Boba Fett is just some pasty-faced Brit, and Kenny Baker and Midget-Wife were most certainly NOT 9 feet tall.   I open the door to the Hummer for them, and a nice step-ladder automatically juts out. Even so, I can see R2D2 and M-W™ are going to have issues. R2D2 also realizes this, and informs me I'm going to have to lift him into the limo. O....K. So he turns away from me, and I assumed, WRONGLY, that I was to just grab him by the waist and lift him in there like a little Ewok. (I found out quite a bit later that he actually WAS a fucking Ewok in addition to R2D2..) It was at that point that I was told to STOP! and was then instructed I was to lift him by his elbows. His fucking ELBOWS. So he puts his arms rigidly to his side, points his hands out in front of him, palms up, and tells me to lift. By his elbows.   Fun Fact: Despite their diminutive size, midgets are pretty fucking heavy, especially when lifting them by their god-damned elbows.   So yeah, I almost dropped the little fucker. I then had to repeat the process for Midget-Wife. All the while I have their best-friend 9 footer and Boba Fett looking on with stoic amusement. I mean, you couldn't tell by looking at them, but they had to be dying inside. Darth Vader could have picked up both of them by the nape of their necks and tossed them inside, because, my god, he's 9 feet tall and they're midgets who deserve to be tossed.   Anyway, everyone is packed inside, I give them the run-down and show them the bubbly on ice and the OJ, telling them feel free to make some mimosas.   ""You mean Bucks Fizz"" Midget-Wife corrects me.   Huh?  ""Bucks Fizz is what we call it on the other side of the pond.""  So I not only learned that in Brittania Mimosas are called Bucks Fizz, but that the Atlantic Ocean is in fact a fucking POND.   So I drop these guys off at the 'con, pick them up, and repeat the same thing the next day. I'm having fun with it and being jolly, because it's Darth Vader, Boba Fett, R2D2, and Midget-Wife for fucks sake.   Final tally: 16 hours, 8 midget lifts and two bottles of champagne.   Guess how much they fucking tipped. ",™

t5_2qm4e,Mordisquitos,1353529010,"You must take into consideration some things.  First of all (and you might already know this), biological hazards come in [different levels](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biohazard#Levels_of_biohazard). The word ""biohazard"" and its symbol (☣) have both acquired a terrifying image in the popular imagination, and people generally associate them only with things that will kill you and everyone you know in a very graphic way. All they actually mean is: *""this presents a hazard which is (micro)biological in nature""*, whichever the level. For instance: the cold virus presents the hazard that you will feel under the weather and sneeze for a few days, lab strains of *E. coli* present the hazard that they just about might infect someone immunocompromised, and the Ebola virus presents the hazard that it will kill you and everyone you know in a very graphic way.   Secondly, biohazard risks are considered in a fundamentally different way from other hazards. Chemical and radiological hazards both have a tolerable exposure threshold for workers and the general population beneath which no damage is caused. As biological hazards are caused by microorganisms, which could theoretically (but probably not in practice) cause infection from a single unit, there is no tolerable exposure threshold.   With this in mind, when dealing with human tissue and blood samples from multiple origins, they are always considered hazardous by default in a laboratory or clinical environment. The people who work with blood and tissue samples might come into contact with many hundreds of different samples in a week. Of those samples, perhaps not a single one of them contains any blood-borne pathogens. However:  + If even one of the samples were to be positive for something as relatively benign as [Cytomegalovirus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_cytomegalovirus) that would already constitute a biological hazard to the worker (there is a small chance of a mononucleosis-like disease). + There is no acceptable exposure threshold to the possibly infected samples. + The worker will go through hundreds of these samples, which might even have something nastier.  So, what's the safest course of action? All blood and tissue samples are treated as biohazardous by default in a laboratory or clinical environment. It's simple risk management.  The fact is that the ""biohazard"" label is applied to blood and tissue samples basically because there is a small but significant _chance_ that there might be something in there that will cause disease (of any kind). Your own blood will obviously not be hazardous to yourself, and you can probably assume that neither will your sexual partner's if you already don't use protection. Also, for example, if a friend is bleeding to death, please don't be afraid to apply pressure to the wound just because it would mean coming into contact with something that would be labelled as ""biohazardous"" if it were in a lab. Blood may be yucky, but unless you know your bleeding friend has a really nasty disease the risk you are taking by helping him or her is minuscule.",☣

t5_2qlqh,nawoanor,1353530592,"That's not ""lag"" you're seeing (in the traditional sense), it's called ""slop space"" and it's probably not going away.  It probably *can't* go away.  Android relies heavily on ""touch and hold"" actions, and from when you first touch the screen to when you're pushing on it a little, the center of your ""touch"" moves slightly as your finger flattens onto the screen.  This would normally be interpreted as you sliding your finger across the screen a few pixels, making whatever's on the screen move and probably meaning you won't be selecting the the thing you meant to select anymore.  To eliminate this effect, ""slop space"" was introduced.  Slop space makes it so that unless your touch point has moved least [x] distance (16 pixels by default IIRC) in [y] amount of time, it's ignored.  You can go into the kernel and reduce or eliminate slop space and scrolling will suddenly be iOS-like, but a touch-and-hold action will be very difficult to perform.  I imagine a talented programmer could probably reduce the effect somewhat through some clever logic and predictive interpolation, but long story short: what you're seeing isn't a **hardware performance** issue.  If and when someone ""fixes"" the issue somehow, all existing hardware will scroll more smoothly assuming they get the relevant OS update (ha ha ha).  In any case, I suspect that there's probably a good reason why this issue at least as old as Android 1.5 hasn't been addressed.  This is probably a case where the Smart People™ know better than the end-users.",™

t5_2r0f4,AmbiguousNorth,1353548364,"It would be fairly nice to compile data on my sleep patterns but the only use for it that seems to relate to lucid dreaming is the 'SmartWake™' setting that will wake you just prior to REM sleep, so you can attempt WILD. I can get roughly the same effect with a watch alarm and some knowledge of the duration of sleep states.  This product probably works well doing what it is designed for but its potential use in lucid dreaming practice is only a secondary application and sort of an after-thought, making it not really worth the $99 + S/H in my opinion.

t5_2tk95,JayKayAu,1353560984,"This is one of those situations where trying to be balanced skews reality.  E.g., one doesn't dispute the consensus that racism is bad just because some countries still have racist policies.  Racism is *obviously* bad, it's *obviously* destructive, it's *obviously* negative.  To shrug your shoulders and say ""well, some think that racism is okay, so I'm going to be balanced about it"" is ridiculous. That's not balanced, it's Fox News style Fair-and-Balanced™.  There's no reason you would pussy-foot around with colours on a chart in case you offended racists. You'd simply use your basic judgement and use a ""bad"" colour (e.g., red) to highlight racism, and a ""good/neutral"" colour (e.g., light blue/green) to highlight non-racism.  This is the same realisation we've come to over homophobia. One *should* use a ""bad"" colour for homophobia/discrimination and a ""good/neutral"" colour for equality/non-discrimination.  Being non-discriminatory **is** the neutral position, whether you're talking about race or homosexuality.",™

t5_2qh33,kingofnynex,1353574235,"First of all, fuck you faggot.  Second:  Usage Note: For more than a hundred years, critics have remarked on the incoherency of using literally in a way that suggests the exact opposite of its primary sense of “in a manner that accords with the literal sense of the words.” In 1926, for example, H.W. Fowler cited the example “The 300,000 Unionists . . . will be literally thrown to the wolves.” The practice does not stem from a change in the meaning of literally itself—if it did, the word would long since have come to mean “virtually” or “figuratively”—but from a natural tendency to use the word as a general intensive meaning “without exaggeration,” as in They had literally no help from the government on the project, where no contrast with the figurative sense of the words is intended. This looser use of the word literally does not usually create problems, but it can lead to an inadvertently comic effect when the word is used together with an idiomatic expression that has its source in a frozen figure of speech, such as in I literally died laughing.

t5_2qq5e,hapea,1353615348,"My friend just posted this open letter from Oshan this morning, thought I'd share with you all. I really appreciated the love that Om Shan Tea spread and will be thinking of him on this Thanksgiving day.   Open Letter from Oshan in Jail  Dear Family, Friends and Allies, ... I am writing to let you know about my current situation. As many of you know, I have been fighting a legal case for two and a half year, accused of distributing psychedelics, with charges punishable by 10 years or more in federal prison. The weight of having this hanging over my head for years has been an agonizing experience, ca using extreme exhaustion , stress, and a deep depression. Despite this, I did the best I could to keep running my teahouse, my mobile tea services, teaching school kids about tea ceremony, hosting hundreds of spiritual dance, music and poetry events, throwing large intentional parties (Heartform, Tecompression) and striving to build community and contribute to the world as best I could. In the end I ran out of energy and my massive debts due to my legal fees caused me to close my teahouse down. I did this with great sadness and regret as poured so much money and years of my life into it. I hope that it had some lasting benefit to the bay are community and beyond. For more than 4 years, I haven't had more than 2 days break from my work and have longed for a vacation. I finally have it now, although tragically not on the beaches or in the forests as I had dreamed of.  Two and half years of fighting my case included a number of unsuccessful legal motions, relating to the impropriety of the DEA officers actions during my arrest and search. I believe these motions were denied due to a reactionary bias of the judge in my case also due to the outright lies and fabrications of the police officers. In July 2012 I underwent my first jury trial. Despite the fact that officers blatantly lied and contradicted each other while testifying and that dozens of government employees with unimaginable resources collaborated to try and convict me, multiple jurors decided that I was not guilty after hearing all the evidence against me. The prosecutors decided that they would waste more of our tax money by retrying my case at the end of October 2012. The trial proceeded like that last one, with officers lying and even admitting to lying during the previous trial. Sadly, after two days of deliberating, the jurors reached the verdict of guilty. I suspect that some of the jurors were pressured into coming to a decision so they would not have to come back after the weekend. After the verdict was announced, I immediately entered into custody and was transferred to Glen Dyer County Jail in downtown Oakland. I have been here for 10 days and will likely be here for another two and half months, after which I will be transferred into to a federal prison for a 10-15 year sentence.  Here at jail, I am confined to a 100 sq. ft cell more than 21 hours a day with my cellmate, who is a mexican gangster from the mission. In our cell is a bunk-bed, a small desk, and a toilet. There is also a small slit of a window which lets in minimal light, but has a cloudy film on it so I can't see out of it. The cell is so small that there is only one spot where I can stand in the middle and stretch out my arms in all directions without hitting a wall. The cell walls and floor are filthy and there is limited access to cleaning supplies. In our ""pod"" there is a TV on very loud everyday beginning around 8am and ending by 11pm at the earliest but some days until 2am or later. The TV is usually on a sports channel or sometimes a violent movie and I can always hear it blaring into my cell often making it difficult to sleep. We are let out of the cell 4 times a day for meals and ""pod time"". Breakfast is served around 6 am (although sometimes as early as 4 am) and lunch is served around 3:30 pm. The ""meals"" consist of the most disgusting and unhealthy food I have ever eaten in my life. I was raised eating organic, vegetarian food my whole life. I have many food allergies and the jail is supposed to accommodate my special diet but have failed despite numerous written and verbal requests, so I am forced to go without or eat food that violates my fundamental health and spiritual beliefs. We are only given about 5-10 minutes to eat these ""meals"" and then forced to go back in our cells. ""Dinner"" is delivered to out doors around 7pm and 90% of the time its baloney sandwich, an orange and two cookies.  ""Pod time"" consists of all 26 inmates in our pod being let into the 1000 sq ft communal space where we play inmates play chess, cards, socialize, watch TV and get in line for short phone calls or showers. Pod time happens twice a day for a total of 3 hours or less, in the morning from around 8-10 am and in the evening around 8-9 pm. These times are often shortened and occasionally canceled. All the schedules are constantly shifting so its hard to get into a routine. Due to the noise and schedule its hard to get more than 4 hours of solid sleep. There are minimal educational and religious activities and most have a long wait list that takes a month or more. State law mandates that inmates get 3 hours/week of outdoor ""yard time"" but inmates here tell me they have had about 1 hour of yard time in the past 6 weeks! Indeed the jail violates many of its own operating procedures as well as state and federal regulations and probably international human rights codes.  I cry almost every day that I am here, although I am careful not to do it around other inmates. I miss all my family and friends. I miss being able to hug and cuddle with friends. I long to eat healthy food, breather fresh air, see the sun and the sky, be in nature and be able to move freely and get proper exercise. I pray everyday for a miraculous release but I don't see how its possible. I am using this experience as an oppurtunity to grow and learn as much as I can. I am doing lots of reading, writing lots of letters and doing calisthenics and yoga as much as I can in this cramped cell. I am cultivating a strong spiritual practice of meditation and prayer.  On January 17th, 2013 I will be sentenced to 10-15 years in federal prison. It would be great to see all my friends there, so mark your calendars if you can come. It would be great to have good character reference letters to present to my judge. My lawyer said that quality is much more important than quantity, so its best if they are from people that actually know me and especially good if they are from people who would be considered respectable by my conservative judge. The deadline for these is december 8th. Send them to Aaronzenstevens@gmail.com.  After sentencing it will take 5-30 days for me to be transferred to prison probably in Oregon or southern California. Prison is much better than jail and there are a lot more activities, free movement and outdoor time. I am trying to see it as an extended meditation retreat. Even though I have so many friends out there, I have a fear that I will be forgotten about, lost in the prison system.  Due to the fundamental flaws in my case, I will be attempting multiple appeals in the higher court. This will cost a lot more money, so my family and friends well be continuing to raise funds and they could use any assistance anyone could offer. If you have any media or journalism connections who might want to cover my story, please get in touch. Thank you for the tremendous amount of support and prayers, donations, and moral support I have received so far. It really touches my heart and makes this whole nightmare bearable. I urge everyone to do what they can to educate themselves and other about the cruel and corrupt criminal justice system, the horrors of the drug war and the prison industry. There is information on various organizations you can work with on TeaNotPrison.com. I also encourage people to explore concepts of judgement and punishment in our society.  Much Love and Gratitude! For The Benefit of All Human Beings, Oshan Anand ♥",♥

t5_2qmku,Astorial,1353627246,"&gt;The result is a shrinking supply of help, which has allowed the remaining nannies, maids and cooks to command wage increases at more than double the rate of inflation since 2006.  This is only a part of it.  Labor laws have been changing over the past years in concern of undocumented maids and diaristas which is forcing the employers to pay more.  For the most part, maids and diaristas are self-employed and are paid in cash, under the table.  This means their work book is not signed.  Many maids are now pushing to get their work books signed, and this is causing problems with their employers.  Many of the middle and upper class that would pay below the minimum wage and get away with it, but now the maids can push for their rights and have their work book signed.  Due to this, not only does the employer need to pay the federal minimum wage, but also all the other benefits (INSS, unemployment insurance, 13th salary, etc.).  This of course, raises the rates even higher.  I've also heard more than my share of horror stories from various maids and diaristas, both here in Brasil and also in Peru (had a full time maid there for 3 years...she told lots of horror stories).  The treatment that some of them receive from their employers is horrible, with the worst offenders usually being the ""new"" middle class.  ie:  burning hands/arms with clothes irons, beatings, verbal and psychological abuse, broken bones, etc.  Cool Story Bro™ time:  Back in Peru I met one of our maids friends, who also worked as a full time maid.  She had worked for a ""new"" middle class family (had just recently moved into the middle class rankings).  One night the family came home after a wedding party.  The wife had left a piece of wedding cake on the kitchen counter and went off to bed.  The maid started straightening up the house before going to bed and wrapped the cake with plastic wrap and put it in the fridge.  The following afternoon the wife went to eat her cake and found that the plastic wrap didn't fully seal, and the cake was dry due to air getting in.  She then decided to punish the maid for ruining her cake.  As the maid was in the utility room ironing, the wife came in, took the iron out of her hand, held her against the wall, and shoved the iron into her upper arm and chest which resulted in 2nd and 3rd degree burns (which left nasty scars).

t5_2qh7i,schuylercat,1353627665,"Hi 80's,  You know, I always felt the SpinClean fluid was bubbly and detergent-y, and that's why I always rinse with distilled water after I SpinClean. There are a lot of complaints from SpinClean users about spotting and degraded sound, which I would only assume would be from something icky being left on the record. All cleaning recipes add a surfactant, and that means a rinse after in my view.  I am assuming the Tergitol at .05% is about on par with whatever makes the bubbles in the SpinClean solution, but at the same time I think it might be getting a little too esoteric. Some discs I find in dollar bins, though, look perfect except a ton of dust and dirt, and that's where I'd go with the big stuff. The web site for Dow Chemical says the following:  ""Dow surfactants, such as TERGITOL™ nonionic surfactants, DOWFAX™ anionic surfactants and TRITON™ low foam surfactants, offer excellent surface tension reduction, wetting, detergency and soil removal, rinseability and a range of desirable foam properties in cleaning formulations.""  It's that rinseability that people are looking for, and that's why I heard people like this stuff.  And then again, it's probably a carcinogen...  Oh, and if the fluid goes bad in the fridge, maybe the beer is a workable solution? I mean, talk about scrubbing bubbles.",™

t5_2uqyi,GodOfAtheism,1353639637,"&gt;Why do you guys mock other reddit users for using words like ""le"" and ""gem""?   Because they are common tropes parroted by the **average redditor**™ continuously, and we have a disdain for the average redditor.  &gt;Most of the time these words are used in the more mainstream (I'm sure there's a better word) subreddits, which have a very high concentration of users that are still in High School, or are just generally more immature.  So we shouldn't expect people not to be dumb?  &gt;If you don't like the deterioration that's happening to those subreddits, then why don't you just unsubscribe?  Many of us already have!  &gt;Even after unsubscribing, however, I see people mocking the users of these words in other subreddits, like /r/AskReddit, and even smaller subreddits like /r/Dota2.  Okay, so?  &gt;I agree that there's some pretty severe circlejerk going on, but now you're pretty much guaranteed to get upvotes (as if they mattered) by mocking people. Most people have noticed this, and many of the ones who originally used the words are now mocking for some easy karma.  And thus the wheel turns.

t5_2ty95,metropolypse,1353648945,"Huh. Seems you are at a bit of an impasse! It looks like it won't be the end of the world if you don't respond. Remember that, even as you craft your response. Also remember: you get more than one bite at the apple; you don't have to say everything yet because if you're going to have a FacebookWar™ you're going to have a lot more chances to speak, so make sure you're setting yourself up well, and starting off on high ground.  So... what do you say? I suppose you can say that yes, sometimes in really dire situations like WWII/holocaust times we have to use war to protect peace--but even then, we have to ask forgiveness for that because being at war removes us from god [insert examples from scripture].   But I think a less complete (and admittedly, less radical) explanation might actually work just fine: Yes, when wolves advance on a flock of sheep, the shepherd must fight them off. But too often I think the people in power jump to this conclusion--they're so quick to say, ""yes! war is the answer here! now is one of those times when it is needed!"" That's not always the case; sometimes there are better options. War is a sticky thing because killing makes others want to kill you back. At some point, you can only achieve peace in one of two ways: 1) Kill all your enemies, their families, their friends, etc. or 2) Stop fighting. Jesus wanted us to go with the second option.  It's not a full-throated theological/ideological defense of the position, but it is a bit of a worldview-primer for folks. It also has the feature of not clearly looking for an argument. (i.e. It's theoretically possible that your buddy would look at that and say, ""okay, I see what you're saying. I still love me a good holy war."") It also has the feature of not making pronouncements that tell the person he's being judged--more like nudged in a more Christ-like direction. It doesn't go into all the hard-line peace theory stuff, but you can whip that out later if it turns into an argument.  Just my two cents! Hope you find it helpful. Good luck and please post results.",™

TacWedge™ is so aggressive that its spikes bite into these slick-as-ice surfaces and do not let go. Once TacWedge™ is firmly rammed home, it cannot be removed without destroying the device by either chopping or cutting off its Spike Foot to relieve the leaf spring tension built into the device.

t5_2qh16,JayKayAu,1353722828,"&gt; The idea that a government agency must approve all films is truly terrifying to me as an American.  I think this is a product of the rhetoric in your country. ""Freedom of speech"" is held up as though it were the pinnacle of everything, and we often hear you guys say things like ""I don't like what you're saying, but I'll defend to the death your right to say it.""  What freedom means is that you can do something without consequences. If there are consequences, you're no longer (perfectly) free to do that thing.  When people say ""I believe in free speech"", what they probably don't realise they're saying is ""I believe there should never be any sort of consequence for any type of speech, no matter what kind of speech it is"".  So even in the US, there are plenty of examples (which everyone accepts as a given) where speech has legal consequences:   - Slander/Defamation (e.g., someone calls you a rapist or something)  - Plagiarism (e.g., someone steals your work and pretends it's theirs)  - Lying in a courtroom (e.g., contempt of court)  - Lying in the course of business (e.g., this product is 100% mercury free)  - Lying about safety (e.g., safe for human consumption)  - etc, etc ...   If there's *absolute* freedom of speech, it means you have *no recourse* for any of those things - you can't do a thing about them, no matter how much you've been harmed.  When you guys wave the flag and say ""fuck yeah, freedom of speech"", we worry that you don't really understand the implications of that.  So, instead of thinking that freedom of speech is the Best Thing That's Ever Been Invented™, it's helpful to understand its limits. Once you understand its limits, then you can be sensible about applying them.  The film classification board in Australia is responsible for, well, classification. It's kinda handy to have things classified. They are able to ""refuse classification"" (RC) on a piece of media if they want, and it's only *very rarely* that anyone disagrees with them. That's because our classification system actually works. Btw, did I mention that our government actually works here? (It makes a difference.)  (On those rare occasions, we do the Aussie thing and gleefully break the law by setting up sneaky cinemas to show whatever it was.)  So, tl;dr - Your desire for absolute freedom of speech is a bit misguided, and the thing that terrifies you works beautifully here.",™

Fireworks is specifically made for pixel based designs to be displayed on a screen, especially web design and it allows you to effortlessly align things to be pixel perfect. It is also much more intuitive and easy to use than Photoshop when we're talking about web design and if give it a shot for a few days, I'd bet you can do pretty much everything you'd need to for a mock-up or full-blown design in half the time as in Photoshop and far more accurately.   It's kind of funny that many web designers have Fireworks in their toolbox because it came with their Adobe Creative Suite, but they never touch it because they're so used to Photoshop which is just an extremely bloated tool for web and interface design. I'll leave you with what adobe themselves say about each product:  &gt; Adobe® Fireworks® CS6 software helps you create beautiful designs for websites and mobile apps in a snap, without coding.

t5_2qwx3,Pharnaces_II,1353783462,"**Daily Deals:**  * Borderlands 2  Wow, we're really seeing a lot of big name 4x games drop a lot this sale! A safe assumption is that if you liked or didn't like Borderlands 1 you will have the same opinion of Borderlands 2. The shooting has marginally improved and quests no longer feel like they were copied from a semi-futuristic World of Warcraft, but the gunplay is still heavily rooted in its RPG design and doesn't feel quite like a proper shooter. There's a ton of loot and quest variety right now and the huge price drop may justify picking it up right now, but there is a lot of DLC on the horizon for Borderlands 2 so you may be better served waiting until next year's summer sale for a GOTY edition.  I've said it before and I'll say it again: the gunplay in Borderlands is bad. Four simultaneously firing RPG rockets to the chest should not slowly chip away at an enemy's HP just because he is 2 levels higher than me. There's a really terrible power curve in both games where anything below your level dies instantly, anything at your level is reasonable, and anything above you in literally an HP machine surrounded by 15 feet of solid steel.  Also if you have a problem with meme spouting you're going to hate the humor of BL2.  Experience: Played solo for 10 hours, co-op for 15. Got bored and dropped.  Recommendation: If you liked the original buy, if not don't. Might want to wait for a GOTY edition either way.  * Deus Ex Human Revolution   I must admit, the first time I played Human Revolution I hated it. The gunplay isn't the greatest, the inventory is a nightmare straight out of the mid 90s, and everyone looks like they were carved out of a rectangular block of marble. I recently gave it and the whole series another playthrough and my feelings on it changes significantly. It offers the perfect balance between Deus Ex style limited freedom in large levels and Deus Ex: Invisible War style ""play anyway you want"" gameplay. With the exception of 3 NPCs you do not have to kill anyone, stealth is heavily rewarded, and there are a great variety of augmentations to upgrade. The story is laced with symbolism connected to Icarus and there is a lot of side content to discover in the world which rewards the explorer.  The main issue with HR is that it tells you that you can play however you want, then punishes you for going rambo. It has the Dishonored problem of the developers giving players freedom, but trying to force their ideas of *how* the player should play upon them. In my combat playthrough I barely got 70% of the upgrades, in the other two I pretty much got every upgrade.  Also the lack of full energy regeneration in stupid and breaks immersion. How come my HP regens but in order to power up muh stealth drive I need to eat some Doritos™ and Mountain Dew™ (yes there is in game advertising).  Get The Missing Link DLC as it is required to understand what the fuck happens in the ending.  Experience: 3 playthroughs, 2 stealth and one mixed combat and stealth, totaling about 40-50 hours of gameplay. Missing Link completed once, didn't really like that it took away all your upgrades from the main game.  Recommendation: Buy! This is a can't miss game in an amazing series.  * Chivalry Medieval Warfare  The other of the two sword'n'board fighting games released this year, along with War of the Roses. Chivalry has effectively won the competition and is the game with the larger, more active playerbase. Fighting uses 3 melee attacks, feinting, block, dodging, kicking, and a variety of ranged weapons. There are not very many maps, unfortunately, but more content will be added and the game just received its first major patch.  My main issue with Chivalry is that it feels like a mod. Performance is terrible, there's no way to disable the resource intensive MLAA, some maps are literally unplayable on the lowest settings while others get 120+fps on the highest. Animations aren't the best and having a low latency is an absolute must for high level play. Unlike a shooter anything about 50ms is going to harm your play a lot. However, the success of the game guarantees that these issues will be fixed with time and the devs have stated on the forums that they are working on them as quickly as possible.  Another problem is longevity. Why should you keep playing this game? If you do well you can unlock all the weapons for a class in a few hours, especially in TDM, and the serious lack of maps and game modes besides CTF and TDM equivalents gets boring fast.  Note: I highly recommend at least a 3 button (not counting middle mouse button) mouse to play this game. By default it uses scrolling for two of the three attack types and I found that it just didn't work very well. When I rebound them to my other mouse buttons the game became much more fun.  Experience: 7 hours post-release, 6 pre-release.  Recommendation: Lukewarm buy. You may want to hold off until they release some more content, unless you don't mind playing on the same 5 or so maps over and over.  * Total War: Shogun 2  Luckily Creative Assembly managed to pull their heads out of their asses after Empire and Napoleon and made a good game. The pathfinding issues are fixed, the graphics improved, the performance improved, and the gameplay is fun again. There's not much else to say, really, if you liked Total War before you'll like it again now, though that may heavily depend on your interest in Japanese history.  Experience: 40 hours or so, half in a campaign and half in custom battles. No multiplayer.  Recommendation: If you like 4x strategy where you control the battles TW:S2 is a perfect fit for you, unless you don't like Japanese history. If that is the case then pick up Medieval 2 and its expansion.  * Mark of the Ninja  I haven't personally played this game but everyone everywhere has basically said it's the stealth game of the year, if not the best stealth game since Thief 2.   Recommendation: None  **Flash sales:**  * Call of Duty: Black Ops  Oh Activision is giving us the two version old COD for 50% off, how sweet of them! Sarcasm aside Black Ops was probably my favorite Call of Duty because Treyarch finally realized what Infinity Ward did not, that the game is the most fun when you're frantically running around solo getting kills. All of the maps are designed around this principle and while most of them aren't very memorable it produced the best map in COD history: Nuketown. Gameplay is typical COD, slightly more refined than its predecessor, with a gun game knock-off and non-linear progression in the form of purchasing perks and weapons with currency earned from playing the game. It's much nicer than the linear grind of earlier games in the series.  The campaign was surprisingly good, for a Call of Duty game. I can't say much about it without giving some spoilers but I will say that it has a few missions which are almost as good as the Stalingrad mission from Call of Duty 2.  Like all post Modern Warfare Call of Duty games it retains a dedicated fanbase who hate change (in the case of Modern Warfare 3 they are pretty justified as that was a terrible game and a terrible port) with 4000~ people online at all times. It's really easy to find a full or nearly full stock map server.   Experience: 12 hours singleplayer, 31 hours multiplayer. &lt;2 hours in Zombie mode. Reached rank 35-45 IIRC.  Recommendation: Pass. 3 year old game with a stale community for 50% off is a bad deal.  * Warhammer 40k: Dawn of War II Complete Pack  There's really not a lot to be said about this pack. Do you like RTS? Do you like the Warhammer 40k series? If you answered yes and yes pick up the pack, as these are the best video games in the series. I believe that all of the campaigns in Dawn of War II are co-opable, which is a really nice feature for a strategy game. Being a fan of the series isn't really required but it is obviously much nicer if you know at least some of the lore of Warhammer 40,000.  Experience: 15 hours singleplayer, 5 hours multiplayer.  Recommendation: Buy if you like Warhammer 40k and RTS, if not look elsewhere.   * Carrier Command  Avoid this garbage. The game has 4 major problems:  1. Bad pathfinding (in an RTS!!!)  2. Minimal manual unit selection (in an RTS?!?!?!)  3. Buggy as hell  4. AI is broken  The entire front page of the forums are people complaining about the game being a broken, unplayable mess. You're better off with the Amiga original or 10 McDonalds hamburgers, whichever sounds more appealing.  Experience: 0 hours pirated version, wouldn't start and was promptly deleted.  Recommendation: Pass  * Mass Effect 1 and 2  Though the series became extremely controversial with its third installment the first two games are almost universally loved by RPG fans and ""normal"" gamers alike. Mass Effect 1 is closer to an RPG and Mass Effect 2 is closer to a third person shooter with RPG elements. Great story, great characters, awesome voice work, above average writing, and a stellar soundtrack by Jack Wall combine to make these two games some of the most iconic games of all time and a worthy addition to anyone's library.  The DLC for ME2, with the exception of items and cosmetics, should be purchased as it all relates to the story. Lair of the Shadow Broker is agreed to be the best.  Experience: 100+ hours on the 360 and PC versions of Mass Effect 1, 100+ hours on the PC version of Mass Effect 2. Completed all quests in both games at least once.  Recommendation: Buy it! $12 for at *least* 60 hours of quality gameplay is a fantastic deal.",™

Just think, the guy making an ass out of himself just completely destroyed your pitiful attempt at being contrarian... How embarrassing for you. I'm giving Faber his due respect, you're just confused as to how much he actually deserves and what he has actually done for the sport. This isn't even a new subject, people have been talking about Faber's career and record for years now. Faber IS a gatekeeper, his entire purpose since being obliterated by MTB has been to sell PPVs and make other fighters look good... So I do give him respect for that, he's certainly made both Jose Aldo and Dominick Cruz look good in his losses to them.  &gt;If you want to argue that top guys are gatekeepers, by all means do so.

This is just amazing, you have no idea how much I'm reveling in your display of ignorance. Faber WAS a top talent, but since getting punched and kicked out of the division he used to call ""HIS"" weightclass... How can you even attempt to think he's been anything other than a name used to sell PPVs? It clearly isn't because of the fights he has won since losing his title, because as I've already pointed out he's gone 5-5-0.  I think maybe you need to suck it up and deal with the fact that his best years are behind him, and injuring his hands every time he fights isn't doing anything to make him a contender. The reality of the situation is that he was given chances at the title that he didn't deserve, causing other guys to wait in line or entirely miss their shot.",™

Floating down on a bed made of bald eagles, Coke cans, double quarter BigMcWhooperJrs and democracy™, the sound barrier erupts with a thunderous release of glorious noise.

All violence is forever ended in the region as all conflicts, regardless of origin, cause or need, are solved with PARTY. The Middle East soon becomes the sole producer, exporter and monopolizer of PARTY. The West quickly accepts that the power of PARTY is the future and the world is soon forever changed by the power of PARTY.

An example would be one of my last games, where I played China. I REALLY didn't like Russia encroaching on my borders, so I waited for the current Great War (which they were in) to end. Russia lost and had to capitulate, which dropped them out of Great Power status. So what did I do then?   I gave them some free factories using foreign investment.  Not just any factories. Oh no. I gave them Canned Food factories. One of the worst you can build. And I didn't build one or two, I built them in ALL their regions. The resulting influx of canned food in the world market and the number of people moving from their farms and mines to man the worthless factories meant that within a few years Russia was completely and utterly bankrupt.  And then I gave them more canned food factories.  *Canned Food: For when you absolutely, positively hate someone.*®",®

t5_2qi63,torSoundsGoodPodcast,1353867430,from their [fb group](https://www.facebook.com/events/495212660513613/):  &gt;As someone who struggles with impulsive and compulsive buying I found this event very therapeutic. I find more often than not the things I buy I don't even really want. I have read many studies and articles that discuss the issue of shopping as a common way women releive stress. For me i shop when i feel stress but i always feel stressed after for wasting money and having a negative impact on the planet. To walk into a mall and not buy something and attain a sense of peace and relaxation is a great way to form now neuronal pathways that will help me over come my compulsion. Thank you. ♥,♥

t5_2qnvz,NeoDestiny,1353871152,"&gt;Yes, they do. Moreover, sometimes developers release new drivers specifically for a new game, because it just doesn't work with previous drivers.  Haven't seen any patch notes or anything recently from Nvidia or anything else about it. I've had driver problems before in games and generally it leads to really shitty performance or things not rendering correctly. Never in my life will it just ""crash"" in the loading screen.  &gt;Only 6-7 months? Yeah, should be ok, lol.  You think drivers are released every week for graphics cards? It's like 1-2 months between version updates.  &gt;If it can be done with the CPU, it doesn't mean that you don't need the sofware for it, mang.  I need to update my graphics card drivers...for the software...to do physics calculations on my CPU...? wut?  And again, not related to crashing problems.  &gt;I don't think that, I know it.  Did you even read what you linked? Most of those were people who had already loaded a game and who were having conflicts with other programs on their boxes.  You seriously just sit and stare at your apps loading because you're too scared to alt tab out? Jesus, it feels like 2000 all over again.  &gt;I'm just trying to help, dude.

I'm not a lawyer, but just from the few minutes I've spent on the site, I've found a way to fudge a wage reported at ~$38/hour to ~$18/hour.  Granted, if you were under extreme scrutiny, it might be harder to switch between wage level 1/2, but considering how many entry level positions require 2-3 years prior experience and that the O*Net™ JobZone is at 4 (which means that it is expected to require a few years experience just to get into the job), and considering the wide array of job duties, it wouldn't be that difficult to switch a wage level 2 job from a higher paid OES/SOC Title into a wage level 1 job from a lower paid OES/SOC Title.  I'm sure there are lawyers that can detail the exact job duties needed to do this on the level needed to pass normal scrutiny.  So yeah, it appears it can be manipulated.  Not from $50/hour to $8/hour, but you can manipulate at least $10/hour in computer related work (at least in the local where I work).

The concept of corporations is a socialist invention, thanks for playing.

Thanks ♡♡♡ Slumgullion seems to be exactly the word I've been missing, to put a name for all reality weirding going on in this game some crazy people denote ""reality""❢  -----  PS. Sorry, I misunderstood the word slumgullion, the site as such seem to be part of that weirding module. What I had read was the brief [from a search](http://www.bing.com/search?q=slumgullion)  *Slumgullion things...too good to take down and have disappear!*  That was what I thought slumgullion meant, as most good things have disappeared, and most good things are cancelled, and most good things are fighted by some maffia controlling the US marionette government which then spreads their viral ideas over the globe, thus infecting it.  However, also good things come from US, like Richard Stallman and Free Software Foundation, and Internet, despite it's a DARPA invention, and Richard Feynmann, Wikipedia, Michael Jackson, Multics, Unix, Foresight Institute, MIT free educational program etc.  PPS. maybe I should mention also software patents, as without this damned crazy US invention, then I would probably not have come up with the idea to the patent killing patent, which I got during a debate with a software patent freak, Gregory Aharonian, a patent buster, in San Francisco 2000. This is what I patent applied in US 2004, with the intention to kill the patent system. ",❣

[Yes.](http://blog.blacktieguide.com/2012/09/11/brooks-brothers-fall-2012-catalogue/) In fact I have a copy sitting right next to me at this moment.  [Here's Spring 2012](http://www.brooksbrothers.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-brooksbrothers-Site/default/OnlineCatalog-Show?cid=PRE_SPRING2012&amp;cname=PRE_SPRING2012&amp;catsize=713)  &gt; ... but even there you see everyone from a young boy to a guy with a receding hairline to a man with grey hair and beard.

Whereas the latter is limited to straight product photography against white seamless. (Also: [little in the way of child models online](http://www.brooksbrothers.com/Kids/kids,default,sc.html).)  So, two different *types* of photography and content for two different purposes. But all in service of the same, thoroughly consistent brand program.  Which makes sense, because the brand is paramount and a brand is for shit without some level of consistency.  **TL;DR:** No.",®

t5_2qzzs,Butthole_Scientist,1353935442,"I know that.   Your body makes all of the sodium bicarbonate it needs just from burning sugar. The end product of metabolising carbohydrates is basically CO2 + H20. CO2  and H2O is converted to H2Co3, which dissasociates to H+ and HCO3, Bicarbonate.  (CO2 + H2O ↔ H2CO3 ↔ H+ + HCO3)  Eating sodium bicarbonate in small amounts has no effect on overall blood pH because your body wants to maintain homeostasis, so it secretes more HCl to balance out the base that you added.  If you were to take enough sodium bicarb to make a difference in blood pH readings, then you are going to likely die from metabolic alkalosis.   I'm a paramedic. I know what I'm talking about.",↔

Neither, actually. The word 'LEGO', when used as a noun, should only refer to the company that makes the product. Otherwise 'LEGO' is supposed to be used as an adjective. Thus, when referring to the pieces, neither 'lego' nor 'legos' is correct... rather one should say: 'LEGO bricks' or 'LEGO pieces' or whatever (using LEGO as an adjective -- and one should really capitalize all of the letters, and put the little 'circle-R' symbol after it (®)).

This is Aristotle's brief definition from my Encyclopedia:    *Aristotle described politics as a society's common strive towards ""a good life"" and solve conflicts between the common good and special interests.*  Here some more elaborate, although more fuzzy definition. It would be enough with [Aristoteles defintion](http://www1.union.edu/wareht/gkcultur/guide/18/aristotle.html).  *Politics as defined by Aristotle himself is a ""practical science"" because it deals with making citizens happy. His philosophy is to find the supreme purpose of life, virtue as he puts it. One of the most important roles of a politician, though, is to make laws, or constitutions. With this task I believe that Aristotle wanted the citizens well being and livelihood to be contemplated before any laws were made permanent. After the laws are put into place the politician's job is to make sure that that they are abided by. Aristotle believes that with the same constitution citizens will be the same over time, but if the constitution is ever changed so will the citizen.*  --------------------  Unfortunately politics today is some obscure art in lying, deceiving, exercise  power and earn a lot without doing anything meaningful.... :(  Nothing that I would never ever my kids to learn, fortunately they didn't❣  They are both very nice, helpful honest persons (29 and 32 years).",❣

First, find some [5/8"" SAE flat washers](http://www.engineering.com/Library/ArticlesPage/tabid/85/ArticleID/118/Washer-Size-Chart.aspx). They're pretty cheap from a hardware store, and you only need 5-10 of them depending on the length of your average turd. These will be the baffles.  Once this is done, you need to buy a piece of [1-5/16"" OD tube](http://www.speedymetals.com/showproduct.aspx?productid=3457) and cut it into 3/8"" pieces. These will be the spacers.  Next, you need to get 12"" of [1-5/16 ID pipe](http://www.onlinemetals.com/merchant.cfm?pid=7562&amp;step=4&amp;showunits=inches&amp;id=283&amp;top_cat=0) (you can cut it down to fit later). This will be the sheath that holds everything together.  To assemble the device, first weld a washer to one of the open ends of your sheath. Then, alternately layer your 3/8"" pieces of tubing and your washers. To cap off your creation, set your final washer in place, cut the sheath flush with this final washer, and weld it in place. Finally, be sure to grind down your welds and deburr everything. You want a silky smooth exterior of your device.   Congratulations, you have finished creating your Shit Silencer™. Simply insert into your rectum and enjoy your effortless shits, silent farts, and greatly reduced cleanup. ",™

t5_2qh13,fairwellIMJA,1353977914,"&gt;like it's a guarantee.    Don't tell anybody, but...    The real number is ""35%"" were intercepted. http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2012/11/19/israel-has-not-yet-faced-true-missile-test Let's also keep in mind that an Iron dome battery has at most 16 missiles.   Russia is cool, but Iran has effectively become Russian interests protector in the middle east. (Anti- petrodollar) And Iran has pursued one primary method of self defense for the past 30 years, the guided missile. (goggle ""iran missile superpower"".) And this is a nice vid &amp; story of how the US Navy is defenseless, and Iran turned a Chinese ""Volkswagen"" missile into an Iranian  ""Porsche"" supper-missile:   ""An interview with Joe Trento about C-802 missiles and what they mean for the Persian Gulf"". http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=kuFitD8ZbWA [11:56] &amp; http://www.dcbureau.org/category/national-security-news-service/page/7   Please read this:  &gt;The rocket-nozzle control system allows the missile to change its trajectory several times during re-entry and even terminal phase, effectively preventing interceptor guidance via trajectory prediction by early warning radar - a method nearly all long range ABM systems use. As a high-speed ballistic missile and pre-mission fueling capability, the Shahab-3 has an extremely short launch/impact time ratio. This means that the INS/gyroscope guidance would also remain relatively accurate until impact (important, given the fact that the gyroscopes tend to lose accuracy with longer flights). The CEP is estimated to be at 30–50 metres (98–160 ft) or less   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shahab-3   &amp;  See [this pic](http://defense-update.com/Images_new3/noor_c802.jpg)  of an ordinary small delivery truck (6 wheeler) launching an Iranian weapon (Range: 360 km) that would immediately cause Israel to beg for mercy if aimed at any one of these 6 places http://www.digitaljournal.com/img/4/9/8/8/0/7/i/7/8/9/o/Israels_known_nuclear_sites.JPG  When Iran decides to arm Hamas... You'll know! ---    Remember that drone that flew over Israel for three hours and was only discovered when it was over Demona???  ... and when the US drone crossed into Iranian airspace, the Iranians were on it like stink on shit?   See:   &gt;Iranian passive radar. Passive radars do not transmit waves and instead, detect and track objects by processing reflections from non-cooperative sources of illumination in the environment, such as commercial broadcast and communications signals.       &gt;Alim **is cheaper** and has less maintenance cost than normal radars because it doesn't have transmitter and movable mechanical parts. Although it needs high processing power because it has to do six levels of processing to track a target. Other advantages include the ability to detect low RCS (""stealth"") targets in low altitudes. Also as it doesn't transmit anything, it is not possible to destroy it using anti radiation missiles such as American AGM-88 HARM thus it can be deployed near the enemy lines.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alim_radar_system   Israel can drop every Nuke they own on Iran, and Iran will still survive, however, Israel will not... *(And Israel knows it, otherwise they would have attacked already.)*    PS: Just ask and I'll tell you how *(it's possible)* Iran will make the first wave of Missiles sent against it, hit US bases and Saudi royal family locations instead! *([the same way it took down that drone](http://www.ne.anl.gov/capabilities/vat/spoof.html), but on missiles to bring them all the way to Riyadh!)* ☺   ",☺

t5_2qwx3,Ultravod,1353989417,"The original [Red Faction](http://store.steampowered.com/app/20530/) is a classic PC FPS, in the best sense of the term.  It's got great gunplay, a decent story, and the ancient GeoMod engine it uses has held up pretty well.  Recommended.  [Red Faction II](http://store.steampowered.com/app/20550/), OTOH, is a completely consolized piece of SHIT that made me want to smash an X-Box.  I stubbornly beat the whole game, and hated every minute of it.  The sad thing is, it's possible to see the good game in there that wants to get out.  Most of the art assets are very good, and the voice acting is okay.  The problems are the hokey level design, over-reliance on rail shooter sequences, laughably bad character models, and a complete lack of a real savegame system.  While the first Red Faction is a true classic PC FPS, the sequel lives up to every insult that PC gamers like to hurl at console shooters.  It's a thinly-disguised blessing that the main campaign is only 6 hours.  [Red Faction Guerilla](http://store.steampowered.com/app/20500/) quite different in that it's a 3rd persons shooter.  I have not played it, but people whose opinions I value have said good things about it.  [Red Faction Armageddon](http://store.steampowered.com/app/55110/) was marketed terribly and a complete flop commercially.  It's not as good as the original, but at this price it is definitely worth it.  I have not played the DLC.  If by some miracle you don't already own [The Binding of Isaac](http://store.steampowered.com/app/113200/) then this is your chance to cough up $1.25.

t5_2qh3v,gizzomizzo,1353989706,"Lol, I knew someone would grab the sentence and Educate ™ me. It was a joke, lighten up.   What exactly do you think I mean when I'm talking about ""hard"" and ""soft"" people? Some 80s movie caricatures, tough jocks looking down on frail nerds?   Life is hard. The world is scary and dangerous and everything can kill you. If you're ""soft"", you're the type of person that allows the lowest common primal denominator (fear) to control your brief time on Earth. Thick skin makes you a better person; in that queue analogy, it's not about controlling people with fear and violence, it's controlling your boundaries of respect with something universal that speaks to the basest aspect of human nature.  I don't want my daughter scared to walk home alone because she could get raped; I want her to have mace, brazilian jiu jitsu skills, ancient magic and a group of similarly armed friends because danger shouldn't dictate how you experience this wonderful world we live in; in that same way, I don't want my children to grow up ""soft"", thinking it's all love and respect and mutual understanding and empathy and good will because human nature dictates that there is always someone who makes the wrong decision, someone who wants to hurt your feelings, and they should be prepared; not impervious, just enduring.   “It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood, who strives valiantly; who errs and comes short again and again; because there is not effort without error and shortcomings; but who does actually strive to do the deed; who knows the great enthusiasm, the great devotion, who spends himself in a worthy cause, who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement and who at the worst, if he fails, at least he fails while daring greatly. So that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat.” ",™

t5_2qhk3,BioGenx2b,1354028691,"    Men need feminism.     Feminism is for everyone.  or      Women need Men's Rights.     Men's Rights is for everyone.  __________________ Both of the above statements are fine and indeed true. As for the images you linked...  1. Though I can see that the concept of patriarchy in Western society can be easily assumed, it should be scrutinized heavily. It certainly does exist in certain subcultures here in the West, but it absolutely exists as a state-sponsored institution in many parts of the world, and in that context it makes perfect sense.   As for the last statement, I see absolutely nothing wrong with that. Our history of patriarchy prior to the feminist movement's victories continued the trend of male disposability, something of which our culture is still feeling the effects.  2. `This is sarcasm.` How could you not see that? Maybe you missed the thread from a couple of weeks ago.  3. (*Feminism* **↔ Men's Rights**) is not only for (*women* **↔ men**), but also for (*men* **↔ women**) with (*female* **↔ male**) siblings, parents, children, cousins, and friends.  4. Aside from the assertion of present-day Western patriarchy, the entry spends its time giving credit to feminism for its role in combating traditional gender roles, something for which we all suffer, men and women alike.  5. ""There are certainly women calling themselves feminists who believe that women should be elevated to a higher social level than men, however; this is hardly the case with the majority of feminists.""   _________________   ""Thinking of feminism within the context of eliminating the gender binary opens up a whole new set of solutions to feminist problems. For example, the professional math world is overwhelmingly male dominated. Instead of ensuring that 50% of people hired in mathematics are women, we can instead work to eliminate the prejudice that women are inferior at math than men that starts as early as elementary school. It is more important to judge a person’s skills by a person-to-person basis. Gender should not be a factor when hiring for a job in any field. Equality means equal opportunity, not monotony.""  6. `(Duplicate of 5.) `  Seriously though, did you even read these articles? You're definitely straw manning this. Your arguments don't even match up with your supporting evidence. In fact, all you've done was support what I've been saying. *Unless that was your whole plan all along...?*  `You sly bastard.`",↔

A current route is denied the network operators. By Daniel Bakir Netzentwicklungsplan, Stromtrassen, Stromleitungen, Stromautobahn, Energiewende  &gt;2800 km additional lines: three new electricity highways to transport energy from the north to the south.  &gt;© Philip Moeller / stern.de Send Print Google-Anzeige Nexus 7 from Google Thin, light, and more portable with mobile data. Shop now from $199. play.google.com  &gt;A n wind is not lacking in the German coast. And wind turbines are in the far north, more than some is right. What is missing are the lines that carry the electricity generated in the south. At this site, the federal government has now taken a step. The Federal Network Agency on Monday handed Economy Minister Philipp Rösler (FDP), the final network development plan - the national master plan for the expansion of power lines. Anzeige  &gt;Central are mainly the three planned high-voltage direct current transmission lines (HVDC). You have to transport large quantities of electricity over hundreds of kilometers from north to south, which is why they are also called power highways. The western route is from the North of the Ruhr to the Rhine-Main area. The average north-south connection begins and ends in the Hamburg area east of Stuttgart. The third line links Thuringia and Bavaria. The originally planned fourth current highway from near Bielefeld in the greater Frankfurt area will initially not be built. 1000 km less than planned  &gt;Overall, in the next ten years, new energy highways are created with a length of 2800 kilometers. This is around 1000 km less than originally planned. In addition, only 2800 km further - instead of originally planned 4400 km - reinforced the existing high voltage grid. Of the 74 individual measures that network operators had suggested confirmed the network provider only 51st The cost is estimated at 20 billion euros. Economy Minister Philipp Rösler called it a ""milestone in the transformation of energy supply.""  &gt;The network development plan is the result of a complex process, which was launched in the summer of last year and also affected citizens and citizens' groups acknowledged the opportunity to have their say. A first draft of the transmission system operators had submitted in August. In its review of 3300 submissions were incorporated, the president of the network provider, Jochen Homann. Most were submitted by citizens. What's next?  &gt;Now the ball is in the Federal Ministry of Economics, which has cast the plan into law. Federal law required the necessary plan to be adopted in December by the Cabinet, the parliamentary process can begin. With the law will define the start and end points of the future high-voltage lines. Only then is the route corridors are defined. That's up to a thousand meters wide strip where the wires are to be later. Extend the electricity highways by several states, the responsibility lies with the future of the network provider. The goal is to shorten the usual procedure for such major projects duration of ten years and more clearly. ",©

I think everyone can improve on something and that's part of the reason I posted, and I ended up getting suggestions that I do take to heart and will work on.  It was never my intention to make others feel worse about themselves, god knows how many people did that to me growing up.   I'm not here for compliments. The thing is, I spent years growing up in middle school and high school as a really really unattractive kid and got picked on for it constantly. Most kids looked forward to Saturday and Sunday to sleep in; I saw them as respites from the dirty looks and teasing. Because of that my own view is often distorted. I literally have no idea if I am attractive. You see, the braces came off, I got contacts, seriously changed how I dressed and put a little effort into my hair and face, but that ugly kid greets me every time I look in a mirror.   There's a saying to be content, but never satisfied and I try to follow that. There's nothing wrong with self improvement. And good god, if I had placed all my value in my looks all those years I was bullied, I don't think I would have made it. Instead, I poured myself into studying and working my ass off to make sure that I wouldn't  have to rely on looks to get by because back then that was the furthest thing from an option that I had.  And these jobs are just part time until I finish school 😊. ",😊

Whenever questions like this come up, though, I'm just reminded of back when people were demanding flying mounts in Azeroth.

t5_2qxyy,kmeisthax,1354040501,"Since this will be DMCA'd in five seconds:  &gt;I bought a digital video download today that required a video player from Leaping Brain. As usual, the proprietary player wasn't great and to transfer it to my iPhone I'd need another proprietary player. Ugh. But I browsed around and found that the video had been downloaded into a hidden directory as a bunch of .mov files. Great, except none of the files would play.  &gt;It turned out the actual player, launched from their compiled app, was a Python wrapper around some VLC libraries. Nothing funny going on, as far as I could tell, but when I tried to launch the player directly, nothing happened. The compiled app was modifying the .mov files right before they were loaded into the player, and then reverting the file on disk. According to http://leapingbrain.com/mod-machine/faq/:  &gt;&gt; ""We apply our BrainTrust™ proprietary video encryption to your movies before we upload them to our servers. If someone ever was able to gain access to your content, the files would be useless and unplayable, because they are stored in a scrambled, encrypted format. Once downloaded to the user’s hard drive, the files are still encrypted and only readable via the MOD Machine Player by a legitimate owner. We are not aware of a better DRM scheme than ours. Where Windows Media DRM is easily crackable, and doesn’t run on Macs, BrainTrust™ works great on Windows 8, Vista, Windows XP and Mac, and is virtually uncrackable.""  &gt;Virtually uncrackable? Well, since they load the file from a Python script, it's easy to make a copy of the ""decrypted"" file before it's reverted. Having done so, I was curious to see the encryption scheme. By comparing the binary files, I discovered the ""proprietary video encryption"" algorithm: for the first 15kB, each 1kB block has its initial bytes xor'd with the string ""RANDOM_STRING"". That's the ""scrambled, encrypted format"" that leaves these files ""useless and unplayable"".",™

t5_2qn3i,srmatto,1354050444,I'm not kittiesaysmeow. I prefer Denver to Boulder (but live in Boulder currently) because it feels more 'grown up' than Boulder. If you asked me to qualify that the best I could do is that Boulder feels like a permanent Frat Party everywhere at night now and it is no longer contained to just 'The Hill' it is now on Pearl St. as well. I feel like Denver is more sophisticated *and* more fun. There's a more diverse array of things to enjoy in Denver and you'll have more money to enjoy them. There's a more diverse crowd in Denver as well.  Boulder feels like Frat Boys v. et al. They wanna 'shake up' the norms and 'put people on edge'!™ In reality they just get in the way of a good beer and company most of the time. In Denver it feels like us kids are taking a genuine crack at being a bit more humane and personable.,™

t5_2qh1e,vaikekiisu,1354052849,"&gt; A person who considers suicide as a valuable option is thus thinking rationally.  This is extremely questionable as a statement and as an application of rational thought.  You do not know what you are talking about. If your hypothetical unemployed, bereaved alcoholic walks up to you and says ""I'm feeling suicidal,"" and you sit him down and tell him that actually he's a perfect example of when suicidal feelings are rational, your pedantic Logic and Reason™ circlejerking *could literally cause that person to end their life.*  If you're okay with that, fine. You value hamfisted applications of ""rationality"" over human life, and that is, as you say, your *opinion.* But don't spew it all over the Internet where suicidal people could see it and be hurt by it.  You do not understand what it is like to be suicidal, and how suicidal people will interpret your ivory tower attempts to explain their Rational Options to them. I do, because I have been.

t5_2qknj,IronEngineer,1354096574,"The whole name fiasco is going to be settled in court at a level of trademark law that is beyond what either of us can say anything about.  That whole smARtDUINO thing they have going though is really toeing that line so it really could go either way on that point.  I'm just not willing to say Arduino is being the bad guy on that point as that really is getting close to the core of the whole if you don't defend your trademark you lose it part of the law.  If you create a business called Playstation machines, modding playstations in some sort of open source manner, Sony would have to sue you or they could lose their trademark on the term playstation.  Lets put that aside and leave it to the courts, as that is where it will likely go.  I think the statements being challenged are these:   ""For years we manufactured the ARDUINO in Italy. Now we created a new Open System: modular, scalable, the world's cheapest and smallest! ""  ""We started our company over 15 years ago in the north of Italy, in a very small town. Our company used to be a contractor for the manufacturing of Arduino™ and, a couple of years ago, some important staff left the factory that manufactured the Arduino™ to join us. With this transition we gain a lot of experience in this field.""  Now these claims are made on their kickstarter page.  The issue being made about them rises from the Italian manufacturing company that made Arduinos.  They seem to be saying this company never worked for them at all.  Not even as subcontractors if I read it correctly.  2 of the employees did work for a subcontractor at one point, but they quit that job.  It seems to be largely a problem with translation errors abounding as the author of the kickstarter page, Dimitri, does not speak English at an extremely high level, and has been arguing that saying your company used to be the contractor for manufacturing Arduinos is the same as having employees who used to work for a subcontractor of this company at some time in the past.  Read this article for some interesting insight  http://hackerbee.com/2012/11/27/smartduino-has-pr-problems/  There are many more articles at other locations reporting similar information at this point.  It seems Dimitri was trying to do his own PR on this issue and was jumping all around the internet to many sites badmouthing Arduino.  Mossimo already stated apparently that he isn't going to sue over the work claims at least, but Dimitri also posted an image of his product that had the label Arduino screen printed on it, a massive trademark violation.   I would pose that he is a a guy trying to start up a cool product, but who doesn't speak English well enough to understand subtle differences in wordings and also doesn't full understand the law involved here.  I'll try to find that image with Arduino screen printed on their product, but if they go to market with that they are going to face some real problems in the near future.  This might be the picture they are referring to but am unsure:  https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/219/985/d8d0152d411cc00baa2ec20dc18367ce_large.jpg?1350833296  They are here selling a bard as the SmARtHOST Arduino.

t5_2sjmv,lobsterbreakfast,1354099624,"A lot of the comments here are pretty balanced and it's keeping my hopes up for the Vita, but I will tell you a sad sad tale.  Many, many years ago, Sega produced an awesome console called the Dreamcast®.  Not only was it innovative with 56k ports to put it online accompanied with an internet gaming lobby, but it also had a lot of pretty decent titles, and some AWESOME ones including Skies of Arcadia, which is still underrated to this day.    The Dreamcast® had decent sales at first, but dropped off due to competition from the PS2.  Its problems were further compounded by expensive additional hardware (*cough* memory card *cough*), as well as lack of third-party support because the big developers realized there was money to be made elsewhere.  Eventually, only after a shelf-life of about 2 years, a debt-ridden Sega stopped manufacturing Dreamcast® and all was lost.    **TL;DR  SONY LEARN YOUR LESSON FROM THE DREAMCAST. ILY**  edit: just realized how ironic this was",®

t5_2tkk1,Blast-Hardcheese,1354102189,"Like a lot of people I do try to mix things up a little bit and I generally change what character I use every few games. Currently I've got a few characters that I seem to default to:  * Lightbringer the Paladin  * Pathogen the Vorcha Sentinel * BobJohnson the Salarian Infiltrator * SlaughterMelon the Krogan Mudertrain™ * Blinky the Turian Ghost * GethByChocolate the Geth Trooper   As for my favorite, it's hard to say. I'm rather fond of the paladin, especially on a small map such as Glacier. Snap Freeze really is an awesome ability that can be fired through walls and the sound of Cryo Explosions never seems to get old.    Still, I think that I prefer the **Salarian Infiltrator** slightly more as he's more useful on the larger, more open maps. His abilities mean he can deal with pretty much anything this game can throw at him:  * **Tactical Cloak** is always useful. More damage and the ability to move around the battlefield slightly easier.  * **Energy Drain** is obviously useful for taking out shields and replenishing your own which is great since Cloaking stops your shields from recharging. It's a bit annoying that it only seems to trigger Fire, Cryo and Tech bursts on enemies that are either Synthetic or are shielded but it will still stagger most targets, giving you a few seconds to line up a headshot or get out of the way.  * **Proximity Mine** lets you stagger and debuff groups as well as killing the weaker mooks outright. The vulnerability upgrade works wonders against the tougher 'elite' units.  * **The Claymore** useful against for everything else. ",™

There is a work around for this though, the first thing you will need to do is go to the Settings menu. - Select Display Settings - Select Video Output Settings - Check only 480p and 1080p This should force the game to display in it's expected resolution Keep in mind that if you are going to play a game that is displayed in a lower resolution you will need to readjust the previous settings. For the refresh rate, you can turn off BD 1080p 24 hz Output (HDMI), this will be located under the Settings menu as well. - Select Video Settings - Select BD 1080p 24 hz Output (HDMI) - Select Off You may also want to contact the manufacturer of the TV to see if there are any firmware updates, if it can support 240 Hz refresh rates at 720p, or if it's only in the higher resolutions",®

t5_2sgq6,syriquez,1354127124,"&gt; The problem isn't skewed profit perspectives. Because the fact that WoW still has like 10 million subs is a clear testament that people are willing to play games like this and are willing to pay sub fees for quality content. So while obviously the profit ideas could be skewed, the key problem was always the gameplay. People didn't switch from WoW not necessarily because they had everything there, but because what the market offered was games that were WoW, and often were done worse. If they did something different it often felt incomplete, broken, rushed, smacked in there, or just buggy. WoW was better because it was so well made.  I'm going to tell you right now that being well-made isn't really the reason WoW was successful. 50% of it was timing (the casual MMO market was **completely** untapped, it was a niche *nobody* was exploiting), 50% of it was Blizzard's trademark ingenuity. If all it took was being well-made, WoW would never have gotten so big.  Blizzard's strength has always been their ability to objectively look at a market they're moving to break into...and look around for *strictly* what works and doesn't work. There's a reason why Starcraft and Warcraft II became the *du jour* games for competitive play in the RTS genre, as you have to remember that back then, that market was extremely competitive as well...at least until Starcraft/WC2 basically killed everything off except for the occasional showing by Command &amp; Conquer. And even then, I don't recall C&amp;C ever having much of a competitive scene, at least nothing to the scale of Starcraft. Blizzard took what worked well: the social, casual-friendly gameplay possible with an MMO and near-universal compatibility. And removed what didn't: the bullshit that catered strictly to hardcore gamers, the only people ""stupid enough"" to pay $15+/month, like 75 person raids that required military precision, experience penalties on death, every bit of leveling requiring group dedication to succeed, and bad pacing (no ""hell levels"", that is).  And honestly, if you take all of that and consider the market for which the game was released, I'd actually say that WoW's success is 100% because of timing. Nobody else was taking the casual MMO player's money. Not a single other game. They beat everybody else to the punch and everybody else is now trying to catch up.  ---  *EDIT* I feel I should comment on your mention of TERA and GW2 earlier.  TERA and GW2 were never going to succeed at ""beating"" WoW. What they represent, however, will be the *Next Big MMO™*. Many players are getting tired of playing the same old thing, sitting with their auto-attack and cycling powers when the button flashes. TERA and GW2 are likely going to be the first steps towards whatever will be the next large game, with TERA showcasing some of, if not currently *the* finest combat that sword-and-sorcery MMOs have to offer and GW2 being on the opposite end with what I understand to be some of the best questing design made as of yet (I personally haven't played it and won't because NCSoft are dickbutts but from what I've read, the questing is supposed to be fantastic). The *Next Big MMO™* is going to be some amalgamation of TERA's combat, GW2's questing, WoW's ease-of-access, and next perfect timing, which will probably coincide with whenever WoW's population breaches its equilibrium point.",™

t5_2qqjc,atheistjubu,1354127788,"&gt;It seems that researchers mostly agree that there is a difference **Intelligence Quotient**™ between races,   FTFY.    1. IQ is a list of arbitrarily weighted trivia questions, selected math problems, and excepts for English reading ability designed to make people rankable. There's no reason to call it the same thing as ""intelligence"", even with its highly suggestive name of ""*Intelligence* Quotient"".  And this all assumes that intelligence is a measurable quantity, reducible to a single rankable number.  2. The test given is highly culturally specific.  If I asked the Maasai for a test of intelligence, no doubt they would have me do things I'm not practiced in, like lion hunting, and mud hut building, and test my knowledge by asking for pieces of their pop culture.  It seems far more likely to me that IQ/GRE/SAT tests are quantifying different cultures' emphasis on various skills (along with the degree of assimilation into the majority culture): if English literary proficiency and lingual mastery isn't emphasized by your culture or peers and your parents' abilities on these fronts leaves you at a disadvantage (e.g. the case among inner city blacks), it's hardly surprising that you'll test poorly on it.  If quantitative reasoning and academic success is the hallmark of any respectable individual in your culture (as in many Asian and Asian-American cultures), I wouldn't be the least bit surprised to see you performing better on test oriented towards that end.",™

t5_2qknj,IronEngineer,1354133278,"Oh yeah, the statement Massimo made about the company being non existent were just wrong.  No doubt there.  Also, some of them definitely did work as subcontractors.  No dispute there either.  Here is the problem:  ""We started our company over 15 years ago in the north of Italy, in a very small town. Our company used to be a contractor for the manufacturing of Arduino™""  Here they are claiming their company was a contractor for manufacturing.  That is an incorrect statement, and the heart of this whole dispute if I have been reading it correctly.  This very well might be a translation problem, but here they are not claiming they have people who used to work for the manufacturer, here they are claiming their company was a manufacturer, which is not true.  As for the Arduino name on the prototype, hopefully you are correct, and the name is removed before going to production.  However, this is the wording they've used on their website:  &gt;The most common smARtHOST is the smARtHOST ARDUINO™ which &gt;replicates the size and the connections of an Arduino™ board. You &gt;can just plug a smARtCORE on this smARtHOST and you actually get &gt;a fully 100% Arduino™ compatible board, actually a clone.  &gt;The genius of the System is, as noted, that you can exchange &gt;different kind of smARtCOREs so you can have a pin to pin Arduino™ &gt;compatible board that can receive any shield made for that platform, &gt;running a totally different kind of CPU.  &gt;smARtHOST ARDUINO™ + smARtCORE U = ARDUINO™ UNOsmARtHOST   &gt;ARDUINO™ + smARtCORE U = ARDUINO™ UNO  This just seems to me like they were actually planning on selling the variant as smARtHOST ARDUINO, who ARDUINO UNOsmARtHOST.  This is particularly so as that name is bolded on their website.  Every other product they list on the kickstarter name whose name is bolded has a listing on their official website using the same name, and it appears that is what they intend to sell them as.  From reading their kickstarter stuff again I have an interesting theory to put forth.  I don't think Dimitri actually understands the trademark law.  He recognizes that Arduino is a trademarked name and goes to a lot of effort to put the little TM next to every place its used:  In board descriptions, in the name, on the prototype board (which might be a production board as they claim it is fully developed), etc.  Maybe he actually believes that as long as he puts the TM next to the name that makes it ok?  To be perfectly fair he has been operating out of China now for a number of years and they have pretty lax trademark protection there.  Just a theory based on what I've been seeing.  I still think this is going to end up in court someday, on a trademark challenge.  The absolute worst case scenario (assuming everyone keeps level heads) is that Dimitri has to change the name of a couple of the products and lower case /the AR in smARt or otherwise split up the wording with something.

t5_2rfxx,TerraRising,1354135712,"I respectfully disagree.  A ""Home Run"" would have been something like a two-week sale with the bonus RP option, and all three skin sales options, plus a few added surprises.  This ""sale"" is more like a single that passed the shortstop; A safe hit when the team needed something big.  Remember that this was in response to Hippalus and his team not planning anything for Black Friday, when players and parents could spend money on RP and RP Cards while doing their holiday shopping.  So, instead of that two week skin and champ mega-sale like in 2011, we're getting a slightly larger but regular one with the possibility of little advance notice.  Not to mention the legacy skin sale, possibly with a similar short notice, and a skin retirement sale happening ""soon™.""  Not my idea of a home run, but we'll see at their next at-bat.

t5_2qxih,miztix,1354144712,"&gt;The vastness of space. Mostly unexplored, yet teeming with life and possibilities.  &gt;Many spacers enjoy the serenity of the stars, the peace of floating through the Unknown Regions, wondering if they’re seeing events and phenomena never before witnessed by intelligent life. But for others, space is just another battleground in the Great War. It can be used as a place to hide from enemies, but more often it’s where the greatest warriors of the stars prove their skill… and their loyalty.  &gt;Our primary focus for the Space Missions in Star Wars™: The Old Republic has always been to make the player feel like they were taking part in the much larger Star Wars struggle, while still playing a pivotal and individual role in an encounter’s success. With that in mind, we are going to be introducing a number of new Heroic missions in Game Update 1.6 for both Imperial and Republic players available at level 50.  &gt;These missions will be repeatable, incredibly challenging, and reward players who enjoy the current Space Missions. Our goal is to make these missions worthy of the most skilled players, and completing them, along with their Bonus Objectives, should test the greatest pilots. To help in this endeavor, players will also be able to get new upgrades for their ship, attainable through various means like trade skills and specialty vendors. The rewards for these missions will also be increased, and hopefully provide new motivations for players who want to improve their gear for use in Flashpoints and Operations.  &gt;As we’ve stated in the past, quality of life is always one of our focuses for dedicated players in Star Wars: The Old Republic, so there will also be a number of improvements players can look forward to. For instance, a number of our missions will perform better on lower-end machines. We’ll also be adding one of our favorite changes: a missile and torpedo counter that literally reflects how much ammunition you have remaining. Oh, and did we mention it might be necessary to fire more than one proton torpedo in some of these missions?  &gt;We look forward to getting all of your feedback and reactions to the new missions, and we hope you enjoy them as much as we do.

t5_2qrz8,indgosky,1354156172,"&gt; hah test tube meat, sounds gross out loud, doesn't it?   Actually, no, I'd love to see us make that work -- as long as it has all the nutritive properties of natural meat, and doesn't turn us into some kind of genetic disaster a generation or two down the way.  &gt; cage free does use a bit more resources, more work and more possible environmental damage because the mess is harder to contain, and of course, more land.   I dunno about that.  Plenty of people with standard, 1/4 acre suburban plots (80% of which is filled with a house) manage to raise chickens or rabbits and use zero additional land than people who buy meat and eggs at the grocery store.  And they use the manure to feed their veggie gardens.  There's not a lot of additional resource consumption going on there, nor unused waste.  Aquaponics is also getting big (now *that's* efficient use of resources!!)  And if I've already got a few acres, most of which is just grass and weeds anyway, free-ranged chickens are basically no overhead.  &gt;  I wouldn't blame you if you wanted revenge because someone was pissing you off  Well, I don't think of education as ""revenge"", and that's all I'm really aiming to do, though I won't deny that I take a certain amount of satisfaction is seeing a smug expression drain off of a person as they get educated.  &gt; of course some people are going to be veggies without giving a crap about animals, knowing anything about farming, or caring at all for the environment. Some people only do it strictly for health or for special diets. Some for religious reasons. Some for losing weight. Some just want to try it. I am totally cool with that.  Me too.  But those groups aren't the ones who act superior and militant about the subject, either. They shrug off and are unoffended/unaffected by others' meaty lifestyles because they aren't doing what they do To Save The World™  Anyway, believe me when I say that I fully separate out, and have separate feelings about, the veg'ns who do it as a personal choice, and those who do it to rub it in others' faces.  I've known plenty of both, and it's only the latter group that I'd take any joy in ""waking up"".  Cheers",™

t5_2qhb9,rmc,1354204516,"&gt; Ask feminists.  I'm a feminist! ☺   My point was that lots of people might call a thing ""rape"", but the law might call it a different crime. Like a ""murder"" / ""manslaughter"" difference. A certain act might be illegal, and might not count as ""rape"", but many people might informally call it ""rape"". So do we mean the social defintion of rape or the legal one? What about when someone posts ""im gay"" on your Facebook wall? Does that count?  For example [Section 3 of the 1990 act](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1990/en/act/pub/0032/print.html#sec3) defines the crime of ""aggrevated sexual assault"" as ""means **a sexual assault that involves** serious violence or the threat of serious violence **or is such as to cause** injury, humiliation or **degradation of a grave nature to the person assaulted**."" (emphasis mine). So a woman doing a man in the ass with a strap on (for example), would (I presume) count as an indecent assault that would cause humilitation or grave degradation. That's punishable by up to life imprisonment and is a felony.  &gt; Agree. But as far as I can tell it's only changed to add some extra legalese and give children even more specific rights.  It adds extra crimes, so a man could analy rape another man under the 1990 law, but not under the 1981 law (mind you all anal sex / sodomy was technically illegal in 1981).",☺

t5_2qhb9,rmc,1354205871,"Yes that appears to be the case. ☹ That should be changed, to legally refer to that as rape. Words matter.  However, if a woman held down a man, it would (as I said) almost certainly be illegal, with life imprisonment as the maximum sentance. Not ""rape"" in the legal sense, but a serious crime.  After all, if a man held a woman down and fisted/fingered her ass and made her suck his fingers/a dildo/a gun, forced her to strip and fondled her all over the place, and got his buddy around to take photos of her naked that that wouldn't count as rape either.

He plays into people's fears and disregards anything that would reassure the readers. From what I know and what he is saying, I don't trust his word in the things that I don't know much about. In my eyes, he is about as trustworthy as Deepak Chopra or a youtube commenter with run-on sentences and racial slurs.  &gt; How dare he try to make a living!   Hey, nothing wrong with making a living; it just depends on how you go about doing it. I have nothing against selling supplements that have a basis behind them (and many that he sells do), but he's sort of on the borderline with his website methodology. For example, it's sort of like ""hey I heard you are worried about (current conspiracy fearmongering)! Here is some stuff from me that supports it. I've got some nice supplements and devices that will help you out with that."" To me that's just as bad as selling snake oil; it's just shady. The fact that he is enabling misunderstanding or FUD for profit makes him a quack in my eyes.   &gt; Also, so there's no conflict of interest in the pharmaceutical companies running the CDC, making billions off of what the CDC says, but there is a conflict of interest in a doctor throwing his career away because he disagrees with the system and backing products that are inline with his views? Okay...  If we're starting to reference fallicies this is another one (a red herring?); because you feel the pharmaceutical companies are running the CDC, that makes it okay for to overlook Mercola and the conflict of interest? In my eyes, they both deserve scrutiny and criticism; just because you're described as the lesser of two evils does not mean that you are not still evil.  &gt; You don't think that stress can play a factor in turning HIV into AIDS?  Sure, stress can play a factor, it always does; but it's not the *cause* of AIDS like what Mercola apparently believes. If it were the cause, then why don't stressed out people *without HIV* get AIDS? Why do they need to be under stress *and* HIV-positive to get AIDS? Maybe it's because a base requirement of AIDS is being HIV positive. It's sort of a give-away that HIV ""attacks"" the cells that are characteristically low in AIDS (apparently CD4^+ T lymphocytes)  &gt; Microwaves are dangerous. You don't think sending radiation into your food changes it?  Do you even know how microwave ovens work to heat food, or are you just scared of the word ""radiation""? Did you know that the stuff that comes from the sun (light) is referred to as radiation? When you turn on your incandescent light bulb, it gives off radiation too. When we use radiation in these terms, we're referring to electromagnetic radiation, which includes visible light. Above visible light we have dangerous radiation -- UV, x-ray, and gamma rays. Below visible light, we have lower-energy (less problematic) radiation -- infra-red, microwaves, radio waves.  The way microwaves work is that a device puts out microwaves (which are lower-energy than infra-red), and those waves go into a cavity where the food it. The waves interact with the walls and create a ""large"" oscillating electric field. Since water is a polar molecule, it reacts to this field. The electric field oscillates at a speed that is along a ""sweet spot"" dielectric loss region particular to water. If the field oscillated slower, then the water molecules would have time to fully react; faster, and the molecules wouldn't react much at all. In this sweet spot, it jostles the molecules enough that the interaction within the material imparts kinetic energy (heat) into the molecule. That's it.   The reason why UV rays, x-rays, and gamma-rays are dangerous is because they have enough energy to break atomic bonds. If the bonds are broken, they might recombine in ways that cause damage or errors that lead to cancer. From least energetic to most energetic (again): radio waves, microwaves, infra-red, visible light, UV, x-ray, gamma rays.  Anyway, I haven't seen or heard *anything* unusual regarding microwaves and cooking. I say ""unusual"" because cooking in itself produces some carcinogens; for example, [PAHs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyaromatic_hydrocarbons) and [acrylamide](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrylamide). Plus ""regular"" cooking reduces nutrients just like mercola says (heat in general destroys some fragile nutrients)  &gt; Warning letters?  Warning letters for making false and misleading claims regarding the marketing of several natural supplemental products. Warning letters because he was essentially bullshitting with his products. Honestly, if he and his products are credible then why does he have to bullshit at all?  &gt; I wonder if any large pharmaceutical company has gotten any warning letters/been sued, etc.?  I don't care if other people have done worse; that's just another red herring. Just because other companies lie or are quacks, some shady activity is permissible? Ridiculous.  &gt; Go ahead and debate him on the list of things you gave. Tell me why aspartame and mercury are good for you and why vitamin D is unimportant.  I pasted the list in its entirety and debated whether I should bold the terms that were relevant and explain, but I thought that would make a wall of text. But just because you found a couple things on that list that were okay doesn't make the rest of the critcisms invalid. Anyway, here goes:  Aspartame - conspiracy nut magnet. You can't do a search on the internet for aspartame without running into someone who had some poorly-founded claims about how aspartame ruined their marriage, killed their dog, and made them default on their mortgage. The way I see it is that if you are decided on a soft drink, drinking 40 mg of aspartame is healthier than drinking 40 g of sugar. Sugar has clear health effects, where as aspartame has a bunch of questions spouted from people who are convinced it's bad somehow. Obviously drinking neither of these is more healthy, but that's not usually enough of a reason.  Cancer - this is so general as it's not really applicable.   Fitness - being fit is proven to be good for your health  Fluoride - conspiracy nut magnet. It's okay to be skeptical, but you have to ask yourself ""what would make me drop my case on this""; if it's ""nothing"" then you're not a skeptic, you're a conspiracy theorist (or the derogatory ""conspiratard"" which separates out good and bad conspiracy theorists). Oh, *but Big Brother...*  Fructose/Sugar - I've always thought that sugar is bad and that sugar (along with bad habits) plays a major role in the ""obesity epidemic."" I believe that drinking sugar (even fruit juices) plays havoc with your insulin and such; I avoid any liquid sugar calories.  GMO - GMO is inherently neutral; like something like gasoline. Gasoline can be used to make weapons, or it can be used in growing organic food. GMO is just a tool and too many people conflate an unsavoury corporation's actions with GMO. These people also have this idea that ""natural"" foods have zero risk attached to them, and that's not true at all; most people just don't care to pay attention to the health effects of ""natural"" foods. Things like rhubarb and beets have high oxalate contents, which can contribute to kidney stones. Flavonoids (present in ""natural"" foods) can also cause DNA damage. So ""natural"" is not equivocal to safe. Plus we've been meddling with plants since we got onto agriculture; genetic modifications are just more of a direct way of doing it (enabling things that are impossible). For sure bad things can be done with it, but so can great things. I think GMO are the next step in our agriculture, and we should not be luddites in the matter; we should approach it cautiously and perform adequate testing on the products and their results. The greed-centred stuff (patents, terminator gene) and conflict of inherent in the FDA (I am not American) are issues that I'd be wary about, not making sweeping judgements like GMO ≡ evil.  Mercury - mercury is provably bad, and after some threshold. Heavy metals are bad in general, and this is no secret. Minimizing exposure is a good idea, but sometimes it's unavoidable; so long as you stay within safe limits, you should be okay. We do *real* science to find these limits.  Nutritional Typing - If this is what I think it is, then this is a load of horse shit. Here is the only tip you need (a quote): ""Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants.""  Pets - pets is general and nothing to do with conspiracy.  Vaccines - bullshit sensors going off the charts here. Anti-vax is the latest craze among the scientific illiterate. Big conspiracies centred around vaccines. Who knows, maybe some vaccines don't work, are unnecessary, or are pushed by some greedy company; *many* of the vaccines are beneficial to a person's health in the general case (i.e. a numbers game). Some of them I have no use for (like influenza), but other ones I made a point to get (hepatitis A/B, MMR, tetanus)  Vitamin D - vitamin D has recently shown to have a notable role in our health. Unfortunately, when this kind of science gets published, people run with it and it becomes a cure-all for a time. I'm not even that old, and I've seen dozens of these kinds of cure-alls in my life that aren't as ""magic"" after the fad wears off. For example: unsaturated fats, omega 3 fats, vitamin e, apple cider vinegar, echinacea, wheat grass, red wine (resveratrol), etc. I'm not saying that none of these are effective, it's just that someone sees a little bit of evidence for them doing *something* and all of a sudden people just eat it up and it becomes the Next Big Cure™ after the previous non-effective one gets depreciated.  So there; wall of text.",™

What has she done that was 'polarizing' exactly? The main thing people know her for is standing up to the big banks and even *most* of the educated republican middle class have bitched and moaned about the banks and their unfettered powers. She's an attorney. Republicans love rich, big business folks. Isn't that how they wound up with Romney as a nominee? Is she polarizing because she's  woman? Republicans got behind Sarah Palin pretty strongly and *still* (God knows why) support her as a possible presidential candidate.  Listen to me: ANYONE is considered 'polarizing' whenever the group feeling polarized is unrealistic and has heads full of ideas that are incorrect, inaccurate and based on fear and ignorance as fed to them by Fox News.   This idea that rational politicians (and she is...as is Obama) are some radicals who want to become evil tyrants or dictators is ridiculous. It's just another part of the false narrative.   If you offer up a politician that the GOP feel are *not* polarizing, then you're in trouble because it's going to be someone who *is* a republican and not just a republican but a staunch one.  Republicans have gone as far right as they have in the history of this nation. If something seems 'polarizing' to them it's because it doesn't fit into the false narrative that they've been fed by Fox for the most part. Obama is a *centrist.* Repeat after me, kids: Obama is NOT a super liberal. By most liberal standards, he's way too far right and that's based by putting his ideals and stances in a historical perspective of what a real liberal agenda *can* be when it comes to hardline liberals.   But to the right, they've sent him straight from MEGALIBERAL™ to socialist and that's undoubtedly because they don't look at politics in a standardized way as put into perspective by history and previous presidents and their beliefs/agendsas.   Do people REALLY think that a super liberal president would be promoting laws that allow Americans to be detained without a warrant? Drones flying around? Laws that impeded the privacy and freedom of Americans for every walk of life? A bunch of banks running the show from behind the curtain? That's not a true liberal and that's SURE as fuck not a socialist. The problem isn't Obama; the problem is that we've ended up with a nation of folks who lack the most basic knowledge about politics and history as they both pertain to America. ",™

t5_2sokh,JakeDeLaPlaya,1354270802,"&gt;surely its more potent in the Bear spray because it's made for fucking bears?  Actually its not. If it says that, its because of marketing.  Bear spray is often the same thing as regular pepper spray but in a different package and a fogging nozzle instead of a stream.  It may also include some additional stickiness to defeat the bears oily fur.    &gt;Currently the EPA requires that the concentration of Capsaicin and related capsaicinoids range between 1 and 2.0%. The variance in potency within this range is negligible, and all will affect the eyes, nose, throat and lungs of a bear. The minimum size can the EPA will register currently is 7.9 ounces, or 225 grams. [source](http://www.centerforwildlifeinformation.org/BeBearAware/BearSpray/bearspray.html)    And here's an advertisement from Mace Pepper spray:  &gt;TAKE DOWN EXTREME® PEPPER GEL® is our strongest pepper spray, a 1.4% capsaicinoids concentration  As you can see, the capsaicinoids concentration is in the same i range in both the bear spray and people spray.   Incidentally, its all made from hot peppers and the heat of the pepper used is the most important thing. Sometimes they use a lot of tabasco peppers or a few habaneros but there's an equal amount of heat in both formulations. They'll even advertise the one using tabasco is hotter since it technically has more OC. However it has fewer capsaicinoids.   Scolville Heat Units (SHU) are actually the best measure of pepper spray heat.    &gt; why people actually have died from asphyxiating because of it.   If they died after being sprayed with OC, its because they most likely weren't generally healthy.  Someone with severe asthma and no inhaler may be in risk of asphyxiation.   Edit: death portion.

I feel like advertising it as a super ""girly"" place excludes women like me that just want to go there to be around other women (though it doesn't take long to figure out this wouldn't be a good place).

Then, due to the development that farm land became valuable retail space and the home owners started complaining about the development of land they didn't own. 🎻  My grandfather lived in the North Linden area and growing up Dad told me stories of riding his bike on I-71 while it was under construction, and how the teachers gave up on teaching kids as workers moved houses down the street in front of the school building (the houses were relocated to make room for the freeway).  When Dad was learning to drive, the only building on Morse Road was that fortune teller place (it's still there) - everything else was farm fields.  When I was learning to drive Polaris Parkway was a freshly paved two-lane road and the BP near the freeway ramp was the only structure.

t5_2qp5l,RowThaWay_,1354316082,"Here are a couple of great videos with a focus on the sedimentary evidence:   Part 1: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sD_7rxYoZY  Part 2: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfSvktyxVYA  The reason I like these is that it's near impossible to come up with a decent argument - even by JW standards - for why there is absolutely no evidence in the earth. For other things like taking care of the animals, getting them back to their habitats and so on they will just say, ""GOD CAN DO MIRACLES, THERE'S PROOF™ IN THE BIBLE. YOUR ARGUMENT IS INVALID."" But for this, God would have to actively falsify the sedimentary evidence across the *entire earth* to fill in the period where the flood supposedly happened and make it consistent with the last, oh I don't know, few billion years? People will try the, ""If he left definitive evidence, there would be no need for faith,"" rubbish, but it wouldn't even be evidence that God caused the flood, just that there was *a* flood(this obviously ignores the other impossibilities of the flood like where the water came from and such, but that's another matter).",™

From the discussion:  &gt; The 1:130 ratio is the dispersant:oil mix actually used in the Deep Water Horizon spill: 4.9 millions of barrels of crude oil released into the Gulf of Mexico (OSAT/NOAA report, 2010), and about two million gallons of oil dispersant (mainly Corexit) applied to the Gulf of Mexico (On Scene Coordinator Report Deep Water Horizon, 2011).  So, basically, as it was used in the Gulf, there was no increased toxicity.",®
