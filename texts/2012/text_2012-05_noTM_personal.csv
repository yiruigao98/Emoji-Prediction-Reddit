And you should add browser extensions to that, most extensions run a script each time a website is loaded.

A few years ago the best things we had were ""rounded borders"" in Chrome and Firefox, Internet Explorer didn't got that until IE9. The same with JavaScript, now AJAX is heavily used, and jQuery is there in any website, and you can also render 3D stuff, and people still animate stuff with jQuery instead of CSS.

t5_2qh1i,WinningTheGame,1335848608,"First post ever, so forgive the lack of details and such.  This went down when I was in the 11th grade at my high school. This new, kinda weird chick was in my history class and sat in front of me. I went to a rather small school so everyone knows who everyone is somehow or another. We'd talk once in a while but that was it. One day while on Facebook I decided to creep on her profile and the first thing that stuck out to me was a link to a journal entry on ""deviantart"". I go to the link and it turns out to be a poem she wrote about her grandfather who had recently passed away, but I noticed there were a few other entries in her journal. As I looked through them, only because I had nothing better to do in my spare time, I came across one about a boy she went to school with. To my astonishment the damn post was about me.  Here's a bit of one of the posts I found. ( I ‚ô• ""WinningTheGame""! love Love LOVE!!! ohmygosh,, did he just look at me?! HE DID! ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooh! Hername &amp; ""WinningTheGame"" 4-ever! Gawd he's hot, I love his smile, 49 is my new lucky number 'cause that's ""WinningTheGame""s football number! Blue is the best color ever 'cause his eyes are blue!"") There were a few of these that quite honestly surprised, and sort of flattered me. Now that sounds like it's the creepy part. Nope! I decided since she would have no idea that I would have ever stumbled upon this journal that I should go ahead and comment on a few of her posts, and to reveal information about her that only someone who knew her would know, ie, hair color, real name, class's she was in. I thought nothing of this behavior at the time. She ended up super weirded out and asked me repeatedly in messages to tell her who I was, even offering to draw me a picture in return for an answer, but I averted these by simply not replying. Now that I look back on it, I feel rather bad for the girl. I was the real creep in this situation.   TL;DR  Found a ""slightly creepy"" post about me from classmate's Facebook page, then proceeded to creep her the fuck out by telling her I knew her and things about her.   EDIT: I just realized by creeping back through this that she probably had a really good idea who I was, seeing as I had used the numbers 49 in my username... She fucking knew I was being a creep. &gt;.&gt;",14,39,0,0,0,1,‚ô•

SCENESSE¬Æ is delivered via a subcutaneous dissolving implant approximately the size of a grain of rice. Increased pigmentation of the skin appears after two days and lasts up to two months.*  *Alpha-Melanocyte Stimulating Hormone (Œ±-MSH) is a naturally occurring peptide hormone which is released by skin cells in response to the stimulation by ultraviolet radiation (UVR). Œ±-MSH has a very short half life (seconds) in the blood stream, sufficient to reach and stimulate other skin cells (melanocytes) which in turn produce and release melanin, a dark brown pigment. Melanin is known for its photoprotective effect.*  [http://www.clinuvel.com/index.php/scenesse](http://www.clinuvel.com/index.php/scenesse)  I've spoken at length to someone involved - they're basically giving people a suntan, without exposing them to the sun. EPP is ridiculously rare - Clinuvel reckon on around 10,000 diagnoses worldwide. They hope in time to be able to market the drug as a treatment for other similar skin conditions - Vitiligo being one of them.    ",424,31,0,0,1,1,¬Æ

t5_2qh13,arte_misia,1335900264,"You are thinking about the Icesave dispute and the two referendums. This dispute is between the Icelandic gov and the governments of the UK and the Netherlands.    It is about the Icelandic State‚Äôs guarantee of repayments by the Depositors‚Äô and Investors‚Äô Guarantee Fund in Iceland to the UK and the Kingdom of the Netherlands. These repayments are in respect of costs incurred by the two states (UK and Dutch) when they paid deposit guarantees to the customers of Landsbanki Islands in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands.    Icesave was an online savings account brand owned and operated by the private Landsbanki  bank from 2006 to 2008. It operated in two countries ‚Äì the United Kingdom and the Netherlands.    On 6 October 2008, the Icelandic government pushed an emergency law through Iceland's parliament, the Althing, in response to the ""unusual financial market circumstances"".    In a separate measure, the government also guaranteed ""that deposits in domestic commercial and savings banks and their branches in Iceland will be fully covered."" The FME, Financial Supervisory Authority, placed Landsbanki in receivership early on 7 October.    A press release from the FME stated that all ""domestic deposits"" were fully guaranteed.   On 8 October, the UK the Treasury went on to freeze the assets of Landsbanki and assets belonging to the Central Bank of Iceland, and the Government of Iceland relating to Landsbanki.  The arguments of the British and Dutch governments are based on their interpretation of the law of the European Economic Area (EEA), and around two positions in particular:    ‚ñ™that the Icelandic government is obliged to guarantee at least the first ‚Ç¨20,000 in Icesave accounts;    ‚ñ™that Iceland's actions surrounding the collapse of Landsbanki are discriminatory against non-Icelandic creditors.    The Icelandic government disputes these positions.   An agreement was reached between UK, Netherlands and Icelandic negotiators, and a bill was presented to the Icelandic parliament in June 2009. Opponents of the bill argued that no clear legal obligation existed for Iceland to pay the lost deposits.    There was wide dissatisfaction with the new bill among the populace, and the president was petitioned by approximately 23 per cent of Iceland's voters, to put the issue before a referendum.    A referendum was held on 6 March 2010 where the proposed bill was defeated, with 93 per cent voting against and less than 2 per cent in favor.     After the referendum, new negotiations commenced. On 16 February 2011 the Icelandic parliament agreed to a repayment deal to pay back the full amount starting in 2016, finalizing before 2046, with a fixed interest rate of 3 per cent.   The bill provided for authorization to the Minister of Finance for state guarantees for reimbursement to the gov. of the UK and the Netherlands. Majority of voters were against granting this guarantee.     A referendum was held on April 9 2011, the deal was rejected, 39.7 per cent of voters voted in favor of the agreement, while 58.9 per cent voted against it.     The case will now be brought before the EFTA Court.  If the EFTA Court finds that there is a breach, Iceland will be required to take immediate actions to comply with that judgment.    TL;DR The debt of a private bank should be paid by that bank. Not the citizens of the country where that bank was located.",7710,40170,0,0,1,1,‚ñ™

There is something similar for chrome but I forget what it's called.  With Firebug it divides your browser into panels so you can examine, or edit if it's your page, the CSS (or HTML) of a webpage to see what all the different elements are.   Here is a [screencap of this page](http://i.imgur.com/xq6jo.png) with Firebug opened, as an example.   So, I have clicked the area in the sidebar that says ""CSS help ‚Üô subscribe!"" and if I wanted to change that in the CSS then I know exactly what to change because the code for it appears in the bottom right panel (the left panel is HTML).  For example, I could copy,to the clipboard, the code:      .titlebox h1:after {     content: "" ‚Üô subscribe!"";     font-size: 10px;  then go to the edit stylesheet area of my subreddit (if this was my subreddit) and paste the code that I copied, in to the stylesheet, and change it to:      .titlebox h1:after {     content: "" ‚Üô subscribe or die a horrible death!"";     font-size: 666px;  and it would look quite frightening, indeed.   I sometimes open up Firebug on a webpage or subreddit when I see something unusual just to see how they did it, and I find it is helping me to get a better understanding of CSS.

Ironically neither of us knew that the other had been thinking of the same thing. One day Jordan called me up and pitched the idea, I was ecstatic and explained that I had been wanting to do the same thing! We each had mediocre plans in our heads but once we got together and began to brainstorm it quickly bloomed into a very realistic and achievable dream.   &gt;We knew our first attempt was going to be more of a learning experience than a realistic ""underwater room"". It consisted of a net tied to large rocks with climbing webbing, we put a piece of plastic under the net and let a large bubble into it with a SCUBA tank. As proof of concept it was great but it was far from realistic. The biggest problem was that it was unstable and all of the force was focused on the four corners of the net. We were able to swim around it and ""feel"" it and see where the stresses were and how to improve it.   &gt;Over the course of the next several weeks we did lots of math and research, drawings and scale models. We are now on ""version 3"" which is by far the best and most user friendly design so far.""  [Source](http://subaqua.alldaydrive.com/history.php)",76729,10094,0,0,1,1,¬Æ

Today I had my 1st chiropractic appointment for the nausea/vomiting/migraines AND I stepped down the Zofran pump dose with my HHA for the 1st time. This is officially step 1 in the plan of getting me off medication, well enough to work, and on a more natural health plan for the duration of this pregnancy. Prayers totally appreciated! I really believe God wants to use this to heal me and to help us have this baby. ‚ô•  From what she's posted on Facebook I gather she's had a horrible pregnancy. I genuinely feel sorry for her. She's been sick so much that she's lost a lot of weight. I probably won't say anything to her about chiropractic, the naturalistic fallacy, or her belief in a god either in person or on Facebook.  On the other hand, another coworker has professed belief in ESP and lots of magical thinking like the moon affecting behavior (of women, especially). During several friendly discussions I've tried to persuade them to look at the evidence (or lack thereof) behind the claims they believe in. These conversations were all in person and I've made it clear how intolerant I am about the supernatural and pseudo-scientific beliefs they espouse.  I mostly hold my tongue if someone I know is spouting nonsense. However, if my friend's beliefs don't seem to be personal, I consider them fair game and open to criticism.",24442,2060,0,0,1,1,‚ô•

t5_2qh38,paranoidelephpant,1336135739,"&gt; So if you had been storing passwords in say, 5.3.6, and you upgraded to PHP 5.3.11, your old password hashes using $2a$ would not work.  That's incorrect. Your hashes will continue to work just fine in most cases. There was a (long-known) bug in crypt &lt;= 1.0 which incorrectly handled 8-bit characters. Standard ASCII characters between 0-127 are 7-bit. Characters in the extended table (128 - 255) are 8-bit. The bcrypt algorithm wasn't processing 8-bit characters correctly, so that an internal variable was wrapping.  Crypt 1.1 fixed the issue, and crypt 1.2 introduced the new identifiers. `2a` was changed to correctly handle 8-bit characters, and has a ""safety bit"" to try to determine if it should use compatible behavior or not. `2x` was introduced to force the old behavior, so if administrators have problems with old hashes and users with 8-bit character passwords they can flip the hash identifiers until they migrate. And finally, `2y` was introduced to work exactly like `2a` without the safety bit.  It's perfectly safe to continue to use `2a`, but new projects should use `2y`. Administrators should try to migrate their hashes if they can, of course.  Here's an example of the hashes in action to show what I mean:      // Force the buggy behavior with an 8-bit character     php &gt; echo crypt('passwo¬Æd', '$2x$08$saltSALTsaltSALTsaltSA');     $2x$08$saltSALTsaltSALTsaltS.vn.k10Jng0Ss6klyD.aC3j0rJJcvGiy          // Use the new unbugged 2y identifier with an 8-bit character     php &gt; echo crypt('passwo¬Æd', '$2y$08$saltSALTsaltSALTsaltSA');     $2y$08$saltSALTsaltSALTsaltS.hcP.KrwDV9EVIurhmH2MsKp7VPLfjDq          // 2a works like 2y in PHP &gt;= 5.3.7, and like 2x in PHP &lt; 5.3.7     php &gt; echo crypt('passwo¬Æd', '$2a$08$saltSALTsaltSALTsaltSA');     $2a$08$saltSALTsaltSALTsaltS.hcP.KrwDV9EVIurhmH2MsKp7VPLfjDq  So you'll only run into problems if any of your users use characters from the extended ASCII table, which is extremely rare.",1749,76,0,0,1,1,¬Æ

Ideally, you should even respect people who disrespect you, but it is perfectly human of you not to.  Now. By respecting someone, I don't mean that you need to revere them.

No matter what my gender identity is, I like to allow people to see me as they want to see me. No less, no more.  **Gender is not a dichotomy.**  I cannot tell you for sure if you are trans or not. I cannot tell you which actions are appropriate for you. I am not you. However, I can share my own thoughts, feelings, and experiences with you. I can also certainly tell you that you are not alone in being confused.  Unfortunately, nopony, trans nor cis, can tell you what is right for you. This is something you have to discover for yourself. However, you do not have to discover it alone. There are many others out there, self included, willing to support you and your choices no matter what they are.  Try not to be afraid. I know that gender identity is confusing and scary. I also know that a lot of cis people really don't understand. In fact, a lot of trans people do not understand either. It's not always as simple as ""you are or you aren't"".  I personally think that you would not have made this post if this was not something you felt seriously about. I don't think you would have thought twice about it if you honestly and truly thought that you only wanted to ""be different"" as you said. However, again, I am not you, and I cannot speak for you.

'Almost the entire post is about that...And it gets stated multiple times,  Let me quote the numerous times it's stated, which makes up nearly my entire post: ""How can we stop people from messaging sponsors like this? First, I think we should start messaging the sponsors about how much of a MINORITY the complaints are that they receive from such things. We need to at least let them know that their continued sponsorship of our beloved players is important. We need to tell them how much we appreciate them sponsoring ANYONE, not how much we appreciate them having a hand in the removal of players. We need to explain what is happening in our community, if they do not already know----AND....AND I CAN NOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH----We need to do so intelligently...Not belligerent screaming, as I can only assume our ""assailants"" have done.""  ""If you think that messaging a sponsor because something offended you is HELPING this game out, you need to uninstall Starcraft II and never return to this board. You don't deserve the respect of anyone around you---You are not a knight, protecting some far-off castle from impending doom. You are a plague creeping into a society. ""  ""'Because, you see, as sponsors start to receive more and more messages like this; they are going to start to wonder why they should even be supporting this game we love so much.""  ""It's just a plea/rant---However you wish to take it...But I can't justify any means for which members of our community are messaging sponsors. No one , including myself, has to condone the things the players have done to receive these kinds of punishments, but you; as a fan of this game; have other means of communicating your negative feelings towards their actions. This is not one of them. Not like this, I do not want to see this community die off because of this rancid behavior.""  ""EDIT: I think I need to make this clear---I am not condoning the actions of Destiny or anyone...I am merely stating we need a better way to do this. If you're going to shit your brains out over one person, do it for all--And figure out a REASONABLE way to get things done. I feel like people are skimming over what I've said and taking away from it that I'm saying it's okay to say whatever you want. Please READ and ABSORB what is being said. I say it very clearly "" No one , including myself, has to condone the things the players have done to receive these kinds of punishments, but you; as a fan of this game; have other means of communicating your negative feelings towards their actions. "" )""  You're right. Something spoken about that many times couldn't ever possibly be the main point of the post. It's clearly a ruse to disguise my hidden racism, though I also state I do not agree with their actions.  I know reading comprehension is hard sometimes, but I am sure if you focus you'll get it.

t5_2qh6c,holstarox,1336290081,"It's in Leviticus 18:22 (I only memorised that when I heard it said on Family Guy and I wanted to remember to look it up). Although it's in the Bible, it's in the Old Testament, and in Leviticus. I know some people on here will disagree with me and say I'm not a ""true Christian"" for saying this, but I don't follow what's written in Leviticus. Most of the Old Testament is made up of parables - things that didn't really happen, but are made for the meaning, like the morals in Aesop's Fables.   Because the Old Testament was written before Jesus came to us, it was written for the Jews of the time. Christianity is different. Jesus never said a word against homosexuals, and he said that he and God love everything and everyone unconditionally. He doesn't love one person more than another, especially because one is straight and one it gay, or bisexual.   All in all - yes, you can be a Christian without being straight. You will not be judged in God's eyes because of your sexuality.   May the love of God be with you ‚ô•",3227,1337,0,0,1,1,‚ô•

First of all, What is your budget looking like?  The Z series is designed for TOTAL Portability and design in mind. If your looking at something that is going to be primarily stationary, then you dont really need something like the XPS 15Z, just go with an upgraded XPS 15, or get an Alienware: both of which are reasonably portable. The XPS 15z also only has a 720p display, which isnt going to be very good if your looking to ENJOY the gaming experience of playing Diablo 3. (Please note, Im not much of a Gamer!) The XPS 15z is more for the college student who is looking for something 15 inches, but light, and clean looking in terms of aesthetics.   Go with XPS 15, and upgrade the screen resolution. An upgraded XPS 15 with i5 processor, 6GB Memory, 750 Hard Drive, NVIDIA¬Æ GeForce¬Æ GT 525M 1GB graphics with Optimus Card, and 1920x1080 Display is STILL CHEAPER than the XPS 15z, coming at a total of $830+Tax after $100 off coupon, and the Dell Student Discount (PM me for these I cant post the Member purchase ID number on forums)   HOWEVER: UNTIL MAY 10th: If you want to upgrade the Video card to a NVIDIA¬Æ GeForce¬Æ GT 540M 2GB graphics with Optimus, then your total purchase price would then be CHEAPER: at $705+Tax, since we're offering 20% off all laptop purchases over $999. This is with the student discount as well.  If you want to plaay around with adding things to/from your cart, here's the Memmer Purchase Price Link: Dell.com/Berkeley.

t5_2qh1i,LexLuthor01,1336440508,"Step 1  The enzyme hexokinase phosphorylates (adds a phosphate group to) glucose in the cell's cytoplasm. In the process, a phosphate group from ATP is transferred to glucose producing glucose 6-phosphate.  Glucose (C6H12O6) + hexokinase + ATP ‚Üí ADP + Glucose 6-phosphate (C6H11O6P1)   Step 2  The enzyme phosphoglucoisomerase converts glucose 6-phosphate into its isomer fructose 6-phosphate. Isomers have the same molecular formula, but the atoms of each molecule are arranged differently.  Glucose 6-phosphate (C6H11O6P1) + Phosphoglucoisomerase ‚Üí Fructose 6-phosphate (C6H11O6P1)  Step 3  The enzyme phosphofructokinase uses another ATP molecule to transfer a phosphate group to fructose 6-phosphate to form fructose 1, 6-bisphosphate.   Fructose 6-phosphate (C6H11O6P1) + phosphofructokinase + ATP ‚Üí ADP + Fructose 1, 6-bisphosphate (C6H10O6P2)   Step 4  The enzyme aldolase splits fructose 1, 6-bisphosphate into two sugars that are isomers of each other. These two sugars are dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde phosphate.  Fructose 1, 6-bisphosphate (C6H10O6P2) + aldolase ‚Üí Dihydroxyacetone phosphate (C3H5O3P1) + Glyceraldehyde phosphate (C3H5O3P1)   Step 5  The enzyme triose phosphate isomerase rapidly inter-converts the molecules dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde phosphate. Glyceraldehyde phosphate is removed as soon as it is formed to be used in the next step of glycolysis.  Dihydroxyacetone phosphate (C3H5O3P1) ‚Üí Glyceraldehyde phosphate (C3H5O3P1)   Net result for steps 4 and 5: Fructose 1, 6-bisphosphate (C6H10O6P2) ‚Üî 2 molecules of Glyceraldehyde phosphate (C3H5O3P1)  Step 6  The enzyme triose phosphate dehydrogenase serves two functions in this step. First the enzyme transfers a hydrogen (H-) from glyceraldehyde phosphate to the oxidizing agent nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) to form NADH. Next triose phosphate dehydrogenase adds a phosphate (P) from the cytosol to the oxidized glyceraldehyde phosphate to form 1, 3-bisphosphoglycerate. This occurs for both molecules of glyceraldehyde phosphate produced in step 5.  A. Triose phosphate dehydrogenase + 2 H- + 2 NAD+ ‚Üí 2 NADH + 2 H+  B. Triose phosphate dehydrogenase + 2 P + 2 glyceraldehyde phosphate (C3H5O3P1) ‚Üí 2 molecules of 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate (C3H4O4P2)   Step 7  The enzyme phosphoglycerokinase transfers a P from 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate to a molecule of ADP to form ATP. This happens for each molecule of 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate. The process yields two 3-phosphoglycerate molecules and two ATP molecules.  2 molecules of 1,3-bisphoshoglycerate (C3H4O4P2) + phosphoglycerokinase + 2 ADP ‚Üí 2 molecules of 3-phosphoglycerate (C3H5O4P1) + 2 ATP   Step 8  The enzyme phosphoglyceromutase relocates the P from 3-phosphoglycerate from the third carbon to the second carbon to form 2-phosphoglycerate.  2 molecules of 3-Phosphoglycerate (C3H5O4P1) + phosphoglyceromutase ‚Üí 2 molecules of 2-Phosphoglycerate (C3H5O4P1)  Step 9  The enzyme enolase removes a molecule of water from 2-phosphoglycerate to form phosphoenolpyruvic acid (PEP). This happens for each molecule of 2-phosphoglycerate.  2 molecules of 2-Phosphoglycerate (C3H5O4P1) + enolase ‚Üí 2 molecules of phosphoenolpyruvic acid (PEP) (C3H3O3P1)   Step 10  The enzyme pyruvate kinase transfers a P from PEP to ADP to form pyruvic acid and ATP. This happens for each molecule of PEP. This reaction yields 2 molecules of pyruvic acid and 2 ATP molecules.  2 molecules of PEP (C3H3O3P1) + pyruvate kinase + 2 ADP ‚Üí 2 molecules of pyruvic acid (C3H4O3) + 2 ATP Summary In summary, a single glucose molecule in glycolysis produces a total of 2 molecules of pyruvic acid, 2 molecules of ATP, 2 molecules of NADH and 2 molecules of water.   Although 2 ATP molecules are used in steps 1-3, 2 ATP molecules are generated in step 7 and 2 more in step 10. This gives a total of 4 ATP molecules produced. If you subtract the 2 ATP molecules used in steps 1-3 from the 4 generated at the end of step 10, you end up with a net total of 2 ATP molecules produced. ",491,87,0,0,1,1,‚Üî

Le pont est travers√©e par la Route bleue (RD213).  L'ouvrage m√©tallique hauban√© mesure 720 m√®tres et l'ensemble des ouvrages avec les viaducs d'acc√®s repr√©sente une longueur totale de 3 356 m√®tres.

Avec sa trav√©e centrale de 404 m, l'ouvrage m√©tallique de 720 m d√©tenait √† sa construction le record mondial de port√©e pour un pont m√©tallique hauban√©.  En 1992, le conseil g√©n√©ral de la Loire-Atlantique a pris le contr√¥le de la SAEM du pont de Saint-Nazaire concessionnaire de la construction et de l'exploitation de l'ouvrage. L'acc√®s au pont devient gratuit par suppression du p√©age le 1er octobre 1994.  L'ouvrage a √©t√© vers√© au patrimoine routier du conseil g√©n√©ral de la Loire-Atlantique qui en assure la gestion et l'entretien depuis le 1er ao√ªt 1995. Depuis sa cr√©ation les √©changes entre le nord et le sud estuaire se sont consid√©rablement d√©velopp√©s. Caract√©ristiques et construction  L'ouvrage est constitu√© de deux viaducs d'acc√®s en b√©ton pr√©contraint de 1 115 m au Nord et de 1 521 m au Sud, et d'un ouvrage principal m√©tallique hauban√© de 720 m de longueur. Il est emprunt√© par la route d√©partementale RD2131.  La construction du pont a √©t√© confi√©e au groupement d'entreprises1 :      construction m√©tallique : compagnie fran√ßaise d'entreprises m√©talliques (CFEM) ;     ouvrages b√©ton : soci√©t√© g√©n√©rale d'entreprises (SGE) (les fondations ont √©t√© sous-trait√©es aux entreprises Morillon-Corvol, Courbot et Dodin).  Viaduc en b√©ton de type VIPP  Viaduc ind√©pendant √† poutres pr√©contraintes (VIPP)1 :      22 trav√©es au nord et 30 trav√©es au sud, de 50,70 m√®tres de port√©e ;     208 poutres pr√©contraintes de 2,80 m de hauteur et de 190 tonnes ;     une largeur de hourdis de 13,5 m entre garde-corps offrant 12 m de largeur roulable (utilis√©e en 3 voies routi√®res), et deux passages de services de 0,75 m ;     des pentes longitudinales de 5,6 %.  Montage1   Fabrication au sol des poutres, puis transport par fardier, et lan√ßage au moyen d'un lanceur m√©tallique permettant le ripage transversal. Ouvrage principal m√©tallique      Un caisson m√©tallique hauban√© de 720 m de long et d'une hauteur de 3,20 m, en 3 trav√©es de 158 m, 404 m et 158 m, pr√©sentant une dalle orthotrope de 15 m de large ;     Un tirant d'air de 61 m au-dessus des plus basses eaux, sur 300 m de largeur ;     72 haubans, (de type c√¢bles clos) en 4 nappes en √©ventails, fix√©s √† deux pyl√¥nes m√©talliques en V invers√©s, articul√©s en pied, et dont la t√™te se situe sensiblement √† 130 m au-dessus des plus basses eaux1.  Montage1       Fabrication des deux tron√ßons de 96 m de chaque trav√©e de rive, approvisionn√©s par voie maritime depuis l'usine de Fos, par le d√©troit de Gibraltar ;     Assemblage sur deux barges de chaque trav√©e de rive sur 192 m de longueur (avec porte-√†-faux de 34 m en trav√©e centrale) ;     Hissage du caisson assembl√© et de chaque pyl√¥ne couch√©, par cr√©maill√®res et v√©rins ;     Relevage des pyl√¥nes ;     Hissages successifs en trav√©e centrale des tron√ßons de 16 m et mise en place et r√©glage √† l'avancement des haubans ;     Clavage.  Piles Pyl√¥ne      Les piles courantes (52, non compris 2 cul√©es) sont constitu√©es de deux f√ªts en forme de H de 3 m √† 57 m de hauteur, reposant sur une semelle fond√©e sur quatre pieux de 1,80 m ou 1,50 m de diam√®tre.     Deux piles principales de part et d'autre du chenal, sont creuses et form√©es de quatre cellules verticales fond√©es sur un groupe de 18 pieux de diam√®tre 1,80 m.     L'ensemble des pieux en b√©ton arm√© tub√©s et ancr√©s au rocher (environ 260) ont une longueur variable de 15 √† 50 m.  Les piles ont √©t√© construites par coffrages glissants1. Conditions de circulation  La vitesse y est limit√©e √† 70 km/h. La circulation peut √™tre interdite √† certains v√©hicules voire √† tous par grand vent.  Le Conseil g√©n√©ral a mis en place un syst√®me de gestion des voies du pont, qui permet au fil de la journ√©e ou en fonction d'√©v√®nements ponctuels, de consacrer une deuxi√®me voie au sens de circulation le plus sollicit√©. Ce syst√®me se traduit par des barri√®res de rabattement, des plots lumineux de couleur rouge incrust√©s dans le rev√™tement et des portiques supportant des panneaux signal√©tiques lumineux (fl√®che verte/orange ou croix rouge) pour indiquer le sens de circulation affect√© √† chacune des trois voies.  Unique en France, ce syst√®me est entr√© en service le 25 ao√ªt 2010 et est consid√©r√© comme ""exp√©rimental""2. En effet, cela est une exigence des services de l‚Äô√âtat car le code de la route pr√©voit une signalisation blanche au sol. Le conseil g√©n√©ral de Loire Atlantique √† donc re√ßu une autorisation pour 1 an, avec une possible reconduction.  Deux points3 sont n√©anmoins √† am√©liorer :      Le balisage lumineux car les LEDs sont trop fragiles.     L'intensification du trafic pendant la saison estivale qui, malgr√© ce nouveau syst√®me, provoque de nombreux bouchons.  Sport  Ce pont est la difficult√© non naturelle majeure existante dans des courses cyclistes. Ainsi, elle constitue la seule c√¥te dont l'origine n'est pas naturelle √† √™tre r√©pertori√©e lorsqu'elle est franchie (en 4√®me cat√©gorie) sur la route du Tour de France.

t5_2qplv,chowder88,1336507331,"Epic post dude! I feel just the same about this change.  This conflict always shows up in my worldview: Change the system from the inside or the outside?   IN: Speak their language, wear their clothing, laugh at their jokes, but never forget why you got there in the first place. Play the game as close to the line as possible without stepping out. You will eventually come out as a different person. But at least you managed to do that bit of change. Was it worth it?  OUT: Do your own thing. Be as close to your true nature as possible. Create new ways of growing food, providing shelter, etc. New ways of inter-human relationships and politics. Then just stand back and watch it grow.  The truth is that the solution is somewhere in the middle. We need *both*. We need people climbing the monster and poking it's eyes, getting lots of shit on their hands while doing so. But also we need people at the ground level, building a nice fluffy mattress for the monster to fall on.   Just observe where exactly in this game you stand, then *act*! If you have your hands already dirty, finish the god-damned job! If you were too lazy even start climbing it, at least help building the mattress. Bit by  bit.   All of the boundaries that were dissolved in the last ~50 years (gays, blacks, women) were achieved so quickly because the validity of their statement was unarguable. That's why I feel so hopeful for the future. The validity of the MDMA experience [in a proper set and setting(but even if not)] is something that no one will be able to take away. And also the power behind the drug experiences (and ultimately of the human mind), is what makes me think that change is closer than we might expect.   I am a Terence McKenna boy, but not too sure about the I-Ching and all that mumbo-jumbo. However, the exponential rate at which everything is changing/advancing is *not* debatable. It is happening. Just in the same manner that someone from 1900's could not even dream about the change in the following 100 years, we have to realize that it's gonna be just the same for us, just exponentially faster. And it is going to be a surprise for many. The end of this year seems to soon? I dont know...But let's not just wait and see.  Anyway, it seems I also was a bit carried away... And yes, I should be working now too.   ‚ô• for all.   ",1489,2477,0,0,0,1,‚ô•

t5_2qlqh,metamatic,1336515848,"Going [straight to the source](http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20120425005703/en/Sprint-Nextel-Reports-Quarter-2012-Results):  ""Sprint recorded more than 1.5 million iPhone¬Æ sales in the first quarter with 44 percent going to new customers.""  OK, so 660,000 new iPhone customers, 840,000 existing customers upgrading to an iPhone.  ""Approximately 8 percent of Sprint platform postpaid customers upgraded their handsets during the first quarter"", ""...total ending subscribers [was] a record 56 million."" ""...total net subscriber additions of nearly 1.1 million""  Take the 56 million at the end, remove the 1.1 million, multiply by 8%, gives 4,392,000. Subtract the 840,000 of those that were iPhone sales, and that's 3,552,000 non-iPhone phone upgrades sold.  Now take the 1.1 million new customers. We know 660,000 of those were new iPhone customers from our first calculation, so 440,000 were non-iPhone new customers.  So: New customer phone sales - iPhone 660,000 vs non-iPhone 440,000. Existing customer upgrades - iPhone 840,000 vs non-iPhone 3,640,000.  Now, notice what Business Insider does when it discusses the Sprint numbers:  &gt; At Sprint it activated 1.5 million iPhones, or 60% of all smartphones for the quarter  They start out by taking the new customer activation numbers, and indeed about 60% of those were iPhones.  &gt; If Apple accounted for 63% of 80% of the smartphone sales on those carriers, then it had 50% of the total smartphone market in the U.S. in the first quarter of the year.  But it didn't. Apple had 63% of the _new subscriber activations_. That's only a tiny fraction of the handset sales, as we can see from the numbers teased out of the Sprint press release.  For the iPhone to be 60% of smartphones sold at Sprint, Android upgrade sales would need to be 40/60 * 840,000 = 560,000, leaving 3.1 million people upgrading to non-smartphones. Or putting it another way, if BI's numbers are correct, only 38% of upgraders picked any kind of smartphone, while we know 60% of new subscribers picked iPhones, let alone how many picked Android. Those two numbers seem a bit unlikely in combination.  I dunno, maybe I've missed something, but it looks to me as if BI took a massive unsupported leap from ""60% of new subscriber activations"" to ""60% of phones sold"".",16072,3466,0,0,1,1,¬Æ

This happens on a regular basis in my company, and the people in charge of that project are usually happy to see that the latest version fixes deep core bugs. This is always better than having to debug or rewrite tons of critical stuff in their modules.  But except for that specific case, Apache is a very mature project : sticking to 2.2 is **good enough¬©**, performances and features-wise.  For Linux + Apache + Mysql + PHP, my rule of thumb is to stick to stable. Unstable and testing versions are usually not worth the trouble.

But anyway, this bottom section of the page is the code you need:      body {         background: url(http://thumbs.reddit.com/t5_2qjt4_8.png) no-repeat fixed center center         }   Replace the URL with the image you upload from the stylesheet editing page (will give you the URL there).  Anyway, no need to reinvent the wheel if you just want to get rolling. (ha ha! Wheel puns.) Look around for the stuff you want to do, steal it, tweak it, credit it if you're feeling charitable, and just have fun!  If I have one common-sense tip (as in, I don't know why I didn't do it myself earlier), it's this: make yourself a little test subreddit you can try things out on, especially if your sub already has subscribers. That way you don't throw a wrench in the works and kinda throw everything off while people are trying to use it.  Good luck!",3892,4466,0,0,1,1,¬Æ

t5_2rtff,HINDBRAIN,1336639419,"Okay. There are tons of complexities I am not getting into, either because explaining would take too much time or that I lack knowledge.  In programming, strings are basically arrays of characters. Sometimes they have additional shit (in C they are just a sequence of characters with a '\0' at the end, in C++ they also have methods and such for easier manipulation, and I'm not getting into encoding).  If you look at the [function prototype,](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/clibrary/cstring/strstr/)             char * strstr (       char * str1, const char * str2 );  You will notice that this returns a pointer to a character (the first char *). You can consider this more or less the address of a character in your RAM.  The arguments of the function are also pointers to characters: as this is a C function in this case, it takes C strings. In this case, you simply input the address of the first character of the sequence.   Suppose you pass it an adress and it reads a character there, in this case 'v'. Your memory from this address looks like that:      'v' 'i' 'd' 'y' 'a' '\0' 'e' 'o' '‚ô™' 'p' etc  It will iterate from the 'v' until it encounters the '\0'. What comes after the '\0' is random shit from elsewhere, so make extra sure you are not reading there when you are coding. (it could crash, or worse, not crash and give a wrong result).    Then, supposing you gave it valid addresses, it will search for the contents of the sequence stored starting from str2 into the contents of the sequence stored into str1. It does this with a lot of loops and tests basically.  Suppose you have this at the adress str1:  'v' 'i' 'd' 'y' 'a' '\0' 'e' 'o' '‚ô™' 'p' etc  and this at the adress str2:  'd' 'y' '\0' 'j' '¬ß' 'p' '*' '‚ò∫'  etc  it will iterate until it finds ""dy"" at the adress str1 + 2, and return str1 + 2. Why str1 + 2? Because str1 is a char pointer, and you moved forward by 2 chars (the ""unit"" of the pointer if you will). A char is often one byte, by the way.  Then you could for instance write this:      printf(""%s"",str1+2); //meaning ""print the string at str1 + 2      It would display ""dya"".      printf(""%c"",str1+2); //meaning ""print the character at str1 + 2      Would display ""d"" because you are only asking for the character at that address.  strstr will return a null pointer if the string is not found, which is what I use in my pseudo code. || means ""OR"". [something not null] OR [something] is always [something not null] in C (probably 1 but I can't be bothered to check). The if will proceed to its nested instructions if you feed it something not null. Meaning if the comment or its parent contains ""Ron"", the bot will proceed and downvote.  This is assuming comment-&gt;contents is a c string; but it's usually easy to convert stuff into c strings (for instance, in c++, you could use comment-&gt;contents.c_str()   )",127394,19710,0,0,1,1,‚ò∫

t5_2qhkh,pour_some_sugar,1336696035,"Apparently there concerns about Glyphosate staying in the ground and causing residual damage.   [Here's an article about Purdue Professor Emeritus Don Huber and his letter to US Agriculture secretary Vilsack that was leaked](http://www.greenpasture.org/fermented-cod-liver-oil-butter-oil-vitamin-d-vitamin-a/more-on-glyphosate---don-hubers-warning-to-vilsack-and-his-cover-letter/)  The article contains paragraphs such as this: &gt;Increased severity of plant diseases after glyphosate is applied (Fig. 3) is well documented and, although rarely cited, the increased disease susceptibility is the herbicidal mode of action of glyphosate (Johal andRahe,1988, 1990; Johal and Huber, 2009; Schafer et al, 2009, 2010). The loss of disease resistance in Roundup Ready¬Æ sugar beets when glyphosate was applied prompted researchers at the USDA sugar beet laboratory to include a precautionary statement in their paper, e.g. ‚ÄúPrecautions need to be taken when certain soil-borne diseases are present if weed management for sugar beet is to include post-emergence glyphosate treatments‚Äù (Larson et al, 2006).  I have no personal opinion on glyphosate, just happened to see the news about increasing concern of residual effects recently.   This explains how the increased plant diseases come about:  &gt;Extensive research has shown that this potent tool for weed management, glyphosate, is also a strong immobilizer (chelator) of essential plant nutrients to impair nutrient uptake, translocation, and physiological efficiency at only a fraction of the labeled herbicidal rate (Ekers, Ozturk, Cakmak, Zobiole, Jolly et al., 2004). Glyphosate is a powerful biocide to harm beneficial soil organisms important for nutrient recycling, N-fixation, nutrient availability, and natural disease control (Kremer &amp; Means, Zobiole et al, Dick et al) with a resultant increase in diseases of corn, soybeans (Fig. 3), wheat and other crops. The close relationship between mineral nutrition and disease severity is well documented (Datnoff et al, 2007). These activities can have deleterious effects on plant nutrition, disease susceptibility, and nutritional quality of the crop produced.",6106,1,0,0,0,1,¬Æ

t5_2qk72,the_birds_and_bees,1336729494,"&gt;...Spectra and Dyneema webbing are so slippery that they cannot hold a knot and need to be sewn closed.  That is in reference to the fact that you shouldn't tie your own dyneema slings with a water knot. It doesn't apply to all knots.  &gt;Tying a knot in a Dyneema¬Æ sling weakens it [...] leading to sling failure in a fall-factor 1 loading on to a 120 cm sling.  &gt;Tying knots in Dyneema webbing was proven to have reduced the total amount of supported force by as much as half.  True of any webbing or cordage.  The full quote from the wikipedia page is as follows:  &gt; It is also important to note that only nylon can be safely knotted into a runner (usually using a water knot or beer knot), Dyneema is always sewn because the fibers are too slippery to hold a knot under weight.  This is in the context of tying your own slings with a water knot and doesn't apply to knots in general.  &gt;Dyneema/Spectra doesn‚Äôt hold a knot. Never use a knot with Dyneema/Spectra.  This quote is taken from an article about re slinging cams, again the context is tying your own slings with dyneema, not knots in general.  &gt;I did however find a couple companies that made a blended webbing of Dyneema and nylon that was stronger and lighter than nylon, but still able to hold a knot. Unfortunately I didn't see any of that sold in the US.  All climbing slings are a dyneema/nylon blend. For whatever reason it currently isn't possible to make pure dyneema slings. You can check this yourself, dyneema doesn't take a dye so if you look at a 'dyneema' sling the white bits are dyneema and the coloured bits are nylon.",5979,2933,0,0,1,1,¬Æ

Like you said psychopathy is when you don't feel guilt for what you have done nor will you but that doesn't mean they don't care about themselfs so with this logic I can see a psychopath staying a cold calculated person but still cares on how he impacts others, not because he cares about them but because he cares about how it will effect him. This logic can be summed up into if treat others like crap it's counter productive and it always makes it harder for yourself in the long run, why make it harder on your self. If you can show them the logic of operating this way not only will it make life easier but they will treat others in a more appropriate way.(Again not because they care about others but because they care about how others can impact them)     Thanks for reading my useless opinion.  üëç",25587,671,0,0,1,1,üëç

t5_2qpp6,Holy__Check,1336846289,"Patch 1.5 ‚Äì The StarCraft II Arcade Arrives  Major changes are coming to StarCraft II with patch 1.5.0. The menu screen will be split into two distinct areas, and each will be focused on a distinct experience. The StarCraft II section will be where players go for head to head ladder competition, as well as custom games focused on traditional StarCraft II gameplay, such as melee maps and micro trainers. Meanwhile, the new Arcade section will the place where the community can find and play the vast array of custom games that explore the many possibilities of the StarCraft II editor. From tower defense to RPGs and beyond, the Arcade will bring your creations to players around the world. We want the Arcade to offer the best experience possible, so we‚Äôre making changes to improve everything from the interface to the editor itself. Your input can help us refine it even further. Here are some of the improvements we already have planned:  Global Changes  ¬∑ Added StarCraft II &amp; Arcade as game Types  o Creators define which basic type best fits the game that they have created. Each game will only appear in either StarCraft II or the Arcade.  ¬∑ Game Genres   o We‚Äôve used community feedback and the existing game list to create a comprehensive menu of genres for creators to choose from. Now players will have tools to more easily find the games they are looking for, which in turn gives creators an easy way to find their audience.  Arcade  ¬∑ Game Presentation  o Browsing ¬ß Browsing for games is a totally new experience. Players can search for games based on genre, over all popularity, star rating, newness, and recent spikes in popularity.  o Game Icons ¬ß The game icon contains a large game image (provided by the creator), the game‚Äôs name, and star rating. Hovering over the icon displays the game description.  o Game Info page  ¬ß Clicking on a game icon brings players into the Game Info page, a section devoted entirely to showing off what a game is all about, providing play instructions, and revealing other important information about the game.  ¬ß All the content in Game Info is under control of the game creator, except for reviews.  ¬ß Joining public matches and creating private games is done from the Game Info page. This will be the portal players return to again and again to play the game.  ¬ß Game Info contains these sections:  ¬∑ Overview: This will contain the game description, as well as screenshots that show off the action.  ¬∑ How to Play: This is where players will find the Basic Instructions, How to Win, and Advanced Instructions sections. This is also useful space for additional images to help players understand how to enjoy your creation.  ¬∑ Patch Notes: You‚Äôre able to update patch notes as often as you like, so players can see how the game is growing and improving.  ¬∑ Reviews: After playing, players can give your game a star rating and enter a text review. Once enough ratings are provided, your game gets an Average Star Rating. Players can also mark each other‚Äôs reviews as ‚ÄúHelpful‚Äù which will ensure that the best reviews rise to the top.  ¬∑ Tutorial support  o Creators can now publish tutorials. This is a powerful way to introduce new players and give them a place to learn the ropes before they dive in.  o A ‚ÄúPlay Tutorial‚Äù button appears on the Game Info page if a tutorial exists.

Then you can configure your main game to point to the tutorial.",374,498,0,0,0,1,¬Æ

Here is a copy and paste of how to reuse purigen.  Regeneration: Purigen¬Æ can also be regenerated. As it adsorbs waste products, Purigen¬Æ will change color from a pale blonde to a dark brown, almost black. Once it is exhausted, it can be regenerated with a solution of bleach and water. The bleach will literally ‚Äúburn off‚Äù the organics that have been removed from the tank. Watch out for products that claim to be regenerable with a brine solution. That is the regeneration procedure for ion-exchange purposes. A brine solution will not remove organics. While such resins have a limited capacity for organic adsorption, a brine regeneration process only replaces removed ionic compounds. It does not destroy large organic molecules that were removed, which is the primary function of organic adsorption resins",3800,960,0,0,1,1,¬Æ

Here's the boiler-plate response I got from them when I contacted them:  Hi ----,  Thanks for your interest in having Pandora on Windows Phone 7. We are not developing an app at this time, but we will definitely keep it in mind while planning our product priorities for the future.  We know that our recent release has broken most unsupported Pandora clients, and we do apologize for the surprise and inconvenience that undoubtedly caused to your listening experience. At a basic level, third-party applications are violating our Terms of Use and are obviously not authorized to sell (or give away) something that fundamentally derives its value from our product.  Beyond the boilerplate, though, the fact is that--while the use you are writing in about seems designed mainly to help folks listen to Pandora in their own way--some folks do use third-party unsupported client libraries in a harmful way, and so we make changes when we need to prevent this. Regrettably, we have no way of targeting changes towards some unsupported clients and not others--some are respectful of our business, but unfortunately we can't tell them from those that are not.   Even disregarding attempts at malicious use, we do of course still have to continue to upgrade our software, and unsupported clients have been broken by these sorts of routine changes many times in the past as well. We definitely do recognize that our actions limit the options available to well-intentioned listeners who do not want to use any of our endorsed clients, and we're genuinely sorry for the inconvenience this brings to our enthusiastic listeners like yourself!   We really appreciate your support of the service and respect the DIY spirit, but our hand has been forced on this issue. Thanks so much for your understanding, and thanks again for reaching out.

I can‚Äôt say definitively that someone molested me as a young child I have blocked a whole lot! But I have these disturbing memories of things that took place with neighbors, that seem out of body to myself and for the most part I just remember only pieces.  So I don‚Äôt like to say yeah someone did something to me.  Besides that, there were so many other exposers to sexual things at such a young age. they still effect myself and my sexual relationship with my husband today.  The lack of parenting on my parents part lead to myself being a high school drop out, a teen mother, and just straight nieve and stupid at times looking for love in all the wrong places.  Which led to so much difficulty as an adult to cope and act in a normal manner.  I am 30 years old now and I‚Äôm so angry at my past. I feel like a life wasted at times, the potential I would have had if only I could have known I would grow up soon and everything would be cool. Presently I take it one day at a time trying to stay happy. It is easy to fall into  the couch and be depressed for myself. I am also a mother so I try to find peace by knowing my children won't end up like me and as long as they grow up and make it I think I will be happy indefinitely some day.

t5_2qh1i,EricTheHalibut,1337068372,"The usual form of the argument is that women have the choice, after conception, to abort the child, and that therefore, at least in more progressive countries where abortion is cheap or free-at-the-point-of-use, and socially acceptable, she is carrying it to term because she wants to. That means that, since it is entirely her choice, the entire burden for the consequences of that choice should fall on her.   This, of course, raises a few questions:  1. How do we make sure the child is adequately funded? 1. How do we limit it, so that a woman can decide whether or not to become a mother with confidence? 1. What rights does the child have to know the identity of the father? 1. What if the man opts-out, but then either comes back or hangs around and acts like a father without actually having any legal responsibility? 1. What about the cost of abortion, plus travel, unpaid time off, and any complications that may arise?  There are probably a few others, but those are the ones I've seen often. There are, of course, many different answers to these questions, but those are mine:  1. Do whatever is done when the father is unknown, broke, dead, or cannot pay for some other reason. If we presume that many of the men who opt out are those who would be ""deadbeat dads"" under the current system, it probably wouldn't cost any more because while there might well be more men, there isn't the cost of chasing them. Also, it would mean the prospective mother knows that only state assistance will be available, which might discourage her from having the child at all. 1. IMO, based on the social norms of my own society, the decision should be made before sex, and be opt-in if there is no marriage or de-facto relationship and opt-out otherwise (that reflects that here, people would assume the mother will abort if there is no relationship and probably keep it if there is). That way, everyone knows where they stand, and there is no delay looking for the man and asking him what he plans to do. I'd suggest some form contract like:     &gt; I,  [man's name], accept joint parental rights and responsibilities for any and all offspring of myself and [woman's name] (hereafter referred to as ""the mother""),  under the terms of $ACT.  &gt;  &gt; ‚òë provided there is no indication of congenital deformities or disabling genetic disorders [space for both to initial]  &gt;  &gt;‚òë I request full custody in the event that any or all of the aforementioned children become wards of the state. [space to initial]  &gt;  &gt; [Signatures]    Obviously, the wording isn't all that critical, but you get the idea. Clearly, the required level of sobriety for that to be effective should be exactly the same as that required to consent to sex, although an opt-out version should probably be even simpler so it just requires two signatures on it to be completely valid.   .4. IMO, copy the rules for the parents of adopted children.  .5. Treat him like any other unrelated man - if the mother wants to allow them to meet, all well and good, but if not, he has no rights to resurrect the relationship without the mother's (or, if it is old enough, the child's) agreement.  .6. IMO, in normal circumstances the man should have to pay half if the cost is non-trivial. That is actually a win for unmarried women over the present rules if she doesn't want it, especially in those parts of the US where offering to pay for an abortion counts as accepting responsibility for the kid if she refuses.

t5_2tdzg,kreshtrio,1337099434,"Talking to a friend about charging his new motorcycle battery after he fills it with acid.  &gt;This is from From the Battery Tender Web site FAQ: &gt; &gt;20. Can the Battery Tender Plus successfully perform the initial charge on a new, flooded, motorcycle battery? &gt; &gt;Background: The motorcycle dealers receive batteries from the manufacturer in a dry state. The plates are dried out, and there is no acid in the cell compartments. (Do not confuse this with a dry-cell battery.) The dealer must fill the individual battery cells with acid and then put them on a shop charger to pre-charge prior to selling them to a customer. As the batteries arrive from the manufacturer, the plates are approximately 80% ""formed"". The initial pre-charge, post-formation charge, or more correctly, formation-finishing charge, must be conducted at a specific power level and for a specific time period. Each manufacturer has its own recommendations, for example one manufacturer recommends that the charger deliver a constant current equal to 10% to 15% of the battery amp-hour capacity and that the charge current be applied to the battery for a period of 5 to 10 hours. &gt; &gt;Answer 1) Certainly if the dealer has properly pre-charged the battery after filling it with acid, then the answer is ABSOLUTELY YES. &gt;Answer 2) If the dealer has not properly pre-charged th &gt;e newly filled battery prior to the sale, then the answer is YES, WITH SOME QUALIFICATIONS: &gt; &gt;Qualification A) The Battery Tender¬Æ Plus should be left on the new battery for a minimum of 24 hours on float, in addition to whatever amount of time it takes for the charger to get to the float stage. It is not clear how to correlate the 80% formed plates with a given state of charge once the cells are filled with acid. To be safe, assume that the batteries require a full 100% charge after the cells are filled. &gt; &gt;For example, a 16 Ah battery will take about 13 hours to get to the absorption voltage (constant 14.4 Volts). It may take another 6 to 8 hours to reach the float voltage (constant 13.2 Volts). This may sound awkward; because what happens is that the battery charge current drops while the absorption voltage is held constant. When the battery current drops to 0.1 amp, or if 6 to hours have elapsed at the absorption voltage, the charger automatically switches its output from 14.4 V to 13.2 V. So it may take the better part of 20 hours to reach the float stage. Add another 24 hours to that and you are at 44 hours. Throw in another 4 hours for good measure and you get a nice round, even 48 hours, or 2 days. &gt; &gt;Qualification B) Although there are probably several charging methods that will be equally effective, regardless of who manufactures the battery, in the interests of technical consistency, they will not officially sanction any initial charging method other than those published in their technical applications literature",15,15,0,0,1,1,¬Æ

Disclaimer: I am not a Python programmer at the moment. I don't know what this actually affects, or how to fix it. But here's what Ruby says:      $ irb     1.9.3p125 :001 &gt; 'foo'.encoding.name     =&gt; ""UTF-8""      1.9.3p125 :002 &gt;   Perl is somewhat unwieldy, but the manpage says this:  &gt; If your locale environment variables (LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE, LANG) contain the strings 'UTF-8' or 'UTF8' (case-insensitive matching), the default encoding of your STDIN, STDOUT, and STDERR, and of any subsequent file open, is UTF-8.  And hey, look:      $ echo $LANG     en_US.UTF-8     $  Bash seems to support Unicode well enough:      ~$ cd tmp/     ~/tmp$ touch ‚òÉ     ~/tmp$ ls     ‚òÉ     ~/tmp$ if [ -f ‚òÉ ]; then echo 'snowman!'; fi     snowman!     ~/tmp$ rm ‚òÉ      ~/tmp$   Java keeps strings as unicode internally (UTF-16, I think).  And of course, with JavaScript, you'd have to work hard to get a string into it that isn't already properly Unicode.  But Python... At least on my system, it doesn't seem to like snowmen:       $ irb     1.9.3p125 :001 &gt; ''.encoding.name     =&gt; ""UTF-8""      1.9.3p125 :002 &gt;        ~$ cd tmp/     ~/tmp$ touch ‚òÉ     ~/tmp$ ls      ~/tmp$ rm ‚òÉ      ~/tmp$       $ python     Python 2.7.3 (default, Apr 20 2012, 22:39:59)      [GCC 4.6.3] on linux2     Type ""help"", ""copyright"", ""credits"" or ""license"" for more information.     &gt;&gt;&gt; ‚òÉ = 5       File ""&lt;stdin&gt;"", line 1         ‚òÉ = 5         ^     SyntaxError: invalid syntax     &gt;&gt;&gt; x = 5     &gt;&gt;&gt; x‚òÉ = 5       File ""&lt;stdin&gt;"", line 1         x‚òÉ = 5         ^     SyntaxError: invalid syntax     &gt;&gt;&gt; a‚òÉb       File ""&lt;stdin&gt;"", line 1         a‚òÉb         ^     SyntaxError: invalid syntax     &gt;&gt;&gt; x = '‚òÉ'     &gt;&gt;&gt; x     '\xe2\x98\x83'     &gt;&gt;&gt; print x     ‚òÉ     &gt;&gt;&gt; len(x)     3     &gt;&gt;&gt;   So... maybe you should feel bad? I mean, it's at least handling the text more or less cleanly, so long as you don't have to do any actual processing with it. But that snowman is 3 bytes, not 3 characters. Ruby does the right thing here:      $ irb     1.9.3-p125 :001 &gt; '‚òÉ'.length      =&gt; 1      1.9.3-p125 :002 &gt;   Try these things out.

t5_2tex6,SanityInAnarchy,1337209773,"&gt; ""Character counting"" is the feature that has the least number of real world application, that at the same time is the most commonly cited when speaking of UTF-8.  Mostly, I think, because it's trivial to demonstrate. However, pattern matching, string slicing, and pretty much anything else I might want to do with a string other than shuffle it around and print it, all need proper Unicode support. I suppose there are some use cases where I could treat it as ASCII and pretend it's   &gt; Firstly, what characters do you want to count? Abstract characters (code points) or user-perceived characters (grapheme clusters)?  Clearly, *neither* of these is being done in Python, and both measures would agree that ‚òÉ is one character. (It's a snowman.)  &gt; Counting the number of code units, on the other hand, is useful. It answers the question ""how much memory this string occupies"" and this is the quantity used to limit the sizes of, e.g., fields in some database.  This depends on the database and the application. For example, if you've set an arbitrarily low limit on some field, do you tell the user ""Your username must be capable of being stored in 8 to 16 bytes"", or ""Your username must be 8-16 characters long""? The latter is at least consistent from the user's point of view.  This is also consistent with the actual usage of the 'length' operation. In Python, the 'len' function returns the number of items in an array, which corresponds neither to the number of bytes taken up by the references to these items (this is probably 64 bits per item) nor the number of bytes taken up by the objects themselves (depends very much on the type of object). Were I to split a string into ""words"" and stuff these into an array, the length of that array in *any* language corresponds not to the number of bytes in the string, but the number of words.  In fact, it's hard to think of anywhere except C and filesystem APIs where the exact number of bits or bytes in an object is directly exposed to the developer. It may be strongly implied (byte arrays in Java, say), and the language spec may even say how large certain items are, but there's no equivalent to the ""length"" operation on a string for measuring bytes.  So it seems much more likely to me that string length as a measure of either code points or characters (and one that's broken when every string is assumed to be ASCII) than as a measure of bytes.",160563,262,0,0,1,1,‚òÉ

A friend of mine left a toxic place and took a significant pay cut, he's so much happier. clif notes version: The bosses would throw 6-figure bonuses at him to entice him to perform even greater miracles on even shorter time/budgets, all the while threatening to fire him if he's over said time/budgets.

Its not about what is best, it is about making the best of the rules presented.  F1 is a puzzle, and you need to solve it.  The rules state the car can have more than one MGU.   This is the rule in regards to coupling the MGU and turbocharger:  &gt; 5.1.6 Pressure charging may only be effected by the use of a sole single stage compressor linked to a  sole single stage exhaust turbine by a common shaft parallel to the engine crankshaft and  within 25mm of the car centre line. An electrical motor generator (MGUH) may be directly  coupled to the same shaft.  Both the turbo and the crank can have their own MGU (MGUH/MGUK).  &gt;5.2.7 The MGUK may only recover energy from or give back energy to the car via its mechanical link  to the drive train. This mechanical link must be of fixed speed ratio to the engine crankshaft  and may be clutched. 2014 F1 Technical Regulations 22 / 77 14 July 2011  ¬© 2011 F√©d√©ration Internationale de l‚ÄôAutomobile   &gt;5.2.8 The MGUH may only recover energy from or give back energy to the car via its mechanical link  to the exhaust turbine of a pressure charging system. This mechanical link must be of fixed  speed ratio to the exhaust turbine and **may be clutched**  The cars only have one turbo, but are still going to be acting as a TC (Turbo Compound) motor in many ways.  In a TC engine, the second turbo scavenges either unused exhaust gasses, or unused energy from a shaft on the 1st turbo that drives the second.  They can be parallel, or series.  The MGUH will still scavenge unused energy from the turbo and feed it back into the engine mechanically.  Pretty cool stuff.  This is where I got the info, the rules.  Looking over the rules its hard to imagine everyone coming out with identical engines outside of basic configuration.  The power should be more instant now, and have a wider range of torque due to the turbo being able to make up for the lower torque in the lower revs.  Now the engine will do well in the lower revs, and as you said, start to see diminishing returns once about 10,500.  I've read a lot people think it will voluntarily redline at 12,000 just to give it more legs in some corners, giving the driver the choice to use the engine or the gears, possibly handy in DRS situations where there should not longer be issues of hitting the limiter.  Having less power is better than bouncing off a limiter.",106783,12774,0,0,1,1,¬©

t5_2qi58,v0lta_7,1337292674,"&gt; And if you see the 3 goals conceded by Barca against Chelsea, Real and Chelsea; all three came from the area where Abidal used to defend.  What? Abidal defends runs by left midfielders? (1st goal, Ramires's run). 2nd goal, yes, it was his position, but no left back would've stopped that run and/or finish. And how was Abidal not being there involved in the 3rd goal? It was a free bloody run from Torres with every Barcelona player near the Chelsea box due to the urgency of the situation.   You're simply saying stuff assuming I don't know what I'm talking about. Please research your matter carefully.  &gt;And it was clear that Xavi was playing with an injury to his Achilles.  No it wasn't.  &gt;And regarding strategy and so on, I personally don't believe it was nothing ingenious or resolute.  Do you mean to say it wasn't ingenious or resolute or that it was? I can't figure out if that is bad grammar or simply double negatives.  &gt;the only player that seem to give a fuck in Chelsea was Joe Cole  I...what?

Ashley Cole, probably THE most determined player out there. Our other defenders, facing a constant barrage of attacks and all of them playing out of position. Drogba and Lampard, seasoned veterans who would never even think of giving up. Ramires, who was one of the brightest out there. I can go on and on and on! Chelsea would've conceded 4-5 if they didn't give a fuck.  &gt;Then that one goal right before the halftime completely changed the mentality and after the penalty miss it almost looked like a given.

And Chelsea took advantage of that complacency. Rightly so.  &gt;That played a decisive factor as I think.

(1st goal, Ramires's run). 2nd goal, yes, it was his position, but no left back would've stopped that run and/or finish. And how was Abidal not being there involved in the 3rd goal? It was a free bloody run from Torres with every Barcelona player near the Chelsea box due to the urgency of the situation.  You sound surprised about this which means you do no watch as many Barca games in La Liga. Their greatest strength is their fluidity and without key players it can become their greatest weakness. In the first Chelsea goal, Xavi had to track back Ramires after Messi lost the ball in the center as Alves was nowhere near defense, Masche slipped but you could see Adriano still running behind Drogba. Now Adriano is just like Alves-who likes to play a lot more attacking and stays way higher then Abidal would have stayed. And Abidal believe it or not can be faster then Adriano and has much better positional awareness then Adriano. So that is why I said the first goal could've been prevented by Abidal's presence. By second goal I mean to say the Ronaldo goal that Barca conceded against Madrid, so apologies for the confusion. And the first Chelsea goal was a fuck up by Masche who forgot they were playing a three man defense when he came to get the ball off Lampard. To suggest no left back could have stopped that run and/or finish is simply your assumption and I won't say anything about it. Third goal was not intended in any discussion.  &gt;No it wasn't.  Xavi's Achilles tendon flared up around February and he rarely played full game or had the same intensity training. Right before the Madrid match they were not sure if he would start and the decision was made an hour or so ago when he played till the 70th minute. So he was nowhere near at his best in any of the games against Chelsea or the one against Madrid and he was rested until the last Liga game after the loss to Chelsea (about 2 and half weeks)  &gt;Do you mean to say it wasn't ingenious or resolute or that it was? I can't figure out if that is bad grammar or simply double negatives.  Both. The parking the bus strategy is nothing new. Switzerland used it against Spain, Mou's Inter against Barca or Chelsea against Barca or Arsenal against Barca or the lesser team in Liga or even the double trivote of Madrid against Barca. It was not resolute simply because Chelsea had to rely on Barca finishing badly rather than Chelsea being airtight. In terms of resoluteness, the display at SB on 2009 was much better because Barca simply had one shot on target which ended up being the goal or Inter at Camp Nou.   &gt;I...what? Mate I don't even know whether I should carry on this debate. Joe Cole left Chelsea FC as of 30th June 2010. And every single player in the squad gave a fuck. Cech, still making great saves. Ashley Cole, probably THE most determined player out there. Our other defenders, facing a constant barrage of attacks and all of them playing out of position. Drogba and Lampard, seasoned veterans who would never even think of giving up. Ramires, who was one of the brightest out there. I can go on and on and on! Chelsea would've conceded 4-5 if they didn't give a fuck.  Okey that was a honest mistake. So no need to freak out. I mean Ashley Cole and as I did not review the comment; it just slipped by. And what I mean by not giving a flying fuck was that after Terry was gone, Chelsea had lost their shape which lead to the second goal and then lead to the Ramires yellow (which he blamed on nerves) while Drogba simply kicked the ball towards the corner line when they had to restart play. And at one point, only Ashley Cole was trying to get the ball off the Barca player which made the ITV commentators to say that he seems to be the only game who has not lost it. But after the Ramires goal everybody gave a fuck of course. My reference was especially after the Terry red and the second Barca goal.  &gt;Are you kidding me? So you're saying that despite Barca being 1. in front of 95k of their own on their home ground 2. Playing against a team with no CBs 3. Playing against a team with 10 men 4. Having 50+ minutes to salvage the match It was a given that they were going to lose? Is that all the mental strength 'The Best team in the World¬Æ' has? A squad composed of La Liga, CL, Euro, World Cup winners?  1. The home crowd were completely subdued after the first Chelsea goal and after the miss by Leo, it was all panic rather than anything I have heard time and again from the crowd at Camp Nou (except for moments; when they knew it was inevitable, they even said Torres name) but fair enough.   2.3. Having no CBs did not really mattered much against Barca as they have no one player who stays in the middle of the box waiting for a long ball against or takes shots from outside the box. Having a player like Bosingwa who is agile actually helped and in any case, when Drogba becomes one of the defenders along with 10 fit and determined players who simply want to hoof the ball away, it clearly becomes a disadvantage against team like Barca. Again Chelsea did what they have to do, but this is what teams have been doing all along and sometimes it works, sometimes does not.  4. Technically they did create the chance which led to a penalty but then Leo hit the post. After that it was 25 minutes to salvage the game, Leo hit the post again around the end.   The given was part of my observation and nothing to do with the mental strength/weakness of the Barca team. The reason I came to the conclusion is many but the main ones were the way they conceded the first goal and the lack of run from Messi after the penalty miss as well as the constant pass-back between Xavi and Busi (who completed more passes between them in the second half then the whole Chelsea team passes over the game). And with the lack of goal threat from anyone except Leo and Leo not making those runs and then hitting the post were some reasons that led me to the conclusion. They looked exhausted (which they were physically as they had 2 days rest) as well as mentally.   &gt;So you're basically saying Barcelona is composed of weak minded players who give up at the slightest sign of trouble and become complacent at the slightest sign of a lead.  No I am not 'basically saying' that Barca players have are psychological weak. They have been guilty of complacency at certain points during the season which Pep and the players as well as observers have noticed possibly because except the failure against Inter, they really had not faced another epic failure under Pep. So they seemed to be lacking the urgency and simply could not give as much as they would have done if they had not won the CL twice already (which the Chelsea players showed). That may be simply due to the complete exhaustion or lack of ideas in breaking down the 10 men wall while hitting the post/missing penalties. That does play a factor when your team has 27 odd SOT and can score only two while the opponent has 2 from 5 odd SOT. And I assume a team that has come from the behind many times against teams like RM to beat them is not that psychologically weak.   You seem to be thinking I am taking the due credit away from Chelsea. I am not. But I have no qualms in stating that I will not be over the moon if Argentina plays such football even if they win the world cup that way. For most people winning is the only thing that matters, for me the process matters equally. If Chelsea FC is proud of the identity of winning by any means necessary, good for them. The reason I loved the Barca UNDER Pep was that they always played on their terms and the process was equally important as the victory as he stated time and time again.   So to somehow suggest Barca were handed their ass on platter while even when they were loosing is an overstatement. That is all.",896,21,0,0,1,1,¬Æ

Plus, when I play versus people on the ladder, I might not perfect nearly as fast, but I'll learn how to be more versatile with the build. Compared to if I just played against the bots, when I went on the ladder, I might just straight up lose to a bunch of all-ins or certain simple things that I had no idea about because I just played against the bot who does the same thing.  I'm not saying playing against bots are bad. But, I personally just play on an empty map a few times until I can hit key timings, then bring it on the ladder after I have my basic guidelines down. That way I can start losing (you're going to have to lose to learn &lt;_&lt;;; ) and learn what I need to look out for and how to change the build around should I see these things.

Mainly because some characters don't become REALLY fun until act 2, and after I finish awesome-ing my monk, I want to jump strait into the fun part. ANYWAY, here are my questions:  1) The difficulty jump between the end of act 1 and the beginning of act 2 was noticeable, not big, but I can't dick around as easily as I could in act 1. Is the jump between act 2 and 3 about the same? Or is it bigger.  38) The act 1 boss(Final) was disappointing to me. I didn't find him difficult and his appearance and abilities are were only a little cool. Do the final bosses for the other acts get better?  5) The first dyes you see at merchants are kinda limited(not complaining). Do the rest come as you level?

t5_2qi6d,johnny2k,1337320255,"It would help to know what you ride but here's some stuff that helped me on my single-cylinder 650.   Most importantly, you want to make sure all the nuts and bolts are torqued correctly. Loose parts will do a lot to add vibration. A pair of gel grips will also be the first thing you want to pick up if you haven't already done that. My hands used to go numb after a while with the stock grips. This no longer happens thanks to the 1000 pennies I spent. Always wear gloves. Always wear gloves. If, by chance, you ride a KLR you can reduce vibrations by upgrading to a larger piston. This is an added benefit to the solution for curing the oil consumption problem of the '08 and newer machines. There are handle bars that can help with this as well but I know nothing about the options available or what to look for. Mine are still stock.   All the advice you're getting from us is aimed to make sure the resonant frequency of your handle bars is not the same as the engine when at certain RPMs. You mentioned a speed at which you feel it the most. Maybe try to ride at a lower speed but with the same RPM to test this? If that doesn't prove anything maybe it indicates you have a wheel that is unbalanced? Mine was all janked up once so any speed over 55 was like riding a giant Rabbit¬Æ. Have you run your tires at a low air pressure recently? That is what caused mine to become unbalanced.  Check out this article I dug up with my ""resonant frequency motorcycle vibration"" shovel. I didn't read it but maybe it will help you find the solution you need.   http://www.xs11.com/xs11-info/tech-tips/modifications/40/147-how-to-eliminate-handlebar-vibration.html",10651,1004,0,0,1,1,¬Æ

You guys are not married, although that doesn't always make a difference, have only been together for one year, and if something were to happen to the relationship, it would be your name on the mortgage and you being forced to make the payments. A good thought to go by in determining how much house you can afford is to figure out what 3 years of your salary would be, and by my calculations, 3 years of your salary alone would be $240,000.  You guys should talk to your bank because they probably wouldn't finance you even with the large down payment, because of student loans, not being at the job very long, not much established credit, and things like that. I strongly advise young people not to buy a house on a mortgage because of those reasons. It would be an entirely different story if you were able to buy the house with cash.

The Mom was feral and had the kittens in my brother's neighbour's greenhouse. The neighbour moved them at max. two days old (because he thought his own cat might harm them), which is always a *bad* thing to do. He just dumped them on my brother's doorstep and he looked after them until I volunteered to step in. Coincidentally, me and the boyfriend were planning to get rescue cats within the month.  The Momma cat comes into my brother's yard sometimes and they tried to coax her back but have had no luck, so that is why my brother made the decision to move them to my house. The vet I talked to today said that once they are moved, Momma is unlikely to come back :(  Today's update: Brought them to the vet to see if we were taking care of them properly, to check their weight etc. The vet was very happy with how we've looked after them and they're at the weight that they should be! She did say there's a 50/50 survival rate with hand-reared cats BUT she is quietly confident that they will make it because they are currently thriving. They could still come down with an infection and not make it but she said they're very likely to survive once they reach 2 and a half weeks (9-10 days time).

Seeing as you aren't intersted in the ""Cheaper Powerhouses"" which arent as aesthetically appealing, (I'm assuming that means no Clevo/MSI/Sager options) Alienware is totally out of the question unless you're willing to up your budget another $300-$350 dollars.  There's the XPS 15: One of the quickpicks. Your looking at $899, with free shipping, but not including tax.  Comes with $200 ecard to get some accessories with (printers, monitors, headphones, xbox, etc). You're looking at i5 procssing, 1T Hard drive, NVIDIA¬Æ GeForce¬Æ GT 525M 1GB GPU, 6 Cell Battery, and it has a backlit keyboard, which is great for students. (This is a student special, that is offered through Campus reps. PM me for this option) One downside is that the screen resolution on this option is not upgradable, and is stuck a 720p, which isnt the best for gaming.   If you are willing to buy a laptop before 6am tomorrow (5/20) then there is a huge special on the XPS 15 without a promocard.

t5_2qh61,Kanilas,1337487821,"&gt; I can't even fathom how you could put the difficulties of being an atheist on the same level as the ones most Muslims face.  [‚úî] Religion and law  It's the same fight, just different sides of it. In America, atheists are trying to keep the law secular, and free of religious influence. Muslims have to deal with the same sort of laws impinging on their religion, since the fervent backers of religious based laws are typically backing the Christian point-of-view, at least in the US.  [‚úî] Stereotypes  Muslims have to deal with being associated with terrorists, because of their religious practices, and their skin color. That, and the misconception about jihad, and taking over America. Atheists deal with the same kind of misguided hate from the right, with people complaining of a liberal secularist takeover of our schools. Both can be considered as 'hating America' and that they should 'get out of our country'.  [‚úî] Lack of acceptance  In 2006, according to a PEW Research Survey, 55% of Americans held a favorable opinion of Muslims. 35% were favorable of Atheists. Families have been torn asunder either for conversion to another religion, like Islam, or losing faith in the religion of the family. Compared to Christianity, both Islam and a lack of religion are sorely underrepresented in the US Congress, with the two sitting at a combined 1% of representation in the Congress, while nearly 18% of Americans are either Muslim, or not spiritual.   Yes, there are some big differences between the two. And while I don't pray to any atheist god, or attend atheist group meetings like religious people do, there're the exact same kind of discrimination from the majority in the US. Depending on where you are, it can be better or worse, but it's out there.",17647,1255,0,0,1,1,‚úî

t5_2qh61,WaylonCanDoThat,1337564466,"[‚úî] Religion and law    Well put. I would argue that atheists aren't the only people trying to keep the law secular, though. Many, I would guess the majority on personal experiences but could be wrong, religious people favor separation of church and state and would support the same types thing an atheist would. I think it's more of a ""the loud religious right vs. the rest of America"" than it is ""Christians vs. atheists"".    [‚úî] Stereotypes    Both have to deal with the same misguided hate for the right, yes. So does just about anybody who they feel doesn't agree with them. Post 9/11 Muslims had to deal with misguided hate from people from nearly every end of the religious/nonreligious spectrum, atheists included. Almost every black comedian had their own version of the ""thank you Muslims"" joke about how it was better to be black than Muslim. A lot of that initial hate has waned, but it is still there. It might be the same ""kind of hate"" but that doesn't make it equal.    [‚úî] Lack of acceptance    Good points. Don't really have anything to add.    It can also depend on whether or not an atheist views being an atheist as a defining characteristic. Somebody who when describing themselves would say ""I am an atheist"" as one of the first things would probably perceive having much more difficulty than somebody who wouldn't even think the mention being atheist which is why I liked ilivedinacake's ""Atheist vs. atheist"" distinction.

t5_2s7tt,Havoc_101,1337621466,"    In the beginning Man created God;     and in the image of Man     created he him.          2 And Man gave unto God a multitude of     names,that he might be Lord of all     the earth when it was suited to Man          3 And on the seven millionth     day Man rested and did lean     heavily on his God and saw that     it was good.          4 And Man formed Aqualung of     the dust of the ground, and a     host of others likened unto his kind.          5 And these lesser men were cast into the     void; And some were burned, and some were     put apart from their kind.          6 And Man became the God that he had     created and with his miracles did     rule over all the earth.          7 But as all these things     came to pass, the Spirit that did     cause man to create his God     lived on within all men: even     within Aqualung.          8 And man saw it not.          9 But for Christ's sake he'd     better start looking.   ¬© Ian Anderson 1971      ",8472,30,0,0,1,1,¬©

t5_2qhk3,C0CKPUNCHER,1337623151,"  #5 Ali provides examples that misidentify strengths as weaknesses Ali uses the example of how women place a smiley face next to a serious question as evidence that women are ‚Äúreducing the impact of having to express their true feelings.‚Äù How is it that expressing an issue or concern should not be done in a gentle way? If a woman or a man includes a smiley face next to a texted comment or concern, it indicates that they are not speaking from an entrenched reactive position but are instead receptive to dialogue.  Not only is this conducive to discussing the issue in a constructive way, it is the kind of skill set that can grow a more viable personal, business or social relationship. And it‚Äôs a skill set we should all be applying more often. It can be considered to be coming from a constructionist approach to communication. Ali‚Äôs use of this example as evidence of oppression is potentially chauvinistic in its way, because he privileges a style of communication that is blunt and unapologetic, a typically ‚Äúmale‚Äù style of communication.  #6 Ali‚Äôs article encourages counterproductive binary arguments The men in his article are two dimensional bullies that show no capacity for compassion or empathy. It makes for heightened drama and a great third act, but Ali is not writing entertainment. He is attempting to address real and painful social ills. And he is doing so in a way that is ultimately not helpful to men and women alike. We know that men are not two dimensional villains from the silver screen. Men are highly emotional creatures with vast capacities to love and be loved. Men can be spiritual healers and primary parents. They can be loving partners and caring teachers. And in all these roles, they encourage men and women alike to explore and share their emotions, to communicate their challenges and air their grievances.  ‚ô¶‚óä‚ô¶  Thank you, Yashar. I know your heart is in the right place I want to say clearly that yes, there are far too many female victims of silencing and abuse in the world. One person dealing with abuse is too many. But it is crucial to our ongoing dialogues to understand that the victims of abuse are men and women alike. It‚Äôs a fact that women have the potential to be just as emotionally and physically abusive as men. For some insight, look at the CDC‚Äôs statistics on physical abuse in relationships by gender. The report states: ‚ÄúMore than 1 in 3 women (35.6%) and more than 1 in 4 men (28.5%) in the United States have experienced rape, physical violence, and/or stalking by an intimate partner in their lifetime.‚Äù(1)  Yashar Ali has tapped into a major issue in our culture. He‚Äôs right that many women feel suppressed and devalued by people they work and live with. All of this is true. Ali has managed to create some powerful emotional resonance with his article. But it is important that we talk about what is happening between men and women in a holistic way. It is also important that we stay current in how we frame societal ills, so that we don‚Äôt devalue the progress that men and woman have created in partnership up to this point. So that we don‚Äôt drop back twenty years and pick up a more combative dialogue and bring it forward to now.  What can be immensely helpful instead, is to view these issues through the lens of what is called Appreciative Inquiry. Simply stated, we look for what is working and grow that, versus only pointing out the negative and attempting to eliminate it. Real progress has been made in terms of how men and women address emotions in their relationships. If we fail to acknowledge that, our actions do little to engage and grow successful trending change. Furthermore, appreciative inquiry teaches us to look for common ground and to be curious about ways we can support each other as we go forward in conversations like this one.  I fully understand there is work to be done. Holding someone else‚Äôs emotions can be frightening and destabilizing. Especially if we have no models for doing it in our lives or our families of origin. But we can learn how. We and our partners have to help each other learn how.  ‚ô¶‚óä‚ô¶  In my personal relationship, my wife and I are working to develop these kinds of emotion-holding skills. And top among them for me is the capacity to hear others‚Äô emotions and not immediately try and ‚Äúfix it‚Äù or in some way solve the problem. Instead, I‚Äôm learning to just listen and hear. For me, as a man, this is huge. The gift of the act of listening, decoupled from immediately REACTING can create a holding space for the emotions of others. Often, men like me will immediately focus on the source of the problem in an effort to eliminate the resulting uncomfortable emotions. There are times when focusing on fixing things is easier than experiencing our partner‚Äôs or our children‚Äôs pain or sadness. But the fact is, we human beings need to share our emotions. Fixing the problem can come later. When men (and women) learn to develop skills like this, it can go a long way to eliminating gaslighting. Because it creates the kind of emotional literacy that allows all of us to express ourselves more fully.  ‚ÄúStop feeling that way‚Äù becomes ‚Äúits okay that you feel that way‚Äù. And the oxygen of life and love reenters the room.",16727,2708,0,0,1,1,‚ô¶

t5_2qstm,bltst2,1337634026,"This took me like 5 mins to gather.  I'm an active investor but when it game to long term, retirement investing I was out of my league.  My company offered Financial Engines ([https://www.financialengines.com](https://www.financialengines.com)) as part of our 401K service and I've never been happier.  For a small service fee, they analyze, balance and make changes to my 401K automatically.  I'm seeing ROI of about 12% right now (3 years).  If you want to go at it alone, your choices need to reflect your anticipated retirement date, risk and goals.  You generally want a mixture of stocks (small and large), bonds, international and cash.  Here is what you own:  **Artisan Mid Cap Value Fund** -- long-term capital growth by investing in undervalued, medium-sized U.S. companies  **BlackRock International Index Fund** -- The investment seeks match the performance of the MSCI EAFE Index (Europe, Australasia, Far East) in U.S. dollars with net dividends as closely as possible before the deduction of fund expenses.  **FFI Treasury Fund** -- The fund‚Äôs objective is to seek current income consistent with liquidity and security of principal by investing in a portfolio of securities that are direct obligations of the US Treasury.  **Goldman Sachs Growth Opportunities** -- The investment seeks long-term growth of capital. The fund normally invests at least 90% of assets in equity securities with a primary focus on mid-cap companies. It primarily invests in publicly traded U.S. securities. The fund may also invest up to 25% of assets in foreign securities, including securities of issuers in emerging countries and securities quoted in foreign currencies.  **MFS¬Æ Emerging Markets Equity Fund**  -- The portfolio invests in stocks of emerging market companies around the world. This fund has the flexibility to invest across sectors, countries, and market capitalizations.  **Templeton Global Total Return Fund** -- Seeks total investment return consisting of a combination of interest income, capital appreciation, and currency gains. The fund's manager strategically allocates assets across fixed income markets around the world by tapping the expertise of the 100-plus investment professionals that compose the Franklin Templeton Fixed Income Group.  **Vanguard Short-Term Bond Index Fund Investor Shares** -- This index fund offers a low-cost, diversified approach to bond investing, providing broad exposure to U.S. investment-grade bonds with maturities from one to five years. Reflecting this goal, the fund invests about 30% of assets in corporate bonds and 70% in U.S. government bonds within that maturity range. A key risk of the fund is the fact that changes in interest rates can eventually lead to a decrease in income for the fund. Investors with a short-term savings goal who are willing to accept some price movement may wish to consider this fund.   **Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund Investor Shares** -- This fund is designed to provide broad exposure to U.S. investment grade bonds. Reflecting this goal, the fund invests about 30% in corporate bonds and 70% in U.S. government bonds of all maturities (short-, intermediate-, and long-term issues). As with other bond funds, one of the risks of the fund is that increases in interest rates may cause the price of the bonds in the portfolio to decrease‚Äîpricing the fund‚Äôs NAV lower. Because the fund invests in all segments and maturities of the fixed income market, investors may consider the fund their core bond holding.",2298,668,0,0,1,1,¬Æ

Depending on where you live, carrying as little as $200 in cash is for all intents and purposes, illegal.  edit: The following AP post illustrates the situation perfectly.  &gt;ACLU sues DEA on behalf of truck whose money was seized  &gt;¬© 2007 The Associated Press   &gt;ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. ‚Äî A trucker has sued the Drug Enforcement Administration, seeking to get back nearly $24,000 seized by DEA agents earlier this month at a weigh station on U.S. 54 in New Mexico north of El Paso, Texas.  &gt;Anastasio Prieto of El Paso gave a state police officer at the weigh station permission to search the truck to see if it contained ""needles or cash in excess of $10,000,"" according to the American Civil Liberties Union, which filed the federal lawsuit Thursday.  &gt;Prieto told the officer he didn't have any needles but did have $23,700.  &gt;Officers took the money and turned it over to the DEA. DEA agents photographed and fingerprinted Prieto over his objections, then released him without charging him with anything.  &gt;Border Patrol agents searched his truck with drug-sniffing dogs, but found no evidence of illegal substances, the ACLU said.  &gt;The lawsuit alleges the defendants violated Prieto's right to be free of unlawful search and seizure by taking his money without probable cause and by fingerprinting and photographing him.  &gt;""Mere possession of approximately $23,700 does not establish probable cause for a search or seizure,"" the lawsuit said.  &gt;It said Prieto pulled into the weigh station about 10:30 a.m. Aug. 8 and was let go about 4 p.m.  &gt;DEA agents told Prieto he would receive a notice of federal proceedings to permanently forfeit the money within 30 days and that to get it back, he'd have to prove it was his and did not come from illegal drug sales.  &gt;They told him the process probably would take a year, the ACLU said.  &gt;The ACLU's New Mexico executive director, Peter Simonson, said Prieto needs his money now to pay bills and maintain his truck. The lawsuit said Prieto does not like banks and customarily carries his savings as cash.  &gt;""The government took Mr. Prieto's money as surely as if he had been robbed on a street corner at night,"" Simonson said. ""In fact, being robbed might have been better. At least then the police would have treated him as the victim of a crime instead of as a perpetrator.""  &gt;The DEA did not immediately respond Friday to a request for comment from The Associated Press.  &gt;Peter Olson, a spokesman for the Department of Public Safety, which oversees state police, said he could not comment on pending litigation.  &gt;The lawsuit names DEA Administrator Karen P. Tandy, DEA task force officer Gary T. Apodaca, DEA agent Joseph Montoya and three state police officers identified only as John or Jane Doe.  There has been no further updates to this so the case is still in the courts. Our government will spend millions to make sure he never sees that money again.",37222,64,0,0,1,1,¬©
t5_2qpol,paulsagan4pres,1337694592,"In case anybody is confused, I wrote this   myself  Homosexuality is romantic or sexual attraction or behavior between members of the same sex or gender. As a sexual orientation, homosexuality refers to ""an enduring pattern of or disposition to experience sexual, affectionate, or romantic attractions"" primarily or exclusively to people of the same sex; ""it also refers to an individual's sense of personal and social identity based on those attractions, behaviors expressing them, and membership in a community of others who share them.""[1][2] Homosexuality is one of the three main categories of sexual orientation, along with bisexuality and heterosexuality, within the heterosexual-homosexual continuum (with asexuality sometimes considered the fourth). Scientific and medical understanding is that sexual orientation is not a choice, but rather a complex interplay of biological and environmental factors.[1][3] While some religious organizations hold the view that homosexual activity is unnatural or dysfunctional,[4] research shows that homosexuality is an example of normal variation in human sexuality and is not in and of itself a source of negative psychological effects.[1] Prejudice and discrimination against homosexual and bisexual people, however, have been shown to cause psychological harm.[5] The most common terms for homosexual people are lesbian for women and gay for men, though gay is also used to refer generally to homosexual men and women. The number of people who identify as gay or lesbian‚Äîand the proportion of people who have same-sex sexual experiences‚Äîare difficult for researchers to estimate reliably for a variety of reasons.[6] In the modern West, according to major studies, 1% to 3% of the population is homosexual, while 2% to 13% have had some form of same-sex sexual contact within their lifetime.[7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17] In a 2006 study, 20% of respondents anonymously reported some homosexual feelings, although 2-3% identified themselves as homosexual.[18] Homosexual behavior is also widely observed in animals.[19][20][21][22][23] Many gay and lesbian people are in committed same-sex relationships, though only recently have census forms and political conditions facilitated their visibility and enumeration.[24][25][26][27][28][29][30][31][32] These relationships are equivalent to heterosexual relationships in essential psychological respects.[2] Homosexual relationships and acts have been admired, as well as condemned, throughout recorded history, depending on the form they took and the culture in which they occurred.[33] Since the end of the 19th century, there has been a movement towards increased visibility, recognition and legal rights for homosexual people, including the rights to marriage and civil unions, adoption and parenting, employment, military service, and equal access to health care.

In the context of sexuality, lesbian refers only to female homosexuality. The word ""lesbian"" is derived from the name of the Greek island Lesbos, where the poet Sappho wrote largely about her emotional relationships with young women.[35][36] Many modern style guides in the U.S. recommend against using homosexual as a noun, instead using gay man or lesbian.[37] Similarly, some recommend completely avoiding usage of homosexual as it has a negative, clinical history and because the word only refers to one's sexual behavior (as opposed to romantic feelings) and thus it has a negative connotation.[37] Gay and lesbian are the most common alternatives. The first letters are frequently combined to create the initialism LGBT (sometimes written as GLBT), in which B and T refer to bisexual and transgender people. The first known appearance of homosexual in print is found in an 1869 German pamphlet by the Austrian-born novelist Karl-Maria Kertbeny, published anonymously,[38] arguing against a Prussian anti-sodomy law.[39][40] In 1879, Gustav Jager used Kertbeny's terms in his book, Discovery of the Soul (1880).[40] In 1886, Richard von Krafft-Ebing used the terms homosexual and heterosexual in his book Psychopathia Sexualis, probably borrowing them from Jager. Krafft-Ebing's book was so popular among both layman and doctors that the terms ""heterosexual"" and ""homosexual"" became the most widely accepted terms for sexual orientation.[40][41] As such, the current use of the term has its roots in the broader 19th-century tradition of personality taxonomy.  Although early writers also used the adjective homosexual to refer to any single-sex context (such as an all-girls' school), today the term is used exclusively in reference to sexual attraction, activity, and orientation. The term homosocial is now used to describe single-sex contexts that are not specifically sexual. There is also a word referring to same-sex love, homophilia. Some synonyms for same-sex attraction or sexual activity include men who have sex with men or MSM (used in the medical community when specifically discussing sexual activity) and homoerotic (referring to works of art). Pejorative terms in English include queer, faggot, fairy, poof, and homo. Beginning in the 1990s, some of these have been reclaimed as positive words by gay men and lesbians, as in the usage of queer studies, queer theory, and even the popular American television program Queer Eye for the Straight Guy. The word homo occurs in many other languages without the pejorative connotations it has in English. As with ethnic slurs and racial slurs, however, the misuse of these terms can still be highly offensive; the range of acceptable use depends on the context and speaker. Conversely, gay, a word originally embraced by homosexual men and women as a positive, affirmative term (as in gay liberation and gay rights), has come into widespread pejorative use among young people. History  Main articles: LGBT history and Timeline of LGBT history Societal attitudes towards same-sex relationships have varied over time and place, from expecting all males to engage in same-sex relationships, to casual integration, through acceptance, to seeing the practice as a minor sin, repressing it through law enforcement and judicial mechanisms, and to proscribing it under penalty of death. In a detailed compilation of historical and ethnographic materials of Preindustrial Cultures, ""strong disapproval of homosexuality was reported for 41% of 42 cultures; it was accepted or ignored by 21%, and 12% reported no such concept. Of 70 ethnographies, 59% reported homosexuality absent or rare in frequency and 41% reported it present or not uncommon.""[42] In cultures influenced by Abrahamic religions, the law and the church established sodomy as a transgression against divine law or a crime against nature. The condemnation of anal sex between males, however, predates Christian belief. It was frequent in ancient Greece; ""unnatural"" can be traced back to Plato.[43] Many historical figures, including Socrates, Lord Byron, Edward II, and Hadrian,[44] have had terms such as gay or bisexual applied to them; some scholars, such as Michel Foucault, have regarded this as risking the anachronistic introduction of a contemporary construction of sexuality foreign to their times,[45] though others challenge this.[46] A common thread of constructionist argument is that no one in antiquity or the Middle Ages experienced homosexuality as an exclusive, permanent, or defining mode of sexuality. John Boswell has countered this argument by citing ancient Greek writings by Plato,[47] which describe individuals exhibiting exclusive homosexuality.   Khnumhotep and Niankhkhnum.

Some gear, like the super-popular 6500 series have vertical fan trays on one side of the equipment.  If you wire them split down the middle and then find you have to replace said fan tray it requires unplugging 50% of the connections!  On a box like this the device must be cabled out one side, the side opposite the fan tray.  Generally I like to cable modular switches to one side.  Why?  You can pop out a line card with all the cables attached for testing / replacement.  With a split design you have to undo all the cables to remove the card and leave them hanging while you put in a replacement.  For fixed 1RU switches (including stackables) I generally prefer the 50/50 split to each side.  The entire point is, make future maintenance on the equipment as easy as possible!

t5_2qore,morewood,1337868978,"&gt;We‚Äôd like to address some of the ongoing concerns from the Diablo¬Æ III community since the game went live last week, and go into more detail about how we plan to tackle some of the lingering post-launch issues so players can focus on what they want to be focused on -- playing Diablo III. &gt; &gt;**Hotfixes, Upcoming Patch, and Ongoing Issues** &gt; &gt;Since the game‚Äôs launch, we‚Äôve applied a number of hotfixes to address gameplay issues, made tweaks to improve our service stability, and performed occasional server maintenance when necessary to ensure that in the long term, players have the best gameplay experience possible. Moving forward, additional server maintenances will be required -- and sometime next week, we plan to release a game update in the form of a patch that will further address client issues and apply additional bug fixes. &gt; &gt;We also wanted to let you know that we‚Äôre still looking into the best way to address the achievements that some players lost in the hours following the game‚Äôs release. While we don‚Äôt have any concrete details to share with you just yet, we will have more information to share in the weeks ahead. We appreciate everyone‚Äôs patience as we work to improve stability and usability for all players. &gt; &gt;**Real-Money Auction House Coming Soon** &gt; &gt;In light of the post-launch obstacles we‚Äôve encountered, we have made the decision to move the launch of the real-money auction house beyond the previously estimated May time frame. As we mentioned in our original announcement, our goal has always been to ensure everyone has the smoothest experience possible when the real-money auction house launches, and we need a bit more time to iron out the existing general stability and gameplay issues before that feature goes live. While we don‚Äôt have a new launch date to share just yet, we‚Äôll have more information soon. &gt; &gt;**Battle.net¬Æ/Diablo III Security Concerns** &gt; &gt;Over the past couple of days, players have expressed concerns over the possibility of Battle.net¬Æ account compromises. First and foremost, we want to make it clear that the Battle.net and Diablo III servers have not been compromised. In addition, the number of Diablo III players who‚Äôve contacted customer service to report a potential compromise of their personal account has been extremely small. In all of the individual Diablo III-related compromise cases we‚Äôve investigated, none have occurred after a physical Battle.net Authenticator or Battle.net Mobile Authenticator app was attached to the player‚Äôs account, and we have yet to find any situation where a Diablo III player's account was accessed outside of ‚Äútraditional‚Äù compromise methods (i.e. someone logging using an account's login email and password). &gt; &gt;To that end, we‚Äôve also seen discussions regarding the possibility of account compromises occurring in ways that didn‚Äôt involve these ‚Äútraditional‚Äù methods -- for example, by ‚Äúsession spoofing‚Äù a player‚Äôs identity after he or she joins a public game. Regarding this specific example, we‚Äôve looked into the issue and found no evidence to indicate compromises are occurring in this fashion, and we‚Äôve determined the methods being suggested to do so are technically impossible. However, you have our assurance that we‚Äôll continue to investigate reports such as these and keep you informed of important updates. &gt; &gt;The best defense against account theft still includes smart password management (e.g. using a unique password for every site/service and keeping your password to yourself) and scanning for malware and viruses regularly, as well as following additional preventative steps found here. In the end, while no security method is 100% foolproof, the physical Battle.net Authenticator and Battle.net Mobile Authenticator app are great ways to provide your account with an extra layer of protection. &gt; &gt;We hope this update has addressed some of the concerns you‚Äôve had. In the end, we simply want all of our players to be able to fully enjoy Diablo III, and we‚Äôve been working around the clock to address issues as quickly and efficiently as possible. We appreciate your continued support and enthusiasm, and we hope you and your friends are having a blast slaying Sanctuary‚Äôs demons. &gt;  EDIT: Format",1324,532,0,0,1,1,¬Æ

In all of the individual Diablo III-related compromise cases we've investigated, none have occurred after a physical Battle.net Authenticator or Battle.net Mobile Authenticator app was attached to the player's account, and we have yet to find any situation where a Diablo III player's account was accessed outside of ""traditional"" compromise methods (i.e. someone logging using an account's login email and password).  To that end, we've also seen discussions regarding the possibility of account compromises occurring in ways that didn‚Äôt involve these ""traditional"" methods -- for example, by ""session spoofing"" a player‚Äôs identity after he or she joins a public game. Regarding this specific example, we've looked into the issue and found no evidence to indicate compromises are occurring in this fashion, and we've determined the methods being suggested to do so are technically impossible. However, you have our assurance that we‚Äôll continue to investigate reports such as these and keep you informed of important updates.  The best defense against account theft still includes smart password management (e.g. using a unique password for every site/service and keeping your password to yourself) and scanning for malware and viruses regularly, as well as following additional preventative steps found here. In the end, while no security method is 100% foolproof, the physical Battle.net Authenticator and Battle.net Mobile Authenticator app are great ways to provide your account with an extra layer of protection.""",1334,7,0,0,1,1,¬Æ

Epidemiology data from road traffic arrests and fatalities indicate that after alcohol, marijuana is the most frequently detected psychoactive substance among driving populations. Marijuana has been shown to impair performance on driving simulator tasks and on open and closed driving courses for up to approximately 3 hours. Decreased car handling performance, increased reaction times, impaired time and distance estimation, inability to maintain headway, lateral travel, subjective sleepiness, motor incoordination, and impaired sustained vigilance have all been reported. Some drivers may actually be able to improve performance for brief periods by overcompensating for self-perceived impairment. The greater the demands placed on the driver, however, the more critical the likely impairment. Marijuana may particularly impair monotonous and prolonged driving. Decision times to evaluate situations and determine appropriate responses increase. Mixing alcohol and marijuana may dramatically produce effects greater than either drug on its own.",14453,225,0,0,1,1,¬Æ

I changed ""annoyed"" to ""annoying"" which I guess was your intended word)  Correct‚ù£  &gt; This setup relies on two things: the GPL is flawless, you are flawless.  Yes, this is the basis for my way of thinking and actioning, however, despite I have a [big ego and some narcissistic symptoms](http://wish-it.se/hip/singularity2) I do not suffer from hybris[1], and I know that GPL is not flawless and I am not flawless.  Regarding GPL, I'm aware that the forcing nature of GPL can be annoying for some[2]. However, as I have expressed in other places, for now, I see GPL as THE way to lead us out from a world controlled by proprietary (read monetary/profit[3]) thinking actors. In the way I see it (as I discussed on my blog entry from Dec [""Love as a universal concept""](http://rolandorre.se/?p=15) ) I view GPL  as ""mutual love"" or ""love by contract"" that is, like a marriage. BSD on the other hand, I refer to as ""agape"" or unconditional love. Ideally, I would see a world without any proprietary software, and then the issue about GPL versus BSD would be completely irrelevant.  Regarding myself, I have flaws, I'm a human being, I may wish that I had less flaws, but when I discuss or get annoyed I do not look upon myself as that flawless right-knowing guy,  I get annoyed of things that are wrong, but I do not claim that my view is absolute or even right. I do claim though that my brain is ""auto-logic"" which is somewhat controversial (especially as I've defined Love as logic).  ---------------  1. I score 100% in personality tests about self-insight (other irrelevant info: 85% in optimism, 84% in romance, [99% in nerd score](http://www.nada.kth.se/~orre/) and in a happiness-test I scored 4.48 of 6 =&gt; very happy)     2. most likely those [monochr](http://www.reddit.com/user/monochr) in [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/u0teo/free_software_idealism_is_a_necessary_and/c4rde7j) refer to as *weasels*.     3.

After I got into the show, I found this place and thought it was hilarious and wonderful. * I never felt like I had to or anything, it just makes me smile to see all the novel ideas people have about the show and how they manifest in the creative work‚Äîa very large portion of which is top-notch quality! * Well, if someone (i.e. an adult) feels strongly connected to a particular character or even the show in general, they will probably tend to think about that character or world in the many various contexts of their own life.  However, more adult themes like sexuality and other mature things are entirely omitted from the show, so it seems reasonable for people to want to fill the gaps in their psyche left by the show's limitations. * I'm not attracted to any of the characters (they're fictional!) although some of their personalities remind me of things that attract or even repel me in humans, and it's fun to identify with the characters as their interactions reveal those traits. * (This one doesn't really apply here...) * I think it's probably because lots of people here find the human form sexy, which makes sense, given that we're humans :)  Oh, it's fine if you think this place is weird.

t5_2qi79,killthezombie,1338133843,"***What is the Year / Make / Model?***  August 1966 Fender Mustang.  ***Where did you buy it, and what can others expect to pay for the same item?***  I got this from an ad on Gumtree. After months of trawling online and trying to get ones with specific parts, I found that this one was the best priced and, after chatting to the seller, was able to collect it and make a new friend in the process.   Expect to find lots online with heavy mods, and to be honest, these mods aren't always a bad thing, it seriously devalues it, but can (a lot of the time) make it a better guitar. This one has had newer pickups installed, but all other hardware is original.  ***What is the link to the manufacturer's product page or a page with more information?***  After deciding against the many reissues out there (particularly japanese) I decided to hunt out an original, mainly because although I love japanese fender, there were quite a few mustang reissues that just disappointed me in quality control standards. Watch out for badly finished frets and nasty neck lacquer. You can find a lot of mustang reissues here on [fender's main site](http://www.fender.com/en-GB/products/search.php?section=guitars&amp;bodyShape=Mustang¬Æ)  ***What is the construction like (type of wood, wiring, case, tubes, etc..)?***  Wood type is alder, fitting with most fender's in the CBS era. Information on that can be found [here](http://home.provide.net/~cfh/fender2.html#mustang)  ***What made you want to buy it?***  I'm a short guy, so the first reason I swayed towards Mustang's was the shorter scale length. I love Jaguars, and everything [offset](reddit.com/r/offset) but found most too big and clunky for my on-stage antics. I'm a big fan of Billy Corgan and found the pickups here to be just a little less hot than his, letting me really get that alternative fuzz squeal!   ***What do you love about it now that you have it?***  The neck is amazing. I mean, just superb. Its part;y down to the amount it's been played, but also partly down to the lacquer they used before 1968. I've played later models and the lacquer is just a bit thicker and a bit stickier, this one seems just the right texture, and whats more, the profile is perfect for me. The weight is amazing, and the balance is great. The access to the top frets is just right, a little better than my strat, and a little bit more fun to play due to the scale length.  ***If anything, What might be upgraded/fixed/altered?***  I might replace the on-off switches on each pickup as they are a little bit loose, and don't click as firmly into position as they should for on stage playability. They were in much worse shape when I got them, but after servisol and a bit of cleaning, they are much better now.  I really might consider having a professional re-finish done on it, in nitro-cellulose. It was originally daphne blue, but I might have it refinished in olympic white. Its much further down the line though and I might change my mind before then.  ***How versatile is it (ability to be used in various genres/styles)?***  Very. Surprisingly the pickup switching gives you loads of combinations of in phase, out of phase and both on and off. I've yet to crank it up at a band rehearsal but at home, I'm finding it as versatile as a stratocaster, even though its without a middle pickup.  ***What else can you tell us about it?***  The case (pictured) isn't original, and was hand-made by someone many years ago. The interior of it was just raw sponge, and so my girlfriend and I decided to re-line it with leopard print, and cut out foam especially for the shape of the guitar, keeping the new baby safe :)  edit: punctuation",1528,828,0,0,1,1,¬Æ

Zegerid¬Æ contains 1100mg of Sodium bicarbonate per pill. The molecular weight of Sodium bicarbonate is about 84 and Sodium is about 23, so roughly 27% of Sodium bicarbonate is Sodium. That means a 1100mg pill has about 300mg of Sodium in it. However, since Zegerid¬Æ is only once a day, I think it is negligible.  You're right about Alka-Seltzer¬Æ, it has a bit more Sodium &amp; it can be used more frequently (up to 8 a day for young folks &amp; 4 a day for 60 or older), so I think you have a good point here.

Are you that out of touch? He did it calmly, didn't announce it, didn't do anything crazy. It's not ""showy"". It's not a tantrum. The only reason ANYONE actually even knows about it is because he was missing for a few moments and it prompted people to search for him and likely check his social media sites for a hint as to where he was. 'Had that not happened, you'd likely not even know about it because he likely didn't want to make a big deal about it.

( As he, himself, did not bring forward information of his actions---Which is the ""tell"" for what a tantrum is. Even from a psychological standpoint of narcissism, he would WANT people to know and would state it somehow. He did not. He was missing for all of five minutes, returned, forfeited a match, and retired to his room not stating to a single person that he had deleted his social media groupings. )  He didn't throw a tantrum.  I'm sorry, but you've lost this ""gentleman's"" argument. Take your drama hunting elsewhere please. 8) ( Which you are clearly doing now, since you are desperately trying to convince me that this is more than it really is. )  TL;DR: I still love you so please read it instead of being rude. ‚ô•",29223,397,0,0,0,1,‚ô•

Buy some used textbooks, check the conditions, mend some parts back together if you need to and sell it back online \ in school bookstores.

t5_2qh5b,Zombiescout,1338318974,"&gt;But I also assume, that since this is a possible state of existence for the mind, than it is by extension possible for a mind to function adequately in this state, given an acceptable period of acclimatization.  I see little basis for the claim that the mind can acclimate to anything, psychic breaks etc. brought on by extreme stress would at least *prima facie* speak against that. It also seems to be that if you take eventually towards infinite time that it is not testable or useful.   &gt;I am attempting to distinguish between the label conferred on the word, the abstract symbol that represents the idea, and the 'meaning' or 'explanation' which is inextricably derived from an action.  The meaning is not derived from an action though, it has to be acquired through one but on a broadly Fregean account the meaning is passive and more or less the extension of the term.   &gt; Perhaps you don't agree with me, but I am struck that the 1-ness has vastly more importance than the mere symbol itself, the numeral 1.  Sure but that is, to me at least, the extension of ""1"". Extensions just kind of are there and are what we refer to (this is a very rough sketch and there are lots of problems with this theory)   &gt;But even so, are you really willing to assume that there needn't be consciousness for observation to occur?   Yes. Machines can observe in this sense, which means other objects can too. That is why I thought you were on about quantum consciousness and Capra. The observer just measures or makes note of, or feels, or what have you, the resolution of entanglement or decision depending on your preferred theory. Not only that if you follow Everett then observation does not cause wave function collapse and so there it loses much of its specialness.   &gt;As to the affect of intention on observations, this requires further definition. Are you saying your observations are not affected by the intentions you have? Or are you saying all observations are not affected by anyone's intentions? Or somewhere in between?  Quantum observations are not affected by intentions. My observations (non-quantum) are affected by my intentions.   &gt;I don't think you can say this. The Oxford English Dictionary defines intentionality as ""the distinguishing property of mental phenomena of being necessarily directed upon an object, whether real or imaginary."" Unless you can describe to me a situation where the observer arrives at his observation without using intentionality. Perhaps I'm unaware, and this mode of unintentional observation is integral to the study of quantum mechanics. I think this harkens back to your qualm with 'quantum consciousness'.  Blindsight would be the first thing I think of. Obviously the person still has intentions but he is observing something without being able to say anything about it and having no conscious content of it. But again the main issue is equivocation of observation in QM with observation in everyday parlance.    &gt;Ah, but here you haven't actually explained anything. You begin your observation with ""...there is some..."" This is both the explanation and the cause. It is very small and doesn't explain a great deal, if anything. But saying ""There is some milk that (has such and such properties)"" and saying ""There is some milk because I spilled it,"" doesn't preclude an example of causation. You simply extend your explanation of cause in the second sentence, and expand on details of the state of the milk in the first.  They are two distinct explanations though. One reductive non-causal, one reductive causal. Both explain the same thing but one is less useful when answering the question of why the milk is there.   &gt;The observed phenomena are identical, not in that the particular conditions of their observation are identical, which I tried to make clear, but that their source, from which they emerge and which is radically irreductible (as a premise), is unchanging.  They wouldn't be identical then, just from the same source. Even if they had the same character they would still not be identical. Formally x=y ‚Üí ‚àÄF(Fx ‚Üî Fy) is usually taken to be the basis for identity. If you give up identity for congruence then it works but I am not sure if it really says anything then.   &gt;If this is the what you mean by the problem of overdetermination, I think the problem in my exposition is that I didn't distinguish between the subjective nature of an explanation (i.e. its characteristics, form) and the applicable use of said explanation (i.e. the function).   There is no such distinction though. Either an explanation explains its explanadum or it does not. How you then use them is irrelevant.  I don't get the point about facsimlies, why would sameness of form make copies erroneous?   Explanation here is not the act of explaining something as we often use it in everyday life. It is [explanandum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explanandum) plus explanans. That is to say that we are dealing with propositions only.  ",5725,14,0,0,1,1,‚Üî

From the MAGIC: THE GATHERING¬Æ TOURNAMENT RULES, section 2.1:  ""A Magic match consists of a series of games that are played until one side has won an announced number. Drawn games do not count toward this goal, and the match continues for as many games as necessary or until time ends for the round, in which case the winner of the match is the player who has won the most games at that point. If both players have equal game wins, the match is a draw. The default number of games required for winning a match is two.  From the same rules (section 2.4):  ""If a game or match is not completed, players may concede or mutually agree to a draw in that game or match.""  I don't like that idea, but it is within the scope of the rules to intentionally draw a game (not the match) then go back to sideboarding/shuffling.  EDIT:  I used to run tournaments, and dealt with 2-1-1 or similar results occasionally.  In case 1, you would potentially report the winner as 2-2, and the loser as 1-3.",2569,663,0,0,1,1,¬Æ
t5_2qh5b,jochi_golden_horde,1338324775,"&gt; I see little basis for the claim that the mind can acclimate to anything, psychic breaks etc. brought on by extreme stress would at least prima facie speak against that. It also seems to be that if you take eventually towards infinite time that it is not testable or useful.  Ok, but here I'm not arguing for an infinite timeline. I'm supposing that with appropriate diligence a mind could achieve our desired 'threshold' within a tractable length of time, even a human life time.  &gt; The meaning is not derived from an action though, it has to be acquired through one but on a broadly Fregean account the meaning is passive and more or less the extension of the term.  &gt; Sure but that is, to me at least, the extension of ""1"". Extensions just kind of are there and are what we refer to (this is a very rough sketch and there are lots of problems with this theory)  I don't want to get into a chicken and the egg thing here. To take the above stance, would you assert that all meaning is intrinsic arising from its relative word form, and we must extract the latent meaning from said form?  &gt; Yes. Machines can observe in this sense (unconsciously), which means other objects can too. The observer just measures or makes note of, or feels, or what have you, the resolution of entanglement or decision depending on your preferred theory.  This is an interesting point. However, while a machine can conduct an experiment and record the results, can it then take that data and use it to design another experiment to make further conclusions? If it cannot, then I would argue that it has not observed, or at least understood, anything. The machine has no more bared witness than a tree bares witness to the passing seasons. (You can take this discussion into plant sentience if you wish).  &gt; Not only that if you follow Everett then observation does not cause wave function collapse and so there it loses much of its specialness. Quantum observations are not affected by intentions. My observations (non-quantum) are affected by my intentions.  Everett fell off after his initial break through with the many worlds interpretation. He had scant faith in its validity to begin with, and would not have published it if it weren't for the inadvertent support by his mentor, Archibald Wheeler. But where I have to disagree with you is when you state ""My observations (non-quantum)"". There is no such thing. You must concede that quantum affects are observable by methods that are simple, repeatable, and easily recreated. In this way, they are no more inextricable from your observations than the force of gravity. To say that your observations are non-quantum is akin to saying, ""My observations have such and such quality within the laws of Newtonian classical physics."" Yes, that may be true in the abstract. But I am not talking about abstract reality. A premise of my initial argument is that it is set in reality without clause or addendum. As it is, if you were.  &gt; They wouldn't be identical then, just from the same source. Even if they had the same character they would still not be identical. Formally x=y ‚Üí ‚àÄF(Fx ‚Üî Fy) is usually taken to be the basis for identity. If you give up identity for congruence then it works but I am not sure if it really says anything then.  You are not seeing the distinction between subject and action. Identity is a label, a characteristic, a subject. These phenomena don't require an identical character. I'd refer you to another sentence in that paragraph. ""The phenomenal experience is not identical, but there is a characteristic inherent to the phenomena that is experienced by both or many parties, which leads to a similar conclusion."" So here you've moved back from the experiences of the phenomena being identical, which I conceded they are not, to the phenomena themselves being identical, which, I'm not sure if you can distinguish the experience of phenomena from phenomena itself.  In either case, the subject, or form of the phenomena isn't as important as its functioning role in the conclusion of an experiment, the deduction from an observation. When I mentioned the fascimilies (I may have used this word in the wrong way), I was speaking of identical copies. If you conduct an experiment, and observe *subjectively identical* phenomena (which you have said is impossible due to overdetermination), your conclusion won't differ from the initial conclusion, unless you made a human error. This could happen many, many times, and it wouldn't affect your understanding one iota. If you conduct an experiment, and observe *functionally identical* phenomena, again, they would lead to a definite and predetermined conclusion, rendering the entire experiment useless. This is only evident upon repeated testing, which is why science is conducted with such rigor and all theories are shrouded in such skepticism. Eventually though, we could rule out these copies for they do not further our understanding.  What we are trying to understand, our intention if you will, by observing phenomena, is this: **How does (blank) occur?** Apparently you call this question an explanandum. This requires an explanans: **Because there is (blank)**. But if you ask me, ""Why does it rain?"" And I answer, ""Because there are clouds."" What have you learned? What depth and breadth does my explanans have? Very little. You know that there is some kind of causal relationship between rain and clouds, perhaps in future you should expect to see rain when you see clouds. But you know nothing of the changing states of matter, of evaporation and condensation, of meteorological patterns or the rain shadow effect. My explanans to you is a superficial explanans. Furthermore, you are much less likely to accept my explanans (unless you have great faith in me), especially if you already hold an explanans that appears superior in its form and its function.  Now, if we are concerned with understanding reality, do you think we should distinguish between explanations that are superficial in form and function, or those that have a dramatic breadth and depth? Here I would equate form to an explanation's ability to be assimilated by others (a craft we are exercising at present) and its function would be the amount of content conferred on the audience (or understanding). Here I think that form and function of explanations, which compose the **active conduit for exchange of understanding**, are not in any way irrelevant. I would consider them tantamount.",119,3,0,0,1,1,‚Üî

t5_2qh1i,no-mad,1338380790,"  Although the Death Star plans need to get to Yavin as soon as possible, Obi-Wan needs to make one more diversion first. If the Empire knows that Leia is a Rebel leader, then they also know about her father and the whole Organa family may need immediate evacuation. Fortunately, before coming to Tattoine, R2 had already arranged transport, which is waiting at Mos Eisley, under the command of the Rebellion's other chief field agent and espionage asset. Chewbacca. 20 years earlier, Chewbacca was second in command of the defence of his planet. He's there in the tactical conferences and there on the front lines and is a personal friend of Yoda's. When he needed reliable people to join the embryonic Alliance, who else would Yoda turn to but his old friend from Kashykk? Given his background, there is no way that Chewie would spend the crucial years of the rebellion as the second-in-command to (sorry Han) a low-level smuggler. Unless it's his cover. In fact, Chewie is a top-line spy and flies what is in many ways the Rebellion's best ship.  The Millenium Falcon may look like a beat-up old freighter but it can outrun any Imperial ship in normal space or hyperspace, hang in a firefight with a Star Destroyer or outmaneouvre a dozen top-of-the-line TIE fighters. It's a remarkable feat of engineering and must have cost a colossal fortune to build. How does Han come to own a ship like that? He only thinks he does, actually it's Chewie's. Half-way through RotS, we see the Falcon landing at the Senate building on Coruscant. If it's the same ship (which of course it is) then it was the personal transport of one of the senatorial delegations - a much more likely source to commission its design. That delegatino must have later joined the Rebellion and given it the use of the Falcon. In fact, if the delegation is the one from Kashykk, then the ship may have belonged to Chewbacca as early as RotS.  Han is Chewie's front man. It's much better, and safer for him, if he doesn't know what's really going on. Chewie used to work with Lando Calrissian in a similar way but Lando wanted to settle down, so Chewie arranged for him to lose the Falcon in a card game to Han Solo, an even better choice as partner. Han and Chewie's working method is pretty much what we see in the cantina scene: Chewie make the contacts and sets up the deals, then turns them over to Han who haggles over the price and gives the final yea or nay. This lets Chewie wander the seamy underside of the galaxy pretty much at will, making contacts, gathering and passing information with no-one was the wiser, especially not Han.  Chewie persuaded Han to do business with Jabba the Hutt so he could make regular runs to Tattoine, where Chewie could pass messages between Kenobi and Organa. When R2's urgent message came through only days before, the only way for Chewie to get back to Tattoine in time was to make the ""mistake"" that forced Han to dump his cargo to avoid capture. As a down side, this led to Solo's getting a death mark out on him from Jabba the Hutt. Chewie was a bit upset about the need for that but figured they weren't going to be dealing with Tattoine for much longer.  En route to Alderaan, R2 and Chewie play stop-motion chess. This is the latest in a series of games they've played over the year in the back rooms of space stations and cantinas across the galaxy, but this is the first time they've done it in front of their respective straight men, so they put on a big show.  Then it all goes wrong again. Alderaan is gone and the Falcon is caught and brought aboard the Death Star. Only Han, Luke and 3PO don't know just how much trouble they're in but Obi-Wan has a plan and seems confident (but Jedi always do). Soon afterwards, R2 finds Leia in the detention cells and shouts that they have to rescue her, to which Chewie can only agree. If Vader learns he has a daughter, then they're all in deep trouble, so Chewie does his bit to persuade Han to go along with Luke's plan.  Then, on the verge of escape, Vader himself turns up only yards from both of his children, one of whom is leaking Force all over the place. Obi-Wan stages a distraction by letting himself die and go into the Force while the others escape. At this point, Chewie suddenly realises that he's been left in charge, not only of the Death Star Plans and the survival of the Rebellion but of the secret son and daughter of Darth Vader. With the Organas and Kenobi all dead, only Chewie, R2 and Yoda know who Luke and Leia are. And only Ob-Wan knew where Yoda has been hiding. Chewie is stressed out by the responsibility and R2 (who keeps making crude jokes about the whole affair) is being no help at all.  Chewie's first problem is what is happening between Luke and Leia. With a psychic link they can feel but don't understand, thrown together in a life-or-death escape, they are looking at each other with a sparky intensity that Chewie gradually recognises as Romantic Tension. He's no expert on human relationships but Chewie is fairly sure that that's Wrong, so he does the only thing he can under the circumstances - he throws Han at her. Han is at first not interested but after a while starts to warm to the idea with an intensity that gives Chewie new worries.  When they reach Yavin, Han decides to take the money and run and Chewie decides to go with him. Looked at in cold light, it's for the good of the Rebellion. Even if Yavin is destroyed, there'll be one agent who knows what's going on who can try and put something back together, but he doesn't feel good about it. When Han decides to turn around and join the attack, Chewie is all for it.  Han and Luke get medals but Chewie doesn't. Actually, Leia offers him one but Chewie turns it down. He got one of those things from Yoda about 20 years ago, but there's no way he can tell her that.  As the film ends, the three founders of the Rebellion are all gone. Bail Organa is dead, Yoda is out of contact and Obi-Wan's ghost can only talk to other Jedi. (So that would be Yoda then.) Thus, the field leadership of the rebellion has just been turned over to the daughter of Darth Vader. Chewie is really hoping that someone with an official rank greater than hers will get here real soon before he has to think really seriously about option C.  ¬© Keith Martin 2005    No cliff notes ... well, my basic cliff note is this: R2D2 and Chewbacca are the REAL heroes of the story.

t5_2qhmh,aim2free,1338382086,"Beautiful pic‚ù£  Regarding creativity, from my model there are (at least) two types of creativity. One is the artist's (which would be the right half) and one is the logical problem solver (which would be the left half), and a third when combining these two.[1]  For my own I'm considered creative, but my creativity is not the artist's my creativy is within logical problem solving.  This left-right generalization is considered controversial though, it's not so much related to scientific opinions.  ----    1. an example upon a combinatoric creativity. Think about a musical theme, inventing a new musical theme, never heard of before, that would be a typical right brain creativity, then by applying rules for different types of transformations and relations, like e.g for a fugue or a schlager, then you can twist and turn this new theme into a shape, like a melody or a symphony. (fyi: I am not able to compose music, and am completely unable to invent a never heard musical theme, but if I had that theme, I am able to understand how rules can be applied to make a composition, as a generic design problem)",8045,129,0,0,1,1,‚ù£

t5_2qh6c,aim2free,1338403767,"Very interesting that you asked about Noahide, as 7 is an extremely strong number for me, and I consider the 10 commandments to be more rules than needed. (I consider the Love commandment sufficient).  What I experienced was more like playing a role in the 2nd coming (i.e. your Messiah). I had an extremely tough week (coincidental in time with Passover) from an existential point of view, my body was twitching in the beginning of the week and at the end of the week, where it (here in Sweden) was two Annunciation Days in a row, both Saturday and Sunday, which is very very rare. I also felt a deep identity with God, and when I was speaking with people it was like they were very far away. I also, through introspection like a religious experience, made my first approach to a Love based artificial intelligence algorithm, which I wrote about here in Dec [""Love as a universal concept""](http://rolandorre.se/?p=15) (as well as in my thesis in 2003). (The actual shape of the algorithm is presented here [Love driven revolutionary AI](http://rolandorre.se/?p=47).  The reasons why I considered converting to your religion were mostly that the manifestation of my experiences I associated with Israel. The crescendo was strong twitches in my legs, an incredible strong ""lifting force"" of my brain, and a very strong religious experience, which I had never had before like that, apart from a (completely different one) visual[1] with cold sweat and convulsions during 3 min in 1987, when I saw a picture I didn't recognize until a couple of years ago).  My experiences started 23:00 Swedish time, which is 24:00 Israelian time, and lasted until 00:00 Swedish time, ie. 01:00 Israelian time. (My girlfriend was very worried, she didn't understand what was happening, no worries I said). This event was when the Swedish calender changed from ""Announciation day""  (Marie beb√•delsedag) to ""Announciation Lady Day"" (Jungfru Marie beb√•delsedag) (here a [Swedish calender](http://www.dinstartsida.se/almanacka.asp?datum=2000-03-01) over March 2000. Now I noticed that the Sunday also was ""Emanuel"" day which was the name of my father. For my own also have the names Adam Immanuel, which I'm now using as initials as it fits very well with the project I'm working on which is based upon AI (artificial Intelligence).  The project I'm working on I started the same month in March 2000, and it has since then maturated with methods, trademarks etc, even patents (although I'm a patent abolishonist) and the methods I developed during my PhD and later as consultant for WHO will be used within this project with goal to start the technological evolution with a highly ethical agenda, with goal to make every human being on the planet ultra hip and creative, that is, every being should be able to follow their own will without being told by someone else how to be. This is one [brief presentation](http://wish-it.se/hip/singularity2) I made in January. Some parts will be released this year. One of the goals is for instance to generalize the concept of free software to [free hardware](http://wish-it.se/freecomputer).  PS. later that year I told my house doctor about the experience, and he immediately wanted to do CRT and NMR imaging of my brain , and the results perfect, not one single artifact  ! :-)   ---------------------------   1. It was first in 2009 I finally recognized the picture I had seen 1987 over my whole wall, like 2x2m, during around 3 min, with heavy convulsions and cold sweat, the picture[2] I finally recognized was the front page of Keith Curtis book [After the Software Wars](http://keithcu.com/wordpress/?page_id=407), but without the title.      2. the picture on the front page of the book is part of a larger artwork made by Nils Seifert named [Metropolis 2208](http://thmc.deviantart.com/art/Metropolis-2208-75669429)    [3]      3. the name Metropolis also was a direct association to the highly visionary and dystopic scenario in Fritz Lang's movie [Metropolis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolis_%28film%29) from 1927, where advaced technology and artificial intelligence was use to control and supervise people instead of helping people. This movie I have during many years used as a metaphor over today's dystopic society where technology is used just like that, to control and supervise people, instead of helping people.

t5_2sekm,Jack_Vermicelli,1338443241,"&gt; But if your biology says you should be a woman when your body is male, then why would people assume you are a man.  Bodies don't magically do something other than what biology dicates. Bodies are formed through and because of their biology, not in spite of it. It's like you're saying ""But if the blueprints say it should be a castle when the finished structure is a barn, then why would people assume it's a barn.""  &gt; A biologist would not call them intersexed. Doctors would not call them intersexed.  If we're still talking about hermaphrodites, then yes, a biologist or a doctor or an anatomist would. If genitalia of both sexes are present, that is by definition intersexed. Not as simple male or female, or possibly both if you like, but not strictly and exactly either.  From [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex#Sex_determination):          Sometimes an organism's development is intermediate between male and female, a condition called intersex.  &gt; Hermaphrodites have on their birth certificate the gender they will be raised, not 'intersex' or 'genderqueer'.  That's because birth certificates give weight to social consideration, not strict biological adherence.  &gt; That is a biological fact, they are considered female  [Female (‚ôÄ) is the sex of an organism, or a part of an organism, which produces non-mobile ova (egg cells).](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female) Female is a *sex*, not a gender. Sure, people can be born sterile or have hysterectomies, but ""female"" is defined, not a matter of mindset or personality. (Anyone can be ""*feminine*"" in *gender*, however.)  &gt; Gender and sex are different.  Of course. I've said no different, all along.",34407,164,0,0,1,1,‚ôÄ

t5_2qh6c,aim2free,1338459785,"Regarding ""teachings"", remember:   *  ‚ÄúBelieve nothing, no matter where you read it, or who said it, no matter if I have said it, unless it agrees with your own reason and your own common sense.‚Äù      * ‚ÄúThe whole secret of existence is to have no fear. Never fear what will become of you, depend on no one. Only the moment you reject all help are you freed.‚Äù      * ‚ÄúThousands of candles can be lit from a single candle, and the life of the candle will not be shortened. Happiness never decreases by being shared.‚Äù      The most important of everything in Buddhism is the first quote.  &gt; Does Christianity require that one believes in an unchanging soul/self?      Do not ask what ""Christianity"" requires, use your logic and common sense, this is also what Jesus asked for, follow the truth! The world is full of deceivers.  &gt; What of the afterlife?      afaik Jesus did not say much about this, and if he said, then it is still not to be taken for granted that he actually said it. The reason why he didn't talk about it is most likely due to not actually knowing. He only knew that if you follow the truth (i.e. what makes sense and is logical) then you are going to live forever.  Seen pragmatically from a computer scientist's view, this makes sense, and is consistent with the Buddhist view, as what defines you, is your software, the architecture of your brain logic, which makes you behave well, or behave bad.  A good architecture can be reused, and further refined. However, as you certainly don't know anyone who can in detail remember their previous life, your worries about afterlife should be no worry.  Heaven is here, this is the only thing we can take for granted, and if heaven is here on Earth, the afterlife is consistent with your belief about reincarnation.  It is said in the end of the Revelation    * 21:1 And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea.   * 21:2 And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.   * 21:3 And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God.  So don't worry, everything of your Buddhist experiences is compatible with pure Christian Love and logic.   FYI: I had a visual experience, my only such experience during my whole life, in 1987,  when I saw a picture I didn't recognize until a couple of years ago).  The following is an extract of a [comment about this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/uai4r/wife_says_shell_divorce_me_if_i_become_christian/c4u6a5g) I made yesterday:   1. It was first in 2009 I finally recognized the picture I had seen 1987 over my whole wall, like 2x2m, during around 3 min, with heavy convulsions and cold sweat, the picture[2] I finally recognized was the front page of Keith Curtis book [After the Software Wars](http://keithcu.com/wordpress/?page_id=407), but without the title.      2. the picture on the front page of the book is part of a larger artwork made by Nils Seifert named [Metropolis 2208](http://thmc.deviantart.com/art/Metropolis-2208-75669429)    [3]      3. the name Metropolis also was a direct association to the highly visionary and dystopic scenario in Fritz Lang's movie [Metropolis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolis_%28film%29) from 1927, where advaced technology and artificial intelligence was use to control and supervise people instead of helping people. This movie I have during many years used as a metaphor over today's dystopic society where technology is used just like that, to control and supervise people, instead of helping people.

Their website (under the carefully-worded section daintily called *Why are GMs more expensive?*) opens with the proud statement that by lasting three to five times longer than regular pointe shoes, GMs are actually cheaper. Which, perhaps, they are. But they're also really really crap.   Why is something so expensive so very crap, you ask? I don't know. Maybe the materials required to manufacture an elastometric box and cushioning made from utherane foam is more expensive than paper machier. That, and the fact that convincing an already-suspicious clientele takes work. Clearly, making them from utherane foam and telling us about it isn't enough. No, they have to use Rogers Corporation's Poron¬Æ 4000 cushioning and the American Podiatric Association's Seal of Acceptance doesn't come cheap. Nor does forking out the dough for poor students at the University of Massachusetts (who really, I can imagine, have better things to do) to measure how many more relev√©s en pointe a GM shoe can endure versus a regular pointe shoe. Again, yes, more relev√©s= longer-lasting shoe. Virtually unbreakable shanks will do that. But I'm still not quite convinced that's a price to pay for broken ankles. (Eh, I suppose I have to admit the overall quality of the satin is also very high- mine never ripped and shredded like it did with all other shoes)  TIL bullshitting people gets really really expensive.  On a separate note, I'm not sure your salesperson was really in a position to recommend Grishkos off the top of his head. While they're clearly a better shoe than GMs (not hard), they're not suited to every foot.   ",21630,9447,0,0,1,1,¬Æ
