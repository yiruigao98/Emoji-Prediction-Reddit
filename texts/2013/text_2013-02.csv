t5_2rfxx,SausserTausser,1359679226,"Oh, I actually have a lot of experience with all of the ADCs and I know all about Caitlyn. She's one of my go-to champs for potentially risky lanes.  My point is that it seems like Riot is targeting Ezreal for nerfs because he's the most popular ADC, and I feel like they need to instead look more into why.  Why are Caitlyn, Miss Fortune, Graves, and Ezreal so much more popular than the others by a huge margin with Graves, the lowest played of the 4 still being played twice as often as the next most popular?   What it really comes down to is that  All of these champions are strong in lane.  All of them with the exception of MF are relatively safe (Graves is a bit iffy on this too though, and when it comes to MF all you really do is cast bullet time into the enemy team in team fights anyways.)  All of them except for Caitlyn are strong(est) in the mid game (Ez and Graves shine in the mid game, Caitlyn can actually do okay here if she stomped her lane or is with Nunu, and MF becomes weaker than her lane phase but I mean lolol bullet time lolol) where the majority of games are decided.  My worst fear is that Riot does not understand that it isn't so much that Ezreal is OP that makes him so popular, but the playstyle that fits Ezreal as an ADC is one of the most effective for the role at the moment, and really, win-rates suggest that **Curse of the Sad Bullet Time™** and **Farming with Caitlyn™ feat. special guest Nunu** are more effective.  Unless something changes and AD carries become less susceptible to bruiser rape-trains, or games stop being majorly decided in the mid game / lane phase, the most popular AD carries will always be the ones that excel in those attributes. If Riot wants the other ADCs to see more play, they need to either buff them directly, or change the core of the current meta.",™

I guess I'll spend that on a 6' Monster™ XLR cable for super extra high def audio. Bwaha.  Anyways, thanks for the help, man.  I've had much better luck here on Reddit than some other spots on the web.  All sorta retardedness ranging from ""you dont need a preamp dude"" to ""Be gone, worthless scum! Neve or die!"". Ok, not quite, but you get the idea.  I've not had a chance to hear the GAP73 in person. I've heard some tests online,etc, but haven't heard it on my own setup, etc etc.  From what I read and sorta-hear, it's a pretty colorful little piece of kit. Should be a welcome change here.  Does the ""color"" increase with input gain linearly, or is there some magical spot on the dial where it goes from ""meh, not bad"" to full blown technicolor rainbow?  Bit of a long shot here, have you used or heard the [Great River ME-1NV](http://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/ME1NV)?  I know the 1NV and the GAP73 are on different worlds sonically, which is reflected in the difference in price.  1NV is sorta ""1073 inspired"", and have even heard some argue that it's better than even the original 1073's.  Pretty fucking lofty statement, that.  I wonder *how* much better it is. Or if there is some specific situation in which the GAP is actually better suited than the Great River.  Been considering getting the 1NV, but I can't justify laying down that much on a single channel until I got a more respectable mic locker.  Just curios! Looking to bullshit about big boy toys.  Thanks in advance for any info!",™

t5_2qh16,yer_momma,1359705186,"While this article doesn't include the details, in the post yesterday discussing this topic the user stated that the $30 a month was only for 15Mb speeds.  So let's do some math...    $30 a month for 15Mb down and probably only 1 or 2Mb up or $70 a month for 1000Mb down and 1000Mb up.  So google costs 7 cents per Mb and Time Warner costs $2 dollars per Mb.   ☺ Doesn't really sound like competition.    Edit: a lot of people are pointing out that $70 a month is actually quite a bit to pay for internet regardless of the speeds because very few users will actually use that, and I tend to agree.  I'd rather have 100Mb google fiber for $20-30 a month than 1000Mb for $70.  Their free 5Mb package is a bit too slow for modern day usage and something in the middle would be nice.",☺

t5_2qh2p,Soltheron,1359752471,"&gt;And it's not just America, the majority of white people across the entire Earth are Christians.   Here in Scandinavia, religiosity is—when it is actually present—kept private to the point where you can know people for decades without finding out whether they believe in any Gods or not as long as you don't outright ask (which is considered rude if you don't know them very well). Regardless, we're extremely atheistic in general, and I don't think I need to convince you of the many beneficial statistics we can boast about over here, as I'm sure you're aware.  Atheism correlates with [a lot of things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PEmSLoDwiQ) including having more progressive individuals overall. That doesn't mean there aren't plenty of reasonable theists that are exactly the same, but it does mean that you'll see more support for LGBTQ rights coming from atheists if you look at the big picture.  That's not to say that sexism, for example, isn't a problem within the atheist movements, as that seems to be the case.  As well, within atheism you'll also find groups like libertarians that claim they're socially liberal but then turn around and advocate measures that will have pretty negative effects on minorities in particular (cutting back on welfare, allowing discrimination to occur and having it regulated by the Invisible Hand™ instead, hallowed be Its name, dismantling any kind of Affirmative Action policy, letting the markets freely set the terms so that a race to the bottom will occur, etc, etc...).  In short, as I already said: atheism is not a label that automatically makes you a magical, social justice Warrior of Light, but there *are* a couple more of them.  Also, excuse me for missing the reference to the FSM; I'm usually pretty good with catching references...",™

t5_2qyn1,Formicidae,1359786006,"As far as locating the bastards without DFHack, well, it won't really be pretty.  I'd dig out 1-square wide ""test channels"" every 10 levels, staggered in a grid.  I'd start down around -30.  Dig out a really long level horizontally or vertically, and then every 10 (spaced out quickly with the Shift key) I'd run branching 1-square wide corridors perpendicular.  They shouldn't take too long to dig out, and you'll have the added bonus of finding some metal veins.  Like I said; it won't be pretty, but thinking pretty is for the elves.  Now, as to getting wells and magma forges set up!  They're set up similarly; I'll just describe making a well, as magma has a workaround (see below).  First, make a few Grates at the Mason's shop (preferably out of [magma-safe](http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/DF2012:Magma-safe) stone).  Now, you'll need *two* levels around cave water.  Generally, I use the level where surface water is and the level just below.  On the top level, dig out an area for the well room.  It should be a decent size, but doesn't have to be gigantic.  You could get by with a 2x1 room, but that's not very dwarfy.  Make it cool.  Now, on that top level, *channel* out where you want your well to go.  You could curve it around the edge of the room, you could have it run straight through, or whatever you want.  Once those are done, you'll need to get the bottom level done.  To do that, connect your channels to the square *just outside* of the water.  In other words, don't break through the blinking blue wall, but stop right at it.  On that spot, dig an upwards staircase.  On the spot above, dig your downward staircase, and then connect it back to either your staircase or your well room.  You won't be using this corridor at all once the well room is set up.  Once that's done, remove the up-ramps on the bottom level left over from the channeling.  It's in the Designations menu, [d]-[z].  When you look down from the top level, you should see ""open space"" below.  That's where your water will be.  If you want, Dump [d]-[b]-[d] all the stone in the bottom level so it's not wasted; make sure you have a Garbage Dump [i]-[g] set up.  You can reclaim those stones later.  Once the water comes in, you ain't getting it back...easily.  Now, place a Wall Grate [b]-[W] on the bottom level, right next to the staircase.  You could put it further away, but sometimes the pressure from the torrent of water you're about to unleash (oh yeah...find a disposable dwarf) knocks the dwarf unconscious before he can get to the stairwell, and he drowns.  Grate set in place?  Got that disposable dwarf?  Good.  Set him as the *only* engraver in the fortress, and disable all of his other jobs.  I wouldn't use your main engraver for this task.  Under the Designations menu, Smooth Stone [d]-[s] the stone on the bottom level you're going to want to be the opening into the cavern water.  Wait for that to be done; it should happen quickly, as your Disposadwarf!™ doesn't have anything else to do.  Now comes the nail-biting step!  Under the Designations menu, Carve Fortifications [d]-[a] where you smoothed the stone.  That lets water through, but it will also keep most enemies out.  Sometimes, enemies can get through, though, which is why we installed that additional Wall Grate.  Now, cross your fingers.  As soon as the fortification is carved, water will start to rush in.  Your Disposadwarf!™ will hopefully have climbed the staircase and be happily walking towards the dining hall for a celebratory drink.  The water will flow across the upwards stairway, through your wall grate, and start to fill the corridor you carved out.  On the top level, you should start to see blue water as it comes through where the open spaces were.  Get a Mason to make a 1x1 Wall to plug up the corridor your Disposadwarf!™ escaped from; that way, your new well will be totally sealed off from the caverns.  Final step!  Designate your new Well Room as a water source with the Zones menu, [i]-[w].  Make sure to highlight every space that borders the water.  ...and get the Disposadwarf!™ ready for the magma channels!  To make WELLS that drop down into your well room, just dig and channel your way downwards until there's a clear z-path from the level you want to water.  Read up on how to do that [here](http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Well).  It's useful to have a well on the same level as your hospital, so water is always close-by; if you need to, you can dig out more well rooms below to line up your well location to the water below.  Always try to have your well drop into a *safe* area, though, because flying monsters could fly up an unguarded well shaft.  For magma, the workaround is simple.  Dig down to magma (warm stone located).  Dig a staircase down anyway.  You should breach the magma pools.  Mine around it and close up with a floor quickly before Fun gets up.  Then just dig your workshop and channel where you need to put your forges.  You could also do the same well technique desribed above, though, if you wanted a custom room (or if there was a magma pillar you wanted to tap into higher up).  *Edit:* [Upper Level](http://i.imgur.com/3pSWeR8), [Lower Level](http://i.imgur.com/r4tTFB1) -- Notice how my bottom level doesn't connect to the staircase at *all*; I got down there by channelling out the top part, then letting the miner dig his way up the stairs and back to the upper level via the escape route.  You could also watch Capn. Duck do it, I believe he starts around the 21:00 minute mark in [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38F9d_prgBc).  If you *REALLY* want, I could do step-by-step pictures.  Tomorrow.  I'm sleepy now.",™

Nevertheless, we are ready to deliver! ^__^   At **16:00 CET today** (Sat 2nd February 2013), we are going live with the **BelleNOiR's Followers Tournament #5**.   **What is it?**  It is a 16 player single elimination tournament with BO3 bracket and BO5 finals. It is designed to provide high profile competitive environment for the stream fans and amateur Starcraft 2 enthusiasts, with decent prize money to make it worth every players time. As such the event is open up to every amateur player out there - no pros allowed haha :D   **Why only amateurs?**  I and my team firmly, with all my soul, believe that fostering the amateur side of SC2 eSports scene is crucial in keeping this thing growing and alive. We also believe, that even amateur players train as hard as the pros and they should be rewarded accordingly for their efforts. That is why we decided to do this.  **Total prize-pool is $100 dollars distributed as follows:**   1st place: $32  2nd place: $16  3rd place: $8  4th - 16th place: $4    We have gotten around 40 sign-ups, but only 16 players were fast enough to make it into the bracket. The level of players is pretty high so the competition is bound to be fierce :D   If you would like to have more information, you can check out the thread on TL here: http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=386094.   Stream will go live at 16:00 CET today here: http://www.twitch.tv/bellenoir. Event will be casted by BelleNOiR &amp; Wardí (from the sc2improve community in UK)   We heartily invite you to come watch the players clash as they are clawing their way through the bracket to try and take the grand prize. But really - for some of them this is more about honor, than money. As it should be.   Hope to see you guys in the audience and in the meantime:   GL &amp; HF, stay safe and remember to storm first and ask questions later! ♥   BelleNOiR",♥

t5_2qh13,brokor21,1359829531,"So we reached the same conclusion. The fault lies with everyone in Greece.  There is no excuse for not paying taxes in this country. It's like saying i won't change the oil in my car cause it is old and rusty anyway.   I agree that the state is corrupt, yet the main reason and incentive to instigate this corruption is to keep people on the government payroll. We blame the government yet not only are we as much to blame for what has happened the past decades, we are actually the main beneficiaries of the government's sins. I understand people who avoid taxes aswell, but only because i know their sense of entitlement, i don't think their behaviour can ever be excused. When i get my tax report in the end of the year, i am ofcourse crying over my money that went to the bureaucrats, which is like crying over spilled milk. I try to rationalize it somehow (it usually goes like: i get free education for as much as i would pay in the US for a yearly program, and idd my institution is pretty decent for a free university) but in the end i am giving away my money to the bloated government which does nothing but make my everyday life and business more difficult with always changing laws and services. Still in order to have the right to do business on this soil i ought to pay this government money. after all my own business depends on the greek market, and if the government stopped paying to create the middle class i would be out of business.  It is a vicious cycle, and in order for smth to change there must be brave reforms in every single government sector and every market that is now monopolized by the government. Leading on to the carved path of the past will get us anywhere but where we are right now. Problem is that every proposal i have seen for Change™ for the universities, the energy sector, the tax code, the agricultural development, public transport, even the post office, has been shot down with no reason but ""if it ain't broken don't fix it"". Yet things all around remain broken but we don't notice.  And what saddens me the most that the first people to always fight these reforms are the young people. They have an idea about their future, instilled onto them by the media and their parents, that when this idea is replaced or menaced, they lash out at everyone and anyone. The youth in Greece is by far the most conservative part of the population, and the most unlawful in the same time.   All in all, paying taxes is not an option, or a chore. It is a responsibility and a duty as a citizen of this fucked up country. ",™

In the Northeast there are more ice rinks and more naturally occurring situations of ice, higher supply. Also since people in the Northeast already play there's an increased amount of gear to buy used and the demand for gear generally brings the prices down since stores have to be competitive. Leagues are also cheaper up north(winter league here in Richmond, VA is $700 and Richmond is a couple notches up the north ladder than where I grew up). Speaking as someone in the South™ I can tell you everything down here hockey related is more expensive than for my friends up in say Boston because you have to buy it at specialty shops or have it special ordered, unless you buy it online from the big sites that are all based up north. It's hard to even just try playing hockey down here without committing a decent amount of money up front.  Another point, median income for the New England states is a close to $10,000 higher than the median income for southern states and then the nationwide disparity between white and black income, which is especially noticeable in...you guessed it, the American South.  I feel like Canada would like to argue the point of black people don't play hockey.  This came off more snarky than I intended it to, but I'm entirely too lazy to edit it.",™

t5_2s46m,Papander,1359842205,"First take a shower to soften the beard. If you don't want to take a shower, then apply a warm wet towel on your face and keep it there 2-3 minutes. You want to hydrate the beard, which makes it easier to cut the hair.  Wash your face with a high-glycerin soap (e.g., Musgo Real Glyce Lime Oil soap (MR GLO), $6.50/bar, or Whole Foods 365 brand glycerin soap, $2/bar, or Dr. Bronner's bar soap, or Clearly Natural glycerin soap), using your hands, rinsing partially with a splash. [Leisureguy™.](http://www.reddit.com/r/wicked_edge/comments/15eqbh/my_so_got_me_a_starter_kit/c7lz76u)  Washing your face with facial cleanser is another option, which works for me.  Use traditional shaving cream/soap combined with a shaving brush to create the shaving lather.  Shave first with the grain. Once done rinse with warm water, re-apply the lather with the shaving brush. For the second pass shave across the grain or against the grain, depending on which is better for your skin.  Rinse with cold water, apply alum block/witch hazel/afershave. Finish by using a moisturizer with SPF.",™

Long-term safety and efficacy often need to be inferred from non-random population studies.  The author wasn't trying to conclude anything about piracetam, he's just showing the data and wondering the cause.  &gt;In conclusion, even though some points remain unclear, in particular the reason for the stronger decline observed in the piracetam group, or the question of a possible dose-effect of EGb761® that could not be presently tested, this study reports a beneficial effect of EGb761® on long-term cognitive decline as assessed by the MMSE in non-demented elderly people.

It only means that you should have your own opinions about any work, whether that be in literature, music, visual, theatre, or whatever art form you are considering.  When appreciating any type of art you need to ask yourself if you like it. After all can you say that you like every piece of music that you listen to, or every book you pick up? Art is like this, it is experienced differently by every person.  Although you don’t need anyone to tell you how to react to art, there is also a bit of truth in the saying, knowledge is power. When you read more about art and what the different art movements were and how they affect art and artists today, you will know more about why an artist presented his work in a certain way, and you will be better able to appreciate the art for what it really is, whether you like it personally or not. The more you learn about art the less distant and strange it will be to you.  * https://sites.google.com/a/kent.edu/jwattles/home/aesthetics/hegels-aesthetics  Hegel’s Aesthetics: Lectures on Fine Art.  Introduction   * http://silenteloquence.suryaonline.org/2005/02/22/why-do-we-appreciate-art/  We enjoy art. We try to produce art. We collect art. We admire those who create art. What is it that makes us so drawn to art?   * http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=the-neuroscience-of-beauty   The notion of “the aesthetic” is a concept from the philosophy of art of the 18th century according to which the perception of beauty occurs by means of a special process distinct from the appraisal of ordinary objects. Hence, our appreciation of a sublime painting is presumed to be cognitively distinct from our appreciation of, say, an apple. The field of “neuroaesthetics” has adopted this distinction between art and non-art objects by seeking to identify brain areas that specifically mediate the aesthetic appreciation of artworks.   * http://thedorseypost.com/?p=800 The column is a classic reaction to a lot of modern and contemporary art: why is this art? A book could be written about why this question is maybe the only one that matters right now, both to those who think an unhewn rock, an object found in nature, could serve as art, and for those who think it’s a fraud. I think the more interesting question lies in this fellow’s common assumption that one needs an advanced education to appreciate art, which is part of what’s embedded in that query about the nature of art.  I don’t think anyone would argue with the fact that you need a bit of study to appreciate art now. When it comes to a lot of what’s emerged over the past century, you need to know how art evolved in the West over the past two thousand years or you can’t fully understand what has happened to art in the 20th and 21st centuries.  This isn’t the case with Greek sculpture, or Giotto, or the Sistine Chapel, or Bruegel, or Vermeer . . . you can pick when you think the shift happened, but it’s most likely in the 19th century.   * http://www.lifehack.org/articles/lifestyle/how-to-read-a-painting.html  Art is a great status symbol in modern society and because of that it can be quite intimidating to the casual viewer. For many the first impulse is to blow it off, to see it as a worthless plaything for the rich and boring. This is too bad, not only because art can be a great source of pleasure in our lives, but because even a passing acquaintance with art can enrich and deepen our understanding of the world around us. Fortunately, developing a casual understanding of art is not all that difficult. It is true that some people devote their entire lives to studying the minutest details of an artists’ work, but there’s no need to become an expert to have a meaningful relationship with art. All it takes is a moderate attention to detail, a little bit of patience, and a willingness to reflect on your own feelings.   * http://www.combibo.net/articles/common_concepts_used_when_evaluating_artwork/  To enjoy and appreciate art, you do not need any special degrees or higher learning, but if you spend any time reading about or researching artwork, you are likely to come across a number of terms on a regular basis. Understanding what these terms mean will probably not make you appreciate the art anymore, but it will provide a basis for explaining why you like a piece of artwork or understanding others interpretations of a specific piece of artwork.  * http://users.rowan.edu/~millere/Introduction%20to%20Aesthetics.htm  Aesthetics is closely related to the concept of aesthetic experience. Baumgarten who coined the term aesthetics, claimed that humans experience the world in two fundamentally ways—logically and aesthetically.  Logically—that is a thorn, it will hurt if it pricks me  Aesthetically—enjoying a sunset, looking at seashells, enjoying a work of art. These things are beautiful because you are looking at them aesthetically.     What we call art, or more properly fine art, is therefore, according to the 18th +19th century tradition of the aesthetic, those objects made by humans to be enjoyed aesthetically. So, Paleolithic European cave paintings, Native American wood carvings are not really art according to some because they were made by people before the emergence of aesthetic experience.   ",©

t5_2qh2p,Dudesan,1359915960,"I've heard many christians claim that there's a distinction between ""moral, civil, and ceremonial laws"", but not one *has ever* been able to give me a straight answer about how they tell the difference between the three. It's clearly about what they find personally distasteful or silly, but admitting that that was the case would rather undermine their positions, so don't expect them to admit it. Apart from a few commands which were explicitly intended for a specific people at a specific time, there is absolutely nothing to indicate that most of these laws weren't supposed to be binding for everyone for all time. Indeed, in many places (See Leviticus 23:21, or 1 Samuel 15:29, for example), it's explicitly stated that they *are*.  Remember, many Christians find it more comfortable to believe in a god who doesn't condone, command or commit murder, slavery, rape, child abuse, animal abuse, arson, torture, ritual mutilation, fratricide, patricide, matricide, infanticide, genocide, and so on than to believe in one who does.   Unfortunately, since the Bible (Old Testamant and New) is pretty clear about Yahweh's position on these things, holding a belief in Loving Hippie Jesus™ requires ignoring huge portions of it. Or just never reading it in the first place, which seems to be the most popular option.  Well, let's see what Jesus has to say about that:  &gt;“Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished.  (Matthew 5:17-18, NIV)  Some Christians claim that his death and resurrection ""fulfill"" this. That is bullshit for one simple reason: last time I checked, Heaven and Earth haven't passed away.  Jesus also made his views on people ""picking and choosing"" quite clear:  &gt;[Jesus] answered them, “And why do you break God’s commandment because of your tradition? For God said:    *Honor your father and your mother;* and, *The one who speaks evil of father or mother must be put to death.*  &gt; But you say, ‘Whoever tells his father or mother, “Whatever benefit you might have received from me is a gift committed to the temple”—  he does not have to honor his father.’ In this way, you have revoked God’s word because of your tradition. Hypocrites! Isaiah prophesied correctly about you when he said:    &gt;These people honor Me with their lips, but their heart is far from Me.  They worship Me in vain, teaching as doctrines the commands of men.”  (Matthew 15:3-9, NIV)   Looks like Jesus has quite a bit to say about people who ignore commandments, in fact. But maybe it's just Matthew?  &gt;It is easier for heaven and earth to disappear than for the least stroke of a pen to drop out of the Law.  (Luke 16:17, NIV)  Okay, so Jesus is a bust. Let's see what the Epistles have to say about the Mosaic Code:  &gt; If you really keep the royal law found in Scripture, “Love your neighbor as yourself,” you are doing right.  But if you show favoritism, you sin and are convicted by the law as lawbreakers. For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it.   (James 2:8-10, NIV)  &gt;All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness,  (2 Timothy 3:16)  &gt;Do we, then, nullify the law by this faith? Not at all! Rather, we uphold the law.  (Romans 3:31)  &gt;Know this first of all, that *there is no prophecy of scripture that is a matter of personal interpretation*, for no prophecy ever came through human will; but rather human beings moved by the holy Spirit spoke under the influence of God.""  (2 Peter 1:20-21 NAB)   ----  Well, shit.   This problem disappears quite quickly if you assert that most of the Bible is hogwash, and you only care about the good parts. If you prefer to cling to it as an inspired document, vague mutterings about ""context"" or about Jesus abolishing the old Law won't get you anywhere.",™

It has been my experience that if you level with people and try to understand them then you are able to treat them with respect, and they will likely do the same in return. People in the southern United States are known for their friendliness and hospitality. That's not my opinion, it's a practical fact. I'm not necessarily assuming that you don't do that already. I'm just responding to the attitude of ""can't wait to get out"". It's a pretty popular thing for people in this area to do. They go full speed in the opposite direction of their parents and family because they don't agree with them in some areas.  I am just reminding you that Knoxville is still a beautiful city and there are many well meaning, friendly people here. The south is also fantastic. I would never want to live somewhere else. The weather, foliage, music, culture, food, architecture and people give this area it's character and it's history. I have learned to forgive others for their opinions and not to pre-judge anyone. Their entire lives people have told them to think one way. Those people were kind to them. They were family and friends to them.   If you want to change things you will need to do more than just talk trash about them and plot your ""escape"". Otherwise, why would they listen to you over those that they love? All of this is just food for thought. I don't know you personally and I can't judge you by anything more than your words.

t5_2ssp3,carcajada,1359951965,"Well, that's tricky. You get into muddled waters quickly once discussing what leaders were real communists and which weren't. For example, Marx would have considered Lenin's revolution extremely premature, as Russia lacked the developed proletariat necessary to seize the means of production - Lenin's innovation, to share power in soviets (councils) of workers AND peasants would have been anathema to Marx, as peasants were backward, inherently conservative and lacked proper class consciousness. Hence the formation of ""Marxism-Leninism"" which was already arguably not real communism in the early 1920s. Then Lenin himself turned toward a more open economy in the NEP years. Stalin, a thoroughgoing communist, decided that socialism could be achieved in one country (previously the theory had assumed international working-class solidarity and the simultaneity of revolutions - when that failed to happen in the 1920s the Soviets adopted a more isolationist posture). Communist parties in the west often eschewed revolutionary tactics - but still thought of themselves as good communists. No doubt in Xiaoping's case he acted like Kruschev had after Stalin - facing a society, economy and state structure/bureaucracy that, aside from accumulating power and wealth in the hands of a very few in party leadership (an anti-egalitarian outcome that would incense any proper communist) was actively undermining the country itself. China never really industrialized or created an urban, educated working class till the reforms of Xiaoping - and that class is necessary for the eventual arrival of communism. Moreover it made China strong, and far wealthier. If it navigates its *many* problems over the next few decades, Deng Xiaoping may well emerge as, on balance, not just the greatest communist leader, but ultimately the most beneficent, far-seeing and prudent statesman of the last millenium. Given the hundreds of millions of better-off Chinese, I don't think that's an over-statement, hyperbolic though I know it sounds. 😊",😊

t5_2qh4u,oculus42,1359953097,"First, let me give you a bit of background on me. I've been using Apple computers since 1986, Macs since 1992, and PCs since 1994. I assemble my own PCs, and have since 1998.I've used Windows since 3.11, Mac OS since 6.0.4, and various UNIX &amp; Linux flavors. I currently have a MacBook Pro, two Dell laptops, a custom-built PC, an iPad 2 and an iPhone. I'm a big fan of Macs.  Also, please understand Apple has multiple ""branches"". Microsoft is mostly a software company (that makes keyboards and mice and Xbox 360s), while Apple is a hardware company. Apple is *vertically integrated* — they produce the hardware, the OS, and much of the software for their computers. That works really well for them. Apple has tight control so they can provide a ""just works"" experience. Part of the cost of a Macintosh is the software they build to work with their hardware. The same is true of iPhones, iPads, and iPods. Apple's tight control does cause some restrictions, but it allows them a more seamless user experience. Don't get me wrong, I think Android is doing some amazing things (look at the Google Voice and Skype integration) and Apple will have to open up some avenues to meet the competition.  On to the real issues:  Right off, I'm striking as pure crap lines like ""they trick stupid people…"" They are pure bias. All Mac users are stupid people? Thats a lazy insult. They could have easily have written ""Your mother!""  1. **Apple does not charge for software updates.** They *used to*, and only for certain updates. I recall the early iOS updates and the 802.11n upgrade for the 2006 wireless chipsets. The misconception centers on Apple's OS version numbers. Each 10.x release of OS X is a *major release*. The same is actually true of Windows. Vista is 6.0, Windows 7 is 6.1, Windows 8 is actually just 6.2. You can look in the OS directly, or, if you trust Wikipedia, they'll tell you the same. Everything else is marketing. Apple used to charge about the same as Microsoft for each new version, but now charges much less ($20) the licensing allows you to install one copy on all of your Macs.  2. **FOXCONN makes most computers** Most electronics are made in Shenzhen, Guangdong, China — basically an industrial super-city. Dell used to build computers here, but now uses Hon Hai, because they're cheaper. Except *Hon Hai is FOXCONN*. It's hard to beat the concentrated electronics manufacturing power and experience in Guangdong. If you buy an Intel-branded motherboard, a Lenovo, a Dell, an Alienware (still a Dell), or a Mac, it's probably made in the same little corner of China. Apple also uses Samsung, LG, TSMC, and a dozen other companies for parts and assembly. They've even brought some assembly back to the US… so has Lenovo. There are few manufacturers out there, and most computer companies use the same ones. Samsung is pretty much the only end-to-end manufacturer, producing processors, memory, displays, and selling their own end products. This probably helps Samsung make great products. Note that Samsung and Apple sell the top five most popular smartphones (2 Samsung, 3 Apple).  3. **Apple uses less DRM than Microsoft** Apple has never used DRM on Mac OS and provides OS &amp; software updates free, even on Hackintosh computers. Microsoft locked down Windows with activation DRM &amp; only offers security updates to activated copies. Apple's App Stores provide free, central updates. I own a copy of Pages and don't have to worry about upgrades or subscriptions to stay up-to-date like Microsoft would have you do with Office365. I can install my iOS apps on an unlimited number of devices. When Apple first came out with the iTunes Music Store, FairPlay DRM was a compromise to get record companies to agree to digital distribution. **DRM is a crappy compromise**, I will grant you. I used software to remove DRM wrappers from my older music. Apple doesn't sell DRM restricted music anymore. Their videos are still restricted, as are every legal source of downloadable video. Does the DRM benefit them? Yes and no. You need Apple software to play the videos, but not Apple hardware. You are more likely to keep buying from the vender because of lock-in, but the same is true of non-DRM sources. I am more likely to buy music from Apple, but I still buy on Amazon Music. I would be happier if Apple allowed people to jailbreak their iOS devices without violating their EULA. You should be able to muck around with your device if you want. You can, but it's is a legal grey area and not convenient, though whether convenient is a separate issue. Keep in mind that Microsoft is implementing a ""walled garden"" for Windows RT and Amazon a weak wall for the Fire (it allows third-party software installs).  4. **Apple computers are expensive** At similar specs, Macs are price competitive. There aren't many PCs sold at similar price points… Apple pretty much owns the greater-than-$1000 market. You can buy much cheaper PCs, but with much lower specs. With similarly specced PCs, Macs provide a lower total cost of ownership over their lifetimes. Even [the study Dell commissioned](http://www.principledtechnologies.com/Dell/E6510_MacBookPro15_TCO.pdf) produced a TCO advantage to Dell ($150 per machine) by buying a more expensive Mac copy of MS Office *twice* (which is the entire $150 difference for a single machine) and the assuming the environment was already using PCs and so had existing software and management practices in place.  5. **KHTML** This makes reference to Apple's first efforts to release their code back to the KHTML project. Since that time the relationship is much improved, and several major companies have contributed to the KHTML framework. Apple's KHTML implementation, [WebKit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebKit) drives virtually every smartphone and tablet produced today, some 40% of the browsers in use today use KHTML/WebKit as the rendering engine.  6. **Viruses** It is not Apple's policy to provide user support for malware, just like Dell, and HP, and Acer, and Toshiba… and Microsoft. Apple is in a unique situation that they also offer the OS, which makes them *the* company to turn to when your computer isn't working. And while their initial policy on infection was pretty harsh, it was no different from any other manufacturer. Viruses are really not the major threat anymore, it's trojan horses and other malware that trick you into approving their installation. And Apple has added some basic software signature checking to prevent the most common malware from running. It's no replacement for an antivirus package — several of which are available for Mac, both free and non-free — but it's something. Market share aside, Apple provides a better security model, making you stop and enter your password for installations. It's more intrusive, but also prevents the practically patented Microsoft Warning Click Through™. The User Account Control added in Vista is just another annoying dialog for a user to not read. They barrage of dialogs creates automatic responses. I've watched that impulse cause a technical support instructor to destroy a full week of work by blindly ignoring ""Are you sure you want to overwrite this new file with this old one?""    The paragraphs on the Apple row are mostly crap. I've mentioned FOXCONN already. They are not sweatshops, and Apple has pushed to improve conditions and reduce hours worked (to the dismay of some employees, many who move to Shenzhen to bank money for their families back home). The suicide rate among FOXCONN employees is below the national average. The hardware in Apple computers is far from outdated and inferior… as the largest computer company in the world their relationships with vendors and manufacturers get them hardware that doesn't even exist… Intel created a smaller chip package for the MacBook Air because Apple asked them to.  Macs are incompatible with Windows software, but there are Mac versions of most major software titles and thousands of equivalent and competitive apps available for Macs. Androids are also incompatible with ""most software on the market"" by that standard, but they're doing pretty well, too. ""Not recommended for offices, programming, or 3d modeling is a flat-out lie. Macs have a lower total cost of ownership for many businesses. Macs can be used to program in most languages (though writing software for Windows wouldn't be very convenient on them) and Apple makes the Xcode development suite available for free. Macs are commonly used for graphics and 3d modeling applications. Macs can also run Windows if you need to do so… Macs can natively connect to PC networks, can authenticate with Windows Domain Controllers, can communicate with Microsoft Exchange servers for email, can read and write Microsoft Office formats with free or purchased software (OpenOffice, Pages, Numbers, etc).   Those ""meaningless buzzwords"" are buzzwords, but aren't meaningless. Retina Displays are by no means required for most computing tasks (my only Retina display is on my iPhone) but the increase in  clarity and detail is really significant. Working with small text or detailed images, a Retina display takes a computer screen to the resolution equivalent of a printed page. If you haven't seen it, stop into an Apple store some time and try one out.  The ""Do the Math"" comparison on the picture at the bottom left is both telling and doesn't tell the whole story. The Dell pictured is less than half the processing power for less than half the price but an additional half-pound of weight. The Do The Math campaign is both old and dead now (being part of Windows 7) so we can't see how they really stacked up.   But lets see what Intel has to say: **[In the end, the choice comes down to personal preference.](http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/tech-tips-and-tricks/pc-vs-mac-the-big-debate.html)**.",™

When we cuddle I always smell him, he's the first person I've ever felt attracted to his natural scent and I'm the 1st to ever be into his scent. We both find it odd but I can't help myself!

t5_2qh1e,goonsack,1359968252,"That was my reaction as well. The speech is well done, no question, but it reminded me too much of the speeches where Hitler and Friends praise the farmers and laborers of the Reich in *Triumph of the Will*. If someone is singling you out and pontificating about you how special and exceptional you are, while invoking such notions as God and Country, they're probably trying to either control you, mollify you, manipulate you, (or sell you something! ha!). Plus, the fact that this old speech was being used in a contemporary car commercial was just a mind-bending anachronism. It evokes a vision of an America which doesn't really exist any longer. Sure there are still lots of family farms, but the dominant trend is towards corporate farming, agribusiness, and the use of migrant workers as farm laborers. But I'll shut my yap and go buy a new Truck™ now. Thank you Dodge. God bless America. Amen.",™

t5_2tx47,Baconbeercan5,1359983634,"I had this dream a few weeks back and I wrote it in my iPhone notes because it was so weird and entertaining. Here's what I wrote when I woke up (poor grammar included, my lazy apologies): ""I had the strangest dream last night. I was in NYC and there was a park. It wasn't Central Park though. It was called 'Albert Park' or something. Whatever, it was huge and I was there because James lived quite close to that location. To get to the point, there were these gigantic hammocks hanging from this extremely tall wooden structure in the park. In the hammocks was something mortifying (to me anyway). Animals. Not little pets like my Angel either, huge animals that you are likely to come across on a safari. The first ones I noticed were the lion and the deer who were being suspended by there midsection, paws hanging down. But then I saw the hammocks and the rest of the animals. From what I can remember there were giraffes and even elephants. They were all so frightened. I began screaming and telling James and his family to give me the name of the park and a mobile phone. They gave me one but for some stupid dream reason it was an early version of a mobile and I didn't want to use it because I needed the Internet (for the park name). They then told me it was'Albert Park' and I began running like crazy towards the hanging animals (who were still alive). At this point, a large crowd of people had formed around them. Then an explosion. An explosion from where the hammocks were. I began running back, pushing James along with me. I turned around and bits of the animals were being flung around everywhere. I ducked to the ground to avoid being hit by a moose antler, though it slightly struck me in my right arm. I didn't appear to be hurt.  People were yelling that this was a terrorist attack and then I was in a car. From the car we saw thick smoke from where the explosion was. We were driving away from that. There were masses of people on the streets. It seemed like it was the end of the world. People were sticking there heads out the windows in almost every building in order to see what was going on. Then I was at the train station, without James.😔 Blue trains, defaced with colorful graffiti were full of people escaping the city now in turmoil. I watched as a teenage girl jumped on and grabbed the last seat. They weren't letting anybody on after that. I tried my luck by running up the side of the train as it took off. I was hoping to get a seat next to the train driver. It would have been my way out. Though that seat was taken, taken by the large carry on the driver had put there. I stopped and the rest is a blur. I vaguely remember the dream being set in James' home with James being the last thing I can remember before I was woken by a phone call."" ",😔

t5_2qil2,jshholland,1359985157,"&gt;To vaccinate requires quantumly receiving (uploading) vaccination data via one PAK™ download once every 10 days on a CONTINUOUS BASIS due to the general life style of persons living in the malaria zones. The programs delivered have built-in “repeater programming” wherein the delivered programs are repeated several times a day for precisely 10 days. Maximum protection takes 6 months to acquire before the person vaccinated is fully protected. During the 6 month period it requires a person to become fully “immunized” against malaria, the person is still vulnerable to getting malaria. However, once the person begins the vaccination process, even early on, that person will have the important advantage that even the most virulent form of malaria will not cause that person’s fatality. However, after the person has received a full 6 months of vaccinations, it important that the person continues quantumly receiving (uploading) MalariaSafe™ vaccination data via PAK™ every 10 days as long as the person continues to reside in a malaria zone in order to remain safe from contracting malaria.

I first listened to your music a couple years ago while I was studying abroad in Brisbane, Australia where I had the pleasure of seeing one of your live performances at a small bar there. Amazing.   I was wondering if you could take the time to answer and clarify a few questions I had regarding your approach to music as was discussed in an emusician.com interview a year ago. I would really like some insight into your approach to see how great artists do it just as a point of reference.  You mention that you keep the ‘same rhythm section’ from song to song? Is this simply in reference to the kinds of drum hits you use as well as your sub-bass signal?  You also mention you ‘keep the same rhythm guitarist for every song as you play different leads on top of it’. Does this simply mean you keep the same sub signal as you play different top bass layers over it?  Also several times throughout the interview you mention ‘tops’. Is this in reference to high frequency drum hits like hats and cymbals or do you also mean top bass layers? Or Both?  IE. You mention ‘muscle beats’ that you cover with ‘bright, sharp, hi-passed tops’.  You also mention side-chain compression and to “duck from the snare..do a layered snare w/ kicks and mid-range synths and all kinds of stuff that goes away for a perfectly tuned crunch..having a dive on your hit that sits out and allows for the split second before you drop a heavy, steady, f-note covered w/ high freq. and midrange synths while you beat plays”.  The wording was a bit confusing to me in the above paraphrased quote. Do you mean that you layer your snares with synthesized sounds or do you mean to side chain compress your ‘kicks and mid-range synths and all kinds of stuff’ with the snare as the input? By ‘dive on your hit that sits out,’ you are simply referring to the ducking of various sounds as they move out of the way of the snare hit, correct?  Also in your response to ‘developing a custom sound’, you mention ‘picking a couple atonal dives”. What exactly do you mean by that? Like effects one-shots that pitch bend downward over an extended period of time?   If you could clarify my questions from that interview I would greatly appreciate it! ☺  Also in general, I was wondering how much did you learn from Ill.Gates?  What is your relationship like with other top producers in electronic dance music, particularly those involved with bass music?  How much resampling do you incorporate into designing your sounds? For drum hits? Bass?  Thank you for taking the time to respond to fans and I hope you can answer some of these questions!   Much love and respect!  -Hungry inspired bass fan ",☺

I've heard many christians claim that there's a distinction between ""moral, civil, and ceremonial laws"", but not one *has ever* been able to give me a straight answer about how they tell the difference between the three. It's clearly about what they find personally distasteful or silly, but admitting that that was the case would rather undermine their positions, so don't expect them to admit it. Apart from a few commands which were explicitly intended for a specific people at a specific time, there is absolutely nothing to indicate that most of these laws weren't supposed to be binding for everyone for all time. Indeed, in many places (See Leviticus 23:21, or 1 Samuel 15:29, for example), it's explicitly stated that they *are*.  Remember, many Christians find it more comfortable to believe in a god who doesn't condone, command or commit murder, slavery, rape, child abuse, animal abuse, arson, torture, ritual mutilation, fratricide, patricide, matricide, infanticide, genocide, and so on than to believe in one who does.   Unfortunately, since the Bible (Old Testamant and New) is pretty clear about Yahweh's position on these things, holding a belief in Loving Hippie Jesus™ requires ignoring huge portions of it. Or just never reading it in the first place, which seems to be the most popular option.  ",™

t5_2r2jt,JessicaGottlieb,1360017600,"You are correct but there's this [from the National Cancer Institute](http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Risk/HPV)  *Virtually all cervical cancers are caused by HPV infections, with just two HPV types, 16 and 18, responsible for about 70 percent of all cases (5, 6). HPV also causes anal cancer, with about 85 percent of all cases caused by HPV-16. HPV types 16 and 18 have also been found to cause close to half of vaginal, vulvar, and penile cancers (7).*  *Most recently, HPV infections have been found to cause cancer of the oropharynx, which is the middle part of the throat including the soft palate, the base of the tongue, and the tonsils. In the United States, more than half of the cancers diagnosed in the oropharynx are linked to HPV-16 (8).*  *The incidence of HPV-associated oropharyngeal cancer has increased during the past 20 years, especially among men. It has been estimated that, by 2020, HPV will cause more oropharyngeal cancers than cervical cancers in the United States (9).*  and  *The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved two HPV vaccines: Gardasil® for the prevention of cervical, anal, vulvar, and vaginal cancer, as well as precancerous lesions in these tissues and genital warts caused by HPV infection; and Cervarix® for the prevention of cervical cancer and precancerous cervical lesions caused by HPV infection. Both vaccines are highly effective in preventing infections with HPV types 16 and 18. Gardasil also prevents infection with HPV types 6 and 11. These vaccines have not been approved for prevention of penile or oropharyngeal cancer.*  Also both of my kids have had their first injections. I can't come up with a scenario where I would want to deny my kids this vaccine.   ",®
t5_2ss5b,AgonistAgent,1360018013,"Previously on My Little Shill:  ""Elements of Tyranny: see Ron Paul?"" said Twilight.  ""But Ron Paul can't win the presidency Twilight, he's a fringe canidate!"" replied Spike.  ""He's going to return Freedom™ to Equestria! President Obama must be informed at once!"" exclaimed Twilight, ""Spike, take a letter to the Reptilian Overlord...""  -----------------------------------  ""Soon, the Gold Standard will be returned to Equestria, and The Fed will collapse! Freedom™ shall reign again,"" said Ron Paul, laughing maniacally. And then he pulled out his copy of the constitution and cast a teleportation spell.  ""Oh no! Freedom™! We must stop him! Hey, random ponies that I just met, wanna go into the most dangerous place in Equestria looking for ancient magic that may or may not even exist?"" asked Twilight. The group nodded their heads and began on their adventure.  After walking by dozens upon dozens of FEMA internment camps, they finally arrived at the most dangerous location in all of Equestria: The DailyPaul forums. The forum was filled with goldbugs and conspiracy theorists who were free from President Obama's tyranny.  ""It's just not natural,"" said Applejack, ""ponies are supposed to be ruled by a tyrannical leader.""  ""I agree,"" said Twilight, ""but we have t--- OH NO! A SOVEREIGN CITIZEN.""  ""Hey mister, get out of our way or we're going to fine you!"" said Fluttershy.  ""But that goes against the Non-Aggression Principle,"" replied the Citizen.  ""Okay, I warned you,"" said Fluttershy. A hundred thousand tax documents appeared in the air and attacked the Citizen.  ""Oh nooo, coercion, my only weakness, I'm meltinggg!"" screamed the Sovereign Citizen as the fines stripped away his Freedom™.  ""Great job suppressing that innocent civilian,"" said Rainbow Dash, ""I just wish he was a Palestinian.""  ""Don't worry, I'm sure we'll find plenty of rich, white Equestrian males to oppress along the way,"" said Rarity, ""Oooh! Look! There's one now!""  Hoity Toity stood nearby, not bothering the group or applying any sort of aggression on them. Rarity took this as a cue to stab him with his horn.  ""I'm dying because I've been stabbed by a horn! And thanks to President Obama's inheritance taxes, the government will steal my money!"" screamed the innocent, rich, white, Equestrian male.  ""Mwahahahah"" said Rarity, ""all your money will go to the poor!""  ""NOOOOOO!!!"" said Hoity Toity with his last breath.  ""Hey Rarity, oppressing the rich is fun and all that, but we have some Elements of Tyranny to activate,"" said Twilight.  ""Hang on just one minute - I'm deciding if I should spend my welfare check on cigarettes or lottery tickets""  ""Fine. Just don't take too long.""  Having purchased both cigarettes and lottery tickets with the money stolen from the rich, Rarity and the group continued along the way.  ""There it is girls - the Federal Reserve, where the Elements of Tyranny reside. But some Palestinian protestors are on the bridge, blocking our home land bridge!""  ""Don't worry,"" said Rainbow Dash, ""I'll just kill them!""  And then Rainbow Dash turned into a bulldozer and ran over the protesters, flattening them. After killing them, she twiddled her Jew mustache and laughed in an evil, Zionist Jewish manner.  ""Anyone want pancakes? No? Okay then, lets get to the fed,"" said Rainbow Dash.  After a few boring and unnarrated minutes of walking to the Fed, they arrived in the Federal Reserve's mint. Among the stacks of worthless fiat currency rested several straw bundles - The Elements of Tyranny!  ""One, two, three, four, five... There's only five of them! I thought your book said there were six!"" said Pinkie Pie.  ""Well of course you would think there are six of them, you illiterate leech, you don't even need to read,"" snapped Twilight.  ""What's a leech? Oh well, it doesn't matter, daddy says that all I have to do is fill out a welfare form and then the goverment will give me all I need,"" said Pinkie.  ""Ugh... Anyway, the book said that when the five are together, a spark will reveal the sixth element!"" Twilight ignited her horn, sparks flying.  A bright light appeared, opening a brilliant, glowing portal. The American Eagle flew in through a window. It laid the Egg of Liberty™ and shed a single tear. The Egg of Liberty™ hatched into Ron Paul.  ""Mwahaha, I win!"" He snatched Twilight and then ran to the Federal Reserve Vault. Twilight's horn lit up again, but this time the sparks hit the Elements and they began to glow.  The Elements stopped glowing. ""Told you so,"" said Paul. He grabbed a gold bar from his pocket and smashed the Elements. Twilight frowned until then she head the sounds of galloping.  ""You think you can destroy the Elements just like that? We'll, you're wrong, because the spirits of Elements are right here!""  ""Applejack, who funded this expedition thanks to her government-subsidized apple farm, represents the spirit of... Big Government!"" A bloated, orange dollar symbol appeared on Applejack's chest.  ""Fluttershy, who forced the sovereign citizen to give up his rights, represents the spirit of... Coercion!"" A yellow gun strapped itself to Fluttershy's side.  ""Pinkie Pie, who was completely useless during this trip, represents the spirit of... Parasitism!"" A pink leech attached itself to Pinkie's chest.  ""Rarity, who beat up an innocent person just because he was rich, represents the spirit of... Class Warfare!"" A blue hammer appeared in Rarity's front right hoof, and a sickle in her front left hoof.  ""Rainbow Dash, who ran over innocent Palestinian protestors with her Bulldozer, represents the spirit of... Zionism!"" A necklace with a Red Star of David appeared and wrapped itself around Dash's  neck.  ""The spirits of these five ponies got us through every challenge your supporters threw at us!"" finished Twilight.  ""But your spark didn't summon the last Element,"" exclaimed Ron Paul,"" Also, unbound delegates.""  ""But it did! A different kind of spark. I felt it the very moment I realized that I loved oppressing the rich. The spark ignited inside of me, when I realized we could work together to oppress more people! You see Nightmare Moon, when those Elements are ignited by the spark of altruism that resides in the hear of us all, it creates the sixth element... The Element of Cooperation!"" monologued Twilight. A tiara with a purple gem landed on Twilight's head. She and her friends rose up. Her eyes glowed with an authoritarian light and a rainbow beam flew out.  ""DELEGATES, TO ME!"" said Ron Paul. And then the delegates appeared and absorbed the rainbow beam.  Ron Paul whipped out his copy of the constitution and said, ""BY THE POWER OF THE CONSTITUTION, I VETO YOUR EXISTENCE.""  And then he killed Twilight and her friends. The electoral college than overrode the majority's rule and elected Ron Paul as President. The moment he entered the Oval Office, all of Equestria was bathed in Freedom™ and then nothing bad ever happened again.  The end.",™

t5_2qj8u,spinnelein,1360020204,"Here's the CDA article from our newsletter this month:  STYLE OF THE MONTH: CASCADIAN DARK ALE  Cascadian Dark Ale (aka India Dark Ale) IBUs 60-90+  Color: 40+ SRM OG: 1.060-1.075 (15-18 P) FG: 1.008-1.016 (2-4 P) Abv 6.0-7.75%  This February is CDA month here at the OBC as we prepare and brew for the new OBC competition “The Heart of Cascadia” (which is coming up fast on April 20). This month’s meeting is at Occidental Brewing Company and will feature a presentation on the CDA style by Northwest Brewing News writer Abram Goldman-Armstrong, and our Style of the Month is Cascadian Dark Ale.  Aroma: Prominent NW hop aromas: citrus, pine, resinous, sweet malt, hints of roast, toast, chocolate malt, and/or Carafa back-up the hops. Dry hopped character is often present. No diacetyl, esters generally range from low to none. Though the resinous, piney, and citrus hop aroma generally comes from NW American hop varieties, hops of other origins may be used to achieve this character.  Appearance: Deep brown to black with ruby highlights. Head varies from white to tan/khaki, and is generally long-lasting.  Flavor: A balance between piney, citrus-like and spicy NW hop flavor, bitterness, caramel malt, and roast, chocolate, or Carafa-type malts. Roast character ranges from subtle to medium. Black malt is acceptable at low levels, but should not be astringent. Intense ashy, burnt character is not appropriate. Caramel malt is acceptable at low levels but the finish should be dry. Diacetyl should not be present. Emphasis should be on hop flavor, which when combined with roast/black malts often exhibits a minty, spicy character.  Mouthfeel: Light to medium, hop bitterness and tannins from roast malts combine to create a dry mouthfeel. Resinous character from high levels of dry hopping may create a tongue coating sensation.  Overall Impression: A highly-hopped, medium-bodied dark ale, similar in many ways to a strong version of American IPA, except that it incorporates dark malts and signature NW hop varieties, sometimes in conjunction with fruity esters. Bitterness and body is much closer to an IPA balance than a strong ale or American stout. Finish is a nuanced interplay of hop and roast bitterness to create a dry quenching impression. Alcohol can accentuate the roast character in stronger versions.  History: A style that came to prominence on the Northwest Coast of North America in the early 21st Century. Northwest hops play key flavor roles, balanced with malt, roast malts give color and flavor, but body should be reminiscent of an IPA, not heavy like a porter or stout. The style celebrates the hops of Cascadia, the Pacific Northwest, but is commonly brewed in other regions.   Comments: Some brewers prefer to cold steep the dark grains to achieve a very dark beer without the tannin contribution of adding the grains to the mash. The use of Sinnamar to enhance color is common. The interaction of dark, roasted malts and grains with NW hop character creates a unique spicy flavor component described as minty, or rosemary like.  Ingredients: Pale or pilsner malt, some mid-range caramel malt in a supporting role, Carafa type malts, both regular and debittered, small amounts of chocolate malt, roast barley, and black patent malts can also be used. Northwest American hop varieties, or hops with similar characteristics (eg New Zealand), for flavor and aroma additions. Heavy dry-hopping is common.  Classic Examples: Phllips Black Toque, Rogue Brewer, Hopworks Secession CDA, Widmer W’10 Pitch Black IPA, Barley Brown's Turmoil, Lucky Lab Black Sheep, Three Creeks 8 Second IBA, Block 15 Benton Brigade, Stone 11th Anniversary (Sublimely Self-Righteous) Ale, Walking Man Big Black Homo, Rogue Black Brutal, Laughing Dog Dogzilla, Southern Tier Iniquity  Here’s a sample recipe to get you started From byo.com:  Widmer W-10 Pitch Black IPA clone  (5 gallons/19 L, all-grain) OG = 1.064  FG = 1.014 IBU = 65   SRM = 30  ABV = 6.5%  Ingredients  10.5 lbs. (4.8 kg) 2-row pale malt  1.5 lbs. (0.68 kg) caramel malt (10 °L)   12 oz. (0.34 kg) Weyermann dehusked Carafa® II malt (450 °L)   10 oz. (0.28 kg) Briess special roast malt (50 °L)    12.8 AAU Warrior hops (75 mins) (0.8 oz./23 g of 16% alpha acid)  1.4 AAU Cascade hops (2 mins) (0.25 oz /7.1 g of 5.8% alpha acid)  12 AAU Warrior hops (2 mins) (0.75 oz /21 g of 16 % alpha acid)   0.25 oz. (7.1 g) Warrior hops (dry hops)  0.50 oz. (14 g) Cascade hops (dry hops)   ½ tsp. yeast nutrient (15 mins)  ½ tsp. Irish moss (30 mins)  White Labs WLP001 (California Ale), Wyeast 1056 (American Ale) or  Fermentis US-05 yeast    0.75 cup (150 g) corn sugar (for priming)  Step by Step  This is a single step infusion mash using 10.5 lbs. (4.8 kg) of 2-row pale malt to replace the liquid malt extract in the first recipe. Mix the crushed grains with 4.0 gallons (16 L) of 161 °F (72 °C) water to stabilize at 150 °F (66 °C) for 60 minutes. Sparge slowly with 170 °F (77 °C) water. Collect approximately 6.5 gallons (25 L) of wort runoff to boil for 75 minutes. The 75-minute Warrior hop addition is reduced to 0.8 oz. (23 g) (12.8 AAU) to allow for the higher utilization factor of a full-wort boil. The remainder of this recipe and procedures are the same as the extract with grains recipe.",®

If one of our sales guys said that, we've ""have a sit down meeting with them to discuss their future with the company""  lol.  [Regarding Sonya and her product -  if you can test results that* far exceed* the government levels that qualify the product as *""purified water""*](http://www.thewaterlady.com/Test_Results_X6RW.html) then you've got something that can only be exceeded by lab grade (ion hungry) molecular water.  Home filtration units can't touch this by a long shot.  Furthermore, The water coming out of her system could be used for lab work, if it wasn't for her adding mineral ions *back into the water* for taste and so that it is drinkable. ( pure water is iron *hungry* and pulls them of the mouth of the person drinking it - affecting taste and what I can only refer to as a feeling alike a burn or irritation - so it has to be Ph balanced with irons )   Current test results are posted on the walls at the fill stations   Hope that answers the question.

It uses it's money for various neutral things all the time. Libraries celebrating Halloween, saint Patricks day, local festivals, movie days, or anything else. And no one sane actually has a problem with this, since in reality they like that the public facilities they are forced to pay for will give them back some things they find thematically pleasing. Can they not celebrate anything, or is it only official religious™ things you decide cannot be allowed?

Only Adblock Plus with Element Hiding Helper really helps.   &gt; What you are doing here is, you're trying to hoodwink absolutely as many people as possible into giving up personally identifiable information that they have already told you they DO NOT WANT to give up. And in doing so you are endangering the safety of children on the Internet, you are endangering the personal safety of inexperienced political dissidents, and you are doing this knowing full well that all the data you collect is within the absolute easy reach of a government that has a proven track record of extreme abuses both in terms of personal data and unconscionable and unconstitutional surveillance of its and other countries' citizens, and that's not even the worst of it, because that same track record of the last few years proves that there are absolutely NO limits in terms of what those powers that be WILL do to human beings if they so decide. You are intentially helping this in a way that can help enable even torture and murder, by intentionally working to deanonymise the Internet, and by intentionally trying to bring about a new status quo where anonymity is no longer the norm on the Internet. I put it to you that with actions like these, you are part of a concerted effort to deanonymise the Internet. Neither liberty itself nor any child's or other human being's life deserves to be sacrificed on the altar of advertiser interests, overzealous media companies' special interests or government surveillance for whatever reason.  &gt; Keep this up, and sooner or later you *will* have blood on your hands, and that is no hyperbole, and no exaggeration. Because keep this up, and sooner or later somebody will have fucked and killed a kid whose real name was on YouTube, or some government will have identified and targeted someone it considers undesirable, or some greedy company in the name of setting an example will have ruined some family's life by saddling them with grossly dispropotionate, lifelong debt, which incidentally is something that can lead to suicide.  &gt; Democracy itself is based on the principle that it is the people who are acting fundamentally in good faith and that it is the rulers and powers-that-be which need to be kept in check, because the danger emanating from abuses of power by the latter is far greater. Once you fundamentally assume the reverse, once you assume that the people are the problem and predominantly acting in bad faith, and assume that the rulers act in good faith and can be trusted *more* than the people, once you do that, you have abandoned democratic principles and embraced the *raison d'être* and narrative of justification of totalitarian rule and regimes.

t5_2qlqh,TheCodexx,1360064343,"I just think this is a gimmicky solution. Well, disclaimers first. I'm pretty knowledgeable about photography and computers. The inner-workings of cameras, digital or analog SLRs? Not so much.  But adding more sensors isn't as good of a solution as adding *better* sensors. It's like solving the problem of tires popping by putting two redundant tires on each wheel of a car instead of just improving the tires in the first place to reduce failure rates. More isn't better. We've learned this with CPUs, too! Four cores at 2 Ghz is *not* the same as a CPU running at 8 Ghz. The performance doesn't scale like that. And given the concern for ""size"", I imagine adding four sensors to a phone is a quick way to promise ""30 megapixel"" cameras and *still* end up with shitty 10 megapixel images.  But my concern is also the branding. I don't even like ""megapixel"" as a term. First and foremost, resolution should not be measured in the millions of dots. Nobody buys printer paper rated at 28,050 dots. Or, sorry, 28 Kilodots. Well, at 300 DPI, that's how many potential points of ink are going to be printable. No, you measure in size. 8.5 x 11 inches. So why are we measuring photographs in a totally different way from our computer monitors?  But if we're using that, then the next format is Gigapixel. Which is totally a thing. A Gigapixel image is pretty amazing. You can zoom in on an area and see what amounts to a whole extra image when you get into that range. It's pretty neat. But it's a whole magnitude ahead. We're talking billions of pixels in each image. Ultrapixel is something that is, somehow, even *more* misleading than ""megapixel"" is, because it's not actually a thing that denotes any sort of size, let alone quality. Perhaps it would be tolerable had they called it ""UltraPixel™ Technology"". Still misleading, but at least you're not replacing the thing consumers look for when comparing cameras with something that looks and sounds better but actually *isn't*. At least, not the way you'd think.  I'd need to see a genuine comparison, but I really think I'd prefer higher-quality sensors to more cheap ones.",™

t5_2qm4e,Foxonthestorms,1360082972,"In my work I use stem cells from mice and humans to form vasculature simply from Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) and basic Fibroblast Growth Factor (bFGF) induction (plus Serum with a proprietary blend of BMPs, TGFs, etc. We do this with ""embryoid bodies"" of ~1200 cells. They do some very funny things because they're ""told"" to differentiate in an artificial way. After just 7-8 days (for mice, humans are trickier) of differentiation there are many pockets of cells in these small lumps that begin beating in coordination. We did some RT-PCR and demonstrated that an upgregulation of *GATA4* and *Nkx2.5* occured in embryoid bodies with beating primordia. These are markers for cardiac precursors in the mesoderm.  I know this doesn't answer the question but I figured it would be cool to tell a little bit of evidence-based information.  Edit, Going into Conjecture Mode™: beating is an intrinsic capacity of every [cardiomyocyte](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardiocyte). I'm not sure if there is one *true* initial heartbeat. Cardiomyocytes link together using ""Gap Junctions"" which literally link an entire contiguous myocaridum's cytosol (This link is called an electrochemical [syncytium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syncytium)). This synchronizes local cardiomyocytes' sodium-calcium exchange which is key to a periodic contraction. There probably isnt a first true heartbeat, but as the cells progressively link together through Gap Junctions the beating becomes more coordinated as [Cardiac Pacemaker cells](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_pacemaker) proliferate and migrate to their final positions. The fetus' initial heartrate is upwards of 180. To me this indicates that there is a lot of noise and not a lot of pacemaker signal (pacemaker cells proliferate/emerge later than myocardiocytes) so with a faster electric impulse rate there is a greater chance for cells to be jolted out of an independent/arrhythmic contraction period and brought into a strictly governed contraction rate.",™

The words read  'Puts on clothes. Irons them' he dismissed it as nonsense. As he continued his lonely walk, he came upon another poster with the same enraged wolf. This one read  'Stops at green lights. Floors it on red'  Nervously,  Wolfie picked his way through the alley, taking care not to tread on the debris. As he came to the end of the alley, he saw the poster again. This time it read  'Plays Russian Roulette, With 6 Rounds in the cylinder'  A cry tore from his lips as the wolf began to lung from the paper. Looking back, he realized that all the posters were coming to life. He turned to run, but they were upon him in an instant. As the ghostly canines entered his body, he felt a strange power, as if he had ascended to become a God. The people called him insane? Very well.  He would show them true insanity.

t5_2qxih,gn_cool,1360086730,"[Imgur Article Images](http://imgur.com/a/LqYzD)  **Game Update 1.7 Developer Blog: Galactic Reputation**  Game Update 1.7 will introduce Galactic Reputation to all players. This is a new way for your character to advance in Star Wars™: The Old Republic™. In a time of widespread conflict and political strife, disparate organizations throughout the galaxy seek allies in the struggle for peace... or conquest. Reputation measures how your character is perceived by these organizations it reflects the prestige you've earned through your heroic contributions to each cause.   The Reputation track for each organization is divided into six ranks - Outsider, Newcomer, Friend, Hero, Champion, and Legend. You will start with no rank at all, but as you earn Reputation Points, your rank will increase. When you've earned the top rank in a particular organization (i.e. Legend), you will no longer earn Reputation Points with that particular organization. You will have become a living legend among those represented by that organization; an avatar of their cause.   As your Reputation Rank increases, new rewards will become available to you. Throughout the galaxy, you will find Reputation Vendors associated with each organization. Special rewards with Reputation Rank requirements can be purchased from these vendors. Items and equipment with a Reputation Rank requirement can only be purchased, used, or equipped if you meet or exceed the rank requirement.  **Legacy Titles**  When you achieve specific Reputation Ranks, you will earn a new type of reward called a Legacy Title. Legacy Titles are a new kind of title that is displayed beneath your character's name, in place of your Legacy surname title (e.g. ""The Skywalker Legacy""). For example, by achieving Friend rank with The Voss, you will unlock the Legacy Title, “Honored Voss-Friend.” Unlockable Legacy Titles are displayed in the Galactic Reputation tab of your Legacy window.  **A Legacy of Heroism**  A key feature of Galactic Reputation is the fact that it is bound to your Legacy instead of your character. In Star Wars: The Old Republic, the consequences of your character's actions can span generations, and heroism is hereditary. This means that all Reputation Points and ranks that you earn are shared across your entire Legacy, and all characters in your Legacy contribute Reputation Points to the same shared pool. Once you've unlocked rewards or titles, all characters in your Legacy will have access to them.  **Reputation and the Galactic War**  Certain organizations represent one side of a two-sided conflict in the Galactic War. For example, the ""Republic Hyperspace Armada"" represents the Republic's war effort in space, whereas the ""Imperial First Mobile Fleet"" represents the Imperial opposition in the same conflict. The Reputation track for these two conflicts is shared, even though the Republic and the Empire have competing goals. A Republic character advancing his rank with the “Republic Hyperspace Armada” indirectly advances the rank of Imperial characters in his Legacy with the “Imperial First Mobile Fleet.”  Your Reputation Rank measures the impact that characters in your Legacy have had on the conflict - even if they were on the opposite side of the war. You will never lose Reputation Points by aiding one side of the conflict - you will only increase the notoriety and political significance of your Legacy in the conflicts to come.   **Earning Reputation Points**  Reputation is earned by collecting a new kind of item called a Reputation Trophy. Reputation Trophies are consumable items that grant a small, medium, or large amount of Reputation Points when consumed. The amount of points granted by a Reputation Trophy is indicated by the quality of the item - Premium (small), Prototype (medium), or Artifact (large). Every Reputation Trophy is tied to a specific organization. For example, to increase your standing with The Voss, you can collect Gormak Power Cells, which are rewards for completing Heroic Missions on Voss.  The amount of Reputation Points you can earn with each organization is limited by a weekly cap which provides a natural endpoint for your Reputation Trophy collection each week. You can still acquire Reputation Trophies after you hit your weekly cap, but you will not be able to consume additional Reputation Trophies for points until your cap is reset. If consuming a Reputation Trophy would put you over your weekly cap, you will still be granted the full amount of points from that Reputation Trophy. Weekly caps are specific to each organization, so even if you hit your weekly cap with one organization, you can continue earning points with others.  Subscriber Bonus You can earn additional Reputation Points each time you consume a Reputation Trophy if you have a Reputation Bonus in effect. All Subscribers get a natural +50% bonus to all Reputation Points earned. This value is displayed in the Galactic Reputation tab of the Legacy window.  **Reputations in Game Update 1.7**  Game Update 1.7 will launch with four organizations represented in the Galactic Reputation system:  | Organization   | How to Earn Reputation | |:-----------|:------------| | The Voss   | [WEEKLY] Defending Voss-Ka ||Voss Heroic Missions | | The Gree Enclave | ""Relics of the Gree"" Event Missions || ""Relics of the Gree"" Event Bosses | | Republic Hyperspace Armada	| Hard Mode Space Missions | | Republic Fifth Assault Battalion	| [WEEKLY] Section X Crisis ||Section X Missions | | Imperial First Mobile Fleet	| Hard Mode Space Missions | | Imperial Guard on Belsavis	| [WEEKLY] Section X Crisis || Section X Missions |  And that’s our new Reputation System in a nutshell. Players can look forward to us adding more Reputation organizations in the future that will include new and familiar locations!  Jesse Sky Lead Flashpoints and Operations Designer ",™

t5_2qh1e,AnxiousReginald,1360103345,"I don't know what's going on here, but some of that stuff you just linked is demonstrably false. Seriously, crack open the OED and see for yourself. Also, I don't see anywhere where it supports your proposition.   &gt; Although there is an entry for the “reduction by 10 percent” meaning in the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), it contains no example sentences, which is unusual.  The OED I'm looking at (Oxford English Dictionary Second Edition on CD-ROM (v. 4.0) © Oxford University Press 2009) actually contains three relevant definitions:   * ""1. To exact a tenth or a tithe from; to tax to the amount of one-tenth. *Obs*.""  * ""3. *Milit*. To select by lot and put to death one in every ten of (a body of soldiers guilty of mutiny or other crime): a practice in the ancient Roman army, sometimes followed in later times.""  * ""4. *transf*. a. To kill, destroy, or remove one in every ten of. b. *rhetorically or loosely*. To destroy or remove a large proportion of; to subject to severe loss, slaughter, or mortality.""  I'm assuming by ""reduction by 10 percent"" the author of the article is referring to definition 4.a. Under 4. the following example sentences are offered:  * ""1663 J. Spencer *Prodigies* (1665) 385 The‥Lord‥sometimes decimates a multitude of offenders, and discovers in the personal sufferings of a few what all deserve.  1812 W. Taylor in *Monthly Rev.* LXXIX. 181 An expurgatory index, pointing out the papers which it would be fatiguing to peruse, and thus decimating the contents into legibility.  1848 C. Brontë *Let. in* Mrs. Gaskell *Life* 276 Typhus fever decimated the school periodically.  1875 Lyell *Princ. Geol.* II. iii. xlii. 466 The whole animal Creation has been decimated again and again.  1877 Field *Killarney to Golden Horn* 340 This conscription weighs very heavily on the Mussulmen‥who are thus decimated from year to year.  1883 L. Oliphant *Haifa* (1887) 76 Cholera‥was then decimating the country.""  As you can see, the first example sentence listed, from J. Spencer, can refer only to the 4.a. definition of the word, as ""personal sufferings of a few"" can't really be construed to refer to the personal sufferings of ""a large portion."" Thus, there is indeed an example sentence listed under the ""reduction by 10 percent"" meaning.   Further, both definitions 1. and 3. mean a reduction in 10 percent, albeit in specific contexts. In any case one could not say that the word ""decimate"" was always used to mean ""a large loss."" ",©

Bite Beauty Luminous Lip Library: Glad I bought it. The lipsticks are creamy and well pigmented, and especially with the included primer they stay put longer than other brands I've tried. Definitely plan to purchase individual tubes of my favorite shades.  bareMinerals The Star Treatment™ Set: A lot less impressed by this palette than I thought I'd be. Better for applying a wash of color over the whole lid as they apply pretty sheer and don't coordinate with each other so well. The included mini shadow primer was also nothing special.   Tarte Gifted Amazonian Clay Smart Mascara: Makes my lashes look AMAZING! Find it smudged from time to time but I've never had a mascara that didn't smudge on me, and it never flakes or leaves my lashes feeling stiff or clumped together. Overall I'm really happy with it and it's definitely the best mascara I've tried so far.

t5_2qore,justagirl90210,1360133789,"Wrong. This game is fundamentally broken for several reasons:  * The game's engine is optimized more poorly than some COLLEGE PROJECTS I've seen. This game is so simplistic, and yet it runs like DOGSHIT on high end computers. Because of the way they did the asset loading, the game is basically unplayable on mechanical hard drives if you have any standards (you don't). A SIMPLE game with blurry ass low resolution textures and low poly models brings fucking 680GTX cards and Ivy Bridge CPUs to their knees. What a joke. I can't have fun with games that run like complete stuttery shit.  * The game becomes unplayable after a while when you realize that you're going to be spending significant amounts of time SKIPPING obnoxious dialog boxes that you never want to see again. How fucking STUPID is Blizzard? They design an item hunt game where people just want to farm, and then they FLOOD it with fucking obnoxious dialog boxes that can't just be turned off? What the FUCK is going on over there? The dialog boxes shouldn't even pop up past normal difficulty. NOBODY CARES.  * The game doesn't have working hit boxes. The animations on characters/enemies and the actual collisions DO NOT SYNCHRONIZE. It's fundamentally shitty gameplay for this reason. You can't even CLICK on shit accurately because the hitboxes are so completely fucked up.  * The whole game was designed around the RMAH. You can't make a FUN item collection game because of the RMAH. They have to make good items almost impossibly rare. It's the ONLY way to guarantee that people will BEND OVER FOR BLIZZARD™ and use the RMAH. Items are always going to predominately suck because of this.  * The game has a shocking lack of content given its 7 year development time. Really, the actual campaign is painfully short, and there's a disturbing lack of variety in the environments and background art. What the fuck? Some of the textures in act 3 are so simplistic and blurry, it feels like a budget game at times--not a game that was in development for 7 god-fucking years.   If you look at Diablo 3, it really doesn't have a lot going for it. It has simplistic graphics, it runs like shit, it has BORING forgettable music unlike the previous games, and so the one area for it to shine should have been the quantity and quality of CONTENT, but it HAS NOTHING.

t5_2qn5f,branewalker,1360137123,"Correct.  If you want your spell to **resolve before they declare attackers,** you must **play your spell before they declare attackers.**   If you want your spell to **resolve after they declare attackers,** you must **play your spell after they declare attackers.**  The tricky part is, if your opponent just turns his guys sideways, he has used a [shortcut](http://www.yawgatog.com/resources/magic-rules/#shortcut) to advance the game from the main phase to the declare attackers step, completely bypassing the [Beginning of Combat Step](http://www.yawgatog.com/resources/magic-rules/#R507) wherein you get your last chance to cast spells or activate abilities before attackers are declared (and therefore before attack triggers like Hellrider's or Primeval Titan's are put on the stack).  If your opponent does this, you are allowed to interrupt the shortcut. A quick aside on that, from the Magic Tournament Rules:  &gt; **4.2 Tournament Shortcuts**  &gt;A tournament shortcut is an action taken by players to skip parts of the technical play sequence without explicitly announcing them. Tournament shortcuts are essential for the smooth play of a game, as they allow players to play in a clear fashion without getting bogged down in the minutia of the rules. Most tournament shortcuts involve skipping one or more priority passes to the mutual understanding of all players; if a player wishes to  demonstrate or use a new tournament shortcut entailing any number of priority passes, he or she must be clear where the game state will end up as part of the request.   &gt; A player may interrupt a tournament shortcut by explaining how he or she is deviating from it or at which point in the middle he or she wishes to take an action. A player may interrupt their own shortcut in this manner. A player is not allowed to use a previously undeclared tournament shortcut, or to modify an in-use tournament shortcut without announcing the modification, in order to create ambiguity in the game.  A simple ""combat?"" or ""entering combat""  (from the attacking player) will suffice to give the defending player an opportunity to cast his/her spells and allow the attacking player to avoid giving away information about attackers.  *The More You Know*  ♒♒♒♒♒♒♒♒♒★",♒

t5_2rdg1,Windyo,1360175636,"**EDIT : this was originally going to be a one-line comment... Sorry for the wall of text. There is no TL;DR, please read or ignore.**  I just did this, went a total WoT bender.  I read the fourteen tomes in 3 months, poring over the pages 4 hours a day at minimum.  It ruined WoT for me.  Wot was always my favourite series ; I started reading it in 1998, when I was 8 years old. Being relatively young, I of course sided with Rand, Matt and Perrin in tEotW, and loved the series as a whole afterwards. Every time I bought a new tome, I would re-read the whole series before reading it ; I wasn't such a voracious reader then, so this took me almost a year every time. What's important here is that though I've read the tomes a LOT of times, I had never done a full run, and as such I still found everything great.  And then, I decided to go back and do a final PowerRead™ to finish the series in glorious detail.  I'll be honest, at first it brought me to a new level of enjoyment and comprehension of the work. Details I had missed stood out, character development becomes obvious, especially in the later tomes when they flesh out and become less predictable ; I felt immersed in the world and loved it. I'll be honest, even KoD and CoT were enjoyable : when you just read them as part of a whole 11 916-page epic, they actually become two center tomes in the series. In those two tomes, Jordan stopped for a bit, developed all the characters, put some backstory in there ; it makes the world more real, more tangible. (Had he done so from the start and spread out in all the books rather than just in those two ones, it would have been even better, but still.)  And then comes Sanderson. Honestly, apart from him ruining Mat in his first tome, I think he did a really good job. He took of right off the bat, and finished a series that could have died with its author. He did the best that anyone could have done.  But doing a full re-read and changing from Jordan to Sanderson is like going from a beautiful scenic route to the same route, but unpaved. You stall, it feels rocky and unnatural, the whole world seems to fade out. Sanderson's style is WAY more dynamic, which most people liked, and more action-centered. Reading through the books normally, I thought it brought a bit of fresh air to the series and went along happily. Doing the PowerRead™, for me it was like the world had the plug pulled on it. the characters went back from being fleshed out to two-dimensional, and everything that seemed to progress logically according to the rules of the world suddenly became confusing and obscure. And it continues on through the last books. AMOL first read : YAY ! PowerRead™ : ... I'm not reading this ever again.  This is NOT a critique of Sanderson's work. He did everything he could, he read the series a LOT, he respected Jordan's universe in ways most people couldn't or wouldn't have. I think he's a good writer, and I like his stories.  But re-reading the whole series in one great go just makes all the small changes, all the ridiculous little things, every single blade of non-existing grass stand out. And though I think no one could have done better, it still wasn't enough for me.   P.S : If you're reading this for some reason, Sanderson, thank you. Despite what I just wrote, I respect the work you did greatly, and without you the series would never have been finished.",™

t5_2s46m,Papander,1360186122,"This just makes me cringe :D  From what I understood you first shave with the electric razor. Then to get a closer shave you use the shick razor. But you are not applying any shaving cream? And your aftershave routine consists only of showering.  If I did that to my face, it would be super irritated. But I do have a sensitive skin. I have written this [pretty long post](http://www.reddit.com/r/wicked_edge/comments/179jhs/cant_shave_everyday_need_some_advice_from_other/c83h4ym) about skin care and shaving.  You should first take a shower to soften the beard. If you don't want to take a shower, then apply a warm wet towel on your face and keep it there 2-3 minutes. You want to hydrate the beard, which makes it easier to cut the hair. Beard is said to be as tough as copper wire of the same diameter when not hydrated.  Wash your face with a high-glycerin soap (e.g., Musgo Real Glyce Lime Oil soap (MR GLO), $6.50/bar, or Whole Foods 365 brand glycerin soap, $2/bar, or Dr. Bronner's bar soap, or Clearly Natural glycerin soap), using your hands, rinsing partially with a splash. [Leisureguy™.](http://www.reddit.com/r/wicked_edge/comments/15eqbh/my_so_got_me_a_starter_kit/c7lz76u)  Washing your face with facial cleanser is another option, which works for me.  Use traditional shaving cream/soap combined with a shaving brush to create the shaving lather.  Shave first with the grain. Once done rinse with warm water, re-apply the lather with the shaving brush. For the second pass shave across the grain and rinse with warm water. To get even closer shave, re-apply the lather and shave against the grain as your thirds pass. But in the beginning when you are still practicing, leaving it to just 2 passes and skipping the against the grain is a good idea.  After you are done shaving, rinse with cold water, then apply aftershave balm to soothe the skin. Let it dry and finish by using a moisturizer with SPF. Or if the balm is moisturizing enough you can just use separate sunscreen.  The scent from the soap/cream doesn't really linger after the shave.  -----------------------  Check out [**Mantic59**](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2DB6D82F52BA7608) he has very good educational videos in youtube about wet shaving. There is also [**a book**](http://www.amazon.com/Leisureguys-Guide-Gourmet-Shaving-Enjoyable/dp/1477436804/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1357766113&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=leisureguy) written by Leisureguy, it is available for kindle as well.   Here is my kit suggestion. All quality products. You don't have to *upgrade* this stuff.  * **Razor:** Edwin Jagger DE8x. There are 3 different versions: DE86(Ebony), DE87(Ivory), DE89(Chrome). The razors head is the same in all these models, just the handle is different. So pick the one you like the best. $35. Another alternative is the [Muhle R89](http://connaughtshaving.com/mur89.html), it uses the same razor head as the Edwin Jagger DE8x. You can get it shipped to US for $36 (normal price seems to be $60). * **Brush:** Many options here. A good Omega/Semogue boar brush $10-25. Silvertip badger brush from [whippeddog.com](http://whippeddog.com/) $26. [Synthetic brush](http://connaughtshaving.com/hjmsynthetic.html), cheapest handle type costs $25 which includes shipping to US. Any of these options would serve you well. * **Shaving cream/soap:** Shaving cream is usually recommended for beginners, as it is easier to create the lather with cream, than it is with soap. Some good cream brands: Taylor of Old Bond Street, La Toja, Speick, Razorock, Cella, Geo F. Trumper, etc. $6-20. * **Razor blade sampler:** [Read this article about blades by Leisureguy](http://leisureguy.wordpress.com/2007/08/07/a-disquisition-on-blade-sampler-packs/). $8-30. * **Aftershave:** Nivea sensitive aftershave balm, can be found from your local supermarket. Good and inexpensive. Doesn't really have a scent. * **Bowl:** For bowl lathering you can use any small sized bowl you have in your house. Or you can purchase one from your local supermarket for really cheap. [A typical rice bowl](http://newenglandadventures.edublogs.org/files/2012/04/RiceBowl-11d9cgt.jpeg) would suffice.  Total: You should be able to put a kit together using the products I listed for about $85.  [**List of some of the online shaving stores**](http://www.reddit.com/r/wicked_edge/comments/177jf4/where_can_i_get_a_decent_razor_sample_pack_uk/c82xhgr).  And some additional information below about shaving:   * [Read this beginners guide to boar brushes.](http://www.bruceonshaving.com/2010/10/10/a-beginners-guide-to-boar-brushes/) * [Watch this Mantic59 youtube video on how to build lather.](http://youtu.be/Dd7Aj9vwrtc) * [Watch this Mantic59 youtube video on how to clean and care for your brush.](http://youtu.be/7dRVZz83ago) * [Geofatboy has some good youtube videos as well.](http://youtu.be/HiXojYrLhVA)   ------------------------------------  Note: The Edwin Jagger DE8x is a 3-piece razor. Thus it is possible to install the baseplate incorrectly when you are putting the blade in.

t5_2qh11,Abeneezer,1360189569,"Okay this is the last time I'm trying to get through to you. To some extend i agree with you about doctors of specific fields holding dubious beliefs, which then might turn out false. These top scientists might be able to convince other people with lesser education in or knowledge of the specific subject, which will virtually be everybody, that they are correct.  But you know what? That doesn't matter! Because some day the theory might be falsified, provided there is proof and everybody will move on.  Enough meta science for today.  Back to the subject. Let me put it nice and easy. I first looked at the [wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_tolerance). The major point here: &gt;Consumption-induced tolerance  &gt;Alcohol tolerance is increased by regular drinking. This reduced sensitivity requires that higher quantities of alcohol be consumed in order to achieve the same effects as before tolerance was established. Alcohol tolerance may lead to (or be a sign of) alcohol dependency.  So, being the observant and scientific reader I am, I went to the references and found the [number [1] article](http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/aa28.htm). Again here is the major point in this:  &gt;Alcohol and Tolerance  &gt;Alcohol consumption interferes with many bodily functions and affects behavior. However, after chronic alcohol consumption, the drinker often develops tolerance to at least some of alcohol's effects. Tolerance means that after continued drinking, consumption of a constant amount of alcohol produces a lesser effect or increasing amounts of alcohol are necessary to produce the same effect. Despite this uncomplicated definition, scientists distinguish between several types of tolerance that are produced by different mechanisms.  And now, your problem seems to be that there has *never*, according to you, been *any* scientific research in this field, living up to your (somewhat unelaborated non-default) standards. Well fuck that, seriously! Take a look at the references in the [number [1] article](http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/aa28.htm). You see those 30 references *I already told you about earlier*? Those 30 references I kindly told you to gnaw through? [Here thay are](http://i.imgur.com/CqsY4F3.png) plain and simple. [Just to take 1 example](http://trid.trb.org/view.aspx?id=370280) (and I obviously can't show a full scientific paper due to © and such). These guys have ""experimental evidence of reporting effects of alcohol tolerance on the signs of drunkenness as well as on the performance of psychomotor tasks"". Stop being so ignorant.

No single group controls the world these days, but there's a relatively small number of influential social and business circles that have a collectively huge influence on How Things Are Done™.  And the influence pops up in oddly unexpected ways. E.G., the Royal Patron of the Rhodes Scholarship people happens to be the current Queen of Saudi Arabia.

t5_2qj8f,tune4jack,1360206933,"Your friend has a horrifying misunderstanding of how blood donations work. If we only gave blood right when a friend or family member needed it, everyone who would require blood would be dead.  Blood can't get automatically sent to the hospital while the patient waits in the ER bleeding to death. First you need to wait for a blood clinic to open, then you need to prove who you are and get your hemoglobin tested, then you need to fill out a questionnaire, then you need to get your temperature and blood pressure taken, then you have to answer more questions form the nurse, then after you give your blood it has to be tested for diseases, **then** it can be given to people who need it (I know you already know all this, but I'm just trying to point out how wrong your friend is). There's no such thing as Blood2Go®.  I don't know where you live, but here in Canada you need to wait 56 days between donations. This fact alone should be enough to dissuade anyone from taking your friend's advice. Certain medical procedures require multiple units (bags) of blood. Look how much is needed for leukemia and auto accidents! http://www.blood.ca/CentreApps/Internet/UW_V502_MainEngine.nsf/page/E_Who%20Needs%20Blood A continuous supply of blood from donors is needed.

t5_2w92e,make_it_reign,1360224487,"Over the years I’ve gotten a ton of “Please make another MMORPG!” (sometimes accompanied by “A good one this time!!!!”) or “Please make a DAoC 2” requests as well as lots of other interesting requests that seem quite anatomically impossible. However, after the “challenging” years of 2005-2009, I needed time, circumstances and stars to align before I was ready to make the decision to jump back into the MMORPG pool. When Mythic Entertainment set out on Dark Age of Camelot just about everybody in the industry said we would fail. That leading our little team against such major companies as Sony, Microsoft and Electronic Arts, who had their own (or were backing) MMORPGs, was nothing short of insanity. After all, even with a strong vision and a young and hungry team, we were told we had no chance of success. Well, despite the odds, only 2.5M in total development funding, 18 month cycle, and a tiny team (about a dozen full-time developers when we started), we created one of the best MMORPGs of all time, Dark Age of Camelot. As I’ve said many times elsewhere, I’m eternally grateful to that team because without their dedication, effort and creativity Dark Age would have been just another idea I got while taking a shower. However, in the immortal words of the great philosopher Timon, “You’ve got to put your past behind you.” :)  That being said, I needed another great idea before I was willing to even consider making another MMORPG. While I’ve covered some of the steps I’ve taken down the MMORPG path elsewhere, it’s worth talking about this core concept a bit more. There was/is no greater champion for using these European myths and legends than me. I still love them as much as I did back in 1999 when I had to convince the Mythic team that it was the right idea for an MMORPG (and don’t get me started on how hard that was and that paled in comparison to trying to convince potential publishers and distributors). BTW, my favorite quote from those years is still how one European executive for a rather major multi-media company said to me “I don’t know why you think European players would be interested in playing a game based on Camelot.” Now, how could we use some of the same public domain myths and legends in a different and unique way? Well, quite a while ago a friend of mine and I were discussing what kind of games could succeed in Asia. He gave me some tips and I filed those away for future use. Many months later I remembered one of those tips, the one that had been especially important to me throughout my career, use dragons! One of my first online games was, of course, Dragon’s Gate and I still wear the same dragon charm that I have worn for over 20 years. Putting dragons into a game is hardly new. However, what if our world’s dragons were a mere reflection of what these beings are in their own reality? In addition, what if in their dimension their technology is what we call magic? Then, what if a cataclysmic event pierced the walls (Veil) and the power from that dimension flooded our world – a world with no magic, wizards, and dragons? Moreover, what if that power brought these legends and stories, dreams and nightmares, to life all at once? How would the world be changed? Would it even survive? This shattered world is the backdrop for what comes next.  This is my vision for a new IP based on some of the greatest tales the Western world has ever known. A world where Arthur and his knights are not mere legends, but are alive and fighting to build Camelot; where Nuada has gathered the newly emergent Tuatha Dé Danann as they take their first steps out of the ether and where Sigurd is leading his mighty Viking warriors into glorious battle. This is not my former concept re-skinned, not simply Dark Age of Camelot 2 with a new name. If you are looking for a bold new vision for these legends, just as Dark Age of Camelot was a new vision back in 1999, look no further. If the idea of a Tri-Realm™, RvR-focused game where there is no PvE grinding, no gear grinding, no “instanced-based PvP/RvR” but with a entirely player-owned and crafted economy and where your choices matter, all set within a truly open and persistent world appeals to you, then I hope I’ve piqued your curiosity. And most importantly, if the words “server pride” and “realm pride” hold a special place in your heart; then I welcome you to my vision, our world and one day, with your help, a place where you are not merely reliving the legends of Camelot, Vikings and the Tuatha Dé Danann but forging them yourselves.  -Mark  P.S. I still hate gold farmers, paid power-levelers and hacked clients. I may have mellowed a bit but I haven’t changed THAT MUCH! :)  Also, if you are interested in seeing this vision come to life, please sign up for our newsletter! We’re trying to use it to both gauge initial interest in the game but also to communicate with our future players so pretty please with a Viking on top?",™

t5_2qpp6,FlukyS,1360227889,"My predictions and ill add observations underneath so the ✔ and ✘ say if I got it right or not and ill update my predictions for different results.   **DRG** &gt; Bomber ✔  Got to say the first game was pretty lucky to do damage with the run by but it just goes to show how powerful that kind of thing is. The game was over when he did that. The second game forgetting baneling speed I thought was a game ending mistake but the huge 3 sided attack was great and killing that many marines and that many SCVs with the initial counter put DRG in the position where he could tech fast and just end the game easily with ultra. DRG played pretty much standard DRG, huge mechanics and his patented style of ZvT with ling bling muta.  Innovation &lt; **Taeja** ✘  Game 1 I very surprised Taeja just didn't die mid game. The amount of sensor towers made me laugh a bit. Innovation made a few mistakes I have to say. The run by into the main. The huge drop and the accidental sacking of 3 tanks was really sloppy. The nuke fake to get the tanks to unsiege was really smart from innovation. I got to say it was the relentless aggression that innovation did eventually worked but I think Taeja did really really well to stay in it.  Interesting both players are going marine tank medivac in both games rather than mech. I know its stylistic but its interesting the trend. The two in both games so far have been very equally matched.  The SCV pull from Innovation was excellent to break Taeja's position in the middle of the map to bring him just outside Taeja's natural. Taeja's economic lead was what carried him to the win even with innovation almost taking it with the contain and with his great control.   Game 3, taeja opened up a proxy barracks with a tech lab that did no damage but he didn't commit so he was fine. Both players going mech but taeja mixes in a good bit of bio. Innovation does a bit of damage with a hellion run by. Both players have the exact same opener pretty much getting the raven and viking to stop banshee harass which is very smart. Innovation hits with a 2 base timing with air dominance with a good bit of vikings. Taeja was spread quite a bit because he had the third. Innovation gets up the ramp and takes down the 3rd cc. It was pure positioning and the strength of that timing that got him the win.   Innovation was hugely aggressive in the series and im surprised how well it worked since Taeja played so well in each of the games.   The map choices are something of note: Daybreak, innovation was hugely aggressive and it worked eventually, the drop play was really good on the map so it helped him quite a bit.  Whirlwind was a very smart pick for taeja because of how hard it is to attack on that map. Its big and a macro map so Taeja wanted late game. Since innovation was so aggressive first game this was so smart.  Innovation picked Cloud kingdom which is a smaller map so it fits his more aggressive style.  ~~**DRG** &gt; Taeja~~  **DRG** &gt; Innovation ✘  Some things of note: If innovation plays aggressive against DRG he definitely won't do well. DRG's mid game is very unit heavy he maxes out fast he has lots of ling bling. Id presume innovation will definitely proxy rax at least one of the games because of lack of practice in TvZ if he focused like he should have on TvT when preparing for today.   DRG hatch first into gas into pool without scouting which is interesting because in the first games against bomber he scouted on 13 in both games. Innovation opens CC first. DRG opens early speed and innovation opens reactor hellion. Innovation only has 1 gas so its definitely not going to be hellion banshee. He is doing hellions to be safe and get fast stim. Innovation is doing a great job dealing with DRG's creep spread.  I have to say the attention to detail from innovation is really impressive. He kept his hellions alive for a very long time. He played entirely safe and didn't allow those really annoying run bys and he really pressured DRG without committing to stop the creep and in turn denying DRG that powerful map control that creep gives Zerg.  Innovation sieging up the 4th which on cloud kingdom is a pretty common problem for Zergs on that map. DRG lost the base for nothing and was hugely behind. The teching to ultra worked so well but it just wasn't enough because of his poor economy and how cost effective the marine tank was. I think cloud kingdom was a great map for innonvation but at least DRG doesn't have to play on it again which is good. I think innovation really had DRG's number this first game, I think maybe if DRG had like 4 or 5 roach to push back the hellions so he could get his creep spread going because a lot of what killed DRG was the lack of map control.   Game 2, innovation opened the same except with double gas this time and went hellion and cloakless banshee but had stim too which is a difference to the usual terran opener which doesn't include the early stim. DRG opened how he usually does, 1/1 upgrades ling bling muta.  Tastosis mentioned the vikings and I have to say as a Zerg player, sniping the overlords that are spread annoys me so much.  Innovation was quite wasteful with drops and DRG did a nice timing on the third and did huge damage. DRG's focusing of tanks with the muta and the ling bling hitting marines is just so cost effective. DRG handled the transition to broodlords pretty weak and lost a few drones and 4 infestors for nothing to drops and the timing on DRG's 4th caused so much problems for him. Marine tank just was way too cost effective. Innovation played pretty perfect although the Zerg player in me says wow how did DRG lose from that position.   ~~**Innovation** &gt; Bomber~~  **Taeja** &gt; Bomber ✔  Have to run for an errand so wont get to see this but ill check the result.  ~~**Innovation** &gt; Taeja~~  **DRG** &gt; Taeja",✔

t5_2qnc9,MeditationMcGyver,1360242114,"Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) and Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) use a common set of exercises to reduce distress in chronic pain and decrease risk of depression relapse. These standardized mindfulness (ST-Mindfulness) practices predominantly require attending to breath and body sensations. Here, we offer a novel view of ST-Mindfulness’s somatic focus as a form of training for optimizing attentional modulation of 7-14 Hz alpha rhythms that play a key role in filtering inputs to primary sensory neocortex and organizing the flow of sensory information. In support of the framework, we describe our previous finding (Kerr et al, 2011) that ST-Mindfulness enhanced attentional regulation of alpha in primary somatosensory cortex (SI). The framework allows us to make several predictions. In chronic pain, we predict somatic attention in ST-Mindfulness “de-biases” alpha in SI, freeing up pain-focused attentional resources. In depression relapse, we predict ST-Mindfulness’s somatic attention competes with internally focused rumination, as internally focused cognitive processes (e.g., working and short term memory) rely on alpha filtering of sensory input. Our computational model (Jones et al, 2009) predicts ST-Mindfulness enhances top-down modulation of alpha by facilitating precise alterations in timing and efficacy of SI thalamocortical inputs. We conclude by considering how the proposed framework aligns with Buddhist teachings that mindfulness starts with “mindfulness of the body.” Translating this theory into neurophysiology, we hypothesize that with its somatic focus, mindfulness’ top-down alpha rhythm modulation in SI enhances gain control which, in turn, sensitizes practitioners to better detect and regulate when the mind wanders from its somatic focus. This enhanced regulation of somatic mind-wandering may be an early stage of mindfulness training, leading to cognitive regulation and metacognition.  Catherine E. Kerr1*, Matthew D.

t5_2qnc9,MeditationMcGyver,1360244850,"Peter Malinowski School of Natural Sciences and Psychology, Liverpool John Moores University, Liverpool, UK  The scientific interest in meditation and mindfulness practice has recently seen an unprecedented surge. After an initial phase of presenting beneficial effects of mindfulness practice in various domains, research is now seeking to unravel the underlying psychological and neurophysiological mechanisms. Advances in understanding these processes are required for improving and fine-tuning mindfulness-based interventions that target specific conditions such as eating disorders or attention deficit hyperactivity disorders. This review presents a theoretical framework that emphasizes the central role of attentional control mechanisms in the development of mindfulness skills. It discusses the phenomenological level of experience during meditation, the different attentional functions that are involved, and relates these to the brain networks that subserve these functions. On the basis of currently available empirical evidence specific processes as to how attention exerts its positive influence are considered and it is concluded that meditation practice appears to positively impact attentional functions by improving resource allocation processes. As a result, attentional resources are allocated more fully during early processing phases which subsequently enhance further processing. Neural changes resulting from a pure form of mindfulness practice that is central to most mindfulness programs are considered from the perspective that they constitute a useful reference point for future research. Furthermore, possible interrelations between the improvement of attentional control and emotion regulation skills are discussed.

EVE Fanfest is the annual festival that features over 1,000 EVE pilots, DUST 514 mercs and their friends and family from around the globe coming together in Reykjavik, Iceland for three straight days of constant celebration. This year will be the biggest, most amazing Fanfest yet, taking place less than a month before EVE Online’s tenth anniversary on May 6th and celebrated by the most unique and imaginative community in all of gaming.   As of this announcement, tickets for the event are nearly sold out, a truly blistering pace as the “Early Bird” package just ended with several of the extra events already at capacity.   “Fanfest is the truest celebration of the EVE universe, where online foes become instant friends and shared war stories over drinks bring our wonderful community even closer together,” said Hilmar Veigar Petursson, CEO of CCP. “This year, as DUST 514’s journey truly begins and we celebrate ten glorious years of EVE Online with our fans, CCP will be going bigger and bolder than ever before by creating a truly amazing Fanfest for those attending or following along.”   This year even more unique events will supplement the amazing panels, presentations, PvP tournaments, exotic local excursions, game demos, round tables, first-looks, developer pub crawls, concerts, parties and more.   Icelandic Symphony Orchestra The night before the official opening of Fanfest, the Icelandic Symphony Orchestra will perform selected music from the original EVE Online soundtrack in an inspired and artistic performance that will set the mood for the events to come. Tickets and more information are available at http://midi.is/concerts/15/387/   Make EVE Real The new “Make EVE Real” speaker track will include luminary speakers and scientific pioneers who will share bold initiatives for humanity and its place among the stars, exploring areas where the tech and science behind EVE’s future universe could become a modern reality. The first announced speaker, Michael Laine (President of LiftPort Group) will present a vision for the future of space exploration via a “space elevator” following over a decade of research with a world-class team of experts and a recently successful Kickstarter campaign to conduct an experiment and to engage the global community. More speakers actively involved in advancing towards what we now consider science-fiction will be announced in the coming weeks.   Mixed Martial Arts Icelandic Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) phenom Gunnar “Gunni” Nelson (10-0-1) will take part in a completely unique spectacle at Fanfest—bringing the fight to the ground like the DUST 514 mercenaries of the EVE Universe. Nelson recently signed a sponsorship with CCP for DUST 514 and will be attending Fanfest fresh off a Feb 16 UFC match in London’s legendary Wembley Arena.   Even more announcements about the massive EVE Universe Second Decade celebration will be revealed in the coming weeks, from musical acts to in-depth programming leading up to the famous Party at the Top of the World.   Tickets for EVE Fanfest and more information about the event can be found at: http://fanfest.eveonline.com The Fanfest 2013 promotional trailer can be found here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AuQnCfVq1M For Fanfest support or specific inquiries, please contact fanfestsupport@eveonline.com For more information about CCP, EVE Online, DUST 514 and other general inquiries, please contact nedcoker@ccpgames.com",®

(All the others amounted to Bandaid™ fixes, touching just the surface of the core of the problem).  The problem of USA gun violence has roots.  This is visible on the surface in the politics, manifestly visible here on reddit in the affinity of GOP/Libertarian/Rural/TeaParty politics with their gun culture dogma.  The only true cure possible is to marginalize the roots.  Fortunately, this is [already happening.](http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/18/in-gun-ownership-statistics-partisan-divide-is-sharp/)    By the end of the second Hillary term, the demographic Urban/Hispanic/youth wave will have marginalized this minority 'pro-gun' faction to the point that solid Australian style gun control policy will be possible.

You may notice when talking to Redditors that some of them are here. Ron Paul, particularly his first run in '08, was very popular on this site.  I am not one of those people, but I've noticed that the more libertarian minded folks use the same type of anti-establishment rhetoric that you might assosiate with the 60's counter-cultural movement.  Libertarians and Progressives seem to dislike certain elements of our economic policy. Both are clamoring for change. Both can claim an edgy, revolutionary style. But they couldn't be more different.

t5_2qh0u,criticital,1360264697,"holliepocketreddit slowly rouses, once again, from a jagged night's sleep.  Her awakening is not a smooth, gradual transition, but one more like a cranky and dilapidated elevator lift that has lasted long past it’s usefulness; one that unreliably chugs, slowly, unevenly, to the next floor; sometimes with a gasp, sometimes with a lurch, but never with a guarantee of arriving at the intended destination.  The late afternoon light harshly scalds her blood-lined eyes as they unevenly splinter open, blinking, trying to deflect the sun's rays.  She eventually builds tolerance to the glare and pushes her legs off the side of the bed.  Gravity takes over from there and her feet drop swiftly towards the ground.  As she pulls her body up, CHEETOS® crumbs fall from her chest and into her lap while her throaty groan reaches full crescendo.  Her arms hang limply at her sides, palms up, on the bed next to each of her legs.  Here, she must pause.  Here, she must resist the overwhelming urge to sink back into the crumbly, orange dusted sheets.    Her head turns to the bedside table on her right and an orange nugget falls from it's embedded post on her cheek.  There she spots her stained, chipped, avocado colored coffee cup.  Pfaltzgraff.  Stoneware.  The only remaining piece left from the set of dinnerware her family used while she was growing up.  She fucking hates that cup.  The heaviness, the grating feeling on her fingernails if she should accidentally scrape the surface.  She shudders at the thought and turns her head towards the door of the bedroom.  She looks beyond the door and into the hall which leads to the kitchen...to the coffee pot, where remnants of day old coffee may likely remain.  She calculates the distance, the likelihood that there will be more than a half a cup of coffee, the effort required to make a fresh pot.   She looks again to the coffee cup.  This cup had been in her family for years.  Not an heirloom.  Not a cherished family memento.  Just a utilitarian object.  It serves a purpose.  Invisible.  Unrewarded.  It has survived where others have not.  A thought begins to scratch at her brain, reminding her of the similarity to herself, but she violently shoves this thought away.  ""Fuck it"", she says out loud as she snatches the Jack in the Box® cup instead.  The cup is only 1/4 full of light amber liquid.  She sucks on the straw, and it is only somewhat productive as there is a crack halfway up.  Eventually, lukewarm, watered down Diet Coke® splashes on the back of her dusty throat, taking her by surprise.  She coughs and sputters,""Godamnitmotherfuckinghorseshit!"" And so, the day begins.  She hauls her body upright and tiny orange pebble-sized objects ping off the floor with a tiny bounce.  holliepocketreddit slowly shuffles across the room, slurping the flat, watery Diet Coke® in one long slug until it is gone.  She instantly regrets it, as she now must deal with the stale, flat aftertaste in her mouth.  She needs a chaser.  She spots a lone CHEETOS® on the floor.  With only a slight hesitation, she bends over and scoops it into her mouth.  Still crisp, still tasty.  Breakfast done.  She falls into her chair at the computer, while a whoosh exhales from the vinyl cushions.  The monitor is still lit up from the previous night's patrol.  Multiple tabs open.  Reddit.  Pics.  Puppy wolf.  It's starting to come back to her.  Her orange stained fingers begin to tremble.  Her heart begins to pump faster and faster until she can feel the blood vessels in her brain begin to throb.  Her chest begins to heave more and more aggressively until she is panting.  Her mouth clenches tightly.  So tight that she begins to feel a pain in her jaw.  There is blood...slowly beginning to seep from the corner of her mouth.  Her lip begins to curl on the upper right side exposing some of her teeth.  It is true, what hamsterpotpies says is fucking TRUE!  The light from the monitor casts it's bluish tone across holliepocketreddit's face, reflecting in her depraved eyes.  She is beyond herself with inexplicable rage.  Uncontrollable, inexplicable RAAAAGE!  She is near seizure.  Body spasms in waves.  Then, suddenly it stops.  She is still.  She inhales deeply then lets out one long, forceful sigh.  holliepocketreddit places her fingers on the worn keyboard.  Some of the keys are so worn that no letters remain.  This is of no concern.  She knows the keyboard by heart.  She gazes at hamsterpotpies' posted reply and she starts to tremble again.  Rage begins to spill, but she quickly gets it under control, for there is work to do.  She clicks ""Reply"".  She types, ""It gets the wolf title every time too, even though it's not a fucking wolf.""  She hits ""Save"".  ""Save"", she repeats to herself.  ""That's exactly what I'm going to do.  Save the world from these fucking reposts.""  She leans forward in her chair, elbows on her desk, and rests her chin on her folded hands.  She gazes at the image of a puppy sitting in the sand, eyes closed against a brisk wind.  She sits unaffected by the blunt, pudgy, furry snout.  The floppy ears likely bouncing in the wind.  The imagined puppy breath and sharp tiny teeth.  The imagined squeaky puppy whimpers and yelps.  She remains...unaffected.  Her flatness is chilling.  A thought forms in her mind.  Thoughts of action.  She decides that she will send a message to hamsterpotpies and to all the other three-word monikered redditors. They will correct the wrongs.  The reposts...will...die.     ",®

It's not linked to in the [original blog post](http://blog.krisk.org/2013/02/packets-of-death.html) or the [Intel Packet of Death](http://www.kriskinc.com/intel-pod) page. As a matter of **FACT**, Intel doesn't provide *firmware* for these NICs, primarily because they ***DON'T RUN ANY FIRMWARE!*** The EEPROM is a whopping *128/256 BYTES* in size, and only contains what is called the BCT (Basic Configuration **Table**).  Going to the [Intel Download Center](http://downloadcenter.intel.com/SearchResult.aspx?lang=eng) and searching for ""82574L"" and ""firmware"" yields only ***TWO*** results:  *IBABuild utility for BIOS developers to create an Intel Boot Agent image for inclusion in a BIOS supporting Intel® Ethernet LAN silicon.*  and...  *Utility for BIOS developers to create an iSCSI boot image for inclusion in a BIOS supporting Intel LAN controllers*  Not even close.  You seem to have a problem with a) reading comprehension and b) lack of understanding of computer architecture at this level.  &gt; what do you mean it isn't a firmware bug?  I mean just that. There is no *firmware* bug, because there is ***NO FIRMWARE***.  The EEPROM images Intel supplies are *base set* (default) configurations to aid developers and integrators in seeing their product to market. They are meant to be tweeked to each particular case, ie: unique MAC address, default power management settings,PCIe bus timing, etc.  So where is the 'update' Intel released?

But it clearly is made entirely of lego, with a steel and wood structure.    The interior designer's site says:    http://i-beamdesign.com/projects/residential/residential.html    &gt; The stair railing is made of nearly 20,000 LEGO® blocks.     Looking at the pictures, I'd estimate that there are 50% 2x6, 20% 2x4, 20% 2x8, and 10% 2x2. Pricing that at Lego store retail prices comes to:    10,000 2x6 @ .30 = $3000 4,000 2x4 @ .30 = $1200 4,000 2x8 @ .40 = $1600 2,000 2x2 @ .20 = $400     Grand total: $6,200  Now there are certainly cheaper ways to buy the bricks. And Sean Kenney is a ""Licensed Lego Artist"" and probably gets really good promotional consideration for his work from Lego since this is such good PR.

HOLY SHIT.   The guy begs for an O-Line in every press conference and they still won't let him run a single sweep or pitch all year, not to mention just putting whoever they can get out there at G. Throw a check-down once in a while. How about a screen? Nope. Power, Dive, 3rd and 8 Jake Locker has 2 seconds to make a (bad) decision because the House is coming.   I have a .... I HAD a deep seeded Hatred for the Rams because of what happened in the Super Bowl, but to be honest, I had more fun watching Rams games last year then I did Titans games. That is the worst thing I have ver typed, but it's true.  The Rams are the Titans of 1999-2005. All they are missing is Steve McNair running out of bounds after getting a first down and high fiving the side judge (TN fans will be able to picture this perfectly because the guy made a career doing it). I am seriously wondering if all this time I was just a Jeff Fisher fan and not a Tennessee Titan fan and it makes me feel like a 9 year old whiny child.   There's more but I'm stopping here because I am only making myself more and more angry  e|: One more thing; Our defense is a shadow of it's former self. It's embarassing knowing we have to put up 30 to win a game because The Old Fart™ bud Adams thinks he's drafting for a BASKETBALL team and not the NFL. It's disgusting.  e2|: Sorry for all the 'Ours' and 'We's' I know thats frowned upon here but I was typing in a stream of consciousness and it's easier that way; deal With It :D  ",™

t5_2ql8s,super_luminal,1360283007,"Got another reply back from another friend that had 2 surgeries very close together because her skin could not accommodate the size she wanted all at once:  ""I honestly took more time off after this second surgery than I did my first, which I think has been really helpful in terms of ensuring that the quality and integrity of the surgery is the best it can be. I'm sure if you asked a bunch of girls this question, you would likely get many different opinions and responses...and it IS different for everyone. BUT, in my personal experience, I did not lose that much muscle at all. I was able to get back into light cardio within two weeks, so I still stayed active, just not to the level or intensity I was used to. That can be hard to accept when you're used to pushing yourself....but I think the rest is actually beneficial for your body. I think the MOST important thing to be mindful of during this recovery time, is diet. My surgery was scheduled right before going into the holidays....so I was fully prepared to rest and EAT. Now, I gotta admit, I went WAY overboard with my eating...and it's the one thing I wish I had been more disciplined about. I know that if I had just kept up with a healthy, consistent meal plan....I wouldn't have gained much weight at all. But, life happens. And there were some other personal events that triggered some not so healthy eating issues for me....THUS, I gained about 15 pounds. 😞   Boo. But, all that aside.....I think the best thing your friend can do is just rest, recover, and eat clean. It's inevitable that some strength will be lost during this process, but it comes back pretty quick. The reality is that she just put her body through a pretty traumatic (and expensive) procedure....so she HAS to be patient, and remember that it's SO much better to take the time off and heal properly, than risk potential problems by coming back too soon. She sounds like a strong girl, so she'll bounce back. I hope that helps a little! I'm happy to answer any other questions....just let me know.""",😞

Intel was made aware of this issue in September 2012 by the blog’s author.  Intel worked with the author as well as the original motherboard manufacturer to investigate and determine root cause. Intel root caused the issue to the specific vendor’s mother board design where an incorrect EEPROM image was programmed during manufacturing.  We communicated the findings and recommended corrections to the motherboard manufacturer.  It is Intel’s belief that this is an implementation issue isolated to a specific manufacturer, not a design problem with the Intel 82574L Gigabit Ethernet controller.  Intel has not observed this issue with any implementations which follow Intel’s published design guidelines.  Intel recommends contacting your motherboard manufacturer if you have continued concerns or questions whether your products are impacted.",®

Except the errors show ""polosims"" which is a deleted domain (polosims.com) but it turns out they had a [weird website which was online in 2005](http://www.screenshots.com/polosims.com/).

While no obvious content is on helcorp, there is a link on nanohive to his [""Personnel File""](http://www.helcorp.com/bhelfrich/) hosted on helcorp.  BUT. It was safe to say he was somewhat more famous, having a wikipedia mention for some work on the [NanoHive@Home](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nano-Hive@Home) project, something to do with the simulation tests on nanohive-1.org I guess.

t5_2r2jt,arbuthnot-lane,1360292784,"&gt; it was touted as this amazing vaccine that should be required for everyone even before there were long term Stage IV trials on efficacy.  This is hardly relevant today.   &gt; On top of that, consider the giant price tag for a vaccine that you have to get every 5 years.  The cost is insignificant compared to the costs of HPV-related disease. Direct costs associated with the prevention and treatment of HPV-related disease are at least 4 billion$ per year, and indirect costs such as productivity losses add 1.3 billion$ per year, in the U.S. alone.  This is of course in addition to the massive human cost and suffering.    Globally, cervical cancer is the second most common cancer among women and is thought to be the largest single cause of years of life lost to cancer in low-income countries.    Approximately 490,000 women are diagnosed and 270,000 die from cervical cancer each year.    In the U.S., despite organized cervical cancer prevention programs involving regular Pap screening in reproductive-age women, approximately 11,000 women are still diagnosed with cervical cancer and 4,000 women die from the disease annually.  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2925431/#R63  The argument against pharmaceutical companies making money makes sense from certain political points of view, but since nationalizing the pharma industry in the U.S. doesn't seem realistic in the near future, it is a moot point.  &gt;a vaccine that you have to get every 5 years.  That is not actually the proposed plan. We do not know for certain yet, but having a booster every 5 years does not seem medically necessary. It might even be adequate with the initial dose. We will know more in a few years.  &gt;An additional dose of Gardasil® at year five was shown to induce a strong recall response, with titers for each type at least as high as the peak titer following the initial series of vaccinations. Thus the vaccine induces the expected B cell memory response, a property of other vaccines with durable immune responses. **Modeling exercises that assume long term memory estimate that detectable antibody levels will remain at least 12 years, and perhaps life-long in 99% of vaccinees.** Although the long term persistence of stable antibody levels is an encouraging finding, the antibody levels needed to prevent infection or disease are currently unknown. Thus, it remains uncertain whether the vaccines will confer life-long protection or whether an additional booster(s) will be needed.   http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2631230/",®

t5_2ryd5,bluepepper,1360317295,"1  Some complex things were built, but it doesn't follow that all complex things were built.  A lot of people see a builder in the complexity of life, but that tells us more about people's need for intent than about the actual existence of a builder.   This question also raises the problem of: who built the builder.  2  The story of the exodus is remarkably absent from Egyptian and other records.  No trace of the four centuries sojourn in Egypt, the escape of well over a million Israelites from the Delta, or the three months journey through the wilderness to Sinai.  We can seriously doubt it actually happened.  About the creation of Israel: it was created partly to fulfill the prophecy, so it's hardly a surprise.  It wasn't really created in a day.  There's just a day when it became an independent nation, as is the case with most nations.  3  If there's an absolute standard of morality, why does God change his mind?  Why is it okay to drown the whole world, then not okay anymore?  And if this absolute morality is written in my heart, why do I find some of God's actions throughout the Bible utterly despicable?  4  If you're sincerely searching for truth (not Truth™) you can read the bible but you should question every claim it makes, including Jesus' birth, words, actions, death and resurrection.",™

t5_2rzjk,ewiethoff,1360321737,"*Ark* by Stephen Baxter depicts realistic interstellar travel and search for Earth-like planets. No aliens.  *Manifold: Space* and *Manifold: Time* by Stephen Baxter are mind-blowing speculation, although *Time* doesn't have aliens.  Mars trilogy by Kim Stanley Robinson is realistic depiction of terraforming and settling Mars, also some of the rest of the Solar system. No interstellar travel or aliens, though.  Edit also...  *Cities in Flight* collection by James Blish. Entire cities traveling through interstellar space in search of Earth-like planets, but not as corny as it might seem.  *The Time Ships* by Stephen Baxter. Because it's an official sequel to H.G. Wells' *The Time Machine*, the time travel machine is silly. But the novel has a lot of mind-blowing speculation.  *Starfarers* by Poul Anderson depicts distant future, realistic interstellar travel,  and aliens. I haven't tried his *Tau Zero*, but *Starfarers* has good characterization.  *The Forever War* by Joe Haldeman has time dilation interstellar travel. But it's a space marine™ story, so it lacks the sensawunda which I think you're looking for.  *Contact* by Carl Sagan. With vastly superior aliens. The vastly superior aspects are mysterious, but the science is realistic otherwise.  *2001* series by Arthur C. Clarke. The vastly superior aliens and their tech are inscrutable, but the SF is realistic otherwise. (Well, okay, HAL is not realistic in the year 2001.)  *Eon* and *Eternity* by Greg Bear go the distant future, have fascinating aliens, and are fairly realistic. I wish these were the ""sequels"" to Arthur C. Clarke's *Rendezvous with Rama*. ",™

In Botswana, heavy metal music has landed. Metal groups are now performing in nightclubs, concerts, festivals. The ranks of their fans have expanded dramatically. These fans wear black leather pants and jackets, studded belts, boots and cowboy hats. On their t-shirts stand out skulls, obscenities, historical covers of hard-rock groups popular in the seventies and eighties, such as Iron Maiden, Metallica, and AC/DC. They have created their own style, inspired by classic metal symbolism, but also borrowing heavily from the iconography of western films and the traditional rural world of Botswana. Their nicknames, Gunsmoke, Rockfather, Carrott Warmachine, Hellrider, Hardcore, Dignified Queen, may appear subversive and disturbing as their clothing, but they are peaceful and gentle. ""We like to get dressed,, drink meet friends and feel free , this music is so powerful . We are lucky to live in a country tolerant and open"" argues one of the leaders.

t5_2qh13,NSojac,1360351215,"Plenty of people give a shit about them. Again, they've won numerous awards, most of them **specifically for their coverage of drone strikes**. They meticulously document their claims, as you would know if you had ever visited their site. For inquiring minds, you can find the data [here](http://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/category/projects/drone-data/).   Here's an example of how thorough they are: &gt;Ob307 – January 6 2013 &gt;♦ 8-18 reported killed &gt;♦ 3-7 reported injured &gt;The CIA continued its New Year offensive with the third strike in five days – possibly the bloodiest attack in 88 days (Ob297). Between 8 and 18 people were reported killed when as many as five US drones fired a barrage of missiles in a pre-dawn strike (2.30am). The unmanned aircraft battered the Babar Ghar area of South Waziristan according to several reports. The target was reportedly an alleged militant training camp run by Hakimullah Mehsud, leader of the Pakistani Taliban (TTP). One of the commanders present was reportedly a cousin of the TTP leader. Pakistani intelligence officials told Associated Press he was Wali Muhammad Mahsud (aka Toofan); Dawn reported he died in the attack. They alleged he was responsible for training TTP suicide bombers. Others killed were reported to be ‘Punjabi Taliban’. Two or three locations were reportedly targeted in the strike – the buildings were said to have caught fire leaving bodies burnt beyond recognition. NBC News cautioned that the death toll could rise as ‘dozens’ of alleged militants were at the scene at the time of the strike. Civilians who rushed to the site to search for survivors reported several drones remained over the area after the strike.  &gt;This was the second drone strike in three days that reportedly targeted TTP militants. On January 3 an alleged TTP commander was killed. These strikes followed the January 2 killing of powerful militant leader Maulvi Nazir. His group had been labelled ‘good Taliban’ as they focused their operations on Nato and Afghan targets in Afghanistan. The TTP – so-called ‘bad Taliban’ – reportedly focus attacks on the Pakistani government and military. Associated Press reported that this latest strike ‘may be less likely to anger the Pakistani military and public’ than the killing of Nazir ‘because it targeted militants believed to have been going after targets in Pakistan and not in neighbouring Afghanistan.’ Cricketer turned presidential-hopeful Imran Khan condemned the strike. He said the government had turned Pakistan into a banana republic and called on Islamabad to ‘take the nation into confidence about the details and identify those killed in drone attack’.  &gt;The TTP attacked a Pakistani Army outpost on February 2. As many as 35 people died in the attack: 13 soldiers, 12 militants and at least 10 civilians, including three children. The TTP contested the death toll, saying only four suicide bombers took part in the attack although an ensuing fire-fight reportedly lasted for up to four hours. A Taliban spokesman said the Pakistani state was supporting the US drone strikes. He said the attack was in retaliation for the drone strikes that killed Wali Muhammad Mahsud and Faisal Khan (Ob306). The circumstances of the civilian deaths were unclear. Reports conflicted over whether a suicide bomber destroyed a civilian home or if the house was hit by Pakistani rocket fire.  &gt;Location: Babar Ghar, South Waziristan &gt;Reference: Associated Press, AFP, The News Tribe, Express Tribune, KUNA, Xinhua, Voice  of America, PTI, NBC News, Times of India, RFE/RL, Zee News, Pakistan Today, Reuters, NBC News, BBC, Dawn, Dawn, CNN, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf Press Release, Reuters, New York Times, BBC, AFP, al Jazeera, LA Times  They do this for every drone strike.

Depth of field is an aspect of gameplay, as it affects player vision. We are reviewing the gameplay impact, and may add the option to tune it.  **BeakieHelmet - Why is brightness and contrast disabled at the moment, and when can we expect to see those sliders enabled?**  A: There is a CryEngine bug associate with this feature, expect to see it fixed in the future.  **TwigTech - Are there any plans to improve or adjust the night vision in the future? Currently it's contrast is too high for me to use without hurting my eyes (especially in River City Night), so I find myself alternating between thermal and regular vision in night battles instead.**  A: I answered no in the last QNA, but this has been brought up numerous times, so maybe.  ____  **Weapon Related:**   **Tabrias07- Are you considering implementing hardpoint types i.e., Regular/Large or SRM/LRM only?**  A: Not at this moment.  **Artgathan - Is there a chance of seeing 'manufacturer-specific' weapons (meaning that weapons would have variants that are slightly different from each other, such as longer range or faster reload, for example)?**  A: Possibly, we have a design for it.  **Haas360 - Any ETA when the flamer and machine gun will have their crit system changed to be effective to armor stripped mechs?**  A: Tuning is ongoing, expect some changes in the next 2-3 patches.  **Lazyone - Is there any way we can get detailed info about weapons in the mechlab? Like how much damage it does, how much heat it builds up and range.**  A: Done.  **Iacov - When you designed the machine guns - were you aware of the purely awesome sound effect it has?**  A: Yes. Thanks to Sean.  **Nathan Foxbane - Will we see any or some of the more exotic and rarer/unusual non-experimental weapons systems in game?

Can you make it so you can? **  A: We plan to add this with UI 2.0.  **Kazly - Would you consider leaving the functionality of ECM alone and perhaps putting a small hitbox on it somehow? As in... it uses an antenna and a direct hit will take it out?**  A: We have tuned the crit HP to make it more vulnerable.  _____  **Joystick:**   **Alpha One - Will we be seeing any improved joystick support in the near feature, such as changing the turning axis to analog and a Relative / Absolute toggle for the pitch and yaw axes? Also access to joystick configuration options (axis inversion, sensitivity, etc) in the control options menu as opposed to having to manually edit the User.cfg file?**  A: Yes, no ETA.  **Anony Mouse - What news, Any news, can you convey regarding native Joystick/Controller support?**  A: Ongoing improvements will come online in the next few months.

t5_2ve1u,jookato,1360355682,"&gt; I agree that no topic is out-of-bounds in theredpill.  Do you, really?   &gt; There are ugly truths that need to be found, and that can only be done so by discarding the thin veil of political correctness.  Exactly.   &gt; Race, while somewhat genetically diverse, is for the most part superficial. There are differences, of course, some of the most obvious being skin color, bone structure, and so on. And yes, there are behavioral differences. This is to be expected when a subset of humans become isolated over enough generations.  &gt; But the differences between races is minuscule compared to the evolved differences between the genders. It's VERY important to note that a lot of racial observations are wrong. Or at least understanding the order of causal links.  You're saying that because the differences between genders had way more time to develop, they're _much_ more meaningful than the differences between races?  That sounds reasonable, but I don't think it's that simple. At the very least, that's not enough to reject any discussion on issues of race.  What if the total amount of time both kinds of differences spent developing happens to be roughly the same? What if gender differences reached the point where they are now in much less time than racial differences took to develop? How much has the way women select mates ""needed"" to evolve through the ages? Since the development of races happens in isolation, wouldn't it be much faster than that of gender differences?  It's obvious that there are differences between races, even behavioural ones, as you conceded.  Basically, my view on black people boils down to this: As a race, they're more prone to violence _overall_, less intelligent overall, and therefore _inferior_ as human beings.   Us whites, in turn, are inferior to Asians, in the exact same ways. You go to Japan, South-Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, Hong Kong, etc.. and you won't see any football hooligans, hockey fans ready to beat up anyone for liking the wrong team, weekend nights with streets full of loud stone-cold _retard_ monkeys making their monkey noises everywhere, and so on.. This shit just doesn't happen, because Asians are a less savage race than whites.  It goes without saying that I'm not claiming _every single black person_ is violent, but that the percentage of black people engaging in violent acts is large enough to constitute a noteworthy phenomenon. The _nature_ of these violent acts is probably noteworthy too.  I can't _scientifically prove_ to you that they're a more violent race, just like you can't scientifically disprove it. All we can do is observe their behaviour as a subset of People, and draw conclusions from that. Case in point: http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=wA7BbsYOkvw#t=89s .. another: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxjlk6Lv4jg .. and another: http://www.wnd.com/2013/02/black-mob-beats-man-until-skull-broke/ (notice how a woman participates too) .. there's plenty of this stuff out there. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo-crYw-Zu4 .. http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=549_1360247939  This is an interesting article too: http://www.amren.com/ar/2005/10/index.html .. I think that was one of my first wake-up calls to the reality of races.  Oh, and:  &gt;&gt; Meanwhile, the CBS affiliate is claiming that  “flash mob” violence in New York has reached “epidemic” levels. Store owners are reporting more than 50 recent attacks, where surveillance video show the perpetrators as black, but which the station reports as teenagers.  .. But you already knew that the mainstream media all over the West is sweeping black/muslim crime under the rug, right? It's always ""Youth""® raping and killing people, so that the readers/viewers just assume it was someone from the (original) ethnic majority who did it. In Sweden, they use the Swedish word for ""youth"", ""Ungdomar"". In Finland they use the equivalent Finnish word, ""Nuorukaiset"". It's all to cover up savage nigger/muslim animals' crimes.  You're American, right? Have you got any idea how fucked up Europe is by muslims and muslim-niggers? Islam is another little nugget of Reality not many people have swallowed.   Here's Islam in Sweden: http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=lbpyk1uHNWY#t=33s .. these savages are shown a ""movie"" that talks about gay bars, and they start _raging_.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=2IDBxPLp3i0#t=17s   The city of Malmö in Sweden has been completely overrun by muslims by now.  - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaDjJAK0yRo .. what kind of a fucking _ANIMAL_ robs someone and sets him on fire while at it? -Why a Nigger + Muslim -animal, of course.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyNv8kvd2H8  It's not only Sweden, by the way. Most of 1st-world Europe has a serious muslim-animal infestation.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xCdehrV96U http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6otzhKJhQjc  England, France, Germany, Belgium, Sweden, Norway, Holland, Denmark, etc..  all (being) overrun by these fucking medieval savages. Finland is on its way towards Suicide By Islam too. Luckily we're just not as far along that road as the aforementioned countries.    &gt; There is a difference between being black and black culture. The only reason we have a ""black culture"" is because the culture itself exists and comes from black people. But it is not because they are black that their culture exists.   We agree that black culture exists because it comes from black people.. So why would their characteristics as a race not be a considerable factor in what their culture is like?  What would you say ""black culture"" entails, by the way? Besides extreme machismo, rap music (mostly just more machismo) and vilifying ""acting white"" (ie. being interested in acquiring knowledge)?   &gt; Because of this, I'm going to say that we will not tolerate racism on this subreddit.  This is what I take issue with.   You know how there's this thing where someone says ""I'm not a racist, but.."", and then proceeds to say something (you consider) racist?  Well, what your post boils down to is ""I'm not against freedom of speech, _but_.."". There's no need for Thought Police on a subreddit that purports to discuss Reality. Quite the contrary, this should be a place for discussing things freely and openly.  As far as I know, before the word ""racist"" started being used as a general tool for bludgeoning people with Unharmonious views into silent submission, it meant something like hating black people purely for being black, or hating someone purely because they represent another race. Nowadays, calling someone racist amounts to little more than ""I find what you said upsetting, and want you to stop saying things!"", _precisely_ like calling us misogynists.  People hear something they find uncomfortable, and start raging and throwing labels around..  racist, misogynist, leftist, sexist, and whateverist. We're vehemently opposed to discomfort, and try to block its sources.  Instead of evaluating whether there's something to what someone said, people concentrate on _how he said it_, and on whether it violates the rules of Political Correctness, where no hypersensitive little sheep should ever be subjected to hearing something that ""offends"" him.    &gt; But talk like ""a white woman deserves what she gets if she hangs out with a black guy"" is just plainly racist. I'm happy if you say ""a girl deserves what she gets if she hangs out with ghetto folk."" There is a distinction, because there are plenty of terrible white guys, and being black does not make you part of that culture.   Most ""ghetto folk"" are black, though. But why? Is The White Man keeping them down? Or is it actually black culture, or by extension, their black nature?   &gt; I will delete blatant racism.  In other words, _you_ will decide what is ""blatant racism"", and you will then proceed to limit freedom of speech as _you_ see fit.  For what it's worth, I recently got banned from /r/niggers. They found me lacking in zeal and blindness. Here's how it started: http://www.reddit.com/r/niggers/comments/17slkq/obamas_son_tosses_9_year_old_off_the_roof_of_a_5/c88jwrc  Here's another ""conflict"" of mine: http://www.reddit.com/r/niggers/comments/17r7l8/understanding_why_nigger_music_is_so_terrible/c883lsz  Most of the people on that subreddit are just not very bright, but the links they gather are representative of the hidden reality of Niggers.

My ""late 2009"" 17in unibody MacBook Pro was about a *year old* when lion came out. I waited a few updates to install since I do *real work*™ with it just like you should with a workstation.   The apps I use had received updates, the OS had received updates. I didn't have any compatibility problems. That wasn't an issue.   It took what was essentially, a machine that was only *approaching* being two years old and was running all the apps I need awesome and made both the system in general, and those apps run like *shit*. We're talking beach balls, massive load times whenever I'm opening projects/large psd files/etc. 4gb of ram used to have me contemplating maybe upgrading eventually and only hurting with gigantic projects or hd video in premiere, and now it swaps 100% of the time doing basically anything.   It reminds me of those people who took their VW diesels in to the dealership for a service bulletin on the gauges fucking up, and revived a software update that like halved the perceived power of the engine.   I feel like I bought something, which was actually expensive as hell, and then they just completely pissed and shit all over it when it was barely old enough for the factory warranty to expire. If I had bought AppleCare it would have just expired last month.   It did everything I needed quickly with snow leopard. With the same software doing the same tasks on lion it's slow as hell. This has *barely* improved. I might try mountain lion, but I'll probably just wipe and downgrade to snow leopard again. I feel like I've given it more than enough time to Come in to its own with updates and such as well.  It seems like it wouldn't run ML/lion ok without maxing out the ram and getting an ssd, which was previously a ""maybe if I have extra money"" kind of upgrade and now also seems mandatory. ",™

[Here's Impression.AVI](http://normalpornfornormalpeople.com/index.php/videos/81-impression-avi), for example.   It begins with a black screen showing the text ""Impression.AVI"". The vid is black and white, there's a static / clicking sound. The camera pans up to a shirtless man standing in an empty room with a folding chair; he is wearing black pants and a white mask. He looks down, then to the side. He picks up the chair, folds it up, and throws it on the ground (there is no sound besides the static and clicking, though). He crosses his arms, and the camera pans back down. It pans back up, and the man is gone, but the chair is placed back in its original position. Cut to a child who looks upset, then a cut to a close up to the guys masked face. Another cut to the masked guy sitting on some stairs. A pair of thin, black legs can be seen walking across the hallway at the top of the stairs. The masked man puts his head in his hands. He rubs his mask; he looks upset. He then gets up, crosses his arms, and looks at the camera. The camera pans down the stair, then cuts to the girl again, and a child's voice is heard. Yet another cut, and we see the man's mask illuminated in darkness behind... something white? Child's babbling continues, cuts back to the girl, then one last time back to the masked man.

In 'gwiyomi player', they say 1+1 is gwiyomi, 2+2 is gwiyomi, 3+3 is gwiyomi, etc etc. So all the answers is gwiyomi(cutie), and you do aegyo for each one(usually a different kind of aegyo for each number).

t5_2qh33,Dogs_Not_Gods,1360421790,"Then that was it, I was down to my last quarter. I looked at it, and knew that I should just walk away. That sensible part of my brain that you never listen to told me to cut my losses, live to fight another day, and so on. But the other part of me, that half of your brain that's driven on pure instinct and hedonism, shouted louder. I put the coin in, grabbed the control, and aimed for the stuffed Rainbow Dash. The doll I knew would win her heart over.  It's not as if I could say that this had been the worst day ever. I knew there's worse things that could happen. I could have pee'd my pants in front of the whole class during show and tell like Ronny McGuire had done in the 3rd grade. I could have fallen in dog poop, and had to have my mom bring me new clothes in the middle of the day. That happened to Stacy White. Poor Stacy. You don't recover from that, not really. No, it started as one of those days where several little things just kept going wrong. Makes you lose perspective. Makes you do stuff you wouldn't normally do if you were in your right head.  For one thing, my Avengers underwear was still in the wash. Mom hadn't got to it last night, lazy cow. I liked that underwear. It was my favorite. Loose, gave my wee wee breathing room. Instead I had to wear these whitey tighties, with no superheroes or nothing on them. Just this scratchy red border on the seams. You're thinking ""that's not so bad"", but it gets worse. It was picture day, so I didn't even get to wear anything else that could have been comfortable. Mom was panicking over my hair for what seemed like hours, combing it back, to the side, telling me I need to use shampoo more. Finally, at breakfast, I find out all the Lucky Charms are gone. My dummy head little brother had gotten it all, chomping on it with his mouth open in noisy, sloppy squelches, milk and cereal bits running down his self satisfied chin the whole while. I could have knocked him to the ground just for that. So I eat my Frosted mini wheats, thinking that this is the worst of it, and it'll all be better from hear.  On the bus, I sit quietly, looking at the window, watching as mommies and daddies drive to work. They're dead inside too. You can tell from the eyes. The sags underneath slowly catching up with them, and no amount of Starbucks will ever make them go away. It's always the same thing, day after day, with no hope of anything new or better coming along. But for me, there was one thing that made this bus drive worth it. Stop #7, on Oakwood Street and La Platta. Suzy's street. I watched her as she got in, and took her seat. She was beautiful, too beautiful. She had her brunette hair in braided pigtails that went over her shoulder today. She was wearing a Rainbow Dash shirt, GAP jeans, and rainbow dash light up shoes. They glowed with each step as if she was walking on the sun. She took her seat, but not next to me. She sat by Johnny Adams, he coolest kid in school. His mom didn't make him dress up for picture day, he just came in whatever he wanted, and he still looked good. I couldn't compete with that. No one could, and he knew it. He reached his arm around her neck, as she told him about homework, or My Little Pony, or whatever. He wasn't even listening, but she didn't see that. I'd listen though.  School went on as it always did. Miss Mayweather came in smelling of cigarettes and cat pee, teaching us about math, history, spelling. I wasn't paying attention though. Suzy sat in front of me, about 3 rows down, and to the right. I watched as her legs swung back and forth, not quite reaching the ground. Occasionally her foot would hit the desk leg, making her shoe lights go off and causing a little ark of sparkling red lights. Picture day was at the end. I sat on the stool, and fake smiled against the blue and black background. I just wanted to get it over with. Those of us that we're done had to stand in line on the wall, waiting for the rest. I saw Suzy get up there. She smiled that gorgeous smile of hers, one tooth missing in the front, but that didn't matter to me. She got down and took her place in line, a few kids away from me. Johnny was next. He took his photo, and cut in front of the other kids to stand next to Suzy. Then I saw it. He placed his hand on her bottom, and I snapped. I ran at him, screaming like the Hulk, and smashed him. I smashed him over and over again, until Mayweather grabbed me and took me to the principals. Mom had to pick me up. She wasn't mad on the drive home though. I think she knew why I did it, and maybe a part of her understood too.  She took my little brother and I to a local pizza place to cheer me up. We each got to choose our own mini pan pizza, and it finally seemed like something was going right. About halfway through the meal, I got up to go potty. On my way to the restroom though, I saw it. The perfect gift. There was a My Little Pony Rainbow Dash™ in the claw machine, just under some no name frog plush. Under, but not unreachable. Two of the legs were sticking out, and I knew I could grab it at just the right angle. I had 5 quarters in my pocket. 5 tries. 5 attempts to get Suzy to notice me.  The first two were a bust. I didn't even get close to legs. The third quarter grabbed the frog a little, and lifted it out of the way just enough to let me get the body of the pony as well. On the fourth try, I grabbed it, and the claw lifted it out of the pile. The head got caught on another toy though, and wriggled it free. It was there, all of it, laying on the very top of the pile this time. If I got it, there was nothing that could keep it from going down the chute, to me, and into Suzy's arms. This was my last shot, which brings us back to where we were. This quarter meant the difference between a chocolate, or regular milk. With more allowance, it would add up in time, and maybe I could get some Legos or a Thor action figure. Why would I give up all that for the slim chance that a girl would fall for me, just because I gave her a stuffed animal from a claw machine. But even a slim chance is a chance, and I had to try. For Suzy. I put the quarter in the slot. My whole body was tense as I aimed the claw over just the right place, making the smallest but most important adjustments of my life to it. This was it. I pressed the button, and the claw went down.",™

t5_2qh1i,the92playboy,1360424342,"Not to rain on anyone's parade, but a 5 year old level requires books with illustrations on every page; all the ""Sideways Stories"" suggestions are too high of a level.The illustrations are vital. They allow for the reader to do a ""book walk through""- the reader will go quickly through the book, looking at only the pictures and getting a vague idea of the story. It is an important step because during the actual reading phase, when the reader struggles or misreads a word, knowing the story a bit helps them realize or correct that mistake. For example, the sentence might read ""The bear climbed the tree to get the fruit"", but the reader might say ""The bear climbed the tree to get the frog"" [young children often will read the first few letters of a word, and find a common word similar to it that they remember and use it by mistake]. Now, the sentence still makes sense, but by looking at the illustrations before, the reader knows that the story isn't about frogs, it's about fruit. So the reader says in their head, ""wait, this isn't right"" and re-reads the sentence, looking for the story to make sense in regards to the illustrations.For young readers, there is 3 parts to reading:Vision- looking at the illustrations and having continuity between what they are reading and what they have seen in the pictures.Hearing- when they read aloud or in their heads, does what they are reading sound right. Does it sound like a word they have heard before. Thinking- the young reader thinks ""does this make sense?"" (for example, ""the bear climbed the tree to get the fresh."" does not make sense and would cause the reader to pause and realize that an error was made and to start again.)I know many people might be thinking that is alot of re-reading of sentences, but reading is a skill that requires a ton of practice but with good form. Think of it like weight lifting- burning through 10,000 reps of bench press over a year with really poor form does little compared to the athlete who focuses on form every lift and only does 7000.Anyways, good luck, and I really suggest starting small.SOURCE: My 6y/o daughter is in a Reading Recovery program at her French emersion school and I have sat in on her sessions.

That same year, Bowman applied glyphosate-based herbicide to the fields in which he had planted the com-modity seeds to control weeds and to determine whether the plants would exhibit glyphosate resistance. He con-firmed that many of the plants were, indeed, resistant. In each subsequent year, from 2000 through 2007, Bowman treated his second-crop with glyphosate-based herbicide. Unlike his first-crop, Bowman saved the seed harvested from his second-crop for replanting additional second-crops in later years. He also supplemented his second-crop planting supply with periodic additional purchases of commodity seed from the grain elevator. Bowman did not attempt to hide his activities, and he candidly explained his practices with respect to his second-crop soybeans in various correspondence with Monsanto’s representatives.*  http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/images/stories/opinions-orders/10-1068.pdf  **TL:DR- he sprayed the fields to isolate only the seeds that had the technology owned by Monsanto to grow on his own without paying for or agreeing to the terms of the original sale.

Fact is, demand for our bourbon is exceeding our ability to make it, which means we’re running very low on supply. We never imagined that the entire bourbon category would explode as it has over the past few years, nor that demand for Maker’s Mark would grow even faster.  We wanted you to be the first to know that, after looking at all possible solutions, we’ve worked carefully to reduce the alcohol by volume (ABV) by just 3%. This will enable us to maintain the same taste profile and increase our limited supply so there is enough Maker’s Mark to go around, while we continue to expand the distillery and increase our production capacity.  We have both tasted it extensively, and it’s completely consistent with the taste profile our founder/dad/grandfather, Bill Samuels, Sr., created nearly 60 years ago.  We’ve also done extensive testing with Maker’s Mark drinkers, and they couldn’t tell a difference.  Nothing about how we handcraft Maker’s Mark has changed, from the use of locally sourced soft red winter wheat as the flavor grain, to aging the whisky to taste in air-dried American white oak barrels, to rotating our barrels during maturation, to hand-dipping every bottle in our signature red wax.  In other words, we’ve made sure we didn’t screw up your whisky.  By the way, if you have any comments or questions, as always, we invite you to drop us a line at rob@makersmark.com or bill@makersmark.com.  Thanks for your support.  And if you’ve got a little time on your hands, come down and see us at the distillery.

Just look at beer and spirits... the home brewers were outlawed (unlicensed) to create a HUGE market for a few ""beer families"" to create huge fortunes (a percentage of which goes into politicians pockets).  Politicians who pass laws that even forbid the transport and sale of other brewers products (budweiser vs coors ) into multiple states creating monopolies.  It wasn't until the pale ales and mass produced lagers became so pathetic that it allowed for those home brewers (made legal in the 1970's by Carter) were able to build up the craft brewing culture that it was able to carve out a bit of the market. Still that took 20 years to happen.   The idea is that legalization has to be coupled with an effort to ban all efforts and forms of advertising... coupled with laws that forbid large grows of anything except for hemp.  The small grower has to be protected, local craft cultivation has to be promoted and maintained without advertising - that is the main weapon in raking in the cash and putting others out of business.

t5_2w92e,CSE_MarkJacobs,1360439934,"Well, you would lose that bet then. :) Look, I understand your anger/bitterness (I've read most of your posts I think) regarding ToA and WAR. I totally get it but first I'll say some things about ToA and then move on to CU. Some of the things we did in ToA were dumb and I dealt with them when I found out about them (obviously, too late which was my fault since I was the CEO at the time) but much of ToA was driven by the fact that all of our metrics showed that fewer and fewer people were playing RvR on a nightly basis (less than 50%) and more and more people were asking us for additional PvE content. Now, when I made statements like ""ToA won't affect RvR"" and I was assured by the team that it wouldn't and then found out I was wrong, I blew a casket. Now, still my fault since I was CEO but it wasn't my intent to, in any way, make life harder for the RvRers at launch (and we did make a lot of corrections post launch right?) or to add things like the 24hr camp spawn (once again, I blew a casket over that). Now, I could sit here, point fingers at the guy who wrote the quest or his manager, etc. but I'd simply rather say, yes, we did some dumb things and as I've said elsewhere, I'm sorry for that and I'll take the heat for it as CEO.  Now, as to CU and crafters, I'm actually not an extreme guy in RL as you think as I tend to believe that the folks at the extreme of any belief system tend to be as you describe, close-minded. My decision not to go with PvE was not to alienate PvE players but rather, is simply an attempt to do one thing tremendously right. I love PvE but 16 years of playing/watching/developing MMOs has taught me that PvE content gets burned through quickly and leaves players asking for more, more and more. As a small team, we couldn’t hope to make enough content for today's MMORPG players to last more than a couple of months unless we made it so grindingly slow to advance through or so difficult to make it almost impossible to blow through quickly, that it would alienate the majority of the players for whom the content is intended for. The recent MMORPG releases have shown that no matter how well-funded the team is and the amount of content they create, players will burn through the PvE at light-speed. So, we either go the same path that almost everybody has since WoW was released has gone down (to highly predicable results) or we try something different. Our gameplan is to focus on RvR, housing and crafting as three distinct pillars of the game but all tied together through RvR, territorial acquisition and control, etc. Spend the resources on them that the team would have spent on PvE and create a game that has more sandbox elements that Dark Age of Camelot, Warhammer Online or any other game I’ve worked on and then let the players fight it out night after night. Additionally, because we are focusing on RvR, we can spend resources on new skills, abilities, areas without worrying about whether it screws it up for the PvE players. I won't call CU a ""sandbox MMORPG"" because I believe that would be misleading but it will have some of those kind of elements.  So, does this sound like I haven’t learned anything since ToA? ☺  I truly understand your concern, anger over ToA/WAR, but if you think that what we are pitching is a single-minded vision from a close-minded man, I’m sorry to say that you are mistaken. I have certainly made mistakes but I have tried to learn from them. Besides, if you were in our offices for any amount of time you’d learn very quickly how ideas flow through the studio and how nobody here is afraid to say to me “STFU NOOB!” ☺ I truly do hope you will consider backing our Kickstarter but if not, I do thank you for your former patronage and I hope at least you would be willing to look at our new game once it launches.

t5_2r9vp,brokor21,1360444771,"oh man why do you want o bastardise the movement of legal weed with your socialist, anti-capitalist bullcrap.   If the corporations can offer a good product in a competitive price, with higer quality control and customer support, then by all means buy the corporation's weed.   The example of tobacco in the article sure is frightening. But this doesn't mean cannabis will end up the same way. Also tobacco is harvested by a lot of independent farmers and then sold to big companies. Marlboro doesn't have its own fields to grow tobacco afaik.  Another poster offered the example of beer. You have huge companies like BUd etc, and microbrewries that offer a different, unique taste people will buy.  Why shouldn't weed be that way?  If it  becomes a legal product it has to take off, get ""away"" from the hands of the illegal farmer and into corperations. Then we will have a product that although highly homogenized has better consistent quality, and reaches a higher population. Yet we should still have small time growers who offer unique tastes for those interested.   Corporations are not the BIG Bad™. They are the driving force behind much innovation and quality of life improvements we enjoy in the modern world. Sure their only incentive is profit, but this doesn't mean the consumers don't enjoy the best kind of product.   In my area there are lots of people producing self-made vodka or such distilled drinks. Half of them go blind after a while cause they cannot distinguish between ethanol and methanol when the distilling procedure takes place, so they end up drinking shit that blinds them.  I would very much prefer to drink a drink i know is safe than a drink someone has made without any oversight or control.  Same goes for weed. Unfortunately right now as it is i only get shady weeds i have no idea how they came to be. Once and if it goes legal i would welcome the change.

t5_2w92e,CSE_MarkJacobs,1360447193,"You are welcome Desterion but thank you for your willingness to not only take the time to post here but also to listen to what I have to say without going “LALALALA” and covering your ears. I do get that reply at times along with some hate mail.   Now, as to your reply, I am glad it does boil down to a question of what to do when you don’t feel like RvR. I won’t waste your time by saying “RvR is going to so awesome, it will always be fun and you won’t want to do anything else!!!!” because that is total stuff and nonsense. It doesn’t matter if RvR is outstanding, there are times when you and other players won’t want to deal with it. Now, I could simply say “Too bad, it’s an RvR game” but that would be quite stupid and not at all indicative of the game our studio wants to create. So, let me mention a couple of things in a little more detail. I hope you understand that I don’t want to talk about everything yet. ☺  First, there is the crafting system. CU will have a very in-depth crafting system that will include everything from limited gathering (I don’t think gold should be mined from a rock sticking up in the road though) in the wild to control and ownership of mines, mills, etc. While mine ownership isn’t normally considered part of a crafting system it, I stuck it under there anyways. So, if you want to contribute by helping to mine or if you own your own mine, you’ll be able to do that. Now, if you like crafting items, the game is intended to have a totally player-owned economy with every item that a player can wear be created by crafters. Depending on our stretch goals, we would also add crafting ability to create things for player houses and structures. Like mining, you will also be able to help people craft items even if you aren’t the crafter himself.  In terms of housing, well, we plan on having a rather unique (for MMOs) housing system. I’ll say this much, it won’t be as simple as buying a house and then putting it down somewhere. Please keep in mind the basic concept of the game and that is of a world destroyed and would now be considered a fixer-upper. ☺  In terms of other options, as an RvR game with a large and open world, there will be a lot of things to do within the world that don’t involve traditional RvR. I’m not trying to be evasive but I don’t want to talk about all of it now. As you know, RvR should and could be more than running around in groups going from keep to keep. ☺  I hope this allays some of your concerns; we will be talking more about it as we move through the Kickstarter. Please know that I’m not trying to totally alienate those players who don’t want to RvR 100% of the time but rather, trying to design a game that will be RvR-focused but with a mixture of traditional and some non-traditional elements to keep our players happy. As always, if you or anyone else has any ideas to share, please feel free to do so. Believe it or not, I do pay attention. ☺  Mark  ",☺

That same year, Bowman applied glyphosate-based herbicide to the fields in which he had planted the com-modity seeds to control weeds and to determine whether the plants would exhibit glyphosate resistance. He con-firmed that many of the plants were, indeed, resistant. In each subsequent year, from 2000 through 2007, Bowman treated his second-crop with glyphosate-based herbicide. Unlike his first-crop, Bowman saved the seed harvested from his second-crop for replanting additional second-crops in later years. He also supplemented his second-crop planting supply with periodic additional purchases of commodity seed from the grain elevator. Bowman did not attempt to hide his activities, and he candidly explained his practices with respect to his second-crop soybeans in various correspondence with Monsanto’s representatives.*  http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/images/stories/opinions-orders/10-1068.pdf  **TL:DR- he sprayed the fields to isolate only the seeds that had the technology owned by Monsanto to grow on his own without paying for or agreeing to the terms of the original sale.** ",®

t5_2qhwp,Boffosaurus,1360471435,"I *hope* for a video game crash for the sole purpose of scaring away the big money, and reducing the budgets of games.  Games could do with doing more with fewer resources.  More companies could do without heads that don't even care about video games beyond the fact that they yield(ed) massive profits.  Now that those are going away, certain people who came in from various other industries (such as packaging) can go off and join in on the next big product ... like cheek fasteners or something.  The fact is, they didn't need to put all of this money into the game to make it a good game.  A lot of the money is spent frivolously, or on frivolous things in an attempt to make it an AAA Title™.  There are great indie games being made, there are still great higher budget titles being made.  There is also plenty of less risky room in between to make games that have a higher budget than your average indie game, and less than a metric fuckton of money.

t5_2qh03,Boffosaurus,1360475275,"More people liking a hobby being a good thing isn't necessarily good.  I honestly don't even give a shit if people call themselves Gamers now as it doesn't mean what it would make sense for it to mean.  I just think that there are two different groups of people who play games. Someone who likes Halo a lot is great, they play every Halo game that comes out, they tend to play games similar to Halo as they come out (CoD4 becoming popular by migration, I feel) and rate them on a scale based on Halo.  Plenty even go back and check out Marathon to see Halo's roots.  I don't expect a Halo fan to go back and play Ultima though.  That's fine as a Halo Fan, and as it goes, a Halo Fan is a Gamer, and a Halo Geek.  They aren't necessarily a Gaming Aficionado though, if they aren't that interested in how Halo fits into the rest of the medium.  That's the only real distinction I'm making.  It's less about enjoyment and more about seeking knowledge, and informative experience.  Console wars are a horrible thing too because they block experience, and people put on blinders to perfectly legitimate experiences.  It's just the willful ignorance I see that bothers me.  A teen cousin who only plays Call of Duty and Minecraft who scoffs at the idea of playing anything else.  A poster on Reddit who decries graphics and ... having to read, of all things, at the mere suggestion that a game older than 6 years old might actually have some value to it.  Even that is fine, except that it's become prevalent enough that it's shaping gaming for the worse.  As there are more people like that than people interested in the quality of gaming as a whole, we see games developed for that audience that lack the sense we'd expect if they were developed for ""us"".  It's not even spurring a variety of games, some targeted at the ""hardcore gamer"" (a horrible term that doesn't mean anything) and others at the ""Modern Gamer™"" as I put it in my initial post.  Instead, games are being made more and more for the latter group, and rarely for the former who are expected to buy it just because it's a game, and franchises traditionally geared towards the former are being changed for the worse to appeal to the latter.  It's a negative effect on the industry that some people refuse to see, even as it's causing it to crash around us, with studios and publishers going out of business left and right because it's not a self-sufficient model to target such transient customers.",™

That same year, Bowman applied glyphosate-based herbicide to the fields in which he had planted the com-modity seeds to control weeds and to determine whether the plants would exhibit glyphosate resistance. He con-firmed that many of the plants were, indeed, resistant. In each subsequent year, from 2000 through 2007, Bowman treated his second-crop with glyphosate-based herbicide. Unlike his first-crop, Bowman saved the seed harvested from his second-crop for replanting additional second-crops in later years. He also supplemented his second-crop planting supply with periodic additional purchases of commodity seed from the grain elevator. Bowman did not attempt to hide his activities, and he candidly explained his practices with respect to his second-crop soybeans in various correspondence with Monsanto’s representatives.*  http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/images/stories/opinions-orders/10-1068.pdf",®

t5_2qnv4,spicypineapple,1360501787,"DBT was originally developed as a treatment for borderline personality disorder, so I suspect that most DBT therapists are also focused on BPD clients. Don't let that throw you off, though! The majority of people in my group are BPD but, again, diagnosis is just a label and since the focus is on learning and using skills, I haven't found it to make any difference. Any processing I do is with my individual therapist; processing isn't done in group because half of the group time is spent learning the next skill. Even in my individual sessions, my therapist often talks more than I do, highlighting the skills I've used, areas where I could use skills more effectively, or sometimes simply validating my emotions. I didn't realize, before DBT, that not validating my own emotions prevented me from being able to deal with it and move on.   It may take picking up the phone and calling around, inquiring about DBT programs and therapists that willing to work with Bipolar 2 clients. I'd be very surprised if you couldn't find someone!   The link above will allow you to search for practices in WA that provide DBT therapy. I copied the resources below from that website:   •	Contact your local college or university's psychology or psychiatry department and inquire about clinicians trained in either DBT® or Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. You can also get this information from your state mental health board.  •	Visit www.nami.org (National Alliance for the Mentally Ill). Their ""Find Support"" section will put you in contact with NAMI chapters in your area.  •	Visit www.tara4bpd.org (Treatment and Research Advancements), an advocacy group for BPD family members. We also suggest that you read their ""Guidelines for Choosing a DBT® Therapist"".  •	Visit www.aabt.org (Association for the Advancement of Behavior Therapy) and search the ""Find a Therapist"" clinical directory.  •	Visit www.neabpd.org (National Education Alliance for Borderline Personality Disorder).",®

The pristine Amazon rain forest and Cerrado Savanna areas of Brazil cover 9 million square kilometers and are essential to the survival of our species.  These areas of dense, uncharted forest, wooded grasslands and gently meandering rivers are responsible for   20% of our planet's oxygen 30% of our planet's fresh water And are sources of ingredients for 25% of all the west's modern medicines.  But it's not just our own species that relies on this environment. It's also home to one of the most beautiful, iconic and graceful of the world's predators : The elusive Black Jaguar  Symbolizing the precarious future of all of the Amazon Rainforest and Cerrado Savanne..  This is the inspiring story of the Black Jaguar Foundation:  When we save the home of the endangered and symbolic jaguar, we can preserve our own future and the futures of generations to come.   HOW? The Black Jaguar Foundation and its partners are working on a 2,200 km long, 40km wide nature corridor along the Araguaia river in central Brazil.  It's potentially the biggest reforestation project in South America. and will preserve thousands of other species.  10 % ALREADY ACHIEVED Text in voice over AND text in screen  And you can ARE a vital part of this important cause.

He not only knew they were RoundupReady, he bragged about it to Monsanto.  *In 1999, Bowman also purchased commodity seed from a local grain elevator, Huey Soil Service, for a late-season planting, or “second-crop.” Because Bowman considered the second-crop to be a riskier planting, he purchased the commodity seed to avoid paying the signifi-cantly higher price for Pioneer’s Roundup Ready® seed. That same year, Bowman applied glyphosate-based herbicide to the fields in which he had planted the com-modity seeds to control weeds and to determine whether the plants would exhibit glyphosate resistance. He con-firmed that many of the plants were, indeed, resistant. In each subsequent year, from 2000 through 2007, Bowman treated his second-crop with glyphosate-based herbicide. Unlike his first-crop, Bowman saved the seed harvested from his second-crop for replanting additional second-crops in later years. He also supplemented his second-crop planting supply with periodic additional purchases of commodity seed from the grain elevator.

So get ready for something different! ®~~  You bored me by writing all of that in the first place.  &gt; ~~Here we go.~~  See above.   &gt; ~~While I'm not the knight in shining armor riding on a unicorn,~~  DELETE. I don't know of any guy who is like that. You're setting up girls to think you're an asshole for no reason. Was it supposed to be funny? Girls won't get it and will just think you're warning them about your douchebaggery.   &gt; I'm the type of guy who does DIY cards during Valentine's Day and Birthdays. ~~(they aren't lousy, I'm pretty good at art and I'm a perfectionist)~~  We'd like your homemade cards even if they *were* lousy. Besides, this is borderline judging *our* lousy attempts at homemade cards. Remember: be confident without potentially making girls insecure. The good at art/perfectionist stuff makes you sound like the annoying kid in elementary school, which you're not, so why make us think that you are?   &gt; I like to subtly notice what my **crush** likes/wants and surprise her with something special.   Crush? Makes it sound like you spend your time getting crushes on girls, instead of dating them. If this *is* the case, don't admit to it.  &gt; ~~It's really disappointing to get flowers and chocolates (or worse) all the time so I understand how you feel.~~  Again, you're trying to make yourself sound confident, but instead you end up insulting your audience. Maybe we *like* flowers and chocolate! I know I do. C'mon man.   &gt; I'm an exercise junkie who ran for the Cross Country team in high school. It was a gruelling experience, just imagine having to run for your life on the treadmill set to the highest speed while trying not to get thrown off and look stupid every week. (still haunts me to this day).  Good!  &gt; ~~Sure it was hard but no regrets, because it made me mentally tough and not slack off on my fitness and binge on fast food.~~  Implicit judging of girls who do not enjoy working out and those who like fast food from time to time. You're sounding like that annoying kid in class again.   &gt; During free time I try to squeeze time for basketball because it's honestly the most awesome sport in the world.   Good!  &gt; ~~Although I have many interests, video games apparently aren't included. I don't wanna become addicted and turn into a serial killer.~~  For the love of... Some girls like video games and manage not to turn into serial killers. How about going with something more neutral like *Never really got into video games, though!*  &gt; ~~Although I'm mostly laid-back,~~  Based on the rest of your profile you are the opposite of laid back, spending your time judging other people.   &gt; ~~I'm also known to be very spontaneous.~~  Just because you say you're spontaneous, don't mean girls will believe you. And why is that a keyword? Do you think girls search for profiles based on which guys claim to be spontaneous?? Because we don't. Because we don't believe you.   &gt; I once went running at 2am during Winter without the track suit, just the singlet and shorts lol ~~and people were staring at me.~~  Confident guys don't give a shit if people stare at them while the're working out. Otherwise that anecdote is good.  &gt; @@  Maybe it's a cultural difference? Do HK girls like it when guys have this shit in their profiles? Because that doesn't fly in the states. Apologies if it's just a cultural difference that I don't recognize.   &gt; ~~Another time I just went to the court at 1am and kept shooting three-pointer after three-pointer until I made 100. I must be crazy!! ๏̯͡๏~~  You sound like you're bragging. Except you're not doing it very well. DELETE.   **Final thoughts** I realize that everything above is a pretty brutal takedown. Please know that it's a critique about how you seem in your profile, not of what kind of person you are in real life.    I've done a LOT of profile critiques recently. *If you find the above helpful, and would like me to critique the rest of your profile, let me know.* Otherwise I'll just leave this here.",®

t5_2qh1i,identicalParticle,1360519578,"&gt;The terms Nice Guy™ and nice guy syndrome are used to describe men who view themselves as prototypical ""nice guys,"" but whose ""nice deeds"" are in reality only motivated by attempts to passively please women into a relationship and/or sex.   I always thought that a ""Nice Guy"", was a ""guy"" who was ""nice"".  I suppose if you redefine it as above, then it's tautologically a form of misogyny.    Some people are just nice.  These people will inevitably be taken advantage of some of the time.  That sucks for them, but it's part of life.  And it's a choice they have to make.  If it were easy, we'd all be nice.  Some people think that by appearing nice they can make a woman feel as though she owes him sex or affection.  These people are fucked up.  These are two different sets of people.  I resent the fact that the second one has the same name as the first.  Language is a powerful way to shape thought.  This phrase villainizes the first category along with the second, teaches men that being nice will only be received with suspicion and accusations, and teaches women that they shouldn't expect any genuine kindness from a man.  Fuck. That. Shit.",™

He knowingly went out of his way to steal technology he didn't want or couldn't afford to pay for...and was dumb enough to brag about it.  Another point.  **Accidental Cross Pollination Lawsuits have NEVER happened**   Please read Organic Seed Growers and Trade Association et al. v. Monsanto Company et al., No. 1:11-cv-2163-NRB (S.D.N.Y.). The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York found that Monsanto has never threatened or strong armed a farmer or sued for accidental cross pollination. When the OSGATA was asked to provide proof of any case or situation where Monsanto had done that they found nothing.  All the money funneled into the anti-GMO fever couldn't find one single case where Monsanto had gone after farmers for accidental cross contamination.  This is a lie that keeps getting repeated on Reddit and other places.  http://www.osgata.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/OSGATA-v-Monsanto-MTD-Decision.pdf  The Supreme Court will rule in favor of Monsanto, that the patent clearly is designed to protect the activities of growing the crop and weed suppression.    The fact the plant reproduces is irrelevant, as that obviously is a feature the product has to have to make it a worthwhile crop.  This is much ado about nothing.  This isn't 'One man standing up against Monsanto', it is one guy who is riding the anti-GMO party all the way up the steps to the Supreme Court.   ",®

t5_2vjk7,Riddla26,1360531504,"Well, consider stepping away from Samsung. I'm really not a big fan of their Touchwiz UI and - while cool - the dual window stuff on the Note 2 is a bit of a gimmick, what it does is display 2 activities side by side (activity being the android app coder lingo for a screen which a user interacts with) and when you tap one it's active and you can use it, but tapping the other takes a second for it to respond to inputs as if you were switching tasks in the recent list (which essentially you are doing), making the whole experience slightly sucky, according to reviews.  Consider the Nexus 4. It's build by LG but designed in direct partnership with Google. The Nexus line has a build of Android from AOSP (Android Open Source Project) which is the main repository all the other manufacturers build from and then stick their ugly-ass skins on top off, so you're really getting the pure Android experience with it. It also comes with fantastic hardware - literally unbeaten at it's price point. I love the crap out of mine. If you don't really mind having non-expandable storage - I've found 16Gb to be plenty for me - then it's a pretty big no brainer when you consider the specs and you'll get the latest updates to Android first for the lifetime of the device, before any other phone. It's also considerably cheaper than the other two when bought directly from Google.  4.7"" 1280 x 768 pixel resolution (320 ppi)   WXGA IPS   8 MP (main)   1.3 MP (front)   Qualcomm Snapdragon™ S4 Pro CPU   Adrenos 320 GPU   2 GB RAM   2,100 mAh Lithium polymer battery  https://play.google.com/store/devices/details?id=nexus_4_16gb",™

t5_2s7tt,mizzencog,1360534301,"I keep trying to explain this to my dad, who was brought up in a household where education was considered a privilege and therefore he wanted me to have as much of it as possible as I was growing up. I loved doing my degree, I'm fully prepared to pay my loans, and I'm thankful for my parents for supporting me through it...but in this job market, I'm pretty much fucked, as I have too much education and not enough experience. Therefore, jobs like retail (I've worked retail before and I really enjoyed it) aren't interested in even interviewing me, and jobs for offices etc. interview me and then ask me why I have no experience and don't even bother to let me know I didn't get the job.  Considering I'm in a comfortable position this is a real First World Problem™, but the thing is that I really want to work. I *love* working - because then I have income, which makes me happy. I even went through a spate of not putting my degree down on my CV...but employers were then asking why I didn't do anything between 2007 and 2010. *facepalm*   tl;dr feel for you, OP.

t5_2qjii,Soupstorm,1360535317,"In order to do anything worth doing, you need both a long-term plan for that thing to fit into, and people to help you do it. Social change can't happen through one person.  There's a rising trend of... to put it simply, ""fuck fascists"". I believe this is extremely harmful to socialist change. It breeds divisiveness both inside and outside the socialist group, which has two effects: 1) it makes it more difficult to sway people to our side (as people are by their nature resistant to change, which only becomes stronger when presented with pressure to conform), and 2) it causes infighting between people who are already socialist. We see that every day here, with people attacking each other for this-or-that violation of what he-or-she thinks is Real Socialism™, and it removes almost all possibility of reasonable debate and the changing of opinions that is meant to emerge from discussion.  So if you ask me, I think the first step is to be more open to others who disagree with you. Allow your views to be challenged by them, so they might allow you to do the same. It's the only way to truly change a mind. Any divisive approach is nothing but tribalism and will only hurt the socialist movement in the long run.",™

t5_2snuc,shon821,1360545101,"&gt; God is not responsible for the deaths of the people in the way often conceived, as though the efficient cause. I can explain this more if you would like.  I think human sin is given as an excuse but... Flood? Sodom and Gomorrah? Don't they count?  &gt; As such, and by application of an Aristotelian/Thomistic ethical system, God cannot make evil good, or good evil, at least not in the sense of reversing them. (He might, however, be able to bring good out of evil, as when a person uses a failure to grow in an area of personality that was lacking--though even here, I think the person could have done so without the evil, and the evil was not ""God's Plan"".)  &gt; ""Divine Command theory seems to fail, to me, as it separates morals from the nature of God."" &gt; ""God cannot make evil good, or good evil.""   To me, it feels like these two statements are at odds. If God cannot make evil good, or good evil, doesn't that mean he answers to an outside moral source? It would kind of make sense then that evil creeps in that was not a part of his plan.  &gt; ""Victimless"" crime is something much more complex and controversial than you make it seem. In my experience, it means simply the actor does not see the harm they cause, not that they cause none.  Does this lead to God being the victim? I'm assuming if he is ultimately the one offended by sin, then this is what the argument boils down to. And is offense worthy being tortured for eternity, assuming Hell exists in this scenario?  &gt; Even if one took DTC to be correct, simply because God could, abstractly, make good to be evil, and the reverse, doesn't mean He would. That could easily be given as the reason, since the Bible assures many times that God does not change in character.  Is it possible for God to lie? If so, how do we know anything he says is true? What do you think about the following verses and what they may imply on your previous statements. From the same verse:   Exodus 32:14  International Standard Version (©2012) So the LORD changed his mind about the calamity he had said he would bring on his people.  King James Bible (Cambridge Ed.) And the LORD repented of the evil which he thought to do unto his people.  &gt; I am missing something about the fairness and the fruit. Please explain again!  If we have a sense of fairness largely derived from knowledge of right and wrong, which according to Genesis comes from eating the forbidden fruit. Do we have knowledge of good and evil or not? If so, why can't we judge God's actions as depicted in the Bible? In effect, isn't that also reaching into the morality outside of god that I mentioned earlier?",©

The only thing that matters is defending your discrimination as completely fair and to avoid examining your prejudiced arguments in ways that may challenge them. You could even drop this little bomb: “You are damaging your cause by being angry, real understanding can only happen if all sides are respectful and patient”.*   *Not only do you come across as a smug, self-righteous asshat (though you may prefer the term “bigger person”) you can also manage to subtly make them feel guilty about their anger, as though it’s undeserved!

t5_2cneq,DulcetFox,1360546522,"&gt;Right, no reason to be scared at all. So say you're a farmer, and you want to grow soybeans. Problem is, your neighbor is also growing soybeans. That's all right, you can establish a buffer zone between his crop and yours. Now where does this buffer zone come from? That's right, you have to establish a buffer on your own land to try to ensure that your crops aren't contaminated.   You don't have to establish a buffer zone, this is total bs.  &gt;After all this, there's still no guarantee that your seed doesn't have more than ""trace amounts"" on Monsanto DNA (I've haven't seen them quantify what trace amounts are, what does that even mean?).  Monsanto doesn't sue farmers for accidental contamination of their fields, period. The farmer that you mentioned earlier, Bowman, knew that he had Monsanto seed. He bought seed from a granary which he suspected was Roundup resistant, he then planted it and sprayed it with Roundup, confirming that it was indeed Roundup resistant. He then seed saved the Roundup resistant crop and planted it year after year. I don't mean to bore with with a wall of text, but this is from the [court proceedings](http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/11-796-2012_02_27-Brief-in-Opposition_100943262_1.pdf):  &gt;Bowman planted Roundup Ready® seeds with actual notice that Monsanto considered this activity to infringe its patents. Because Bowman received actual notice under § 287(a) as of June 11, 1999, the court need not reach the issue of constructive notice through marking. Accordingly, Monsanto may recover damages under § 287.  &gt;Because of the popularity of the Roundup Ready® seeds with farmers in the area, Bowman anticipated that a large percentage of the commodity beans he bought might contain the Roundup Ready® trait. Accordingly, he treated his second soybean crop with a glyphosate-based herbicide. As it turns out, testing has shown Bowman was correct in anticipating that the vast majority of commodity beans he planted would be resistant to the herbicide as a result of their containing the Roundup Ready®trait. Each year, beginning in 1999, Bowman would save seeds from his second crop to use with additional commodity beans for planting as the second crop the following year. He has always bought Roundup Ready seeds from Pioneer for his first crop and has never saved seed from that crop.2  &gt;When Monsanto discovered that Bowman was growing more soybeans which contained the Roundup Ready® trait than the quantity of his Roundup Ready® seed purchases could generate, it became suspicious of his activities. Monsanto contacted Bowman and accused him of saving seed. Bowman did not attempt to hide his planting activities and through numerous correspondence with various Monsanto representatives and attorneys, he explained what he was doing with regard to his second crop of soybeans and indicated his belief that this was not a violation of any of Monsanto’s patent rights. Monsanto disagreed and eventually filed this lawsuit.  &gt;1. Bowman claims to have used “commodity beans” prior to 1999 when planting a risky crop, but 1999 is the year he began saving seeds from a second soybean crop which he knew had retained the Roundup Ready® trait. &gt;2. During one year, Bowman did purchase a small amount of Roundup Ready® seed from another farmer at the market price, and asserts that this is a common practice between farmers when one has leftover seed which cannot be returned.",®

So your argument is to insist that Ron Paul is right and the US trademark database is wrong, with zero evidence, on the basis that the alternative is that Ron Paul would be a liar.   &gt; sufñcient to establish common law trademark rights  http://tcattorney.typepad.com/ip/2008/06/what-are-common.html  *But common law trademark rights are not preferred, as they extend only to the places where a trademark has been used in commerce.  Additionally, they do not offer the benefits of federal registration with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, such as the ability to recover profits, statutory damages, attorneys fees, treble (triple) damages for willful infringement, national priority, and the right to use the ® to give notice of rights in a mark.*  In other words, ""common law"" trademark rights do not give Ron Paul any of the protections he is seeking.  Moreover, trademark protections can be forfeited if you aren't aggressive in maintaining them.  The fact that Ron Paul neglected to bid on his own domain name when it went up for auction in 2008, and the fact that he had no problem with the domain while he was still running for president, means that he basically forfeited the weak argument he came up with.  Ron Paul is grasping at straws.  Common law trademark rights are considered an act of desperation, and they are *very* limited in what they can do.  Can you come up with a *single* example of legal precedent of a domain registration being overturned because of a common law trademark?  Heck, can you come up with legal precedent that demonstrates that the author name falls under common law trademark in the first place?  &gt; RON PAUL has long been associated with Dr. PauVs books, articles, public appearances, and political commentary  So if there's another person in America who's name happens to be Ron Paul, he wouldn't be allowed to write books, articles, make public appearances, comment on policy, etc without violating a trademark?  Because that sounds pretty draconian.  Does Ron Paul think that it's illegal for two authors to both share the same name?  Because again, I'm pretty sure that trademark law doesn't work like that.  But if you think I'm wrong, feel free to provide legal precedent.",®

t5_2qi6d,msashlee,1360602293,"Thank you (and the others who did) for saying this.  If you're not the original owner its also a good idea to get a hold of the manufacturer's manual as well, I was able to get a pdf for mine from Google.  ~~Unless~~ Even [if] you have a good mechanical background and knowledge of the systems at work in an engine, you need to spend the money on a Clymer manual for your bike.  Eventually it will pay for itself when you don't fuck up a $200 part because you don't have the proper information.  It also removes the guess work in repairs and that nagging question 'I hope I'm doing this right and not going to break anything.'  Mine was more than worth it and I wouldn't hesitate to buy one for every bike I buy in the future.  Also, after your socket set, get a torque wrench, more likely two, one for high torques (Tightening motor mounts, wheel nuts, etc.) and one for smaller torque values (nuts and bolts on carbs, engine heads, etc.)  I bought a 3/8"" drive and a 1/4"" drive torque wrench, for higher torques and lower torques respectively (even though I operate mostly metric, my rule of thumb is ft-lbs with 3/8"" and ft-inches with 1/4"".)  Also, depending on how deep you are going be prepared to purchase the occasional specialized tool when you need it; you'll always have it for the next time and life can be so much easier with the right tool.  Lastly, when wrenching on your bike, you can miss stuff on a car and have a much wider safety margin than your bike; I view it like working on an aircraft, triple check yourself (or more, especially in the beginning), small overlooked details on your bike can be devastating. Bike stands are great (front and rear), not only for working on the bike as it is upright, but also for winter storage to keep your tires off that cold pavement.  I haven't been able to put all my thoughts in here, kind of sitting at work right now, but you can always find help if you are unsure, I'm sure r/motorcycles will help you out anytime, and you can even private message me, I'll help you out if I feel comfortable to and if I don't, we can find answers together!

I ended up taking the decision to drop out and it was probably for the best although I regret it a little.  I think that 17 is probably just too young to leave the tiny village you grew up in and move to a city...!  3) When I was talking to the Very Cute Guy from the nightshift about a festival we were both going to attend.  It turned out that I had attended in 1996 when I went for the first time.  He said, ""Oh, wow, I was four.""  No more flirting for me :D  4) The Wizard of Oz.  Excellent tunes, still looks stunning even now and the Wicked Witch is one of the best villains EVER!  5) I'm the Doctor.  I have loved Doctor Who since I was a wee girl and the thought of running off to see all of time and space is really appealing.  6) No kids here, I'm militantly child-free.  No offence to parents, but it's just not my thing!  That being said, [FURBABIES](http://imgur.com/dewnW)!  Mine are called Bert and Ernie (Ernie is the one with the moustache).  They're old, fat and spoiled and they drive me crazy every day.  I wouldn't be without them.  7) I'm a reasonably open book.  I did steal a magnet from a shop when I was about eight, I don't think anyone knows about that.  8) I would read.  I love a spoiler :)  9) My greatest accomplishment is buying my own home at the age of 23 and filling it with two cats and the love of my life, Mr Fresian (well, not-quite Mr Fresian as he STILL hasn't proposed, haha!)  I'm happy and healthy and safe and that's about as accomplished as I'm looking to be.  10) Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind because it shows that no matter the bad times, the love should always remain.

t5_2cneq,julesofarc,1360605639,"The Fifth Reich and How The New World Order Collapsed                                by Stuart Wilde    If you tell people this world is controlled by a hidden elite they will probably say, ""Yeah, sure."" But they won't really believe you. They don't want to. Nobody likes to hear they are being betrayed. It's more comfortable to pretend things are reasonable, fair and democratic. Any suggestion of a conspiracy must be the ravings of madmen. Yet, every major politician in the western world and all the media owners and prominent financial and industrial figures are members of two organizations, the Bildebergers and the Trilateral Commission.  It has been well documented by authors like David Icke (Children of the Matrix–see below), that elections in our western democracies are a prearranged sham, contested between members of these two same societies. But the societies are just fronts; behind them are the people who really control the world. Our politicians are puppets in the hands of a few dozen families. They have been bought off with money and the promise of power and the threat of collapse if they don't toe the line. Who is behind the Bildebergers and the Trilateral Commission? Who is running the show?  Prominent Jewish families have been identified as the moneybags behind our leaders and there is no argument that the media is in their grip. But the fact that the Jewish families have the Federal Reserve and so America by the balls is only part of the story. Anyone with a bit of cash has America by the balls because legislation in America is a commodity you can buy. The rich get richer; the poor can’t pay, so they get poorer. It’s a feeding frenzy of self-interest: Gulf oil sheiks, industrialists, arms manufacturers, energy companies, pharmaceutical companies, farmers and special interest groups–it’s all up for sale.  The American government is a puppet of those in the industrial-military complex that can legally buy political favors and allegiances with massive bribes and donations, which are often paid with money provided by the taxpayers in the first place. In the last two decades, Israel has received ninety-three billion dollars from the American government. Only a small percentage of such vast sums have to filter back to the corruption in Washington to ensure Israel gets another ninety-three billion. What goes around comes around, under the table, of course.  It was a time of unbridled rejoicing. People ran amok. They didn't care; they had survived. Promiscuity was rife; no one worried about marriage, fidelity, safe sex, AIDS or anything anymore. They just wanted to express their physicality. There were orgies of eating and drinking, drugs and sex and random violence. Everything was allowed–S &amp; M, wild gatherings of thousands of people having sex openly with multiple partners, public executions, Satanic rituals were televised, sacrifices and all manner of hitherto unconscionable behavior became normal. Africa was a living hell.  People settled old scores and murder and theft was rife, as the police stopped arresting people. They either ignored their behavior and allowed it, or they shot them dead, then and there in the street when they felt like it. No one bothered with arrest and trials anymore. The madness and jubilation was short-lived for after a while, once they had all shown their true colors, the unseen armies that had come from another world to destroy them returned.  About fifty of the Australian elite fell in two days and the Snake's rigid control of that country in alliance with corrupt Australians was exposed. People learned of a murder of a much-loved Australian who had been killed some years before by the Australian government on instructions from America. They were shocked and angry.  The American-Australian alliance never recovered. Queensland tried to pull out of the Commonwealth of Australia and the government in Canberra threatened to attack. But by now, Canberra was so weak and helpless and terrified, they weren't thinking properly. The officers of the Australian army on the side of the government refused to fire on other Australians, and so Canberra changed its mind and ordered the army to withdraw.  A lake in New Zealand was discovered to be something other than a tourist resort as people had imagined it to be, and that shocked the Kiwis. The country had gone broke a while before and the government, which was very shaky anyway, fell, and the Snake was sent packing. It didn't want New Zealand. It was too small and too remote. Anyway, the problems of the Snake worldwide were too great.  The way the Communist party of China collapsed–what was left of it by then, was truly transcendental. The dragon came back and ate them–chop suey. Beijing was almost completely destroyed. Still, nobody had ever liked Beijing, so people didn't miss it.  Anyway, I better not distress you too much with the details, but as a general idea, things unraveled. Everyone knew something big was about to happen. Visionaries and experts and even New Age psychics got on TV to offer their views but they were all wrong.  Meanwhile, the little people who could 'see' who by now, were not as little as they used to be, refused to join the mayhem and the orgies of sex and violence. Instead they drifted away to remote areas that no one wanted, and they joined the warriors from 10-D in the etheric, who now numbered hundreds of thousands.  At first, people didn't realize they had joined the forces of light, as the 10-D warriors used them silently for good, just as the TDs had used demonic humans for bad. But over a short period of time, the little people had learned all the etheric tricks the TDs knew and more. By now, ordinary people had learned to see their etheric allies, so they weren't scared anymore. They came to realize they were a part of an angelic 10-D world after all. They could see it. The celestial world was all around them, and now they were comfortable in it. They grew up fast. It was the 10-D etheric warriors in alliance with the humans who could 'see' who wiped out the TDs, and wrote the final chapter.  Once the people had found their courage, and once they had learned to 'see' they used that to protect the children, and with the TDs gone the Brotherhood of the Snake very quickly imploded through the weight of its darkness. As they went, hundreds of millions went with them, literally overnight.  It was the little people that saved the day. I didn't know many of them, but the ones I did know, I liked a lot. They were brave.  Eventually, for a while, the world was given back to the animals.  ©Stuart Wilde 2002 www.stuartwilde.com",©

It really held me back into getting in software and technology. But that didn't stop me, I was aware of you and companies like Microsoft. I used to steal money from my grandmas purse to be able to rent a pc in cafés. I studied and toyed with windows for awhile. Now I have grown and I work as a freelance software developer online. And I own a surface Rt , a windows phone and a windows desktop. I want my own startup company someday, but its a bit hard here in the Philippines.  Sorry for such a long post. But before anything else I just want to ask you this.   What do you think it takes today to be the next Bill Gates, considering all the advancement in technology already? Is there something a single entity can do to make a dent like you did in your time?

Which isn't even a difficult concept to grasp, if you were raised Christian. God does all kinds of things in the Bible which would be horribly wicked if humans did them (wiping out all of humanity with the Flood), but it's considered Good™ because He did it. We are not God's equals and therefore there are limits on our behavior that He doesn't have.  This argument is essentially an extension of that, basically saying that *anything* God does, no matter how depraved it may seem to us, would be considered Good™ because of the being who performed it.",™

t5_2qpco,hebug,1360620776,"**Not Cocktail of the Week #6: Ramos Gin Fizz**   I elected to have my NCotW post take place a early to allow you to prepare a cocktail for Fat Tuesday, the big party day associated with Mardi Gras. DrammingSpeed (where is that guy now anyways?) previously wrote up the Sazerac, another famous classic cocktail originating from new Orleans, in his Cocktail of the Week series [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/14qgow/cocktail_of_the_week_2_sazerac/), so for this week’s column, I will write about another famous cocktail from New Orleans, the Ramos Gin Fizz. Also testing a new format, let me know what you think!  **Background**   The Ramos Gin Fizz originates from 1888 by Henry C. Ramos in New Orleans first at the Meyer’s Table d’Hotel Internationale before he brought it with him to the Imperial Cabinet Saloon. One of the city’s most venerated cocktails, it was originally called the New Orleans Fizz and due to the time-consuming nature of making this drink, despite having over twenty “bartenders” (essentially human paint shakers in this case) working assembly line style, they were barely able to meet demand. After Ramos took over the Stag saloon in 1907, he continued to serve his famous fizz until Prohibition was enacted. His fizz was so popular that customers would wait as long as an hour to get their hands on an authentic Ramos Fizz. At Mardi Gras in 1915, it was reported that “35 shaker boys nearly shook their arms off, but still were unable to keep up with demand”.   Of course, when Prohibition was enacted, the cocktail scene changed but luckily in this case, the popularity of the Ramos Gin Fizz was brought back by the 40th governor of Louisiana and later member of the US Senate, Huey P. Long aka “The Kingfish”. It turns out that “The Kingfish” was very fond of the Ramos Gin Fizz as he had the head bartender of the Roosevelt Hotel in New Orleans (to which Henry Ramos sold his rights to the name after the repeal of Prohibition), Sam Guarino, travel to New York with him in 1935 to teach the staff there how to make it. There is newsreel footage of this cocktail at this event where he lambasted President Roosevelt’s New Deal, which obviously played a large part in introducing this famous cocktail to the world and immortalizing it (photo [here](http://imgur.com/CSRCIWL). Nowadays, the Roosevelt Hotel is the Fairmont and one can still stop in and have an authentic Ramos Gin Fizz if one is in the vicinity.  **Recipes**   *Time Magazine* October 1st, 1928   Fizzmaker Ramos’ recipe   * 1 tablespoonful powdered sugar   * 3 or 4 drops of orange flower water   * juice of one-half lime   * juice of one-half lemon   * one jigger of Old Tom gin   * white of one egg   * one-half glass of crushed ice   * 2 tablespoonfuls rich milk or cream   * an ounce of seltzer for pungency   Shake till milklike in an air-tight shaker and strain   “Died. Henry Charles (“Carl”) Ramos, 72, veteran New Orleans saloonkeeper, inventor of the famed, much-imitated Ramos gin fizz, in New Orleans”  *Savoy Cocktail Book* in the “Fizzes” section   New Orleans Gin Fizz   * The Juice of ½ lemon   * ½ tablespoonful powdered sugar   * the white of 1 egg   * 1 glass of dry gin (approx. 2 oz)   * 3 dashes fleur d’orange (1/2 tsp)   * 1 tablespoonful of sweet cream   Shake well, strain into long tumbler and fill with syphon soda water   Seen [here](http://savoystomp.com/2011/08/01/new-orleans-fizz/)  *PDT Cocktail Book*   * 2 oz Beefeater gin   * 0.75 oz heavy cream   * 0.75 oz simple syrup (1:1)   * 0.5 oz lime juice   * 0.5 oz lemon juice   * 5 drops Marivani orange flower water   * 1 egg white   Dry-shake, shake with ice, and strain into a chilled Collins glass   Top with 1 oz club soda   *George Kappeler*, Modern American Drinks, *1895*  *Links and Further Reading*   [Article](http://www.artofdrink.com/archive/popular-cocktails/ramos-gin-fizz-cocktail/) via Art of Drink   [Article](http://www.cocktailchronicles.com/2005/09/11/in-praise-of-difficult-drinks-part-i-the-ramos-gin-fizz/) via The Cocktail Chronicles   [Article](http://www.cocktailmusings.com/2010/03/ramos-gin-fizz.html) via Musings on Cocktails   [Video](http://www.smallscreennetwork.com/video/86/cocktail_spirit_ramos_gin_fizz) via The Cocktail Spirit with Robert Hess   [Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uj417erX2W8) of Chris McMillian making a Ramos Gin Fizz  **Results**   Instead of the usual Beefeater London dry gin called for in the PDT recipe, I elected to use Hendrick’s gin, a unique dry gin made in Scotland that is known for the addition of Bulgarian rose and cucumber to its flavor. I felt that its light floral characteristics would meld well with the fruity and airy profile of this cocktail.   Making this cocktail is EXHAUSTING. The last time I made this cocktail I did a minute dry shake followed by a minute shake on ice. In an attempt to be more authentic, this time I managed a 5 minute dry shake, followed by a full minute shake on ice. I’ve never tried the Shake Weight®, but I can definitely see how it works after making the Ramos Gin Fizz as my upper arms and shoulders are very tired. Note to self: Shake Weight® as an exercise to increase a bartenders’ stamina?   The cocktail itself is really quite delicious and unique, a very smooth and creamy texture that blends seamlessly with the fruitiness of citrus and orange flower water. Not too sweet, not bracingly sour, this is a very pleasant cocktail that I wish I had made a double recipe for since it goes by much too fast for all of the work that goes into it. You can definitely understand why Ramos needed so many shaker boys for this.   One trick that I tried was to pour my seltzer water on the remnants of the cocktail left in the shaker tin to generate foam and then add that additional foam to the cocktail. Unfortunately, I did not let my water chill sufficiently before charging with carbon dioxide, so there is not as much foam as expected, but it was nonetheless a rewarding experience.    **Variations**   Other than the inherent variation from recipe to recipe, the only variation I came across was the addition of vanilla extract in addition to the orange flower water which presumably results in a sweeter and creamier experience. Some believe that vanilla extract is a “secret ingredient” that Ramos included in his cocktail, but given the color it imparts, it would be difficult to hide. The *Time Magazine* recipe, is the only one which calls for Old Tom gin, which might be an interesting variation, though my arms do not have the fortitude required to do a side-by-side tasting, I would be interested in hearing your experience if anyone manages to make it.   **Egg Whites**   Fizzes are an underappreciated class of cocktails, partially due to the relatively time-consuming and laborious preparation. The extra effort involved in emulsifying the ingredients can be bypassed by using an immersion blender or potentially a blender, but primarily their decline in popularity is due to public health concerns. It’s unfortunate that people are afraid of trying traditional cocktails containing egg whites which give a unique silky mouthfeel and can help smooth some of the rougher edges of a cocktail, melding the flavors together better. As we all know, the concern with using raw eggs is potential contamination with Salmonella, a bacteria that can cause food poisoning. At last report, the CDC estimated that approximately [1 in 20,000](http://www.cdc.gov/nczved/divisions/dfbmd/diseases/salmonella_enteritidis/) eggs is contaminated with Salmonella, an individuals’ risk of contracting Salmonella at [11.3 in 100,000](http://www.breakingtheviciouscycle.info/knowledge_base/detail/salmonella-in-eggs-weighing-up-the-risks/), and given that the type on eggs only accounts for 17.7% of Salmonella, it’s basically less than a 1 in 100,000 chance that consumption of raw eggs over the course of a year will result in food poisoning. Still, it’s higher than getting hit by lightning (1 in 280,000 for reference). If you’re that unlucky, you may want to try using powdered pasteurized egg whites. Hopefully if you’re daring enough to venture out during a thunderstorm, you’ll try a traditional Ramos Gin Fizz or a whiskey sour with some raw egg white.  **Cheers!**   Hope you all have a safe Mardi Gras and will have an opportunity to kick off Fat Tuesday with a Ramos Gin Fizz; or if you’re not observing Lent, use one Wednesday morning to battle that hangover; and if you’re really adventurous, have them both days!

t5_2qxih,drebz,1360623342,"02.11.2013   **Game Update 1.7 Developer Blog: Relics of the Gree Event**  **The Event**  “Relics of the Gree” is a new, recurring event in Star Wars™: The Old Republic™ that takes place in the Western Ice Shelf on Ilum. The old battlefield between the Republic and the Empire has been transformed into a crucible for Gree research, and all players at level 45+ are invited to participate!  **The Story**  An ancient and powerful Gree starship has suddenly appeared and touched down in the midst of the frozen battlegrounds of the planet Ilum. Launched by the Gree’s ancestors long ago to explore and study the furthest reaches of the galaxy, the fully-automated vessel has been hyper-jumping from one star system to the next for uncounted centuries, examining the planets it discovers and analyzing how their native species respond to various stimuli, from mild atmospheric alterations to direct attacks.  For the modern Gree, the starship has come to be known as ‘Gray Secant,’ and carries an almost religious significance. Having long forgotten the techniques and intentions of their ancient predecessors, the Gree can only look back on their ancestors’ works with deeply-felt reverence and do their best to keep them functional. The reappearance of this unfathomably sophisticated starship is incredibly exciting for the Gree, and they want to do anything they can to further Gray Secant’s now-mythic purpose. Since the starship seems to have taken an interest in Ilum’s battles between the Republic and the Empire, the Gree have reached out to exceptional individuals from both factions, offering lavish rewards for those who travel to Ilum’s battlegrounds to fight and provide data for the Secant’s grand mission of galactic analysis.  **Ilum Transformed**  The Western Ice Shelf on Ilum has been completely transformed by Gray Secant’s arrival. Gree architecture now grows from the ice, and enemies lurk everywhere. The old, defunct Imperial base has been eradicated by Gray Secant, and the Republic base lies abandoned far to the south. The Empire and the Republic have set up research camps to study the Secant – camps which double as staging platforms for forays into the contested area in the south.  The Secant’s arrival has changed the terms of the battle on Ilum. This is a PvP region restricted to groups of four players competing over limited resources to achieve daily mission objectives. Operations groups are disallowed in the Southern Bowl, but on PvP servers, the Northern Bowl will still host large-scale conflicts between the Empire and the Republic.  Many repeatable missions are available at each research camp, and those that require entering the Southern Bowl are flagged as [PvP]. These [PvP] missions do not directly require killing players, but the nature of the objectives will pit your group against all others in the region as you compete for limited resources in a relatively dense area. Additionally, the Secant’s Droids™ are weaker in the Southern Bowl, making Heroic objectives easier to complete if your group risks a foray into the contested area.  **Preparing for the Event**  The Western Ice Shelf now applies a Bolster effect to all players (but not Companions), similar to Warzones. Although enemies are level 50, level 45 players should be on equal enough ground to complete their mission objectives. If you plan to participate in the [PvP] missions, however, you will have an easier time if you pick up Recruit Mk-2 gear from the Fleet (this gear requires level 50).  **Rewards**  The Event Missions available during the “Relics of the Gree” event all grant Reputation Trophies for the Gree Enclave, in addition to commendations and credits. Access to titles, adaptive gear, and mini-pets can be unlocked with Reputation Ranks, and those who earn the trust of the Gree will be invited aboard Gray Secant itself!  Additionally, special “Gray Helix” weapons can be purchased with weapon component tokens that can be earned by completing certain missions or defeating the Operation boss at the heart of Gray Secant. These weapons are crafted from ancient Gree technology - you’ll find nothing quite like them in the known Galaxy.  **Ongoing Research**  “Relics of the Gree” is a new recurring in-game event in Star Wars: The Old Republic. Gray Secant will come and go from Ilum as it continues its millennial mission to gather and analyze infinite data. The event will end when Gray Secant achieves Red Radian and departs the planet – but look forward to its return!  Jesse Sky   Lead Flashpoints and Operations Designer",™
t5_2qh1m,letsgetrandy,1360623642,"I think most people are still figuring it out, and there is no proven *One Right Way*™.  At least not yet.  Personally, I find the ""mobile first"" dogma to be completely wrong. Not only on the principle that it makes your full-size site suffer in terms of features (it does!) but also because it pre-supposes that we *know* what size mobile is.  We don't.  An iPhone 4S will report its resolution as 320x480, in spite of having twice as many pixels as that, while the larger Xperia X10 has worse resolution, but reports dimensions of 480x854. Meanwhile a Galaxy S-III will tell you it's got 720x1280. Can anyone really tell me that starting with a ""mobile first"" strategy is going to satisfy Samsung users and iPhone users in a remotely comparable way?  Now consider a 800x1280 Nexus 7 tablet -- nearly identical resolution to a Galaxy phone, but this much larger device expects to be treated as a tablet, not a phone.... and it has more pixels than an iPad, which is another 3 inches bigger!  So, how should a ""mobile-first"" site handle a Galaxy S-III? and how does that 4.8-inch experience ruin the experience for an iPad 4?  For the moment, I can't imagine how media queries alone are enough to deliver an acceptable experience to users. Knowing your audience helps, but it's still imperfect. And sadly, while we were hoping for the end of user-agent based redirects, the fragmentation of device resolutions is only introducing more *new* problems, rather than solving old ones.  It seems almost indisputable that we have to do some gymnastics in our source code -- partly on the server, partly in javascript, and partly in CSS media queries -- to handle this.  For my money, I think examining the user-agent to add "".phone"" or "".tablet"" classes (or something similar) to the &lt;html&gt; element is a start. Or perhaps using the user-agent to determine which CSS file(s) to load is even better.  From there, it's still necessary to use media queries, because different users still use different screens -- one might have a 1600px-wide monitor, while another may be on an 800x400 netbook.  It's an extremely difficult problem to solve, and anyone who tells you they know the answer, or who mentions any ""best practices"", should be completely ignored for the idiot s/he is.  Best bet? Do your own research, solve the problems that match your audience, and bend like a reed in the wind.  **TL;DR**  * Galaxy S-III  -- size: 4.8"" -- resolution: 720x1280 * iPad 4 -- size: 9.7"" -- resolution: 768x1024  * How do you optimize for space when the smaller device *has more space*?  *Note: the iPad actually has twice as many pixels as it reports. Safari lies about its resolution, theoretically to get better results. In practice, this only makes everything worse.*",™

I formed a political action committee. (I became the treasurer.)  We used ""Robert's rules"" and the local library to meet and get more people. we went on a voter registration drive and got a lot of people to become voters.    So, My group and the group protecting the bums  got together and pushed to create a binding referendum and had it put on the ballot that this CRB would be created.    After it passed the old police chief stepped down and then we went through 3 more. Only a few cops have been punished but their demeanor has sharply improved.   In hindsight, I would like to warn you: When you create your CRB you should not place too high a bar of entry for being on it., as that is what the ""system"" uses to say ""but not you"". And don't make it a specific number of board members, may be just a few ""officers"" but make it be an unlimited number of board members so long as they meet the minimum requirements (They live in that 9 square mile square?) and want to show up. And do NOT let any body who collects a government check to be on it. (Conflict of interest)   Good luck!   And carry a camera...",☺

All of the films we viewed, with the exception of I believe two, were made in the time between Stalin's death in 1953 and the fall of the Soviet Union in 1990. All of the films were great, but of course I can only remember the ones that I particularly enjoyed the most...  -[Ashes and Diamonds](http://www.criterion.com/films/342-ashes-and-diamonds) (1958)  On the last day of World War II in a small town somewhere in Poland, Polish exiles of war and the occupying Soviet forces confront the beginning of a new day and a new Poland. In this incendiary environment we find Home Army soldier Maciek Chelmicki, who has been ordered to assassinate an incoming commissar. But a mistake stalls his progress and leads him to Krystyna, a beautiful barmaid who gives him a glimpse of what his life could be. Gorgeously photographed and brilliantly performed, Ashes and Diamonds masterfully interweaves the fate of a nation with that of one man, resulting in one of the most important Polish films of all time.  -[The Shop on Main Street](http://www.criterion.com/films/669-the-shop-on-main-street) (1965)  An inept Czech peasant is torn between greed and guilt when the Nazi-backed bosses of his town appoint him “Aryan controller” of an old Jewish widow’s button shop. Humor and tragedy fuse in this scathing exploration of one cowardly man’s complicity in the horrors of a totalitarian regime. Made near the height of Soviet oppression in Czechoslovakia, The Shop on Main Street features intense editing and camera work which won it the Academy Award™ for Best Foreign Film in 1965.  -[Closely Watched Trains](http://www.criterion.com/films/212-closely-watched-trains) (1966)  At a village railway station in occupied Czechoslovakia, a bumbling dispatcher’s apprentice longs to liberate himself from his virginity. Oblivious to the war and the resistance that surrounds him, this young man embarks on a journey of sexual awakening and self-discovery, encountering a universe of frustration, eroticism, and adventure within his sleepy backwater depot. Wry and tender, Academy Award™-winning Closely Watched Trains is a masterpiece of human observation and one of the best-loved films of the Czech New Wave.           ",™

As I think it is a very sound if not necessary strategy for MS to leverage their presence on gaming consoles and laptops to become relevant in smartphones (and would also start to differentiate them from the pack), I'm sure that this will happen. Clearly, it is not as fast as some of us would like. Mind you though, that a large part of the world is not quite ready for full integration, or at least has difficulties seeing the value of it. MS is a first mover here, and is itself in terms of organization, catching up with its own trendsetting (eg MS game studios not producing for wp8). Gonna be some exciting years ahead though, and I really think that MS is surprisingly well positioned versus competition to take advantage of the integration trend. Now they have to perform - I have full confidence they will.",😊

Epub 2011 May 13.  **Bisphenol A: an endocrine disruptor with widespread exposure and multiple effects.**  Rubin BS.  Source  Department of Anatomy and Cellular Biology, Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, MA 02111, United States. Beverly.rubin@tufts.edu Abstract  Bisphenol A (BPA) is one of the highest volume chemicals produced worldwide. This compound is a building block of polycarbonate plastics often used for food and beverage storage, and BPA is also a component of epoxy resins that are used to line food and beverage containers. Studies have shown that BPA can leach from these and other products in contact with food and drink, and as a result, routine ingestion of BPA is presumed. This compound is also found in an enormous number of other products that we come into contact with daily, and therefore it is not surprising that it has been detected in the majority of individuals examined. BPA is a known endocrine disruptor. Although initially considered to be a weak environmental estrogen, more recent studies have demonstrated that BPA may be similar in potency to estradiol in stimulating some cellular responses. Moreover, emerging evidence suggests that BPA may influence multiple endocrine-related pathways. Studies in rodents have identified adverse effects of BPA at levels at or below the current acceptable daily intake level for this compound. The various reported adverse effects of BPA are reviewed, and potential mechanisms of BPA action are discussed. Much more investigation is needed to understand the potential adverse health effects of BPA exposure in humans and to understand the multiple pathways through which it may act. Although many questions remain to be answered, it is becoming increasingly apparent that exposure to BPA is ubiquitous and that the effects of this endocrine disruptor are complex and wide-ranging.

Basically, if they release something with few options, that is buggy and who is unreliable, people will drop it and never try it again.  So they simply continue working on it to make it efficient. What seems easy but actually isn't :   * Getting the enemy infos without giving them during the match (requires a server copy of the match that may/may not be deleted once everyone disconnected from the game). * Making sure that the replays are backward compatible. You have to have details about every previous patches as well as a fast and reliable way to access that data to be able to see months old replays (S3 Finals may be viewed years later). * Give the opportunity to download said replays and view them offline is a thing most people would expect. Basically, if you always have to stream the datas to your players, it requires a crapton of bandwidth/server load, and limits the player to being online to watch replays. * Privacy concerns : Pro players may want to hide their replays, this would mean that custom games should have a no-replay option. * Bandwidth limitation : You have to find a compact way to get that information, not everyone has unlimited bandwidth, so on their part, having to use 30Gb every months only to play League isn't really attractive. The same applies for Riot... If they triple their bandwidth usage from then on, their ISP won't be that happy (and will most probably charge a LOT more)  Basically, no matter how easy it may seems, there are troubles about it.

t5_2qh6c,twentyone_21,1360703588,"&gt;Everyone in /r/atheism are people. Saying ""people"" doesn't limit it from including anyone.  What? Did I say *all* people? No, I said people. Saying there are bigots in /r/atheism is not a generalization. I'll call this the Pommel Horse, and you just fell off.  &gt;Unfortunately, the biggest Christian bigot on here, LouF, doesn't exist anymore. You should have seen him. He represented your community with gusto, screaming obscenities and hating everyone for any reason. Beautiful.  You use a deleted account of somebody who doesn't exist on Reddit anymore as your argument? Also, you use a 7 day account with relatively no history to counter? Well, let's continue the mental gymnastics to get to your conclusions. You hit your head on the horizontal bar.  &gt;Absolutely, but the studies themselves are still factual, and just because we can't assume it's correct, doesn't mean it's proven not to be correct either. In other words, it's a completely valid and reasonable topic of discussion, even though, admittedly, some people don't choose their words all too well.  That's fair, but again, this doesn't justify an association fallacy. Either way, I agree with that much, so you scored a 9/10 on the parallel bars.   &gt; &gt;a subset of /r/atheism  &gt;entire subreddit  Good work putting words in my mouth, and making a generalization out of something that couldn't be construed as such, unless you changed what I said. You lost your grip on the still rings and fell to the floor.  &gt; &gt;start using your brain here.  &gt;directly calling me stupid  Okay, so if I *directly* called you stupid, wouldn't I say ""You're stupid.""??? Wouldn't this be indirect? Even so, was I insulting your intelligence, or was I asking you to be reasonable here? The latter seems to follow logically, as I asked you to quit playing the mental gymnastics to make me out to be an awful person (only when you change what I say). It is funny, though, that you have changed and added words in my argument to make you try to get the upper-hand. You did the vault, perfect jump, flip, and spins, and ended up with a dismount on your face, knocking player Endemoniada out of the competition.

t5_2qlqp,Okydog,1360711053,"The electronics are only as tough as soldering, everything's passive  The body isnt hard, mark out where you need to route and cut it to shape. Look up the ""swimming pool route"" for strats, its the easiest and you're not limited to any kind of pickups. After that irs sanding and finishing work. You can make the whole body out of maple, however maple is known to sound very bright. There's been since I can remember a debate over the effects of wood type for the body, some believe some think it's negligible. Im no expert but I believe. Take it for what it's worth. A book matched maple top on a mahogany body however is almost industry standard on  any wood finished guitar. Ash is a great one piece/wood option, I have an ash telecaster(look up 60th anniversary telecaster for pics). This one in the post is pine, they said it would sound thin or kinda hollow, it does.  For the inlays I'm guessing the dots on the fret board, allparts.com sells them in all varieties or you could use a wooden dowel from a big box store. The fretboard will be some very hard wood so you can sand down whatever you use to fit, even the ones online are just flat cylinders.   What's your budget? I'll throw together a shopping cart of the parts so you can see all of them, it will help explain a lot.   There is a  truss rod is on every modern steel stringed guitar, and by the nature of how it works, it has to be hidden. It goes the length of the neck and sits under the fingerboard in a routed channel, usually 1/8 wide if I remember.  I kind of forgot about and I havnt talked about fretting the neck yet,  the basics are tap the fret in and clip the excess off,  level them all to each other then file and polish the edges. Im going to take my next one to a shop and just have them put them in. They have the tools and will do it right. It's tough to get them all level with no buzz  Making the neck can become overwhelming, I halted my build at the neck, cause I got scared. eBay has lots of replacement necks for fenders that sell cheap, almost the same price as your materials. It's not a bad option, theres unfinished ones, and even a ""paddle"" head so you can make your own shape up top if you want to.   I like the mahogany pick guard idea a lot, I might make one for my store bought one haha  The pots are the knobs, a 3 knob setup is typically 1 master volume and 2 tones(bridge pickup is one, other 2 are the other on a strat). You can do literally every possible combination with as many knobs as you can fit. There's tons of free wiring diagrams online, your looking at 15 solders probably.    edit: i tried to put a shopping cart together you could look at, i failed heres the copy+paste of it    EP-4120-000 Wiring Kit for Stratocasters®	 	$41.00  LT-0461-000 Medium Fret Wire	 	                $5.00	  SB-0190-010 Non-Tremolo Top-Load Bridge Chrome	$24.00  LT-0474-025 Metric White Inlay Dots	 	        $13.00  AP-0600-010 Chrome Neckplate	 	                $9.00	  TK-7559-010 6-in-line Chrome Economy Keys	 	$25.00  PG-0549-025 White Stratocaster® Accessory Kit 	$19.00  AP-0670-001 Nickel Strap Buttons	 	                $3.90	   Subtotal:	$139.90  TOTAL:	$139.90  its all off allparts.com, you can see its a little more than $100, After that there, you need pickups, and the wood. you  could find most of the the parts in the wiring kit at radio shack alot cheaper, you could make the knobs out of wood, and pickups almost always come with covers, that kit is just an all in one deal, theres lots of places to shave down costs($13 inlay dots! i'd try cut pieces of a $0.50 wooden dowel or get creative at a craft shop). also if you buy a neck, the fret wire and dots go bye bye. Also craigslist and ebay are resources that should not be overlooked. hell a broken guitar with all its hardware could be a good buy, at the right price. ",®

t5_2qstm,canisroot,1360714047,"An IRA is probably your first priority if you are talking about retirement savings. You can choose your broker and investments, unlike a 401k/403/459/pension. &gt;At what point, given my need of a new car in the next couple years and an incoming baby, will I be able to say that I have enough liquid assets to not have to worry about having enough cash on hand?  A child is not going to eat through 3k-4k per month.   Estimate the cost of the car you want and put it aside until you need it. You can invest that in short term, very low risk vehicles if you want, but at today's interest rates it will not matter much. Look for one year CDs, treasury bonds, or money market accounts.  I would wait until your child is born to estimate how much you will actually be able to save each month, and then decide on a set amount to contribute to your IRAs. The link in the sidebar, [Long-Term Investing Start-Up Kit](http://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Bogleheads®_investing_start-up_kit), will help you work out what to actually invest in.  If you max your IRA contribution ($5,500 annually for you, $5,500 for your wife in 2013), increase your 401k contributions. If your wife works in the school system, she probably has access to a 403b or 459 plan. If you have lots of cash you need to sock away after maxing your IRAs, this could be a great way to do it while reducing your taxable income. Of course, it also depends the actual terms of that pension plan you mention.

t5_2qstm,canisroot,1360716424,"Put aside your emergency fund of 3-6 months of expenses. This is going to stay in a bank account for now. Your emergency fund needs to be no risk and high liquidity.  Put aside the funds you need for a down payment on a house and a replacement vehicle. These are not funds that you can invest in the stock market at higher risk. Either keep them in a high yielding savings account (anything above 0.5% would be fine at today's rates) or invest in very low risk, short term investments like FDIC insured bank CDs, money markets, or treasury bonds.  If your 125k doesn't cover the 20% down payment (if you are considering the 800k range that you mention), that will be your next priority. Again, low risk, short term investments if any.  Make sure your wife is contributing up to the maximum matched amount in her 401k (and you as well if you have one, though you didn't mention it).  After that, any additional money you would like to put toward retirement should go to an IRA first (choosing between Roth and traditional IRAs will depend largely on your current tax bracket), and then to the remainder of your 401k contribution limits.  The sidebar link [Long-Term Investing Start-Up Kit](http://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Bogleheads®_investing_start-up_kit) is a good starting point to determine what to actually invest in with your 401k and IRA funds.  As for your purchased mortgage debt, I don't have any useful advice. Don't count on the income, and have a plan for what income you do receive.",®

It's completely transgressive for someone in his position and more of what's needed from privileged people.  I prefer his other film — [The One Percent](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmlX3fLQrEc): &gt;""This 80-minute documentary focuses on the growing ""wealth gap"" in America, as seen through the eyes of filmmaker Jamie Johnson, a 27-year-old heir to the Johnson &amp; Johnson pharmaceutical fortune. Johnson, who cut his film teeth at NYU and made the Emmy®-nominated 2003 HBO documentary Born Rich, here sets his sights on exploring the political, moral and emotional rationale that enables a tiny percentage of Americans - the one percent - to control nearly half the wealth of the entire United States.

Most of the people I grew up with are Lutheran, though there were a few atheists in my school. Two of them were really ""holier than thou"" atheists too, and loved to try start religious arguments with the Lutheran classmates (who obviously didn't have many answers, seeing as they are teenagers whose main reason for being a Lutheran was that their parents were Lutherans....most hadn't yet considered the larger philosophical questions at work in their religion).  Anyway, I always enjoyed playing devil's advocate in those engagements. Most of the time, the two atheists were just reciting arguments they read online, without really understanding the arguments. I had a jolly good time turning their arguments back around on them, tripping them up and getting them flustered. There's nothing more fun than arguing with a ""know-it-all"" who actually knows close to nothing about the subject matter.  Anyway, that was off topic slightly. /u/PriscillaPresley offered the best advice. Go with that, and you'll be fine. ♥",♥

What kind of change do you think would happen exactly? It's not like the regime would topple and suddenly all the issues the DPRK has would be magically resolved and nothing bad would every happen again™.  I mean the DPRK is already a nation teetering on the brink. Going in and fighting a war that would involve destroying a large amount of it's already limited and extremely dated transportation infrastructure and god knows what else would leave millions more people starving. The short term results would be a massive influx of refuges into southern China, an even larger famine as what little food is available is unable to reach the people that need it and not to mention the outbreaks of all kinds of nasty diseases due to people being packed into camps desperately trying to escape the region. And while their would no doubt be huge amounts of foreign aid in the form of food, medicine, etc it wont do much good sitting in port or stuck on the border with no way to distribute it.  In the long term as well modernizing the DPRK would be a decades long project requiring trillions of dollars and a commitment from the international community that just doesn't exist currently.

t5_2qu5n,masqueradestar,1360783074,"I'm not particularly interested in having the debate, but the short(ish) version of my opinion is that  a) I think segregating the terminology into ""polyamory"" and ""nonmonogamy"" and ""swinging"" and etc. is silly, and that everyone is going to have slightly different definitions of what those words mean to them anyway (cf. ""queer"" and similar terms in the LGBTQ* community). Fundamentally, telling someone they can't identify as something because they don't fit your personal definition of it is othering.  b) The etymology argument that polyamory must be about multiple lives because ""poly"" -&gt; many and ""amory"" -&gt; love is bunk. It's like saying you're only monogamous if you're *married* to one person because ""mono"" -&gt; one and ""gamos"" -&gt; marriage. Language is fluid, and the strict Origin Of The Word™ is not the only definition the word will ever have.  c) I think love comes in many forms, and physical ""love"" is one of them. I don't see why it should be any less valid for the sake of identifying as polyamorous than any other kind of love.  There is more, but that's some of it. At the end of the day, though, I don't knock anyone for self-identifying with whatever terms they feel suit them.

t5_2qh1i,OMGorilla,1360791474,"[Matthew 27:12](http://bible.cc/matthew/21-12.htm)   &gt;New Living Translation (©2007) Jesus entered the Temple and began to drive out all the people buying and selling animals for sacrifice. He knocked over the tables of the money changers and the chairs of those selling doves.  Aside from general blasphemy and perceived 'crusade' against the established order of society, it was allegedly this action which led to his crucifixion.   However, the existence of Jesus is still a point of debate. I know the HuffPo article linked in another comment (Written by Bart Ehrman, the author of 'Did Jesus Exist?: The Historical Argument for Jesus of Nazareth') may seem above the spectrum of opinion and speculation. But if you read and evaluate the arguments/counter arguments, you should conclude that they are exactly this.  Though the compelling arguments from the ""mythicist"" camp are also subject to opinion and speculation. It is peculiar that no legitimate historians of the time make any mention of Jesus, except for his followers, despite having such an impact on their society. But we are so removed from their society that it is illogical to speculate their reasons. It is entirely plausible that the idea of the time was to write him out of history.   Tl;dr the arguments both for and against the existence of Jesus are rather weak. Being left to speculation and synchronicities.",©

Leuchter is America's leading specialist on the design and fabrication of execution equipment, including homicidal gas chambers. In 1988, Leuchter scraped samples from the alleged gas chamber walls in Auschwitz, Birkenau and Lublin. Cyanide residue would be clearly evident on all these walls if gassings did occur. To his astonishment, Leuchter found no significant cyanide traces in any one of these rooms.   &gt;In 1991, the Polish government repeated these tests to disprove Leuchter's findings, but they as well found no evidence of any gassings ever occurring.   &gt;The structural integrity of these ""gas chambers"" is also extremely faulty. These rooms have ordinary doors and windows which are not hermetically sealed! There are large gaps between the floors and doors. If the Germans had attempted to gas anyone in these rooms, they would have died themselves, as the gas would have leaked and contaminated the entire area. Also, no equipment exists to exhaust the air-gas mixture from these buildings. Nothing was made to introduce or distribute the gas throughout the chambers. There are no provisions to prevent condensation of gas on the walls, floors or ceilings. No exhaust stacks have ever existed.   and it gos on and on... ",©

t5_2qpp6,fathan,1360814934,"Do you know what would make the hellbat make sense? If building one required ""morphing"" a hellion and a marine -- or hell _any_ bio unit.  Just think about it:    * **Can be healed by medivac.** Well, it's part bio, so obviously. ✔   * **Takes up more space in a medivac.** It's two units combined, so  this make sense. And if you wanted to transport marines &amp; hellions for a hellbat drop then you'd take up 3 supply per hellbat anyway, so you could only take 2. ✔  Of course this would make it more expensive so maybe some buffs would be in order. Off the top of my head:    * Benefits from mech and bio upgrades (only up to +3 still).   * Benefits from blue flame?   * Idk what I'm talking about really so I'll stop now.  Probably not enough time to do anything about it now, but still... there should be _some_ lore so the hellbat makes sense.",✔
t5_2s7tt,ninjafaces,1360815030,"Yes. In common swat vernacular a ""Burner"" is a form of tear gas canisters that burn hotter then their less potent counterparts. All that a tear gas grenade is is a smoke grenade that when ignited produce a cloud of smoke laced with the gas.  http://192.139.188.71/index.asp?id1=124  Edit: the link is to a page breaking down CS grenades and for some reason wants to display IP. :/   My bet is that they used these.  Triple-Phaser™ Canister Grenades  Model 52 &amp; 62 Series  DESCRIPTION The Triple-Phaser™ is a multiple munitions canister type grenade. After launch it will separate into three submunitions, each providing a continuous discharge of smoke. The Triple-Phaser™ innovative ignition and separation design, unique to this type of grenade, provides for reliable operation and rugged construction.  The Model 52 series is a full size grenade. The Model 62 series is medium sized, having the form factor of the military M83 smoke grenade. Three choices of composition are available: CN tear agent, CS riot control agent and inert white smoke for screening and tactical purposes.  OPERATION These grenades can be thrown by hand or launched from most 12ga shotguns by using an appropriate launching adapter and launching cartridge.  SAFETY All our grenade products include a patented Fuze Safety Clip (U.S. 5,886,288) as standard equipment. The clip positively retains the pull ring, thus preventing accidental or unintentional removal. In order to remove the pin the  pull ring must be rotated clockwise a quarter turn before pulling. The pull ring can be put in and out of the safe position as many times as needed.  Video Click this link to view a Video of the CTS 5211 Grenade. This is a large 7mb wmv file.

t5_2s7tt,Toby-one,1360815349,"If I had to guess it's probably because a conspiracy story is a lot more interesting than the fact that the news system is completely broken and that it is undermining the very foundation of our democracies. I don't know how someone might fix the news but I am fairly sure that it won't involve car chases, guns, shootings, stuff burning. Therefore people are a lot more angry about the police because they **might** have done something wrong than the fact that news agencies around the world **are** wrong.    Also I think that it is easier to understand because everyone is selling this story as ""The Rambo killer™"" which is easier to understand than ""The system in which the news operate is fundamentally flawed and needs to be fixed however the government can't really touch it because that could be construed as interfering with the freedom of the press and the business of this freemarket economy can't really fix it because they are simply doing what free enterprise does best they are making a profit for their share holders which is a part of the problem.""  The solution is a lot better, dare I say, entertainment aswell:   ""*Burning cabin* Is this the end? Is it over? Can we blame the cops? Maybe...""   versus   ""Looong senate committee hearings. Maybe we have a solution? Looong debate on freedom of the press. Maybe ther is a solution just around the corner? And after a looong debate when we still don't have a simple solution and because people have the attention span of a small gerbil diagnosed with ADD everyone is now watching Jersey shore instead.""

t5_2rfxx,nothingxs,1360819764,"That's really nice of you, but all I would write is a lot of Garen VS one character or another. I've only been playing for six months and only really been taking it seriously at all for about three of them. I just get really introspective in every matchup I play. Garen is my favorite champion because I feel that, despite having a very simple kit, most of his success against a lot of good characters comes from smart decision making (fundamentals over ""flashiness"" or kit complexity). I'm a Silver-caliber player (and I have no problem admitting it) though, and it shows in my abysmally small champion selection (Garen, Teemo, Badalee™, Cho'gath, a little Olaf). I contribute just fine to Gold level games but I'm not good enough to carry myself out of Silver by myself, so until I get there, I'm stuck here.  I only really have insight about some of the matchups too, because I don't get to play a lot of matchups at ""this ELO."" Garen vs Darius, Garen vs Teemo are two matchups I really focus on. I actually really love Garen vs Kayle, because it's like a game of chicken where Kayle is winning by default until she gets antsy and pops her Q too early on you, at which point you get to spin to win.  I pick Garen early a lot in solo queue and people love to pick Teemo at me when I do, and I haven't really lost that lane yet in Silver (although I've once needed jungle assistance to win the lane; the other times it's usually me carefully watching Teemo's mana until it was low enough that a surprise flash Q would almost guarantee a kill at level 6 -- players at Silver/low Gold have depressingly poor mechanics, myself included). I also pride myself in knowing that I will be much more useful later in the game in teamfights than Teemo, and I can be a better split pusher when push comes to shove (Garen can actually split push like a beast if you buy Swifties + Zephyr as part of your build, so like Swifties, BC, Visage, Sunfire, Zephyr, IE or GA or Warmog's to taste -- try it sometime).",™

t5_2smhl,Tokkojin,1360832576,"Release Diana was a stronger Akali. For simplicity's sake though, I'll discuss the current Diana: Diana's Q is a remade, better, stronger version of Akali's Q (as it is has 830 range vs 600 range AND is AOE). Diana's W could be seen as akin to Akali's E, AND it gives Diana a shield. Diana's E and Akali's W are vastly different, as one is a soft knock-up (if that is the term) and the other provides stealth, armor, MR, and a slow, however, I would argue that the CC that Diana's E provides is much better than Akali's CC. (However, I suppose that, given Akali's playstyle, the stealth that her W is much more useful to her than Diana's E would be.) Finally, the ultimates. They're both exceptionally strong gap closers (release Diana! ♥), however, I will have to argue that Diana's is much more so. It takes one 25 / 20 / 15 seconds to spawn a new Essence Shadow to use for Akali's R, whereas if one plays it smart, one could get off a Diana ult every 10 / 9 / 8 / 7 / 6 seconds by landing Diana's Q first before going in. (I personally never go in on a target without Moonlight on them first.) If you don't buy that, Diana's R's range is also 825 in comparison to Akali's R's 800.   I'm not going to compare their passives as Diana's was meant for jungling whereas Akali's was meant for top or mid lane. This, however, does raise a striking difference between the one. Diana wasn't meant for laning, however, I find her a lot stronger in it than in the jungle, where she is outclassed by many other junglers with better clear speed and gank potential.  TL;DR Diana is a better Akali but they have different roles.  P.S. I realize I'm leaving out a lot of numbers, such as AP ratios and base damage, but it's 4am.",♥

t5_2ryez,imnotmarvin,1360853035,"Everyone in Chicago knows by now of the tragedy that likely prompted President Barack Obama's visit to the city Friday: the killing of 15-year-old honor student Hadiya Pendleton in a park last month.  We know the equally tragic reason the president will use the city as a backdrop to pitch his gun-control agenda: More than 500 people were murdered in Chicago last year, more than any other city in the nation — and more than the number of coalition troops killed in Afghanistan in 2012.  Three days before Hadiya's murder, seven people were killed in Chicago within 24 hours, the youngest a 16-year-old boy. The mother of one of those shot had already lost her three other children to gun violence.  Last year, 7-year-old Heaven Sutton was caught in a shooting and killed as she was selling candy and snow cones with her mother on the street outside her home.  In Chicago alone, more than 270 children have been killed since 2007.  The president will imply his proposed ban on ""military-style"" weapons, along with expanded background checks, will help curb the violence here in the murder capital of the United States.  But so far Obama has scarcely mentioned the one factor that lies behind Hadiya's murder and behind most of the killings in Chicago last year: gangs.  Although the president does not acknowledge the gangs' role as a major cause of the epidemic of violence, the FBI does.  The FBI estimated in 2011 that there are roughly 1.4 million active gang members in the U.S., an astonishing 40 percent increase from 2009.  These gangs, the FBI says, are responsible for ""an average of 48 percent of violent crime in most jurisdictions, and much higher in others.""  Chicago police estimate that roughly 80 percent of homicides in the city are gang-related. There are about 100,000 gang members here.  There's no avoiding the fact that black Americans especially suffer in the cycle of violence gangs help feed. Only 13 percent of the U.S. population is black, but this group accounts for half of all homicide victims nationwide. The homicide victimization rate for black males ages 18 to 24 is 19 times the national average.  But while gangs affect some populations disproportionately, they in fact show broad variation. There are Asian gangs, East African gangs, West African gangs, Caribbean gangs, Latin American gangs, Eastern European gangs and white supremacist gangs.  Hadiya's death at the hands of these groups makes her one of far too many such tragedies. A quarter of all gang-related killings in the United States strike children younger than 18.  The FBI National Gang Threat Assessment reports gangs have established ""wide-reaching drug networks; assisting in the smuggling of drugs, weapons, and illegal immigrants,"" and increasingly engage in ""alien smuggling, human trafficking, and prostitution"" as well as ""white-collar crime such as counterfeiting, identity theft, and mortgage fraud.""  In many cities, gangs work closely with Latin American drug cartels. The Department of Justice's National Drug Intelligence Center has gone so far as to call gangs ""the primary distributors of illegal drugs on the streets of the United States,"" adding that they ""readily employ violence to control and expand drug distribution activities, targeting rival gangs and dealers who neglect or refuse to pay extortion fees.""  Nearly all gang-related homicides involve guns — mostly handguns. This is where the president's political pitch runs into trouble.  The FBI reports that ""typically firearms are acquired through illegal purchases; straw purchases via surrogates or middle men, and thefts from individuals, vehicles, residences and commercial establishments."" Gangs do not bother to buy guns legally from dealers who do background checks.  This suggests new gun laws are very unlikely to stop the flow of guns to gangs, which exist by adeptly navigating the black market for drugs and, yes, weapons. Newark, N.J., Mayor Cory Booker recently said that he had reviewed the ""hundreds and hundreds"" of firearm homicides in his city since he became mayor and found only one in which the gun used was acquired legally.  The fact is, all these laws will do is make it more difficult for the law-abiding to protect themselves, while doing virtually nothing to slow the violence that is ravaging places like Chicago.  When President Obama visits Friday, let's hope we hear something more thoughtful than the usual rhetoric about expanding background checks, to which gangs never submit, and banning some weapons, which they rarely use.  Honesty about what it will really take to face gang violence is the best tribute he can offer to Hadiya Pendleton and the dozens of other children killed in Chicago each year.

t5_2rddy,cleverkid,1360870329,"I came here to say this^®   However I will add that it largely depends on your genre. As R3ckleess so eloquently pointed out, when playing a dark, progressive, techie, tribal, deep, etc.. set the intervals ( and the mixes ) are looooong and intricate and tasteful, meant to induce a literal sunconcious deep trance state. ( and subsequently an *ACTUAL* groove )    When playing hip-hop, party-rockin' mashup, Elektro-house-pop, trap etc… you are constantly slamming from one track to the next keeping the energy up and the ""whoa"" factor based largely on the crowd's familiarity to the music. Evidence of this is how people who weren't even born when Baby Got Back was released, instantly go apeshit when you drop it in a set.  ( epigenetics? )   So I posit that a corollary can be made that Fun, Gaudy, Cheesy, Familiar, High Energy music = Quick transitions and short tracks.   And conversely, Deep, Intricate, soulful, intelligent, obscure music = Long delicate intervals, mixes and tracks.   Of course there are always exceptions, like the time I played an eight bar loop of the 50 cent In the Club instrumental for over 20 minutes at the peak of it's popularity, then dropped the acapella, and the crowd shat their brains out screaming deliriously in pleasure while I sneered at them derisively.

t5_2reap,fishwack,1360873446,"I just started building my first AR a couple weeks ago. I found these two great tutorials on building an AR. The first is how to build the lower and the second is how to build the upper. These offer a couple break down of all the parts and tools you need and have nice videos showing you how to put it all together.   http://www.itstactical.com/warcom/firearms/diy-ar-15-build-introduction-parts-and-tools-required/  http://www.itstactical.com/warcom/firearms/diy-ar-15-build-upper-receiver-assembly-introduction/  From my personal experience I would suggest just trying to pick up a complete rifle at a LGS, unless you are willing to wait 4 - 6 months to find all the parts you need. I'm going to be paying around 2k to build mine because of the cost of parts right now. You can still pick up complete AR's for well under that. The BCG and lower parts kits are especially hard to find now. Most LGS's will have all the magpul stuff. If you are looking to just get the items now that will possibly be banned I would suggest getting these items first: High capacity mags, lower receiver. The lower is the registered part which is considered the weapon. Other parts, IMHO, will most likely be available after any ban.  Here is a complete list of all the parts I'm getting to build one. The prices are approximate and I have also listed the supplier.   Lower Build List Stag arms lower parts kit - 65 - BCM? KNS Non rotating pin set - 30 - Brownells Sling plate BCM receiver extension nut - 7 - BCM BCM Milspec buffer extension (buffer tube) - 40 - BCM Carbine action spring - 4.50 - BCM H Carbine Buffer - 23 - BCM Magpul MOE carbine - milspec model - 60 - magpul Magpul MOE+ grip - 24 - magpul Magpul MOE trigger guard - 12 - cabellas approx total: 275  Upper parts list BCM BFH 16"" Mid Length (Light Weight) Upper Receiver Group w/ Centurion Arms C4 12"" Handguard - 850 - BCM BCM Bolt carrier group - 225 - BCM BCM Gunfighter charging handle mod 4 (medium) - 45 - BCM Magpul XT rail panels - 10 or 20 - ? Magpul angled foregrip - 35 - magpul MBUS - MAGPUL BACKUP SIGHT - REAR GEN 2 - 58 - magpul MBUS® - MAGPUL® BACK-UP SIGHT – FRONT GEN 2 - 40 - magpie Midwest industries front sling adapter (MCTAR-TS) - approx 40 - Brownells approx total: 475  (with upper 1325)  Tools Lower receiver vice block - 10 - Cheaper than dirt? Brownells roll pin punches - 20 - Brownells Brownells roll pin holders - 50 - Brownells Stock wrench - 6 - brownells Nylon / brass hammer - 20 - brownells approx total: 106  This list was put together last week so the prices are fairly current. I am doing a mid-high end build, almost exactly the same at the tutorial. This can be done cheaper.    Good luck and have fun!",®

t5_2qpp6,tetrahydrofuran,1360920819,"Okay then. Spoilers ahead.   Initial **Aligulac predictions** predict Roro and Life to get out, but the margins are really really small.  [Game 1: Parting vs Life, BelShir Vestige](/spoiler)  Parting goes standard immortal push, Life goes for quick hydras. About 10 seconds before moving out, Parting drops down Twillight and starts his third, and moves out with what we now know is a fake-push. Parting finds Life's hydras, and retreats.  Life a-moves his hydras across the map, hits from two sides, and the front wall falls before first colossus is out. Parting uses his warp prism to kill some drones in Life's main, but Life just ""goes fucking kill™ him"". Parting tries a base-race, but mutas are out, GG.  [Game 2: Parting vs Life, Akilon Flats](/spoiler)  Pretty standard first 5 minutes, with a quick +1 for Parting. Cute micro by Parting with a stalker, and a quick 3rd off one gate. Life goes for hydras again, start knocking on Parting's gateway wall at the third, while doing a ling runby into main, killing a ton of probes. This hits before any colossus is out, again.  Life goes for mutas, again, when Parting has a colossus and zealots. GG. Seems like Life has Parting's number.  **Aligulac predictions** after this match are 83% for Life in top 2, 60% for Roro.  [Game 1: BboongBboong vs Roro, Whirlwind](/spoiler)  Cross position. Roro goes for a 10-pool, 10-gas. Bboong goes for 14-hatch. Roro drops Baneling nest ASAP, 9 drones, 12 lings. Bboong drops pool at ~17. Nice splits, but its a BO loss. GG.  A ZvZ easy enough even I could see what's going to happen.  [Game 2: BboongBboong vs Roro, Daybreak](/spoiler)  Roro goes for extractor trick. No early pools this time. Bboong goes for 15-pool, 16 hatch, 16 gas; Roro goes for Hatch-Gas-Pool. Both get speed within 5 seconds of each other. Baneling nest earlier for Roro, but not by much. Bboong adds ~14 lings, compared to Roro's 8. Roro scouts the main &amp; the lings with two of his.  A quick lair for Roro, Bboongs' is 1/2 done when Roro's finished. Roro loses a couple of lings to a baneling. Quick spire for Roro, quick 3rd for Bboong followed by a spire. Roro's 3rd is delayed a bit. It actually gets denied!  Roro's mutas are quicker, but he trades most of his mutas for only a couple of drones. Bboong is definitely ahead. Bboong goes for +1 armour, Roro for +1 attack. Bboong a-moves his mutas into Roro's main, gets all of the mutas, and kills a ton of drones, a queen. Roro's counter-runby does nothing. GG.  [Game 3: BboongBboong vs Roro, Cloud Kingdom](/spoiler)  Same builds as game 2. Testie is not as bad a nickname as AngryTestie, which he used in HoN, by the way.  Roro gets a lot of lings into Bboongs base, getting 3 drones and scouting a quick lair. Roro gets his own lair. The game evens out. Roro goes for roaches, and gets a massive hit on Bbongs lings with his bane. Bboong goes for spire tech.  Roro's 3rd is quicker. An attempt to deny from Bboong is countered by lings and roaches. Roro is getting 4 infestors out, while Bboong has 10 mutas out. Roro's attempt to deny Bboong's 3rd is shut, and Bboong has map-control for a while with the mutas, which have not been much use apart from that.  Bboong flies his muta flock into the main, fighting drones and a morphing spore, killing a bunch of drones, and losing most of the mutas to infestors. Meanwhile, Roro kills Bboong's 3rd and a big chunk of drones (~20). Looks bad for Bboong.  Some roach/roach action. Roro sneaks 2 lings into Bboongs main, gets banes, and kills a small chunk of drones. Bboong tries to re-take his 3rd, stabilising, but his army composition is a lot worse, and he's ~20 down in supply. The game slows down, both try to take their 4ths. Transition into roach-hydra-beachball on both sides, Roro has a large army advantage. Roro pretty much clears Bboong's army, meanwhile with a couple of IT drops snipes Bboong's 3rd again. GG.  **Aligulac predictions** after this match are 81% for Life in top 2, 74% for Roro.  [Game 1: Life vs Roro, Planet S](/spoiler)  Early pool for Life, vs early hatch of Roro. Roro initially holds, but loses a lot of lings, it's a bit hairy...  Roro holds, sends surplus lings into Life's base, sees speed and only one base. Roro puts down a spine and has his queens at the natural (making 3rd in main). Roro then suicides all his lings into Life's speedlings, seeing Life's nat is still building. He makes an evo/spine/warren wall. Despite losing all his lings, Roro holds comfortably.  Life goes for mutas, dropping down his 3rd as well. Roro is contained a bit by Life's lings, but manages to break the ""contain"" with first bunch of roaches. Roro gets infestation pit and tries to get a 3rd. Life's third goes down to a roach-ling push, Life kills 3 queens and gets into Roro's main. Quite a frantic exchange. Roro cancels his 3rd.  Roro's push dies by mutas, giving him enough time to get infestors and spores. Later, Roro is contained again, by Life's mutas. Both on 2 base. Roro catches 5 mutas in a fungal, while Life transitions into roach-infestor too. Life then loses all his remaining 5 mutas for an ovie.  Life's 3rd is considerably quicker than Roro's, having 5 more drones but 7 less infestors. Roro pushes out with ~40 supply larger army. Beach volleyball. Roro's flank kills Life's 3rd, while his main army trades well thanks to infestor advantage. GG.  [Game 2: Life vs Roro, Daybreak](/spoiler)  Life goes 14 gas, 14 pool, while Roro goes 15 pool. Both follow with a hatch. Life gets a quick speed. Roro starts a spine, still no gas. Roro gets a full scout with his 2 initial lings, seeing nothing he didn't know about already. Spine denies Life's scout first time, but loses a drone 2nd time around.  Life gets a quick lair. Roro goes for a warren with a bit delayed lair, losing another drone to some lings of Life. Spire for Life. +1 Ranged attack for Roro. Life picks off a queen, and gets a full scout, and starts transitioning into roaches immediatelly, getting only 9 mutas out. Infestor tech out for Roro, with all the trimmings. He saves his building 3rd, barely, while Life's third is up and unharmed.  OMIGOD A NYDUS. Life denies a lot of scouting lings and ovies, but the worm goes down. Life counterattacks, and we have a base-trade. Roro's queens lag behind, and his army gets picked away by the mutas. Roro GG's.  [Game 3: Life vs Roro, Cloud Kingdom](/spoiler)  The most interesting thing so far is Tasteless' Valentine, and Artosis being a cheapsake drinking boxed wine. Standard pool/gas/hatch openers.  Roro goes for banelings, Life for lair with no banes. Aaaaaand Life barely saves his Life, by hold position queens on ramp. Very quick spire for Life, Roro's very much behind on tech now. 2nd round of attack by Roro, boom, 29 vs 46 supply, advantage Roro.  Mutas enter stage left. No transfuses on Roro's queens, but there's spores already, Roro is very much ahead in economy and supply, and is catching up in tech fast. Roro goes for hydralisks, and is ahead on his 3rd base. Life's mutas try unsuccessfully to deny the third of Roro, the game is actually much more even now.  Baneling/Muta vs Hydra/infestor/roach, what an engagement. Roro pretty bad in hydra-splitting, losing all his hydras to the banes, and losing his 3rd to mutas, but still ahead in supply, with a sizeable infestor advantage.  Supplies are even. Life keeps harassing with his mutas, but has no hydras. Roro's 4th is a bit behind Life's. Life's play is excellent, getting actually ahead of Roro. Throwing away all his mutas to remax on roaches and some hydras. Decent engagement, with nice snipes by both sides, Life defending Roro's runby. Roro's concave reigns supreme, so Life runs into Roro's nat and main sniping queens. He also loses his pool. This is close.  Or not. Roro runs downhill into Life's concave at the 4th ramp, but doesn't matter, as 4 more of Roro's infestors join the fray. Roro has too much. Roro snipes Life's 4th, and as both players main and natural is ""empty"", so a decent eco advantage for Roro. Almost 100 supply lead for Roro.  Roro remakes his pool. With a huge concave near Life's third, attacking from the ramp below and from the side, crushes Life. GG  I guess Aligulac can really predict well.  [Game 1: Parting vs BboongBboong, Planet S](/spoiler)  Gateway opener by Parting. Core, Pylon, Nexus. Pretty cool, solid build. 5 Gates for Parting, quick Lair and warren for Bboong, with a bunch of speedlings to defend. Parting moves out with sentries, but is sidetracked by lings. Decides to turn around after killing some lings, take his 3rd. Both on 3 base. Blink for Parting, roach upgrades for Bboong.  Good defense by Parting, not losing anything vs possible attacks from two fronts, initially. Bboong wrestles his way into the natural anyway, after pushing up Parting's army into his own 3rd behind forcefields. Looking bad for Parting. GG.  Parting clearly on a tilt.  [Game 2: Parting vs BboongBboong, Akilon Flats](/spoiler)  Standard. Quick 3rd for Parting via FFE, 3 gate wall-in, same stuff as G2 Life vs Parting. Bboong overmade lings, which are completely useless right now.   Overseer scouts everything, seeing a Colossus. Parting going 4th, with 5 cannons to protect it. Throws down a stargate, while Bboong goes towards a spire, getting a lot of corruptors. Quick mothership coming. 2nd Stargate, as greater spire starts. Carriers.  4 zealots out of a prism kill spawning pool right before Adrenal Glands finish. Brood lords are out. Sentries are suicided into spines, clear tech-switch tell. Both players go for a 5th base. Parting suicides his stalkers, and denies Bboong's 5th. Bboong still doesn't seem to be aware of the air transition. Mothership is out, here we go.  Bboong attacks at Parting's 5th, with roaches. Doesn't get much done, clears most of the cannons, but doesn't scratch the nexus or many probes. A bit of a downtime, until Parting decides to get rid of everything on the ground, including colossi and the last sentry, while fungal lands on about 15 interceptors. Parting adds a ton of HT's  Attack. Good feedbacks on the infestors.  Bboong remaxes on pure infestor, twice. And loses. GG.   [Game 3: Parting vs BboongBboong, Daybreak](/spoiler)  Didn't catch the start, but looks like an immortal push, BUT, Bboong took the unusual third base by a watchtower. Lair, roach warren. Here we go.  Parting loses a rallied sentry, but saves his zealots by the warp prism. Not the best push I've seen, but still. GG.  **Aligulac predictions** are useless here - 49.6 vs 50.4%.",™

t5_2ss10,emememaker73,1360949184,"February 15, 2013 (CHICAGO) (WLS) -- Two women, one from Chicago and one from Evanston, say they are thankful to be home after a harrowing ordeal aboard the Carnival Triumph cruise ship.   The ship docked Thursday night in Mobile, Alabama.   One passenger could be seen kissing the ground after exiting the cruise.   Berry, 30, recounted the floating nightmare that is the Triumph through a phone interview.   ""Being in the middle of the ocean especially at night is terrifying,"" she said.   After the experience, Berry says she has never felt more excited to be on land.   ""My mom and I are going to take pictures of our feet as soon as we touch the ground,"" she said.   Berry, who was celebrating her birthday with her mother on aboard the ship, sent ABC7 photos of the filthy conditions.   ""What we've been sleeping on is basically sewage,"" she said. ""And they've given us these orange biohazard bags to go to the bathroom in.""   She also sent a photo of her dinner-- a plate of fruit.   She says the fruit was better than the other food alternatives on board.   ""They had burgers the other day, but people started getting sick, so I don't know if they just stopped serving the burgers altogether,"" Berry said.  With sources of power scarce, passengers say it has been a challenge keeping cell phones charged. Some resorted to makeshift signs to communicate through television.   Back in Evanston, robocalls from Carnival had been the only source of direct information for Berry's husband until he finally spoke with his wife Thursday.   ""Up until the last, I'd say, eight or so hours it's been pretty much 72 hours, roughly, of radio silence. There's been nothing,"" husband Thomas Berry said.   Also on board is Rian Tipton of Chicago's Lincoln Park neighborhood who sent us a photo of the virtual tent city where she's been sleeping.   ""I think there's a lot of questions to be answered from everybody,"" Tipton said. ""I know that, in speaking with other passengers, they've got a bunch of questions too.""

But, without sounding like too much of a snob-douche (snouche?), the quality of those two videos is pretty bad. For going to a music school, I would expect much higher fidelity material to be presented from those guys, and in a more professional manner. You talk about marketing this band like it's a serious thing, but then you give us these two music videos that are so mangled and compressed that it feels like I'm listening underwater. If you really want to get serious, at least start recording demos or singles and putting together a press-packet of material to give people.  Again, no disrespect.

I would highly recommend a 55 gallon drum at least in diameter, you may need to cut it down in height to work in your system.    The individual sumps seem excessive and the drain pipes from those back are probably too small.  Just do a combined 4"" drain pipe all the way back to swirl filter (the swirl filter should be the first thing the fish poo water goes through on it's way back through the system).  The drain does not need to be along the floor either, I'd suggest keeping it a bit off the floor so you can put it into the 55 gallon drum swirl filter about 1/3rd the way up the barrel using a Uniseal™ bulkhead replacement rubber bushing.

This item only drops in hardcore, it's only purpose is to break in the new player to the harsh realities of video games as played by Real Men™.   Two-Handed Sword base (Unique skin neccessary to make it appealing enough to try without doing proper research).  The Stats:  100-300 Damage  0.10 Attack Speed  _  %100 Increased Physical Damage  +10-30 Physical Damage  %100 Increased Attack Speed  +500 Maximum Energy Shield (Because of it didn't, no one would think it's viable to use it this early)  Chaos Innoculation  Blood Magic  Random modifiers are never applied.  _   The claymore Crymore has a 100% Drop Chance on a player's first Hardcore character between the levels of 10 to 20. Only then, and only there, for everyone.  Because there are no balance issues to consider with this item all development time can be spent on making it look as large and awesome as possible, to make sure that the lucky looter actually wants to try it before figuring out what the stats are. Herein lies the purpose of the item, it has a two-step research requirement where the new player must first figure out that the total stats have already been modified by the percentual modifiers and that the attack speed means it doesn't actually have high DPS, this is a ruse that is meant to trick the very gullible and to give a sense of false confidence to the somewhat experienced. The second part would be the two keystone modifiers that together instantly kill any player that uses a skill and thus sends you straight to Softcore.  A customized death message would appear upon dying to this weapon, where you may choose from either the Accept button or the Crymore Noob button, the later shuts down your game.

t5_2w92e,Kuldebar,1360960251,"My thoughts on the subject.  None of these things are A or B, especially since there are three factions, but it all comes down to the overall bias of a game's population that will cause the drift, once numbers reach a certain point, a fair number of players will go with the dominant/most popular choice. *A few contrarians will go for the road less traveled just to spite the masses.*  It's a tough challenge, many variables but to my mind there are some preventive things that can be done to lessen the likelihood of player number imbalances: -------------------  * **Don't make any faction too *good* or too *evil*.** It would be better all around to make all the player factions menacing and dark *-thus ""cool""* -but avoid the Spawns of Satan versus the Knights of God kinda thing. It's rather polarizing for some reason, which is even worse in a Tri-Realm™ game!.  * **Starting areas are important, glaring, or even just perceived, inequalities will disturb distribution.** If one realm is beautiful lush green hills and fields of golden wheat, another emerald forests and misty valleys and crags and the last snow, snow, snow and snow... Well, let's just say that snow blindness is bad for the eyes, and leave it at that. *(Since the backstory involves a devastated Earth, the starting areas may actually be more equal in looks: post apocalyptic.)*  * **MMO'ers are racially motivated or avoid cuteness at all costs!** Beware overly cute or joke races, it is important. Yes, WoW Gnomes have their admirers and I would never say they are unpopular, but those [Gnomes](http://www.wowgen.ic.cz/Obrazky%20wow/gnome.png) muddied the water in my opinion. Those little diversions both attract and repel players, and that will smear ""cuteness"" all over an entire faction.   * **If you have to choose, and you really should, *go gritty and visceral* in design choices.** This is related to the first bullet, but it encompasses everything in the game's world and setting. *An example:* Camelot is not full of Knights in Shining Armor, not anymore. The ranks are filled with battle-scarred Knights in [dented armor covered in splotches](http://www.esubulletin.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Henry-the-Fifth-1-COLOR-205x300.jpg) of dried rust or, *OMG, is that blood*?! Avoid the whole light versus dark staging. Besides, when light and dark go to war, you really just end up with shades of gray and blood. And, there's three factions after all, fixating on light and dark staging is going to short change someone in the mix, avoid it.  Now looking at my list, one could fairly say, ""But it's all superficial stuff, aesthetics!"" Well, sex sells, so one needs do their best to take advantage. But, more importantly, these are things that can be done unlike trying to fix a realm that's losing population because it *seems* to be losing in RvR.   First off, if it's losing population it's naturally going to be rather more difficult to turn the tide if it's losing player numbers -they go hand in hand.  However, CSE could devise an ""[Act of God](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Act_of_God)"" mechanism that would reset the war when certain factors remained static for too long. After all, the Veil between realities has been ripped open some weird crazy stuff is bound to ensue, right? All that continuing flow of energies between the origins of the opposing realms could make for one huge ass storm of biblical proportions. Storms wouldn't happen like clockwork or on a schedule, but they would tend to happen when certain not entirely understood factors came into play.  The point is, you want a continuous war, but in truth it needs to be bitter, unwinnable and really, really fun. The city captures in WAR were largely unsatisfying because they begged the question: you have just vanquished your enemy and taken over their capital city and killed their leaders   -YOU HAVE WON!. But, you really didn't did you? So, let's avoid that kind of thing. It's alright to fight over a hill or a mine or river crossing in a tug of war match, but the global HQ for a faction should be reasonably off the table. Perhaps this war is more about destroying the enemy who are trying to control limited and rare resources and less about changing political leadership; that's far too civilized, it's about outright survival and the preservation of your realm.  I am just excited about *all the potentialities* of what CU represents to me, so please if you have read my thoughts take them in the spirit they were intended: the ramblings of an aging geek. ;)  ",™

t5_2qls5,sacundim,1360976085,"Macro lens, a decent tripod and ballhead, macro focusing rail, and a camera with magnified live view.  I went for a Panasonic Micro Four Thirds camera, which can easily use lots of different vintage lenses on mount adapters; my macro lens is actually a 1970s Minolta that cost me $75!  The [macro focusing rail](http://reallyrightstuff.com/ProductDesc.aspx?code=B150-B), on the other hand, cost me a very reluctantly spent $345.  However, with the focusing rail, a camera with magnified live view and strong light, you can get very precise focus.  I'm still trying to figure out the lighting, and not happy with my results so far.  I have two crappy lighting setups:  1. Just room light, which requires long exposures.  [This photo](http://www.flickr.com/photos/26665183@N00/8475619976/in/set-72157632619231236/) was taken with room light; note the aliased escape wheel. 2. A [cheap macro LED ring light](http://www.amazon.com/NEEWER®-Macro-Ring-LED-Light/dp/B0031AQ302/), which is very harsh and frontal.  [This photo](http://www.flickr.com/photos/26665183@N00/8475621246/in/set-72157632619231236/) was shot with the LED light, and it obliterates the ""shimmer"" of the movement's wave finishing.  The video was also shot with the LED light as well; video requires the shutter speed to match the frame rate (1/50s exposure for 24 frames/second), so it needs a ton of light like the LED will put out.   Also, the ring light will reflect very obviously on large black-polished areas of a watch movement (see [this photo](http://www.flickr.com/photos/26665183@N00/8410847300/in/set-72157632350636219)), and is useless for shots through watch crystals.   One plus for the LED light however is that even when you don't use it to light the photo it's very useful for focusing and checking depth of field. Macro lenses get very, very dark when you focus close and stop down the aperture.  And I should add that all these photos have had their white balance and contrast adjusted in Lightroom.

So you need some regular cable, like the kind you have attached to the back of most desktop computers. That's called ""Category 5 UTP"" usually, or some other version that looks the same (Cat 6, STP, Ethernet, Overpriced Monster Junk ©, whatever). Cat5 is the cheap version that will work just fine.  You have 5 cameras. You need a 6 or 8 port home router (look around Amazon or your local strip-mall computer stores), so you can get the signal from all of them down the wires and into your computer. Your ""bandwidth"" (how much data is being transferred) is up to 1.3 Mbit/second per camera. That gives you a maximum of 7.5 Mbit/second, which may be a challenge if your home router was built in 1990. Anything later shouldn't have a problem.

t5_2qh1a,rosetta_stoned,1360987159,"&gt; I didn't neglect to mention anything. I already explained why I decided to upload the image on imgurl:   It's imgur, not imgurl.  &gt; I didn't think there was anything against it since the author of the infographic itself, the Linux Foundation, hosted it on yfrog.   Firstly, The Linux Foundation is Greg's employer, and secondly, Greg is one of the foundation's [featured bloggers](http://www.linux.com/news/featured-blogs). Thus, they have the right to put the blog posts he submits to them wherever they want to. You are not his employer and have no right to post anything of his anywhere.  &gt; I don't like very much yfrog while I happen to like imgurl.com more; given that it is also very popular here on reddit and it's common practice to host image there, I uploaded the image there.  I don't give a rat's arse what you like. The blog post was hosted both by the Linux Foundation and on blogpost.com. You could have linked to either quite simply. But no, you had to deny both the web traffic they earned because of your own selfish preferences. Since the Linux Foundation is Greg's employer, they have the right to move things around. You don't.  &gt; When I have to look at an image, I prefer a link to said image rather than a link to a page in website - though I recognize that in some cases this may matter to the author.   Gee, ya think?  &gt;&gt;  Except where otherwise noted, content on this site is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License.  &gt; I attributed the image (see my comment in this thread), so I am free to redistribute it. No copyright infringement. Next time get your facts straight before posting needlessly mean comments.  Facts? Hilarious. Look at the Linux.com page again, there are two things to note. 1. At the top, the word ""Exclusive"". 2. At the very bottom of the page, these words: ""Linux.com © 2012 Linux.com. All rights reserved.""  Now, what part of ""All rights reserved"" do you not understand?  As for the attribution, that is total horseshit. You are not free to rehost this thing, and copyright infringement is never excused by attribution.  &gt; I'm not interested in ""whoring"" internet points; I just wanted to share an image I found interesting.   You could have shared it without ripping off the Linux Foundation and the original author. You chose not to do that. I hope you feel proud. ",©

The farmer in every conceivable way not only knowingly attempted to use the technology that was the IP of Monsanto, he proceeded to reproduce that by isolating just those plants with the explicit purpose of avoiding paying for them.    *In 1999, Bowman also purchased commodity seed from a local grain elevator, Huey Soil Service, for a late-season planting, or “second-crop.” Because Bowman considered the second-crop to be a riskier planting, he purchased the commodity seed to avoid paying the signifi-cantly higher price for Pioneer’s Roundup Ready® seed. That same year, Bowman applied glyphosate-based herbicide to the fields in which he had planted the com-modity seeds to control weeds and to determine whether the plants would exhibit glyphosate resistance. He con-firmed that many of the plants were, indeed, resistant. In each subsequent year, from 2000 through 2007, Bowman treated his second-crop with glyphosate-based herbicide. Unlike his first-crop, Bowman saved the seed harvested from his second-crop for replanting additional second-crops in later years. He also supplemented his second-crop planting supply with periodic additional purchases of commodity seed from the grain elevator. Bowman did not attempt to hide his activities, and he candidly explained his practices with respect to his second-crop soybeans in various correspondence with Monsanto’s representatives.*  http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/images/stories/opinions-orders/10-1068.pdf  **Edit: Trolls follow me around.

t5_2qqqf,LifelongRedditor,1361013559,"Okay, so how about this. Just for a change try eating really healthy and exercising at least 3 times a week. I know it can be super fucking hard to find the time and muster up the energy to do, but maybe just try it. Like maybe for a month just to see if it's worth it. Also, the stress you are going through must be unbearable. Perhaps some stress relieving activities could really help you.  Also, what i do to avoid the negative self talk isn't to necessarily tell myself the opposite. It never feels genuine and is awkward as fuck. What i do is just not empower the thought with attention or belief. A lot of my negative self talk shit is nebulous and in that case i just fucking ignore it. And if it has a root in truth, then i simply try to not overreact and make a mental note to try and correct the behavior.   Honestly, i wouldn't downplay how traumatic your childhood was. Especially considering that you basically just said that the hurt you felt is the part of your mind you are trapped in. And also the fact that it made you suicidal. I have been suicidal since i was 7 so i can relate. How fucking shitty are our lives that as kids we were contemplating suicide, holy fuck.  If you are as smart as i think you are, then everything that you experience is heightened exponentially in the way that it affects you. Your childhood trauma and now maybe your boredom, that makes you remove yourself from society, must affect you so much. That 4 year old child was no less intelligent and sensitive then, and had even greater needs. I'm so sorry you had to go through what you did.   I wonder if you blame yourself for what happened when you were younger? Might this be why you feel you don't deserve happiness? It seems that no matter what bad shit happens to a person (especially a child) they always blame seem to blame themselves. That (often subconscious) mind fuck can last a lifetime.  I often wonder if because we are smarter and experience a deeper reality than most, if we then have more needs than others? And if so, what do we do when they are not met? Do we have more love to give? But not enough meaningful social interaction to share it with? Is our self hate a side effect of having too many needs and not enough ways to fulfill them?   There is this thing that happens to caged animals, where they develop a syndrome with the following symptoms: Examples of stereotypical behaviors include pacing, rocking, swimming in circles, excessive sleeping, self-mutilation (including feather picking and excessive grooming), and mouthing cage bars.  Perhaps we are demonstrating a higher level version of that? Instead of pecking out our feathers, we mutilate ourselves with thoughts? Perhaps instead of pacing in a cage, we pace around in our minds? This might be a lot of psychobabble, and i apologize for the Tolstoy sized novel i'm laying on you here, but if our own behavior is a sort of human, higher level parallel, then perhaps a similar cure should suffice?  The cure for these animals is more stimulation in the ways that they are lacking. So following that pattern, if we were to find more ways to find the social interaction and mental stimulation we need, then perhaps some of these behaviors and symptoms would abate?   I grew up with a lack of parental love, and it is a wound that is absolutely impossible to heal. And i know that you have the same wound. I also know the pain of having no social interaction that is even remotely interesting. I too live in this ridiculous society. So i know your life is fucking difficult, and you are a badass for not giving up.  Just please know that you do deserve happiness. You deserve to meet a bunch of awesome people that make you happy and that you will actually want to interact with.  You deserve a life where you come to terms with your difficult childhood and not let it dictate how you live.   How do i know that you deserve these things? Even though you hate yourself, you still consider yourself a good person... so it must be true.

t5_2ryd5,Scottmk4,1361043828,"&gt;Once the law is fulfilled you don't need to follow it.  And the verse plainly says that this will be after ""heaven and earth pass away"". Therefore, it must still be followed.   &gt;Your scripture is also wrong. It's from the NIV probably and is flawed.  How can you objectively show that this version is flawed and your version is right?  In any case, this edition agrees with a huge number of other translations.  &gt;New International Version (©1984) I tell you the truth, **until heaven and earth disappear**, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished.  or  &gt;New Living Translation (©2007) I tell you the truth, **until heaven and earth disappear**, not even the smallest detail of God's law will disappear until its purpose is achieved.  or  &gt;New American Standard Bible (©1995) ""For truly I say to you, **until heaven and earth pass away**, not the smallest letter or stroke shall pass from the Law until all is accomplished.  or  &gt;King James Bible (Cambridge Ed.) For verily I say unto you,** Till heaven and earth pass**, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.  or  &gt;King James 2000 Bible (©2003) For verily I say unto you, **Till heaven and earth pass away**, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.  or your preferred version:  &gt;KJV 1611 For verily I say vnto you, **Till heauen and earth passe**, one iote or one title, shall in no wise passe from the law, till all be fulfilled.

t5_2wdjo,bruccomputers,1361050730,"1. No employer match. Perhaps the biggest reason to contribute to a 401(k) is because your employer will often match a portion of your contributions. Yet, for a sizable portion of Americans, this perk just does not exist. The plans that don't come with matches may also have bad fund selections, which is another reason not to participate.  2. Really high fees. You may also want to forgo your employer’s plan because of the ridiculously high fees that some of the fund offerings charge. Sure, you defer taxes on gains in a 401(k). But the tax advantage will be quickly eroded by a 1.5 percent annual expense fee. There are many other lower cost ways to invest in a tax efficient manner, such as in an IRA or a tax efficient index fund.  3. Higher tax rates on equities. Equities held outside of retirement accounts can be taxed at the long-term capital gains rate of just 15 percent, even for people in the highest tax bracket. If you hold the same index fund inside your 401(k) you will have to pay the typically higher regular income tax rate on the money when you withdraw it.  4. A big retirement tax bill. Deferring taxes using a 401(k) simply means that you are shifting that income from now to later years. You will be required to begin withdrawing and pay taxes on this money in retirement. Having to make very large withdrawals each year could push you into a higher tax bracket, especially if you also have other sources of retirement income. In some cases, deferring taxes on too much income could hurt you.  5. Future tax increases. Between 1944 and 1945 the top tier federal tax rate was 94 percent. If you are going to be taxed at that rate again in the future, it simply makes no sense to defer your taxes now when the most you will pay is 35 percent this year. Of course, I highly doubt that a 94 percent federal tax rate is in our future since tax increases that extreme are never going to be politically popular. But it’s worth thinking about whether you expect tax rates to increase in the future.  What is the alternative? The Global Index. Supplement your retirement income. How are you funding your retirement wish list? Affording your dreams can be challenging especially these days.   Retain and reward executives in your business. Used in an executive benefits plan, you may be able to accomplish a wide variety of their business goals. Ask how you can reward and retain your key executives and help keep your company competitive and stable.  Finance your life insurance premium. Through independent financial arrangements, qualified policy-owners may borrow funds from third party financial institutions to pay life insurance premiums without necessarily having to liquidate other investments or otherwise alter other financial strategies. A premium financing arrangement can also be useful in estate and business planning for those who qualify. There are risks involved with premium financing that you should consider.

t5_2r9vp,Firegivesme,1361061403,"I just pulled this from the vaporbros webpage FAQ...   Q: Does your vaporizer have a ceramic heating element?  A: Yes! Vaporbrothers new NATURAL MINERAL™ HEATER is the first truly safe ceramic heating element approved for use in vaporizers. We use a proprietary ceramic, which gives you the ultimate in clean smooth taste and avoiding exposure to toxins. We spent 2 years working closely with a research institution to make our NATURAL MINERAL™ HEATER the cleanest possible and most reliable. You can vaporize with peace of mind knowing that all our products are factory tested and 3rd party lab verified to assure you a toxic-free experience. Other so-called “ceramic” elements on the market do not meet our standards for safety, and we recommend you give any “ceramic” heating element a critical eye. We have found other vaporizer brands using metal components in their “ceramic” heating elements, along with off-the-shelf parts intended for industry. Please be aware that you are inhaling directly off the heating element when you vaporize, so you need to be certain it was made with you in mind.   Q: What type of material is your heating element made from?  A: Our heating element is made from a dense glassy ceramic called porcelainite, which is formulated from pure clay along with other basic elements. We spent 2 years working closely with a research institution to design our NATURAL MINERAL HEATER to be clean, safe, and reliable. You can vaporize with peace of mind knowing that all our products are factory tested and 3rd party lab verified to assure you a toxic-free experience. ",™

t5_2qh1i,semvhu,1361073495,"Many moons ago, back when I was in early college, I and two friends of mine, James and Dwayne, were hanging out in our church parking lot shooting the shit in the back of Dwayne's truck. It was maybe 10 PM with just one lamp post dimly lighting the gravel parking lot. The church consisted of the main building and a kitchen hall separated by a small foyer. Behind and to the side of the church was the cemetery. Across the road in front of the church was a large pasture.  Suddenly James looks out across the road in surprise asking if we heard that. Dwayne and I looked at each other and told him we didn't hear anything. We figured he was messing with us, but James seemed intent that he heard something odd. After a couple of minutes, we dropped it and continued the conversation.  Maybe 5 minutes later, Dwayne and James both looked up across the road in shock. Dwayne asked if that was what James heard, and James said yes. I figured they both had somehow agreed to go with the joke and were messing with me. James and Dwayne said it sounded just like it was across the road just inside the pasture. They said it was kind of like a low growl or something. I kept thinking they were fucking with me and blew it off. We finally moved back to our original conversation, but they looked pretty unnerved after that.  Maybe just a few more minutes went by when I heard it too. Recalling it now makes goose bumps stand up on the nape of my neck. I've never heard anything like it before or since. This time it came from just behind the church through the foyer. The sound was like a very deep, very loud, low guttural growling laugh. Imagine what you would think a demon would sound like if it was laughing at its next kill and that's what I thought I heard through that foyer. All three of us suddenly looked toward the foyer but couldn't see anything through the pitch black. It scared us all shitless. Without saying a word, we jumped out of the back of the truck, hopped in our vehicles, and lit out like satan himself was on our asses.  We still talk about it sometimes. We don't have a clue what we heard. The only logical conclusion is that someone was fucking with us. No animal known to man would make the sound we heard. We just call it the Laughing Growling Thing™. If I never hear that sound again, it'll be too soon.  TL;DR Satan himself laughed at two friends and me in a church parking lot.",™

t5_2s8bl,Sylocat,1361081411,"[](/rarityreally) I got up at 4 AM CST after &lt;5 hrs of sleep, and spent half the day on airplanes and running between connection-flight gates before I finally arrived at my destination and got to watch the episode a few hours ago.[](/sp)  [](/twicrazy) So, this will probably be somewhat incoherent. Fair warning.[](/sp)  [](/hmmm-in) So, the showrunners had three obstacles going into this one:  1. Hasbro had ordered them to turn Twilight into a princess, because toy retailers don't like having books as accessories for girls' toys. So they had to do that while still letting the *people who actually care about the show* know that, no seriously, this isn't going to change her.  2. The shortened season meant it had to be a one-parter. Meaning they probably had to compress a two-part script down.  3. They didn't know, at the time they were making it, whether or not the show would be renewed for a fourth season. So they had to make it both a fitting potential finalé *and* a segway into a potential 4th season.  [](/twismug) Considering that their entire M.O. so far has basically consisted of ""sneak some actual constructive material onto store shelves in the guise of a girls' show,"" this didn't seem like much they couldn't handle. McCarthy already said that this wasn't going to change Twilight much at all (though of course most of the fanbase just saw the headline/thumbnail of that article and ragequit without reading). I'm tentatively looking forward to seeing the results of [this](https://twitter.com/MMeghanMcCarthy/status/302576012804366336).[](/sp)  [](/twiponder) The biggest problem was reconciling this with the ""not-every-girl-has-to-be-a-princess"" subtext. There was only so much they could do when taking this kind of order.[](/sp)  [](/takealetter) (it's a myth, however, that it's all falling apart solely because Faust left, or that the show was ever her singular unsullied creative vision).[](/sp)  [](/ppshrug) They did probably the best thing they could do with the cards they'd been dealt, by finally dropping a hint as to where Alicorns actually come from, and pitching it as a title of ascension rather than something you're born with. This also serves the purpose of presenting fanfic writers some more new worldbuilding to chew on instead of writing angstfics about how much the show was Ruined Forever™, like we usually would.  [](/raritydress) Hopefully S4 will focus more on the supporting cast rather than Twilight herself to reinforce the original ""more than one way to be a girl"" message, but also they might start doing another spin on the message: Instead of just saying, ""You don't have to be a princess,"" they could tack on, ""And if you do anyway, that doesn't mean you have to sit around doing nothing.""[](/sp)  [](/sleepyluna)[](/dashiesleep)[](/dhsleep) Okay, then, I'm finally going to take my mirtazapine.

t5_2qh0n,aim2free,1361091897,"&gt; Notice that none of the definitions of ""derive"" include how you're using it.   That what was I myself pointed out, therefore I considered that [ultra695](http://www.reddit.com/user/ultra695) was right in a way.  &gt; I think that's always considered incorrect.  What does that sentence mean?  I  do not really care about if something is ""considered"" incorrect. Words and concepts have to have a meaning. Therefore I often consider English  a terribly bad language for anyone who is logically minded. You can read my blog from Nov about my view about languages [Language, Geeks and Logic❣](http://rolandorre.se/?p=201).  Regarding  my first interpretation that is to differentiate is Δf(x)/Δx it makes a lot of sense, as to differentiate is to take the difference of something, that is a derivative or a tangent to a function you get by  lim_(Δx→0)_ (f(x)-f(x+Δx))/Δx  which gives  rise to infitesimal calculus and this principle is usually the one applied in numerical math. The logical would then be to name the result of this as something like ""difference quote"" which it is, and actually is in numerical math but which it is not when you have found tricks and rules for how to do it exact.  Now the tangent is actually denoted *derivative* and how do you reach a *derivative*, well by some action denoted e.g. *derivation* but what would be the basis (presens infinitive) form of this, well *derive* sounds like reasonable approach or possibly *derivate*.  Anyway, one has to have a way to differ between the numerical approximation form  i.e. Δf(x)/Δx  versus the exact form d f(x)/d x .  The human language is usually terribly inconsistent and ambiguous (especially English) and we often have to learn ridiculous exceptions (especially in English) instead of using simple terminology and consistent rules which we do in math, logic and programming.  Regarding the naming, it doesn't really matter actually, as in math you always express yourself with a stringent formalism, thus can not be misunderstood.  OK, with some exceptions, I have for instance Marquis de Laplace's ""A Philosophical Essay on Probabilities"" from 1796 and it is terribly hard to read, just because it doesn't contain one single mathematical formalism except a few quotients.",❣

t5_mouw,snowmanheart,1361095392,"Wow people reacted badly to that...  I think dethb0y just meant it as a cautionary word and something to think about. Yes, in history there have been some (if not numerous) examples of this mentality working out just dandy. Just think of Lincoln (just watched the movie, assuming the stuff was accurate)! But there are also many examples of it working out badly (people rigging election counts, gerrymandering, assassination of political adversaries, racial propaganda, fundamentalist religious groups painting other beliefs as evil...) that we can't just sweep under the carpet.  Even wars and violence have overturned oppressors and dictators, many times throughout history they turned out to be the Right Thing ® to do... but undeniably giving the solution of 'war and violence' to *any* group of people who want to solve a problem is risky (in fact we demonize violent people from a young age. As I think is rightfully so), as is the case with using 'fear and paranoia' to achieve a goal.  All this to say ""just because tactic X has worked in the past, and has given us good results in the long run, doesn't mean that using tactic X for every cause *anyone* wants to achieve is *necessarily* a good idea""  So is it right or is it wrong? Clearly we need to know when to use it and not take it so lightly. One needs to be very humble and try to evaluate his/her cause very well.  Now that we've reflected on the deep topic of 'necessary' evil, space is awesome, asteroids do pose a threat (the one that went over russia broke a lot of stuff and hurt people), we should totally fear monger the crap out of this :D ",®
t5_2r65t,epik,1361096268,"I've been on a rampage going through so many different wallets and money clip designs on kickstarter the last few days.  Lots of interesting stuff and cool to see everyone's personal ideas about it.  This is one of the better ones. I like that the length and width is the same size as the credit card, unlike another one with carbon fibre or aluminum where they made it larger.  I think the bottle opener aspect is just gimmicky so would probably order aluminum for the lighter weight.  I'm on the fence because I would like it to be as slim as possible. And at the moment it looks like each plate might be 3 cards thick.  I am also looking for someone who integrates either a deeper finger push slot or an open mid area so you can place your main payment card on top and slide it through scanners without needing to completely remove the card.  If he did that and managed to get the thickness down this would be pretty much perfect.  Unless there was a way to use only one metal plate and still use the bands effectively.  Thanks for sharing though.  I ordered a standard stainless money clip for $2 to hold me off until I decide on a design. Price rose to $3 now but if anyone is interested: http://www.amazon.com/SHARKK®-Silver-Stainless-Steel-Wallet/dp/B00AIY3N02/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1361096288&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=money+clip+sharkk  Update: Went through the comments and he gives the official size: 87 x 55 x 2mm - For both titanium and aluminium. Torx screw heads protrude about 0.3mm from the plates.  Credit cards have a thickness of .7mm so that is indeed approximately 3 cards for each plate. Plus the screws going .3mm out on both sides.  I'm not interested anymore but glad the ideas are constantly improving.",®

t5_2sljg,rumanchu,1361126706,"One thing that struck me while looking through a list of all of the stuff included in the WWE Libraries is that they *could* become the NFL/MLB/whatever of professional wrestling if they wanted to, with multiple sub-federations acting largely independently of each other.  (Off the top of my head, they could have RAW (basically the current WWE style of fed with some snappy acronym), ECW, and NXT as separate brands).  It will probably never happen as long as VKM is around, though, for a couple of reasons:  1) Vince seems to believe (and he's arguably correct) that the WWE brand is bigger and more important than any of the other brands, so the odds of there being a credible federation that he owns being presented as something other than WWE are next to impossible.  If there were multiple federations under some ""league"" banner, one would be called WWE, the best talent (according to VKM) would be in that federation, and the bulk of the leagues resources would be spent putting the WWE over.  IMHO, this is why the brand split never really worked (because WWE as a whole was always bigger than either Raw or Smackdown), as well as why the ECW relaunch ""failed"" (again, WWE is THE BRAND).  2) The idea of a professional wrestling ""league"" is too much like sports, too little like entertainment.  Right or wrong, WWE and Vince have spent a lot of time and effort rebranding themselves as an entertainment company rather than a wrestling promotion.  (That's why WWE has ""Superstars"" and ""Divas"" and ECW had ""Extremists"" and ""Vixens"").  3) (This is somewhat related to the first point): Vince isn't going to spend any money presenting anything that could prove his vision of how ~~professional wrestling~~ Sports Entertainment™ works.  There's not going to be a Ring of Honor or Chikara style ""federation"" funded by WWE money; there's nothing in it for VKM to present something like that.  Either the non-WWE product would rake in tons of money and prove VKM wrong (which is a risk that I don't see Vince taking) or it will ""fail"" and just prove VKM right (which means that Vince just threw money away that he could spend on putting WWE over).",™

t5_2cneq,fapingtoyourpost,1361146767,"Yes and no.  Effects on Driving: The drug manufacturer suggests that patients receiving treatment with Marinol® should be specifically warned not to drive until it is established that they are able to tolerate the drug and perform such tasks safely. Epidemiology data from road traffic arrests and fatalities indicate that after alcohol, marijuana is the most frequently detected psychoactive substance among driving populations. Marijuana has been shown to impair performance on driving simulator tasks and on open and closed driving courses for up to approximately 3 hours. Decreased car handling performance, increased reaction times, impaired time and distance estimation, inability to maintain headway, lateral travel, subjective sleepiness, motor incoordination, and impaired sustained vigilance have all been reported. **Some drivers may actually be able to improve performance for brief periods by overcompensating for self-perceived impairment.** The greater the demands placed on the driver, however, the more critical the likely impairment. Marijuana may particularly impair monotonous and prolonged driving. Decision times to evaluate situations and determine appropriate responses increase. Mixing alcohol and marijuana may dramatically produce effects greater than either drug on its own.  [Source](http://www.nhtsa.gov/People/injury/research/job185drugs/cannabis.htm)",®

Is it that hard for you to understand that there are people who get enjoyment partially through laughing at the idiotic ideas libertarians have? Is it *really* that unbelievable?  &gt;It's clear that there is a huge demand for driving whilst drunk, yet the government has forcibly monopolised all of the roads then universally banned drunk driving on them. Unsurprisingly, people tend to do it anyway. Why would the government care about drunk drivers? .... Thievery and murder necessarily violate the rights of other people. Drunk driving doesn't - it simply usually increases the risk for people. I'm sure there are people who are less likely to crash whilst drunk than some people are whilst sober.  He advocated legalizing drunk driving. Shut up and learn how to read. And I am perfectly aware of the reasoning behind his argument - ""private roads"" is a favorite topic amongst reddit libertarians. It's also completely idiotic, but there's really no point expanding on that. You'll just fall back to your Rothbard and Rand and von Mises to tell you it's all ok and that the free market™ is the catch-all answer to life. It's heartening that libertarians will never make political gains or form a coherent power-base, due to the philosophy being based on anti-organizational principles. You'll always have reddit to cry about it on, though.   I also don't see how this isn't a ""free and open"" political discussion. You're posting in it and reading it, aren't you?

t5_2u69x,Black_Penguin,1361176828,"Story Time!  I've been forcing very little these past two weeks due to exams and stuff at work. At one point I tried to enter my wonderland and couldn't, whatever I tried. I decided to go to sleep and try again the next morning. Morning came and went, and I kinda forgot, but when I went to bed it came to me again, and so I lay down, and started doing my thing.  Entering was really easy, the visualisations were vivid, when compared to what I got the last few times that I had done some effective forcing. It was awesome. But then Larissa comes along, with a really sad look on her face, and tells me to follow Her. She morphs into a bat, so I do too, and we start flying over the woods, into the mountains. Once there She veered off to a side and entered a cave, which kept going deeper and deeper. I realised why She chose the bat-form at that moment. Anything else would have been quite impractical. Anyway. So we're going deeper and deeper, in complete darkness, without any form of communication, but I got the feeling, that things were bad, and I should be prepared for Bad Things™.   Suddenly it started getting a bit brighter. We entered a cavern, and in it's centre, on a pedestal, lay a faintly glowing stone.  Larissa then made me understand, that this was what I understood to be the Heart of the Land. The brighter it shines, the better off the Land, and all it's creatures. Needless to say, I quickly realised that my wonderland was dying.  Since then I've vowed to force more, which has gotten very hard. I'm not getting the returns, I once did. I fucked up, and now my wonderland, and the marvellous creatures in it are paying the price for my laziness.  All I'm saying is this: No matter how hard it seems, no matter whether You're getting anything in return right that moment, stick with it. Don't give up. S/He's there, and waiting to be shown a path to break through to You.",™

I calculated that using the bus system would take two hours, plus the time to get to the nearest park-and-ride lot.  Transit in Charlotte is a bad joke, and the city suffers for it. Charlotte still thinks it can pave its way out of vehicular hell, despite the mountain of evidence to the contrary. Thirty years ago when the outer loop was still being planned, the city brought in a speaker from Atlanta's planning department to address the People In Charge of These Things™. He talked about the futility of continuing to add roads, and the need for useful mass transit. He ended with this: ""I'll tell you these things for certain. First, the beltway didn't solve Atlanta's problems, and it won't solve yours. Second, you'll ignore me and build it anyway."" Prescient.  It doesn't help that mass transit is stigmatized by local residents as something only poor people use (as you note), and by local politicians as socialism in action (if not in so many words). Plus, developers hate the idea, and Charlotte is nothing if not developer-friendly (why else would you build a ring road with exits every mile?).",™

t5_2r5lh,ThorinRuriksson,1361204334,"That's exactly what I mean. There is going to be some similarities here and there, a few of the very oldest symbols being common, maybe even some very basic belief structures... This is inevitable around the world. But the sort of direct evolution of theology that some people try to put forward is patently ridiculous and not supported by the evidence. In her book, Lale almost seems to imply that early Indians met early Scandinavians and mixed... Basing this off of things like the Norse pagan theories on the multipart soul or spirit against Indian reincarnation, her thoughts on our views of carrying bladed weapons against the Sikh tradition of carrying a knife etc... I'm honestly not surprised by it, however, as she seems to already have a tenuous grasp on history and anthropology. It would not terribly surprise me to speak with her and find she has a hard time separating Homo Sapians Out of Africa and the ideas of the Fertile Crescent as the Cradle of Civilization. See all those capitol letters I just used? That's probably the problem right there; people love little academic soundbites that they can use to form entirely wrong understandings of the subject matter from.   And I give no excuses for my absence, any more than I ever apologize for starting a sentence with the word 'and'. Or for my fondness for ellipses.  As for the proliferation of Wiccatru, I'm not sure 'fault' is the right word here, at least not the way you're using it. Sure, people come looking for the nuts and bolts how-to of the religion and we fail to give it to them, but should we be blamed for not giving people something we don't have? These people are searching for our Ritual™, just as they might go to the Vatican for Christian rites. But we simply don't have those sort of hard set ways of doing things. Our traditions and rituals, as you've said before yourself, were always very local. Now, that doesn't sit well with a mind born out of a 1000 years of Christianity, but unfortunately for the fresh convert we've never been a people for softening a truth for the comfort of the listener. What we can give them is the framework to create something for themselves, their family and their folk. We can give them our beliefs, we can give them our moral outlook, we can give them our attitudes towards life. We can tell them what rings true to us, and the stuff that works will stick. We can warn them off of the Wiccatru, and if they are truly the type that wants to be one of us they will avoid it like the plague as our folk tend to dislike even convenient untruths. We can tell them why there is no Ritual™ to give them and hope that they will be satisfied and willing to put in the work to deal with the lack. Quite simply, if those of us who avoided the Wiccatru snare (or fought their way out of it) can't agree on even the *need* for rituals of certain types, we can't be expected to offer how-to's at the level of Wicca. After all, they have the advantage over us on time and research material since they don't have to look back more than sixty years and at the research material written in that interval. This topic really deserves its own thread. ",™

Likewise with any information exchange between parts of such [a] system[s].  In fact, given the compression ratio, I would say that if would be possible for a conscious system to evolve or spring into existence totally spontaneously, that would be the time for it to happen. A near-infinite number of monkeys typing randomly at near-infinite speed, and all that.  Of course, it might be that conditions were such that no such system could possibly exist, though maybe one could argue that the entire collective universe itself would be such a system, or at least could be.

t5_2cneq,JF_Queeny,1361231651,"Sure.      *In 1999, Bowman also purchased commodity seed from a local grain elevator, Huey Soil Service, for a late-season planting, or “second-crop.” Because Bowman considered the second-crop to be a riskier planting, he purchased the commodity seed to avoid paying the signifi-cantly higher price for Pioneer’s Roundup Ready® seed. That same year, Bowman applied glyphosate-based herbicide to the fields in which he had planted the com-modity seeds to control weeds and to determine whether the plants would exhibit glyphosate resistance. He con-firmed that many of the plants were, indeed, resistant. In each subsequent year, from 2000 through 2007, Bowman treated his second-crop with glyphosate-based herbicide. Unlike his first-crop, Bowman saved the seed harvested from his second-crop for replanting additional second-crops in later years. He also supplemented his second-crop planting supply with periodic additional purchases of commodity seed from the grain elevator. Bowman did not attempt to hide his activities, and he candidly explained his practices with respect to his second-crop soybeans in various correspondence with Monsanto’s representatives.*  http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/images/stories/opinions-orders/10-1068.pdf ",®

t5_2cneq,JF_Queeny,1361233678,"See the actual notice on page 14.  *Monsanto sent Bowman a letter on June 11, 1999, specifically notifying Bowman of its patents covering Roundup Ready® soybeans and informing Bowman that the “[p]lanting of seed that is covered by a patent would be making the patented invention and* **using the patented invention.** *” Supp. Auth. of May 25, 2011. This letter was in the district court record attached to Bowman’s memo-randum in opposition to Monsanto’s motion for summary judgment. See Bowman, No. 07-cv-0283 (Nov. 18, 2008), ECF No. 73-2. The letter (1) identified the allegedly infringing product (Roundup Ready® soybeans), (2) en-closed a Technology Agreement identifying the patents covering the Roundup Ready® soybeans, (3) explained that Bowman would infringe the identified patents by planting any unlicensed Roundup Ready® seeds, and (4) informed Bowman that he could not pay a fee to save Roundup Ready® seeds, but may license seeds only through the purchase of new seeds subject to the Technol-ogy Agreement. Id. This letter is an “affirmative com-munication to the alleged infringer of a specific charge of infringement by a specific accused product or device,” Gart v. Logitech, Inc., 254 F.3d 1334, 1345 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (internal citation omitted), and it is “sufficiently specific to support an objective understanding that the recipient may be an infringer,” Funai Electric Co. v. Daewoo Electronics Corp., 616 F.3d 1357, 1373 (Fed. Cir. 2010).*  Then see the first portion which describes the invention.

The game ends when the the highest player in a team's hierarchy is slain  * **Pity for the doomed**: Killing minions does not provide gold (optionally, cannon creeps and jungle creeps may have gold rewards enabled)  * **In the dark**: Each player can only see their own field of view (no ward vision or allied vision is available)  * **Pick their poison**: Draft mode where the summoners pick the adjacent opposing summoner's champion instead of their own  * **Infectious**: After minions spawn, each player becomes passively ""infected"" with a random debuff. Being within vision range of an ally infects each player with the other one's debuffs. Infection can only occur at a certain distance from the spawn fountain  * **Rotation**: Every 4 minutes a ""rotation"" occurs, randomly assigning a target enemy to each player and vice-versa. Inter-champion damage only occurs between champions assigned to each other.  * **Scavengers**: Each Buff, Dragon and Baron are assigned an itemat spaw. Random can also be assigned items. The item assigned to a buff creep is only visible to the team that has control of his side of the map. When a creep with an item assigned to it dies, the item is transferred to the creep or champion that slayed it. When a champion dies, a random item from it's inventory is attributed to the creep/champion that killed it. Instead of minimap indicators, the item assigned to the buffs is visible. Lane creeps/champions/enemy buff creeps with items only show if they have anything assigned to them when within allied view. Items are more likely to be assigned to creeps near champions with less items.  * **FREE AT LAST**: All units ignore unit collision!  * **Scars of battle**: Any form of health regeneration is disabled  * **Shopping Spree**: Shop can be accessed from any map location  * **Red Pill**: Recalling is disabled  * **Surrender at 20**: If the game is not resolved by minute 20 it is declared a draw  * **[SivHD's LOCKED CAMERA SUPER HARDCORE MODE^©](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkOk3OBWDpY)**: All players have their camera locked and in max zoom throughout the match.  * **Stealthy**: Turrets dont aggro a champion if none of its allies are nearby.  * **Ut ego vivant**: Each player is given a timer at spawn, if the timer goes out, the player dies, grating a kill to the nearest enemy and an assist to all others. By killing enemy champions the time one champion has left increases in an amount equivalent to the time the champion slain had before death. (Timer deaths also grant the time increase, but only if they are not simultaneous)  * **Fountain Party**: Fountain turrets disabled.  * **Walking is the best exercise**: Blinks have their ranged reduced to 0  * **""It ain't Destiny...""**: Modifiers are randomly applied to the match",©

t5_2t7no,wadcann,1361250763,"&gt; Miguel Nicolelis, a top neuroscientist at Duke University, says computers will never replicate the human brain  I am extremely dubious of this.  Just making a human-level AGI should really be sufficient, which is an even weaker requirement.  &gt;and that the technological Singularity is “a bunch of hot air.”  That's possible.  There are [a very real set of critiques of the idea, some of which cannot simply be dismissed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity#Criticisms).  &gt; “The brain is not computable and no engineering can reproduce it,”  That's oddly-phrased.  I don't see why it wouldn't be possible to simulate the brain (though we currently have neither the ability to digitize a brain and its electrical and chemical state, and doing so is probably extremely inefficient as a way of achieving AGI).  &gt; “There are a lot of people selling the idea that you can mimic the brain with a computer.”  I'd believe that it isn't going to happen tomorrow or isn't going to happen in a hundred years, but not that it isn't ever going to happen.  &gt;But Nicolelis is in a camp that thinks that human consciousness (and if you believe in it, the soul) simply can’t be replicated in silicon. That’s because its most important features are the result of unpredictable, non-linear interactions amongst billions of cells, Nicolelis says.  Granted, his actual quote may be getting massacred by the journalist, but I have no idea why non-linear responses would be any sort of an issue for computability.  They might add to computational load, but they're no new surprise.  The [sigmoid function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_function) is non-linear and has been used as the activation function for neurons in simulated neural nets before.  ""Unpredictable"" might mean ""hard for a human to predict"", but hell, so is a galaxy of stars undergoing [n-body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-body) interactions...but we can simulate that.  If ""unpredictable"" instead means ""fundamentally impossible to predict"", I see no evidence for that.  &gt;The neuroscientist, originally from Brazil, instead thinks that humans will increasingly subsume machines (an idea, incidentally, that’s also part of Kurzweil’s predictions).  So, basically, the AI guy thinks that we will move squishy brains into computers (because Computers Are Awesome™), and the neurologist thinks that we will move computers into squishy brains (because Squishy Brains Are Awesome™)?

t5_2qmiy,Arve,1361261154,"&gt; Nothing wrong with posting a meme to express my thoughts, right?   There is.    Posting a quickmeme is a bit like speaking before the U.S. Congress in a clown suit.  It's hilarious.  Exactly once.  After that, it's an annoying, stupid and cheapens your message.  Also, for what it's worth, since I see the number of times someone clicks that ""report"" link next to a post, both this, and the previous quickmeme post have received multiple complaints from community members who don't want to see quickmemes proliferate here.  What you wrote in your reply to me expressed where you are on this issue much better, and I can move on to providing advice:  &gt; I, for one, have been swaying back and forth over whether to buy this or the RWAK100.  Don't.  This product bears all the hallmarks of being a joke. Quite probably at the buyer's expense:  1. Not a single measurement offered, but a lot of audiophile mumbo-jumbo: ""oscillators: 2 separate precision Golledge crystal oscillators"", ""DAC: modified NOS Philips 16-bit R2R with current output"", ""Oversampling: Zero"", ""gold plated contactor foil, hand assembled"" (Hand assembly is not a good thing - humans make mistakes, both small and large, that affect either product performance or product safety) 2. WAV as the only supported file format‽ Seriously‽   3. ""supports iTunes® music library structure"". No, seriously, it doesn't.  The iTunes library is a bunch of records in a flat database file, and this thing doesn't utilize or support anything iTunes-specific.  It supports sorting content by album or artist.  He even fucking requires that you transcode the files you already have to some horribly space-inefficient format, with somewhat limited metadata-support, using one of two random pieces of software.  And then, from the FAQ:  &gt; First: no worries, the software is extensively tested to work, LOL :)  Since this product pretty much seems to be a one-man project, I find that highly unlikely.  Next, there is this:  &gt; If there would be a software upgrade available in the future, the Tera-Player's software can be upgraded. In this case the unit would have to be returned to me for doing the upgrade. The reason is that right now, the Tera-Player is still the world's only pocket size player capable of reading 24/192 wav-files while having substantial playtime.   Seriously - he talks about 24/192 as if it was some particularly _hard_ thing to do, or copy?  And he talks about this, while using a fucking 16-bit DAC and no oversampling?  You have to be kidding.   Also, he doesn't say anything about precisely which DAC chip he is using,   &gt; This is realized by an all assembly programming on the ARM Cortex processor.  There is exactly _zero_ advantage to writing something as relatively trivial, and undemanding as this in assembly.  I recently stumbled on some article about [CPU requirements for decoding various audio formats](http://www.hydrogenaudio.org/forums/index.php?showtopic=92235) - on a 379 MHz ARM CPU, decoding FLAC, which is the most expensive of the tested formats, use about 6% CPU.  The only thing assembler programming buys you outside of performance-critical code (which this is not) buys you is increased complexity (e.g. probability of bugs) and lack of maintainability (e.g. harder to find the bugs) and lack of portability (should he ever need to use his decoder on a different architecture).  I also rather suspect the choice of assembler is why this thing only supports wav - wav decoding is mostly done by moving bytes around without doing much to them (apart from changing word length, so they can be used by his antiquated DAC chip)  &gt; I found out that the Koss had the biggest potential compared to all the headphones I tried  He is fucking joking, right? Please tell me this is an elaborate joke.   Don't get me wrong - the Porta Pros are good for what they are: ""My first non-terrible headphone"". That's not to say they are particularly _good_.  [Please take a moment to study the measurements](http://www.innerfidelity.com/images/KossPortaPro.pdf).  Yes, at an SPL of 90 dB, they have 10% THD in the bass, and at 100 dB, they have 40% THD. (at 20 Hz for both). Their bass is up 5 dB in the entire range. Their 30 Hz square wave response is indicative of somewhat sloppy bass.    No, its not bad for a product costing less than $40, but it's still a product costing less than $40. And no amount of mods is going to make them even halfway good headphones.  Finally, this product is made and sold from Germany - however, at least on the pictures he has shown, they bear no CE mark, which means that he isn't declaring that this product meets any relevant (safety, reliability or other) standards.  As far as my understanding goes, it is not legal to sell products in or to European countries that aren't CE marked.  Seriously: Buy something else.  Anything else. This product is ridiculous.",®

Found a better article: &gt;Undefeated eight-time world champion Floyd “Money” Mayweather, boxing’s pound-for-pound king and the highest paid athlete in the world (Forbes, 2012), has entered into a groundbreaking pay-per-view deal with Showtime Networks Inc. and its parent company, CBS Corporation. Under the new deal, SHOWTIME PPV® will collaborate with CBS Corporation to comprehensively promote Mayweather’s events on the CBS Television Network and via the corporation’s expansive media platforms. The deal-a unique revenue-sharing arrangement between SHOWTIME PPV and Mayweather-will enable him to fight up to six times over a period of 30 months, with the first mega-event taking place on May 4, 2013, when Mayweather will fight Robert “The Ghost” Guerrero. More details of this upcoming event will be announced shortly.  http://www.boxinginsider.com/headlines/floyd-mayweather-signs-record-breaking-deal-with-showtime-done-with-hbo/",®

t5_2qh96,Grickit,1361296556,"&gt;When some of your top posters and commentors have tags or usernames like ""Misandry Avenger"" or ""Princess Misandry"", you might be able to see my point. Especially when the definition of misandry uses the word ""hate"".  Misandry does not exist in the same way that misogyny does. Sexism is pervasive and oppressive. There is no historical oppression of men that those jokes perpetuate and make light of.  Unlike bullshit like ""Get back to the kitchen bitch!"" or ""teehee I meant faggot as in cigarette"" Gee. Guess why cigarettes were called ""faggots"". How did they used to murder homosexuals? Burned 'em at the stake.  Anyone who can look at the structure of power (literally ""The Man™"") throughout history and even still to this day, and come to the conclusion that men are oppressed and women hold all the power has to just hate women. What other excuse is there for for such a bullshit theory? That's the only reason I can come up with. They're just looking for a reason to hate women.  Like if we lived in fucking Amazonia with Wonder Woman, yeah jokes about misandry would be shitty as fuck. But this is Earth.  I would look up your comments, but you know what they are. So why are jokes perfectly acceptable to you when they're about oppressed groups, but suddenly some women in SRS who are fed up with sexism crack a few wises about misandry and that's just ""TOO FAR BRO!"" ?",™

t5_2sokd,aquaphire,1361301492,"A marketed drug may have up to four different types of name: a chemical name, a company name, a generic name, and a brand name.  A chemical name is given when a novel chemical entity or biological is developed. The chemical name is a scientific name based on the compound's chemical structure and is almost never used to identify the drug in a clinical or marketing situation.  A company that is developing a new drug will give it a company code to identify it within the company, which is used prior to it being designated a generic name. For example CDP870 is UCB's company code for Cimzia®.  The generic name is commonly used to identify a drug during its useful clinical lifetime. It is also known as its International Non-proprietary Name or INN. INNs facilitate the identification of pharmaceutical substances or active pharmaceutical ingredients. Each INN is a unique name that is globally recognised and is public property. An INN is designated by the World Health Organization.  The company that patents a drug usually also creates its brand name, trade name or trademark. Under trademark law this name is owned by the company which has exclusive rights to use it. Drugs are often designated with a registered trademark, for example, Cimzia®, Keppra®, Xyzal®, Xyrem® and Neupro®. A drug may have more than one brand name.

t5_2qhc8,Suntosaurus,1361307307,"NJ A3659 – Assemblyman Peter J. Barnes III (D-18), Assemblyman Gordon M. Johnson (D-37)  Summary: This bill is an attack on gun owners and sportsmen, banning many popular firearms and forcing their sale, destruction, or confiscation by the state. Pretends to ban only the .50 BMG rifle, but bans every rifle-barreled shotgun in the State (one of the most popular and widely used firearms), and many modern hunting rifles and handguns. Although the bill attempts to exempt shotguns, rifle-barreled shotguns are NOT covered by the exemption, because they do not have a smooth bore and therefore do not fit within New Jerseyâ€™s definition of â€œshotgunâ€ under 2C:39-1(n). That definition specifies that a firearm must have a smooth bore (meaning no rifling) in order to be considered a shotgun. This legislation would also ban numerous rifles and handguns (see detailed list at the end of this document for particulars). This legislation contains no grandfathering; if it passes, gun owners will be under threat of criminal prosecution and incarceration if they do not sell, destroy, or turn these firearms in to the State in a forced buyback within one year. As for the .50 BMG rifle itself, it is not a threat to public safety because it is not used by criminals. With price tags as high as $10,000, they are exorbitantly expensive, large, heavy, difficult to conceal, and their military ammunition is already illegal in New Jersey. They are owned by professionals like doctors and lawyers who are able to afford them, who use them for matches, competition, and precision target shooting. Banning them will not impact crime or prevent another tragedy. This legislation has no impact on crime, school safety, or mental health.",™

I highly doubt that putting out a rushed, poorly explained, and honestly tacky episode was ""part of Lauren's plan"".  Also, none of the other characters have had their destinies fulfilled.  I'm guessing that what Lauren had in mind was that the main six each get what they've wanted one by one and have to leave Ponyville/one another.  This leaves Twilight still in Ponyville and wondering about her own destiny- will she simply remain a student forever?

t5_2qhjq,actionscripted,1361322047,"This might seem snarky or or counter intuitive, but I would go with a well-known/popular CMS like WordPress. Instead of a single Rockstar™ developer rolling their own bullet-proof CMS (which it probably isn't) you have a team of thousands of collective developers and contributors working to secure a common system.  I think as far as securing sensitive data goes it's more about the backend configuration and setup than anything. You could host a secure WP site on a hardened GNU/Linux server using some of my suggestions above and a few other, more paranoid settings. The biggest threats in my opinion would be out-of-date installs and plugins. PHP has been a great, universally-available language on most web hosts but that also means you might have people with fantastic ideas piecing together insecure code and releasing it to WP admins who install it as a plugin without even considering the ramifications of extending their codebase to unknown contributors.  If you really need a secure site and don't quite trust your fingers, find someone (or a community!) who can help. I'm all for DIY, but sometimes there's simply too much to learn/consider -- and not enough of it connected -- and getting an outside expert to supplement your own skills means fewer problems down the road.",™

t5_2sokd,ZebZ,1361323625,"&gt; I think I know how numbers work, like 8 is 1000, but how would you make 80 and other numbers with multiple digits?  You just keep iterating ones and zeroes.  0 = 0   1 = 1   2 = 10   3 = 11   4 = 100   5 = 101   6 = 110   7 = 111   8 = 1000   9 = 1001   10 = 1010   11 = 1011   12 = 1100   13 = 1101   14 = 1110   15 = 1111   16 = 10000   etc, etc  &gt; In this gif, the letter ""W"" is made up of 01010111. How is this determined?  Letters get assigned through [ASCII](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII) conventions, made up of 7 bits, representing 128 possible letters, numbers, symbols, and control characters (like tab, line break, etc.). The first 32 characters are [control characters](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#ASCII_control_characters), and the remaining are printable characters.  For instance, the ""backspace"" functionality is character number 8 (or 000 1000) and ""A"" is represented by the number 65 (or 100 0001).  [You can see the full table here.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#ASCII_printable_characters)  As computing capability increased, the ASCII set added another bit, which allowed for another 128 ""upper ASCII characters like the registered trademark symbol (®) and the paragraph mark (¶).  Eventually another system called Unicode came along and expanded everything up to a total of 32 possible bytes per character. ",®

Instead of pretending he's the standard bearer of that, he could have just called Micah a liberal (which he is.)  The two things he spent the most time on, elitism and social action, were poor arguments and I noted that.  But Peter shows there is seriousness to what he's doing.  He keeps mentioning Tillich, and I don't care for Tillich's ideas, so there's that.    It's certainly the case that God can be used as an instrument or tool and that this is idolatry.  Augustine says as much.  And I get why he would be read in prisons.  I also don't doubt that he could be reading Zizek and Caputo in conflict zones and thinking about this stuff.  I'm conceding a lot of ground here.  But I still don't see this catching on with my homeless friends, so it still seems like the way the message is packaged it flies elsewhere.

t5_2qh7j,mk2ja,1361328308,"I haven't deployed yet, but I've gotten pretty good at finding ways to stay comfortable during a week in the field for a training evolution.  What will the weather be like where you will be? That's a huge factor in your planning.  COLD: Dress to be ""comfortably cool"" during movement and only wear additional warming layers once you've stopped for a while. You CAN go down as a heat case in the dead of winter if you try to wear warming layers while you're moving—you'll overheat.  If you are using issued sleeping systems, [like this](http://usmilitary.about.com/library/milinfo/marinefacts/blmsb.htm), be aware that they work better if you take off your cammies and wear just your skivvies; it helps distribute your body heat throughout the bag more uniformly so your feet don't freeze. But you have to balance that against the threat of being awakened suddenly by an attack or an instructor and needing to get dressed FAST.  Take hand-warmers. I used to put one of [these](http://www.amazon.com/28-Pair-HotHands-Hand-Warmers/dp/B0049JKQT8/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1361326333&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=hot+hands) in each glove and one of [these](http://www.vetdepot.com/heatmax-hothands-adhesive-body-warmer.html) on the inside of my thigh, as close I could get it to the femoral artery—warming the blood warms the body faster than just warming the flesh. You can also toss a couple into your sleeping system to add extra heat.  HOT: Hydrate or die. But if you drink water all day and never eat, you will still go down as a heat case. Alternate between drinking pure water and something with electrolytes (the Gatorade powder aforementioned would be great). Don't forget to snack, either. You MUST eat as well as hydrate when it is hot.  ""Chow is continuous in the field."" If you're on a patrol, have a snack open in your cargo pocket so that you can reach down with one hand now and then to pull out a cracker or a cookie or a tootsie roll and keep munching. Buy extra snacks that you actually like to supplement what you are issued. Clif bars are good. So are PayDays and Snickers. Jerky is popular. Many people like sunflower seeds and would tuck it in their lip like tobacco dip, suck the salt, then eat the seed and spit the shell, one at a time; I preferred to do that with shelled pistachios because they lasted longer and I was more excited to eat a nut than a tiny sunflower seed.  If you take off your boots before you go to sleep—which I recommend: if it is cold, having boots off keeps them warmer in the sleeping system; if it is warm, it gives them a chance to dry out—be sure you think of a way to make sure nothing crawls into them overnight. I used to put my sock over the top of the boot.  WET: Got to, got to, got to, got to keep your spare socks dry! Cammies will dry; skivvy shirts will dry; socks won't. You might be issued a waterproof (WP, or ""willie pete"") bag. If not, you can [buy one](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0009RNVPA?tag=wwwgalttechco-20&amp;camp=213381&amp;creative=390973&amp;linkCode=as4&amp;creativeASIN=B0009RNVPA&amp;adid=0V1TNYBQK6MWMYX66ZNY&amp;&amp;ref-refURL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.galttech.com%2Fresearch%2Fsports%2Fbest-waterproof-bags.php) for your socks (this also doubles as a great pillow). For the love of all things military, don't get a bright color: keep it tactical (black, green, coyote brown, or similar).  If it is going to be raining—like, no kidding, you're going to be soaked raining—the ""waterproof"" socks [like these](http://www.amazon.com/Seal-Skinz-All-Season-Socks/dp/B0012M3N3G/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1361327157&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=waterproof+socks) aren't a bad idea. They go UNDER your regular socks (or instead of them), but NOT over. That way, you can still take off the wet socks and put on dry ones, and the top of your wool sock won't draw moisture beneath the waterproof sock onto your skin.  Have [Moleskin](http://www.drscholls.com/drscholls/products/MoleskinPlusPadding.jspa) with you for treating blisters and hot spots. Don't cover the wound with moleskin if you can avoid it: instead, it is better to cut a hole in a section of the moleskin the size of the wound—this lets the moleskin around the wound take the pressure from your boot, and it reduces friction on the affected area itself.  Take a travel size of foot/baby powder and apply it to your feet and boots whether you have a wound or not. It can prevent one from developing.  Wear [sock liners](http://www.brms.com/smartwool-hiking-liner?utm_source=bing&amp;utm_medium=versafeed&amp;utm_term=0282360101&amp;utm_content=smartwool+hiking+liner+sock&amp;utm_campaign=apparel+accessories+clothing+underwear+socks) under your socks.  Modern wool socks are comfortable, not itchy, and great at wicking moisture away from your feet. I personally have had good experience with SmartWool and most of my field socks are [like this](http://www.smartwool.com/mens/socks-2/hike-medium-crew-123581.html). However, if it is colder and drier, I have had great experience with Thorlos [like this](http://www.gobros.com/thorlo-combat-boot-socks-coyote-brown-mcb.html#.TxY0Pph9nzI).  Don't bother with your usual boxers/briefs; take compression-type shorts for use as underwear so they can help prevent chafing. Here's [an example](http://www.underarmour.com/shop/us/en/Men’s%20HeatGear®%20Compression%20Printed%207”%20Shortsmens-heatgear-compression-printed-7-inch-shorts/pid1235630-004). Keep them long enough that even if they manage to ride up, they still protect your thighs.  Keep your combat gloves on. They protect your hands from all kinds of cuts and scrapes whether from carrying/manipulating your weapon or making you way through the terrain or digging a fighting hole.  Take baby wipes. Use them for the same reason parents of babies use them. For just 4 days, you don't have to take the whole package, but if you do, you can share them. But heck, if they feed you MREs, there's a good chance you won't even need to ""go"" until you get back anyway. If you want to try to avoid taking a field dump, don't eat the gum that comes in an MRE—it is a laxative. If you DO want to get something out of you, chew the gum a minute or two, then swallow it. I also would keep a small ""field dump kit"" on my person at all times in case of emergency; it contained enough TP for wiping and a few wet wipes for my hands. The travel size hand sanitizer is great to have on you, too.  Well, that's gotta be enough to help you out. There's a lot of stuff you just learn by doing and only so much of it can just be passed word-of-mouth.  Have fun!",®

These components include support for USB 2.0 devices, among others. More information may be found on the “Downloads” page of the VirtualBox wiki, at http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads.

t5_2to85,wmansir,1361331828,"You are right in the fact that it was the faultless aspect of the Mary-Sue that the email author was referring to, but I'm not sure I agree about the ""becoming too loving of their character"" part. The term's definition has become fuzzy over time, but to me the core of the Mary-Sue is author self-insertion and wish-fulfillment, which often results in an over-idealized character.  Some apply the term more broadly to all over-idealized characters, which is a very common literary problem, but, in my opinion, if you remove the aspect of author self-insertion then you remove the unique flavor that makes a Mary Sue a Mary-Sue.   Here is the story which originated the term and illustrates it via parody of a young female written fanfic:   A Trekkie's Tale  ""Gee, golly, gosh, gloriosky,"" thought Mary Sue as she stepped on the bridge of the  Enterprise. ""Here I am, the  youngest lieutenant in the fleet—only fifteen and a half years old.""   Captain Kirk came up to her. ""Oh, Lieutenant, I love you madly. Will you come to bed with me?""  ""Captain! I'm not that kind of girl!""  ""You're right. And I respect you for it. Here, take over the ship for a minute while I go for some coffee for us.""  Mr. Spock came onto the bridge. ""What are you doing in the Command Seat, Lieutenant?""  ""The captain told me to.""  ""Flawlessly logical. I admire your mind.""  Captain Kirk, Mr. Spock, Dr. McCoy, and Mr. Scott beamed down with Lt. Mary Sue to Rigel XXXVII. They were  attacked by green androids and thrown into prison. In a moment of weakness, Lt. Mary Sue revealed to Mr. Spock that she,  too, was half Vulcan. Recovering quickly, she sprung the lock with her hairpin and they all got away back to the ship.  But back on board, Dr. McCoy said Lt. Mary Sue found out that the men who had beamed down were seriously  stricken by the jumping cold robbies, Mary Sue less so. While the four officers languished in Sick Bay, Lt. Mary Sue ran the  ship, and ran it so well she received the Nobel Peace Prize, the Vulcan Order of Gallantry, and the Tralfamadorian Order of  Good Guyhood.  However the disease finally got to her and she fell fatally ill. In the Sick Bay as she breathed her last, she was  surrounded by Captain Kirk, Mr. Spock, Dr. McCoy, and Mr. Scott, all weeping unashamedly at the loss of her beautiful  youth and youthful beauty, intelligence, capability, and all around niceness. Even to this day her birthday is a national  holiday on the Enterprise.   ""A Trekkie's Tale"" appeared in Menagerie 2,  © Paula Smith, 1973 ",©

Aside from its role as a bulker, maltodextrin is often used to absorb an oil or high-fat emulsion and turn it into a stable powder. It may be that they're using it to turn oil and liquid flavours into a powder to dredge the nuts in; since your hickory flavour is already a powder, you wouldn't need to do that (though I'm not sure how you plan to make the spices stick).   Otherwise, it behaves a lot like sugar for many purposes, thickening liquids into a syrup that coats, clings, and binds food. If that's what it's being used for, a small amount of sugar would do the same trick, though it would make for a sweeter flavour. Pure dextrose powder is less sweet than sucrose and usually easier to find than maltodextrin, so it would be a good substitute in that case. Blackstrap molasses would be even easier to find and would complement barbecue flavours well.",®

t5_2qhk3,Piroko,1361366001,"&gt; I don't think feminism has gotten to the no return point yet  It almost seems like you've got an irrational attachment to the word itself more then the ideology.  You've already acknowledged that the ideology behind the word is compromised.  But you haven't followed through in abandoning the label.  The ideology you endorse is **egalitarianism**.   Feminism may be a catchy word; it was very marketable.  But marketability and catchyness have ABSOLUTELY NO RELEVANCE in enlightened discourse.  That's why so many words you see in men's rights conversations are loan words from French, or acronyms, or quotes in Latin, because they're technically and intellectually precise.  Egalitarian in French literally means a person who supports equality for all people.  Feminism™ as a word is a big fuzzy blob that is universally marketable to women, but has all the characteristics of a trademark.  ""Woman-ism"" is too broad a term to really mean anything, so it's only use is as a label for a movement.  If the movement underneath the label is compromised with misandry then so is the label. ",™

Secondly, displaying the Union Flag above the term *British Isles* is entirely misleading and just exacerbates the common misconception that it's a political rather than geographical entity. It's a perfect example of why the Irish state [does not recognise](http://www.oireachtas-debates.gov.ie/D/0606/D.0606.200509280360.html) the term nor is it used in the Irish education system, [case in point](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-408224/Atlas-wipe-British-Isles-map.html#axzz2KXTu9ZrM).  You ask why some Irish people are sensitive about this. Well, you would be too if every other map of your country posted here in /r/mapporn was mislabeled or missing altogether. It can get very tiresome correcting people all the time, but sure at least they are learning something new. :)  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Names_of_the_Irish_state  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Isles_naming_dispute    ",✔

t5_2ve1u,rds4,1361377817,"&gt;""Men become assholes because women complain when men are assholes""  SRS is not women it's mostly men who are mentally fucked up. SRS can't be described as ""complaining about assholes"", and TRP isn't about becoming assholes it's about learning how the game works and playing it the way that's best for yourself instead of the way society wants you to.  As long as the unhealthy combination of natural female behavior, traditional male roles and feminist theory that lead to our culture and laws was implicit and hidden, few people realized there's something wrong, they accepted that this absurd state of affairs is just the way it is.  SRS' (and groups' like it) trigger-happiness, attacking everybody for the slightest disagreement with their ideology, has made people think about what exactly the problem is, and they've come to very different conclusions than SRS wants them to.  &gt;TRP is nothing more than the death rattles of Real Men™.  that's funny, but no. TRP will continue to gain traction and quickly replace our mangina culture, and hopefully force feminists to start caring about proper equality.  Check for example how - in articles or tv discussions - older feminists try to soften the nice-guy-bashing that young women are so into. The young ones don't even know why they hate manginas so much they have to make up all kinds of nonsense to excuse it, TRP knows why but it's not what they want to hear. And the older feminists are worried that something's gone wrong with the big project, since nice guys are the product of feminist theory, and now young women want ""Real Men^TM"" but can't even admit it to themselves.",™

The difference in appearance between dull and shiny is due to the foil  manufacturing process. In the final rolling step, two layers of foil are passed through the rolling mill at the same  time. The side coming in contact with the mill's highly polished steel rollers becomes shiny. The other side, not  coming in contact with the heavy rollers, comes out with a dull or matte finish.

A good benchmark for killing Merville is 46-48 minutes, if you hit that mark then progress to Western Forest, AOEing mobs behind you. If you beat her with 9minutes or less left, then just farm The Forest until the one hour is up.  ---  Sorry my notes are kinda brief/rough, I wrote them for myself but may as well share them here. When I said ""do a lap"" = reset the instance, run it backwards, then reset it and run it forwards.    Some people do the Medicine Chest before doing the glyphs/ledge waypoint, I don't really think this saves much time and I find it safer to be level 4/5 instead of level 2. It's up to you though, give it a try.  I'd recommend doing a few practice runs before the race starts, it's good to know EXACTLY what your build is, and also what you want to pick as quest rewards. If you spend 1-2 minutes in town messing around with skill gems then it could cost you hitting the next level reward bracket.  For itemisation, spend Transmute/Alteration/Augments/Alchs on weapons and boots only. For longer races you should spend them on other items once you have sorted out your weapon/boots. For boots you want movement speed, and for a weapon you want +1 level to gems and more damage.  ---  I play the cookie-cutter Poison Arrow/Fire Trap Shadow, [here's my 1-2hour skill tree.](http://www.pathofexile.com/passive-skill-tree/AAAAAgYBD6sRLx4aJpUqWzZ7STtTNVVLYeJtbG17cn5yu4fbiGuZmrVItvfLQdIZ1tHjhOd062Pw2f-T). I'll change class and build at a later point once I have time, too many people play Shadow.  I use Freesing Pulse to progress to Ledge and to do the Medicine Chest, then when I relog to get back to town I pick up Fire Trap (from Medicine Chest) and Poison Arrow (from the Glyphs). I try to roll damage/+1 skill gem on a Short Bow as soon as possible.  Oh another quick tip: set ""force move"" to your middle mouse button, this can save you sometimes escaping from mobs. Also, when you create your character before the race starts, relog and you wont be laying on the beach anymore, you'll be stood up and save yourself 3 seconds ;D  I'm kinda rambling at this point, I have more to say I guess but I'll stop here, if you have any questions then feel free to ask.

t5_2qhq6,RamsesFantor,1361386773,"There are hundreds of Universities in China doing research based on Chinese Traditional Medicine. Like the bear bile link above, the medical veracity of many of these treatments is being verified.   I'm afraid you have a misunderstanding about what alternative medicine is. It isn't some head in the sand psudeoscience. Alternative medicine is based on empirical evidence, thousands of years of it, yes, but it is a modern practice and a modern discipline employing thousands of active researchers and doctors. Real doctors. pHD and MD types. Look up an interesting treatment on PubMed and in most cases you'll find hundreds of studies showing the healing factors of these treatments. The question isn't about whether these treatments work. In most cases, we KNOW they work.   But there is a schism between ""medicine,"" as you call it, and ""alternative"" or ""eastern"" medicine, due to regulation of ""proper"" medical treatment. In America, ""medicine"" is a for profit endeavor, so treatments that are not profitable are not invested in, large scale trials aren't completed, and FDA approval isn't gained. That doesn't mean that a treatment doesn't work. It just means that no one had 900 million dollars to spend on the series of large scale clinical trials to bring a plant to market.    Further, there is a lot of variability in many alternative medicines. Preparation of herbal medicines, for instance, affect their efficacy, as does the climate the plant was grown in, when it was harvested, etc... Other's have a homeopathic levels of carcinogens, yet are banned or strongly dissuaded by modern medical practices.   There is obviously a place for ""medicine"" in the world, but we don't need to be so dogmatically opposed to other philosophical avenues of healing, that we completely discredit them, and cant be bothered to understand them. That paints us into a corner and limits our knowledge, and if what we really care about is increasing our knowledge and our ability to heal, we should look deeper into alternative treatment types.    Here's an abstract from the first page of a PubMed query on Chinese Traditional Medicine  ""This paper demonstrates that in the treatment of psychiatric disorders, there are striking similarities between the mechanisms of psychoactive agents used in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and those of western psychopharmacology. While western researchers search for new treatments and novel mechanisms of action, investigators in Asia are analyzing traditional remedies in order to understand the mechanisms responsible for their effectiveness. A review of contemporary pharmacologic studies of agents used in TCM for psychiatric indications reveals that virtually all of the active principles of drug action established in 20th century psychopharmacology were encountered empirically in Chinese herbal medicine over the past 2000 years. Building bridges between these two traditions may thus be of benefit to both cultures. In addition to providing western patients with a wider selection of treatment options, the effort may help Asian clinicians and researchers avoid some of the errors that have troubled their western counterparts.

t5_2qhqx,holigen,1361390956,"I think it depends on the environment in which you use vim. Are you often working on servers where you only have transient access? If so, relying on anything to be customised for you is asking for trouble.  Otherwise, I don't see the harm in writing or using plugins or in heavily modifying a vim configuration. No one is asking the author to use anyone else's setup but his or her own. However, when the author implies that those who run a heavily modified setup lack Real Vim Wisdom™, it comes across as condescending -- as if the author is a Real Vim™ master whereas everyone else who manages to get things done with vim are hacks, or something.  There's a case to be made that the default settings in vim are painful -- why it continues to force almost all `vimrc`s to have a `set backspace=indent,eol,start` is beyond me, for example. I don't think the author is rallying against those kinds of [sensible defaults](https://github.com/tpope/vim-sensible), but it's hard to tell. His or her argument is general and vague and comes across as arrogant.  I happen to enjoy using a pleasing [`colorscheme`](https://github.com/w0ng/vim-hybrid) in a 256 color terminal and having the option to use [seek](https://github.com/goldfeld/vim-seek) or [EasyMotion](https://github.com/Lokaltog/vim-easymotion) to jump around files.  If, for some reason, you don't like the way that vim makes you navigate files or open new ones for editing, it gives you the flexibility to add new functionality that might make more sense to you. For instance, marks are terribly difficult for me to use -- I'm much happier using even search than I am having to remember which mark is used for what. I don't, however, disparage anyone else for using marks extensively, which the author seems to do for people who use heavily modified vim setups.",™

t5_2qio8,LunaSaint,1361392664,"Started in Wrath, with its beautiful whack-a-mole, and solving AoE damage with sheer brute force single target healing. It felt incredibly empowering, being able to fully heal one guy and beacon the tank with a 1.1s cast.  My love affair with holy has always been the fact that your heals are direct, single target, and meaty. You get exactly what you pay for, none of these silly hots that someone else will snipe, and no ""smart heals"" to do your job for you.  Cataclysm was a great eye-opener though. I was having to use cooldowns on every trash pack during the first week of heroics, and that was exciting. Cata also introduced the Divine Favour we see today, a sexual cooldown that I'll never stop loving. ♥  T11 Heroic delivered too, being punishing enough to force me to really plan and program myself to heal more methodically.  The Holy Power system isn't something I've been too fond of, restricting you to holy shock on cooldown. Especially in Cata, where Light of Dawn was much better than WoG. Overall though, from 4.0 to 4.2 I was very happy about the state of holy.  Then 4.3 hit, and then Holy Radiance took on its abominable form. A player targetted, AoE HoT. At least it didn't jump to other players or have an ~8 second cooldown. I'd hate the spell a lot less if it had a targetting reticule like Light's Hammer - but as it is, it's an ugly spell and against the class's nature.  Thankfully, I'd taken a break at the end of firelands (we'd picked up a *really* weak warrior tank and couldn't get rid of him) and when I came back, a spot was open for my mage instead. So I dps'd through that awful tier.  Finally, in Mists, we've come back to an era a bit more like 4.0. Boundless Conviction makes the Holy Power system much more tolerable (though we're *still* shocking on cooldown - even worse with the T14 4set). I can pool up Eternal Flames and provide a little burst. Even better, it helps you fish for Divine Purpose procs.  The best thing is WoG/EF are usually a good deal stronger than LoD, so I don't have to deal with those yucky smart heals. I wish Blizzard would do something about Holy Radiance, but as I'm currently in a 10-man guild, its use is limited anyway.  The sad thing about mists is the heroics. I used to love doing random dungeons, but the 5mans are so undertuned that there's no joy at all in pugging right now.  In addition, normal mode raids are really terrible. There's long periods of very little damage, with the occasional big spike. It's bad enough that I frequently doze off and end up poorly prepared for a big spike.  Whoops, ranty.  TL:DR  Wrath was really liberating and empowering, being overpowered as hell and stomping ICC heroic. Early Cata actually taught me how to heal. Holy Power sucks, Divine Favour is the best cooldown ever. Late Cata undid all that with Dragon Soul nerfs and stupidity of Holy Radiance. Mists improved holy power, but the normal mode content is really lacking from a healer PoV.",♥

Didn't matter though, most of the time he'd fail to kill the birdie before we needed to stack up behind the meteors. &gt;.&lt;  Either way, echoing you here. Old Holy Radiance (especially with SoL) was beautiful, much better than ugly thing it is now.  I would like to point out that HR is still very powerful and efficient, just not another glorious cooldown to go with our list of amazing cooldowns.  I've been using GoAK as my tranquility these days. Turns your next 5 spells into lay on hands and leaves you hasted up for a few seconds. ♥♥♥",♥

t5_2qjof,PaginaDentata,1361410168,"&gt;Adopting a pit bull when you have other dogs and a 4 year old toddler. What to look for?   Another breed of dog.  Seriously. This isn't a ""pit bull hate"" thing, it's common sense.  You want a dog that will get along with two other dogs who, judging by your description, probably cannot or will not defend themselves against a pit bull attack. You aren't looking to take a chance, you want a dog that *will* get along with other dogs...but pit bulls are *typically* dog-aggressive. It boggles my mind that no one has pointed [this well-known fact](http://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17vjdv/can_you_recommend_a_family_dog_that_is_highly/c89fstq) out to you yet.   Just as I would *never* recommend collies or German shepherds to people who don't like nippy dogs or clumps of dog hair on every damn thing they own, I *never* recommend pit bulls for multi-dog households. While some pit bulls live peacefully with other animals, a significant portion are seriously, incurably aggressive toward other dogs. So much so, that pit bulls often have to be [""crated and rotated""](http://www.pbrc.net/rotate.html) because they can't live together without trying to kill one another.  What's more, a number of pit bulls have passed ""temperament tests"" or even been fine with other dogs for years before launching a serious, unprovoked attack on another animal. You can't tell, just by looking at a dog, whether or not he or she is affected by this problem. You sometimes can't tell even with a temperament test or years of observation. Why take the chance?  Secondly, you have at least one young child who will not be capable of defending himself or behaving maturely around your dog for several years. [Pit bulls were responsible for two-thirds of all severe and deadly attacks in 2012, and about half of those attacks maimed or killed children. In a thirty-year period ending in 2011, pit bulls accounted for 60% of all serious attacks and just under half of all deadly attacks.](http://www.dogsbite.org/dog-bite-statistics-study-dog-attacks-and-maimings-merritt-clifton.php)  I'm sure /r/pitbulls doesn't like hearing that. But frankly, it hasn't been established by *anyone* that this data is bullshit. So why take the chance when you can rescue a small breed, or even one of several large breeds (e.g., labradors) that, despite high numbers and extraordinary popularity, rarely end up implicated in a serious or deadly attack?   Hell, you can assume that a whopping 90% of those pit bull accounts ""don't count"" for some reason, and they'd still account for twice as many serious attacks and *four times* as many deadly attacks as Labradors and golden retrievers *combined.*  Why does your husband want a pit bull, specifically? You two need to unpack that one, together. In my experience, people who go specifically for a pit bull often have one of three motivations: 1) They want a ""manlier"" type of dog (which is an irrational, idiotic reason for choosing a particular breed). 2) They want those extra karma points from other people for adopting a ""poor, misunderstood"" breed. 3: They've been taken in by the pit bull lobby's mostly-fictional America's Nanny Dog™ propaganda.  Pit bulls are a match for some owners. I have good friends with pit bulls. But for you and your situation? I see several big red flags.",™

t5_2soy6,ryhntyntyn,1361444046,"&gt;Could you elaborate on what you mean by vertical/horizontal?  Of course. In a vertical morality structure, the units in question, people, are stacked. So to take Catholicism, there's the kids, the parents, the priest, the hierarchy, the Pope, and then God. Every unit save the top has someone above it. Or in a general religious structure, people, priest, God. It looks like this and the structure shows the flow of authority goes down and obedience is supposed to go up.    God   ↓ ↑  Priest   ↓ ↑  People   In a horizontal morality structure, there is no recognized moral authority above the level of the individual. So there's only    People ↔ People ↔ People   in such a system there is no flow of control or authority except that they are all equals, so there are consequences with respect to whether others will tolerate you, but there's no authority above the level of the individual.

t5_2r9vp,Nougat,1361454542,"&gt; What's odd is that the company that makes this has a registered trademark for their company name or at least it appears they do since they're using that ® symbol. I say it's odd because they want to protect their own name, but don't mind riding the coat tails of another name.  No, people add the ® because they think it looks better, without considering that appending that symbol actually means something. You even said yourself that USPTO would deny registering this trademark, so it can't be an actual registered trademark. By using the ®, they're *claiming* a registered trademark where none exists.

t5_2qj8f,Derpese_Simplex,1361459341,"First I would like to thank you for your systematic replay.  It was appreciated.  I think to a certain extent I was a little unclear with certain aspects of why I have the concerns that I do with regards to things like nootropics.  Lets take a prominent nootropic brand ""Alpha brain"" by ""Onnit.""  This brand is regularly promoted by Joe Rogan on his podcast.  You can find the [website for the product here](https://www.onnit.com/alphabrain/#overview).  I will admit that he has a very snazzy website (not a criticism, he just has good web developers) but at the end of every claim you will see this ✝ symbol which corresponds to this statement at the very bottom of the webpage ""✝ This statement has not been evaluated by the FDA. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.""  [Which the FDA explains here](http://www.fda.gov/Food/DietarySupplements/ConsumerInformation/ucm191930.htm#wording).  One that same page you have the FDA saying that the [serving size](http://www.fda.gov/Food/DietarySupplements/ConsumerInformation/ucm191930.htm#serving_size) [ and safety/effectiveness](http://www.fda.gov/Food/DietarySupplements/ConsumerInformation/ucm191930.htm#claim_evidence) of all supplements in the US are not regulated and there isn't consumer protection because to go against a supplement [the burden is on the FDA to prove that it is unsafe](http://www.fda.gov/Food/DietarySupplements/ConsumerInformation/ucm191930.htm#FDA_oversight) and at the same time [lacks the funding to do the job it has regardless of the fact that it does not analyze any supplements prior to market](http://www.fda.gov/Food/DietarySupplements/ConsumerInformation/ucm191930.htm#FDA_analyze).  With all of that ambiguity over what is in supplements, I would much rather have drugs that are heavily regulated and tested for years prior to use for their proper use, safe, and efficacy.  So sure there are medications and treatment methodologies out there that are either misused/diagnosed or just dangerous for a certain % of patients, but to me at least there are those figures and there is a system for those treatment methodologies that requires the manufacturers to maintain set standards and consistently prove that their treatment is net beneficial instead of having the FDA trying to prove that the treatment is pointless or harmful. The other thing is that when it comes to people getting information on these products the knowledge is very cloudy at best because [the firms can release just whatever they want to release](http://www.fda.gov/Food/DietarySupplements/ConsumerInformation/ucm191930.htm#claim_evidence) and again (i know i am repeating myself) they do not get vetted like normal drugs so no one really knows how effective these things are.  To me my health and the health of my loved ones is a very serious matter and before I am going to trust them or myself to a treatment I want to know that it at least has had a thorough examination.  And while it is possible that I might encounter a less than great medication but at least I know it was tested and examined first.  It may not be perfect but it is better than the supplement alternative, to me anyway.  Finally the bit about experiences ""rewiring"" the brain is not the same as what I am talking about with ""rewiring"" the brain.  I am saying that depending on what you put in your body you could destroy receptors for various neurotransmitters and as a result have potentially permanent debilitating side effects like depression, cognitive impairment, movement issues, etc.  TL:DR You do not know what these things do, how much is safe/dangerous/pointless, what the real short/medium/longterm risks/benefits are, and what these things interact with as far as other medicines go, you are just rolling the dice and spending money.",✝

I can't blame some people for their pessimistic views on relationships.  Some people have shitty friends and a terrible family dynamic and have never really experienced caring people in their lives.      I on the other hand have some friends who have helped me and will help me in the future when I need it and I will likely not repay them.

I know that the statistic went up in 2005, so what?  [According to a **2009** study, there were 46 incidents of rape per 100,000 residents. This figure is twice that of the UK which reports 23 cases, and four times that of the other Nordic countries, Germany and France. The figure is up to 20 times the figure for certain countries in southern and eastern Europe.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_statistics#Sweden)  **""Rape rate"" per 100.000 residents** in Sweden was **25.2** in **2004** and **41.9** in **2005**. So there is a significant increase like you said. However, then it goes up every year after that, and in **2010** it is **63.5**. Try your best to explain that.  &gt;Also, are you a swedish resident or do you have any insight into the country what so ever?   What an idiotic argument. I bet you are one of those persons who think that men should not be allowed to talk about women's rights or white people shouldn't talk about racism. Of course I can say what I want about Swedish immigrant policy or crime as long as it's backed up by facts, and it is.  &gt;I can say with confidence (...) I don't need statistics to know this.  And this (hopefully) ends the conversation. You are a great example of a person who discusses political issues based on how he feels and not based on facts.

You should go for multiple sources  to study and see what suits your style of learning best.

If you are in the letter category, get yourself a windows 7 trial version from Microsoft tech net install it on a VM and try out all the obscure stuff you normally wouldn't use because you would be too afraid that it breaks something.

Microsoft is conatnly having promotions where they sell a bundles of test vouchers each with a test second shot option each. http://aka.ms/secondshot you will have to look yourself if there is one offered for the time and test you are seeking.

t5_2qqjc,secretvictory,1361481356,"CategoriesFollowReceive NBCNews newslettersCloseupdated 12/12/2010 10:22:52 AM ET  Pakistan doctor arrested on blasphemy suspicion  By ASHRAF KHANThe Associated PressKARACHI, Pakistan — Pakistani authorities have arrested a doctor on suspicion of violating the country's contentious blasphemy law by throwing away a business card of a man who shared the name of Islam's prophet, Muhammad, police said Sunday.The blasphemy law has been widely criticized by human rights groups following the case of Asia Bibi, a Christian woman sentenced to death last month for insulting Islam. Critics say the law should be amended or repealed because it is often used to settle grudges, persecute minorities and fan religious extremism.Naushad Valiyani, a Muslim doctor in the southern city of Hyderabad, was arrested Friday after a complaint was lodged with police alleging his actions had insulted the Prophet Muhammad, said regional police chief Mushtaq Shah.The case began Friday when Muhammad Faizan, a pharmaceutical company representative, visited Valiyani's clinic and handed out his business card. He said when the doctor threw the card away, Faizan went to police and filed a complaint that noted his name was the same as the prophet's.Shah said police were investigating whether Valiyani should be charged with blasphemy.Dozens of Pakistanis are sentenced to death each year under the blasphemy law, though most cases are thrown out by higher courts and no executions have been carried out. The law, however, is unlikely to be repealed because the government's ruling party — largely secular — relies on the support of Islamist groups.Islamist political parties have recently demonstrated in support of the law and the sentence against Bibi. One hard-line cleric said if the government did not execute Bibi, his mosque would pay anyone who killed her $5,800.Continue reading  More news  Related video  Obama announces troop reduction in Afghanistan (01:13)Dozens die in stampede during festival in India (00:31)Britain packing its equipment in Afghanistan (02:05)Switch to: Basic mobile site Regular siteAbout us Contact us Careers Stock dataSite map Terms &amp; conditions© 2013 NBCNews.com  Privacy policy",©

t5_2rfxx,Sushifighter,1361484712,"for those who cannot use facebook:  Hey everyone out there! I'm Froggen and today is my birthday so I would like to write about my past year as a pro player because it's without a doubt been the best year of my life.  One year ago we were a relatively new team that had been together for roughly 2 months at the time and we already had our first win at Kings of Europe against Moscow 5. It was the first time people would have heard of me ever, as before I was a rather unknown player in High ELO and the people who knew me thought I could only play Anivia - It was pretty much time to prove them all wrong.  There wasn't a lot of online tournaments going on after Kings of Europe so all we could do was practice for the next tournament. Approximately one or two months later go4lols and 4pl started to be relevant in the league scene - these were the start of a lot of tournaments that made me really motivated to improve as a player. Meanwhile in my real life it was actually getting a bit tough to play all the tournaments as I basically I didn't get enough sleep because some tournaments kept me awake until after midnight and I started taking my drivers license (in Denmark that takes like 3months if not more) as well as also doing homework and attend school which made me slack quite a bit in school and when I would get home from school I would sleep or stream. During that time I was streaming quite a lot despite not having many viewers.  As we won more tournaments and we were the only team despite the old aAa that could consistently win against Moscow5 - It was clear to me that we were a top EU team and we were here to stay. IEM Hannover was around March and it was my first offline tournament I attended, although not as a player but a spectator and it was the first time I got to meet all the pros and see how it was at a tournament. It was a bit surprising for me at first when I got to see all the pro players was hanging out together and basically just having a ton of fun. IEM Hannover was also the first tournament where people would come and take pictures with me or want my autograph. It was really weird at first because I didn't expect people to know me since I hadn't played in any offline tournaments and I had yet to prove myself offline. However I happily took some pictures and gave some autographs.  During spring we won a whole lot of online tournaments leading up to our first offline tournament which was MLG Anaheim. This was also my first time out of Europe and I was really excited for the tournament, however I quickly realized online and offline is not close to being the same. There is a lot more noise and communication problems offline and I have a problem that my hands will be cold in the arenas we play at -MLG was overall a nice event even though we had a few sound issues. MLG Anaheim was also the tournament where I brought out AP kog maw and the tournament I started playing Karthus in. Three days after Anaheim we had Dreamhack Summer coming up where we had to qualify through BYOC which we did flawlessly. I'm sure a lot of you remember the comeback we made against Moscow 5 and then beating them in the Dreamhack finals afterwards - for me thats the 3rd biggest achievement in my past year.  So came the time where I should decide if I wanted to drop out of school to go to Korea for a few months or if I should finish my studies first. As you all know I chose to go to Korea with my 4 fellow team mates and that has been the best experience in my life so far - It was simply awesome.  Their passion for E-sports is really insane and I got recognized on the streets almost instantly. In the start I was a bit worried about the rumours I heard from Fnatic when they had been there. They would be called “yankees” and get trolled in solo queue - But it was nothing like that. Everyone would try hard and everybody wanted to improve. We arrived a couple of weeks before our first group stage match for the OGN Summer tournament, which helped us adjust to the Korean meta just in time to have a tactic prepared against them. We pretty much lost every single game the first week we scrimmed as their early aggression made us look like 1200 ELO players and it was nothing like the (at that time) long laning phase in EU.   While we were in Korea I also had a lot of the spotlight and almost all the questions after our OGN matches would be directed at me. It was also the first time people started shouting ""Froggen, Froggen, Froggen"" and it felt pretty awesome to get recognized by so many people. Due to all that fame, there was no way failure would be acceptable for me so I started to practise even harder and pretty much the entire day. After qualifying from group stages we had to face WE (world elite) which was the only team to not ban Anivia in 1 game. We won against them 2-0 and went to the semifinals against Najin Sword which we beat 3-1. After all our matches we would go out and eat with all the people we knew, even Maknoon joined us for dinner after beating them 3-1.  After coming to the finals in OGN Summer we had Gamescom coming up, the S2 Final Qualifiers and the most important games of our lives were played there. Our preparation for Gamescom was pretty bad because we arrived 4 days early to get over the jet lag and prepared for our matches, but apparently there isn't any net cafe's in Cologne so we didn’t play for all that time leading up to our first match. Luckily we still managed to get through to top 3 by beating Fnatic in the 3th-4th place match. Following that we went back to Korea and 1 week later we went to Taiwan for a week to meet TPA and play a show match against them for G1. The arena the show match took off in was simply insane. I have never seen such a large crowd gathered at one place - G1 was the first time we got to play Lux vs another team for real. We played Lux vs Taiwan Allstars and we won the match pretty convincingly. After that game we faced TPA and they left open Anivia since it was a show match. After the game they came over and say, wow well played and I was really happy about that game. After the game we went to take pictures with all the fans for as long as we could. we only had about an hour and we basically just raised our arms and they would come in under them. “Under my wings” as Anivia would say. It was really hard to keep smiling for 30minutes straight while having raised arms but I managed to do it and we are still talking about that day today.  After the week in Taiwan I went to Korea again for 3 days to play the OGN finals against Azubu Frost it was an amazing venue. When I arrived 3 hours before the finals was to be played there was thousands of people already there. We lost 2-3 and I was even more sad to lose after getting outside and standing on the stage itself, it was really beautiful. Then I went to the US which were my next big trip, the preparation for World Finals Season 2! I went to live with CLG.NA in their gaming house in Burbank, it wasn't the most pleasant stay but we managed.   Season2 finals was something special, partly because of the legendary World Elite vs CLG.EU day and partly because it was just awesome all over. We managed to get out of the group stage pretty easy and then we had to play WE which was the most nerve wrecking game I've played to date – 7 hours for a Best of Three and we didn't even finish it. So we had a few extra days to prepare for a single game vs WE and we put maximum effort into winning that game, we couldn’t focus on anything else. We mapped out everything we wanted to do and we had 2 different strategies to use depending on what they would pick. We won that game and then we had to face Azubu Frost who we yet again lost to. All our loses in tournaments have been making me upset because I've felt like I could always do better. I also want to say that the arena for the finals was impressive and well done by Riot – really amazing!   After Season 2 the team and I agreed on a one month break to go see families and friends back in Europe as we travelled so much in 2012. Myself and Wickd were the only one to stay in US and I went on to stream every single day, but it wasn't really a healthy life I lived for that month and it was really tiring but I picked up a lot of new tricks. After the month break we had 4 tournaments in November which we got 3rd MLG Dallas, 1st at lone star clash, 2nd at Dreamhack Winter and 5-6th IPL5. Those results were okay personally because we hadn't been practising for a month and my new mid champions worked out really well. It was the first time my team allowed me to play something else than AP mid which was a good feeling for me because I knew those champions were good despite not being AP. We also learned a lot from doing so and we were a few steps ahead into Season 3 which brought a lot of bruisers in mid lane.   After IPL5 I went back home to Denmark to see my parents and my brother as I hadn't seen them for 5-6 months so I was really happy to see them again. For the next 2 months I spend my time keeping up my skill in League but I also tried to be with my family more since I knew I would be moving to Germany in January/February 2013.  I also signed with EG in January 2013 and left CLG with a feeling that something even bigger would happen in Season3. I went on a holiday from 4th-11th January with my family to spend some time with them before I left for Germany - after the holiday I tried to make a strict practise schedule so we could get back into the rhythm. Then I moved to Germany and I am now living in 2 apartments with my 4 team-mates. We are finally good to go and can practice hard every single day. I would say this year has been full of success and I've met a lot of new friends and I just hope to be the best and I will do everything to make it happen.  I tried to keep it short but it's kinda hard when having such an awesome year. This is truly a dream ♥",♥

t5_2rfxx,methwow,1361484767,"Hey everyone out there! I'm Froggen and today is my birthday so I would like to write about my past year as a pro player because it's without a doubt been the best year of my life.  One year ago we were a relatively new team that had been together for roughly 2 months at the time and we already had our first win at Kings of Europe against Moscow 5. It was the first time people would have heard of me ever, as before I was a rather unknown player in High ELO and the people who knew me thought I could only play Anivia - It was pretty much time to prove them all wrong.  There wasn't a lot of online tournaments going on after Kings of Europe so all we could do was practice for the next tournament. Approximately one or two months later go4lols and 4pl started to be relevant in the league scene - these were the start of a lot of tournaments that made me really motivated to improve as a player. Meanwhile in my real life it was actually getting a bit tough to play all the tournaments as I basically I didn't get enough sleep because some tournaments kept me awake until after midnight and I started taking my drivers license (in Denmark that takes like 3months if not more) as well as also doing homework and attend school which made me slack quite a bit in school and when I would get home from school I would sleep or stream. During that time I was streaming quite a lot despite not having many viewers.  As we won more tournaments and we were the only team despite the old aAa that could consistently win against Moscow5 - It was clear to me that we were a top EU team and we were here to stay. IEM Hannover was around March and it was my first offline tournament I attended, although not as a player but a spectator and it was the first time I got to meet all the pros and see how it was at a tournament. It was a bit surprising for me at first when I got to see all the pro players was hanging out together and basically just having a ton of fun. IEM Hannover was also the first tournament where people would come and take pictures with me or want my autograph. It was really weird at first because I didn't expect people to know me since I hadn't played in any offline tournaments and I had yet to prove myself offline. However I happily took some pictures and gave some autographs.  During spring we won a whole lot of online tournaments leading up to our first offline tournament which was MLG Anaheim. This was also my first time out of Europe and I was really excited for the tournament, however I quickly realized online and offline is not close to being the same. There is a lot more noise and communication problems offline and I have a problem that my hands will be cold in the arenas we play at -MLG was overall a nice event even though we had a few sound issues. MLG Anaheim was also the tournament where I brought out AP kog maw and the tournament I started playing Karthus in. Three days after Anaheim we had Dreamhack Summer coming up where we had to qualify through BYOC which we did flawlessly. I'm sure a lot of you remember the comeback we made against Moscow 5 and then beating them in the Dreamhack finals afterwards - for me thats the 3rd biggest achievement in my past year.  So came the time where I should decide if I wanted to drop out of school to go to Korea for a few months or if I should finish my studies first. As you all know I chose to go to Korea with my 4 fellow team mates and that has been the best experience in my life so far - It was simply awesome.

I went to live with CLG.NA in their gaming house in Burbank, it wasn't the most pleasant stay but we managed.  &gt; &gt;Season2 finals was something special, partly because of the legendary World Elite vs CLG.EU day and partly because it was just awesome all over. We managed to get out of the group stage pretty easy and then we had to play WE which was the most nerve wrecking game I've played to date – 7 hours for a Best of Three and we didn't even finish it. So we had a few extra days to prepare for a single game vs WE and we put maximum effort into winning that game, we couldn’t focus on anything else. We mapped out everything we wanted to do and we had 2 different strategies to use depending on what they would pick. We won that game and then we had to face Azubu Frost who we yet again lost to. All our loses in tournaments have been making me upset because I've felt like I could always do better. I also want to say that the arena for the finals was impressive and well done by Riot – really amazing!  &gt; &gt;After Season 2 the team and I agreed on a one month break to go see families and friends back in Europe as we travelled so much in 2012. Myself and Wickd were the only one to stay in US and I went on to stream every single day, but it wasn't really a healthy life I lived for that month and it was really tiring but I picked up a lot of new tricks. After the month break we had 4 tournaments in November which we got 3rd MLG Dallas, 1st at lone star clash, 2nd at Dreamhack Winter and 5-6th IPL5. Those results were okay personally because we hadn't been practising for a month and my new mid champions worked out really well. It was the first time my team allowed me to play something else than AP mid which was a good feeling for me because I knew those champions were good despite not being AP. We also learned a lot from doing so and we were a few steps ahead into Season 3 which brought a lot of bruisers in mid lane.  &gt; &gt;After IPL5 I went back home to Denmark to see my parents and my brother as I hadn't seen them for 5-6 months so I was really happy to see them again. For the next 2 months I spend my time keeping up my skill in League but I also tried to be with my family more since I knew I would be moving to Germany in January/February 2013.  &gt;I also signed with EG in January 2013 and left CLG with a feeling that something even bigger would happen in Season3. I went on a holiday from 4th-11th January with my family to spend some time with them before I left for Germany - after the holiday I tried to make a strict practise schedule so we could get back into the rhythm. Then I moved to Germany and I am now living in 2 apartments with my 4 team-mates. We are finally good to go and can practice hard every single day. I would say this year has been full of success and I've met a lot of new friends and I just hope to be the best and I will do everything to make it happen. &gt; &gt;I tried to keep it short but it's kinda hard when having such an awesome year. This is truly a dream ♥ ",♥

It is a hardware level interface that allows direct control of the motherboard remotely, including the BIOS. Problems that cause the OS to crash or become unresponsive can be addressed without needing physical access to the server. Reboots, BIOS changes, and sometimes KVM like access are all handled over this interface.  **[Input Output Memory Management Unit (I/O MMU):]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOMMU)** Unlike VT-x and AMD-V, IOMMU is a chipset level technology that gives virtual machines direct access peripherals like PCI-e cards. IOMMU works by transparently mapping physical addresses for memory to virtual address, which can have uses outside virtualization. Not only must the CPU and chipset support this feature, the BIOS must contain certain special features, such as ACPI IVRS tables. **Differences:** Various consumer chipset support IOMMU, but BIOS support is often poor. All recent server platforms support IOMMU.  **[VT-c:]( http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/network-adapters/virtualization.html)** Intel Virtualization Technology for Connectivity. “Virtual Machine Device Queues (VMDQ) improve traffic management within the server by offloading traffic sorting and routing from the hypervisor’s virtual switch to the Ethernet Controller. PCI-SIG Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV) allows partitioning of a single Intel® Ethernet Server Adapter port into multiple virtual functions. IT administrators can use these virtual ports to create multiple isolated connections to virtual machines.”  **Memory Slots:** Most consumer motherboards have 4 memory slots, with some high end platforms supporting 8. Today’s server platforms support up to 12 DIMMS per socket, meaning 24, 36, or more slots on a multi-socket board.  **Expandability:** Most consumer motherboards are limited to 6 SATA ports since that is usual provided by the chipset. [Some server boards]( http://www.supermicro.com/products/motherboard/Xeon/C600/X9SRi-3F.cfm) support 12 SATA ports in a standard ATX form factor. The focus on expandability is another differentiator of server platforms.

t5_2qhk3,Thievishmetal69,1361504990,"&gt;You have no problem with the gender wage gap.  Why would I take issue with something that doesn't exist.  &gt;You insist that it’s a scientifically proven fact that men are stronger than women.  That would be because...oh I don't know..it is.  Second time today typing this out, but  REALITY DON'T REAL!  &gt;You believe that the age of consent is unfair and that there’s nothing wrong with having sex with teenage girls.  I don't know about other MRAs but I know the age of consent is really often just an arbitrary number, like the drinking and smoking age.  That said, kids still in high school are better off not running the risk of having kids.  Addressing the latter part, and relating to what I said earlier the number is arbitrary, there are some kids younger than 12 out there who would make more responsible adults than a whoooole lot of adults, its better though to draw the line somewhere to protect those who don't have the maturity to deal with adult issues.  30 yr old screwing around with a 16 year old....thats a bit shady.  19 yr old screwing around with a 16 year old...so?   Thing is these people can't differentiate those situations.  &gt;You hate when a woman automatically assumes that a man is a douchebag before getting to know him.  I'm...so confused.  I'm not supposed to hate when someone assumes I'm a douche because I'm a man?  Feminism™  &gt;You believe that if women want equality, they should be drafted into the military. But you also believe that the military is not a place for women.  Because you know...we know how safe it is to be in a military if you're a man, it's not like history is painted with the blood of billions of dead men who were...guess what, in the military.  Women want the same rights as men, they damn well put up with the same responsibilities.     &gt;You hate when women assume that men are like wild animals.  Again, just like the douche quote, quite frankly the person who wrote this shit needs to do the world a favor and hang from a tree.  &gt;You hate the fact that men are bullied for not conforming to their male gender roles. But when you find out that a man disagrees with your beliefs about women’s rights, your immediate response is to try to emasculate him by comparing him to a woman as an insult.  Only half right, its highly looked down upon for MRAs to emasculate other MRAs, we get enough of that from the kinds of people who write this garbage.  &gt;You hate when women assume that there are no nice guys. But you call yourself a nice guy and act like it’s a rare quality that should cause women to be all over you.  Yea, the MRM and this whole ""nice guy"" thing are two separate issues conflated into one in the minds of intellectual fatuous people like feminists.  That said this ""nice guy"" phenomenon is the result of modern female entitlement and men who have ZERO self respect after 100 years of male bashing.  &gt;You hate when women assume that men just want to get laid. But when you find out that a man is a feminist, you assume that he’s just doing it to get laid.  There are only 3 reasons a man would identify with an ideology that despises his very existence, he himself willingy hates men, he is a ""beta male"" as they're called, human doormat is a more common term for it, or like most self identified feminists, you're completely ignorant of the very ideology you campaign for.  This quote brings to mind the story about a male feminist who got all buddy buddy with those man hating spinsters and raped one of them.    &gt;You hate when women make generalizations about all men. But when a woman calls you out for being sexist, you claim that all men think like you.  Unfounded claim.  &gt;You insist that women should be responsible for protecting themselves from being raped. But when they follow the one piece of advice that actually works, which is being aware of red flags, you complain about them assuming that all men are rapists.  That would be because your ""red flag"" is that a person has a penis.  Eat shit and die you man hating piece of human shit, sincerely an MRA. ",™

t5_2uczz,Armed_Liberal,1361519414,"I would reserve judgement on whether or not this is rape. I think you need to involve a professional; somnolent sex, sexomnia, or sleep sex is something that really does happen, the person really does NOT have control over their actions, and it's really something that needs medication to stop.  I suffer from REM Sleep Behavior Disorder, PTSD and a history of multiple head traumas… among other things (I'm ex-military). In the past, I have broken through sleep atonia and acted out my dreams. I have been notoriously dangerous to wake — I have been known to punch, kick and elbow in my sleep if someone is trying to wake me and I'm having a dream about combat. One night, I was having a dream about hand-to-hand combat (something that happened to me quite a bit when I was a teen), and I nearly gouged out my girlfriend's eye. I woke up when she started crying out in pain, and immediately stopped, but the both of us were quite shaken. She and I have since parted ways for different reasons, but for a while she was afraid to sleep in the same bed as me. This was about 3 and a half years ago.  I take clonazepam (Klonipin®) nightly to suppress this condition now, and it works well. My domestic partner says that she can tell when I don't take a full dose of clonazepam, or when I don't at all (such as if I forget).   If it's out of his character to do these things while conscious (like be so aggressive about sex), then it's probable that he has an underlying medical condition that's likely the cause of this. I would NEVER have done anything to harm my ex-gf, then or now, but I literally was not in control of my actions. These things happen, and they are real, but you NEED the professional assistance of a sleep pathologist to diagnose and treat such conditions.",®
t5_2r2jt,atesomesoup2,1361519471,"People commenting here are right. You can’t let this situation continue. But you don’t need to call CPS today.  I would suggest that 1) you talk to your father first. Try to get him on the same page before you do anything 2) look into the options and resources you have around you.   It may be helpful to talk to some helplines first. I’m not saying don’t call CPS, definitely do call, if no changes are made. What I’m saying is that you may be able to try and change her behaviour first. If you can’t, hopefully you will still have your dad on your side rather than have alienated him.  I think that your first step would be sitting down with your father, somewhere without your sister present and sometime when you can discuss this for an hour or two straight. This is in everyone’s best interests, including your sister. It goes without saying that you are the best person to decide how this conversation will happen. But I would suggest framing it as something that you BOTH NEED to do for the SAFETY of your nephew, sister, and father.  On that note, it would be best to straighten everything out in your own head before you talk to him. Think about:  a) what needs to change in the living situation and your sister’s behaviour towards both dad and son (e.g. get the child on Medicaid, keep the common living areas clean). After you’ve got a list, it would be helpful to break each problem down into specific and measurable goals/actions. E.g. Moves her things out of the living room. Vaccuums carpet once a week.  b) Plan and write down what you’re going to say. Show him your post if you have to. He’s going to be resistant, so it would be helpful to think of what he is likely to say and counterarguments.  Here are some thoughts…  *The last time my dad got onto her about where she's going in life…*   *But convincing my father to report her is useless. He's just as furious with her as everyone else is, he just feels powerless to do anything.*  *My father is 63 years old and can't keep up with the cleaning and maintenance so he just quietly deals with it, though it's visible that it's tearing him apart. *  So, your dad wants change just like you. The problem is he doesn’t know how, feels powerless, and may not think that it is possible.  At this point he’s just quietly going along with it and trying not to rock the boat because it’s the easiest option and he does not want to make the situation worse. But allowing your sister to behave the way she is now will definitely not be easier in the long run, and there’s no guarantee that she her behaviour will not worsen. All she does is push boundaries and she KNOWS that she can MANIPULATE your father.   Actually, given the filthy living conditions (which are increasing), lack of child supervision, lack of child healthcare, your father’s deteriorating health, it is only a matter of time before something serious happens, either to your nephew or dad.   What’s he going to do if one of them gets sick or injured and requires hospitalisation? I’m guessing that your dad is supporting all three of them and there might be some welfare money coming in? How much savings does he have? Since your sister can’t look after herself, let alone a child, what does he expect will happen if something happens to him? Does he expect you to take her in? (If so, you can just point blank say that would never happen without drastic change.) Will she survive on welfare? Does he think that she can raise her kid alone? If she’s going to be given the house/some inheritance money/be able to survive financially, I would remind you that the only cleaning being done in the house is coming from him and you and she doesn’t supervise her child.  What is he going to do if he requires care later, in old age?  Can he guarantee that he will always be able to tolerate her? That he will never be forced to have her leave (e.g. health reasons)? What if she starts dating someone as horrible as her and moves him in? Which if she gets pregnant again?   How does he think his grandson will turn out in such an environment?   How does he think the child will behave as he gets older, with a mother who physically attacks people and behaves without basic decency towards others (or is it just her father since she knows that he will do nothing)?  At some point, remind him of this *usually threats of cutting since she was into that, but she stopped that very quickly after she tried to blame her postpartum depression on me that she was going to start cutting but I told her I wouldn't hesitate to call CPS in a heartbeat if she did that.* She knows exactly what she’s doing and if your dad refused to put up with her bullshit like you his life would improve (not to mention the health of everyone in the house).  *Pretty much telling him ""You need to report it or you're going to end up a criminal with possible jail time because I will if you don't"" isn't going to be the best way to do this.*  You’re right there. But this isn’t about threat of jail time. You’re pushing this because something NEEDS to be done for the safety of your sister’s child, your dad, and your sister. However, you can still bring this up in your conversation.  If the conversation(s) goes well, you and your dad can think of ways to get help and improve this situation for everyone. The reason I mentioned the helplines before is that they should be able to give you more practical strategies to make this happen.

Here is an article on locating low cost therapy in the US (for emotional support and practical suggestions).  http://captainawkward.com/2011/09/22/how-to-locate-low-cost-mental-health-care-in-the-us-and-canada-guest-post/  If you do call CPS and they don’t do much, take too long, etc, you could try calling and elderly abuse service. Actually, in this case, calling an elderly abuse helpline may be more helpful in terms of practical strategies. http://www.state.il.us/aging/1athome/i-a.htm#national http://www.ncea.aoa.gov/ncearoot/Main_Site/Find_Help/APS/How_APS_Works.aspx   I’ve talked a lot about changing your sister’s behaviour but a) it’s going to be hard and b) you may not be able to. You may just need to call CPS.  **The main problem is that your dad and sister live in the same house.**  She could get dangerous. She could start destroying the house. Before talking to your dad, consult a lawyer or at least do some googling. What are your dad’s options? If she got violent/became even more unbearable to live with, how long would it take to evict her? If she got evicted, would she take her kid with her or leave him with your dad (until she found a place)? What are the local shelters around your area for her? Would your dad call the police if she got violent?  Also, she will not actually change without the threat of calling CPS, an elderly abuse service/eviction. She not going to immediately grow a sense of human decency if you say change. The only reason that she will get her act together is because it will be less work for her. E.g. you can live here rent free but you need to live like reasonable human being vs you need to move out, get a job/rent assistance, live in a less nice place, and have a landlord who will kick you out for living in filth anyway. Also, you need timeframes otherwise she’ll come up with bullshit excuses.  In addition, she has spent so long being emotionally and physically abusive to get her way that her first response to any attempt to set boundaries will be to become more abusive. If you and your dad do try and set some boundaries, you MUST have real consequences for breaking them. This will NOT work with empty threats, otherwise any future attempt to change her behaviour will have less chance of success (all she will learn is acting worse = get my own way). This means that if your dad tries to change her then finds it too hard and stops, you at least need to follow through on them, as much as you can. You may not be able to change how she treats your dad but you can do something for the child.    ",®
t5_2uczz,Armed_Liberal,1361520364,"transplanting my comments to the new thread.  I would reserve judgement on whether or not this is rape. I think you need to involve a professional; somnolent sex, sexomnia, or sleep sex is something that really does happen, the person really does NOT have control over their actions, and it's really something that needs medication to stop.  I suffer from REM Sleep Behavior Disorder, PTSD and a history of multiple head traumas… among other things (I'm ex-military). In the past, I have broken through sleep atonia and acted out my dreams. I have been notoriously dangerous to wake — I have been known to punch, kick and elbow in my sleep if someone is trying to wake me and I'm having a dream about combat. One night, I was having a dream about hand-to-hand combat (something that happened to me quite a bit when I was a teen), and I nearly gouged out my girlfriend's eye. I woke up when she started crying out in pain, and immediately stopped, but the both of us were quite shaken. She and I have since parted ways for different reasons, but for a while she was afraid to sleep in the same bed as me. This was about 3 and a half years ago.  I take clonazepam (Klonipin®) nightly to suppress this condition now, and it works well. My domestic partner says that she can tell when I don't take a full dose of clonazepam, or when I don't at all (such as if I forget). If it's out of his character to do these things while conscious (like be so aggressive about sex), then it's probable that he has an underlying medical condition that's likely the cause of this. I would NEVER have done anything to harm my ex-gf, then or now, but I literally was not in control of my actions. These things happen, and they are real, but you NEED the professional assistance of a sleep pathologist to diagnose and treat such conditions.",®

t5_2qudv,WaltMitty,1361545445,"Full article:  That actor you're watching onstage tonight? He or she might well have skin in the game. And I speak not just of art or hunger for applause. I talk of cold, hard cash.  One of the more interesting and perhaps lesser noticed changes in show business these last few years has been the transition of touring shows away from fixed salaries to compensation models based on how many seats are filled.  Not so long ago, back in the glory of the early 1990s when multiple companies of ""The Phantom of the Opera"" convoyed across the Midwest, most touring Broadway shows offered actors production contracts, which meant financial rewards and working conditions that mirrored those on Broadway. In fact, for your average Broadway actor (especially the younger and freer variety), going on tour with a show could mean a more attractive deal than in New York. On the road, actors got nice per diems with no obligation to spend all that money if they could stay with friends. They could live on their per diem and bank the salary.  The production contract, the holy grail for actors, still exists in touring theater. But it's limited to a very small number of massively successful shows: ""Wicked,"" ""Jersey Boys,"" ""The Lion King,"" ""The Book of Mormon."" That's about all. Those shows pay their actors minimum salaries of $1,754 per week — and in practice, closer to $2,000, given the various add-ons for understudying and the like. But almost every other Equity show on the road — ""Peter Pan,"" ""Priscilla Queen of the Desert,"" even ""Les Miserables"" — operates under a different contract with a far lower minimum salary for actors. Under the now-common contracts called short engagement touring agreements (or SETAs), salaries are less than half the full rates.  With a kick. If the show sells well, the actors get ""overages,"" a revenue-sharing deal that increases when shows have recouped their production costs.  ""We had to recognize that the economics of the touring business have changed,"" said Mary McColl, the executive director of Actors' Equity, over lunch recently in Chicago. McColl was explaining that the new contracts were an attempt to prevent shows from going the non-Equity route — not that the effort was totally successful, given that ""Catch Me If You Can,"" which arrives in Chicago in a few weeks, is touring with a non-Equity cast. But McColl also noted that the new contract had stopped the producers of ""Billy Elliot"" (which operated under a production contract while it was in Chicago) from turning their tour into a non-Equity show. Perhaps the producers also understood the signal that would send — given that the show is about the struggle of a union.  McColl also said that her members can do very well under the SETA and other concessionary deals when a show is hugely successful. When ""Les Miserables"" was in Chicago last fall, for example, box-office returns were so strong that the actors got, McColl said, compensation ""comparable to the production-contract rates."" Nonetheless, that is not always the case.  Actors from ""Peter Pan,"" for example, were chagrined to see some empty rows during their Chicago run, being as this cut their paychecks from the overages they had been enjoying in less competitive cities. If you are touring with Cathy Rigby, you have a vested interested in putting the proverbial butts in the seats to see her fly.  What does this mean for you, the audience?  Well, it's overly simplistic to say shows that offer performers production contracts are going to get better actors; art is not that easy to categorize. And you could argue that actors with skin in the game work harder, just like any other employee with a profit-sharing incentive. But in most professions, the higher-paying gigs attract the bigger talents, and theater is no exception. It has been a while since I've seen the touring cast of ""Wicked,"" but I sure know that the creative team of that show has a wide pool of talent from which to choose. Production contracts are now rare on the road. Economic logic would suggest that those performers would, in very general terms, be the cream of the crop.  Of course, there is no adjustment in ticket price based on any of this. The type of Equity contract is not the kind of thing presenters like advertising. I try to point out when shows feature nonunion casts (the upcoming return visit of ""American Idiot"" being one), not because non-Equity actors are not worth seeing (many prove to be excellent) but because you will not be seeing anyone with Broadway experience. In the future, it might be worth noting what kind of Equity contract we're talking about, so you can judge that too.  And if you think Chicago theater, where love usually matters more than money, is immune from this issue, you'd be wrong. It's not unknown in the off-Loop scene for the very small stipends of non-Equity actors to become payable only when the box office hits its target.

t5_2sl0y,Rantsonablog,1361553129,"Basically what it came down to for me was my consistent -3 lbs a week that I had going for 2.5 months came to a halt and that was the only real change in diet. I started adding it because I was lifting  more seriously and know that it was always great for recovery in the past when my main goal wasn't fat loss. I just started feeling like I had been eating carbs again, kinda sluggish and bloated, so I cut it out and a few days later I was back to feeling ketoey™. My experience is completely anecdotal and everyone is probably different but considering how I was completely unaware of the possibility of the whey messing me up I figured I'd spread the word just in case you were ever stalling out.   As far as the fat and protein absorption issue I can't speak on it. I've now been operating under the assumption(hope) that I will be getting enough protein through my diet to at least keep muscle loss to a minimum until I'm thin enough to do a proper bulk. I would suggest r/ketogains though. That seems like the place that might have knowledge about the biochemical interplay. ",™

t5_2qh16,secrit,1361568973,"&gt;Glass is meant for the public setting, where people around you are talking anyway so it doesn't matter if you talk. You also don't have to talk very much and it is faster to talk for short commands.  SCENE:  A Metro bus.  A man is wearing Google Glass™.  A gaggle of technologically-impaired folk shuffle onto the bus with their loud and rowdy banter.  A tired mother, after scanning the rest of the bus, concedes to the only available seats for her and her child -- next to this very white, out-of-place gentleman.  Who's wearing what appears to be a broken pair of glasses with a tiny shard in one corner.  Oh, great, a crazy homeless man.  She sits next to the man as far away as she could, placing her child on the other side of her.  Suddenly, the man abruptly states in a mechanical monotone, ""Okay glass search tattoo parlors.""  Only it didn't quite sound right; his voice sounded slightly muffled, as if he may perhaps be partially deaf or has had a corrected cleft palette.  In any case, it came out more like, ""o'ay, glash searsh cacktoo phhh-harlorsh.""  She could barely hear him over the erupting laughter and hooting and clapping going on a few rows back, but the shrill timbre of his voice cut through it like a piss-covered knife.  She risks a glance at him to see his eyes flicker wildly for a minute, and then they close as he takes a slow, deep breath.  ""O'ay glash searsh cacktoo Losh Anj-less.""  His eyes re-open and he slumps back in his seat and continues looking slightly up, as if he may perhaps be high on drugs.  ""O'ay glash searsh Google mapsh.  Searsh tee, ay, tee, tee, oh, oh, nine, one, shiksth, sero, one.""  Without a moment's hesitation, she snatches her baby up and goes to stand towards the back of the bus.  She's tired, her baby is fat and heavy, and her arms are getting numb due to poor circulation from too much working, but this crazy talk is surely a prologue to a hysterical display of violent histrionics.  She mutters, ""Perdon, lo siento, 'scuse me please?"" as she makes her way through the packed aisle to get closer to the door for easier escape.  During this whole scenario, loud conversation continued to pervade the bus, but it was starting to become a little more scattered as more people were drawn to this budding psycho's disjointed monologue.  ""O'ay glash se'ect L.A. Tacktoo.""  She could still peer at him, sitting all alone with no one on the available seats on either side of him despite the number of people standing, and felt apprehensive as his eyes closed and his chest rose slowly with another slow, deep breath.  His jaw clenched.  His voice strained as he over-enunciated in his monotonic, mechanical intonation, ""Okay glash searsh el ay spashe tee ay tee tee oh oh.""  ""HEY, the fuck you doing over there?"" yelled one of the rambunctious conversationalists.  His buddy replied, ""Yo, I gotta get this on my phone, this dude's crazy!""  ""O'ay glash se-ect firsh reshul'.  O-kay, glasSSS, seLLeCK, FURST, REE-SULT-tah.  O'ay glash fine contack.""  ""You need help finding your contacts?""  quipped the passenger filming with his cell phone, drawing laughs from his buddies.  ""O'ay glash se-ect contackus.  O'ay glash call nummer.""  The bus slowed to a stop, and the mother clutched her baby to her busty chest as she fled to the bench to await the next bus on the same route.  Sitting on one end was a homeless transient wearing rainbow-colored Uggs, skin-tight leather pants, layers of shirts covered in a tuxedo jacket, and Mardi Gras beads around his neck holding a cell phone to one ear and cursing profusely.  She sits next to him with nary a cringe or a twitch, smiling and chattering away happily to her child in Spanish.  The next day, her 21-year-old baby daddy shows her a funny video on youtube entitled ""crazy white boi w/broken glasses talks 2 himself lol"" in which Google Glass™ continues to struggle with comprehending his speech defect during his quest to find a tattoo parlor in Hollywood.  It has over 5,000,000 views and a bunch of comments from every walk of life shredding his every flaw and encouraging his suicide.",™

He also threatened to stab her with his pen.   and  &gt;indicates that, one morning, as Einstein exited the bathroom, his wife wished him a ‘good morning’, at which, again, he flew into a fiery rage, pushing her in the face repeatedly and gouging her eyes.

You also said that he was sick when you met him (I'm assuming you mean ""sick the way that he currently is"").  If that's the case, you made a commitment to him - and you knew what you were getting into.  That doesn't mean that you need to martyr yourself for him.  However, it does mean you owe him every opportunity to save the marriage.  It sounds like this has been going on for a long time, and you've tried to address the issue with no success.  In that case, it may well be time for a Serious Conversation^® where you bring up deadlines - with Serious Consequences^® if they aren't met.  If you've already done that, then it may be time for an ultimatum.  Personally, though, I wouldn't start talking about serious (perhaps marriage-ending) consequences unless you're ready to follow through.  These aren't threats to be made lightly.  I know you feel that leaving isn't an option.  However, you may not be doing him any favors by enabling his behavior.

t5_2qhhu,MittRomneysCampaign,1361575409,"I have had this argument with people who study this sort of thing for quite some time. I took several classes precisely so I could hopefully get an answer to this question and my ex, who is now getting her Ph.D. in English, could not. It's common to unload the burden of why someone thinks another person is wrong onto another subject, like most people do when they say something is wrong with someone but instead of going into detail, just say a vague ""seek help""; in this case, though, most people would say ""if you don't know why poetry is good or bad, take a few English classes.""  Well, I have, and what I have yet to see disproven is that, in studying it, you are accepting criteria for judgment and your set of study assumes the criteria as objective before proceeding to the study of it. That is, you can establish a set of criteria and you can judge by the criteria, but that doesn't make the criteria objective determinants of good or bad; it makes the criteria, perhaps, standard among people who professionally study it, but that doesn't mean that they couldn't have adopted some other criteria if the social circumstances were different. Just because you've identified a set of criteria doesn't make your **valuation of the importance of those criteria** a subjective judgment.  In this case, you've implicitly given several criteria: metaphorical complexity (the difficulty and extent of the metaphor), the use of certain devices (linebreaks), the dominance of theme (""thesis""), the novelty of imagery (anti-cliche), general complexity (""you could analyze it all day..."") and again, dominance of theme (""...and see these elements working together""). You could make a checklist out of this:  COMPLEXITY (GENERAL): ☑  COMPLEXITY (METAPHORICAL): ☑  DOMINANCE OF THEME: ☑  NOVEL IMAGERY: ☑  DESIRED DEVICES: ☑  But what you've not established, and what I think still remains a strong argument in the ""it's subjective"" crowd, is that **these things are valued by you.** That you've established these things as ways of judging a poem does not mean that poems *have* to be judged this way, or that poems that fail this set of criteria makes them bad. It may appear, after criteria have been standardized, that any failure to meet them makes them bad, but that's only by those criteria.   Suppose someone took what you wrote here:  &gt; ""Hole in my heart"" is a cliche. It doesn't have any punch like fresh imagery does. And what better way to end this crap-fest than being told about an abstract emotion like pain. We're not surprised.  And said ""I don't mind ""hole in my heart."" I think it still has punch. I like it. Why would I want to be surprised? I don't care about being surprised. It still makes me feel.""  Or maybe someone doesn't feel that way, but instead they said: ""I don't care about metaphorical complexity. I like poems that don't take very long to figure out, because I feel like metaphorical complexity detaches me from the emotion being felt.""  What would make you right and this person wrong? I'm asking this rhetorically. The most common response to this is ***""You don't REALLY...""***, which is just a tear-down of the certainty of the person involved, hoping they might lose confidence in their answer. It's a set-up, so that if you say ""yes, I really,"" then you can call them stupid or uncultured or some other thing. But that's a circular definition: *what* makes them uncultured or stupid? Because they have not accepted your criteria? And what makes them wrong for not accepting your criteria? Be...cause they haven't accepted your criteria?  Some people go further than this and appeal to professional authority. But professional authority is nothing more than institutionalization: (1) I can make money off of this thing, and (2) I have organizations registered with the government that support my view. I could register ""the National Organization of Crunkcore Lolpoetry"", establish NOCL criteria for judging poems, and donate lots of money to the study of Crunkcore Lolpoetry in universities. This would certainly make for professional Crunkcore Lolpoets, but it wouldn't mean they're right. Some people are professional Scientologists. Do you dare contradict a professional?  You've used ""we're"" like this is a universal emotion, but it doesn't have to be. You are right in that a set of criteria can be established to evaluate a poem *more* objectively than you could while just judging it in kneejerk fashion. You can establish criteria like metaphorical complexity and evaluate poems more objectively than you could before. But that set of criteria would not be objectively right; someone could give a different set of criteria, and nothing would be there to objectively say whether one set is better than other.  To put this in terms more understandable, everyday terms, suppose you're looking for a smartphone. Someone has the following:  QWERTY KEYBOARD: ☑  8MP CAMERA: ☑  PINCH ZOOM: ☑  ROUNDED EDGES: ☑  Now I use slide-out keyboards all the time on my smartphone, and have been able to type at [very fast speeds](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrwQCdiUcv0) with this, but not everyone does. And someone says ""wait, I don't really care about a QWERTY keyboard. I like huge screens. I also don't care about an 8MP camera; 5MP is fine for me. I like pinch zoom. And why in the world do I care how rounded the phone's edges are?""  The person reacting has a very different value system. Creating criteria does create a more objective system of evaluation -- **by those criteria**. It does *not* make the criteria more objectively valuable in themselves, unless you have some external goal in mind. If you're trying to evaluate whether a building will collapse or not, the criteria for a building's sturdiness matter a lot. But ""good"" has no external product. ""Good"" does not occur in physical form; it's something humans invent and ascribe to things. It's a value statement.  I realize that you have a professional interest in, at the very least, *using* these criteria; don't think that I'm saying your degree is somehow less valuable, because I don't think that and I'm not saying that. You certainly *understand* poetry on a much deeper level than anyone would without the degree, and that's valuable in itself. So while I do think your reply does a very good job of showing *how* you can analyze poetry and what people in certain circles value for their poetry, it does *not* necessarily show that this set of values is superior to another, or that the criteria for judgment are superior to another.",☑

t5_2qn5f,Pete-Venters,1361577674,"Here's the FAQ -   The Gathering Pre-Launch FAQ - 2/21/13  Here's the lowdown on 'The Gathering' Kickstarter.  The FAQ will be updated as we draw closer to the campaign's launch!  (And please spread the word).   What is the Gathering?   'The Gathering' is an art book created by over 30 of the original artists of Magic: The Gathering® to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the game. The book is being published by Full Steam Press LLC.   What’s inside the book?  Every one of the 30+ artists involved received a two page spread to share their thoughts and anecdotes, and show off a new piece of art created especially for the book. * The book is not a collection of existing Magic art as that’s something Wizards of the Coast would have to produce. * Owing to circumstances a handful of artists are providing existing pieces.   Which Magic artists are involved?  Since the book is related to the 20th anniversary of Magic, it was decided to limit the artists to those that had Magic art in print by 1994. Since it’s a big list, it’s posted at the end of the FAQ. While we tried to include every applicable artist in this project, some were unable or uninterested in participating.   Are Wizards of the Coast going to allow this book to be made?  We have worked closely with Wizards throughout the development of 'The Gathering' and the book is produced with their permission.   What format is the book available in?  The book comes in three formats - softcover, hardcover, and the numbered collector’s edition with slipcase. There are no plans to publish in any electronic format.   Where can I buy this book?  You’ll be able to purchase a copy during the Kickstarter campaign that launches the last week of February. There are currently no plans for a full retail release.   How much is it going to cost?  There's several options. Pricing details will be revealed at launch.   Why Kickstarter?  Kickstarter is a great way to allow creators to connect directly with the public and a Kickstarter campaign allows us to correctly judge the demand for the book.   Can I order a copy from somewhere other than Kickstarter?  Some retailers may pick up copies from the Kickstarter campaign and Full Steam Press will likely have a few softcover and hardcover copies for sale, but beyond that it’s unlikely you’ll be able to find the book, at least at its original price. The best option is to participate in the Kickstarter campaign.   Who is Full Steam Press?  Full Steam Press LLC is a new publishing venture of Jeff A. Menges, who is one of the original Magic artists, and has over twenty years experience in book publishing.   Are you planning more books?  There are no plans for further books at this time. But, never say never!  Finally, the list of currently confirmed artists. We'll let you know when other other artists are confirmed.   Randy Asplund  Julie Baroh  Ed Beard Jr.  Nicola (Leonard) Beeson  Melissa A. Benson  Kevin Brockschmidt  Liz Danforth  Sandra Everingham  Dan Frazier  Kaja Foglio  Phil Foglio  Daniel Gelon  Quinton Hoover  Heather Hudson  Scott Kirschner  Michael Kimble  Pat (Morissey) Lewis  Jeff A.

t5_2tnz9,APRICATE_DERECHO,1361581052,"I'm a long-time fan of Langan's work, and I think that his actions, though sometimes abrasive, are generally justifiable. Some redditors linked to [this](http://onemansblog.com/2007/11/06/smartest-man-in-the-world-has-diarrhea-of-the-mouth/comment-page-2/#comments) thread in the TIL post, but I did not see any one of them link to that particular page. Here, you see that Langan has commented under his own name. Scroll down. He addresses most of the arguments made by those calling him out because of [the Errol Morris interview](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ak5Lr3qkW0). He actually wrote [an essay](http://megasociety.org/noesis/41/people.html) on similar topics under the pseudonym Eric Hart over 20 years ago.  There are a lot of misconceptions about Langan. If you remain civil, I'll be happy to answer a few questions. That said, the CTMU abounds with controversy; debates on it have [waged for months](http://scientopia.org/blogs/goodmath/2011/02/11/another-crank-comes-to-visit-the-cognitive-theoretic-model-of-the-universe/). There's no chance in hell that one reddit post suffices to get to the bottom of it. A huge amount of Langan's writing is online, and some of it offers simpler explanations of his work, but much of it is difficult to find through just a cursory search. IMO, the most informative interview with Langan is [this one](http://www.superscholar.org/interviews/christopher-michael-langan/). There's a Scary Bible Reference™ about halfway through, but rest assured that he reads that book just like he would any philosophical text.

But the problem I see (in the city I am here in the Great White North) is that people unfortunately do not take the time to do the research and frankly do not seem to care about this small, yet money saving technical detail.  Purging the lines during brazing with an inert gas prevents copper oxides. Which is definitely something you do not want as it can clog metering devices and filter dryers easily. Not to mention with the newer refrigerants (namely 410a) and its use of the new POE oil you really want to be careful as POE is EXTREMELY TEMPERAMENTAL.   Filter driers however seem to be a standard thing these days. They come with the condensing unit. Why some people are not installing them is beyond me.  The deep vacuum thing is one of the reasons im now at a commercial shop. I got into too many arguments with seasoned gas fitters about this. They liked to leave the vacuum pump on ""until it stops making popcorn."" So youve pulled some of the moisture out. If you have ever looked at the chart for a vacuum on a system (Carrier even puts one in the condensing units manuals) it shows that as the vacuum gets deeper, its harder to pull out more moisture and contaminants. Yeah you've removed the bulk of the air to the point that it wont cause non-condensible problems. But back to POE it is extremely hydroscopic. During its production phase it has its moisture removed. It wants it back and will take it anyway it can get it. Even if it means sucking the moisture out of the atmosphere on a humid day. BUT. If you have that same muggy air trapped in your line set in any amount, it will gladly take that moisture back into itself and begin to lose its lubricating properties.  So all in all that took me maybe 5 minutes to write? The problem is people (A) do not care as they probably lost comprehension around ""brazing with an inert gas."" To them now, this is me justifying throwing on the price of the nitrogen into the quote with my mark up. And (B) It all comes down to price. I was actually almost removed from installation and sent over to service at my former residential shop because to me when I do the work I like to think it reflects upon myself, my training, and my craftsmanship as a tradesman. I wanted to change lines because the old ones were oil logged due to someone changing a tin can and not reading the tag about the oil or replacing insulation as someone got too close with the weedwhacker years before. I don't want to get my superheat from the outside air and destroy my compression ratio and eventually the compressor. But the problem arose when I went the extra mile. It was cutting into the profits. Even the vacuum pump being on until I was done wiring-""wasting time.""  While it is valiant to try and educate the fact of the matter is that at the end of the day if we cannot make money, we will not be in business. And if the customer can get it cheaper, especially in residential, they will go for the cheaper quote. Not saying I condone this action at all. Yes of course this is hilarious when they go on sites like HVAC talk with horror stories and pictures of shoddy work and 2 year old units that are now lawn ornaments. But sometimes, we just have to do what the customer wants. Its ironic. Half a million dollar home, cheapest AC install. Good riddance resi market. Next house I do will be my own.  Sorry OP. Im a Lennox/Carrier guy personally. However of the options I would go for American Standard/Trane. Amana and Goodman are the same basically.

t5_2qh16,GSpotAssassin,1361582287,"If emotional relationships (at least as we currently conceive them) are destroyed by The Truth™... then... are they based on lies? And... should we continue to allow them to be based on lies?  Maybe we all need our collective cherries popped by the harsh truth?  This is one of the questions of life I am rather obsessed with. I am fairly convinced that if you took every married couple, and then told both spouses about alllll their counterparts' secret thoughts, flirtations, online dalliances, physical dalliances, kinky obsessions, visitations to secret dungeon rooms, business trips with secretaries, masturbation materials, coupled with *videos* of these things... I think it would *implode the world.*  But then... there might be sort of a truth renaissance, and a new kind of relationship perspective that is FAR more mature. I believe that, because I refuse to believe that more truth can degrade a thing permanently. It may change it, sure.",™

t5_2sdpm,PoppedArt,1361591036,"Every job I've had for the last eight years both contract and direct, has required a drug screening before they would hire me. All the contracts I've had to sign allow for random testing as well although I've never had one.  All but one of the pre-employment tests have been urine tests. I did have one hair test. The employer was very adamant that it had to be the hair test.  Most of the positions I've had have been with Fortune 500 companies. That may have something to do with it. Perhaps sturm09 and akhbhaat have worked for smaller privately owned companies?  Below is some stuff I found about how long you have to worry about it.  ""Some THC metabolites have an elimination half-life of 20 hours. However, some are stored in body fat and have a elimination half-life of 10 to 13 days. Most researchers agree that urine tests for marijuana can detect the presence of the drug in the body for up to 13 days.  However, there is anecdotal evidence that the length of time that marijuana remains in the body is affected by how often the person smokes, how much he smokes and how long he has been smoking. Regular smokers have reported positive drug test results after 45 days since last use and heavy smokers have reported positive tests 90 days after quitting."" [source](http://alcoholism.about.com/od/pot/a/marijuana_test.htm)  ""Q: What time period does the HairConfirm™ test cover?   A: HairConfirm™ will detect drugs for a period of 90 days. The test requires a hair sample of 1.5 inches in length. Each 0.5 inch represents 30 days. The hair sample must be cut as close to the scalp as possible and only the most recent 1.5 inches are tested."" [source](http://www.craigmedical.com/Hair_Drug-Test_FAQ.htm)",™

Irrelevant - the fact that there are men at the top at all makes it clear that the patriarchy is working.  There are more female voters than male voters?  Obviously, women have been brainwashed by the patriarchy to elect male officials.  Men aren't taken seriously when they speak up about IPV?  Everybody knows that the patriarchy hurts men, too!  Well, if men are the true brutes in our society, what about lesbian IPV?  It's so obvious - the patriarchy forces every relationship to adhere to strict gender roles!

Plan B had a 5 day window after unprotected sex.  it is not exactly true that Plan B One Step only prevents ovulation.  From the manufactures website:  How does Plan B One-Step® work?  Plan B One-Step® works in a similar way to help prevent pregnancy from happening. **It works mainly by stopping the release of an egg from the ovary.  It is possible that Plan B One-Step® may also work by preventing fertilization of an egg (the uniting of the sperm with the egg) or by preventing attachment (implantation) to the uterus (womb).**  This is also confirmed word for word by the CDC and FDA (who licenses the product).  *My concern is that if it only prevents ovulation then what if the girl has already released her egg when you have sex?*  If that is 100% true, then it will not work.   *So if you have sex just after the woman ovulates, will plan B fail?*  Again, if it only prevents ovulation, and she has ovulated already, then yes Plan B fails  *If you have sex 4 days before ovulation will this be ""too early"" for plan B to have any effect?*  If it only prevents ovulation AND has a strict 72 hour window there is a success rate of 89%. Then no, it would not be effective assuming you know exactly when she ovulated. Exactly.   However that is not exactly true either. Efficacy goes down dramatically, but there is a residual effect over 72 hours.  Would I count on that? Nope. Just like I would not count on the possibility of Plan B One step absolutely preventing implantation or fertilization because that is not how it is prescribed despite that it can work that way for some.

Part your hair in the centre. Take your elasticated head band and pull this down over the crown of your head…if you find this is slipping back up use a few bobby pins to secure the head band.  &gt;Step Two  &gt;Next you want to start at one side of your head and take the front section of hair. You need to then wrap this section of hair around the head band and pull out the ends…add some more loose hair to this to make the next section.  &gt;Step Three  &gt;Repeat step 2 all the way around the head. When you get to the last few end sections of your hair you can use some bobbypins to secure and tuck these away.  &gt;Step Four  &gt;This style looks best with some of the front sections of hair loosened as this gives a gorgeous shape to the face framing sections. To do this just gently pull on the hair to loosen from the head band. Spirtz with hairspray just to hold everything in place.

t5_2rgym,Chancholoraq,1361672477,"That can also depend on if you want these quests to be quirky and fun or part of the story itself.  For the first one, you could have random encounters which develop in front of you and be triggered by entering a certain area or talking with somebody. (This doesn't have to be a choice of dialogue option but more yes and no questions. ex: Excuse me sir, can you help me find my dog? Then you can approach the NPC and press e for yes or simply ignore the character to refuse)  For the second one you can have different quests or patrols which are optional; if you have one main story objective, maybe there can be an HQ where you can commence these quests and help the community to gain an advantage. At the same time you can get new/unique weapons, discover new places to venture and find other surprises such as: lost/abandoned squad-mates/civilians to rescue and recruit, enemy bases to take over and conquer, or maybe gather enemy intel to help in the final battle/level?  Take this as you will, maybe this can serve as my idea development portfolio!  I do have a soundcloud where I have some pieces I did for my Music composition class, but there are still rough since I didn't have a lot of time and the particular software was only available during class time. You can still take a look and I recommend listening with headphones to hear all the audio panning and underlying tones for maximum [experience!](http://soundcloud.com/chancholoraq) Outlet Mahal was a dance assignment, allowing us to choose a genre of dance music and use Logic Pro® to create it. Kotoehrusion was a minimalist piece (If you'd like to get a better idea of what it is look up Philip Glass - The Grid) and it was a response to the Philip Glass piece. The last one was a narration I did for a /r/nosleep story I wrote and I made background music for it as well. (you don't need to see that though :) If you'd like to see what I was trying to achieve with the two compositions on that soundcloud then I can PM you my reflective statements!  However, I'd rather make a personal portfolio for you under your guidelines and stipulations: genre, instruments, mood, and the general ""theme"" of the music *you* want. I'm very flexible and can record live instruments or use electronic/simulated instruments to push the boundaries a bit. I play guitar, piano, drums, and I own some woodwind instruments that are fun to mess around with. I have a lot of musical ideas in mind that I can show you, but it's easier for me to know what I exactly have to produce.  I guess you can call this an application of sorts, but it's unfinished until you tell me what type of music you want to have in your game! If you'd like you can show me some examples of songs you know that can reflect some of the sounds you have in mind or you can tell me about the general mood and atmosphere of the game so it is easier to properly depict and translate the environment into music. I can also help you with sound effects and such: gun sounds, voices (reacting/speaking), general ambient noises to surround the player, or anything else you have in mind.  I know this is pretty long and I probably should have PM'd you this but what the hell; by the way, this is a pretty awesome project you have here and I'd love to be a part of it!  EDIT: words",®

t5_2qhh7,chemequilibrium,1361673262,"They aren't saying ""we need to redefine 'fag',"" they're saying that it doesn't mean ""gay person I don't like"" anymore.  I'm gonna be honest, I *really* don't like linguistic equality movements. I had a teacher in high school who would brag about her accomplishments in feminism. She believed that until her work in the 80s, the word ""woman"" was used exclusively to refer to prostitutes. She would pick her words so carefully, and follow every little trend in Newspeak that eventually I wasn't sure if she even knew what she was saying anymore. In the end, her hyper-awareness of gender and race made her come off as a bigot.  My view is that we should stop caring what it means, because ""taking back the word!™"" ultimately does nothing but ingrain the word in peoples' vocabulary. The English language is fluid, and often we just end up giving more power to hateful words or shifting the burden to some other unfortunate group. Today, the only people who use ""faggot"" use it with the intent to mock or distance themselves from someone. After 60 years of civil rights movements, look how ""nigger"" is still used - to mock and distance. It doesn't change, its use just becomes less frequent, and using it ironically as a friendly term really doesn't do much for anyone. Basically, I don't want to see the LGBT community greeting each other with ""What's up, faggot?"" because that's below us.",™

Me being black does not automatically mean I'm going to trash the house, thus lowering its resale value and the property value of the neighborhood. Or that I will trespass on your property to play in your pool and then sue when I'm injured. Nor does it mean I'm going to roam the streets at 3AM, teepeeing houses, harassing the neighbors' pets, playing on neighbors' properties, or other annoying and destructive shit that you see from families with kids. Especially nowadays when any sort of discipline is tantamount to abuse.  So like other people have said, you have to find ways around it. I would love to build a community of one-bedroom cottages. Not all childless/childfree/empty-nesters want or need a large house with multiple bedrooms and most areas have laws that you can't have more than two people to a bedroom in any sort of dwelling. It would have a dog park, maybe a pool that can only be used by the residents, a clubhouse, and foster a sense of neighborly community without any parents taking advantage of The Village™. A community garden where everybody puts in the work and everybody can enjoy its fruits (and vegetables and herbs).

t5_2uuwv,DedicatedAcct,1361728199,"&gt;What exactly do you mean by ''honorary women'' then?  An honorary position is given as an honor, with no duties attached, and without payment.  Women are generally accepted to have female sex organs, be more in touch with their feelings, and have a slightly smaller frame than men. Women are typically capable of giving birth, though older women who have gone through Menopause, some intersex women, and transgender women are not. The symbol for the planet Venus is the sign also used in biology for the female sex. It is a stylized representation of the goddess Venus's hand-mirror or an abstract symbol for the goddess: a circle with a small equilateral cross underneath (♀). The Venus symbol also represented femininity, and in ancient alchemy stood for copper. Alchemists constructed the symbol from a circle (representing spirit) above an equilateral cross (representing matter).  Would you like to know more? ",♀
t5_2uvah,idioma,1361728851,"&gt; I'm not sure what the 1994 AWB has to do with the current discussion of the second amendment and the rights it conveys.  This is what you said:  &gt; The threat of tyranny is the same today as it has ever been. Keeping military arms means that the people always have the ultimate final recourse to oppression.  Again, I ask you: What freedom was left up for grabs (and subsequently snatched) which would have otherwise been spared if not for the 1994 AWB?  What gun control law has been passed thus far which resulted in the United States being subjected to tyranny? Because the pattern I'm seeing is this:  A bunch of assholes with military-grade weapons go to a public place and start shooting. An outraged public discovers that these weapons can be mail-ordered from a catalogue or picked up from a pawn shop for a few hundred bucks. Some politicians are given mandate by their constituents to fix this, and draft legislation to restrict the sales of said weapons.  Next, the NRA accuses these politicians of bringing about the total destruction of America, apple pie, freedom, etc. and spams a bunch of gun owners, begging them for some money to ""fight for freedom!""™  The some watered-down bill passes, and all of those fears dissolve into a bunch of grown men throwing tantrums when they have to wait a few days before getting a new toy.  &gt; Um, I think you are misinformed about the 1994 AWB.  During the 1994 AWB, several states adopted bans on high-capacity magazines. The NRA spit and howled about the ban and warned people about the coming tyranny. They called federal agents Jackbooted Thugs and even George H.W. Bush decided to distance himself from the NRA (and resigned his lifetime membership in response to the ""Jackbooted Thugs"" comment).  &gt; I bought my first assault rifle because of and during the AWB. It was a civilian version of the AK-47, and accepts high capacity magazines. I bought it new. The new manufacture of high capacity magazines was halted, but there were so many already in circulation that all it did was raise prices a little bit. I bought 6 high capacity magazines for my AK during the AWB.  This sounds like a confession to me. You are admitting that your precious freedoms weren't really trampled on, and that it was only a cosmetic difference for you in the end. No black helicopters or FEMA death camps? Really? So you just had to buy used magazines? How awful.",™

Plus by then Shizune will be Stonking Rich™ and can easily jet over whenever she feels like it. :P  I would say that the friendship between Hisao and Misha specifically is one of the things you can maybe criticize about the way A22 wrote it.

t5_2ud8h,Clbull,1361735037,"Go for the following:  * Final Fantasy XIII-2 (360/PS3) - It was a massive improvement on the first game but you may want to read up on the first one's story to not get confused, as it was the direct sequel to a pretty lackluster game.  * Path of Exile (PC) - Amazing customisation and gear upgrading. It's also got linearish progression but gives you the freedom to clear everything on the map or go straight for the exit. Sadly, it sorta lacks in the narrative department and if you didn't like Diablo II then you will hate this game. Also, it's online only but free to play.  * Blue Dragon (360) - It was from the producer of Final Fantasy (Hironobu Sakaguchi) and apparently it wasn't that bad a game.  * Final Fantasy X (PS3) - It will come out on PS3 and PSVita soon.™ If you ever want to revisit one of the better Final Fantasy titles then this enhanced HD port might be up your street. Thing is, release date unknown.  * Losy Odyssey (360) - I honestly found the characters in the game and the game world uninspiring and boring but on the plus side it's another Hironobu Sakaguchi (a.k.a. Final Fantasy producer) created game. There are difficulty spikes at times and the game requires a lot of grinding. Maybe I didn't give it enough of a chance.  * Chrono Trigger DS (DS) - If you have never played Chrono Trigger before, either you are European (and have hence not seen a CT title release until 2010) and hate pirating ROMs, don't like turn based JRPGs, or are naive. The DS port features a monster battle arena similar to Pokémon that gives you an alternative way to get great items and a brand new dungeon/ending for the game.  * Kingdom Hearts Re:Coded (DS) - Out of all the oversaturated shitty spinoff titles that have spoiled the critically acclaimed Kingdom Hearts series (Note to SquareEnix: ANNOUNCE KINGDOM HEARTS 3 ALREADY), Re:Coded is actually quite fun and feels like a genuine Kingdom Hearts game with sidequests long after the main story is cleared.. I would honestly recommend playing KH and KH2 on the PS2 though but that depends on if you still have a PS2 lying around.  * Legend of Dragoon (PSN) -  LoD was a really good PS1 Final Fantasy clone that had true potential to become a good series and had a bit of a cult following. Unfortunately, plans for a sequel were cancelled. It was released on Playstation Network.",™

t5_2qh2p,Dudesan,1361807907,"I've heard many christians claim that there's a distinction between ""moral, civil, and ceremonial laws"", but not one *has ever* been able to give me a straight answer about how they tell the difference between the three. It's clearly about what they find personally distasteful or silly, but admitting that that was the case would rather undermine their positions, so don't expect them to admit it. Apart from a few commands which were explicitly intended for a specific people at a specific time, there is absolutely nothing to indicate that most of these laws weren't supposed to be binding for everyone for all time. Indeed, in many places (See Leviticus 23:21, or 1 Samuel 15:29, for example), it's explicitly stated that they *are*.  Remember, many Christians find it more comfortable to believe in a god who doesn't condone, command or commit murder, slavery, rape, child abuse, animal abuse, arson, torture, ritual mutilation, fratricide, patricide, matricide, infanticide, genocide, and so on than to believe in one who does.   Unfortunately, since the Bible (Old Testamant and New) is pretty clear about Yahweh's position on these things, holding a belief in Loving Hippie Jesus™ requires ignoring huge portions of it. Or just never reading it in the first place, which seems to be the most popular option.  Well, let's see what Jesus has to say about that:  &gt;“Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished.  (Matthew 5:17-18, NIV)  Some Christians claim that his death and resurrection ""fulfill"" this. That is bullshit for one simple reason: last time I checked, Heaven and Earth haven't passed away.  Jesus also made his views on people ""picking and choosing"" quite clear:  &gt;[Jesus] answered them, “And why do you break God’s commandment because of your tradition? For God said:    *Honor your father and your mother;* and, *The one who speaks evil of father or mother must be put to death.*  &gt; But you say, ‘Whoever tells his father or mother, “Whatever benefit you might have received from me is a gift committed to the temple”—  he does not have to honor his father.’ In this way, you have revoked God’s word because of your tradition. Hypocrites! Isaiah prophesied correctly about you when he said:    &gt;These people honor Me with their lips, but their heart is far from Me.  They worship Me in vain, teaching as doctrines the commands of men.”  (Matthew 15:3-9, NIV)   Looks like Jesus has quite a bit to say about people who ignore commandments, in fact. But maybe it's just Matthew?  &gt;It is easier for heaven and earth to disappear than for the least stroke of a pen to drop out of the Law.  (Luke 16:17, NIV)  Okay, so Jesus is a bust. Let's see what the Epistles have to say about the Mosaic Code:  &gt; If you really keep the royal law found in Scripture, “Love your neighbor as yourself,” you are doing right.  But if you show favoritism, you sin and are convicted by the law as lawbreakers. For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it.   (James 2:8-10, NIV)  &gt;All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness,  (2 Timothy 3:16)  &gt;Do we, then, nullify the law by this faith? Not at all! Rather, we uphold the law.  (Romans 3:31)  &gt;Know this first of all, that *there is no prophecy of scripture that is a matter of personal interpretation*, for no prophecy ever came through human will; but rather human beings moved by the holy Spirit spoke under the influence of God.""  (2 Peter 1:20-21 NAB)  ----  See also:  &gt;Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever.   Hebrews 13:8  &gt;Every good thing given and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, **with whom there is no variation**  or shifting shadow.  James 1:17  &gt;God is not a man, that he should lie, nor a son of man, that he should change his mind. Does he speak and then not act? Does he promise and not fulfill?  Numbers 23:19  &gt;He who is the Glory of Israel does not lie or change his mind; for he is not a man, that he should change his mind.""  1 Samuel 15:29  &gt; For I testify to everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: If anyone adds to these things, God will add to him the plagues that are written in this book; and if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part from the Book of Life, from the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book.

I ended up showing it to one of my friends whose  grandmother and her siblings were on the last kindertransport from Czechoslovakia. They all went to Manchester on yeshiva sponsorships and the like and went on to raise families of their own. Her mind was blown by the clip, so she searched for 'Winston's List' and actually FOUND her great aunt's name (who had sadly cut off all ties with Jews following the war and  is now deceased) on the list of children whose whereabouts remained unknown and weren't successfully contacted. Her family is now probably going to write to inform them of her survival and passing.   That is some amazing stuff. Thanks so much for posting it 😊",😊

Exfoliate once a week or every 10 days maximum. Some people, like my sister, exfoliate more often but her face doesn't become a piece of fucking sandpaper after a while. Use a light moisturizer at night. I use straight up vaseline, but he likes this fancy stuff from LUSH for his face at night. I can ask him about the specific product name. For the rest of the body Dove soap and Cetaphil lotion seems to be pretty good.   I try to get him to use a moisturizing sunscreen on his face in the morning but ""it feels like makeup"" to him.

t5_2qh2p,Snoopy101x,1361837412,"First and foremost the burden of proof falls on the one making the claim. As atheist we do not claim anything other than we do not believe in a god or gods. That's it, all we say is without factual evidence to prove god exists we believe he doesn't. Also something to point is how he words each of these statements.  1. ""The Bible, in totality, is not fictional"" -- does this negative statement carry a burden of proof? Not quiet sure how this is a negative statement. The claim here is that the bible is factual and yes this statement carries a burden of proof.  2. ""It's not possible to refute the facts of Theism"" -- does this negative statement carry a burden of proof? Don't know why he keeps using ""this negative statement"" when not all of his statements are positive or negative, but anyways. The claim here is that there are ""facts"" to theism. Without proof of your theistic god, you have no facts.  3. ""Theism is not a delusion, a lie, or a flawed worldview"" -- does this negative statement carry a burden of proof? To be fair, all these statements carry a burden of proof to them. This one we can prove to some extent. Simply by looking at it from another perspective such as, a small group believes in the invisible pink unicorn. One can simply state that without evidence of this invisible pink unicorn that everyone in this group is delusional, living a lie, and has a flawed worldview.   4. ""God's factual appearance and activities are not imaginary"" -- does this negative statement carry a burden of proof? Burden of proof is there needs to be evidence of ""god's factual appearance and activities"".  5. ""The statements of Theism carry no burden of proof"" -- does this negative statement carry a burden of proof? This statement is just flawed within itself. Claiming something has no burden of proof then asking if it does is just asinine. Regardless of that fact, yes there is a burden of proof to theism to prove itself.  6. ""Evolution THEORY™ has no scientific evidence in its favor"" -- does this negative statement carry a burden of proof? Yes this does carry a burden of proof, but we have the evidence for it. Simple google search can show this. Also look up the definition of scientific theory, law, and fact.  7. ""All statements the atheist makes are not true"" -- does this negative statement carry a burden of proof? This is one of those ""I always lie"" scenarios. But still this requires proof. You have to prove that all atheists all over the planet are always lying. While it's pretty safe to say that ya, we all lie every now and then, to make the claim **ALL** statements we make are not true, is just a little overboard.  8. ""All who agree with atheism are not rational"" -- does this negative statement carry a burden of proof? What proof is there for this statement? The same can be said for all theists. At least for theists there is quite a bit of evidence to prove that statement.   9. ""The atheist's IQ is no higher than that of the lower animal"" -- does this negative statement carry a burden﻿ of proof? To prove this, you'd have to show that atheist's are not capable of making rational or coherent thoughts, we lack higher verbal communication, all we do is eat, sleep, and shit. Now this may account for a few of us, I doubt it does for all of us.  10. ""All who agree with atheism do not deserve to continue living"" -- does this negative statement carry a burden of proof? This is like saying all who believe in what I believe do not deserve to live. The burden of proof is heavy in this one. You'd have to prove without a shadow of a doubt why atheist do not deserve to live.",™

Banks consistently extend more credit than they have cash. Banking is 100% trust based.  If all of the banks customers were to go in and demand all their cash at once banks would be in trouble. When you withdraw they pay you from the reserve.   ""So how do banks make money?"" Banks make money on your trust. You leave your money for them to loan out to others. When they loan out your money they trust people will repay them with a say 5% interest.   Since you trusted the bank with your money the take ~.003% of the amount you trusted with them and pay you back.    So imagine 1000 people all deposit $100 into First National Bank of Kubaki®. I keep $10000 in my reserve estimating that not all of the people that deposited will need that right away.

t5_2rcd1,quantizedd,1361853661,"The [Abbot Xtra](https://www.abbottdiabetescare.com/products/patient/pxtra-overview.html) has been shown to accurately and reliably test for beta-hydroxybutyrate, but I can't say I've ever seen it used since DKA is pretty characteristic on typical bloodwork. AFAIK, it is the only point of care method for measuring this value though (although I could always be wrong).  &gt;Point-of-care β-hydroxybutyrate measurement for the diagnosis of feline diabetic ketoacidaemia. J Small Anim Pract. June 2012;53(6):328-31. F K Zeugswetter1; L Rebuzzi 1Clinical Department for Small Animals and Horses, University of Veterinary Medicine, Veterinaerplatz 1, Vienna, Austria. © 2012 British Small Animal Veterinary Association. Companion Notes Article Abstract  &gt;OBJECTIVES: To evaluate accuracy and precision of a hand-held ketone meter measuring β-hydroxybutyrate and to determine its diagnostic performance to rule out ketoacidaemia in diabetic cats.  &gt;METHODS: The ketone meter was validated by calculating within-day precision at different β-hydroxybutyrate concentrations and by comparison with a laboratory method. To determine its diagnostic performance to diagnose ketoacidaemia, 217 sets of data (venous blood gas analysis and β-hydroxybutyrate measurements) were retrospectively analysed. Sensitivities and specificities were calculated with the help of receiver-operating characteristic curves.  &gt;RESULTS: The ketone meter reliably detected β-hydroxybutyrate at concentrations &gt;0·1 mmol/L and reproducibility was acceptable. Measurements highly correlated with laboratory results (r=0·97; P&lt;0·001), but a significant negative bias was found at high concentrations. A β-hydroxybutyrate concentration of &gt;2·55 mmol/L had a sensitivity of 94% and a specificity of 68% for diagnosing ketoacidaemia. Many cats with high β-hydroxybutyrate concentrations and normal blood pH had an elevated chloride gap suggestive of superimposed hypochloraemic metabolic alkalosis.  &gt;CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The commercially available point-of-care ketone meter Precision Xtra is a valid tool to measure β-hydroxybutyrate in diabetic cats. Concentration &lt;2·55 mmol/L enable ketoacidaemia to be excluded and should lead to redirection of differential diagnoses. ",©

Sure it  MAY start, it also may not and could cause injector damage. Ethanol in fuel goes bad quickly, on the order of just a few weeks. http://usafuelservice.com/ethanolbasics.htm "" Ethanol fuel users storing fuel more than 60 days should use a premium fuel stabilizer such as “GAS-SHOK”™ or expect to have the tank and fuel cleaned annually. (Boats, RV’s, emergency generators, Etc)  Ethanol fuels will absorb significant water right out of the air if stored 60 days or longer.  ""  You stored for double that time, in the winter. Replace your fuel.  Moisture also builds up in the engine. Engines are NOT sealed units. They all have a breather hose to vent crankcase gasses. Moisture will get into these areas and get into the engine.   Once fuel is replaced, run the bike for 30 minutes or so, till things are good and warmed up to burn off as much moisture as possible. Be easy on it during this time. After it cools, if your oil is really dark or smells really strange, change it. Oil is cheap, a motor is not.  Empty all air from the tires. Concrete is bad for tires when it is cold out. Flat tires will allow you to easily check for cracks in the sidewalls. Very minor cracking is no big deal but you may want to consider replacing the tire if it has deep cracks in it.  May as well check coolant at this time too, just to make sure it is decently clean and full.",™

t5_2qh33,highguy420,1361902253,"I believe reddit has many algorithms they don't disclose in their open-source version of the code.  I know they mess with the votes and the order of the stories quite a bit for ""fairness"" but I don't have any evidence that they group the stories by any other means than your choice.    They cache almost everything.  If they can take 99% of the users and group their subreddit selections together into many smaller groups and pre-render all of those pageviews they reduce the CPU consumption of the site significantly.    So if you and I have the same subreddit subscriptions our entire catalog of reddit pages is pre-rendered and have a hash associated with them (notice the after=XXXX hash in the ""next"" link, it's not related to any story but the page of submissions you are currently on).  But it is exceedingly rare for two people to have *exactly* the same list of subscriptions, so they cheat.  They only include a subset of your subreddits (100 I think) and by doing so they create an environment where many more users' subscriptions line up.  They can pre-render pageviews for the majority of users, especially those who have mostly mainstream views and subscriptions.    The side effect of this is that you and I will frequently have the same 100 subreddits selected and we will frequently be grouped together because of our own actions, and a mechanism that saves reddit money on their Amazon.com^® EC3℠ bill.    You are just perceiving the failures of a pseudo-random process.  Randomness is expensive when it comes to deterministic machines such as computers and reddit isn't willing to pay for it.  They group us together to aggregate computation, using a metric wherein we provide the evidence of our ideology to them freely and intentionally *for the express purpose of being aggregated with others who share the same ideology*.    To put it another way, this less crazy as Netflix^® suggesting a movie you might like because in this case you *told reddit what you are interested in and asked them to include you in those communities with others of the same interest*.  They are not analyzing your interests, you told them whom you wish to be grouped with, and they did.  Source: I subscribe to /r/blog and read the things the admins say about reddit.",®

t5_2snuc,ConclusivePostscript,1361912613,"&gt; [That there is no “congruent single version” of God still does not entail that there is no God] Strawman.  You yourself said that religious disagreements are “an excellent argument against theism. None of you can agree with yourselves... at all.” So how is what I said a strawman? Is it because I said “entail” (implying a deductive argument), whereas you are proposing an inductive or abductive argument?  &gt; Common attributes don't equal same.  Wrong, common attributes *could* refer to different aspects of the same being, but *might not*. Both options are still open, since (as I have been arguing) there is no logical entailment from mere disagreement to either one being right or all of them being wrong. Perhaps one is right, perhaps none are right, but perhaps all or most are *partially* right.  &gt; What about the others? Oops. Kind of runs afoul of your claim they all believe the same thing doesn't it?  That wasn’t the claim I made. *Nowhere* did I say that they all believe the same thing. I said many or most of them, perhaps even all of them, have *some* of the truth about God (or Ultimate Reality, or whatever you wish to call it). I said explicitly: Perhaps there is a God who possesses some, many, or all of these attributes, while lacking other less common ones. (*Who* has trouble listening?)  &gt; Irrelevant opinion. Also called special pleading, for trying to make special exception for the commonality you like. Still doesn't do a thing.  Since more religious traditions agree on God’s creation of everything than agree concerning lightning, this is hardly special pleading.  &gt; Irrelevant. Also, wrong, depending upon which deist you ask, because deist doesn't make very many specific claims at all. A deist could believe in a god that lacks them all yet only created the universe.  I’m referring primarily to classical deists (Thomas Hobbes, for instance), who admittedly exhibit less diversity than your Contemporary Internet Deist™. I’m well aware that many deists today make fewer claims about the attributes of God beyond his being Creator, but that attribute logically requires the possession of other attributes, if for no other reason than explanatory exigency (i.e., the deist must explain how it is that God has that creative capacity).  &gt; *These are marks* **against** *you.*  So what you’re telling me is that…you’re off your meds? Can you talk a little louder, please? It makes you seem more respectable and persuasive. Why not even use caps lock? Surely everyone will upvote you.  &gt; ... some forms of deism are forms of classical theism. So... no, classical theism doesn't ""just go a step further"".  In that case, you’ve actually just made my point stronger. Some forms of deism are identical to some forms of classical theism.  &gt; It's my version, because I'm not accepting any pathetic setup example that is easily shown to be complete shit, like this elephant parable.  In the context of understanding the way religions understand their relation to other religions, the traditional versions are more important than your own. Incidentally, you also never addressed my human example. (“People have very different concepts of other specific human beings, too, but you don’t seem anyone coming along and saying, ‘Well maybe that person *doesn’t exist in the first place!*’ ”)  &gt; Oh, but I thought all religions have the SAME main attributes!  I only indicated that *many* religions have *some* of the same attributes. For someone who claims I’m not listening, you sure have a listening problem yourself.  &gt; Oh no! That must mean it's A PERFECT AND BEYOND CRITICISM! How dare I rip it to pieces.  Oh, well good. You’re using caps lock now. I fully agree with everything you say now. But seriously. I didn’t say it was perfect or that it was beyond criticism. It is simply a helpful way to understand how individuals might have experience of the same basic reality despite apparent disagreements. Since it is merely a story, it does not have argumentative validity. It is a picture, an analogy. The fact that you are taking such strong issue with it shows you’re misunderstanding the force I think it has. I have not argued that it shows that there actually *is* a God, etc., but that it’s *conceivable* that God exists and is experienced in diverse ways. You have yet to provide an actual *argument* for the contrary, deductive, inductive, abductive or otherwise. For someone who claims we have a need to argue for our position, you haven’t done a very good job arguing for your original assertion.  &gt; Your mistaking the generality here.  And you’re misspelling “you’re” here.  &gt; YOU want specifics, so ask a specific scenario. If you ask a general question, you are again going to get a general answer. Simple, no?  Is it logically possible, or is it not, that there are a *few* religions that have *most* of the truth about God, *some* that have *much* of the truth, *many* that have only *some* of the truth, and *few to none* that have zero truth about God? If this is possible, is it improbable? Why do you think so?  &gt; No, there aren't. There are varies modes of learning, as you pointed out. Logic is the study of those modes. There isn't various conceptions of it.  I think you mean “various” and “aren’t.” In any case, you aren’t a logician, and the views of actual logicians have greater authority than your own baseless assertions. The claims I made are supported by actual logicians and logical writers throughout the history of logic, as well as historians of philosophy in general. These writers have different conceptions of what logic is, how it works, and where it is located in the matrix of human knowledge. Frege’s conception of logic differs from Peirce’s. Peirce’s conception of logic differs from Aristotle’s. And so on. I know perfectly well what I’m talking about, as I have studied logic well enough to make authoritative claims about it. You, on the other hand, are not supporting your argument with knowledge from the history of logic or from contemporary logicians.  &gt; Semantics.  The disagreements are not merely verbal. Whether something is or is not an art, and whether something is or is not a science, is objectively decidable.  &gt; It still doesn't exist. It's an abstract concept.  That something is abstract doesn’t mean it does not exist. It means that its form of existence is abstract, not concrete. Logic clearly exists, insofar as we use it to reason.",™

t5_2uczz,GuyWithNoHat,1361916031,"My wife is able to enjoy anal immensely under the right circumstances.  Psychologically, it probably helps if you're insanely turned on from either kissing, neck nuzzling, touching, etc.  My wife seems to do much better if she's already had an orgasm or two, because then her body is ready for *more*.  Then we dial it back a bit by adding some lube, and then finger play.  After a little bit of that, I just press my cock up to her ass.  I've found an excellent way to do this is with me sitting on our couch, and her on all fours in front of me (the height is right and comfortable for both of us).  Here's the **important part**: I do not push into her.  She *slowly* backs into me.  Anal is never an activity where you both can just thrust your brains out, or you will have a **bad time™**.  One of the most pleasurable parts for both of us, is when I have finally *sunk* all the way into her.  We like to hold this position, which helps her to relax and loosen up to a point where movement is ""possible"" (i.e. without pain).  On my side, it is very pleasurable, even just barely moving -- as I can feel every little movement.  With me buried in her ass and her holding still, she begins to touch herself which gets things moving a little bit faster, and we both begin to enjoy ourselves immensely.  **TL;DR:** Never rush anal.  Let the woman control the penetration.  Use lube.  Stay fully inserted for a short time (1-4 minutes, whatever is acceptable for you) to acclimate to the sensations/control-the-discomfort.  Please yourself so that your body gets a little distracted with what's up front, allowing your body to relax and enjoy (secondarily) what's going on in the back.",™

t5_2qmdf,robspeaks,1361937153,"© December 29, 2006 By Fred kirsch The Virginian-Pilot  NORFOLK — Buddy Holland’s life could be divided into two neat, almost equal chapters.  “There wasn’t anything he didn’t do,” Shelley Taylor, his fiancee, said of Buddy’s younger years.  Holland, who died Dec. 19 at age 70 of a heart attack, was pumping gas, changing oil and getting under the hood of cars at his father’s gas station when he was barely 10.  He wasn’t even a teenager when he was tooling around town in his own new car.  “He never did get caught for not having a license because his dad knew all the cops,” Taylor said.  At 15, Holland and girlfriend Jeannie ran off to get married. The authorities caught up with the couple somewhere in Tennessee before they tied the knot. With their parents’ consent, they married soon after.  As a young man, Holland’s passion was whipping around local dirt race tracks driving his No. 51 stock car, winning his share of races and partying into the wee hours afterward.  Holland, whose given name was Edward, always looked ready for a party. He was a handsome, thin guy with “the bluest eyes” and a head of dark hair that always held a dash or two of Brylcreem.  Then, in the mid-1970s, he found the Lord. The partying and the racing stopped.  But one thing remained the same. “There wasn’t anyone who didn’t like Buddy,” longtime friend Dee Larch said.  Holland began attending Tidewater Gospel Church, became the chief mechanic at Kline Chevrolet and then a supervisor. Later, he owned a boat repair business with the motto “We Fix It All.”  Holland, like always, was the guy at the center of the action, but the good times became sitting around in his shop playing country western on his guitar with good buddies and fishing with his family.  “He reached out to everyone,” said his oldest son, Edward Paul Holland. “We were always taking in people who were down on their luck. I can’t recall all the people who lived with us.” Several he raised as his own.  He and Jeannie had been married for 51 years when she died several years ago.  The past three years he was devoted to Taylor, a nurse and church music director he had met on visits to the doctor’s office.  Said Taylor, with a laugh: “Underneath, he was the same guy, but I don’t know if we would have gotten together had I known him back then.”",©

t5_2rww2,TheSmilingGirl,1361941742,"Hey. I am on a SSRI and before I started taking them. I was against them too (Kinda). Then I read an article about having depression and other mental illnesses. It really opened my eyes to why people should feel okay with taking meds.   Think of it this way, mental illness usually is your brain sending you the wrong signals, or chemicals not working the way they should.   If someone starts losing their sight, they get glasses to help them see. If someone gets diabetes it's in their best interest to take medicines and do other things to help their body deal with it. Glasses, and diabetes are two examples of the body not working like it should. It's totally fine for these people to take meds and wear glasses to be similar to the average person. It was my Eureka! moment.    Now that I have found a SSRI that works for me, life is wonderful. I can function like the average person. It's not medicine that makes you happy all the time, it has helped me understand that my brain just doesn't work properly. It's not your fault, and taking medicine won't change who you are. If SSRI's could help I would recommend trying it. ♥   ",♥

t5_2qh5b,cabbagery,1361944075,"&gt; [D]oes [imprisoning a creature] stop being immoral once they aren't cognisant of the imprisonment?  It stops being imprisonment. The moral status of the captivity in question depends on other factors, of course, but if a captive creature is unaware of its captivity, then it is no longer meaningfully imprisoned (or so I argue).  &gt; If you replaced the word ""freeman"" with ""hamster,"" does that make the line of thinking any different?  I'm not sure how to answer this. The new statement would be as follows:  &gt; &gt; If I believe I am a [hamster] (and know what it means, and prefer as much), then irrespective of my ignorance, I am a [hamster].  Obviously, I am not actually a hamster just for believing as much, and perhaps my statement needs minor revision to flesh things out more clearly. I admit I'm struggling to come up with an articulation I like, but the gist is that some labels are self-applied, and despite certain external (read: objective) factors which may apparently disqualify me for the label(s) in question, self-applying such a label is in some meaningful sense sufficient for me to *be* a member of that labeled class. Consider the label 'Christian'; a Roman Catholic presumably identifies herself as a 'Christian,' yet certain Protestants would deny her that label, basing their opinion on Protestant doctrines which exclude Roman Catholics -- is it appropriate to deny our Catholic her self-identification? Is she a True Christian®? I expect something similar is happening with the label 'prisoner,' or the status of 'being imprisoned.' If a person does not self-identify as a prisoner, then from that person's perspective, *she is not a prisoner*. If you would insist that this may also mean she's deluded, then I'll bite that bullet. I have no qualms with the fact that many persons who are in fact imprisoned are oblivious to that fact, but the point here is that if a person does not know she is imprisoned (or denies it), then to 'free' her is an impotent gesture. To wit, if you have to convince someone they are imprisoned before they can be freed, then until they are so convinced your efforts to free them will be wasted.  How can one free a prisoner who insists she is already free?  &gt; What freedom do you have if you were genetically programmed or indoctrinated into a specific role?  That's a fantastic question. I suspect you have no true freedom at all in such a case, but if you are unaware of the fact that you are 'imprisoned,' then setting you free is a hollow endeavor.  &gt; I actually believe pet ownership is imprisonment in most cases.  Clearly it is, on a bare reading of 'imprisonment.' Also imprisoned are children, the infirm, the mentally handicapped, etc.  &gt; Unfortunately for cats and dogs, it's far too late to change anything.  I don't see how that is the case at all. If owning domesticated animals is imprisonment, and if imprisonment of this sort is morally impermissible, then at the very least we can cease doing it. This raises other questions, however, concerning e.g. the moral status of spaying or neutering animals.  I won't concern myself with the domestication of bears, but I'm not particularly worried -- if an animal lives a better live in human captivity than it would have otherwise, then its life is clearly better. If it is later slaughtered for human consumption, the question hinges on whether the manner in which it is slaughtered is 'humane,' and whether the life it was allowed is in fact better than a life it might otherwise have experienced.  &gt; [W]hy is it okay [to own] pets that have already been domesticated?  I cannot answer. Is it okay? Is it okay to pen animals for draft purposes, or for shearing so that we may make clothing? Is it okay to train animals to be used as companions for the blind or persons susceptible to seizures? None of these things seems particularly worrisome, but I'm open to hearing just why they might be seen as objectionable.",®

t5_2r9po,Lemir,1361972798,"Martin, Izzy, et al:  Firstoff, thank you for being willing to come out and have a serious discussion with your playerbase. That’s one of the major positives that has set ANet in another class compared to many of the games and developer experiences my guild and I have had over the past decade plus.  However, I’d just like to calmly and quietly drop a friendly reminder about incentive structures and their impact on the game environment, the social dynamics of the game world, and destructive consequences that can come from poorly designed incentive structures.  **This is a long, analytical post. My goal in making it is to shed some light on structural problems and more importantly the perceptions of stakeholders that have been overlooked. My intent is to take both ANET and the players of this gaming community seriously not because I like hearing myself talk, but because I believe there’s something here that’s worth fighting for, and that we’re facing a problem that can’t be fixed without some in-depth analysis and thought.**  I have been the GM of the same small guild of four IRL friends who have known each other for now over twenty years, including at least seven different MMOs over the past decade.  I also do real-life work on large scale incentive structure and policy design (hey, who says gamers can’t be smart, right?) and just wanted to quietly drop a couple of friendly warnings about some things I’m now observing ANet coming out and doing in this latest patch.  When you’re designing incentive structures for large groups of people in competitive environments, which all MMOs are, one of the things that it’s crucial to do is make sure several people on the design team are able to put on their “economist” hats and think about how the people interacting with that incentive structure are going to behave in order to narrowly maximize rewards for the absolutely lowest amount of effort possible. This is what folks will do; it’s common sense and basic policy design. At the same time, it’s also crucial to have people in the same room wearing their “equity and human dignity” hats and thinking about whether this min/maxing behavior is going to break anything: legal systems, social systems, etc. Finally, you also must have someone in the room with their eye on the bigger picture of what you’re trying to accomplish not just in terms of the narrow intervention, but its impact on the broader picture.  For the first time observing this game evolve, I’m concerned that all three of those sets of people were not present at the table.  In concrete terms, here is what I’m observing:  ***Problem One: This Mechanic Has Created Unfair-Feeling “Classes” of Guilds***  The new “Guild Missions” system has been rolled out and advertised primarily, on ANet’s end, as a way to (a) allow guilds to be play-relevant, (b) allow large numbers of people to play together in organized, coherent ways, © provide a dump for large amounts of existing guild influence in large/wealthy guilds, and (d) provide a series of long-term goals for guilds generically to work for.  As a general design strategy, this looks clean and efficient, because it provides content for a missing chunk, creates long term goals, and allows people to play together.  Here’s the problem with this analysis: nobody put their “economist” cap on and considered what actual behaviors would result from this given reward-maximizing and absolute-effort-minimizing behavior. To summarize, here is what players will actually do as a result of this system, including the reasoning behind it:  (1) Players will attempt to access this new content as rapidly as possible. People play games to access content.  (2) Rapidly accessing the content will require large amounts of influence quickly.  (3) Because there is no per capita/per player check or mechanic baked into the system, there is an instant inequity created between large guilds (who have the influence bankroll to immediately begin researching and working on this content) compared to medium and particularly small guilds, including mine which consists of four players, which will not see that kind of influence for a very long time.  (4) This creates a blatant situation where some people are able to access content and some are not.  (5) This creates feelings of (i) anger over the unfairness, (ii) a sense that players need to choose between their friends and accessing content, (iii) a sense that small guilds are not acceptable, (iv) a sense that small guilds are not viable, leadin to (v) small guilds rapidly being emptied or broken up, (vi) and many players abandoning their guilds to join larger ones.  It is crucial for MMO developers to understand that their games live or die by access to content and the long-standing social interactions formed. (post 1/4)     Unfortunately, a simple mechanic added to the game to foster feelings of guild cohesiveness, because it was not run past people with their “economist” hats on who could recognize that people can, will, and always have maximized rewards for absolute minimum effort and thought through what this means for their incentive structure design.  It’s crucial to understand that this is not a cynical argument; it’s a practical common-sense amoral point. Translated into the context of having fun in an MMO, it runs like this: ""If another player can get access to the same content or accomplishment for less effort than me, or faster than me, or if it seems impossible that I will ever see it whereas others can by virtue of some random different variable like guild size will have access to it tomorrow, **I feel like I’m a second-class citizen, that this isn’t fair, and that I’m not having fun.** "" It’s important to recognize that this is not just an entirely reasonable and valid sentinment, but that the fact it’s appearing means something in the macro-level structure of the game environment and its driving incentive structures has gone horribly wrong.  Summary: - This mechanic has created a spectrum of guilds where the larger, the easier it is to access the content, and the smaller, the less easy it is to access the content. - This feels like a “haves”/“have nots” system. This is not fun and it is not fair. Many people play MMOs to get away from dealing with this system in real life. It has no place in a fun game world.  - Many MMOs have died because developers have refused to deal with the “haves/have nots” problem in useful ways. Until this patch, GW2 did not have this problem. - Practically, this is because of differences in guild size (how much influence can your guild create per week) compared to content unlock requirements (which are static across all guild sizes.) - Players in small guilds are encouraged to leave small guilds and join large ones. - Putting this pressure of “Do I want to be effective but leave my friends, or stick with my friends but be ineffective” is a burden that unfairly falls ONLY on players in small guilds.  - Players in large guilds do not have to make this tradeoff or feel constrained. - There is no solution given existing game mechanics of this patch that reconciles the issue for small guilds without leaving them feel like they have LOST something (either their friends, or the ability to access content competitively).  It is crucial that someone in a position of power or influence understands that these are the perverse incentive structures that have been created.  ***Problem 2: Can small guilds even meaningfully DO the content?***  It is unclear at this point whether a small guild like mine, consisting of four to five players, should we at some point that we estimate to be 4-6 months of fairly constant play down the line, be able to spawn the guild events… can we even complete them?  Right now, the perception is that not only are small guilds, like mine, barred from playing with the new content, but that even if we somehow manage to push through and gain access to spawning them (something that will take us months, whereas large guilds will be able to do starting within days)… is this a type of content that we can even access?  This is not just a problem endemic to my guild. It is a problem endemic to EVERY small guild.  It is crucial that ANet understand their mechanic is DEEPLY divisive in the community and creates a structural environment that is fiercely pushing for the destruction of small guilds, and far more valuably all of those relationships, because the entire gameplay incentive structure rewards participating in large guilds and punishes participation in small guilds.  It is crucial that someone in a position of power and influence near the development team working on these mechanics understand that the impact this is having is **doing damage to the community** where the spoken intent of the mechanic is to **do the exact opposite**.  + **Problem-Solving Goals and Potential Solutions**: +  Before getting into potential solutions, it is crucial to understand both the problems and the goals that are to be accomplished by any proposed solutions. This seems trivial, but is a very common place where this kind of thing goes horrifically awry. (post 2/4)   EDIT: Formatting.",©

As it stands, you don't enforce a common language or communication in general during champion select. If the chat server disconnects us, we aren't booted from the game. If we are expected to conform to TheMeta™, shouldn't we be given the tools to avoid the place where the fights seem to commonly start?  &gt; Furthermore, if someone wants to go middle every game and believes that solo mid or duo mid are both options available to them, should any other player be allowed to report that person because they believe that they aren't following the de facto standard? What right does someone else have to say that anyone else is not cooperating because of their pick and where they are playing? To say that it is not cooperative can just as easily be flipped. The other person isn't cooperating because they aren't accommodating the situation just you allege that any other player isn't.  &gt; As a member of the bulk of the community, not the top 1% or even top 25%, we are begging for a stance.

Epub 2011 Feb 12.  Publication bias and time-trend bias in meta-analysis of bicycle helmet efficacy: a re-analysis of Attewell, Glase and McFadden, 2001.  Elvik R.  Source Institute of Transport Economics, Gaustadalléen 21, NO-0349 Oslo, Norway. re@toi.no  Abstract This paper shows that the meta-analysis of bicycle helmet efficacy reported by Attewell, Glase, and McFadden (Accident Analysis and Prevention 2001, 345-352) was influenced by publication bias and time-trend bias that was not controlled for. As a result, the analysis reported inflated estimates of the effects of bicycle helmets. This paper presents a re-analysis of the study. The re-analysis included: (1) detecting and adjusting for publication bias by means of the trim-and-fill method; (2) ensuring the inclusion of all published studies by means of continuity corrections of estimates of effect rely on zero counts; (3) detecting and trying to account for a time-trend bias in estimates of the effects of bicycle helmets; (4) updating the study by including recently published studies evaluating the effects of bicycle helmets. The re-analysis shows smaller safety benefits associated with the use of bicycle helmets than the original study. Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Curious what you think most e-mail clients do? Normally e-mail clients talk directly to the e-mail service provider and the exchange takes place just between your app and the service provider.   This application is a man-in-the-middle, from the sounds of it. To get your e-mail on your phone client, their servers grab it from your e-mail provider, and then re-deliver it to you. Completely different from using Thunderbird, Mail.app, Outlook, etc. where all your thousands of messages (and whatever other data like contacts, calendars) only exist in your mail client and on your mail hosting provider's server. The Mailbox servers maintain a copy of your mail information, outside of your mail provider and you.    There are various levels of app access on web platforms. Some use a service purely to authenticate users and sometimes some level of user data is exchanged.  Other apps talk the API of the service on your behalf. Others (like this one) give themselves (themselves being the company's back-end servers) full access to all of your information and actively harvest it. This type of access is actually very bad and any sane person should be concerned about this. Even if the company is Good and Honorable™, there's no guarantee your personal information won't be hacked by some hacker group (as having full access to your account from a third party introduces a new window of weakness), and then they find your name, address, what bills you have, and enough personal information that they can then do Bad Things like add lines of service to your cell account, purchase things in your name, and so on.   Paranoia aside, it's just simple prudence to protect one's digital identity and avoid applications that act in this manner.",™

It was not based on any ""scientific study""  I didn't say it was a scientific term, but it's more than a marketing term, it's a marketing *claim*: [""pixel density so high your eye can’t distinguish individual pixels""](http://www.apple.com/iphone/features/). It is, in fact -- for most people, at average viewing distances -- entirely true, irrespective of the scientific rigor (or lack thereof) with which this has been validated. We both know it to be true. And so we both know that increasing the pixel count beyond what you can see is wasteful, especially when this forces you to incur addition costs (to parts, battery size/weight/charge times, etc.)  &gt; What Apple did in order to call their devices as having Retina display was to simply DOUBLE the existing resolution of their devices.

t5_2qil9,ccp_manifest,1362051290,"EVE Online Surpasses 500,000 Subscribers Worldwide  Start of Game’s Second Decade Sees Most Explosive Subscriber Growth in its Rich History    REYKJAVIK, ICELAND – Feb 28, 2013 – CCP Games, the world’s leading independent massively multiplayer game studio, today announced their award-winning, sci-fi MMO EVE Online® had surpassed the 500,000 subscriber mark worldwide for the first time in the game’s history. The milestone continues ten consecutive years of subscriber growth and follows the December 4 release of EVE Online: Retribution, the game’s 18th free expansion and its most successful ever.   Also in December, EVE Online relaunched in China with new partner Tiancity to bring the same sandbox-style gameplay to a massive new audience where it has been thriving ever since.   In January, CCP’s DUST 514® a free-to-play massively multiplayer online first-person shooter, went into open beta and became available for free download exclusively to PlayStation®3 users worldwide. DUST 514 shares the same, real-time universe as EVE Online and player corporations can coordinate attacks between the two games.  This marked the first time two games from different genres have been linked together into one, massive online experience.   “Ten years after release, it is incredibly inspiring that, through a lot of hard work from our EVE Online team, we are crossing the half-million subscriber mark,” said Hilmar Veigar Pétursson, CEO of CCP. “For me, this is a true testament that EVE can live on forever, as long as we do right by her. We have not come to this point alone; millions of players have helped push us to this milestone. I now know in my mind what I previously only believed in my heart: that EVE will outlive us all.”   CCP will commemorate EVE Online’s tenth anniversary throughout the year under a unified “Second Decade” theme. The year-long celebration will kick off in late April in Reykjavik, Iceland with the sold-out EVE Fanfest, EVE Online’s annual player festival which will be streamed live online.  EVE’s official tenth birthday follows on May 6th and will mark the official start of the second decade of the EVE Universe.   Throughout the year, CCP will be supporting player gatherings around the world and holding in-game events to further the storyline of the combined universe as it continues to grow.

I still have dreams about it.  I'd never even heard of Ogden but I drove for a little while longer, started going down the other side of the mountain, and the instant I stopped driving vertically I was in the middle of town.

I guess most feminists are less crazy in real life? I sure hope so.  As I've stated before in here, I'm all for equality. But I guess a lot of people's main source of input about feminism *is* those of the loud minority on Tumblr / other websites, who will incessantly victimize / infantilize women so that they can feel like they are getting the most Oppression Points.  The problem with that is that people (like the author of the linked article) will then feel obligated to explain that they're not like that. I can see that getting old real quick o_o  Another problem (coming as a communication student here), I guess, is this:  Many (for lack of a better expression) ""internet feminists"" will appeal to pathos when they post about the patriarchy, oppression, or what have you. This will quickly devolve into a perception of them whinging about ""feels"" (which turns hilarious once someone mentions that some men have problems with feels as well, turning the internet feminists on to a rave about ""male tears"" or ""Teh menz"").  I think many of us are raised to appeal to ethos or logos instead of pathos; As a child, we are expected to not throw temper tantrums to get our way, but reason with our parents.   This probably leads to many (whether they think about it or not) more or less automatically dismissing genuine concerns if they are laced with too much pathos; Somewhere, subconsciously people are reminded of childhood lessons of appealing to a sense of reason to get their way.  As to things that women are expected by society to do to live up to an ideal of beauty...Well, some exist for men too. Admittedly, not nearly as many as for women.  I have to ask, though; On the subject of shaving legs, how many of the women in here do it *just* to live up to that ideal of beauty? Is there no purely ""selfish"" (for lack of a better word) enjoyment out of doing it?  I only ask because I shave my face every day. Not just because I tend to get a neckbeard if I don't (Now there's a term that's almost exclusively used to shame), but also because I ***really*** enjoy just taking those five-ten minutes each morning to lather on the shaving soap, and using the razor to get my face all smooth-shaven. Even if male standards of beauty were exclusively leaning towards having a Zach Galifinakis-type beard, I'd probably do it.",™

First, you are heating the soap, which softens it. Second, you are heating the air and water trapped inside the soap, causing the water to vaporize and the air to expand. The expanding gases push on the softened soap, causing it to expand and become a foam. Popping popcorn works in much the same way. When you microwave Ivory™, the appearance of the soap is changed, but no chemical reaction occurs. This is an example of a physical change. It also demonstrates Charles' Law, which states the volume of a gas increases with its temperature. The microwaves impart energy into the soap, water, and air molecules, causing them to move faster and further away from each other. The result is that the soap puffs up. Other brands of soap don't contain as much whipped air and simply melt in the microwave.  Also, the added air in Ivory soap is the reason it floats.  Not because is 99.99% pure.",™

Being able to receive and answer SMS/FacebookChat/Messenger messages without touching the phone at any point is a real advantage when driving (when not driving, it's kind of a gimmick, but can save you time when you need to type big texts)  On iOS or Android, you have to manually input the opening of the SMS and manually trigger the mic. The rest is great, but this simple manual opening is a pain when driving, and as such should be enhanced on iOS/Android.  When you learn a bit how TellMe works, it's actually quite amazing.

t5_2ryd5,speaktodragons,1362089022,"&gt;So you've just decided that supernatural events cannot be investigated through history? Why not? What is the basis of this assertion?  Give me an example were I am wrong in this assertion. Provide some examples that a ""supernatural event"" occurred and indeed it was supernatural.   &gt;Sure it is. And most agree on most things, the differences are normally around the edges. You won't find many who disagree on the divinity of Jesus or the authority of scripture. Although cannon may differ slightly, it's mostly the same. Especially the NT  If they did agree then they wouldn't need to branch off to so many forms of Christianity which only means the NT is not clear enough otherwise Christians wouldn't have to branch off to 1000's of denominations.   &gt;I never said that Christianity is consistent or infallible. But this is a product of the adherents, not the bible, which I hold as the ultimate authority. So show me a contradiction in the bible and I would question my faith.  Sure, everyone looks at same text and sees something different. Its a book or should I say a bunch of books that were tied together during the council of Nicea 325 apx, this is man's creation, not god.   No, its a product of the bible not the adherents. Clearly if the NT was that specific it was a authority people would get it and respect it, but every since the first bible came off the printing press anyone becomes a bible expert. The NT does not have or offer a system of self checks because if there was Christians could weed out bad ""fruits"". Look at the [Harold Camping event in regards to the end of the world.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Camping) Wrong, didn't happen, so what then, the guy retires. This is Christianity in a nut shell.    In regards to contradictions of the bible, there is no need to reinvent the wheel the [work is already done.](http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/jim_meritt/bible-contradictions.html)   What evidence other than just repeating resurrection story in a different format?   **Do you believe this happened as well?**  **Matthew 27:52** The tombs also were opened. And many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised,  [English Standard Version \(©2001\)](http://bible.cc/matthew/27-52.htm)  **Why should He have to appear to you personally?**  Oh not to me, My personal experience is not proof of anything especially in regards to the supernatural. God needs to talk to the entire UN general assembly, transparent, open, willing take questions. Wouldn't you like to come to some closure on the matter?   Which denomination is correct?   What about the other world cultures and religions?   What about Jesus returning?   Islam is true?   ",©
